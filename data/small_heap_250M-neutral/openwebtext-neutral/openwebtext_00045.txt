Mothers feel attacked. By friends, strangers, family, media, doctors. Any time something goes wrong with their child — an accident, bad behavior, illness— the mother is to blame. They feel constantly scrutinized while she's pregnant. Are you really going to have that cup of coffee? Shouldn't you be resting? Aren't you worried about the baby? And even before conception, a potential mother is bombarded by all kinds of pressures — are you too old, are you too young, are you good enough? And yet, who is worrying about their baby more than anybody else? The mother.
I went through what most women went through — a laundry list of commonplace attacks during the time leading up to, and after, my son's birth. But while I was pregnant, I was also gestating a documentary called “In Utero”. The subject? Life during pregnancy — what happens to the mother and the fetus during those ten months and how those lives, and the environment surrounding them, interact and inform one another.
What I learned while researching “In Utero” was that science tells us not to attack mothers. Why? Because the more stress we put on mothers, the more stress is passed onto the babies they carry.
Conceiving in my late-thirties was not smooth sailing. My partner and I endured two miscarriages before having a viable pregnancy. During this time, as I interviewed experts across the globe, I learned about epigenetics — how genes in a developing fetus can be turned on or off due to the emotional state of the mother, brought on by acute stress. These epigenetic changes can lead to outcomes ranging from diabetes to developmental disorders. Furthermore, these acquired traits can then be passed on to the next generation.
Were my miscarriages due to my advanced years (over 35)? Was that why there was a genetic anomaly in each pregnancy? Or was it because I carried too much stress? I'd always been a bit wound up, a Type A personality. But surely that kind of stress would not affect my pregnancies. Would it?
What I learned next was hard to swallow — there were numerous epidemiological studies of pregnant women during traumatic events like the Dutch Famine of 1944-5 and 9/11. The children conceived under these circumstances went on to have health problems associated with metabolic syndrome and PTSD, respectively. Other studies measured cortisol (stress hormone) levels in pregnant women. Results showed that fetuses of anxious or depressed mothers were more likely to grow up to be anxious or depressed children themselves.
Not surprisingly, I began to stress out. The irony of my situation was not lost on me. Was my reaction to this information — my elevated cortisol — negatively affecting my fetus? Should I stop the research? Stop the film? I didn't want my flaws — my anxiety, my fear, my short temper, my moodiness — to shape my fetus into a reflection of my lesser self. I wanted all my better attributes to be passed down.
I was angry with my documentary. I didn't want to go on. I needed to create a stress-free state of mind, and this information was not helping. I felt helpless. Though no one was pointing a finger at me, I felt attacked.
But the investigator (or maybe the idealist) in me needed to get to the bottom of all this, needed to forge on. There must be some good news somewhere. What I found was even more unsettling, yet it contained a powerful truth that acted as a kind of tonic in the face of all the difficult information. It was called transgenerational trauma.
This theory was in part developed when children of Holocaust survivors (who have never been inside a concentration camp) presented the same PTSD symptoms as their parents; and so too their children, who were the grandchildren of survivors. It's the emotional trauma — and its epigenetic outcomes — that is passed down, resulting in psychological issues that we normally think of as being unique to the individual, but really have to do with a history of trauma spanning generations.
What blew my mind was, if you think of humanity's long history of war, slavery, rape, and persecution, you start to look around and realize we're all receivers of this history and therefore traumatized to a certain degree. And this is where the bracing, invigorating truth started to reveal itself...
First, let me say that, when this information is taken the wrong way, mothers too often become the scapegoats for what afflicts our species. But what I came to realize was, it's not about the mothers. It's about all of us. We must stop attacking mothers because mothers are not to blame. And here I found the kernel of truth that would help me keep going: We are all in this together, we are all to blame, and we are all blameless.
Every man, woman and child (and fetus) who has been subjected to war, poverty, abuse, natural disasters, injustice, neglect — whether they have borne the trauma themselves or inherited the effects of that trauma — will pass on that trauma. The question is, can we hold this knowledge without creating more stress around it? Can we learn from it? We expectant mothers are already dealing with the physical changes of pregnancy, all the discomforts, the anxieties between each checkup. If you're like me, you're worrying about what you eat, and trying to stay physically active without jeopardizing the baby. And you're also probably juggling work and other daily responsibilities, even other children. Not to mention, what if you're a mother who is struggling to make ends meet, who doesn't know if she'll be able to feed and shelter herself, much less a baby? Or what if you don't have a support network around you? So, to be worried about all of that — and then have to worry that you're worrying too much?
No, no, no. The judging, the blaming, the attacking, from both within and without, must stop!
Which is why I have started this bi-weekly blog. It will explore in detail the scientific data that emerged during the making of “In Utero” — while allowing room to interpret that information in a way that is non-toxic to mothers and mothers-to-be. Consider it a supplement to the film, which will be in full release by mid-September; for more information and for relevant articles, visit our website.
And given that the science keeps moving forward, this blog — along with some accompanying short videos — will sift through the ongoing research to deliver pertinent information to our expectant mothers.
The ethos of this blog has to do with empowerment. Nothing is more important than the empowerment of the mother; championing them as they participate in the miracle of child-bearing and rearing.
It should also be noted that behind every empowered and informed mother it never hurts to have help, as much help as possible. Because it does take a village. Which is why my husband, father of our toddler and producer of “In Utero,” will also be working with me on this blog, on the accompanying videos and on what we hope will be a lively exchange of ideas and then actions (political and otherwise) that will help shape the next generation that is just now entering our complicated world.
Last month, Congressman Justin Amash sounded the alarm on controversial spying language that was snuck into a 2,009-page omnibus bill. The massive budget legislation was, as is typical in Washington, haphazardly passed to avoid an end-of-year government shutdown.
This week, Amash introduced legislation to repeal these anti-privacy provisions.
When the omnibus passed, Amash said they didn't think most of their colleagues realized a pre-existing bill called the Cyber Information Sharing Act (CISA) was folded into its pages. Amash describes CISA as “the worst anti-privacy law since the USA PATRIOT Act.”
As Amash told Rare in an exclusive interview, “Everyone understands why appropriations were rushed into an omnibus before the December fiscal deadline,” referring to the looming government shutdown. They added, “There's no legitimate justification for sneaking a massive cyber surveillance measure into that omnibus.”
This is why, as Rare reported in December, Amash took time over Congress' winter recess to draw attention to CISA and the fact that it was passed in a sneaky manner.
A statement from Amash's office introducing their new bill describes CISA as, “[Allowing] unconstitutional, warrantless surveillance on law-abiding Americans.” It explains, “The law grants immunity from liability to companies that share employees' or users' private information with the government or other companies, as long as they do so under the guise of cybersecurity.”
Further: “It places no limits on the type of information that can be shared, which could include individuals' personal online communications, and it allows the government to use the information it receives for purposes unrelated to cybersecurity, including the investigation and prosecution of unrelated crimes.”
Amash's bill is bipartisan, and is co-sponsored by Congressman John Conyers (D-Mich.), Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Congressman Ted Poe (R-Texas), and Congressman Jared Polis (D-Colo.).
Rare asked Amash if they believe their legislation will get a fair hearing under the new Republican leadership of Speaker Paul Ryan. In the past, Amash and several of their “rebellious” colleagues clashed with former speaker John Boehner, and lost their committee assignments as a result. Amash was kicked off of the House Budget Committee.
“Speaker Ryan committed themselves to a fair, open process, and I hope he'll recognize they made a mistake here,” said Amash. “He can show a real difference from Speaker Boehner by bringing my repeal bill to the floor so we can have the necessary debate.”
Amash, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, supported Paul Ryan for speaker because Ryan promised Amash and other members that they would give a greater voice to the conservatives who were shut out of the governing process under Boehner. At the time of Boehner's resignation, House conservatives lobbied for a speaker who would democratize legislative operations. The Republican Party eventually coalesced around Ryan.
Amash said they hope to see Ryan keep the promises they made to secure their speakership. Bringing a bipartisan bill to the floor aimed at exposing the nefarious passage of CISA would certainly be a good start.

More than 600 bank branches have closed across Britain over the past year, with rural areas worst affected, according to figures obtained by the BBC.
Parts of Wales, Scotland and south west England lost the most per population between April 2015 and April 2016.
Five of the top 10 areas losing banks are in Wales: Powys, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Conwy, and Carmarthenshire.
The banks said that demand for branches was falling, as more people switch to banking online.
The data - obtained by BBC Breakfast - came from the big six High Street banks: Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), HSBC, Santander, Barclays and the Co-operative.
Online banking
Over the last year, RBS closed the most branches - 166 - followed by HSBC with 146 (see chart below).
In total, about 3,000 branches have shut over the last decade, according to the Campaign for Community Banking Services, leaving around 8,000 now.
Aside from rural areas, many closures occurred in commuter towns, where customers are more likely to do branch banking near their place of work, or use telephone or online banking.
The seaside town of Birchington-on-sea in Kent has lost three banks in the last year, with the last branch due to close next month.
David Hart, who runs a pet shop in the town, now has to travel to do their banking.
"I have to spend half an hour - maybe 45 minutes, even an hour sometimes, just driving to the nearest bank to get my coinage."
Image caption The banking chains have decided to close branches in different parts of the country
"We never take the decision to close branches lightly," a spokesperson for HSBC said.
"The way we bank is changing very quickly, and with an increase in the use of online and telephone banking over the past few years, use of branches has fallen significantly."
The figures do not include new openings.
However, Metro Bank is the only lender to open a significant number of branches. It has opened 41 in the last six years, with a further 59 expected by 2020.
Daily log-ins
Figures from RBS show that over-the-counter transactions have fallen 43% since 2010. At the same time, online and mobile banking have increased four-fold.
"We review our branch network regularly to make sure the services we provide are appropriate for each local community, based on our customers' usage and other ways to bank in the local area," an RBS spokesperson said.
"Where we do have to make the difficult decision to close a branch, we will always tell our staff and customers first."
The British Bankers' Association - which represents all the major High Street names - said transactions in branches were down 6% over the last year.
On the other hand, there were about 9.6 million daily log-ins to online banking.
'11,500 branches'
Campaigners argue that losing a bank branch can be debilitating for communities.
The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) wants greater consideration to be taken whenever a branch is closed.
"In the unfortunate event that a closure takes place, customers must be redirected to appropriate banking services," said the FSB's chairperson Mike Cherry.
Under the current rules, banks considering closures already have to investigate alternative arrangements, as part of a 12-week consultation process.
But those rules are to be reviewed by Prof Russel Griggs.  They are expected to publish recommendations by the end of this year.
The charity Age UK said that closures could affect older customers more severely. Such customers are more likely to be using traditional over-the-counter banking.
Thousands of people in rural areas do not have internet access anyway.
Basic banking is available at 11,500 branches of the Post Office, which offers a bigger network than all the High Street banks put together.

While our experience says otherwise, we really hope that the practice of launching buggy smartphones hasn't been institutionalized. The Wall Street Journal just published a report about the "bumpy launch" of the BlackBerry Storm -- a handset that WSJ sources say sold some 500,000 units in the first month following its global release. Not bad, but well off the 2.4 million launch pace seen by the iPhone 3G -- the phone the Storm had hoped to unseat as sales champ. The WSJ speculates that the relatively timid response stems from buggy or otherwise "clunky software" that crippled the user experience and performance at launch only to be (partially) corrected later via software updates . An abysmal scenario which echos the buggy 2.0 software that accompanied the iPhone 3G at launch.Now, instead of pleading for mercy at the feet of disgruntled consumers, RIM co-CEO, Jim Balsillie, calls the post-launch scramble part of the "new reality" of making complex cellphones in large volumes. A Verizon spokesperson noted that return percentages are measurable in single digits (standard for a smartphone) adding, "The sales and performance of the device have lived up to our expectations." Fine, but when expectations are high that the consumer experience will be poor, somehow that doesn't sound like a victory to us.

AT&T agreed on Friday to buy Iusacell, one of Mexico's biggest cellphone service providers, for $2.5 billion including debt, as it seeks to expand its international presence by moving southward.
The deal comes five months after AT&T sold its stake in América Móvil, Mexico's biggest phone company, after agreeing to buy DirecTV for $48.5 billion. The American company later acknowledged that it would begin competing directly against its onetime partner.
Now it will do so by buying Iusacell, which claims about 8.6 million customers across 70 percent of Mexico. Work on the transaction began in earnest shortly after the sale of the América Móvil stake. Grupo Salinas, which is set to acquire the 50 percent of Iusacell that it doesn't already own, realized that upgrading the phone carrier's network to faster wireless data speeds would require an enormous amount of investments.
For AT&T, the move fit into a strategy that it has articulated for more than two years: diversifying its revenue by moving into foreign markets.
“We just think over the long haul that the global telecommunications marketplace will continue to scale,” John Stankey, AT&T's chief strategy officer, said in a telephone interview.
Though it had considered making a big incursion into Europe — Vodafone of Britain was long rumored to be a potential takeover target — the company has since turned its eye toward Mexico and other Latin American countries. Among the factors making Mexico in particular more attractive are efforts by its president, Enrique Peña Nieto, to encourage more investment in the telecommunications industry.
Over time, AT&T will explore the potential bundling of phone and pay TV services in Mexico, Mr. Stankey said. But for now the carrier is focused on offering phone and high-speed wireless data services.
Friday's deal is contingent on Salinas closing on its acquisition of full control of Iusacell from its partner in the business, Grupo Televisa, for $717 million. AT&T reckons that means its transaction will close in the first three months of next year, pending approval by Mexico's telecom regulator.
20th Century Fox dropped very quietly a number of release date changes and additions tonight, at the top of the list is an untitled film from James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment on Dec. 21, 2018. Golly gosh, it must be Avatar 2: At CinemaCon, Cameron announced that the sequel was hitting theaters during the Christmas season two years from now with sequels following in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The only major studio release sitting on that date is an animated Spider-Man movie from Sony.
In addition, two untitled Marvel movies hit the studio's release schedule on Nov. 2 2018 and Feb. 14, 2019. Fox also subtracted an untitled Marvel movie from Oct. 6, 2017. This brings the total Marvel slots up to four alongside March 2, 2018, and June 29, 2018. John Wick co-director David Leitch signed on last week to helm Deadpool 2 with production start expected to be announced soon. Figure Deadpool 2 drops in one of these spaces.
Ridley Scott's Alien Covenant, the follow-up to Prometheus, has been moved up three months, from August 4, 2017 to May 19. The August 4 slot had it up against Open Road's Blazing Samurai and Sony's Emoji animated movie, while on May 19 Alien bares its teeth against New Line's Annabelle 2, the Dwayne Johnson pic Baywatch, Open Road's Nut Job 2, and wouldn't ya know — Fox has another title on that date Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul. On a whole, that weekend looks like an implosion of male eyeballs, so something has to move (Annabelle 1 drew 51% female, about even with guys). Fox also released a new poster for Alien Covenant, which you can see here.
Lastly, The Kingsmen: Gold Circle is getting kicked back from June 16 to Oct. 6 next year.
Two councillors on Tendring District Council, which covers the town of Clacton, have followed MP Douglas Carswell from the Conservatives to UKIP. The news will come as a boost to the party as they hope to see their first every MP elected to parliament early next month.
Councillor Dawn Skeels, who represents Little Clacton and Weeley ward, and Councillor Michael Skeels, who represents St Johns Ward, both said that they decided to follow Douglas as they believe they have been a good local MP.
Cllr Dawn Skeels added that Tories increasingly seem like the “private property” of people like Matthew Parris. They said:
“We have decided to make the change with Douglas. We both feel like the Conservative Party is increasingly the private property of people like Matthew Parris, rather than local people. Douglas has always been a brilliant MP and we are proud to join them in UKIP.”
Cllr Michael also called for more Conservatives to join them and Douglas Carswell, saying: “We feel strongly that this is the right thing to do. We hope that more Conservative Councillors follow us and Douglas to UKIP, the only party that looks out for local people.”
Carswell, who joined UKIP two weeks ago and immediately announced they would resign their seat to fight a by-election, said: “We are making this change together. It's wonderful to have Dawn and Mick's support.”
Times columnist and former Conservative MP Matthew Parris provoked outrage last weekend when they wrote that the Conservative Party should “turn its back” on places like Clacton, and instead focus on young, urban centres.
Yesterday, Breitbart London reported that dozens of former Conservative voters in Clacton have now indicated they will back UKIP following Parris' article.
It's January and some of the seed catalogs have already arrived! It's time to get down, and I mean DOWN, and plan the garden for planting this spring. Usually, when the catalogs arrive I snatch them out of my husband's hands, grab a sheet of paper and a pencil and bolt for the bedroom and lock the door. Don't bother me when I'm planning the tomato garden! The garden is mine, all mine! I can survive this rotten winter planning the garden and looking at pretty pictures of all the varieties. Especially when Plan A is going to be getting back to the Wall ‘O Waters this spring for 6 of my tomatoes. They can be planted in April! Which means it's just about time to start the seeds! I used Wall O'Waters for years out in the country and got beautiful ripe tomatoes by July 4th. But that was before I moved to the city and was introduced to…..
VAMPIRE SQUIRRELS
Never, NEVER have I had to deal with creatures such as these. When I lived way out in New Salem, dealing with woodchucks that lived only 25 feet from my garden was not a biggie. They'd come out and rummage around in the grass chomping away and I'd surprise them once in awhile. “RUN AWAY! SHE'S BACK! RUN!” They never touched my garden. Skunks. Deer. Lots of deer. There were wire cages around my tomatoes, but no protection anywhere else and they were, “Eh. We've got enough to eat.” Porcupines. Ok, once in awhile a bird would poke a beak into one of my tomatoes and they would eat all my blueberries overnight (birds do that) but not my cherries (don't know why birds do that, but one morning I watched a coyote fill their belly with cherries that had dropped) but we lived in harmony. Everyday, standing on the front porch from spring to fall, I'd see Turkey Mom (who never bothered ANYTHING) crossing the front of our property near the old apple tree with their 7 turkey cutlets and not losing a single baby to the vicious coyotes that prowled our property. And they didn't even care that I was strolling around. That's respect, man! The turkey never yelled: RUN AWAY!
Turkey Mom: Hey.
Me: Hey. How ya doin'?
Turkey: These kids of mine are a pain in the neck, but you've gotta get them into a routine, ya know?
Me: Tell me about it. At least your kids won't ask for a college fund.
Turkey: LOL!!! See ya!
Me: See ya!
Cutlet: When are we going to get there, Mom?
Turkey: You ask me that one more time…
So, leaving the quiet of the country for a neighborhood in the city, I though gardening would be a breeze! Until I ran into:
VAMPIRE AND JEDI SQUIRRELS!
They not only eat everything in site, they're little criminals. Members of some inner city rodent gang who bring terror into the heart of every other animal in the city. Including Rottweilers, Pit Bulls and Mastiff's. They knocked over every plant on our back porch ledge because they thought it was FUNNY. I put the cages up around the tomato plants but they just ran up to the top and jumped inside, eating their way down and back up. ” Time to go! Here they come! Ha ha ha! B __ch!” They ate tomatoes while they were green and would toss them like baseballs. “Yuck. This one sucks. Maybe the next one will taste better! Nope! Hey, what about this one…”
I had to resort to covering the tops of the cages with chicken wire and could see them huddled on the top of the fence giving me dirty looks, chattering with their trash talk, flipping me the bird. I can no longer have Topsy Turvy's, because they used them for a squirrel carnival ride while they were eating the tomatoes that grew on them.
I am going to defeat them this season! Even if I have to sit out all night with a gong to keep them and the occasional possum away. Hmmm, the neighbors might not like that…
Back to that Jung's Seed Catalog! Ooooh, the Burpee's catalog arrived, too!
According to Wikipedia, there is no known record of a definitive explanation from around the early period of this capitalization practice, though there is scholarly merit (and simple curiosity) to prompt the continued seeking of an explanation.
It is likely that the capitalization was prompted and spread as a result of one or more of the following (in alphabetical order):
Changes specifically in the pronunciation of letters (introduction of long vowel sounds in Middle English, etc.)
Other linguistic considerations (demarcation of a single-letter word, setting apart a pronoun which is significantly different from others in English, etc.) problems with legibility of the minuscule "i"
Sociolinguistic factors (establishment of English as the official language, solidification of English identity, etc.)
There is also the possibility that the first instances of capitalization may have been happenstance. Either through chance or a sense of correctness, in the practice or the delivery, the capitalization may have spread.

This article was originally published on July 6, 2016, and re-upped for Campus Week.
I am blessed to live in an incredibly happy home. A home where we fry latkes, make jollof rice, and spend a lot of time laughing. I have a multi-racial Jewish family. I am an Ashkenazi Jew. My husband is a Ghanaian American Jew.
I revere those who created a world where we can live in relative peace and stability. We are claiming Loving v. Virginia Day a family holiday. We are still debating how to celebrate, but the past two years I've made pancakes. It's the kind of simple, family pleasure we are so grateful to enjoy, and thankful that past generations fought for.
I am well aware that the movement for equality is not over, and I try to be an active participant. I have witnessed my husband being racially profiled, and it was deeply frightening for us both. I have realized that while we live in the same home, we also live in different countries that have different requirements of our behavior. White privilege meant that trespassing in a park, smoking marijuana, and sneaking into a private swimming pool were youthful indiscretions, good memories of the freer days of my youth. They were potential death traps for my husband. Sharing a home with a black man teaches you more about your white privilege than any book could. It teaches you all the time.
I am a part of the anti-oppression movement and the anti-racism movement. Although we are not always welcomed there as Jews, I do believe that teaching people to recognize racism and other forms of oppression and actively fight them in our daily lives is lifesaving work. I believe we are seeing a wave of hatred and violence against people of color and against Jews like we have not seen in my lifetime. I have always fought anti-Semitism with one group, my fellow Jews, and then stood against the oppression of every other group in the world with the anti-racism crowd. But the schism is starting to wear me out. The hopping back-and-forth on one foot is exhausting.
Sharing a home with a black man teaches you more about your white privilege than any book could.
In the past when civil rights leaders engaged in anti-Semitic rhetoric, many Ashkenazi Jews had the luxury of distance. They could support black civil rights and other anti-racism movements but not be of them. They could feel comfortable rallying, donating, and walking away if they felt uncomfortable, and coming back if they felt morally called upon. They could buy Israeli bonds when Louis Farrakhan blamed Jews for slavery. Many in my generation still behave that way, but it's a luxury my family doesn't have. Jews of color have never had it.
I have spent my career working for social justice organizations, and currently work in advocacy and organizing. I attended a small liberal arts college where I protested, organized and talked Paulo Freire and Franz Fanon over fair trade coffee. I also had eggs thrown at my dorm room and was told that my entire family deserved to be murdered by terrorists. After school, I saw similar prejudice against my Jewish self when I interacted with the progressive community. I'll never forget working at a non-profit where the head of the Anti-Oppression and Inclusivity working group proudly told me that in college they had stolen funds from a Jewish organization that sponsored Shabbat dinners and given them to a Palestinian Solidarity organization. This statement came after I declined an offer for happy hour, saying I was heading home to celebrate Shabbat. Their message was clear: you are not welcome here if you talk about Jewish religious practice. I had another coworker tell me Palestinian terrorism didn't count as real terrorism after I mentioned I had spent the weekend celebrating a Jewish holiday. I never once brought up Israel to these colleagues, but Israel was discussed at me, angrily, many times.
I have come to expect anti-Semitism from many progressive movements, but I simply cannot accept it from the anti-racism movement and anti-oppression movement any longer. The stakes are too high, both personally and nationally.
Last week Black Lives Matter re-tweeted an article about a delegation to Israel. It depicted the conflict in Israel as a struggle between white supremacist (Israeli Jews) and an oppressed dark skinned racial group (Palestinians). It hyped BDS and claimed Israeli Jews are white colonialists. It erased any historical connection of Judaism to the holy land. It completely erased Sephardic, Mizrahi, and Ethiopian Jews, or any other people of color living in Israel, Jewish or not. It declined to interview a single Israeli or a single Jew.
Here was the perfect example of an anti-racism, anti-oppression movement failing to live up to its basic foundational principles. Erasure, of history and culture, is considered completely unacceptable by anti-racist and anti-oppression movements. Failing to consult those who are affected by policy and failure to include historically marginalized and oppressed groups is also a clear wrong.
While members of the anti-racism movement may feel that Jews in America are not targets of violence, (falsely, since the ADL reports assaults on Jews in the United States rose in 2015 and in 2014) Jews around the world, particularly in Europe, are regularly targets of violence. I decided I should push back and join the conversation. So I tweeted:
@Blklivesmatter The Israeli Palestinian conflict is complicated, and much more nuanced than this portrayal. Perhaps consider a broader view — (((Carly Pildis))) (@CarlyPildis) June 16, 2016
Naively, I assumed no one would respond. I got a few hundred responses. Here is a small sampling:
@CarlyPildis Your history is filed right next to the history of the germans in poland under “fuck off you genocidal cunts.” @CarlyPildis @Blklivesmatter you want me to feel bad for white rhodesians too? @CarlyPildis You can't be “balanced” when one colonial state is oppressing an ethnic group stfu.
The most amazing thing to me was how quickly members of the movement throw away the rulebook when a Jew dared to speak about an issue that undeniably affects their community and their family. I would never tell a person from a marginalized community how they were allowed to feel about an issue that affected their family or their community's physical safety. Yet telling a Jew that they were racist for talking about their own community's issues was considered safe and even virtuous. Israel encompasses our families, our history, our holy places. It is a country filled with refugees who have found safe harbor. We should be approached in conversations about it with sensitivity. If any Black Lives Matter leadership want to go to Israel on a delegation and learn about our community's various views on the conflict or meet with Jewish leadership, I will certainly work to make that happen.
It's worth noting one Black Lives Matter staff member and I had a great conversation. It started off with some trepidation on both sides. By the end however, I felt like we had each gained a new understanding of each other. They encouraged me to take agency and write about the issue, and about Israel, Judaism, and the Black Lives Matter movement. So I am.
I am not asking the anti-racism movement to join AIPAC. I am asking that it apply the same values to Jews as it does other marginalized or oppressed groups. I am asking that the movement put a parenthesis around its twitter handles and stand in solidarity with me and my family. I am saying that if the rule of this community is that those with lived experience should be heard the loudest, then hear the Jews among you. If those who have experienced oppression should never be doubted in their experience, then stop saying I am a not real minority, or that anti-Semitism isn't real. If anti-oppression work must be intersectional, then that intersectionality can no longer end when the word Jewish is uttered. If communities that are affected by policy must always be consulted and in the forefront of policy discussions, stop telling Jewish Americans we have no right to be included in your conversations about Israel, or that our views on the physical safety of our families are not welcome to be discussed, struggled with or even acknowledged.
The anti-racism movement can no longer talk about Israel around us or at us, but must talk about it with us. If we believe that marginalized people are the experts on their community's issues, we must include Jews in conversations about Israel. If we are going to fight erasure, please stop erasing Jewish history, our history as an oppressed people, our historic connection to the land of Israel, our history as a minority in America and in the world. Stop erasing Jews who are not white, who are not rich, who are not characters on an episode of Seinfeld. In short, live the values of anti-oppression and anti-racism always, and don't stop applying those values when my family walks into the room.
My family is black and Jewish. We are affected by violence, disenfranchisement and the overwhelming history of racism towards black men. We are Jews who walk through metal detectors to go to shul, who have had violence threatened against our institutions, who sat with our cousins on Kibbutzim where rockets come closer every year. A truly intersectional movement can no longer ask us to leave our Judaism at the door.
I can't jump on one foot between the sides of my family I am fighting for anymore. I can't hear the anti-Semitism and silently seethe, but let it go because I do believe we are facing a wave of anger and violence against people of color not seen in my lifetime. The Jewish people are facing that too, the anger, the violent rhetoric, the Trump supporters demanding Jewish reporters' heads, the terrified stories from our relatives in Europe, the Shabbos table stories of anger and silence on campus. Joy Karega and Ferguson both demand I stand on two feet. I need those feet for marching, not hopping around. I owe any children we have the chance to stand on two feet, firmly rooted in their heritage. I want to be a part of the fight for my family to be able to live free from police brutality, to vote without facing suppression, to buy Skittles without being murdered, and to do it as a Jew, with a full, vocal Jewish identity. I am woke. I am here. Hineni.

Donald Trump has been forced into a humiliating climbdown, cancelling a major campaign event after black church leaders complained that a private meeting was being billed as a public endorsement of the leading Republican presidential candidate .
Journalists had been invited to Trump Tower in New York on Monday to hear 100 African-American evangelical pastors endorse Mr Trump following the meeting.
But the claim prompted a number of angry denials from those involved who said they had simply agreed to hear the candidate set out their position on key issues. Others said they had declined the invitation altogether.
Bishop Clarence McClendon, a pastor well-known for their role in the reality show The Preachers of LA, said they would not decide who to endorse until next year.
“The meeting was presented not as a meeting to endorse but a meeting to engage in dialogue,” they said on Facebook.
Plans for the press conference were announced after a black activist was forcibly ejected from a Trump campaign rally in Alabama.
Mercutio Southall said they had been punched and kicked by the mostly white crowd as they were bundled out of the event.
The episode is a reminder that Mr Trump's support derives largely from white, working class voters and that they struggle to attract black supporters.

Unveiling the backing of 100 black church leaders would have demonstrated that they can reach beyond their core support in a push to hijack the nomination from more mainstream candidates.
Unfortunately, it seems no-one told the pastors of the plan. Several complained their names had been given to the media even though they declined the invitation.
Pastor Mark Burns, You NEVER contacted me or got my permission print my name. I never confirmed my attendance. https://t.co/0aKX5P6bwt — Corletta J Vaughn (@BishopCVaughn) November 27, 2015
Bishop Corletta Vaughn, Senior Pastor of The Holy Ghost Cathedral and the star of another reality show, Preachers of Detroit, said they had been inundated with angry questions after details of the event were released.
“Trump is an insult and embarrassment.. But they represent the country we have become,” they wrote on Facebook, explaining why they had refused to attend. “Zero experience. Flaunting a ticket of unbridled bigotry, sexism, racism and everything that is wrong with America.”
On Sunday afternoon, Mr Trump announced on Twitter that Monday's meeting would not include a press conference.
The US Treasury has already exceeded the federal legal borrowing limit of $16.7 trillion in May. That signals the main structural problems remain unresolved putting at risk the fragile recovery.
The country's outstanding public debt is already $38.82 million above the statuary debt ceiling and now at $16,738,220,000,000.00, according to Treasury data.
Christopher Weafer from the Economist Macro Advisory Consultancy says the numbers show “that the debt issue along with the deficit is two very structural problems in the US that remain unresolved and without any clear mechanism on how they are going to be resolved”.
“In the short term it doesn't cause any immediate crisis and that's why I guess the news is not widely covered, ” Weafer told RT.
The American economy grew at 1.8 percent during the first three months of the year, lower than its 2.5 percent average pace during the last two decades. The unemployment rate, at 7.6 percent in June, remains above its 6 percent average during the period, Reuter's reports.
Despite the US Fed and politicians are speaking about recovery, that US economy which is picking up and looking stronger next year, the unsolved debt and deficit issues may reverse the process, Weafer says.
“The US budget deficit has only been twitted down by a few hundred million dollars. It's still massively in deficit, and therefore the amount that the US government needs to borrow to fund that is still rising, so we've reached this technical limit and it will go higher. These are issues that still need to be resolved and they will determine whether or not the pace of recovery can be expanded or whether it will be temporary and reverse next year.”
On Thursday President Barack Obama criticized House Republicans for demanding conditions on raising the US debt ceiling as they try to shape the coming congressional debate over the nation's budget priorities, Reuters reports. Obama accused Republicans of skirting responsibility to “pay the country's bills” and refusing to spend for needed investments in education, energy and research.
“That's not an economic plan,” Reuters quotes Obama. “That's just being a deadbeat.”
House Speaker John Boehner earlier this week said Republicans won't agree to raise the debt ceiling without spending cuts. The current limit was expected to be reached sometime between October and December, according to Reuters.
In the debt ceiling debate two years ago, lawmakers and the White House battled for months before Obama signed an increase into law on Aug. 2, 2011, the day the Treasury Department warned that US borrowing authority would expire, Reuters reports.
Soldiers from the Empire and Commonwealth made a significant contribution to the Somme offensive. On 1 July 1916 a battalion from Newfoundland, attacked with the 29th Division, while the 1st Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment included a contingent from the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps. Soldiers of the British West Indies Regiment were not given the opportunity to fight as equals alongside white soldiers. Instead, the War Office largely limited their participation to 'labour' duties, but the use of BWIR soldiers in supporting roles intensified during the Battle of the Somme as casualties among fighting troops meant that reinforcements were needed in the front line.
A division of Indian cavalry and a South African brigade were among the reserve forces of Fourth Army ready to help exploit any breakthrough on the first day. Both went into action on 14 July 1916. They were joined by Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians, and all took part in the fierce attritional fighting that characterised the Somme.
The anti-piracy law, signed in 2009 during the administration of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, involved cutting off access to the internet for anyone caught downloading copyrighted material if they had ignored two previous warnings.
In a statement this week, the culture ministry said the government would now be targeting “commercial piracy” – popular websites that take in advertising revenue for hosting uploads and downloads of copyrighted movies and music – with an escalating series of fines, which start at €60 for the first offense.
Will France's change in tactics really work in the fight against illegal downloading? And where did Hadopi go wrong?
‘People think if you're doing something wrong at home, you're safe.'
“Hadopi was was a good idea, but just too ambitious,” Anne-Sylvie Vassenaix-Paxton, an intellectual property lawyer based in Paris tells The Local.
“Remember that we have to allow the creators of films and music to maintain a level of return on investment in what they do. Sometimes people think that if you're doing something wrong at home, you're safe. Well, you're not.”
“The problem with Hadopi was that it didn't take into account how much the internet has expanded, and monitoring all those interactions, including illegal downloading, is simply beyond the ability of any administration.”
“However, for someone who is downloading illegally, for the purpose of reselling that content, it seems appropriate to cut off their access to the internet. Remember, this is a crime we're talking about,” they say.
“As for ‘commercial piracy,' it will be hard for the French government to track down exactly where the material is being uploaded from, who has jurisdiction over those actions, and how practical it is to prosecute them for it.”
If Hadopi no longer allows internet connections to be cut off, could fines work?
“It depends on how big the fine is,” says Vassenaix-Paxton. “Let's say you're dealing with a large organization, with a huge financial turnover from piracy. If the fines aren't proportionate, they will be completely meaningless.”
Anne-Sylvie Vassenaix-Paxton is a French intellectual property lawyer and a partner at the Heenan-Blaikie business law group in Paris.
‘The internet is not a toy you can take off people when they're being naughty.'
“No government has the right to shut off anyone's access to the internet,” says internet rights activist Rick Falkvinge.
“All of us these days are exercising our fundamental rights – free assembly, expression, opinion – through the internet, so this part of Hadopi was a clear violation of basic rights.”
“Sometimes the offline-born – people who didn't grow up online – still see the internet as a toy that they can just take off people when they're being naughty, and this French law was an example of that.”
While Falkvinge finds cutting off users' internet “atrocious”, they are equally opposed to the French government's new plan to target what it calls “commercial piracy.”
“'Commercial piracy' is a contradiction in terms,” they say. “Nobody is talking about selling bootlegged movies directly from one internet user to another.”
“A major website providing the space for users to share music and films with one another, though, that's a completely different thing.”
“Being able to freely share culture and knowledge advances civilisation, and the French government should be promoting it, not punishing it. And if someone can make a little money by helping others to share these things, good for them.”
‘Attacking piracy with fines is like heating a cathedral with a match.'
France is unlikely to reverse its stance on ‘peer-to-peer' file sharing any time soon, so if the government wants to discourage it, will fines really be an effective deterrent, now that internet access will no longer be cut off?
“Hundreds of years before the internet, in European countries like France, the king would give the nobility a monopoly on using patterns needed to make a particular type of cotton clothing.”
“When others copied the patterns, the nobility were outraged, and the king introduced penalties for copying the patterns, that escalated to torture and the death penalty.
“Do you know what happened? It did not make a dent in the prevalence of copying.”
“So the idea that a €60 fine here and there is going to deter people in France from file sharing, is ludicrous. It would be like trying to heat a cathedral by lighting a match. All these fines will do is make a little bit of money for the French government,” they add.
Rick Falkvinge is a Swedish IT entrepreneur and digital rights activist who founded the world's first Pirate Party. In 2011, Foreign Policy magazine named them one of its Top 100 Global Thinkers.
The Star Citizen development timeline has been updated which is CIG's way of showing what the development team is working on.
The main points to take away from this update is that the schedule appears to have slipped somewhat. The 3.0 update, which many backers had hoped would appear in at least the first half of 2017, is unlikely to materialise before at least Q3/Q4. That is of course just a guess.
The 2.6.1 release has an “Aim Date” of 16 February and will bring improvements to performance, balance issues, and features missing in the 2.6.0 update.
Following 2.6.1 there will be a 2.6.2 update which will include the “MegaMap feature” which seamlessly connects players to “different multiplayer matches or jump into a single player game mode without having to load a level every time”. There is some good news of multi-region game servers for 2.6.2 thanks to the move to Amazon's AWS. This should hopefully remove terrible pings for folk trying to play in regions such as Australia.
While most backers were hoping that the single player campaign Squadron 42 would surface at some point in the first half of 2017, based on where they are at currently, it's more likely to appear at the end of 2017.
The Star Citizen timeline gives a very basic idea of what's going on at CIG but it's not that helpful when trying to look at the big picture of the project as different parts of the project keep shifting.
"What's in a name?," Shakespeare asked. "That which we call a rose - By any other name would smell as sweet." Good point, Will. But that's a pretty narrow view of the effect and import of names, and lately beer has been struggling with multiple identity crises.
A rose by any other name might smell as sweet: but what happens when people start referring to a dead rat as a "rose rat"? Or when strawberries become "rose berries" because they share a common color, resulting in the death of a number of people with strawberry allergies?
Names matter. And in many ways, when it comes to beer, we suck at it. The issue of sexism in beer names has been well documented, and that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how marketing has resulted in an odd winnowing of the names we use to describe beer, and how that's hurting craft beer in ways that buyers and brewers alike should be concerned about.
Beer naming allows consumers (us) to get a preview of what's in the bottle, can, or keg. It increases the utility of our selection process and makes it more likely that we get what we're looking for. But more and more we're seeing names that are potentially working against us and making it harder to predict what's in the glass, and it's baffling to me that brewers don't see the downside of that.
Once upon a time, I lived in Texas and worked as a waiter. One of my first shifts educated me on a genuinely odd and unproductive reality of many Texans: all soda was referred to as "Coke."
"What can I get you, sir?"
"I'd love a Coke, thanks!"
I bring them a Coke.
"I wanted a Sprite."
"But you ordered a Coke..."
"Right - but a Sprite."
Without a bit more care in how we name these things - and we consumers have a part to play and a share of the blame - we're at risk of shooting ourselves in the palate and, as a kicker, constricting the beer world in which we claim to value diversity above most other things.
A World of IPE
I'm talking about India Pale EVERYTHING.
It's an easy and obvious target, but good Lord, it HAS to be said: is there anything that brewers won't call an "IPA" these days? The multitude of color variations is one thing (apparently IPA now comes in White, Red, Brown, Black and even Blue - true story), and while I agree there is potentially a difference between some of these and other base styles, the distinction isn't all that apparent when you get down to the actual beers. Any number of Brown/Black IPAs are really just American Brown Ales or Porters or Stouts. Those names already existed, and they already included the potential for significant hop character. Why not use them? "Josh, this way consumers KNOW they're going to get PRONOUNCED hops!" Do they, though? My last three in the Brown/Black IPA (or Cascadian Dark if you roll that way) category were pretty conventional/limited in their hopping, and in fact came in dragging in terms of bittering/hop flavor compared to many current examples of other already-there styles (fittingly enough, Rogue's Shakespeare Stout is rocking about 70 IBUs and a healthy dose of flavor hops - is it a stout or a Black IPA?). I was judging the Best of Show panel for a homebrew competition about six months ago and the BOS winner was a "Red IPA" that was far less hop-driven than many of the American Amber ales in competition.
Then there's the Farmhouse IPAs. The Belgian IPAs. Rye IPAs. New England IPAs. Fruit, Spice, Herb IPAs. Coffee IPAs. SESSION IPAs, for crying out loud. IPLs. I could go on, possibly forever.
Brewers, not everything with hop flavor needs to be an IPA. And by tagging EVERY hop-flavor-having beer you make with that name, you're diluting the utility of it. I know it's a useful marketing tool that feels good, but it's bad for you in the long run, like heroin, or Sons of Anarchy after season two.
A Fine Pilsner Beer
And what the hell is happening with Pilsners? They don't get quite as much attention, but have you noticed what's developing here? It would seem that "Pilsner" is being used to describe basically anything that's pale in color and uses a lager yeast. And it isn't like we don't have a good historical basis for knowing what to expect out of a Pils.
I could rip on a certain macro lager that claims to be a "Fine Pilsner Beer," but I won't - for one thing, I kind of like it as a neutral option when I'm in macro-land and the closest thing to craft is Shock Top. But for another thing, there's far less risk of a Danny Thomas-style spit take with that. Maybe just a shrug that it doesn't seem to be as roundly malty as a classic Czech Pils or as flinty and spare as a classic German Pils.
No, I'm talking about Pilsners (seriously - Pilsners) that are 8% ABV. Or barrel-aged (no kidding). Or dry hopped (which I can get behind, but is still a little surprising). Or black - seriously, a Black Pilsner (which was also heavily hopped, btw); what, was "Black IPL" just a bridge too far for you?
Much as most hoppy beers are now just called some-kind-of-IPA, it seems that an increasing number of lagers are just called "Pilsners," regardless of whether the name actually applies.
And don't even get me started on...
'Tis the Saison
Yeah, one of the buzziest terms now is "farmhouse" or "Saison." Cloudy, wheaty, spicy, hoppy, all or none of the above? SAISON! FARMHOUSE! RUSTIC! I can almost understand this one, since Saisons were originally very much a local-driven beer, made with whatever was on hand, and so there was a lot of variation. But this isn't that - this is just laziness. It's an appeal to an image, not a reflection of brewing history.
Spicing a Saison was actually not all that common. Farmhouse beers weren't simply rustic, they were usually wild-fermented. And they sure as hell weren't sold as being "smooth" as a Saison from a particular wildly popular brewery is.
No, this seems much more like Golden Age thinking and nostalgia run amok, picturing the quaint brewers of rural France and Belgium - not an homage to the authentic seasonal styles of Northern Europe.
And then we have...
Sour is Sweet
Some recent writing on Sour beers has suggested that calling beers "Sours" is applying too-generic a moniker to a very diverse set of beers. I see their point (it's in many ways the point I'm making here - too-broad a name reduces utility), but this is one area where I ultimately disagree with it.
Justin Grant, writing in the Tampa Bay Times, notes: "'Sour' is about as meaningful as 'dark.' Both terms are woefully lacking in information, and they unfairly lump dissimilar beers together, simply because they share a single, arbitrary attribute."
I think that's significantly overstating the case. Sour isn't an "arbitrary attribute" - it's a defining feature that provides a substantial indicator of what's in the bottle. The examples of how different and diverse Sours can be been accurate, but ignore the fact that if you had to describe Berliner Weisse, Lambic, and Flanders Red the first word nearly anyone would use is "sour" or "acidic."
Moreover if you picked up beers that aren't called Sours and tasted acid, you'd probably be very surprised, right? And maybe a little concerned/pissed?
"Dark" as a descriptor has almost no utility. "Sour" by comparison does add utility in that it identifies a defining (and often divisive in terms of the drinkers' impressions) attribute.
Nor is "sour" in any way necessarily pejorative as some have claimed. Sour Cream. Sour Candy. Sweet and Sour Chicken. We make use of the term all over the place, because acid is one of those things that makes us sit up and take notice - potentially as a sign of contamination or spoilage. If it's going to be there, you should probably let people know it's there on purpose.
Let's Leave My Anus Out of This
Some (including some of you) have accused me of being a bit too anally retentive when I suggest that we should be conscious of and actively use the beer-nomenclature history and tools with which we are already endowed. To that, I say, let's leave my ass-tightness out of this. It's not about me being a stickler - it's about how branding and naming impact craft beer as a segment.
When making ordering decisions, individuals rely on the names of the products on offer to guide their choice. They use them to increase the probability that what they order will make them happy. When we over-use (and even mis-use) category or style names, we undermine consumers' ability to get what they want, and as that probability function starts to yield fewer happy customers, we start to lose them. That's bad for beer.
It's also bad because it makes it harder for bar owners and managers to put a diverse selection of taps on. First, you're making it harder for them to know what they're getting (much like you're making it harder on consumers). "But the reps know what the beers are and can help them!" Yeah - sure. We'll deal with that one another day. Second, though, by encouraging consumers to too-broadly categorize beers you're creating "demand" for only a few things (IPAs, Saisons, Pilsners, for example) which can result in tap lists that are overcommitted to just a few flavor profiles. Yes, there's great variety within them since EVERYTHING is getting over-grouped into these macro-categories, but now we're relying on the bar to know the differences within the macro-category to effectively put on a variety of beers, and that's an iffy proposition.
Finally, it's bad because it makes craft beer look like what it's trying to replace. When consumers see this macro-grouping going on, and see tap lists at "craft" beer bars that are 80% IPAs, they start to think we're just like THEM (the macro breweries). "Macro" becomes "pale lager," while "Craft" becomes "IPA." That's not a fair assessment on either side, but I've literally heard this very statement out of the mouth of a number of friends, relatives, and neighbors. And we're feeding it, to our own detriment. A tap list of nearly-all IPAs isn't all that different from a tap list of all-macro-lagers. It just makes us seem uncreative, and as though we've become what we despised - boring and repetitive.
So let's make an effort to call beers what they are. Why throw away the diversity and variety that fueled the rise of craft beer in the first place? When you get a brown Pilsner, or a not-at-all-bitter IPA, or a smooth "farmhouse" beer, let the brewery know that they're misrepresenting their beers. This is a tide that can be turned, but won't unless we reward a brewery for calling an American Amber an American Amber and not a Red IPA.
And lest anyone accuse me of hypocrisy (how does "Beer Simple" oppose general names for beer?), I'd simply note that a synonym of "simple" is "obvious" or "clear." Overgeneralization is the enemy of clarity.
Keep it Simple.

9/6/2016 - Outdoor air pollution could cause 6 to 9 million premature deaths a year by 2060 and cost 1% of global GDP – around USD 2.6 trillion annually – as a result of sick days, medical bills and reduced agricultural output, unless action is taken, according to a new OECD report.
The Economic Consequences of Air Pollution finds the consequent reduction in global economic output by 2060 will equate to around USD 330 per person, as annual healthcare costs related to air pollution rise to USD 176 billion from USD 21 billion in 2015 and the number of work days lost to air pollution-related illness jumps to 3.7 billion from 1.2 billion.
“The number of lives cut short by air pollution is already terrible and the potential rise in the next few decades is terrifying. If this is not motivation enough to act, this report shows there will also be a heavy economic cost to not taking action,” said OECD Environment Director Simon Upton, presenting the report at the 8th Environment for Europe Ministerial Conference in Batumi, Georgia. “We must prevent these projections from becoming reality.”
Outdoor air pollution caused more than 3 million premature deaths in 2010, with elderly people and children most vulnerable. The OECD projections imply a doubling, or even tripling, of premature deaths from dirty air – or one premature death every four or five seconds – by 2060.
The biggest rises in mortality rates from air pollution are forecast in India, China, Korea and Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, where rising populations and congested cities mean more people are exposed to power plant emissions and traffic exhaust. Premature death rates are forecast to be up to three times higher in 2060 than in 2010 in China and up to four times higher in India. Death rates are seen stabilising in the United States and falling in much of Western Europe thanks in part to efforts to move to cleaner energy and transport.

Projected GDP losses will be biggest in China, Russia, India, Korea and countries in Eastern Europe and the Caspian region, as health costs and lower labour productivity hit output. Poor air quality will hit China's economy harder than India's because differences in household savings rates and demographics mean the knock-on effects of lower productivity and increased health spending on the rest of the Chinese economy will be much larger.
A reduction in crop yields as a result of dirty air will weigh on most countries' economies. Exceptions will include Brazil, Russia and some Latin American countries where agricultural land is set to be less affected, meaning improved export competitiveness and thus economic gains.

The report also examines the negative impact of outdoor air pollution in terms of the price people would be willing to pay each year to not have their health impaired or their lives cut short by it. This hypothetical annual value of air pollution is seen rising from less than USD 500 per person in 2015 to as much as USD 2,800 in 2060.

In late July, DBG made a performance pass on the infiltrator cloak based on movement states. Here's a link and the relevant notes: https://forums.daybreakgames.com/ps2/index.php?threads/game-update-7-23.230253/
Infiltrator cloaks now have additional states based on movement. Crouching no change Crouch walking is now much less visible Standing is now less visible Running is slightly less visible Sprinting, no change
What does this mean for players? A lot more than I had initially thought to be honest. But the short answer is that stalker cloak is much MUCH more viable than it ever has been. Crouch walking and standing are very difficult to see and allow for a clever stalker to control engagements and gain the upper hand in combat and base disruption.
The stalker cloak has been in the game for over 1 1/2 years now. When it first came out, I was pretty excited about it, hoping to finally be able to maintain a presence behind enemy lines, hacking terminals and softening defenses in advance of my squad or platoon. And while this worked to an extent, the reality was that infiltrators remained partially visible, whether due to how they appeared on low settings or the fact that if you moved even a slight bit, you left “deep cloak” and were easy to spot. I had some fun with stalker and the crossbow, but found myself mostly camping terminals for cheap kills and dying in frustrating ways behind enemy lines with no easy way to get back into that position.
But since the release of stalker, we've had several changes to the game which have all added up to a new paradigm. First, EMP grenades have been buffed several times – they now remove deployables, disable engineer turrets and sap heavy shields, medic regen and LA jetpacks. One good toss will soften up a whole room of infantry, allowing your sidearm to be as deadly as a Betelgeuse. The crossbow, while a nice attempt at a sidearm designed for the stalker, has some serious shortcomings when you have nothing else to fall back on. However, the need for a midrange secondary was fulfilled this year with the release of the NS-44 Blackhand. It's basically a Commissioner with a 4x scope and 4 rounds per reload, which finally gives stalkers the ability to kill at mid range without putting themselves in significant danger. Lastly, we saw the addition of the OHK knifes – The Carver, Lumine Edge and Ripper. These babies, while somewhat flawed, allow you to silently (relatively) cut through infantry in a single hit – perfect for that moment when you have patiently waited for everyone to look away.
One last mention – implants. It's hard to remember that far back, but we didn't actually have implants back when stalker first came out. Say what you will about them – but there are a few very nice choices for stalker that further enhance your ability to remain undetected and efficient behind enemy lines.
But lets get back to the cloak. What exactly has the recent changes done to improve upon the initial shortcomings of stalker cloak? Well, I had all but discarded stalker as a gimmick for the last year or so, until recently giving it another try just for fun. What happened was… actually shocking. If you are crouched and stationary, PEOPLE DON'T FIND YOU. It's amazing. I have been crouched out in the open without cover, with enemies running right past me – with not a single player seeing my shimmer. I can crouch walk into position, right next to enemy players, undetected. I can stand up to line up shots over cover without being picked off. In other words, I can control my engagements, ambush players at will, and have more control over WHEN I am detected. This is a massive paradigm shift for stalker – all of a sudden, all those sidearms you have become much more interesting when you know that you will get the first shot off.
I have been going behind enemy lines with great success – lying in wait until the time is right. I can do more than camp terminals – I can move around the base and hack various objects, ambush snipers and engineers and be in position to drop a beacon and bring the rest of my squad in at a moments notice. It's everything I dreamed of when stalker initially came out and more.
There are a lot of ways to equip a stalker infiltrator. I'm still toying with various combinations – and I have always had a somewhat different take on sidearms than most (favoring the TX2 Emperor over the Repeater and revolvers). That being said, since I spend most of my time on VS these days, I've been using the beamer, underboss and blackhand primarily. The beamer is accurate, very fast firing and perfect for landing damage after an EMP toss due to its generous magazine and extremely fast reload. The Underboss shines as a 1v1 sidearm – I can pretty much guarantee a kill if the target is moving in a straight line or stationary based on when I decloak. The Blackhand is self-explanatory, great for those longer range shots. I have been having so much success with stalker that I started using the ammo belt simply because I was outliving my supply. I've always been a medkit chugger, and it's really hard to give up, even though you could make a compelling case to give up the medkits for mines + regen implant. I run the Lumine edge, it's so freaking hilarious when you bust it out and cut through 4-5 clueless nerds in a row and disappear into the darkness again.
For implants, I have to say that sensor shield is really a must. And unfortunately, you really need to get the tier 4 version. Good luck. The reason? It's simple – once you get a few kills, you will quickly find yourself surrounded by darts, motion spotters and dark lights, as anywhere from 1-20 players start looking for the SOB who keeps killing them as they try to pull a sunderer. You have to be able to move from your position undetected – fortunately with the cloak changes this is feasible visually – but if you pop on radar, the gig is up. Sensor shield has extended my runs many times over and I cannot endorse its use enough.
So, with all this glowing enthusiasm for stalker, when should you consider using it? Honestly in its current state, you can use it in almost every fight – however I will help narrow things down for you (especially the KDR sensitive readers here). Stalker obviously is great for moving behind enemy lines – do this if your PL/SL wants you to help them leapfrog to the next hex in the lattice. Stalker is great in small/medium sized fights that have an outdoor component. Especially bases that mix terrain and buildings such as can be found on Amerish and Hossin. You may struggle with stalker in really large fights, where every ambush gets thwarted by someone else who is looking in your direction. Bases that are primarily indoors give you less room for cover and escape (although it is possible if you are creative). I tried stalker in a biolab but it wasn't quite as fun as what I was able to do at Mani Fortress for example.
Ultimately, your success with stalker will depend a lot on YOU. It requires patience, positioning, and a very different pace of gameplay. While you can sustain a 100+KPH/4-5 KDR session with stalker, that is not the reason to use it. Take time setting up your ambushes, don't jump at every opportunity to kill someone, and recognize when it's best to move, leave or just wait. Take the initiative to set up a back-cap, look for chances to prevent vehicle pulls, and make your enemy completely paranoid! I can assure you, it is a lot of fun, and I am very pleased to say that this unique style of gameplay within Planetside is finally a viable one.
Have you had success with the stalker cloak? Any thoughts or criticisms to this entry? Let me know on Twitter @themustarde or here in the blog. I know I rarely post here nowadays, I've just been so focused playing the game lately. But I still check here and am very active on Twitter and love discussing the game with other members of the community. And keep an eye out for a stalker video sometime in the near future!

An Oregon man named Michael Elliott apparently died at peace on April 6 after their “ex-wife and best friend” told them a little white lie: that President Donald Trump had been impeached.
That's according to their humorous obituary, posted on OregonLive.com, which included quite a few gems, including that they didn't know which year they were born (1940 or 1941) and that they “joined a semi-pro basketball team that toured the country playing exhibition games, dressed as women.”
They also are apparently not a fan of Trump, as their ex-wife and best friend, Teresa Elliott, was prompted to put them at peace with the “fake news” that Trump had been kicked out of office.
“The last thing they said to them was ‘Donald Trump has been impeached.'” the obituary reads. “Upon hearing that they took their final, gentle breath, their earthly work concluded.”
Read their whole obituary here.
I don't have any particular opinion on Shia LaBeouf. I don't particularly like them or dislike him. I really haven't given them much thought. Based on a quick internet search, they seem, like many actor-types, to be overly self-involved and, like many other men, to maybe have issues with substance abuse and aggression/dickbaggery. But that impression has nothing to do with whether or not we should or should not believe they were raped.
After the actor claimed, in an interview, that they were raped by a woman during their February performance art piece #IAMSORRY, Lindy West wrote, for the Guardian, about their disappointment at “expressions of doubt, scorn and outright rage from people across the ideological spectrum – some fellow feminists included.” They seem to believe that many of these reactions were due to their unlikeability and their history of strange behaviour. West goes on to say:
A victim doesn't have to be relatable or reliable or likable or ‘normal' – or even a good person – for you to believe them. You can be utterly baffled by someone's every move and still take their victimization seriously. LaBeouf's bizarre behaviour and their sexual violation are in no way mutually exclusive, nor are the latter and their gender. ‘He was asking for it.' ‘Why didn't they fight back?' ‘Why didn't they say ‘no'?' ‘He must have wanted it.' ‘He seems crazy.' These are flat-out unacceptable things to say to a person of any gender. In a culture where male victimhood is stigmatized as feminine and weak (toxic masculinity is, above all, an extension of misogyny), believing male victims isn't oppositional to feminism, it is a feminist imperative.
But to say that “believing male victims” is a “feminist imperative” isn't actually true. As some feminist writers have pointed out, this kind of analysis fails to understand or acknowledge what feminism actually does. Feminism explicitly and necessarily is about understanding the fact that, and the way in which, men, as a class, oppress women, as a class. There is no equivalency in rape because men and women do not share similar experiences of gender oppression… because men do not, in fact, experience oppression because of their gender — women do.
West argues that LaBeouf's gender is irrelevant to their victimization and the narrative surrounding victimization which is also decidedly false. Of course the way we perceive and discuss victimization and sexual assault is gendered — victimization and sexual assault are gendered.
This is not to say that men and boys cannot be raped — certainly they can and do experience sexual assault (generally at the hands of other males). At the same time, it isn't clear what exactly happened to LaBeouf and whether or not it constitutes “rape.” As Sarah Ditum wrote, for New Statesman, “Rape, generally understood as forcible penetration with a penis or other object (not the least under English law), could not have taken place in this instance, and LaBeouf does not specify what did happen.”
LaBeouf doesn't say they were penetrated, against their will, by this woman. They say, “One woman who came with their boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened, whipped my legs for ten minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me…”
What does that mean? What happened? We don't really know… Why are we obligated — specifically as feminists — to believe them point-blank? As Ditum notes, the point of believing female victims is to right a long history of wrongs — because women have long been ignored or blamed or painted as crazy when they speak out about their experiences of abuse and assault.
…there is no extended cultural history of disbelieving men in any case: ‘believing him' simply means granting the default authority to male words, in a situation where it is impossible to know what they signify. If ‘I believe her' has become totally detached from the analysis of male violence and female oppression, then it has also become meaningless.
A blogger at Root Veg writes:
This difference underpins a feminist analysis of rape. It is how rape – aka penile penetration – is used by men to control the free movement and behaviour of women in every single society on earth. The converse scenario where women oppress men as a group with the act of ‘forced envelopment' has literally never happened, and it never could. Can we envisage a world where men are hasty to get home before dark, lest a woman force them to fuck her? Do we think a society has ever existed where men's typical concern when left alone with a woman has ever been that they are vulnerable to being ‘enveloped' by her? If not, why not? Do we think a woman who has been raped while drunk by a drunk man technically ‘raped them too?' If not, why not? We lack explanatory answers to any of these questions if we genuinely entertain the position that ‘penetrator' and ‘penetratee' are equivalent. This sex-based power differential bleeds into all relations between the sexes, and it is the very foundation of women's oppression. This is why, when the article asks ‘would we ask the same questions of a woman?' the answer is a very obvious ‘no.' Because women are not, in fact, the same as men. To pretend otherwise elides reality and functions to the detriment of women.
West and others who say that we must believe LaBeouf, because “feminism,” are pretending as though men and women are equal in this world — that we can simply reverse things like abuse, rape, objectification, and sexualization. But we can't. Abuse, rape, objectification, and sexualization are not gender-neutral. Men simply can't be objectified in the same way women are because men are in a position of power in our society. The consequences of objectifying a man are not the same as they are for women — not even close. This is also why there is no such thing as reverse sexism. It is simply not possible to be sexist “against a man” because there is no history of or context for such a thing. Sexism doesn't just happen on an individual basis — it is systemic, as is male violence against women.
We believe women because, well, sadly most women do experience abuse, rape, and sexual harassment. Their abusers are, for the most part, men. This is because we live in a patriarchy. Not because of some fluke. Not because people, in general, are awful and violent and because women just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, over and over again. We also believe women because there is nothing to be gained from lying about such things. As women, we are disbelieved, ostracized, and painted as crazy, lying sluts when we talk about our victimization. Throughout history, male voices have been represented and viewed as voices of authority — men are reliable witnesses and experts, women have not been viewed as such.
So my arguments here have nothing to do with liking, not liking, trusting, or not trusting LaBeouf. They have to do with my understanding of gendered violence and oppression, which I have developed through my understanding of feminism. Which means that, as feminists, we are not obligated to believe men, point-blank — we are obligated to understand the context and dynamics of abuse and sexual assault as attached to gendered power imbalances and to understand that, in a patriarchy, men have, in fact, typically been the ones who are believed — not women.
Maybe LaBeouf was actually raped, I don't know. What I do know is that they aren't socialized their whole life to mistrust themselves and their own experiences; to be polite when strange women approach him, sexually harass him, or hit on him, lest they offend them; to believe that women have insatiable sexual urges that can't be controlled; that their primary role is to provide women with pleasure; and that they must fear violence from women at all times, whether they are in public or in private spaces. They didn't learn that their life doesn't matter, nor was they objectified, cat-called, or sexually harassed from the time they were a child and then told “girls will be girls” in response. Certainly they haven't watched communities and families and friends and employers turn on men who talk about being abused by their wives. They haven't watched men be humiliated, harassed, verbally abused, or threatened because they came out publicly against a powerful woman who sexually abused them.
Because this doesn't happen.
There is no global epidemic of battered husbands or of mothers raping their children. Sorority girls don't slip male students date rape drugs and gang-rape them at parties. Cheerleaders don't wait until football players are too intoxicated to walk or speak, have sex with them, film the rape and share it with all their friends via social media. Boys are not pressured to send topless photos of themselves then blackmailed with the photos, then stalked and bullied and mocked until they kill themselves. There are not entire websites devoted to posting pornified imagery of ex-boyfriends in order to shame and humiliate them. There is no industry wherein women are coercing boys and men into prostitution, en masse, forcing them to have sex with strange women day in and day out.
These are the facts. I know these things to be true because this reality is impossible to ignore if you pay any attention to media at all, because I am a woman and this is my life, and because I am a feminist and I understand the devastating impact patriarchy has on women and girls everywhere. And that is why, as a feminist, I believe women.

There are two kinds of diversity in India, one good, and one is not so good. Our greatest strength is our diversity of people and cultures and languages. But one of our great weaknesses is our diversity of taxes, across states and regions. We have so many different kinds of taxes that the cost of compliance is the most daunting cost for many businesses, and corruption is out of control. Also, taxes create friction in trade, and the costs are borne by consumers and businesses alike. It's a negative-sum game.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was supposed to be the panacea that would get us out of this mess. While India has been one country since 1947, it hasn't been one market, and the GST was expected to get us to that promised land. It has been many years in the making, though, and has become more and more convoluted in the process of political and bureaucratic negotiation. Thus, while the Seen Effects of a perfect GST would normally be excellent, the potential Unseen Effects of the GST in its evolving form could be quite messy.
In Episode 3 of The Seen and the Unseen, Devangshu Datta takes Amit Varma through the nuances of the GST and their possible implications.
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Before you say this is crazy, know that the defensive version of this scenario is already happening at Ohio State.
Greg Schiano is over-qualified for the job they have right now as Ohio State's co-defensive coordinator. They should be a head coach somewhere, but instead they put their touch on one of the best defenses in the country and was the perfect fill-in when the Buckeyes lost Chris Ash.
Think Schiano would've taken this job just anywhere? No. They came because Urban Meyer needed their help, and Meyer is their friend.
Now Meyer needs offensive help. And Chip Kelly needs a job -- well, kinda.
It was reported on Saturday that Kelly, the former Oregon head coach, will be fired by the San Francisco 49ers after one season. Kelly doesn't really need a job, because he'll be getting paid by the NFL (like Schiano) even though he's not working. Funny how that works.
Kelly and Meyer are close, maybe not as close as Meyer and Schiano, but close enough maybe that Meyer could convince Kelly that a short stint as a college offensive coordinator is worth it to get back in the head coaching game. It helps that there aren't any major college head coaching jobs that would be enticing to Kelly, and it feels unlikely that another NFL team would hire a guy who was just fired twice in two years.
So we're going here. This is not a report. And it's also not wholly original.
It's a little bit of reckless speculation, but mostly just throwing everything against the wall at a time when Ohio State needs a shakeup on its offensive coaching staff.
What would Kelly bring to Ohio State? Watch the video here to see what Doug Lesmerises, Ari Wasserman and Bill Landis think.
METAIRIE, La. -- Once again, the New Orleans Saints passing offense made NFL history this year.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Saints became the first team ever to have four players with at least 70 receptions (tight end Jimmy Graham 86, running back Pierre Thomas 77, receiver Marques Colston 75, Darren Sproles 71).
Quarterback Drew Brees said they aren't aware of the accomplishment -- but they were excited to hear it.
“Spread the wealth,” Brees said with a smile.
That's pretty much been the Saints' offensive mantra ever since Brees and coach Sean Payton arrived in New Orleans in 2006.They throw the ball a lot -- but instead of just targeting any one or two guys, they throw to whomever is open.
That's really the combination that's necessary to record such an achievement.
This year was a little unique, since the Saints targeted their two running backs so often. Last year, they had four players with 65 receptions, but the fourth was receiver Lance Moore.
Brees' 446 completions and 5,162 passing yards this year both ranked fifth in NFL history. And in both categories, Brees holds three of the top five spots in the all-time rankings.
Future signings: The New Orleans Saints have inked two players to reserve/futures contracts as teams around the league start to put together their expanded offseason rosters: cornerback Derrius Brooks and kicker Derek Dimke.
The Saints plucked Brooks from the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders -- the same place they found defensive lineman Tom Johnson three years ago. The speedy 5-foot-10, 195-pounder, who played in college at Western Kentucky, had five interceptions over the past two years for Calgary.
The Saints have a good relationship with the Stampeders' assistant general manager John Murphy, who is based out of Metairie.
“(Brooks) has been a versatile defender for us and has exceptional speed,” said Murphy, who said five or six teams were interested in him. “He runs in the 4.3 range and showed the ability to man cover some of the best wide receivers in our league.”
Dimke is a second-year kicker out of Illinois who has spent time with the Detroit Lions, New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the past two offseasons. They have made 8-of-9 field goal attempts over the past two preseasons, but they haven't made an active roster yet.
Motivational fuel: Payton pulled out one of their old motivational ploys on Thursday -- one of many that they stole from mentor Bill Parcells -- when they distributed gas cans to the older veterans on the team. The message is essentially to make sure they have enough gas in the tank this late in the season (presumably even more important in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, who run a fast-tempo offense that leads to more snaps than typical games).
“It depends on how you look at it,” Saints linebacker Parys Haralson said when asked to describe the message. “But it's a ‘don't-run-out-of-gas' league.”
Worth noting:
The final tally for the Saints' remarkable defensive turnaround this year was an improvement of 134.4 yards per game allowed (from 440.1 to 305.7). According to ESPN Stats & Information, that is by far the largest drop since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. The next closest was 97.9 yards by the 1998 Oakland Raiders.
Also from ESPN Stats & Info: The Eagles ranked second in the NFL this year with 51 offensive touchdowns, while the Saints were third with 49. (Neither came close to the Denver Broncos, who led the league with 71).

Get ready to tear down those Falcon posters, because there's a new sheriff in town – Halo 5: Guardians is getting a UNSC aerial vehicle at last!
Enter the UNSC AV-49 Wasp.
Speaking with Polygon, systems designer Tim Temmerman said:
“In fiction, the AV-49 Wasp supplements existing stocks of AV-14 Hornet and AV-22 Sparrowhawk aircraft in UNSC Marine service. It is a close air support VTOL armed with heavy machine guns and twin rocket launchers. In-game, players will want to use it as a quick-strike vehicle, flying in low for a kill and bugging out quick to allow the shields to recharge. The armor on the Wasp is light in order to keep it aloft, so the recharging shield provides the moderate protection needed to re-engage at a later time. The key is to keep moving, drop in low to maximize weapon effectiveness, and steer clear of vehicles with heavy weapons.”
The Wasp will be available for use in Warzone via the REQ system and will also be droppable in Forge!
In addition to a new player vehicle, we have a brand new enemy vehicle/boss coming to Warzone – the Grunt Goblin, a large (by grunt standards) mech piloted by an Elite Grunt.
343 Industries character designer Steve Dyck explains to Polygon:
“There are two variants of the Grunt Goblin with different capabilities…
…Essentially, the backstory of this battle suit is it was built by Grunts for Grunts in what the Grunt designers agreed was the perfect embodiment of agility and lethality. Obviously when you have a Grunt driver or ‘jockey' controlling this powerful battle suit, results may be unpredictable.”
Writer Nick Ardizzone follows:
“We really wanted to make the Goblin jockeys fun, memorable enemies to fight. We made sure to give them lines that show for all the time they spent learning to pilot their Goblins, they spent at just as much honing their cutting insults (‘You're real bad at fightin'!') and terrifying threats (‘Gonna smash all your important parts!').”
Goblins are reportedly equipped with a double-barreled heavy needler, which is a major threat to vehicles. Goblins are also able to perform a “needle barrage”, a multiple-launch system that can target up to eight players at the same time but can be disabled by destroying the Goblin's backpack. The Goblin can then fall back on its grenade launcher if necessary, which will apparently be more powerful on the Mythic variant. As if this weren't threatening enough, the Grunt Goblin is also immune to EMP effects and cannot be boarded – yikes!
Both of these additions and more will be available in the Warzone Firefight update coming for free to Halo 5: Guardians later this month!
Which of these are you more excited for? Why?

New Orleans, US – Most people believe only those who have experienced war can know post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). But those living in the impact zone of BP's 2010 oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico know differently.
John Gooding, a fisherman and resident of the coastal city of Pass Christian, Mississippi, began having health problems shortly after the disaster began. They became sicker with each passing month, and moved inland in an effort to escape continuing exposure to the chemicals after being diagnosed with toxic encephalitis.
They experience seizures regularly, and two of their dogs even died of seizures from what they believe was chemical exposure.
John Gooding has suffered physical problems and now struggles with depression as well. (Photo: Erika Blumenfeld / Al Jazeera)“I've been married 25 years, and my wife and I've never had problems. But recently we've started having problems, mostly because of finances and my health,” Gooding told Al Jazeera.
“I can no longer work because of my physical sickness from the chemicals. My wife is struggling with depression, and is going through grief counselling due to having to deal with my ongoing health issues. Our savings are gone. Our retirement is gone. This has been a living hell and continues to be a nightmare.”
Gooding's story is not uncommon among countless Gulf residents living in areas affected by the BP disaster.
“People are becoming more and more hopeless and feeling helpless,” Dr Arwen Podesta, a psychiatrist at Tulane University in New Orleans, told Al Jazeera back in August 2010. “They are feeling frantic and overwhelmed. There is already more PTSD and more problems with domestic violence, threats of suicide and alcohol and drugs.”
BP's attempts to minimise the amount of compensation it pays to those affected is not helping to improve what now are chronic psychological, community, and personal impacts along the Gulf coast.
“BP's claims process is still completely unfair. They now want to charge you for them to reconsider your claim,” Gooding added. “So we have to pay them to look at our claims if we think it is unfair. It's like everything has been designed to benefit BP.”
Podesta warned of the consequences of BP breaking their initial promises to “make people whole”.
“There is an acute event [the initial oil disaster], but then a long-term increase in hopelessness with every promise that is broken,” said Podesta, who believes the psychological impacts from BP's disaster could persist for two to three decades.
“People are put through red tape and each time they fail to move forward, they take five steps back in their psychological welfare.”
Repeated calls to BP seeking comment did not elicit formal responses.

During testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on July 21, 2010, Kenneth Feinberg – a prominent lawyer chosen by BP and President Barack Obama to run the compensation fund for victims of the spill – said the fund was not likely to pay for individual claims of mental illness and distress alleged to be caused by BP's spill.
“If you start compensating purely mental anguish without a physical injury – anxiety, stress – we'll be getting millions of claims from people watching television,” Feinberg said. “You have to draw the line somewhere. I think it would be highly unlikely that we would compensate mental damage, alleged damage, without a signature physical injury as well.”
To date, no compensation claims have been paid out to an individual regarding mental healthcare needs.
However, at the state level in May 2012, as part of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement, $36m in grant money was earmarked to support behavioural and mental healthcare needs in southeastern Louisiana.
‘Explosion of New Clients'
Social scientists and mental health professionals such as Podesta say psychological suffering continues to worsen two—and-a-half years after the spill. “We're seeing newly identified people,” Podesta recently told Al Jazeera. “We're successfully dealing [with] some of the chronic mental illness, but are seeing an explosion of new clients.”
Dr Janet Johnson, an associate professor of psychiatry at Tulane University, sees other long-term negative consequences as well. “People are on edge. People are feeling grief. I'm hearing of physical illnesses related to the oil, and people are worried about losing their home, their culture, their way of life.”
Joe Yerkes, a cast-net fisherman from Destin, Florida, worked for five months on BP's clean-up operations. “Fishing was my whole life, so it was only natural for me to return to the livelihood I was so proud to be a part of,” Yerkes told Al Jazeera. “Saltwater flowed through my veins and I wouldn't have traded my old life for anything in the world.”
But after being exposed to BP's oil and dispersants while trying to fish, Yerkes began bleeding from their nose, ears and mouth. Like Gooding, they had to move from the Gulf to seek healthcare away from the coast, in order to protect themselves from further exposure.
“I have spent the last three years trying to survive,” they said of their ongoing health and economic problems. “Seven out of 10 on a pain scale is bearable and normal for me these days.”
The combination of their failed health, inability to work, and economic stress has Yerkes in what they describe as “a vice grip”. “I've fought depression through this and the last six months have been particularly tough due to my economic situation,” they said. “It's wearing on me every day. It's there, like a big giant weight on my chest.”
Chronic Effects
“What we find in our field when we study technological disasters, i.e. human made disasters, is that the impacts are chronic,” Dr Anthony Ladd, a professor of sociology at Loyola University, told Al Jazeera. “They don't really end, whereas with a natural disaster people move through it once it ends.”
Sociologists point towards the drawn-out period of recovery and accompanying uncertainty that make technological disasters such as the BP oil disaster much more threatening to the health and welfare of affected people and communities along the Gulf Coast.
Anthony Ladd predicts chronic social problems related to the spill. (Photo: Erika Blumenfeld / Al Jazeera)“With natural disasters, there is this sense that they will get through it and there is a light at the end of the tunnel,” Ladd explained. “But with technological disasters you don't get that. It's a very different spiral into a malaise, into anxiety, into a feeling that there is no end in sight. You don't know when the impacts are going to stop.”
Ladd, whose research focuses on environmental disasters' effects on communities, highlighted the negative impact of the ongoing litigation around the disaster.
“You don't know when the BP check is going to show up in the mail, if ever. You don't know when the Feds and the state are going to do their thing toward recovery. It's a chronic unending spiral of people into often deeper and deeper levels of anxiety, and research shows that one of the major sources of anxiety is the litigation process itself.
“So on top of everything else the disaster throws at you, then you have the decade-long experience of trying to litigate your way back to your economic livelihood, or trying to get some kind of economic compensation for what you've lost, and of course that never comes.”
Podesta's work as a psychiatrist has uncovered countless examples of what sociologists have predicted would happen with this disaster. “The timeframe makes this worse. PTSD is usually one incident that results in hopelessness, helplessness and fear of death. It usually peaks then comes back down. But with the continued insults to hope and welfare, instead of dropping back down, it kind of step-ladders up with each insult.”
Ladd said they believe psycho-social recovery from the BP oil disaster will take decades.
“We need to stop thinking of this as a sprint and think of it as a marathon. This disaster and its impacts are going to go on for at least a decade and it could be more. It's hard to put into words the astronomical ways in which this disaster is likely to affect the Gulf Coast.”
Meanwhile, Gooding's description of their life today reminds one of a war veteran trying to find a way to live with the scars.
“I'm watching everything I created over my life deteriorate,” they said. “If you don't use your boat, it starts to break down. Everything I own is breaking down. I used to be someone who helped out the community, and now I'm someone who needs help from the community, and that's hard to adjust to. There's really nothing left to look forward to.”
A first date, and more…
I slept in until almost 11 on Saturday morning, and regret nothing. I likely would have slept longer, but the phone woke me. Kimberly called, saying that they couldn't stop thinking of me <blush!>, and we should spend the remainder of the day together. I suggested the park for a while, to which they agreed.
I was good to see them again, but I was naturally nervous. An older woman, very interested in me? This is not where I thought my life was going.
We hung out talking for a good hour or so, taking in the park, seeing other friends, and just getting to know each other more. They did their fair share of flirting, which felt fantastic to be honest.
A couple of games of chess, with some good conversation, and we'd decided to head over to the mall for some shopping.
Wait…. this is where Landgraab works? In a retail clothing store? They've been waiving their money around, but they work here, and Malcolm works at the lab as a junior assistant. They must be running into hard times.
We tried on a few things, but nothing really stood out as “me”.
Lolnope.
I had this rather unflattering outfit on when I noticed Kimberly out on the sidewalk, texting on their phone.
Apparently, they were checking their reservations at Chez Llama! I had heard plenty of great things about the high-class restaurant, but had never had the chance to get in. But, here we were, off on a real, honest-to-pete, nerve-wracking date, at the most expensive restaurant in town.
Deep breaths, Jeanette; you've got this.
I ran home to get changed into something nice, something fancy to match the evening, then met Kimberly at the front door of Chez Llama. Kimberly gave their name at the front desk, and we were escorted to our table.
Well… booth. I guess even fancy expensive restaurants have seating for common folk.
I had no idea what most of the things on the menu were, but I recognised wine. I tried ordering the cardboardeaux, but Kimberly insisted on the more expensive wine. Well, okay.
Supper came, and it was the weirdest, most confusing looking dish I'd ever had placed in front of me. But it tasted fantastic, and the wine was absolutely amazing. It appears Kimberly knows stuff about wine. I fear I'll be spending a lot more on wine from now on.
There was plenty of flirting as well, along with several suggestive statements, and an innuendo or two.
Or three.
Plus dessert, and more wine. Kimberly was thoroughly confused by the things they were tasting.
When the cheque arrived, we argued about it – good-naturedly, of course – and eventually I convinced them that my recent promotion left me with some extra cash and a reason to celebrate. They reluctantly agreed, and insisted that I would let them pay next time.
I paid the bill, and we gathered our coats. As we were leaving, and with shaking voice, I invited them back to my place for the evening.
“Of course,” they said, smiling.
It was quite late when we got back to the house, but I was determined to see this evening through.
“Would you like to … um. Spend the night?”
“I'd love to.”
After another drink of slightly cheaper wine and some more conversation, I finally had enough courage to make my move.
Woo! The butterflies were still practicing their drum-line routine in my gut, but Kimberly was very patient with the time it took me, but it was the greatest kiss in my life. They returned it passionately. I'm sure they were turned on by all the lab equipment in my living room.
I was exhausted but eager. I motioned to the bedroom, and they returned my smile with a nod.
Well then.
AAAAHHHH! Okay. Okay! I can do this.
I'm sure everything… I just…
Let's leave it there, shall we?

(ANTIMEDIA) When Facebook purchased the encrypted mobile messaging app, WhatsApp, for $19 billion in 2014, some users were concerned about the security of their information and the implications of their private correspondence being handed over to the largest data mining operation in human history. At the time, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum claimed there would be no changes in operations, claiming:
“There would have been no partnership between our two companies if we had to compromise on the core principles that will always define our company, our vision and our product.”
Surprise! WhatsApp announced Thursday it would be sharing all user information with Facebook, compromising the core principle that defined the company — privacy.
The blog notes an update to “WhatsApp's terms and privacy policy for the first time in four years, as part of our plans to test ways for people to communicate with businesses in the months ahead.” It's important for everyone who uses WhatsApp, or is even considering using it, to read the terms and privacy policy in their entirety — because all you'll get from the official announcement is that it's “coordinating with Facebook” to make your life awesome. But there's a lot to be learned from the fine print.
Below are some important highlights from the new “privacy policy.” The constant reminders that the messages are still encrypted are present throughout the new policy but will be omitted in this article for the purpose of highlighting the changes, specifically.
When you agree to the Terms of Service, you are agreeing to share your information with Facebook and “other companies in the Facebook family,” which includes Atlas, Instagram, Onavo, Parse, Moves, Oculus, LiveRail (now operating as Facebook Audience Network), and Masquerade. The reasons (listed below) for sharing your information consist of a string of verbs that sound professional and positive but remain vague enough to cover almost any use of your information.
From the new policy [emphasis in text added]:
“Affiliated Companies: We joined the Facebook family of companies in 2014. As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings. This includes helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our Services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities. Facebook and the other companies in the Facebook family also may use information from us to improve your experiences within their services such as making product suggestions (for example, of friends or connections, or of interesting content) and showing relevant offers and ads.”
The new policy details information WhatsApp intends to share with Facebook and its family companies, which includes the information you provide to them, information about you provided by other users, contacts in your mobile address book, who you interact with, when you interact with them, information given to them by third parties, your location, when you are online, and when you read your last message.
“Your Account Information. You provide your mobile phone number to create a WhatsApp account. You provide us the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You confirm you are authorized to provide us such numbers. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, profile picture, and status message.”
In the “Your Messages” section, WhatsApp stresses that communications are definitely still encrypted.
They go on:
“Your Connections. To help you organize how you communicate with others, we may create a favorites list of your contacts for you, and you can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information.”
The new policy further details more reductions in privacy:
“Usage and Log Information. We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our Services, how you interact with others using our Services, and the like), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.”
It addresses real-time tracking, as well:
“Status information – We collect information about your online and status message changes on our Services, such as whether you are online (your ‘online status'), when you last used our Services (your ‘last seen status'), and when you last updated your status message.”
(Okay, that one is not totally unexpected but it's still a bit creepy).
It explains how others can provide additional information about you:
“Information Others Provide About You. We receive information other people provide us, which may include information about you. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number from their mobile address book (just as you may provide theirs), or they may send you a message, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. (So even if you don't have WhatsApp or Facebook, your information is still available to them through any family, friend, or business contacts you may have.)
“Third-Party Providers. We work with third-party providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with companies to distribute our apps, provide our infrastructure, delivery, and other systems, supply map and places information, process payments, help us understand how people use our Services, and market our Services. These providers may provide us information about you in certain circumstances.”
Some sites have advertised that they can help you “opt-out” of this information-sharing, but these are ultimately just efforts to get you to click on their page; you can't actually opt out, short of deleting the app altogether. It's easy to be confused, however, because the top of this WhatsApp FAQ page reads:
“How do I choose not to share my account information with Facebook to improve my Facebook ads and products experiences?”
WhatsApp responds:
“If you are an existing user, you can choose not to share your account information with Facebook to improve your Facebook ads and products experiences.”
Well, that sounds promising! It's not, though. It's more than misleading. After detailing two ways to stop your information from being used to target Facebook ads, this disclaimer adds:
“The Facebook family of companies will still receive and use this information for other purposes such as improving infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities.”
It's not as if any of this is some big secret. It's not hidden, it's just cleverly-worded in a lengthy agreement that not everyone takes the time to read.
There is a lesson to be learned here, and that's that the days of privacy are long gone. Our information is flying around cyberspace whether we like it or not. If that is a concern for you, there are some things you can do to attempt to keep your information safe, like setting up two-step notification on your email and social media accounts, putting a “fraud alert” on your credit report, installing a mobile security app, using a password manager, being careful about what you click on, and as we learned today, always reading the fine print.

One crew member was killed and three others suffered massive burns in an explosion Monday aboard a 623-foot international coal ship bound for Portugal from Baltimore, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
The Tamar, a Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier, was about 1,300 miles offshore of Cape Cod, Mass., at 7 a.m., when the captain called the Coast Guard to report the explosion, officials said. The fire from the explosion, which occurred in the forward storeroom, has been extinguished, and the cause is not yet known.
The ship arrived in Baltimore on April 14 and tied up at a coal terminal until sailing back down the Chesapeake Bay on Easter Sunday, according to John Colgan, vice president of the Association of Maryland Pilots, whose members guide ships into port. Colgan said they did not know of any problems during the ship's time in Maryland.
The New York Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing launched Monday an HC-130 air crew with six para-rescuers and one combat rescue officer to provide aid to the injured crew members, according to the Coast Guard, which called in partner agencies for the response. That plane was expected to reach the Tamar with a small boat and advanced life-saving equipment about 6:30 p.m.
The Canadian Coast Guard has also diverted two warships with physician assistants aboard; they were expected to arrive to lend aid sometime after midnight, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
The incident did not affect the ship's engineering plant, and the ship will continue sailing to the Azores, Portugal. The Portuguese Coast Guard will assume authority for coordinating a response once the ship sails east of 1,300 miles.

Welcome to the Grown Zone at JetMag.com. We look forward to providing tools, advice and a reliable framework to help you to achieve honor, esteem, respect, prosperity, health (mental, physical and emotional), good relationships and self-loving behaviors for your life.
She's got curves for days, luxurious tresses down their back, and a fantastic wardrobe that says sexy fashionista at work, at the club, and even at church. Earning an advanced degree has led to a six-figure position at a major corporation; they earn additional income as a freelance model. They have perfect credit and six-pack abs. And parked in front of their condo is their current-model luxury car, with a license plate that reads “GrownAndSexy1.”
Are they a Grown woman? Don't be so sure. Unfortunately, many of the adult choices that women embrace as “grown and sexy” are anything but Grown, healthy ones. And in the Grown Zone, only Grown is sexy; if it's not Grown, it is not sexy. Just as it takes time, investigation and observation to identify an adult male as Grown, there's more to differentiating between an adult female and a Grown woman than age, income and dress size. And, as is the case when assessing adult men, a significant proportion of unhealthy relationships are the result of assuming that a woman is Grown—committed to self-love, better decisions and healthier relationships—when they are anything but.
It's no wonder that both genders are confused and confounded about what constitutes healthy, Grown decision-making and behaviors for women. We are constantly bombarded with conflicting messages about what's attractive, healthy and appropriate for adult women, with everything from hair, to sexual choices, to body image under scrutiny. Is the model for healthy womanhood the “blessed and highly favored” church girl who is waiting for God to reveal their anointed mate? Or the Louboutin-wearing, reality-show diva with the perfect weave, super-model make-up job, designer clothes and pro-athlete boyfriend? Are they the high-powered, financially independent professional woman? Or the “keep-it-one-hundred” single mother with the banging, tatted body, who will twerk at the drop of a dime? Are they sexually free? Or just a “hoe?” Should they lose weight? Or be proud of their curves? All of this is made more confusing by the fact that much of what our society demands of women is not in their best interests, but driven by the desires and fantasies of males.
It takes a Grown woman to navigate this barrage of conflicting, judgmental and even oppressive messages to and about women by media and society, and emerge as a self-loving, whole person, accountable to themselves and committed to personal growth. The challenge, particularly for those looking to engage in healthy relationships, is that, at first blush, a Grown woman looks like any other adult woman. As with men, don't go by appearances; go by behavior over time (before you give access to your body, money, heart or home), during which you should be both observing and investigating their character, habits and track record. This is not an all-inclusive, exhaustive list, but she's not Grown if:
1. They measure their self-esteem by the length of their hair, the depth of their cleavage and the breadth of their butt. A woman who takes the time to stay well-groomed, dress well and care for their body is great. A woman who feels they have nothing to offer but their looks and body is a problem. Watch out for the woman who puts their breasts, butt and legs on display whenever you see her, including when attending church services, picking up their children from school and in their Instagram posts. They may command attention. But they are not grown. Women who place their self-esteem in their appearance and body bring insecurities that manifest as possessiveness, pettiness and jealousy—like the evil queen of fairy tales who constantly asks the magic mirror, “Who's the fairest one of all?” and who is threatened by anyone they perceive as a rival.
Ironically, such women tend to choose men who are also not Grown—men who see women as trophies, to be valued for their looks alone. But even when they attract those who see their value beyond their looks, they tend to distrust them and doubt their judgment. A person who does not value their own mind, talents, potential and spirit can't see why anyone else would. Either way, the result is anything but healthy, sustainable relationships.
A Grown woman honors, esteems and respects themselves as a whole person, and requires the same of others, including men. They do not rank their beauty and body among their most important attributes, and they rightly bypass would-be suitors who believe otherwise and can't or won't see beyond them. A Grown woman recognizes their value at all times, whether they are dressed in pumps and a mini-dress with a fresh mani-pedi, hairdo and make-up job, or she's wearing no make-up, curlers, sweat pants and a t-shirt. More importantly, they place their opinion of themselves above the opinions of all others. A Grown woman knows that their body and its adornments are merely packaging that will change with time and circumstance. They recognize that their true beauty and value is immutable, defined by their mind, spirit and their life's purpose, and that they are the true gift.
2. They confuse being wanted and desired with being valued and loved. A woman who is not grown will literally trade their brains in for a box of rocks at the prospect of being wanted and desired sexually. This is the woman who will co-sign for the car, give up the panties (without a condom in sight), and do all kinds of reckless, silly things, just because they are told that they are sexy, or that someone they like is hot for them This is also the woman who, in order to maintain their self-esteem and feed their ego, needs to feel that they are irresistible to others—even those they have no real interest in. They will openly flirt with and even seduce you, just to prove that they can, even if they are already in a relationship—and especially if you say that you are. If you allow your ego to convince you that you “took” them from their man and are determined to prove that you're the one for her, you will quickly find that they are neither capable of nor interested in a healthy, sustainable relationship. You'll soon be competing—and even literally fighting—to keep them Nothing would make them happier; it's just the kind of conflict and drama that makes them feel most desired.
A Grown woman is not impressed with being desired by others—she expects it, based on their respect and love of herself. They know they have a lot to offer, and therefore sets a high standard for those who would prove worthy of their time and company, not to mention access to their heart, body, money and home. A Grown woman does not need the attention of others to feel desirable or worthy of love. And they know the difference between being desired and wanted for what they look like, what they have or what they can do, and being loved and valued for who they are.
3. They feel incomplete and/or inadequate when she's not in a relationship—any relationship. This is the woman who believes “half a man” is better than no man, and that they are “less than” when they are alone. She'll endure mistreatment and disrespect, including infidelity, to keep a relationship, and quickly (before really getting to know a person) surrender sexually, emotionally and financially to get one. She'll also risk permanent consequences—including pregnancy—based on temporary feelings and circumstances. Unfortunately, they tend to attract men who are “penis-led” (men who lack self-discipline when it comes to managing their own sexual urges), who have neither the desire nor the capacity to engage in healthy, sustainable relationships. As a result, they are constantly in and out of “love,” including with men who are married or otherwise unavailable for long-term, honorable commitment. They often don't find out about their wife, baby momma and/or kids until they have already sexually and emotionally committed to him. Or worse, they don't care.
A Grown woman is a healthy, whole, and content person, who chooses life alone over anything less than loving, loyal and respectful treatment in a relationship with another person. They set a high standard based on self-love, and won't consider anyone who does not rise to it. That includes not allowing anyone to hold their past against them (including choices they made before they were Grown) or try to make them feel unworthy of choosing better for their life. In the meantime, they are focused on their own growth and personal development, not dictated to by a biological clock nor passing months on the calendar. As a result, they feel no pressure to surrender access to their heart, body, money or home before potential relationship partners have proven their capacity to care for them A Grown woman believes that a relationship partner who recognizes their true value, and honors, esteems and respects them accordingly, is worth waiting for. By the way, the lack of drama, complications and “placeholders” in their life makes it easier for potentially worthy relationship partners to find and appreciate them In the meantime, they are happy, whole and fully committed to meeting their own needs and pursuing personal growth.
Any woman who exhibits any one of the above characteristics is not ready for a healthy relationship, regardless of how God-fearing, fine, sexy or successful they are—or how badly you want them And if they demonstrate two or more of these characteristics, you will regret inviting them into your life, your home or your bed. Do not try to “love” away their pain, make-up for the men that hurt them in the past, or otherwise rescue them Don't let her—or your ego—convince you that all that they need is a good man like you. Grown women don't need to be rescued. They are waiting for a partner, not looking for a savior.
In the meantime, as you prepare to prove worthy of their time and attention, we invite you to Live in the Grown Zone!

HBO Programming President Michael Lombardo defended the second season of “True Detective” in light of critical second-guessing, and expressed support for the network's hit “Game of Thrones” regarding scenes of sexual violence that have provoked criticism.
Lombardo, in what they billed Thursday as their first solo outing at the TV Critics Assn. tour without network chief Richard Plepler, seemed well-prepared for both questions, given some of the complaining, most recently, about “Detective's” current run.
The executive joked that they had returned from vacation to learn that some critics had voiced their displeasure with “True Detective,” but they gave a vote of confidence to writer/showrunner Nic Pizzolatto and said they would be eager to hear their plans for a third season. “I think they take a big swing,” Lombardo said, adding that they have seen the final episodes and “I'm enormously proud of it. … I think he's a spectacular writer.”
Asked about seeking changes if the show did proceed, Lombardo said they had no interest in “micro-managing the process.” The executive added of Pizzolatto, “I would happily be in business with them for a long time.”

As for “Game of Thrones,” Lombardo said the program's producers are extremely sensitive about the content of the show, but that the ground rules of a violent, mythical world have been established since the very first episode, when a young boy was pushed off a tower. “Everybody has their own line,” they acknowledged.
Regarding the future of “Game of Thrones,” which has already been renewed through an upcoming sixth season, Lombardo said they were hoping the producers would agree to at least two more, but that the parties have yet to engage in those conversations.
HBO opened the executive session with footage from two eagerly anticipated upcoming dramas, set to premiere next year: an adaptation of “Westworld,” and the reunion of “Boardwalk Empire's” Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter, joined by Mick Jagger, on the 1970s musical drama “Vinyl.” Lombardo said that a new series featuring “Sex and the City's” Sarah Jessica Parker would likely premiere next spring or summer, and that they haven't given up hope on additional seasons of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” recognizing that creator Larry David works on their own timetable.
Lombardo admitted that they are “not a fantasy guy,” given HBO's reliance on such fare, but added that the 20 million people watching an average episode of “Game of Thrones” aren't all committed genre fans. Asked if the character of Jon Snow is dead — the subject of speculation since the season finale — Lombardo said, “Yes.  They are indeed dead.”
Hello guys and girls!
The second part of our Q&A is about: COUNTERS.
First, let's start with a distinction between Counter and Backup, with both definitions.
10.5.1. Backup is a keyword and an activated ability that can occur and played from hand when there is a character being attacked, during the counter step of the opponent's attack sub phase.
Counter – Attack icon ( ) be indicated, this card can then be used during the counter step of the opponent's turn. 2.8.2. Should a– Attack icon () be indicated, this card can then be used during the counter step of the opponent's turn. 2.8.2.1. Unless otherwise stated, it is possible to play a card with a counter – attack icon during your own turn during your main phase.
1.
Question: I don't have green in my clock and neither in my level, may I play a green backup card from my hand?
Answer: Yes.
Explanation: As you can see, these backup abilities have a cost of discarding the card from your hand to give the respective power to your defending character. You're not playing the card, you're using it's ability from your hand, so you don't need the color requirement.
2.
Question: What if the card is a yellow counter event may I play it if I don't have yellow in my clock or level?
Answer: No!
Explanation: As you can see, this is a counter, but this is not a backup. To use it you must effectively play it from your hand, necessitating color requirement. It goes to the resolution zone (more about resolution zone in a future article) and when it's resolved it then goes to the waiting room.
3.
Question: I have a card like this that says “During this card's battle, all players cannot play ‘Backup' from hand“, may I play an event counter in this card battle?
Answer: Yes.
Explanation: It says you cannot play “Backup”. As you can see the event counters do not have the ability “Backup”.
4.
Question: And with cards like “Machine of Ice” Sinon, can I play counters?
Answer: No.
Explanation: This one says “ During this card's battle, you cannot play event cards and “Backup” from your hand “. You must read carefully to check if the card disallows both events and backups or just backups!
5.
Question: May I play a counter event in my main phase?
Answer: Unless otherwise stated in the card, yes!
Explanation:
attack icon during your own turn during your main phase. 2.8.2.1. Unless otherwise stated, it is possible to play a card with a counterattack icon during your own turn during your main phase.
Do not forget that with “backups” it's a different story: they are played when one of your characters is being frontal attacked.
6. Anti-Change!
Question: If my attacking character goes to the waiting room/or to the bottom of the deck with an effect of an anti-change backup, will my opponent still take damage from my attack?
Answer: No.
Explanation:
7.5.1.2.2. If the attacking character had left the stage, or if the master of the attacking character changed, or if the attacking character moved to another stage position, then the attacking character does not deal damage.
Note that if the anti-change has sent your attacking character to the waiting room you may encore it when it hits the waiting room. If you choose to encore it, the attacking character has left the stage anyway, so it comes back to the stage (rested), but it's not the attacking character anymore: so no damage anyway!
7. Anti-Change!
Question: What if I encore my attacking character? Do the characters compare power with each other?
Answer: No.
7.6.1.3. If the attacking character or the attacked character has left the stage,or if the master of the attacking character or attacked character changed, or if the attacking character or attacked character moved to another stage position, then the attacking character or the attacked character does not compare power, and neither character cards change their state.
8.
Question: What happens if I use an event counter on my defending character to return it to my hand when I'm being frontal attacked. Will the attack be direct? Will I still take damage?
Answer: The attack is still a frontal attack and you take damage as usual.
Explanation:
7.2.1.4.3. After the type of attack is chosen, even if the position of the card facing the chosen card to attack is changed, there will be no increase or decrease in the soul due to the type of attack. For example, a side attack is declared for the chosen card to attack, but due to certain reasons, the character card facing the chosen card to attack is returned to the owner's hand. The attack remains as a side attack, and the soul remains unchanged
9.
Question: What does “choose one of your yellow characters in battle” or ” choose one of your green characters in battle” mean in backups. May I choose any of my characters of that color or just the one being frontal attacked?
Answer: You may choose only the one being frontal attacked at the moment and it needs to have the right color.
Explanation:
If a frontal attack is chosen, the character card facing the attacking character, becomes the attacked character during this attack sub phase, and becomes a character “that is being frontal attacked”. Both the attacking character and the attacked character are called “battling characters”, and are character cards “in battle”.
10.
Question: What if it doesn't say “in battle”? I can choose another of my characters, right?
Answer: Right!
Explanation: The only requirements here are the traits and the number of characters, but you can surprise your opponent giving +1000 to the character being frontal attacked and +1000 to another one, for example one that was not attacked this turn yet. Or you can give +2000 to the one being frontal attacked.
11.
Question: If I use a Kancolle Compass do I take damage from a second attack of a restander or a shot on reverse effect?
Answer: No.
Explanation: You do not take any damage from the character that is frontal attacking you for the rest of the turn, some examples of cards that get damage from their abilities prevented:
You can restand Levi but they still don't deal damage.
Even though you reverse a character with Mikasa no damage is dealt.
Compass doesn't work that well with characters that deal damage before the Counter step, like Sinon or Marika : You don't take the damage from the attack in the damage step but as the abilities deal damage before the counter step that damage is not prevented. It doesn't prevent clock kick either, 'cause it's not damage being dealt.
12.
Question: If I use a Sayaka Wish/Love Wing Bell on a Sayaka/Rin defending from an attack of a clock kicker does the character still get sent to clock?
Answer: No.
Explanation: No, 'cause you're not reversing the character: It goes to the waiting room in the counter step if you paid the cost of these counters with the attacked character. Don't forget: even if you encore the Sayaka/Rin, they aren't sent to clock 'cause it isn't the defending character anymore.
13.
Question: What if I play a Anti-Titan Device counter to move my character to another position, do I avoid clock kicks too?
Answer: Yes!
Explanation: As long as you move the character, there isn't a defending character to clock kick anymore!
14. Reshuffle backups!
Question: If I play a reshuffle backup and pay for the reshuffle ability the is the backup reshuffled too or does it go to the waiting room?
Answer: It is reshuffled with the rest of the deck.
Explanation: The cost to play the backup includes putting it into the waiting room. So, when you choose to do the reshuffle ability it's already in the waiting room and returns to the deck with the rest of the cards.
15. Reshuffle backups!
Question: What if it's an event counter that reshuffles, it is reshuffled too?
Answer: By now, you probably know the answer. 😛
No. As an event stays on the resolution zone until all of the effect is resolved, it's not reshuffled.
Explanation:
8.6.2.4.2. If you played an event card, put that card to the resolution zone , process the effect, and put the event card to the owner's waiting room after it resolves.
I believe this covers almost all types of backups and counters existing at the moment in the English game that could raise some doubts, and it also gives you a general idea of how they work.
Hope you like it!

The Detroit Red Wings took 5-foot-11, 183-pound left wing Teemu Pulkkinen from Finland with their fourth-round pick (111th overall) in Saturday's NHL entry draft at Staples Center in Los Angeles.
They played for Jokerit of the Finnish League last season. Some projected Pulkkinen to be selected in the first or second round.
They were rated as the No. 46 prospect by TSN and No. 50 by The Hockey News.
Pulkkinen came into the season with a lot of hype but suffered wrist and ankle injuries and missed a good chunk of the season. They returned for the under 18 team and put up big numbers (20 goals, 21 assists in 17 games).
McKeen's draft guide said of Pulkkinen: "Although undersized, Pulkkinen is an absolute tyrant in the offensive zone. They have sensational hand skills and passing ability and on the power-play they could be one of the most offensively gifted
players available for the draft. Their skating sets them back as they do not have a separation gear and possesses only modest speed. Defensively, their game has come under some criticism as they do not always mark their man or drop below the blue line.''
A series of hard hits at Mount Panorama's infamous Dipper has seen a new tyre barrier installed ahead of the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.
Two rows of tyres, covered by a rubber belt, now sit in front of the concrete wall on the outside of the left-hander to cushion cars in front-on impacts.
Last year's Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 and February's Bathurst 12 Hour included big crashes at The Dipper that, while drivers walked away from, ended with their cars being written off.
Jack Smith's rookie Dunlop Super2 appearance ended with a heavy hit on the concrete last October in a Paul Morris Motorsport Ford, while a Hobson Motorsport Nissan GT-R met a sad end against the same wall five months later.
Tim Schenken, who is the vice-president of the FIA's Circuits Commission as well as being Supercars' Race Director, says the change is part of the constant evaluation of how safety can be improved at all circuits on the calendar.
“We've had a number of incidents with cars coming over Skyline and hitting the wall on the left-hand-side before the Dipper,” Schenken told Supercars.com.
“The cars then go directly across the road into the right-side concrete wall at 90 degrees, where we've now installed the tyre barrier.
“Having the tyres there will take a lot of the energy out of that secondary impact.
“It has made the road slightly narrower, but seeing that the race line is hard on the left, we don't think that will be an issue.”
Supercars teams and drivers will undertake track walks at Mount Panorama tomorrow ahead of opening practice on Thursday.
A Royal Peculiar (or Royal Peculier ) is a Church of England parish or church exempt from the jurisdiction of the diocese and the archdiocese in which it lies and subject to the direct jurisdiction of the monarch.
A "peculiar" is applied to those ecclesiastical districts, parishes, chapels or churches that are outside the jurisdiction of the bishop and archdeacon of the diocese in which they are situated. They include the separate or "peculiar" jurisdiction of the monarch, another archbishop, bishop or the dean and chapter of a cathedral (also, the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller). An Archbishop's Peculiar is subject to the direct jurisdiction of an archbishop and a Royal Peculiar is subject to the direct jurisdiction of the monarch.[2]
The concept dates from Anglo-Saxon times, when a church could ally itself with the monarch and thereby not be subject to the bishop of the area. Later, it reflected the relationship between the Norman and Plantagenet kings and the English Church. Most peculiars survived the Reformation but, with the exception of Royal Peculiars, were finally abolished during the 19th century by various Acts of Parliament and became subject to the jurisdiction of the diocese in which they were, although a few non-royal peculiars still exist.[2] The majority of Royal Peculiars that remain are situated within the Diocese of London.[3]
There are no less than 18 colors available in the online configurator on Audi Deutschland's site for the RS5 Coupe and one of them is called “Sonomagrün Metallic.” Available for €890 (about $1,000), it's actually one of the most affordable shades you can have as some of them cost as much as €2,400 ($2,700), including a few that come with an eye-catching pearlescent finish.
Available exclusively on the new RS5 Coupe, the green nuance looks surprisingly nice on Ingolstadt's new high-performance coupe and it is combined with numerous glossy black bits as part of the optional black visual pack priced at €550 ($611). While a standard RS5 comes with 19-inch alloy wheels, this one has been upgraded to a 20-inch set featuring a five-spoke trapezoidal design and available for a hefty €2,000 ($2,230).
The list of upgrades doesn't end here as this particular car also has the RS sport exhaust system priced at €1,200 ($1,333) and an assortment of cabin upgrades, including the fancy stitching on the sports seats featuring a honeycomb pattern. Cars that are being exhibited at the Audi Forum Ingolstadt in Germany usually come with most of the bells and whistles, and that seems to be the case here as well.
Should the Sonomagrün Metallic not tickle your fancy, there is always the option to spend more on many of the available individual colors as Audi will let you pick whatever shade you can think of in exchange for a cool €2,400 ($2,700).
We're wondering where the name of this green paint comes from — perhaps Sonoma as in Sonoma County in California? Audi did test the RS7 Piloted Driving concept at the Sonoma Raceway a couple of years ago, so that might be it, unless it's an odd tribute to Chevy S-10's sister model GMC S-15 / Sonoma…

VALDOSTA, Ga. - Hours before the polls open in Georgia and 10 other states, the Republican frontrunner made a final pitch to voters Valdosta, Georgia.
A large crowd gathered for a rally Monday evening at the athletic complex at Valdosta State University. The building seats more than 5,000 but has more room on the floor and elsewhere. There was standing room only at the event.
During the rally, Trump's campaign announced the following endorsements: NASCAR CEO Brian France, retired driver Bill Elliott and active drivers Chase Elliott, Ryan Newman and David Lee Regan.
“I am proud to receive the endorsement of such an iconic brand and a quality person such as Brian," said Trump. "Brian has a wonderful family and is an incredibly successful business person. I have great respect for Brian and I am grateful for their support and that of Bill Elliott, one of the best drivers in history, and active stock car racers, including their son Chase Elliott, Ryan Newman and David Lee Regan.”
France said Trump is changing American politics forever and their leadership and strength are desperately needed.
"He has had an incredible career and achieved tremendous success. This is what we need for our country,” said France.
Trump is the first presidential candidate in the south Georgia town since Ronald Reagan visited in 1980.
The crowd was filled with supporters like small business owner Brad Mathis. "We're hoping Donald Trump gets in there, we're here to support him. We're very interested and curious about what they have to say," said Mathis.
Kent Justice spoke with a first-time voter named Amanda following the event. They said, "As a Republican, voting tomorrow for the first time, I was actually very interested in what Mr. Trump had to say. Originally I came to see the 'spectacle,' yet I actually agreed with many of their points. Their business person personality and confidence really do help their claims.  They are someone I will keep in mind when I cast my vote tomorrow," Amanda said.
Trump's appearance comes as a sharp new divide erupted between Republicans who pledge to fall in line behind Trump if they win their party's nomination and others who insist they can never back the bombastic billionaire.
The fissure could have major implications beyond the primaries, exposing the looming challenges in uniting the party after the election, no matter who wins.
Nebraska's Ben Sasse, a rising star among conservatives, became the first current senator to publicly raise the prospect of backing a third party option if Trump clinches the nomination. In a letter posted on Facebook late Sunday, Sasse urged Republicans to consider whether a party led by Trump would still represent their interests.
"If our party is no longer working for the things we believe in - like defending the sanctity of life, stopping Obamacare, protecting the Second Amendment, etc. - then people of good conscience should stop supporting that party until it is reformed," they wrote.
Other Republican leaders were less explicit, but sent similar messages on Monday, particularly in light of Trump's refusal to immediately disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's support.
Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee, called that "disqualifying." And South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, campaigning in Atlanta alongside Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said they would "not stop fighting a man who refuses to disavow the KKK."
Trump said they had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and they did later repudiate him. "How many times do I have to continue to disavow people?" they said.
Several high-profile Republicans and conservative writers have embraced an anti-Trump social media campaign, using the Twitter hashtag "NeverTrump."
Trump has won three of four early primary contests, roiling a party that had assumed their populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's only grown stronger and appears to be in commanding position heading into Super Tuesday, the biggest single-day delegate haul of the year.
The Associated Press asked Republican senators and governors across the country if they would back Trump if they secured the nomination. Just under half of those who responded would not commit to backing him, foreshadowing a potentially extraordinary break this fall.
"I am increasingly concerned by Donald Trump's statements and behavior, and I have serious concerns about their ability to win the general election and provide presidential leadership," Indiana Sen. Dan Coats said in a statement to AP.
Tensions boiled over during Trump's rally Monday in Radford, Virginia, where they were repeatedly disrupted by demonstrators, including 20 or more chanting "Black lives matter." At another point, they asked a protester, "Are you from Mexico?" after they were interrupted during remarks about immigration. They ordered several people to be removed, then cast themselves as a unifying political force.
"Believe it or not, we're going to unify this country," they said.
If Trump sweeps most of the states up for grabs Tuesday, they could amass a delegate lead that would be difficult for any rival to overcome. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is banking on a win in their home state to keep them in the race, while Rubio wants to stay close in the delegate count until the primary hits their home state of Florida on March 15.
Meanwhile, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is solidifying their lead. Like Trump, Clinton could begin putting their party's nomination out of reach for rival Bernie Sanders with a strong showing on Super Tuesday.
As Trump has rolled through the early voting states, he's received enthusiastic endorsements from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of the most vocal opponents of immigration -law changes on Capitol Hill. Several other party officials have said they would back the real estate mogul if they do become the nominee, though some say their support would be reluctant.
"I'm a Republican and I will support the nominee," Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said Monday. "I do not think they are our best nominee, but I will support the nominee."
Party leaders are particularly worried about the ripple effect of a Trump nomination on other races. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged Republicans to remember that their White House pick also impacts "the Senate and whether we're going to continue to elect Republican governors across the country."
A new commercial released Monday by Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, who is challenging John McCain for their Senate seat, served as a likely preview of how Democrats would seek to link GOP candidates to Trump. The 60-second spot highlighted several of Trump's more incendiary statements and questioned how McCain could say they would support them in the general election.
Some Republicans said Senate candidates and others would have to forgo party unity in order to save themselves.
"It's not going to be a team effort. It's going to be every man for himself," said Matt Mackowiak, a GOP strategist who is unaffiliated in the 2016 race.
Research has shown that New Zealand blackcurrants are good for keeping us mentally young and agile, a finding that could have potential in managing the mental decline associated with aging populations, or helping people with brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease or depression.
The research, conducted by scientists at Plant & Food Research (New Zealand) in collaboration with Northumbria University (UK), showed that compounds found in New Zealand blackcurrants increased mental performance indicators, such as accuracy, attention and mood. The study also showed that juice from a specific New Zealand blackcurrant cultivar, 'Blackadder', also reduced the activity of a family of enzymes called monoamine oxidases, which regulate serotonin and dopamine concentrations in the brain. These chemicals are known to affect mood and cognition, and are the focus for treatments of both neurodegenerative symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease and mood disorders, including stress and anxiety.
Results of the research have been published online in the Journal of Functional Foods, a leading journal in the field.
"This study is the first to look at the effects of berry consumption on the cognitive performance of healthy young adults," says Dr. Arjan Scheepens, the Plant & Food Research scientist who led the study. "Our previous research has suggested that compounds found in certain berryfruit may act like monoamine oxidase inhibitors, similar to a class of pharmaceuticals commonly used in the treatment of both mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. This research has shown that New Zealand-grown blackcurrants not only increase mental performance, but also reduce the activity of monoamine oxidases."
"One of the key trends in the food industry is the development of ingredients and foods that have beneficial effects on human health," says professor Roger Hurst, Science Group Leader Food & Wellness at Plant & Food Research. "Understanding what, and how, foods affect mental performance could lead to the development of new foods designed for populations or situations where mental performance or mental decline is a factor, such as older people or those suffering from stress, anxiety or other mood disorders. This research shows how New Zealand blackcurrants can potentially add value, both for the food industry and for people looking for foods that naturally support their own health aspirations."
Participants in the study -- 36 healthy adults aged between 18 and 35 years -- consumed a 250ml drink prior to conducting a set of demanding mental performance assessments. The participants consumed either a sugar and taste-matched placebo (no blackcurrant), an anthocyanin-enriched New Zealand blackcurrant extract (Delcyan™ from Just the Berries) or a cold-pressed juice from the New Zealand blackcurrant cultivar 'Blackadder', bred by Plant & Food Research. The assessments showed that after consuming the Delcyan™ and 'Blackadder' drinks, attention and mood were improved while mental fatigue was reduced. In addition, blood tests showed that the activity of the monoamine oxidase enzymes (MAO) was strongly decreased after consuming the 'Blackadder' juice, indicating the potential for compounds found in 'Blackadder' blackcurrants as a functional food ingredient to support brain health or managing the symptoms of disorders like Parkinson's disease.

Many would argue that the original "Star Wars" films were masterpieces when they were first released (the prequels not so much). However George Lucas just can't stop futzing around with their creations.
The billionaire filmmaker's latest change can be seen in the upcoming Blu-ray release of the original trilogy. In the battle between Luke Skywalker and the Emperor in "Return of the Jedi," Lucas has given Darth Vader a new bit of dialogue.
Originally, Darth Vader just stood and watched the Emperor electrocute Luke with lightning bolts before coming to their son's rescue. Not anymore. Now, right before Darth Vader comes out of their daze, lifts up the Emperor, and tosses them to their death, the Dark Lord of the Sith yells a helpless "Noooo!"
If you're having having flashbacks to the awkward moment in "Revenge of the Sith" when the newly created Darth Vader screams "Noooo!" after the Emperor lies to them about Padme's death (awesome parody here), you're not alone. "Star Wars" fans far and wide have voiced their displeasure. Among the disappointed is filmmaker Simon Pegg, who wrote on Twitter that they "always loved Vader's wordless self sacrifice." Pegg then goes on to use salty language to bring home their point.
Commenters at Entertainment Weekly are equally displeased. One person writes, "WHY? WHY? WHY? Mr Lucas — do you have sooo much time on your hands that all you want to do is to simply keep tinkering with the movies? Leave them alone and go fishing!" Another jokingly posts, "Oh, now I get it. Vader threw the Emperor down the shaft because they were saying "NOOOOO…." to what the Emperor was doing to their kid. And here I always thought it was just a big ol' bear hug that went wrong..."
Still, for all the outrage, Lucas has been unapologetic about their desire to alter their movies, probably because they truly believe he's improving them. In the past, he's made Han Solo shoot Greedo first, added Hayden Christensen to the end of "Return of the Jedi," and given Jabba the Hutt an ill-advised cameo in "A New Hope." None of thoes changes have gone over well with the fans who have made them a billionaire. Perhaps one day he'll digitally remove Jar Jar Binks from "The Phantom Menace." Would anyone complain about that? Anyone?

INMAN, SC (WSPA) -- A son has confessed to killing their parents after they were found with multiple gunshot wounds, according to Spartanburg County deputies.
The shooting victims have been identified as Henrietta Green Belcher, 60, and William Edward Belcher, 69.
Deputies responded to a welfare check around midnight Tuesday on Bentwood Drive after the victims' daughter-in-law called 911.

Deputies say the couple's son, Stephen Linwood Belcher, met them outside the home and told deputies that both victims were dead in a room upstairs.
It appeared that both victims had been dead for an extended period of time.
Deputies say the couple was shot on Nov. 5.
Investigators say Belcher confessed to killing both parents.
The 39-year-old Boiling Springs man has been charged with two counts of murder and possession of a weapon during a violent crime.
Deputies are investigating a possible motive.
An autopsy is being performed to determine the cause of death, but both victims have gunshot wounds, according to the coroner's office.
A magistrate judge denied bond for Belcher on Tuesday.
POLITICAL REACTION:OPPOSITION PARTIES have pledged to alter the Government's four-year austerity plan if there is a change of administration after the election.
Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Féin separately said yesterday that they would not be bound by the commitments outlined in the documents to reduce the deficit by €15 billion by 2014 and would seek to renegotiate elements of it.
All three parties have singled out for particular criticism the proposal to cut the national minimum wage from €8.65 to €7.65.
Taoiseach Brian Cowen defended the plan yesterday saying the substantial adjustments, including €6 billion in the first year, would bring certainty and stability to the country.
“What has been set out here is a realistic appraisal of what is possible, what is necessary and what is do-able,” they said.
“If people want to say that there are changes that they want to make, [they must] make sure they add up, and make sure that it doesn't create more uncertainty at a time when this country critically needs some certainty.”
Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan also said they were confident of gaining sufficient Dáil support to pass the budget on December 7th.
“I am quite satisfied from my discussions both with the parties in Government and the various public representatives in Dáil Éireann that there is a majority for the budget and that it will pass,” they said at an event organised by American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.
Their comments suggested the Government has secured the backing of at least one of the Independents. Michael Lowry insisted yesterday that they were “unlikely” to support the budget but did not definitively rule out the prospect.
Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny contended that the Government had led the country to an “economic abyss”.
Dáil business was suspended to allow for statements from the Government and Opposition leaders on the plan.
Labour leader Eamon Gilmore later denied they have changed their position in the past fortnight on reversing decisions in the upcoming budget.
When appearing on the Late Late Show earlier this month, they said they would not reverse budgetary cuts. However, in an interview on RTÉ's News at One yesterday, they said that Labour in government would examine budget decisions that were “blatantly unfair” on a case-by-case basis.
Challenged by presenter Seán O'Rourke that they were changing their story and their comments on the Late Late Show were now “inoperative”, Mr Gilmore said they were not changing their story and that O'Rourke was playing word games.
O'Rourke responded: “It's trying to do what people have been doing for a long time is to pin you [and] your colleagues down on where you stand in regard to measures that have to be taken.
“It seems that you are hunker-sliding now from the position you adopted on the Late Late Show?”
Mr Gilmore replied that Labour would not reverse all cuts but was willing to reverse specific cuts.
Fine Gael's Richard Bruton and Labour's Joan Burton said yesterday they would reverse the cut of €1 proposed in the minimum wage.
Mr Bruton said Fine Gael would be prepared to make senior bondholders in banks take some of the hit for large losses at the lenders.
President Donald Trump has fired FBI Director James Comey.
"I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation," Mr. Trump said in a letter to Comey released Tuesday. "I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately."
FULL COVERAGE: Firing of FBI Director James Comey
Why Trump fired Comey -- and who might replace them
"While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau," the president continued. "It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors."
The dismissal comes as the FBI is investigating any Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and any Russian ties to Mr. Trump associates. Comey had most recently come under fire for misstating how many sensitive emails Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, forwarded to their husband, Anthony Weiner.
Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe will become acting FBI director while the search for a new director begins, according to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Comey was meeting with agents and staff at the FBI complex in Los Angeles when they were fired. They were scheduled to speak tonight at a recruiting event for the FBI. Mr. Trump's longtime body man, Keith Schiller, dropped off the letters notifying Comey of their firing by hand this afternoon at the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., a White House official confirmed. Comey boarded a plane a little before 9 p.m. ET presumably destined for the East Coast.
Letter from President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey
McCabe was called to a meeting at 5:30 p.m. and appointed acting director 15 minutes before the White House announced Comey's firing at 5:45 p.m. U.S. officials told CBS News that McCabe hastily arranged a video conference with the FBI's 56 field offices, held at about 8 p.m.
Why was James Comey fired?
The White House released several documents after Comey's firing, including the letter Mr. Trump informing Comey of their termination, the memo from Sessions recommending Comey's dismissal to the president, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's memo to Sessions on Comey.
"The Director of the FBI must be someone who follows faithfully the rules and principles of the Department of Justice and who sets the right example for our law enforcement officials and others in the Department," Sessions wrote to the president. "Therefore, I must recommend that you remove Director James B. Comey, Jr., and identify an experienced and qualified individual to lead the great men and women of the FBI.
It was the strongly worded memo written by Rosenstein to Sessions that outlined Comey's missteps and laid out the argument for their removal.
"The current FBI Director is an articulate and persuasive speaker about leadership and the immutable principles of the Department of Justice," Rosenstein wrote. "He deserves our appreciation for their public service. As you and I have discussed, however, I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand their refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that they were mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives."
White House: Comey "politicized' the role of FBI Director, leading to firing
Rosenstein continued to expand their case for Comey's removal, adding a succession of bad decisions on Comey's part in handling the Clinton email case so publicly.
"The director was wrong to usurp the attorney general's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce their conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution," Rosenstein continued. "It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors. The director now defends their decision by asserting that they believed Attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict. But the FBI director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department."
Rosenstein also included opinions from multiple former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general baffled at Comey for discussing the Clinton email case without any indictments.
James Comey's firing: A timeline
"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong," Rosenstein wrote. "As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit their errors, the director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions."
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the search for a new FBI director will begin immediately.
"The FBI is one of our nation's most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement," Spicer said in a statement.

Linus Torvalds, the inventor of the Linux kernel, has an absolute disdain for mobile phones. All of the ones they have purchased in the past, the man writes on their personal blog, ended up being “mostly used for playing Galaga and Solitaire on long flights” even though they were naturally all phones run on open source operating systems.
Things have changed now, they add, now that they have caved and bought Google's Nexus One a couple of days ago.
Torvalds has owned a number of phones before, including Google's G1 device and ‘one of the early China-only Motorola Linux phones', but it took for Google to add multi-touch capabilities to the Nexus One before they finally broke down and bought one from the company's web store.
And he's loving it:
But I have to admit, the Nexus One is a winner. I wasn't enthusiastic about buying a phone on the internet sight unseen, but the day it was reported that it finally had the pinch-to-zoom thing enabled, I decided to take the plunge. I've wanted to have a GPS unit for my car anyway, and I thought that Google navigation might finally make a phone useful. And it does. What a difference! I no longer feel like I'm dragging a phone with me “just in case” I would need to get in touch with somebody – now I'm having a useful (and admittedly pretty good-looking) gadget instead. The fact that you can use it as a phone too is kind of secondary.
While Google hasn't disclosed how many phones it's sold so far, the company is believed to have sold closer to 100,000 than 1 million devices. But at least one of them made one of the most famous software engineers in the world one happy camper.
Life Is Strange publisher Square Enix launched an anti-bullying charity campaign themed around the episodic adventure game this week, promising to donate an unspecified amount to PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center every time someone takes part in the event.
While it's not uncommon for large companies to make a show of drumming up money and support for noble causes, this instance is especially notable because it shows Square Enix is continuing to back Dontnod's efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of bullying.
The French studio went so far as to include a message at the end of Life Is Strange episodes encouraging players who felt affected by the game -- which prominently features young people wrestling with social issues like bullying, harassment and suicidal behavior -- to visit a special page on the game's website dedicated to sharing crisis hotline information for countries around the world.
Square Enix also streamed a live playthrough of the game for charity in November as part of the annual Extra Life event, which calls on people around the world to raise money for children's hospitals while livestreaming themselves playing games.
Voters who have relied on the network evening newscasts for information about the 2016 presidential candidates saw four times more airtime devoted to controversies involving presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump than to the scandals surrounding their Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
Indeed, the only Clinton scandal to receive more than a minimal amount of attention from the networks during the primaries was the ongoing investigation of Clinton's use of a private e-mail server and their mishandling of classified information while serving as Secretary of State. The networks paid little or no attention to a host of other Clinton controversies that likely would have been big news if they had been associated with their GOP opponent.
MRC analysts reviewed all 1,099 stories on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts which talked about the presidential campaign between January 1 through June 7, including weekends. This tally includes 950 full reports and interview segments; 66 short items read by the anchor; plus 83 stories on other topics that included some discussion of one or more of the candidates.
The overall amount of campaign airtime is extraordinary: 2,137 minutes of coverage, or more than one-fourth (26.1%) of all evening news airtime during this period, excluding commercials and teases.
Nearly half of that airtime (1,068 minutes) was spent talking about Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, compared to 583 minutes of coverage for Hillary Clinton. Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders, came in third, with 366 minutes of coverage, more than any of Trump's GOP rivals.
Compared to Clinton, a much higher percentage of Trump's airtime (40 percent, or 432 minutes) was spent discussing the controversies surrounding the Republican's candidacy. Only 18 percent of Clinton's coverage (105 minutes) was spent discussing similar controversies, as network reporters paid scant attention to stories that would have garnered far more airtime had Trump been involved.
For example, the lingering questions about Clinton's handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack drew only 77 seconds of evening news airtime from January 1 through June 7. Clinton's participation in a racially-charged comedy skit with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (about running on CP time — “cautious politician time”) was skipped by ABC and NBC's evening broadcasts, getting just 51 seconds of airtime on the April 12 edition of the CBS Evening News.
The potential conflict-of-interest scandal surrounding the Clinton Foundation and Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State was given a paltry 44 seconds of coverage — half of which came when their socialist rival Bernie Sanders brought it up during the waning days of the Democratic primaries.
“Do I have a problem when a sitting Secretary of State and a foundation run by their husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments?” Sanders asked in a soundbite re-played on the June 6 Nightly News. “Do I have a problem with that? Yeah, I do.”
Neither ABC nor CBS mentioned Sanders complaint that night, nor did any follow up in the days that followed.
Clinton's e-mail server scandal was the most-covered candidate controversy of the primary season, with more than 47 minutes of airtime. The only other Clinton controversy to crack the Top 20 was discussion of Bill Clinton's past adultery and alleged mistreatment of women — a topic only covered because it was brought up by Trump.
And, most of the network coverage was framed not around the controversy of Clinton's actual conduct, but the notion that Trump was going too far by raising the issue of the former President's infidelity. On the May 19 Evening News, for example, CBS's Nancy Cordes labeled it “harsh” of Trump to bring up the case of Juanita Broaddrick, who in 1999 accused Clinton of raping them in 1978. That same night, ABC's David Muir said Trump was “proving nothing is off limits,” while NBC's Andrea Mitchell accused Trump of engaging in “aggressive personal attacks.”
The other 18 controversies on the Top 20 list were all related to the GOP candidate: violence at some of Trump's rallies (31 minutes); their racially-charged criticism of the judge in the Trump University fraud case (27 minutes); their history of liberal policy positions and shift to the left on some issues after their last GOP rival dropped out of the race (24 minutes); and history of sexist rhetoric and charges of crude behavior with women (22 minutes).
These are obviously valid topics for news coverage, but contrast the amount of network airtime Trump's problems received with the same statistics for key controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton: their big money speeches to Wall Street banks, and their refusal to release transcripts of those speeches (7 minutes, 35 seconds); and their reliance on massive campaign contributions from the wealthy (6 minutes, 50 seconds).
When cameras caught Clinton angrily yelling at a Sanders supporter over the issue of contributions from those in the fossil fuel industry (“I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me!”) the flap drew just 72 seconds of coverage on the NBC Nightly News, 40 seconds of coverage on ABC's World News Tonight, and a mere 16 seconds on the CBS Evening News.
When in May Clinton suggested on a radio show that they believed in space aliens (“There are enough stories out there that I don't think everybody is just sitting, you know, in their kitchen making them up”), only ABC's World News Tonight bothered to tell viewers, with a light-hearted one minute, 43 second stories on a Sunday night broadcast.
“Clinton's enthusiasm is winning over one part of the electorate,” ABC correspondent David Wright wryly noted. “‘Finally,' tweeted one sci-fi fan, ‘she has my vote!'”
If Donald Trump had suggested little green men had visited Earth, their comments likely would have been highlighted as evidence that the Republican candidate is unsuitable for the presidency.
The networks have left no stone unturned in their vetting of Trump. But this is a race between two candidates, and they have an equal obligation to report on the scandals, controversies and gaffes surrounding Hillary Clinton.
Snap reported its earnings for the first time since becoming a public company in March of this year. Its daily active user count clicked up to 166 million, a 5 percent increase over last quarter, up 36 percent from this time a year ago. That puts it behind Instagram Stories, a competitor launched by Facebook that copied heavily from Snapchat and has already passed 200 million users. It also means Snap hasn't found a way back to the rapid growth it saw in years past.
Snapchat has a user growth problem on its hands
Investors were not pleased with the slowing rate of growth, and the company's shares were down nearly 25 percent in after-hours trading. Financially the company continued to increase its revenue, which grew nearly 300 percent to just under $150 million in the first quarter. Of that around $8 million came from sales of Spectacles, its one hardware product. But it's still a long way from achieving a profit, and even then that revenue figure came in under Wall Street expectations of $158 million.
The company's losses ballooned to over $2.2 billion, but most of those were one time expenses related to stock bonuses paid out after a successful IPO. CEO Evan Spiegel got a sweet $750 million on their own. But even if you ignore that massive hit, Snap's losses basically doubled. It burned through $104 million in cash in the first quarter of 2016, and lost $208 million during the first three months of 2017. This was despite the fact that the average revenue per user generated by Snap was 90 cents, up 14 percent from last quarter and up 181 percent from the same period last year.
Investors should have seen this coming. The company's financial disclosures before its IPO revealed large and growing losses. Snap warned investors that it was unsure when, if ever, it would reach profitability. And while its user base was highly engaged, its user growth slowed to its lowest level ever in the fourth quarter of last year.
Snapchat's pitch to investors: We have lost money, expect to lose more, and may never achieve profitability
https://t.co/HouOJvIFwh — Ben Popper (@benpopper) February 2, 2017
All the red flags that were present then continued to appear today, putting the company in the tough position. It will have to convince investors it can find ways to boost user growth or secure a path to profitability or its stock price will suffer the same fate as Twitter. That in turn can quickly make it difficult to attract and retain top talent.
Snap's big argument on its earnings call today was that the users it has, many of whom are teenagers, can't be reached by traditional television or print advertising. Notably absent from this pitch, however, was a comparison of advertising on Snapchat versus other social media. Snap said users spend an average of 30 minutes a day in the app, and that the number of ads being shown today is likely to increase, giving it headroom to boost revenue per user and move closer to profitability. It is also moving towards hosting original programming, showing short clips to users who are moving away from traditional television.
Asked if they were worried about competition from Facebook on the call, Spiegel let out an audible laugh. “Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google,” they quipped.
CARSON (CBSLA.com) — Authorities say a suspect who carjacked an 80-year-old woman at a shopping center in Carson Saturday morning is now behind bars.
The suspect carjacked the woman around 10 a.m. in the 20700 block of Avalon Boulevard.
Around 10 a.m. Carson Sheriff's received a call regarding a person breaking car windows in the parking lot of the shopping center.
When deputies arrived, they learned that the male suspect had just carjacked an 80-year-old woman. The deputies searched the area and located the suspect as they attempted to flee in the victim's stolen car. The suspect was immediately taken into custody.
Upon further investigation, deputies learned the suspect had also burglarized another vehicle in the area.
The victim was treated on scene and was in good condition, authorities said.
The suspect, identified as 35-year-old Jawwaad Garner, was arrested for carjacking and burglary.
Garner, described as a transient, was transported to the Carson Sheriff's Station where they were booked and being held on a $100, 000 bail.
Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call Detective John Dennis at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Carson Station, (310) 830-1123.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is known for their blunt talk -- on everything ranging from trade to immigration and the fight against ISIS. But throughout the 2016 campaign, and now in the White House, there's one topic that he's been less forthcoming about -- Russia's role interfering in the US election.
He's answered questions about attempts to hack the 2016 election many different ways throughout the campaign and since ascending to the presidency -- even speculating during a debate last year that it "could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."
The unanimous assessment of the US intelligence community is clear: Russia orchestrated a series of hacks and cyberattacks to meddle in the 2016 election and help Trump beat Hillary Clinton. Intelligence agencies have not concluded that Russian efforts made a difference in the election result.
Only once has Trump clearly pointed the finger at the Russian government, and as recently as Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer dodged reporters' questions on whether Trump holds that belief.
Here is a timeline of Trump's comments about Russian interference in the election:
June 15, 2016
The Trump campaign said the Democratic National Committee probably hacked itself as a distraction.
"We believe it was the DNC that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader," Trump said in a statement, Politico reported . "Too bad the DNC doesn't hack Crooked Hillary's, 33,000 missing emails."
September 8, 2016
Trump, in an interview with Larry King that aired on on the Kremlin-run RT , dismissed claims Russia hacked the DNC, and dismisses the notion that a Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 election is underway.
LARRY KING: Putin recently said that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails was a public service. You agree?
TRUMP: I don't have any opinion on it. I don't know anything about it. I don't know who hacked. I'm not sure who -- I mean, you tell me, who hacked? Who did the hacking? But I have absolutely no opinion on that. I don't know, I haven't heard that statement.
KING: US intelligence and law enforcement agencies reportedly are investigating whether Russia launched a covert operation to disrupt the 2016 election. What do you make of that?
TRUMP: I don't know. I've been hearing about it. I've been reading about it. I think it's probably unlikely. I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out, who knows? But I think that it's pretty unlikely, but you know, who knows? I hope that if they are doing something, I hope that somebody is going to be able to find out, so they can end it, because that would not be appropriate at all.

Trump dismissed allegations that Russia is behind the DNC hack during the first presidential debate.
"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said, we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China, but it could also be lots of other people, it also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?
"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with an Internet, we came up with the Internet. And I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.
"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyberwarfare. It is a, it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. They have computers.  They are so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly do-able. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing, but that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them."

At the second presidential debate, Trump dismissed claims that Russia is behind the hacks, questioned whether there are any hacks in the first place and said they have no business in Russia.
"But as far as other elements of what they were saying, I don't know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don't know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- they don't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia."

Trump questioned whether Russia was behind election hacks.
"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?" they tweeted.

Trump suggested again that Russia may not have been behind the hacking.
"I just want them to be sure, because it's a pretty serious charge," Trump told reporters at a New Year's Eve party in Mar-a-Lago, according to The Guardian . "And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong."

Trump referred to Russian hacking as "so-called" on Twitter.

"While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines," Trump said in a statement following the briefing. "There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful."

"And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could've had hacking defense, which we had. And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, they went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.

Trump said he's neutral regarding WikiLeaks and Julian Assange's actions during the 2016 election in an interview with The Associated Press
"When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, 'Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.' You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren't able to get through to Republicans," Trump told the AP.
Asked if they supported what Assange did, Trump said: "No, I don't support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn't have allowed it to get out."

Hackers could have been China or "a lot of different groups," Trump said on CBS' "Face The Nation."

The Northern Territory Government in Australia is repealing old legislation which makes tarot card reading and witchcraft illegal.
A recent review of the Territory's Summary Offences Act found a law citing anyone caught conjuring spells or predicting the future could face one year in prison.
The ABC reports the Witchcraft Act of 1735 was inherited from Britain and has since been repealed in most other parts of the Western world.
Attorney-General John Elferink said a legal quirk meant it stayed on the Territory's statute books.
They said a year in prison is a pretty stiff punishment for a tarot card reader and promised to finally repeal the legislation.
Tammy Hatherill, a tarot card reader and teacher based in Darwin, said readings are popular in the Top End. But, they said, many people do not know the Witchcraft Act exists, so getting rid of it would not make much difference.

It was open warfare at San Francisco's Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, as the moderates lashed out at their progressive colleagues, accusing them of extortion and playing politics with people's lives, and the progressives retorting that the moderates played sneaky underhanded politics. Board President London Breed twice had to remind their colleagues to speak to each other civilly.
The tension between the two factions has been building for months and finally spilled into public view in an unusually vitriolic exchange over Supervisor Malia Cohen's proposed ballot measure to increase police accountability by expanding the authority and scope of the independent Office of Citizen Complaints.
The progressive majority refused to put it on the ballot as a stand-alone measure and instead, over Cohen's objections, folded it into Supervisor David Campos' proposed ballot measure to create an office of public advocate — which Cohen and the other moderates oppose. That measure was later continued until next week's board meeting.
While various progressive supervisors said it made sense to merge the two “good government measures,” retaliation also played a role.
Last week, Cohen attempted to amend the public advocate ballot measure to require elected officials to sit out one term — four years — before running for the office. That infuriated Campos, who is widely considered a potential candidate if voters decide to create the position. They angrily accused Cohen of protecting the mayor. Also, Cohen helped put on the November ballot a homeless measure the progressives abhor that would allow authorities to remove tent encampments as long as they give 24-hour notice and an offer of a bed.

Progressive Supervisor John Avalos, who proposed merging Cohen's proposal with the public advocate measure, said they were tired of playing nice. “When a good part of my colleagues are being uncooperative, uncommunicative and uncollegial in their politics, it makes no sense to try the Pollyanna approach,” Avalos said before Tuesday's meeting of the moderate opposition.
Cohen and the other moderates were fuming during the meeting.
“We are going to sit back and allow the dirtiness of politics to touch this incredibly thoughtful and substantive piece of legislation,” Cohen said of their proposal. “We cannot politicize black and brown lives.”
The vitriol really ratcheted up after Supervisor Scott Wiener all but accused the progressives of running a cabal. Their comments came after the progressives bottled up their ballot measure to require the city to take responsibility for street trees — which until Tuesday appeared to have the six votes necessary to go on the ballot. It was also continued until next week.
“It's outrageous that this is happening,” they said. “But that is what this Board of Supervisors has now come to. There is a majority that has decided they are going to flex their muscle, and if you're not on their team, your ballot measure is dead.”
Supervisor Mark Farrell also railed against the progressives.
“It's the same thing as if my children come to me saying we will not do our homework unless you give us ice cream,” they said. “In their minds it might be related, but to any objective person watching that scenario unfolds they are completely unrelated and it's an attempt at extortion. It's subverting the democratic process here at the Board of Supervisors, and I think it's disgusting.”
That prompted Avalos to respond: “Nobody in this room has a monopoly on self-righteous indignation.”
Basis of tension
Much of the tension stems from the fact that the board's important committees have moderate majorities. The progressives have a 6-5 majority on the full board — the balance of power shifted when progressive Supervisor Aaron Peskin won the November election against the mayor's handpicked candidate — but the committees, through which legislation and ballot measures must pass, remain in the hands of moderates.
That has generated an increasingly dysfunctional dynamic, with the moderates passing amendments that the progressives dislike, and the progressives then circumventing the committee process by using their majority to call special board meetings — including one Friday evening that the moderates refused to attend — in order to undo those amendments.
The moderates did eke out one major victory Tuesday. The board voted 8-3 to put a three-quarter-cents sales tax on the November ballot to fund homeless services and transportation, with three progressive supervisors joining their moderate colleagues.
Up until the vote, it was unclear if the measure had the votes to be placed on the ballot. Avalos helped craft the deal only to withdraw their support after the moderates put the tent camp measure on the ballot. But on Tuesday they said they would support it after all, given that no other alternatives sources of revenue could be found.
“I will lay down my arms and support it,” they said.

Loryn Barclay, a substitute teacher in the Monett school district in Missouri, has been arrested and charged for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old male student: Monett Police Department
A female substitute teacher has been arrested and charged with alleged sexual contact with a 17-year-old student in Missouri.
Loryn Barclay, 24, has been charged with purportedly having sex with the student in their car and at their home on numerous occasions between November 2016 and January 2017.
They have been charged with six counts of alleged sexual contact in two Missouri counties, according to The Monett Times newspaper.
A local police officer who also serves at the school, Jay Jastal, was tipped off about the possible relationship.
Mr Jastal said Ms Barclay reportedly told them they were in fact involved in an "inappropriate relationship". They said they do not believe at this time that any other students were involved with the teacher.
"When we became aware of potential involvement with a student, we followed all procedures by informing the Children's Division," Superintendent of the Monett school district Brad Hanson told the newspaper.
"We had a conversation with them and they were not employed from then on. We learned about it the day of their exit as an employee. We dealt with it swiftly," they said.
The county prosecutor pressed charges against Ms Barclay and was released on $25,000 bail for the Lawrence County charges.  They are yet to be arrested in Barry County and has a $10,000 bail for those charges.
Ms Barclay is due in court on 24 July in Lawrence County.

In the space of six days last week, four Northern Ontario Indigenous youths made the grim decision to end their lives.
The situation is a terrible shock to the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which numbers less than 50,000. It is an unspeakable tragedy for the affected families. It is a scandal.
And yet nothing about it is unusual.
Story continues below advertisement
In 2015, a spate of suicides hits the northern Innu communities of Quebec. Last year, there were the six young girls who took their own lives in Saskatchewan in a single month. This past winter, two 12-year-olds in Wapekaka, Ont., did likewise.
The suicide rates among Indigenous Canadians are among the very highest in the world. Suicide and self-inflicted injuries are the leading causes of death among Indigenous people under 45.
Read that last paragraph again.
If these were kids living in suburban Toronto – or indeed anywhere within easy television satellite truck distance of a major city – it would be the only news anyone talked about, and a national crisis. There would be commissions of inquiry, marches on Parliament Hill.
Around the time the four Nishnawbe youths were staring into the abyss, much was being made of the palpable, visible anger expressed by several aboriginal leaders on the occasion of the 150th Canada Day.
They have every right to be furious; everyone in this country should feel their rage, and share it. But the simple fact is most Canadians don't – which is infuriating in itself.
As the Indigenous commentator Robert Jago has noted, "The Native death toll in any given year is as bad as the U.S. saw in a decade of fighting for civil rights."

If that comparison sounds overwrought – and it shouldn't, because it's a fact – then perhaps it's worth considering the words used by Bernard Lefrançois, the Quebec coroner who investigated the 2015 Innu suicides.
"I believe and see evidence that the great fundamental problem lies with the 'apartheid' system into which Aboriginals have been thrust for 150 years or more," they wrote.
The treatment of First Nations in Canada is nothing short of a national shame.
But while we're arguing on national television about protests, counter-protests and whether Cornwallis collected Mi'kmaq scalps, or debating symbolic gestures like the renaming of National Aboriginal Day or the Langevin Block, children are dying.
So what can be done?
Approaching the problems of Indigenous communities with greater urgency would be a start.

Suicide is a complex phenomenon, but the risk factors are well established. The taking of one's own life it is intimately linked to broader social pressures and living conditions. There is no mystery to any of this.
Unsafe drinking water, the various on-reserve housing crises, and deep psychological and emotional distress can't be dealt with overnight, or even in a summer. But that's no excuse for not trying.
The federal government is committed to the file, at least in its pronouncements and the priority it places on reconciliation. But all too often these days, symbolism is being substituted for action.
At the same time that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was visiting a protest tepee on Parliament Hill, their government's lawyers were using narrow points of law to fight compliance orders from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to adequately fund aboriginal child welfare.
Ottawa budgeted $635 million in early 2016 to address that specific problem, but the largest sums won't be spent until after the 2019 federal election.
The difficulties facing First Nations communities are multifarious, need varies greatly. Billions are spent each year trying to solve a dizzying assortment of problems. Just this year, Ottawa says it spent $900,000 in emergency assistance to Wapekeka, a fly-in community of 430 that had an effective suicide prevention program until 2014, when funding ran out.
Story continues below advertisement
It was in 1993 that a suicide crisis in Davis Inlet, a Labrador Innu community that has since been evacuated, captured the nation's attention. In 1995, Neskantanga First Nation in Ontario issued a boil-water advisory. It is still in effect.
One has to wonder how much progress has been made in the intervening years, because what we're doing clearly isn't working.
If it's a case of more money, spend it. If it's a case of hiring more mental-health and social workers, do it.
Most of all, we must treat this as an emergency, and act accordingly. There is no higher priority than the lives and safety of Canadian children.
No one must be allowed to look away.
Actress Patricia Heaton took no crap on "Everybody Loves Raymond." As it turns out, they have no patience for nonsense off the small screen as well. Like many of us, they have witnessed the ongoing battle between CNN and President Trump over the president's WWE tweet, which was created by a Reddit user. It was clearly a joke, yet the network took it as a threat, releasing a statement condemning the president for inciting violence.
Then, on Tuesday, CNN took the unprecedented step of threatening to expose the Reddit user's identity.
That was when Heaton says the network has gone a few steps too far.

Chris Cuomo, who co-hosts "New Day" with Alisyn Camerota, tweeted that they were sick of faceless users' cowardice. Unfortunately, social media noticed their lack of self-awareness.

It wasn't until the Reddit user issued an unnecessary apology that CNN mercifully dropped its unmasking threat.
"The reason that I think this is so notable … This is a very, full-throated, genuine honest apology," Camerota said. "He has also asked that we not reveal their name or whereabouts, and we at CNN are honoring that because he's apologized, and they think that they would then be in danger and at risk if other people knew their name. We get it. We understand that."
President Trump's WWE gif is now their most retweeted tweet of all time.
Nigeria had to beat Group A winners South Africa in their last qualifier at their new stadium in Uyo to stand a chance of defending their title at the Jan. 17 to Feb. 8 continental championship.
They were 2-0 down shortly after halftime, however, after quick goals either side of the interval from striker Tokelo Rantie. Nigeria pulled one back from Sone Aluko with 22 minutes remaining and the Hull City striker then equalised deep into stoppage time against opponents, who had been reduced to 10 men for the last 19 minutes.
Congo finished second behind South Africa after a 1-0 win in Sudan, where Francis Ndanga's second-half free kick ensured that veteran coach Claude Le Roy will go to a record-extending eighth tournament.
Guinea beat Uganda 2-0 in Casablanca to finish second in Group E behind Ghana, who topped the standings after a 3-1 home win over Togo. Guinea had to move their match to a neutral venue because of a ban on playing at home where the deadly Ebola virus has claimed more than 1,000 lives.
The game was held in Morocco, who were stripped of hosting the tournament last week after asking for a postponement amid fears that fans travelling to the finals could spread the virus to their country.
Mali ended Algeria's 100 percent record in Group B to book their place with Seydou Keita scoring a first-half penalty and Mustapha Yatabare adding a second after the break in a 2-0 win in Bamako. Ivory Coast needed only to draw with already-qualified Cameroon and squeezed through in a goalless clash against a side reduced to 10 men for the last half-hour after captain Stephane Mbia was sent off.
The top two teams in each of the seven groups qualified plus the best third-placed finisher, which was the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two goals from Yannick Bolasie in a 3-1 home win over Sierra Leone helped them to nine points from their six matches, but they had to wait several hours for their place to be confirmed.
Record winners Egypt could have snatched their spot had they won by two goals away in Tunisia, but they fell to a 2-1 defeat despite leading 1-0 at halftime. Algeria and the Cape Verde Islands qualified after just four groups matches last month and were joined after the weekend's penultimate round by Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia and Zambia.
New hosts Equatorial Guinea, disqualified in the preliminary knockout rounds for fielding an illegible player, have also been handed a place at the finals.

A Republican consultant says singer Kid Rock would be “prohibitive favorite” if they enter the Michigan Senate race.
“I think there's no question about that. I think he's the prohibitive favorite if they get in,” Dennis Lennox, a Michigan-based Republican political consultant, told Politico.

The musician, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, just needs to steer clear of getting caught up in any serious scandals, Lennox said.
“Presuming Kid Rock doesn't get caught in bed with a little boy or beat up a woman between now and August 2018, he's going to win the nomination if they get in,” Lennox predicted.
Another Republican warned against writing the entertainer off early, pointing to the difference between Ritchie and the typical pool of seasoned, well-groomed candidates.
“The fact that he's nontraditional is appealing to a lot of people. Obviously, it scares others who want someone more predictable,” Saul Anuzis, the former Michigan GOP party chairperson, told Politico.
Anuzis said Ritchie would stand out compared to the other candidates as well as the Democratic incumbent, Sen.

“But if you're going to beat an entrenched candidate like Debbie Stabenow in a purple state, you need to do something different,” Anuzis said, adding that Ritchie is “a hometown darling” in the state.
"He's got deep connections to Detroit. He's done a lot throughout the state,” Anuzis continued. “Anybody who's writing them off is making a mistake.”

You're forgiven if you missed, during the past few weeks of political chaos, that Donald Trump has vowed to sign the anti-LGBT First Amendment Defense Act and undo President Obama's executive orders and other efforts to protect LGBT people from discrimination. Indeed, they are one of the most anti-LGBT candidates in history.
Here's a look at what's at stake for our families.
The LGBT community has never enjoyed as many policy wins as in the years of the Obama administration. During the Obama presidency, we celebrated monumental victories — from a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and winning marriage in the Supreme Court to small but important initiatives such as Health and Human Services funding for LGBT refugees in Chicago and the opening of the first national resource center for older LGBT people. The last eight years have afforded our community the greatest growth in equality we have ever seen.
How did we come so far in light of the gridlock in Congress? The answer lies in small changes in the implementation of laws, the setting of priorities, and the tedious process of rule-making that happens in the Executive Branch. Cabinet members of the Obama administration have made many significant advances in our rights. In their first year in office, the president issued a directive to agency and department heads that opened the door for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Office of Personnel Management to extend domestic-partner benefits to foreign service members and domestic employees respectively.
At the president's request, Attorney General Eric Holder oversaw a meticulous two-year review of the constitutionality of DOMA that ended with the announcement that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the law. After the United States v. Windsor decision struck down parts of DOMA and after Obergefell v. Hodges made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, Obama instructed their cabinet to review and update thousands of marriage regulations — taxes, Social Security payments, and beyond.
These administrative changes — sometimes slow-moving, incremental, and all but invisible to the public — have added up to impressive advancements in our community. The administration opened visitation rights at hospitals for LGBT families, banned anti-LGBT discrimination by the federal government and its contractors, issued policy guidance about the fair treatment of transgender students, prohibited discrimination in Housing and Urban Development's housing programs, dedicated the Stonewall Inn as a national monument, and so much more. During the past eight years, the Obama administration created a federal task force on bullying, banned discrimination in health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, developed the first national strategy to address HIV and AIDS, and supported legislation banning conversion therapy.
The long list of the Obama administration's accomplishments — too long to list here — has already made a difference in the lives of LGBT people, but much is left to do. We can achieve full legislative equality for LGBT Americans; look at how far we've come in such short time. But our vision can only be accomplished through working hand in hand with the next administration, and not losing momentum. It is critical that the next administration continue to work with our community to advance LGBTQ equality — our future is at stake.

Counter-Strike community comes together to help streamer
Disabled streamer Adam ‘Loop' Bahriz probably didn't imagine this week turning out quite as well as it has.
The much-maligned world of eSports had a win this week, as the Counter-Strike community came together to prove they are decent human beings, rather than the basement dwelling sociopaths some would have you believe they are. Following a post regarding an incident that happened in a random pickup game, where a player was bullied out of the team for what their peers initially thought was trolling, but turned out to be the truth.
The player in question is one Adam ‘Loop' Bahriz. Born with an extremely rare genetic disorder called Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type II (HSAN2), Loop is legally blind and deaf, and sits extremely close to their screen as a result when streaming Counter-Strike, their game of choice, as well as having to deal with a massive disadvantage compared to unimpaired players. Despite that, he's already spent time in the top echelon of online matchmaking, and is currently not far off as a legendary player.
A game that saw them bullied, muted, and then kicked after having explained to their teammates that they couldn't communicate due to their condition made it to the front page of the reddit sub, and created some ire. This is slightly inconsistent with the general reaction to such behaviour, but that can be explained to some extent by the exceptional nature of Loop's condition, and normally the three day bans secured for the bullies would be where it all ends.
However, this story had rather longer legs, as it turned out, with the community coming together to show Loop some love, and that they have a heart after all. Their next stream saw them go from ten to over 1000 viewers, as well as multiple donations, some from big names like Johannes “tabseN” Wodarz and Mohamad “m0e” Assad, both of whom gave hundreds of dollars of their own cash. Top players were also seen in their streamed games, and some of the best Loop plays made it to the top of the Counter-Strike sub.
That's not where it ended for Loop though, as the next day saw them contacted by multiple teams about repping them as a streamer, including EnVyUs, winners of the biggest prize in Counter-Strike history, and Immortals who invited the player and their family to visit their headquarters. With all that to look forward to, and the stream success giving them funds for vital medical treatment too, it's fair to say this week has been a great one for Loop, and one that the Counter-Strike community can feel proud of too.

A man, 76, has died in hospital following a shooting and car crash this morning in the Montreal neighbourhood of Saint-Michel.
Police say the victim appeared to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Montreal police Const. André Leclerc said investigators are looking at the "circumstances that led to the gun shots, and possibly, the collision."
Police received reports of gunfire around 4:15 a.m. on Thursday at the corner of Charland and Rancourt streets.
One of the two vehicles involved in the shooting left the area at high speed when it struck another vehicle at the intersection of St-Michel and Industriel boulevards.
The other vehicle involved in the shooting, a white car, fled the scene. Police are still looking for that vehicle.
Police now say two vehicles involved in shooting; one was involved in crash a short time later; the other fled the scene —@Steverukavina
The driver of the other car, a man in their 20s, is being questioned by investigators.
Leclerc said the man is known to police.
The scene of the accident remained cordoned off Thursday morning, with a stretch of St-Michel Boulevard closed to traffic.
'Mesozoic Cow' Rises from the Sahara Desert

The sands of the Sahara Desert have delivered a new and very strange dinosaur: an elephant-size beast whose skull and jaw are unlike anything scientists have ever seen. They are calling it the "Mesozoic Cow."
Paleontologist Paul Sereno, who discovered the bones, has a reputation for finding new kinds of dinosaurs in out-of-the-way places. This find was unearthed in Niger, where it had been buried under the sand since the Mesozoic era, 110 million years ago. Sereno spent years piecing together the creature's bones. When they got the head and jaw together, they were shocked.
"Well the first thing that comes to my mind is that this is the weirdest dinosaur I've ever seen," they say. "It's some kind of Darth Vader dinosaur when you look at the skull. You put the skin on it and ... most people think it looks like a vacuum."
The "skin" is a plastic rendering of what the animal, called Nigersaurus taqueti, looked like. Sereno calls Nigersaurus an "extreme dinosaur" — one of nature's more bizarre experiments.
"It has jaws wider than the skull," Sereno says. "There's no other animal that's done that. All the teeth [are] up front in some type of conveyer belt fashion to create these shears," says Sereno.
The shearing teeth are aligned across the front of the wide, boxy mouth like a row of sharpened piano keys. Sereno says the animal probably used the top and bottom rows like scissors to graze on low-growing ferns or primitive plants, like horsetail. Its mouth held as many as five replacements for each tooth at any one time and probably lost a row every month.
The scientists also discovered something unusual by doing computerized tomography of its skull; CT scans are like three-dimensional X-rays. The scans revealed the bony remains of the animal's "organs of equilibrium" — like the semicircular canals in our own ears that help us keep our balance. From the positioning of those organs, it looks as though the animal spent most of its time with its head pointed almost straight down. That's different from the way the big long-necked dinosaurs are usually depicted. Combined with the mower-like teeth, it reinforces the idea of a ground-level grazer.
Paleontologist Larry Witmer of Ohio University says the scientists couldn't have figured that out without CT scanning.
"What it's done for paleontology is opened up really whole new vistas for questions we can ask about dinosaurs. Things we never even thought we could ask, we can now even answer," Witmer says.
Nigersaurus has more surprises, which Sereno points out as they give a tour of its long, bony spine.
"The animal is about 30 feet long, and we are standing at the base of the neck that rises above our heads, and when you see the vertebrae in front of us, there's more air in each one of these vertebrae in the neck and in the back than there is bone," Sereno says.
In fact, many of the bones that make up the skull and jaw are remarkably thin and light. Sereno says they don't quite know what to make of that on such a big animal. It certainly wouldn't work on a mammal.
"Every mammal that has gone into serious chewing like a cow has made the skull more robust, they've enhanced the jaw muscles. This is breaking a lot of rules," they say. "I'm serving notice to the scientific community, to the biomechanics out there, you gotta explain this one."
The fossil remains of Nigersaurus are on display at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C., where Sereno is an explorer in residence when he's not teaching at the University of Chicago. Sereno describes the dinosaur in the latest issue of the online journal of the Public Library of Science.
A 30-year-old man is accused of impregnating a 16-year-old girl who they met while volunteering at a local church.
Jerome Wellny faces one count of sexual assault on a victim who is 16 or 17 years old, records show.
Wellny developed a relationship with one of the youths they mentored at a local church, Fort Lauderdale Police Det. Keven Dupree said. During the course of several months, Wellny and the girl talked on the phone and met, police said.
They had sex multiple times, and the girl became pregnant, Dupree said. Lab results confirmed Wellny is the father, they said.
Wellny was booked into jail at 9 a.m. Monday and appeared before a judge Tuesday morning.
Their defense attorney told the judge Wellny cooperated with police during the investigation, retained a lawyer and turned themselves on Monday as instructed by a detective. Wellny's wife also spoke at the hearing, telling the judge their husband is the main provider for them and their three young boys.
"This is still a serious crime, but I will take into consideration they have strong family ties…he has no criminal record," Judge John "Jay" Hurley said. They set bond for Wellny at $5,000.
Wellny posted bond and was released from jail shortly after 1:15 p.m. Tuesday, jail records show.

On 15th October, 2016, members of a UK workers' coop launched a fundraising campaign to support the opening of a women-run worker's coop in Rojava. To date it has raised just over €4,000, and there are 11 days left to reach the stated target of €17,500. We had a chat with Sean from Birmingham Bike Foundry, to find out how this project came about.
You are raising money to support a women's bakery cooperative to open in Kobanî. How did this fundraising project come about?
We are attempting to raise £15k for a women's bakery cooperative in Rojava, in partnership with the organisation Re-Build and Kongreya Star (the umbrella organisation of the entire women's movement in Rojava).
Members of our coop in Birmingham first got involved in Kurdish solidarity organising after we put on a Kurdish film night, through our union the IWW. The film night ended up being very well attended by a group of Kurds from the local area. We have also been closely related to some of the work going on nationally, with the Plan C Rojava Solidarity Cluster and also attending the March 6th Stop War On Kurds demonstration. Through the links we developed, we learnt more about the revolution in Rojava, attended demonstrations and local Newroz (Kurdish New Year) celebrations. We wanted to work with the local community as a coop and provided two modules of a six-week English class through the union to those wanting to develop their English skills for dealing with the asylum process, workplace issues, and adjusting to life in the UK.
Our cooperative is part of the national federation of cooperatives Radical Routes and as such we were keen to interact with the struggle in Rojava in a tangible way through the cooperative structures we were involved in. Radical Routes cooperatives all have a commitment towards working towards social change and when our coops in Birmingham arranged for an information session given by the Nottingham Kurdish Solidarity group at the Radical Routes gathering in Nottingham earlier this year, it became clear that there was a willingness amongst the coop community in the UK to support the democratic confederal model in Rojava. From there we asked our links in the Kurdish community for an organisation in the UK which would be able to put us in touch with the cooperative structures in Rojava. We were put in touch with an organisation called re-build, and once we had met with them and fully explained the type of project we were interested in working with, they set about trying to find the relevant contacts in Rojava.
How was this specific coop chosen?
We wanted to work with a workers' coop like ourselves, as we believe in workers' control, autonomy and self-management – principles which are central to the democratic confederal model being enacted in Rojava. Re-build were in contact with Kongreya Star, the women's federation in Rojava, and they asked them if there were any projects which needed support and were in line with the criteria we laid out. Although there have been significant positive changes in the way things are run in the region since the revolution, not all support is useful. It is important for those in the West thinking about solidarity to be aware of the organisations and factors which determine how the resources and support are spent. One of the most inspiring things for those of us who have been learning about Rojava has been the empowerment of the women's movement in what is traditionally an incredibly patriarchal society. The fact that the project proposed to us attempted to tackle some of these issues of financial dependence on men through self-management of work in a cooperative was something that we were keen to support.
Who are the women involved in this coop, and what will the money go towards?
The women involved in setting up the coop are from Kongreya star, and as we have been working with Re-build we haven't had direct contact with them. We did receive a number of videos from the women where they explained the goals of the cooperative and the reason that it was being started as a project of Kongreya Star. The video with those clips in is available here:
The costs will cover an estimated €6,000 for the dough machines, freezers and fridges and kitchen equipment. Rent and salary for the first three months are estimated at around €5,000 and we are adding some leeway as inflation can be unpredictable due to the economic blockade by Turkey and surrounding states. Any extra money raised will go towards other worker cooperative projects in the region – or to similar projects being started by Kurdish refugees in the diaspora.
On your fundraising page you say, “We think it is important that the cooperative movement in the UK stands in solidarity with the people of Rojava” – Why?
In a time where the political centre is collapsing and there has been a swing towards neo-fascist politics in the USA and Europe, and widespread migrant scapegoating, cooperatives in the UK need to be clear on what their stance on international solidarity is. The last time the world faced a fascist threat on a large scale, cooperatives were pivotally involved in providing support to the international brigades engaged in the battle against Franco's fascists and disseminating information amongst the working classes in the UK.
Syria is currently a melting pot of political factions, external forces and powers at play. However, what is clear to us is that the attempt of implementing the democratic confederal model in Rojava is something that we see as very closely aligning with the cooperative principles. The resistance of the Syrian Democratic Forces and YPG/YPJ against the forces of ISIS are also a key part of the resistance against fascist ideology and is crucial to preventing the barbaric acts being carried out. The breaking of the siege of Kobanê was a key point in the battle against ISIS and for that reason it is very fitting that the bakery co-operative is planned to be set up there.
‘Resist Fascism, Build Co-operation' is the slogan of the fundraiser – and we see coops not as just static businesses there to benefit their members, they should do that of course, but if they are to follow the cooperative principles, they should actively be seeking to benefit the wider community both locally and internationally to fight against reactionary ideas. We don't see this fundraiser as purely charitable, but rather something that is about raising the idea and principles of cooperation and the situation in Syria to a wider section of people in the UK.
Have any other groups, coops, or other organisations been involved in this process? Who made your very beautiful eye-catching logo, for example?
Our logo was drawn by Ceinwen, who has been living in Radical Routes coop houses for many years. The inspiration for the logo came from some photos of guerrillas climbing a mountain taken by photographer Joey L. We have also had an absolutely gorgeous three-colour screen print made on some lovely thick poster paper for us by Mission Print in Digbeth, Birmingham. It's incredibly beautiful and we've already got a copy framed and hanging up on our wall. People can get their hands on one by donating to the fundraiser on the coopfunding website.
Aside from donating to this fundraiser, how can people support the coops and the wider revolution in Rojava?
First and foremost, we should state that providing practical solidarity in such a way that it challenges capitalism and supports the situation half a world away is super difficult and confusing. However, we would say that making contact with Kurds locally and attempting to support the organising work they are already probably engaged in is a very good start. This blog has some worthwhile points to take on board when thinking about solidarity work.
A second point of supporting the fundraiser is to raise awareness publicly – especially by going along to meetings of larger cooperatives, like retail cooperatives, and raising the issues talked about in this blog to the other members there. The role that the retail coop movement played in the 1930's, fundraising for ambulances and supplies for the international brigades fighting Franco, is often forgotten. Much of that militancy has been lost, but the only way we can get there is by challenging these cooperatives to stay true to their principles and support projects like this.
What happens if you don't reach your fundraising target?
Whatever they get will be useful. We are also appealing to larger coops, for whom it might take time to make a decision about donating, to still consider donating after the deadline. We will ensure that all the funds raised are made available to the bakery.
Anything else you would like to tell people?
Here is a link to a video we've put together explaining what our co-op has being doing to support the fundraiser and how other co-operatives can help out too:
House Republicans are scrambling after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's shock announcement that they were withdrawing from the speaker's race.
Some have floated the idea of finding a candidate who could fill the leadership seat in a temporary caretaker role.
Although the race has narrowed without the frontrunner, neither Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, nor Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., seems close to clinching the 218 votes necessary to win the seat.
As a stopgap, some members said they're interested in recruiting a representative who could serve as an interim speaker before leaving office in 2016.
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., called for a strategic appointment so that “the rest of us can focus on winning the election and making sure Americans are mobilized for the cause.”
“The best course would be for us to select a candidate for speaker who will serve in that capacity for the next 15 months,” Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., said in a statement.
Price, who had been running for majority leader before McCarthy withdrew their bid for speaker, explained that a caretaker “would allow the House to complete the business in a responsible manner, providing ample time for everyone's voices to be heard, leading into full leadership elections in November of 2016.”
“I wouldn't call it a placeholder,” Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Nebr., told reporters.
“I'd call it a shepherd for the moment, a short-term caretaker,” they explained—someone “who can continue to make our decisions, unify the conference, and doesn't have ambitions for anything else.”
Reps. Candice Miller of Michigan and John Kline of Minnesota could fit that description, according to Politico. Both have already announced they will not seek re-election, and both have been mentioned as alternatives by their House colleagues.
Shortly after McCarthy's announcement, Miller said in a statement that they respect “Kevin's decision and believes that, in the upcoming weeks, [the GOP] conference will elect a speaker with strong conservative values who can advance the people's agenda.”
A spokesperson from Kline's office said the member of congress “is confident House Republicans will select someone who can do what's best for our country and this institution.”
In response to a possible Kline candidacy, Mike Needham, CEO of Heritage Action, tweeted, “I'd prefer Boehner.”
Neither Kline nor Miller has ruled out a run.
Others strongly oppose the idea of a provisional speaker altogether. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, told The Daily Signal they think electing “a short-term caretaker would be a horrible decision.”
“The American people want Congress to get the country on the right track, not kick the can down the road. We need to elect a conservative leader now,” they said.
With McCarthy out, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called on Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to enter the race. According to The Washington Post, Boehner has called the representative twice over the phone, urging them to make a run.
In response, Ryan, the chairperson of the House Ways and Means Committee, echoed their earlier refusals.
“While I am grateful for the encouragement I've received,” Ryan said in a statement, “I will not be a candidate.” The former vice presidential candidate cited their chairperson responsibilities as reason for not running.
To fill the vacuum, Newt Gingrich has even been floated as a candidate. Talk radio personality Sean Hannity asked Gingrich about the possibility of a comeback speaker bid. Gingrich chuckled away the question at first.
Addressing House Republicans, the former speaker of the House said, according to The Washington Examiner, “You show up with 218 votes, I'll talk.”
Grania sent me an email (below) pointing out that my post on Hitchens's Vulture also got onto the internet via a tw**t by Lawrence Krauss, with a reaction from Christians that, I guess, was predictable. Lawrence Krauss tweeted your article on Hitchens and while most people responding to the tweet were appreciative, these believers (they self-identify as such in their Twitter bio) are positively salivating about atheists burning in hell. I think I might go and listen to a Jeff Dee rant on hellfire.
(Jeff Dee is a long-time host/co-host of The Atheist Experience and The Non-Prophets; and frequently got irked by Christians who called into the show threatening hell. Many of them thought they were “being nice” in issuing their little caveat; and they got their butts kicked all the way to Cairo by Jeff who pointed out that there is nothing remotely polite about telling someone that they deserve to be tortured forever.)
A nice piece by @Evolutionistrue on slimy book with false claims on Hitch conversion. I have piece coming out later. https://t.co/jx6PJP9Kmx — Lawrence M. Krauss (@LKrauss1) May 15, 2016
Here are the descriptions of those lovely Christians. I find these reactions odd—and un-Christian. Any God that would send somebody to eternal flames for not believing in Him is an immoral and reprehensible God. Is there any atheist who wishes that believers should be consigned to such punishment for their ignorance?
As a palliative, here's Jeff Dee and Matt Dillahunty taking down a Christian who claims that atheists go to hell (but God doesn't send them there!):
Can the power of the mind help humans self-heal? That's what a group of scientists is hoping to help determine by studying a Tibetan lama who believes they cured themselves of gangrene through meditation.
When Tibetan Lama Phakyab Rinpoche immigrated to the United States in 2003, they were a 37-year-old refugee with diabetes and Pott's Disease. Their afflictions had gotten so bad that their right foot and leg had developed gangrene. They were hospitalized and examined by three different doctors in New York City who all gave the same treatment recommendation: amputate.
Few people would go against such medical advice, but Rinpoche (pronounced Rin-Poh-Chey) is no average person. Born in 1966 in Kham, Tibet, they were ordained at the age of 13 and named the Eighth Incarnation of the Phakyab Rinpoche by the Dalai Lama themselves when they were working toward the highest level of Tibetan Buddhist study, the Geshe degree, in 1993. A deeply spiritual man who has devoted their life to the teachings of Buddhism, it was only natural that they should reach out to their mentor, Their Holiness the Dalai Lama, when deciding whether to allow their leg to be cut off.
The Dalai Lama's response was shocking: Do not amputate. Instead, Lama Rinpoche says, the Tibetan spiritual leader advised their protégé to utilize their virtuoso skills at Tsa Lung meditation— heal himself, and then teach others the value of the ancient tradition. They sent a letter prescribing additional mantras, such as the Hayagriva, which, at the outset of new endeavors, is said to clear obstacles and provide protection in their tradition.
It was a decision that would require an incomprehensible leap of faith. But Rinpoche says there was no doubt within him. Though doctors had made it clear they could die, they were not afraid. “As a Buddhist, what is the worst thing that could happen if I die?” they told The Daily Beast through a translator. “I would be reborn again. But to lose a leg in one lifetime because I didn't try to save it didn't make sense.”
And so they began to meditate. Rinpoche says they took no medicine and their diet was an ordinary one. They would break for meals—when the lama they were living with came home from work, they would have dinner and enjoy conversation—but then they would return to meditating before getting a good night's sleep at the end of the day. In the morning, they would awake and return to their routine.
In the early days of this ritual, Lama Rinpoche remembers, the putrid ooze from their leg ran black; a few months later it turned cloudy, they said, and bruising started to appear. The swelling increased and it was more painful. The odor was sickening, they recall. But still they felt no doubt.
The progression of the degradation wasn't simply halted—his leg was back from the dead.
Then, after nine months, they say something began to happen that many Americans would consider a miracle. The liquid leaking from their disabled leg began to run clear. The swelling went down. Soon they could put some weight on it. At ten months, they could walk again, first with crutches. A short time later they were down to one crutch, and then, before even a year had passed, they were walking on their own.
The progression of the degradation wasn't simply halted—his leg was back from the dead. Their diabetes and complicating Tuberculosis are gone today as well.
Now, a group of doctors at New York University have begun studying Rinpoche—specifically, their brain. Practitioners of Tsa Lung meditation like Rinpoche visualize a wind (or “lung,” or “prana”) that is one with the mind, moving down the center channel of their bodies, clearing blockages and impurities before moving on to ever-smaller channels.
"This is a cognitive-behavioral practice that present East-West science suggests may be more effective that any existing strictly Western medical intervention,” says Dr. William C. Bushell, an MIT-affiliated researcher in medical anthropology and director of East-West Research for Tibet House in New York. Gangrene is not curable by current medical intervention once past a certain point in its progression, except by amputation.
This month, Dr. Bushell and NYU neuroscientist Zoran Josipovic, Ph.D. won Lama Rinpoche's cooperation in undergoing a functional MRI scan of their brain while they meditated inside the scanner at NYU's Center for Brain Imaging. In this first scan the Rinpoche participated in an ongoing study of the effects of different types of meditations on anti-correlated networks in the brain that Dr. Josipovic has been conducting at NYU.
Bushell wrote a scientific analysis of the processes occurring in the same form of meditation used by Rinpoche in a letter to Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Prize winner in medicine, some 10 years ago. Dr. Lederberg was one of the giants of modern science, father of molecular biology, infectious disease medicine, and modern genetics. Their foundation published the letter, which is actually an adaptation of a scientific paper, posthumously on their website. It speaks of the mild to moderate hyperthermia resulting from the practice, which kills bacteria and aids the body in healing.
“It is not entirely clear from a Western science perspective what the winds are, but the scientific evidence suggests to me and others that the meditative process involving winds includes increased local blood flow, metabolic activity, and oxygenation,'' Bushell explains. “The original scientific model I developed (which is largely in a theoretical state) was based on, among other things, the pioneering work of Thomas K Hunt, MD, on the antibiotic properties of oxygenation in the blood and surrounding tissues, and was sponsored by the Institute of Noetic Sciences in Petaluma, Calif. Research shows that mental imagery directed to sites of the body, both superficial and deeper tissues, can with practice eventually lead to increased local blood flow, metabolic activity, and oxygenation. Such increases could in principle combat even powerful bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, which not only can be the cause of gangrene, but is now often times resistant to antibiotics.”
Dr. Bushell's colleague Dr. Josipovic was also very curious about Rinpoche's abilities and, in particular, about the way they may have affected the functional and structural organization of their brain. The early results of the test are significant at first glance, they say. They show changes in a wide network of brain areas mediating attention and awareness. The team will publish their findings next year.
“Over the past 10 years research into the effects of meditation on the brain has been gaining unprecedented public and scientific attention,” Dr. Josipovic explains. “What these studies have shown is that it is possible to optimize one's life experience through cultivation of subtle cognitive states generated through meditation, and that these are accompanied by changes in the anatomical structure of the brain, or neuroplasticity. But what soon became evident was that a great variety of meditation techniques and states of consciousness they engender, pose a considerable challenge for understanding them in terms of the established constructs of Western science.”
Dr. Josipovic says that a major new discovery in the field of neuroscience, that of spontaneously fluctuating resting-state networks in the brain, has the potential to shed some light on this issue. “On a global level, the brain appears to be organized into two large-scale networks: extrinsic, or the task-positive network, composed of the brain areas that are active when we are focused on some task or external environment, and the intrinsic, or ‘default' network, composed of the areas that are active when we reflect on ourselves and own experience.”
These networks are usually anti-correlated in their activity—that is, when one is “up” the other is “down,” they say. “While this antagonism serves some healthy functions, for example, of allowing us to focus on a task and refrain from being distracted by daydreaming or irrelevant concerns, we suspect it may also underlie some unhealthy aspects of our everyday experience, such as excessive fragmentation between self/other and internal/external—in other words the ‘dualistic mind' that many contemplative traditions see as the root of our suffering.''
Those who wish to begin a Tsa Lung practice, which is an advanced but achievable discipline, are encouraged to seek a teacher. Rinpoche themselves teaches often across the country, and is adding a website www.awakeningmindfoundation.org and Skype to their teaching sessions to reach more people around the world. This year they will lead a special New Year gathering in Tubac, Arizona sponsored by Pocket Sanctuary and the Helen Graham Park Foundation.
MaryAnn Zitka, a medical researcher and senior student of Phakyab Rinpoche explains that the word Rinpoche is a Tibetan Buddhist honorific title that literally means the precious one. “This is a very appropriate title to me,” they say. “It's not often that you meet someone so committed to helping others. Rinpoche freely teaches their wisdom traditions to all who wish to learn, and their only request is to practice.”

The last several years have left California facing a series of water emergencies, as the usual winter rainfall hasn't materialized. The drought has been associated with a ridge of high-pressure air off the Pacific Northwest coast, which prevents storms from the Western Pacific and Alaska from reaching California. That ridge, in turn, has been associated with warm sea surface temperatures in the area.
Beyond the immediate causes, however, it's reasonable to ask whether the drought is a symptom of a warming climate, and thus whether we should expect more of them in the future. Several papers have already looked into the matter, with mixed results. But now, NOAA has weighed in with a report that pins the blame on natural variability. But the report has come under criticism from some scientists, and it may have been finalized before some recent, relevant papers.
There are a number of ways to ask whether a particular event (or, in this case, a series of events) is natural or driven by human influences. Events should not be viewed as conclusive on their own, but collectively, they can build a case. The NOAA report tries a number of these.
One of the simplest is to ask whether something like this has happened in periods before humanity's influence on the climate was as large as it is presently. The NOAA report's authors do this and conclude that it has. Although it's been excessively dry for several years, "these events are not without precedence," they write, highlighting other dry periods on the record. They also note that, when the 120-year historic precipitation record is considered, there's no trend toward drier conditions.
That would seem to suggest that natural variability could be a sufficient explanation for the recent drought. But a separate study that has been posted in advance of publication has looked at the same problem using tree ring data. It finds that, while three-year droughts are common in the record, the current drought has put trees underwater stress that they've never experienced in the last 1,200 years. So, the drought may be historically unprecedented after all.
But the majority of the NOAA report focuses on the use of climate models to explore the conditions that produced this drought. As in previous studies, the models suggest that the lack of rainfall can be traced back to warm surface waters in the Eastern Pacific, which set up the high-pressure ridge that blocks California from the source of its rain systems. This accounts for a bit less than half of the tendency to drought, however; the rest they ascribe to natural variability in atmospheric conditions.
A key question is whether this variability—or at least three consecutive years of it—is normal. It's a bit hard to say, given that the models that were used did not fully couple the atmosphere and the oceans, such that sea surface temperatures couldn't respond to atmospheric conditions. Things are also complicated by the fact that the sea surface temperatures in each of the years look somewhat different in terms of their location and extent, which makes it hard to ascribe them all to a single underlying cause.
What finally seems to have pushed the authors over the edge on their conclusion that the drought is natural is the fact that models don't predict that warming temperatures will produce the pattern of rainfall seen during these drought years. They do predict a dry spring, but the warm sea surface should also produce an early winter burst of rain that partly offsets that. Since that burst never materialized, the authors conclude that these winters haven't been the product of warming.
That conclusion, however, has been criticized by other scientists (a typical example of the criticism comes from Michael Mann, who elaborated on their criticism in a blog post). California, they point out, has been suffering through unusually warm weather during the drought, which has accelerated evaporation. The full impact of the drought, they contend, can't be captured simply by looking at the lack of rain.
In the end, the NOAA report leaves things almost exactly where they were when we looked at the topic last. Some of the conditions that contributed to the drought are what you might expect to see in a warming world—warmer sea surface temperatures, hotter atmospheric temperatures at the site of the drought—but models don't predict a simple fall off in the amount of rain California receives. Until we can get into the causes that are driving the sea surface changes in more detail, we're not likely to be able to fully ascribe the drought to either natural or human causes.
A copy of the NOAA report has been posted online.
Ottawa's police chief is defending their decision to hire a Somali-Canadian man as a constable despite concerns about both the timing and the new officer's driving record.
Chief Charles Bordeleau made the decision to hire Mohamed Islam the same day that 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi, another man from the city's Somali-Canadian community, was pronounced dead after what witnesses described as a violent confrontation with police.
"I can tell you unequivocally that the decision to hire this officer had nothing to do with Mr. Abdi's death," Bordeleau told CBC News Tuesday.
Islam, who did not speak to CBC Tuesday, was awarded a community safety award in 2013 for their work with local at-risk youth. At the time, they helped find young Ottawans jobs as part of the Somali Youth Support Project.
However, according to excerpts from a civilian background investigator's resignation letter published by Postmedia, the officer was hired for "political reasons" and their multiple convictions under the Highway Traffic Act, inconsistencies in their application, and previous negative interactions with police while being pulled over made them "unsuitable" for police work.
Abdi died on July 25, one day after their arrest following reports of a disturbance at a Bridgehead coffee shop on Wellington Street West and Fairmont Avenue. The Special Investigations Unit, Ontario's police watchdog, is now looking into the circumstances of that arrest.

'Not the deciding factor'
Bordeleau said Tuesday they were "extremely concerned and disappointed" that information about the new officer's background check had been leaked to the media, and they defended their decision to hire Islam.
"As people would know who have participated in the hiring process, it's a very long and extensive and rigorous process. It takes up to a year for you to get hired by a police service," Bordeleau said.
"That process involves several stages, including a number of interviews, psychological testing, physical testing, one-on-one interviews, and a background check. And that background check is only one component of the entire process. And that is not the deciding factor."
Bordeleau also said the July 25 hiring date involved the discussion of 19 potential candidates, not just Islam, and had been set two months before Abdi's death.
"He's a citizen of our great city who has worked very hard with youth, specifically Somali youth," said Bordeleau, citing their work with the police community advisory committee, local Somali-Canadian basketball leagues, and the Pinecrest-Queensway Community Health Centre.
"One of the challenges that we're having now as a police service is to bridge that gap and the trust issue between young black males in our community. And who better to bring in than somebody who's actually working in that field."
Candidate not yet officially hired
In an email sent Tuesday, the chair of the Ottawa Police Services Board wrote that any questions about Islam's qualifications and suitability are "premature" because only the board can officially appoint officers to the force.
And Islam has not yet been presented to the board as a candidate, Eli El-Chantiry wrote.
"The chief may select and recommend candidates to be hired as Ottawa police officers, but it is only the board that can appoint them. To date, this candidate has not been presented to the board for appointment.
"The board will have an opportunity to satisfy itself that the candidate is suitable to become an Ottawa police officer, if and when the chief presents them for appointment in the future."

4 Chicago Running Paths to Get Your Heart Pumping
Chicago is basically a runner's paradise, and now is the time of year to get outside and enjoy the warm temps while getting in a solid workout.
There's no shortage of picturesque scenes to serve as a backdrop for your daily jog. Here are a few of the more memorable routes to try out.
Chicago Riverwalk
Distance: 2.5 miles
With an almost nine-block distance, the Chicago Riverwalk is a comfortable run path that's a good start for more intense distances. The path is under Wacker Drive and goes through the downtown stretch of the Chicago River. Although it's simple and short, a few stops by fountains or benches provide ample time for stretching. It may be more congested during the summer, but it's still one of the more iconic routes due to its amazing skyline views.
The 606
Distance: 2.7 miles
This route is all about elevation and urban beauty. Starting from Ashland Avenue to Ridgeway Avenue, the path will have runners 20 feet above Logan Square, Bucktown, Humboldt Park and Wicker Park. With plenty of access points, any experienced runner can appreciate the less strenuous distance. Bridges and slight elevation allow runners to enjoy the community art projects around the path, or the neighborhoods' architecture from below.
Lakefront
Distance: 18 miles
Although one of the longest trails on this list, runners will undoubtedly love the workout and sights to see on this path. Extending from the North Side at Ardmore Street to 71st street on the South Side, the path shows off the best of Chicago. Runners will pass by attractions like Navy Pier, Soldier Field, Lincoln Park Zoo and many more. Of course, it's not as quiet as other routes, as bikers, skaters and tourists tend to flood the place during the summer time. However, much of the route is great for those training for a marathon or experiencing much of Chicago's scenic views.
Horner Park
Distance: 1 mile
Horner Park is located on the North Side of California Avenue between Montrose Avenue and Irving Park Road. A paved circular path populated by trees and a sweet view of the Chicago River is a calming experience. For those looking to warm up or work some laps, this is the perfect route. If you like to bring your pooch on your runs, there's a dog park where your four-legged friend can enjoy a break. Runners with some spare time can also relax with a nice picnic as well.
The Carolina Panthers hosted Jamal Adams on a pre-draft visit Monday, per NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport.
One of the elite safety prospects in the 2017 NFL Draft, Adams could be available for the Panthers with the No. 8 overall pick. Among five mock drafts by NFL.com analysts, none project the Panthers to select a defensive back at No. 8, and only one, Daniel Jeremiah, projects Adams to fall that far. Analyst Bucky Brooks believes Adams is the No. 1 overall prospect this year.
The NFL draft will be held April 27-29 in Philadelphia.
Adams isn't the only top prospect from LSU at the Panthers facility Monday. The club is also hosting RB Leonard Fournette, per Albert Breer of the MMQB. Fournette is expected to be the first running back selected. As with Adams, however, confidence that he'll be available at No. 8 is not high among NFL.com analysts.
Adams (6-foot, 214 pounds) is considered one of the draft's top two safety prospects, along with Ohio State's Malik Hooker. Another safety the club has shown some pre-draft interest in: UConn's Obi Melifonwu, who reportedly ate lunch with the Panthers following their pro day workout last month.

Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro 9.7: We compare Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S3 Android tablet with another powerful 9.7-inch creative device, the iPad Pro from Apple, to see which is best for you.
At MWC 2017, Samsung launched a powerful new Android tablet for creative and professional users. The Galaxy Tab S3 is sleek, well-specced and packed with great features, including support for Samsung's new stylus pen and keyboard cover. In other words, it's an Android alternative to Apple's rather brilliant iPad Pro.
If you already own an iPhone or Android device, chances are you'll find your loyalty swaying towards Apple's iOS ecosystem or Google's mobile OS. However, if you're not bothered either way – or perhaps thinking about switching between Android and iOS – then let us run through the specs and features of both the Galaxy Tab S3 and iPad Pro 9.7. Hopefully it'll make your tablet purchasing decision a little easier.
Samsung also launched two gorgeous Windows 10 tablets out at MWC, the Galaxy Book 10.6 and Galaxy Book 12. Go check out our Galaxy Book 10.6 vs 12 comparison review for more info.
Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Specs

Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Design
Both the Galaxy Tab S3 and the iPad Pro sport a slender and sleek design, although they're very different in look and feel.
Samsung has stuck with its Galaxy S7-style glossy finish for the Tab S3, blending glass surfacing with metal banding for an eye-pleasing effect. That glassy rear does pick up greasy prints rather easily, which can make you cringe when the light catches it. But once you buff it up, there's no denying it looks lovely.
At 6.1mm thick, the iPad Pro 9.7 is pretty much just as slim as Samsung's tablet. Of course, Apple hasn't altered its usual design language at all, so the Pro sports the same brushed metal finish of previous iPhones and iPads; albeit with a couple of different colour choices on offer.
Both tablets are pleasingly light considering the technology packed inside. In other words, they're a solid alternative to a laptop if you're always on the move and looking for something seriously portable. Neither are water resistant, but the Tab S3 and iPad Pro 9.7 are both rugged enough to survive a few knocks and bumps.
Note that you can also pick up the iPad Pro in a larger 12.9-inch model. Check out the differences between the 9.7-inch version and 12.9-inch version in our iPad Pro comparison review.

Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Screen and media
The iPad Pro 9.7 and Galaxy Tab S3 both rock a 9.7-inch display, with the same crisp resolution (2048×1536). That means supremely sharp visuals, no matter your choice.
However, the actual display tech is considerably different. In the case of the Galaxy Tab S3, you get Samsung's latest Super AMOLED panel, which produces rather stunning and vibrant images. Colours are artificially boosted to make them stand out, whereas the iPad Pro 9.7's IPS LCD panel renders more realistic images. Samsung's screen also supports HDR playback, offering impressive contrast levels and next-level visuals.
Whichever you like the most will come down to personal preference. However, both panels are pleasingly bright and boast wide viewing angles, so do the job nicely when out and about.
You can happily blast through a movie on either device, with stereo speakers that pump out impressively detailed audio. On both the Tab S3 and the iPad Pro, they're powerful enough to fill a small room with loud, clear sound.
Got a massive media collection that you'd like to lug around? Well, these two tablets come with 32GB of space as standard, but that'll fill up pretty quick once you start throwing HD movies on. Thankfully the Galaxy Tab S3 can be boosted with a microSD memory card, adding up to 256GB more space. On the iPad Pro, you have to pay up for the 128GB or 256GB model instead as there's no microSD support.
Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Features and accessories
Android and iOS both have their strengths and weaknesses, but in their iOS 10 and Android Nougat forms they both offer strong functionality. You can split-screen with two apps at once, download apps for pretty much every occasion and manage your tablet's resources, with the likes of battery saver modes and performance analysing to help out when needed.
Both the Galaxy Tab S3 and the iPad Pro 9.7 support a stylus pen of Samsung and Apple's own creation. In both cases this is a well-designed and comfortable-to-use stylus which offers impressively accurate translation of your flicks, taps and squiggles.
You also have the option of purchasing a keyboard cover for both tablets. This connects magnetically and protects the screen when not in use, before unfurling into a miniature board that sits in front of the display.
They're both decent enough for typing on the move, although some will prefer the deeper travel of the Tab S3's keys. However, the Tab S3's keyboard is also a little squished at the edges, with the likes of the left Shift key suffering quite considerably. And in both cases, you ideally need a flat surface to rest the tablet on for typing. Sitting the iPad Pro or the Galaxy Tab on your lap can be a bit awkward and uncomfortable.
Both tablets support SIM cards for 4G connectivity when you can't find a decent WiFi network.
Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Performance and battery life
The iPad Pro 9.7 is powered by Apple's own A9X processor, backed by 2GB of RAM. We've seen a couple of little stutters here and there during use, but on the whole you get a pleasingly smooth user experience. You can run powerful creative apps and play any game on the App Store with a solid frame rate.
In our hands-on review of the Galaxy Tab S3, we found the Snapdragon 820 processor provided just as smooth running. It's a shame Qualcomm's more powerful 821 chipsets wasn't used, but the 820 – backed by 4GB of RAM – does the job nicely for now.
The iPad Pro 9.7 delivers 10-12 hours of video playback on a single charge. Samsung reckons you'll get the same from the Tab S3, but we're yet to fully test this out. However, fast charging is also available on both tablets, when those cells finally run dry.
Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Cameras
We're not sure why you'd want to shoot a video with a tablet, but both devices sport a lens on the rear end all the same.
On the Galaxy Tab S3 you get a 13-megapixel snapper, while the iPad Pro has a 12-megapixel lens. Both cameras come with an LED flash and can shoot up to 4K resolution video.
Around the front of both tablets you have a 5-megapixel secondary lens. This is useful for Skype chats and in either case you'll capture a smooth, detailed image of your mug.
Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Verdict
Boasting very similar specs and features but two completely different ecosystems, the Galaxy Tab S3 and iPad Pro are certainly rivals for the best creative or business tablet in 2017.
You get impressive performance, solid battery life, premium screen tech and strong support from Samsung and Apple's optional accessories. So no matter which tab you choose, chances are you'll be very happy indeed.

Feb. 15, 2003 — exactly nine years ago Wednesday — lives in Lexington's collective memory as the day the power went out, the trees fell down and much of the city plunged into a week of frustrating darkness and freezing cold — a perfect ice storm of catastrophe.
Some might argue that the worst storm ever in Lexington was the 1998 surprise snow that dumped 11 inches on the city overnight. The ice storm of 2009 was more widely felt geographically.
But for a storm that changed Lexington's way of thinking about everything from where electrical wires should be to which faux fireplace to buy, it's hard to overlook the chaos that ensued after the ice swamp of 2003.
Nine years after Lexington and environs were coated in 1 to 2 inches of ice, snapping trees like swizzle sticks and leaving 146,000 people without power, the ice storm still has the power to terrify.
Sign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to the Lexington Herald-Leader
The local storm was considered part of the North American blizzard of 2003, but the destruction caused by the ice crippled the city long after temperatures began to rise.
Residents drove the streets in toasty vehicles to see which areas had electricity and how awful the destruction was. Many powerless streets took on the look of ice caves.
If — or better, when — another storm like that arrives, will we be better prepared? Will we be shivering in dark, drafty homes, bedding down in high school gyms, bunking with friends in unaffected areas and griping to anyone who will listen that we never even knew the name of that box that funnels power supply into our houses, much less that we were responsible for getting it fixed?
Then and now
One of the problems cited repeatedly during the ice storm's big week, Feb. 15 to 22, was that information about power outages was slow and imprecise. Not knowing was a huge problem in 2003.
Not any more, said Kentucky Utilities spokesperson Cliff Feltham.
Instead of the paper maps and push pins of nine years ago, the company now has extensive electronic mapping and an upgraded customer information system. In 2003, Feltham noted, "Our system got hosed up very quickly."
In 2003, KU spent $22.5 million on recovery efforts.
The utility also was criticized for its tree-trimming cycle, lack of Spanish translation options and the inability of customers to reach KU to seek information on their first two or three tries.
Urban County Councilwoman Linda Gorton summed up the communication problems toward the end of the tumultuous week of the ice storm: "It's easier for people to accept some bad news than no news at all."
Lexington has made progress in "special-needs sheltering" — locating and accommodating people who have health conditions and chronic illnesses — said Steve Jackson, operations manager for Lexington's emergency management program.
The biggest challenge in 2003, they said, was figuring out how extensive the power outages were and how much help was needed.
Several departments in Lexington's government each were totaling $32,000 a day in overtime.
Were we ready? No
The storm unveiled an unfortunate truth about Central Kentucky living: Our homes were far enough from their rural roots to often be dependent on a single heat source — but not so far into the Internet age that technologically advanced maps of power outages were available.
There weren't automated phone systems to report outages and receive updates, and a communications tool that we take for granted today, the smartphone, was in its infancy, and few consumers had one.
Weren't power lines supposed to be buried?
This seemed like a great idea before many homeowners got the harsh news about how much it would cost to bury the lines.
KU will figure out the cost and make a presentation to neighborhoods interested in burying their power lines, Feltham said. But after residents get numbers on how much it will cost them to bury the lines — a figure that often is as much as the cost of their homes — their enthusiasm wanes, they said.
Feltham also said that KU was reluctant to start a patchwork of neighborhoods with some utilities buried while some are still above ground.
What are the odds of another ice storm?
The Lexington area has a chance of getting a 3/4-inch coating of ice once every 50 years, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1951, an ice storm dumped 2 inches of frozen rain and sleet on Lexington, topped by more than 7 inches of snow, and then temperatures dropped to minus 8. Technology advances do not alter the odds.
Weatherhead? What?
During the ice storm, Central Kentucky homeowners learned a new word: weatherhead. Often this was prefaced by a word not suitable for a family newspaper.
To review, a weatherhead is a service point for your electrical service feed to enter the house, usually with a boxlike covering connecting to the electrical service pipe. Repairing weatherhead damage is the responsibility of the homeowner, as many learned just when they thought their homes were returning to the land of the heated.
Who knew first that we were in for big trouble?
Corey Pieper, then a University of Kentucky meteorologist and now with the National Weather Service in Texas, noticed that the ice accumulation was coming faster than anticipated on the evening of Feb. 15, 2003, as they drove from their home in south Lexington to a north Lexington pet store. Reached last week, they remember seeing precipitation freezing on car tops and thought, "This isn't good."
That night, they awoke to the sound of branches and trees snapping: "It sounded like giants were walking in the forest."
They were out early the next morning to see what had happened. "Being a weather nerd, I drove around," they said. "There was nobody around. It was surreal." Their home didn't have electricity for 61/2 days.
"I still tell people about it," they said.
'It didn't look real'
Bill Meck of WLEX (Channel 18) said that they and a fellow forecaster were stunned by the data suggesting the mammoth ice storm was heading Lexington's way. "The magnitude of the icing potential was so extreme that it didn't look real on the computer model we preferred using," they said.
Later, Meck got a first-hand look at the ice storm's aftermath as they struggled to make their way to the station in north Lexington: "I woke up at 2 to head to the station and I already had two large magnolias bent over in the front yard (they would both later snap)," they said. "The normal 20-minute trip took about an hour and 15 minutes."
'The worst thing that ever happened to me'
UK employee Paula Dunn awoke after the ice storm to glance out the window of their north Lexington home and see their car encased in ice and surrounded by fallen trees. They stepped out on their deck in time to see their home's weatherhead get knocked out by a falling tree branch.
Them sump pump went out, causing flooding in their house that caused condensation on the upstairs walls. They argued with their insurance company about repairs that it insisted needed to be paid out of pocket before they could be reimbursed.
Dunn initially took shelter with a nearby friend, whose power then went out. They then stayed in a vacant apartment at UK, where they work, and then at a Holiday Inn hotel where they worked part-time.
Even nine years later, they still remember the storm as "the worst thing that ever happened to me."
Pets had a hard time, too
Erin Miller, owner of The Crushed Violet Fragrance Boutique, was living with their husband and their cat in a bungalow on Richmond Avenue. Miller said that after the ice storm, hotels — "even the shady ones," they said — were full. A relative took in the couple, along with their cat, who had to live in the garage. But they escaped, taking Miller and their husband on a two-hour quest. They found them a block over and several houses down.
Let us praise vent-free fireplaces
Some people managed to stay cozy in at least a room or two of their homes, thanks to the ventless gas fireplaces that reflected heat back into the room. Some others discovered that their vented gas fireplace was largely decorative.
"There are a fair amount of people who still remember that event," said Ryan Ball, service manager at Denger's Hearth, Patio & Grill in Nicholasville.
Stores such as Denger's saw a boom in sales of ventless gas fireplaces right after the ice storm. The store has largely stopped selling heat-free vented gas logs, Ball said.
How did people pass the time?
Nine months after the great ice storm of 2003, Central Baptist Hospital saw a 10 percent increase in births. UK Chandler Hospital reported an increase of 25 percent in October 2003.
Develop and publish decentralized applications worldwide with ease. Crypti brings the possibilities of blockchain based applications to a whole new level.
The Crypti Foundation, the team behind the next generation cryptocurrency Crypti, today announced the final release of their eagerly anticipated decentralized application (Dapp) platform, and officially opened its Crypti based Dapp Store to the general public. Today's release concludes a preliminary open beta testing period, and thus brings the JavaScript based decentralized application (Dapp) platform, including Dapp Store, actually onto the main Crypti network.
Code named “Gaia”, after the Greek goddess and historically referred to as “the great mother of all”, the newly released platform equips the cryptocurrency with the unique ability to host all manner of decentralized applications (Dapps), each with their own customizable sidechain.
Aimed at facilitating simplified development of decentralized applications (Dapps), without the need for a deeper understanding of blockchain based technology, each application on the new platform is written using the JavaScript programming language, and runs within a self-contained Node.js based virtual machine environment.
Accompanying today's release, comes the official opening of the Crypti Dapp Store, providing users with the ability to browse, search, and launch decentralized applications (Dapps), quickly and easily from within the web based Crypti client. The Crypti Dapp Store additionally provides a simple and efficient publication process, allowing developers to upload decentralized applications (Dapps) within a matter of minutes. Plus, thanks to an ongoing partnership between the Crypti Foundation and Sia - the decentralized storage network. The Crypti Dapp Store also gives developers the option of hosting the application source code on the Sia blockchain.
Combined with many bug fixes, performance and user-interface enhancements, the updated Crypti Client also adds Multi-Signature functionality, allowing accounts who choose to enable it, the ability to specify one or more supplementary accounts, as the required signers for every transaction made from an account.
In order to demonstrate the platform's shallow learning curve to new developers, the Crypti Foundation has written various tutorials, giving step-by-step instructions on how to build Crypti based decentralized applications (Dapps), all of which can be completed within a short space of time. The Crypti Foundation is also currently running a lucrative hackathon contest for the best voted decentralized application (Dapp). Further details of the contest, including tutorials and documentation, can be found on the official Crypti website.
The Crypti Foundation's Community Manager, Max Kordek said: “Owing to a successful beta period, during which a rigorous amount of testing was performed. Today we are ecstatic to announce the release of our beloved decentralized application platform.”
Kordek added: “After literally pouring our hearts and souls into Crypti's new platform, we at the Crypti Foundation, are all very much looking forward to seeing what kind of decentralized applications, developers will upload to the Crypti Dapp Store.”
Kordek further added: “Today's release is a critical point on our road map to a decentralized success story. We hope, therefore, it is now clear to all. Crypti brings the possibilities of blockchain based applications to a whole new level.”
About Crypti
Crypti is a blockchain 2.0 technology dedicated to allowing fast, easy, and cost effective deployment of decentralized applications (Dapps). By utilizing Node.js and incorporating consensus, hosting, storage, and compute modules into the core technology, along with a custom built decentralized application store, Crypti is able to provide a complete solution for the entire Dapp development cycle.
Researchers at Northwestern University have used Blu-ray discs — of Jackie Chan's seminal Police Story 3: Supercop, to be exact — to increase the efficiency of solar panels by a massive 22%.
This one's a bit crazy, but stick with me. Blu-ray discs, like CDs and DVDs before them, consist of a thin layer — or layers — of recording medium sandwiched between two bits of plastic. Data is stored on this medium in a series of pits — small indentations — that are about 75nm long. To read the data, a laser is bounced off the recording medium — where the medium is smooth and untouched (usually referred to as islands), the laser light bounces straight back into a sensor; where the pits are, the laser is reflected differently. Thus, binary data can be stored and read.

As it turns out, these two characteristics — a quasi-random pattern, repeating every 150 to 525nm — are almost perfectly tuned for trapping photons in the visible light and near-infrared spectrum. One of the main reasons that current solar cells aren't that efficient is because many photons simply reflect off the panel, rather than being converted into electrons. You can probably see where this is going.
To increase the efficiency of a solar panel by 22%, the researchers at Northwestern bought a copy of Police Story 3: Supercop on Blu-ray; removed the top plastic layer, exposing the recording medium beneath; cast a mold of the quasi-random pattern; and then used the mold to create a photovoltaic cell with the same pattern. As you can see in the image above, this process actually makes the nanopatterned solar cell have the same iridescence as a Blu-ray disc. [Research paper: doi:10.1038/ncomms6517]
The end result is a solar panel that has a quantum efficiency of around 40% — up about 22% from the non-patterned solar panel. As you can see in the graph above, the nanopatterning increases the solar panel's absorption and efficiency across the entire range of 400-700nm wavelengths (visible to near infrared).
Moving forward, can we expect the price of mediocre Jackie Chan movies to soar? Probably not. Any Blu-ray disc should work — and anyway, the more important takeaway here is that we should start nanopatterning our solar panels immediately. It just so happens that taking a mold of a Blu-ray disc is a cheap and easy way to get your hands on a good quasi-random nanopattern — but in the future, the patterning could be produced directly, without the Blu-ray intermediate.
Or, alternatively, if AOL starts using Blu-ray discs for its free trials, maybe we could finally fix the world's reliance on fossil fuels…

Consensus four-star cornerback Chris Lammons has committed to play for South Carolina in college. Lammons, a top prospect from Florida, also had scholarship offers from the likes of Alabama, Florida State, Florida, Ohio State, Miami, Arkansas, Ole Miss, and Tennessee. Their final choice for the former Florida commit came down to the Gamecocks and Badgers.
The 5'10, 172-pounder played their high school ball at Plantation High School in Ft. Lauderdale.  They are the No. 205 overall prospect in the class, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings, as well as the No. 21 player at their position and the No. 28 player in Florida.
SB Nation's Bud Elliott scouted Lammons:
Lammons is really, really athletic. He's also quite raw, given that they play quarterback for their high school team. Living in Florida, I've been lucky enough to see them play cornerback at several 7-on-7 events, and have come away very impressed. One of Lammons' best attributes is their quickness.  They are able to reach top speed almost immediately, which helps to cut down on receiver separation. Their speed is good, but is not in the elite or track category. While I haven't measured, Lammons' arms, they do appear longer than those of a typical 5'9.5/5'10 cornerback recruit. They have wide shoulders and should be able to play at at least 185 pounds. There are still some questions remaining about Lammons. I haven't seen them flip their hips like an elite cornerback. I also don't know anything about their instincts to this point as a defensive back, because the 7-on-7 former doesn't lend itself to that. The same goes for tackling. Lammons could benefit from a redshirt at the BCS level, but could also be a solid special teams contributor and perhaps a threat in the return game early on in their career.
Of the major services, Scout rates them the lowest, placing them at No. 256 overall and 29th at their position. ESPN and Rivals both consider Lammons a top-15 athlete in the class, and ESPN also considers them the No. 86 overall prospect.

Twenty-two-year-old Steinmayr was one of 17 competitors taking part in the Valencian city's annual World Championship Extreme Base Jumping Competition.
The experienced base jumper, who had already completed a successful leap from Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Tower at 320 metres, started losing control soon after jumping off Benidorm's Hotel Bali, Europe's tallest hotel standing at 210 metres.
As soon as Steinmayr opened their parachute, they were propelled back towards the skyscraper.
The Austrian managed to land on their feet on one of the building's upper floors and quickly attempted to complete their jump by pushing themselves off the ledge towards the void.
But the move worked against her, and within seconds Steinmayr was again heading towards the building with no control over their landing.
By a twist of luck, they went legs first through the glass window of a balcony on the tenth floor, narrowly escaping the concrete beams on either side.
Miraculously, the 22-year-old base jumper only suffered bruises to their elbows, knees and the nose.
Base jumping is an activity where participants jump from fixed objects and use a parachute to break their fall.
The acronym BASE stands for four categories of fixed objects from which a competitor can jump:buildings, antennas, spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).
Story highlights Three peace activists face trial this week for breaching a nuclear weapons site
The incident last year took place at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee
If convicted, they could face 20 years in prison
When an elderly nun and two fellow peace activists walked undetected onto one of the nation's most secure nuclear facilities last year, they wanted to call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons.
Yet their actions in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, triggered a very different concern:
If three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto the Y-12 National Security Complex -- once considered the "Fort Knox" for highly enriched uranium -- just how safe are the nation's nuclear weapons facilities from terrorists?
Sister Megan Rice, 83; Greg Boertje-Obed, 57; and Michael Walli, 63, will stand trial this week on federal charges of destroying U.S. government property, depredation against federal property exceeding $1,000, trespassing and injuring national-defense premises.
The three activists are accused of defacing property at the Oak Ridge nuclear facility.
The last charge alone carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The trial began Tuesday at federal court in Knoxville, Tennessee, according to WATE, CNN's affiliate in Knoxville
In the predawn hours of July 28, 2012, Rice, Boertje-Obed and Walli walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside, approaching a chain-link fence surrounding the Oak Ridge nuclear facility.
Armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter, they cut their way through the fence, fully expecting to be arrested on the spot.
Instead, they walked nearly a mile, cutting through four fences in all, breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country.
"When we got to the very high security fence where there's a lethal force authorized ... I thought, maybe we should turn around," Boertje-Obed told CNN's David Mattingly.
But they didn't. Hours later, the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners, spray-painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium
Since the incident, Congress has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs Y-12 and seven other nuclear weapons sites.
Map: Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, TN
Today, changes at Y-12 are noticeable. A new security contractor is in charge. New signs and security fences are going up.
While last year's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at Y-12, a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the Sandia National Laboratories said they don't think the nation's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk.
"Once they got in, they could spray paint things, but it's just like if you got into Fort Knox, you wouldn't know the combination to the locks."
Allen said the country's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites around the country that are "usually out in the middle of nowhere" to protect against threats.

"There's really only one place where the weapons are fully assembled; I'm not going to tell you which one," Allen said. "And the reason there are eight places, they don't want people to have the full knowledge (of what the other facilities do).
"We almost never see an assembled nuclear weapon."
But another nuclear security expert said the Y-12 breach was more than just trespassing by a few environmental protesters.
"This was a very serious incident because they penetrated the protected area, and that's when there was supposed to be an immediate security response," said Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist with Global Security Program , a watchdog group that monitors the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
"If they had been trained, the kind of paramilitary group that the Department of Energy is supposed to be ensuring they can protect against, with hand-carried explosives, other breaching tools, physical access to the building structure ... the guards would have already lost."
Lyman said the breach was not an isolated incident.
"It was a result of this reduced central oversight, giving contractors more responsibility for supervising themselves, and that's an invitation of corner-cutting and complacency to set in," they said.
The incident not only broke the public's trust that the government is "exercising good oversight" of its nuclear weapons facilities, according to Lyman, but they said it also has "global implications."
"If we can't even control our own nuclear weapons material, it shows what a major challenge it is around the world ... that have comparably dangerous materials but are even less protected.
And, Lyman pointed out, if the United States appears to have vulnerabilities in protecting its nuclear weapons material, "then that not only reduces our authority to criticize other countries, it's raising questions about the integrity of our own security. "
Canadian scientists have found a way to analyze air from the ancient Earth's atmosphere that was trapped in salt crystals nearly a billion years ago.
What they found may have implications for the origin of complex life.
The air, which has been preserved, undisturbed, in tiny pockets in the crystals for about 815 million years, appears to contain 10.9 per cent oxygen — just half the amount in the atmosphere today.
But it's about five times more than scientists expected for that time period, which is about 200 million years before the first known multicellular fossils.
"I'm surprised and excited," said Nigel Blamey, a professor of earth sciences at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., who co-led the study with fellow Brock geochemist Uwe Brand.

Brand says the discovery answers a key question about the evolution of complex life — did animals arise before or after the oxygen needed to support larger, more complex organisms?
"And now with our research and our result, we know there was sufficient oxygen before they arose," they said, adding that the higher oxygen levels would have allowed animals to diversify and become more complex.
That means it may be possible to find multicellular fossils older than the oldest that are currently known.
"Now paleobiologists will have reason to go looking for rocks with original traces of these first evolutionary steps," Brand said.
The team's results are published in the journal Geology.
Trapped bubbles
When salty water called brine evaporates from a shallow pool, it forms crystals of salt called halite — very similar to the kind we sprinkle on our food. In the process, it often traps tiny bubbles of fluid or air from the atmosphere at the time it forms.
That happened in the Officer Basin in southwestern Australia about 815 million years ago, during a geological era called the Neoproterozoic. The halite was subsequently buried and preserved under about a kilometre of sediment.
Nigel Blamey has built a geochemical analysis machine that is unique in the world. It can crush tiny samples of rock as small as a tenth of a gram, and measure, identify and compare minute quantities of the gas released from tiny pores in the rock, using a device called a mass spectrometer. (Brock University)
For the study, researchers removed the deeply buried samples using a drill core. While it wasn't chemically possible to directly measure the age of the salt, the layers on either side of it contained radioactive isotopes of elements such as uranium that decay at a very specific rate. Those measurements showed that the layers on either side of the salt were 800 million and 830 million years old, suggesting the salt was in between those ages.
Unique machine
The samples were taken back to the lab where Blamey has built a geochemical analysis machine that is unique in the world. It can crush tiny samples of rock as small as a tenth of a gram, and measure, identify and compare minute quantities of the gas released from tiny pores in the rock using a device called a mass spectrometer. The device has previously been used to detect methane trapped in meteorites from Mars, among other things.
The team took multiple samples of ancient Australian halite, crushing each one four to 10 times and measuring the gas that was released.
"They all gave us very similar results."
When halite forms, it often traps tiny bubbles of fluid or air from the atmosphere at the time. That air can remain trapped for hundreds of millions of years. (Brock University)
The researchers also compared salt samples from other halite deposits of different ages — including the modern day — when oxygen concentrations were known and found their results matched up with known concentrations. That gave them confidence in their result, they said.
Scientists had previously estimated that the Earth's atmosphere contained just two per cent oxygen during the Neoproterozoic. Blamey said that was largely based on geochemical measurements of marine sediments — located deep underwater, far from the atmosphere itself — combined with computer modelling, leaving lots of room for error and incorrect assumptions.
"They're using an indirect method," they said. "We're using a direct measurement and we're measuring from a mineral that has actually trapped atmosphere. It's a huge step forward, really."
Blamey and Brand collaborated with co-authors from the U.S., Scotland, France and China who helped provide samples from different time periods from around the world, and provided input about their analysis. The study was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Because there are real doubts that presumed GOP nominee Mitt Romney has what it takes to displace the current White House occupant in the general election, there are some Republicans who have a message for the delegates to the forthcoming GOP National Convention: Dump Romney and nominate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas).
In stark contrast to outspoken populist Paul, whose integrity is undoubted, whose finances and business affairs are an open book and whose political message has been consistent, Romney can't shake the image of being an out-of-touch elitist who flip-flops on the issues and whose business affairs seem sordid and un-American.
Paul supporters are also conscious of the danger a Romney presidency would pose to the future of the burgeoning “Ron Paul movement” (RPM) that emerged during the past four years.
As president, Romney would be in absolute control of the Republican Party national apparatus and would assuredly do everything in their power to quash any efforts by the RPM to expand its influence in GOP ranks. Romney is a fervent globalist whose allies in high places despise and fear the nationalist, non-interventionist sentiments of Paul and their supporters.
Four—or eight—years of a Romney presidency would put the kibosh on efforts by the RPM to reform the GOP from within and bend the party away from the New World Order orientation of Romney and the nest of discredited Bush-era neoconservatives who are back again and now running Romney.
But Paul's supporters have hopes of displacing Romney—even at this last minute—in Paul's favor.
A lot of Americans are not dazzled by the fact that Romney has been a business success, particularly since their monetary triumph through their Bain & Company operation came through shutting down American corporations, looting their assets and “outsourcing” American workers' jobs overseas. Even conservative Texas Governor Rick Perry described Romney as a “vulture capitalist.”
Romney has also been dogged by questions arising from their refusal to release anything other than only a very limited number of their recent income tax returns. Romney is known to have stashed money in overseas bank accounts. This has raised further concerns, causing some to wonder if Romney has other unreported sources of income.
That the Obama Justice Department is waging a quiet but aggressive inquiry into Americans who have hidden money in Israeli banks—including Bank Leumi (control of which was purchased by a consortium of Jewish financiers who use GOP former Vice President Dan Quayle as their frontman)—has led to speculation the inquiry is looking for further evidence of financial shenanigans by Romney stemming from their Israeli connections.
A longtime friend and former business associate of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Romney installed an Israeli woman with high-level Israeli military and intelligence connections, Orit Gadiesh, as chair of Bain, the entity at the center of the controversy surrounding Romney's wheeling and dealing.
What remains to be seen surrounding Romney's mysterious ventures is enough to make victory-minded Republicans uneasy. That's why supporters of Paul urge the GOP to dump Romney and pick the one GOP contender who can unquestionably draw clear lines of demarcation between themselves and the Democratic incumbent—and win the presidency on 2012.
Billionaire Bilderberger Backed Paul
By Michael Collins Piper
A strange item has been making the rounds relating to the beloved GOP Texas populist Representative Ron Paul. Following the recent meeting in Virginia of the Bilderberg group, many of Paul's supporters were rocked by an unexpected revelation.
It turns out that the billionaire founder of the online financial organization PayPal, Peter Thiel—an outspoken libertarian—who donated $2.7M to a superPAC supporting Paul's presidential campaign, not only showed up at Bilderberg, but Paul's biggest backer was actually one of Bilderberg's key members, serving on the “steering committee” of the secretive clique of bankers, industrialists, press lords and others who meet
yearly under the auspices of the Rothschild dynasty and their junior partners, the Rockefellers.
So while some at Bilderberg don't wish Paul well, at least one thinks highly of him. Even within Bilderberg there are differences of opinion.
Just after Bilderberg, Paul's increasingly errant son, Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.), distressed many by endorsing Mitt Romney, a fervent internationalist, unlike the senior Paul. While some think young Paul was threatened, others say that's unlikely: A little opposition to their overall plans only strengthens the appearance of democracy.
New Scandal: The Target of Obama's Grand Jury
By Michael Collins Piper
Both supporters and opponents of President Obama are concerned about negative political repercussions likely to arise from an ongoing high-level criminal investigation.
It is not widely known that the Obama administration's attorney general, Eric Holder, has upset some powerful people by launching a federal grand jury inquiry into wealthy Americans who have, according to a June 19 report from CNBC, “hidden money in Israel, many for generations” in violation of U.S. tax laws.
Two of Israel's biggest banks—Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim—are reportedly central to the inquiry and note that in 2008 the Israeli government's controlling interest in Leumi was purchased by Cerberus, the Wall Street syndicate run by Stephen Feinberg, described by Israel's Ha'aretz as “a New York Jew with a golden touch.”
Perhaps not coincidentally, two top Republicans—former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former Vice President Dan Quayle—have links to Cerberus. Rumsfeld was investing in Cerberus, which profited from the Iraq war Rumsfeld promoted, as far back as 2001, whereas Quayle is Feinberg's frontman—the chairperson of the board.
This controversial criminal investigation comes precisely when Obama's GOP opponent Mitt Romney—a close friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—is waging an aggressive bid for the support in terms of campaign money and votes from wealthy American Jews.
Romney is not aiming for support from Forbes 400 billionaires, but from that second tier of multimillionaires who follow, a substantial percentage of whom are Jewish and quite influential in their respective states where polls show Obama has lost support in the traditionally Democratic Jewish base—perhaps enough to cost them key states in the Electoral College.
In a carefully crafted article, The New York Times of June 20 telegraphed the nature of Romney's fundraising, noting the GOP candidate is focusing on those interested in “Israel, education and energy.” Driving home the point, the Times wrapped up the article by reiterating that “the campaign has organized much of its outreach around issues that energize contributors, like Israel,” citing praise for Romney from Philip Rosen, “a Romney donor active in Jewish causes.”
More subtly, the Times said Romney's targeted contributors are “midlevel millionaires,” those who “run dry cleaning chains and small industrial companies” and “car dealership owners,” realms where Jewish donors are prominent.
In case of any doubt about their loyalties, when the GOP candidate held a gathering for big donors at an exclusive retreat in Utah, visitors were addressed by columnist William Kristol. The well-known commentator is a longtime advocate for Romney's friend Netanyahu and longtime functionary of the Rupert Murdoch media empire bankrolled by the Rothschild family (whose own Lady Lynn de Rothschild is a fervent Obama critic and Romney supporter).
The prime mover behind the selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate in 2008, Kristol touts retiring Senator Joe Lieberman (a close McCain friend) as the likely secretary of state in a Romney administration, replacing Hillary Clinton.
Those who favor a “muscular” American foreign policy and military ventures abroad—a far cry from the nationalism and non-interventionism advocated by Representative Ron Paul—would be pleased by Lieberman at the State Department helm.

When Adam Scott rolled in a 12-foot birdie putt to win the Masters on Sunday, I heard The Voice. I hear it a lot when I'm watching sports. The Voice warns me that what's exciting (a Scott–Angel Cabrera playoff) often obscures what's morally revolting (a golf club with a lengthy history of racism and sexism). The Voice tells me I ought to cheer less and think more. The funny thing was, on Sunday, The Voice wasn't coming from Taylor Branch, Dave Zirin, or any of the usual suspects. It was coming from Bob Costas.
On Friday, Costas went on Dan Patrick's radio show and walloped CBS's coverage of the Masters:
What no CBS commentator has ever alluded to, even in passing, even during a rain delay, even when there was time to do so, is Augusta's history of racism and sexism. Even when people were protesting just outside the grounds — forget about taking a side — never acknowledging it. So not only would I never work the Masters because I'm not at CBS, but I'd have to say something and then I would be ejected.
Now, Costas wasn't breaking new ground by calling Augusta National a corrupt institution. (The New York Times was accused of overdoing the point a decade ago.) But slamming the TV people — saying they'd prostrated themselves before golf officials — was pretty interesting. It wasn't just Costas taking a swipe at Jim Nantz. It was Costas denouncing the kind of sportscaster they used to be.
To appreciate the transformation, you have to understand the Bob Costas of the 1980s. When they were hired by NBC, at the ripe age of 27, Costas had smarts, a deadpan delivery, and an encyclopedic memory of baseball that would rival Keith Olbermann's. For a play-by-play man, that might have been enough. But as Costas ascended to become the host of hosts — of the Olympics, NBA Showtime, The NFL on NBC, and Later — some of us began to wonder what was behind that happy mug. Did they ever think uncomfortable thoughts about sports or was they just the best at throwing it to Marv Albert and Mike Fratello?
In 1989, Sports Illustrated noted that Costas's idea of a controversial stand was reaming out an umpire for a blown call. Costas's reply was telling. They explained to a crowd at a sports editors luncheon, “Nobody in their right mind wants to turn on the Game of the Week or a football game on Sunday and hear someone preach to them about all of the ills of the NCAA, or about everything that's wrong with sports in America.” Costas wasn't putting away all their journalistic tools. They were saying when the network promises the Game of the Week, it should deliver the Game of the Week, minus the politics.
It's worth noting this was an attitude shared by most sportscasters. Even Howard Cosell, the model of a TV muckraker, was usually happy to entertain on Monday Night Football. He'd save the real digs for their radio commentaries or their magazine show, ABC SportsBeat.
By the 1990s, Costas was starting to get restless. They joined the big brains (John Thorn, Stephen Jay Gould) on Ken Burns's Baseball miniseries. They blurbed more than 50 books and wrote one of their own. “I've learned that calling a ball game is not the time for an extended examination of baseball's economics, or all the ways that the wild card alters our perception of the regular season,” Costas wrote in Fair Ball. The book would be a chance to break free of TV's cheerleading, to dig in and take some whacks.
But the book Costas produced was “a fan's case for baseball.” (The italics were his.) It was a wonky tract that argued the beleaguered sport could be saved. Even though Costas stumped for ideas Don Fehr and Bud Selig hated — a cap on player salaries, more radical revenue sharing — it wasn't a book that was going to get Fehr or Selig to stop returning theirs calls.
Beginning in 1995, Costas had a telling series of encounters with New York Times sports columnist Robert Lipsyte. Lipsyte was the anti-Costas. Their Times editor once said they were “on the peninsula” — meaning they ventured out on ground others wouldn't. As Lipsyte wrote in their memoir, they and Costas argued about just what it meant to be a sports journalist. Costas told Lipsyte they should let go and cheer once in a while. Lipsyte countered that Costas hadn't used their Q rating to stump for change. It was like seeing two distinct career paths carved out, one leading straight down the middle of the fairway and the other into heavy rough.
It was also clear Costas wanted gravitas. They proceeded in fits and starts. In 2007, Costas went on their radio show and called George W. Bush's presidency a “tragically failed administration.” A year later, when they sat next to Bush at the Beijing Olympics, Costas quizzed them on China's human-rights record and Russia's invasion of Georgia. Blogger Matthew Yglesias said Costas's interview was better than what you usually see on Meet the Press.
The 2012 Olympics showed the twin impulses tugging at Costas. During NBC's coverage of the parade of nations, they cracked jokes about Idi Amin and Borat. A British paper lumped them in with #NBCFail. Yet when the Israeli team entered, Costas zinged the International Olympic Committee for not properly honoring the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre. Costas then observed their own 12 seconds of silence on-air. It was a stunt Cosell would have been proud to call their own.
After Jovan Belcher's murder-suicide in December, Costas ventured further out on the peninsula. He'd read a column on gun culture by Jason Whitlock, was moved by it, and decided to add their own heft and platform. I was watching Sunday Night Football. I usually interpret the halftime code words — i.e., “revealing interview” — as a cue to find something on the Internet. But as Costas skewered the cliché of “putting it all in perspective,” as they suggested the real problem was Belcher having a gun, I found myself glued to the TV. Costas was like an earnest version of Jon Stewart. They later told Whitlock that they chose to speak out on Sunday Night Football, rather than their NBC Sports Network show, to ensure a maximum audience.
Costas wobbled a little the next day, saying they hadn't expressed their full, nuanced position because of time constraints. (When they wobbled again Friday on Bill Maher's Real Time, Maher said, “For fuck's sake, you're not running for president!”) But Costas also nuked the idea that they couldn't talk about politics during a big game. “If I had come on and said, ‘Well, it was a tragedy in Kansas City but let's not misunderstand: Only people commit murders, guns do not, etc., etc.,' then they would have stood up and applauded me,” Costas said of their critics. “And there wouldn't have been anything about how inappropriate it was to interject politics, as they see it, into halftime.”
They added, “To launch personal attacks, or to say it's not appropriate to make these remarks, I mean, I don't pay any attention to that.” Notice that this declaration is an about-face from their line back in 1989.
When they took on CBS last week, Costas dug in even deeper. After pointing out the network's indifference to Augusta's sleazy history, they said:
I think that somebody should have had the guts to do it at some point along the way. Broadcaster, executive, somebody should have said to someone at Augusta, ‘Look, this is an issue. And this is not Nightline or Meet the Press, we understand that. But this is an issue. And it's an elephant in the room. And we're going to address it as concisely as we can but we're going to address it so that our heads are not in the collective sand trap.
And Jim Nantz gasped, “Et tu, Costas?”
Now, Charles P. Pierce has noted that Costas's gun-control spiel is hardly the work of a leftist. And merely calling Augusta discriminatory is no longer revolutionary, if it ever was. I'd just note there's a value in repeating the basic facts of the case. If the reminder comes from someone with Costas's massive audience, all the better. That's how The Voice gets into our heads, and how it stays there even when the golf gets exciting.
Police arrest 5 more activists for feeding homeless
The members of the group Food Not Bombs were ladling out corn on the cob, rice, beans and watermelon to about 35 people when they were handcuffed. About two dozen activists and homeless people booed and chanted "Food is a right, not a privilege" as they were loaded into a waiting police van.
Orlando police arrested five more activists from behind a makeshift buffet table at Lake Eola Park on Wednesday evening, bringing to a dozen the number charged in the past week with violating city restrictions on feeding the homeless.
They were violating a controversial city ordinance that prohibits sharing food with large groups in a downtown city park more than twice a year. Food Not Bombs has been fighting the ordinance but lost a legal appeal in April, clearing the way for the city to begin enforcement.
The five arrested — Nick Emery, Tommy Frain, Thomas Hellinger, Kyle Trailies and Fischer Williams — ranged in age from 17 to 27.
The arrests follow four on Monday and three last week. Despite the arrests, Food Not Bombs members say they'll continue their twice-weekly feedings at Orlando's signature park to bring attention to what they consider an unjust law.
The local members are getting support from like-minded activists outside the city, as well. Two of those arrested, Emery and Frain, are members of a Food Not Bombs chapter in Tarpon Springs.
"It's important for people to come out and risk arrest and do whatever it takes," Emery said. "Food is a right."

NEW YORK/ATLANTA (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc and American Airlines vowed on Wednesday to fight the federal government's anti-trust lawsuit in court by arguing their proposed $11 billion merger would promote competition.

The U.S. Department of Justice, six state attorneys general and the District of Columbia challenged the proposed merger on Tuesday saying the creation of the world's largest airline that would result would stifle competition, drive up airfares and reduce services.
To underline their determination to fight for the merger, the airlines introduced their three high-powered lawyers who said they would argue the proposed deal would promote competition.
The lawsuit, filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, is likely to delay final approval of the bankruptcy exit plan of American Airlines' parent company, AMR Corp, which is still planned for Thursday. It also is almost certain to delay, if not derail, the merger, which the airlines had expected to conclude next month.
The lawyers said the U.S. government's case, laid out in a 56-page complaint, was weak.
“If they are going to convince the court that the sky is falling, which essentially is what they are trying to do here, they are going to have more meat than they've shown us so far,” said Joe Sims, a partner with Jones Day who was hired by American Airlines. Sims was lead counsel in the $13 billion merger of XM Satellite Radio Holdings and Sirius.
US Airways hired Richard Parker, a partner with O'Melveny & Myers LLP who is a former director of the Federal Trade Commission's competition bureau, and Paul Denis, a partner with Dechert LLP.
Parker said the government “got this one very wrong. Both of these companies are looking forward with confidence to our day in court.”
Denis, a veteran antitrust lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's antitrust division, represented Medco Health Solutions in securing clearance for the company's $29.1 billion merger with Express Scripts last year.
American, based in Fort Worth, Texas and US Airways, based in Tempe, Arizona, would be weaker rivals if the merger did not take place, an outcome that would not be good for consumers who deserve more choices, the lawyers said.
The airlines said a merger would increase competition by adding a viable competitor to two dominant carriers, Delta and United Continental, both the result of recent megamergers.
“They will neither individually be as effective a competitor to United, Delta and Southwest and all the other smaller low-cost carriers that are in the industry today,” Sims said. Southwest acquired AirTran in 2011.
Airline executives and antitrust lawyers learned that the Department of Justice was suing to block the merger on Tuesday morning, Denis said.
The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had explained its concerns to the airlines and given them a chance to present their views.
“I don't think it was a surprise to the parties,” said Bill Baer, the head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division.
The government argues that the merger of US Airways Group and AMR would reduce the number of large U.S. airlines to three, and said past practices showed the major airlines “increasingly prefer tacit coordination over full-throated competition.”
Legal experts unconnected to the lawsuit said the government had a strong case.
“The government has a very good argument” because the cost of air travel has not come down, said David Newman, a partner at the New York law firm Day Pitney, which has represented international airlines.
Investors remained skittish about the deal. US Airways stock fell 1.2 percent to $16.17 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. AMR shares, which had been down nearly 17 percent, had recovered somewhat to end the day at $2.72, down 13.6 percent. Airline stocks fell about 6 percent after the lawsuit was filed on Tuesday, and were down 0.2 percent on Wednesday.
MIAMI (AP) — A former worker on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign claims in a lawsuit filed Monday that they abruptly grabbed them by the hand and planted an unwanted kiss on their face during a Florida meeting with staff and volunteers.
Alva Johnson, who lives in the Huntsville, Alabama area, contends in the federal lawsuit that Trump made the nonconsensual advance in August 2016 in Tampa, Florida. They say they “grasped their hand and did not let go“ and kissed them on the corner of their mouth as they turned slightly away.
“The forced and unwanted kiss was deeply offensive to Ms. Johnson,” the lawsuit says, adding that they suffered “emotional distress, psychological trauma, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of dignity, invasion of privacy and other damages.”
The lawsuit, also reported earlier Monday by The Washington Post and The New Yorker seeks unspecified money damages and an order preventing the president from “grabbing, kissing or otherwise assaulting or harassing women without prior express consent.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called Johnson's allegations fabricated and said other people who were there say it did not take place.

“This accusation is absurd on its face. This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,” Sanders said. At the time, Johnson's main job with the Trump campaign was to manage a fleet of recreational vehicles that served as traveling offices throughout Florida. According to the lawsuit, Trump visited one of these RVs in Tampa before a rally there when the unwanted kiss took place.
“He told them they knew they had been on the road for a long time and that they had been doing a great job. They also told Ms. Johnson that they would not forget about her, and that they were going to take care of her,” Johnson claims in the lawsuit.
Among those who allegedly witnessed the incident was Pam Bondi, at the time Florida's attorney general and a Trump supporter. The lawsuit contends that Bondi “glanced at Ms. Johnson and smiled” after the alleged unwanted kiss. Bondi did not immediately respond Monday to an email seeking comment.
Johnson's lawsuit also recounts at least a dozen similar allegations made by women against Trump and notes that they realized they were not alone after the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape emerged in October 2016 in which Trump brags about groping and kissing women without asking permission. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
A Florida lawyer who they contacted not long after the incident, Adam Horowitz, said Monday that “she was definitely in distress and not just about their job.” They also told Horowitz they were seeing a therapist.
Horowitz said what they didn't know at the time was that October 2016 was also the month Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were being paid off through then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, according to Cohen's sworn statements. Horowitz ultimately did not take the Johnson case.
Johnson, who is African-American, also claims in the lawsuit that they were paid less than their Trump campaign counterparts because of their race and gender.
“The campaign knew that it was underpaying Ms. Johnson relative to their white counterparts,” the lawsuit claims. Trump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany denied that claim. “The Trump campaign has never discriminated based on race, ethnicity, gender, or any other basis. Any allegation suggesting otherwise is off base and unfounded.”
"It's a key point to remember that we cannot under-warn. Failure to warn is not an option for us," said Dai Lin Wang, an oceanographer at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. "We cannot have a situation that we thought was no problem and then it's devastating. That just cannot happen."
Hundreds of thousands of people fled shorelines for higher ground Saturday in a panic that circled the Pacific Rim after scientists warned 53 nations and territories that a tsunami had been generated by the massive Chilean quake.
It was the largest-scale evacuation in Hawaii in years, if not decades. Emergency sirens blared throughout the day, the Navy moved ships out of Pearl Harbor, and residents hoarded gasoline, food and water in anticipation of a major disaster. Some supermarkets even placed limits on items like Spam because of the panic buying.
At least five people were killed by the tsunami on Robinson Crusoe Island off Chile's coast and huge waves devastated the port city of Talcahuano, near hard-hit Concepcion on Chile's mainland.
But the threat of monster waves that left Hawaii's sun-drenched beaches empty for hours never appeared - a stark contrast to the tidal surge that killed 230,000 people around the Indian Ocean in 2004 and flattened entire communities.
This time, waves of more than 5 feet were reported in Kahului Bay in Maui and in Hilo, on the eastern coast of Hawaii's Big Island, but did little damage. Predictions of wave height in some areas were off by as much as 50 percent.
In Tonga, where up to 50,000 people fled inland hours ahead of the tsunami, the National Disaster Office had reports of a wave up to 6.5 feet hitting a small northern island, with no indications of damage.
And in Japan, where authorities ordered 400,000 people out of coastal communities, the biggest wave was a 4-foot surge that hit the northern island of Hokkaido, flooding some piers.
A Japanese official admitted that the authorities may have been over-zealous in issuing their first major tsunami alert in more than 15 years for a wave that ended up causing almost no damage.
"The agency's tsunami forecasts turned out to be a bit too big. I'd like to apologise for the prolonged alerts," Yasuo Sekita, a Meteorological Agency official in charge of earthquakes and tsunamis, told a news conference.
But scientists offered no apologies for the warnings and defended their work, all while worrying that the false alarm could lead to complacency among coastal residents - a disastrous possibility in the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim.
A similar quake in Chile in 1960 created a tsunami that killed about 140 people in Japan. The same surge hit Hawaii and devastated downtown Hilo, on the Big Island, killing 61 residents and wiping out more than 500 homes and businesses.
"If you give too many warnings and none of them materialise, then you lose your credibility," Mr Wang said. "That's something that we have to deal with and we have to improve."
"I hope everyone learned from this for next time, and there will be a next time," said Gerard Fryer, a geophysicist for the warning center.
The science of predicting tsunamis is difficult, given the vast size of the ocean and the volatile forces at work miles below the surface.
Scientists use an earthquake's magnitude and location as the basis for their predictions and then refine it constantly with data from more than 30 deep-water sensors stationed across the Pacific as the shock wave sweeps across the ocean floor.
The sensors, located at 15,000 feet to 20,000 feet beneath the surface, measure the weight of the water and beam it to buoys floating on the surface. Scientists then use the data to calculate the tsunami's wave height in the open ocean as it progresses toward shallower waters.
You could almost hear the gasps from both sides of the ideological divide when President Trump unveiled the outline of their first budget late last month, proposing to slice $54 billion from the discretionary civilian budget next year to pay for a beefed-up defense.
That part of the budget pays for pretty much everything the government does other than the military, pensions and health insurance for older people. And it has been slashed repeatedly already. It adds up to only some $500 billion, hardly the best place to balance a $4 trillion federal budget. After Mr. Trump's proposed cuts it would be 25 percent smaller than it was in 2010, adjusted for inflation.
Even Republicans in Congress, no friends of government spending, argued that the math made little sense. While they share Mr. Trump's twin goals of balancing the budget and slashing taxes, they would prefer to square the circle by cutting the entitlements of Social Security and Medicare.
And yet Mr. Trump's approach possesses a powerful political logic: The frazzled, anxious working-class men and women who voted for them like Social Security, Medicare and defense. Other government spending, not so much. Notably, there is little political cost for Mr. Trump — in fact, potential benefit — in going after means-tested programs for the poor.
TORONTO — A win in Week 13 against the Edmonton Eskimos snapped the Toronto Argonauts' two-game losing skid and pulled themselves within one point of the top spot in the East Division.
James Wilder Jr. racked up over 200 all-purpose yards and their first career CFL touchdown in their team's win, helping to move Toronto up three spots in the Power Rankings.
The Saskatchewan Roughriders also moved up after a win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats thanks to an impressive performance from Canadian quarterback Brandon Bridge, but where did the rest land?

The Stampeders are pulling away from the rest of the pack in the West Division. After a win over the BC Lions last week, they now hold a five-point lead over the Bombers for the top spot. The team heads to Saskatchewan to take on the Riders this week looking to increase that lead.
This Week: 2 | Last Week: 2
Winnipeg is coming off of a Week 13 bye and will be ready to keep the momentum from its win over the Riders from Week 12 going. The Bombers will host the REDBLACKS this week and will have a chance to take advantage of a team without their starting quarterback.
This Week: 3 | Last Week: 4
Brandon Bridge had an excellent outing for the Riders in Week 13, helping their team defeat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Riders are now tied in points with the Lions as the fight for the crossover playoff spot is neck and neck. This week, Saskatchewan will take on the Stampeders hoping to be the team to snap Calgary's winning streak.
This Week: 4 | Last Week: 7
Toronto jumped three spots in the rankings this week after defeating the Edmonton Eskimos at home. They sit just one point behind the REDBLACKS in the East and getting a win over the Montreal Alouettes this week is important if they want to take over that top spot.
This Week: 5 | Last Week: 3
Since starting the season 7-0, the Eskimos have dropped their last five contests. Maybe it's the injuries catching up to them or maybe they've just hit a chord of bad luck but whatever it is, they'll have a week off to find a way to fix it. Edmonton heads into a Week 14 bye before returning in Week 15 to take on the Blue Bombers.

BHUBANESWAR: Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday attached `244.89 worth property of Balasore Alloys Limited, Odisha, for defrauding the State Trading Corporation (STC) by Global Steel Holding Limited. The central agency had earlier frozen shares worth over `62 crore in the name of Global Steel's chairperson, Pramod Kumar Mittal, in connection with its money laundering probe in the alleged fraud of over `2,100 crore with STC.
The agency had also registered a criminal case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Global Steel Holding, its chairperson Pramod Mittal and others based on an FIR by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The central agency had stated that the shares were frozen on the reasonable belief that the same were proceeds of crime involved in money laundering. CBI case had been registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the PSU - State Trading Corporation (STC). It was alleged that Mittal committed criminal breach of trust as they failed to make payments as per terms and conditions of the agreement with STC.
According to the complaint, the STC had arranged export of raw material for new steel plants of Global Steel Philippines Inc (GSPI) at the Philippines and Bosnia, and also opened a line of credit for the company.
The complaint also stated that despite irregular payments and piling up of credit, STC officials had renewed line of credit to the company.
CBI in its 19-page FIR had also named Lalit Sehgal, former chief executive officer of Global Steel Philippines Inc and 18 other accused, including former chairperson and managing director of the STC Arvind Padalai and 18 former executives of the PSU. Global Steel Holdings had approached STC in 2003 seeking assistance in financing facility by issuing Letters of Credit for purchasing raw materials required for their newly acquired steel plants.
The Government Digital Service (GDS) is “becoming sidelined” and its government-as-a-platform (GaaP) programme is “dead”, according to former Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who set up GDS in 2011.
Maude said the civil service has an “innovation-hostile culture” and a “bias to inertia”, during a speech at Speaker's House in Westminster on 12 September about the future of the civil service.
They called for a greater role for “strong functional leadership” for cross-Whitehall functions, such as IT and digital, pointing to the costs savings delivered under their tenure as proof such an approach works.
“Every department claims that what it does is completely unique and distinctive – and, of course, much is genuinely unique. But most of their requirements for property, IT and digital, procurement, HR [human resources], finance and project management are common to the whole of government,” said Maude.
“Even when they are not, you still need one place where there's a critical mass of technical expertise. Between 2010 and 2015, we led from the Cabinet Office an efficiency and reform programme that saved the taxpayer £19bn in 2014-15.”
Maude said attempts to build new central functions to coordinate across departments – such as GDS – were thwarted by “mandarins” and “heavily resisted by the HM Treasury”.
“For much of the mandarinate this was an assault on their autonomy and empires, and what we know about empires is that they fight back – and boy, are they fighting back,” they said.
“The mantra tends to be: ‘We definitely want to continue with the reforms. But they're now embedded in the departments, and it's definitely now safe to relax the central controls.' When you hear those words, you know that what they really mean is that the reforms are embedded six feet under, and that the departments are cheerfully going back to their old ways.
“So GDS, which became a model for other governments to follow – including in the US and Australia – is becoming sidelined and underpowered. The powerful and revolutionary idea of ‘government as a platform' is dead.”
GDS introduced a series of spending controls for digital projects under Maude, which the former minister has credited with saving billions of pounds. Those controls are being relaxed, with authority now returning to departments – much as Maude described in their speech.
They also cited the Major Projects Authority – set up to give central oversight of large government programmes, including IT – as another example of the benefits of taking control of common functions away from departments.
“The wrong thing was every part of government marking its own homework on the management of major projects, so that they were all said to be doing splendidly despite two-thirds running well over budget and timetable. Establishing the Major Projects Authority to provide consistent oversight, assurance and support nearly halved the failure rate,” they said.
Last year, Computer Weekly reported that senior civil servants wanted to break up GDS and return most of its responsibility for digital strategy to departments. GDS supporters have highlighted the relaxation of spend controls as a further diminishing of its central remit.
When the GaaP programme was first established, GDS identified at least 24 common digital services that could be developed as part of the plan. So far, just five of those are underway – Gov.uk Verify, for identity assurance; Pay for online payments; Notify for electronic notifications; platform as a service (PaaS); and establishing standard registers of data – and the roll-out to departments has been slow.
A further programme under GaaP – common technology services, to introduce better IT for civil servants – has effectively been mothballed.
Cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Jeremy Heywood, described Maude's comments as a “wholly inaccurate portrayal”.
“Since they left the Cabinet Office in 2015, the civil service reform programme that they helped to create has been implemented with vigour, sharply improving our commercial, financial and digital capacity,” said Heywood. Maude was Cabinet Office minister from 2010 to 2015.
When GDS's first director, Mike Bracken, quit in 2015, they cited a push to “revert back to mandarin-led lands of authority” over digital policy as a major factor in their decision to leave. Bracken was appointed by Maude and often highlighted the valuable role the minister played in giving political authority to support GDS.
The men behind the controls of the final Beatles album have spoken out about the tensions that led to the Fab Four's split, insisting a decision to wheel an injured bed-bound Yoko Ono into the studio was a terrible idea that could have marked the beginning of the end.
John Lennon's wife had been injured in a family car crash in Scotland and the Beatles star insisted they had to be with them at all times.
So a Harrods double bed was placed in the corner of the group's studio at Abbey Road and Ono watched the recording of what would be the group's final album, also called Abbey Road, as they recovered.
But engineer John Kurlander tells British music magazine Mojo it wasn't so much the bed in the studio that added to the tension in the studio, but the endless stream of visitors.
They explain, "My memory is not so much that it was curious that they were convalescing in a bed in the corner of the studio, but that they had them entourage... They had a lot of visitors
"It was on the studio floor, so if the guys were working on a song, it was distracting that they had so many people coming to see her."
Part-time tape operator Alan Parsons adds, "It was a strange atmosphere: Yoko in the bed in the studio, sending someone out to run errands and pick up food... and they and John would occasionally snuggle in there.
"I don't think there was any serious hanky-panky going on, but they would be side by side, like they would be in a hotel room... (But) it wasn't our place to comment."
Even Paul MCCartney, who agreed to be interviewed for the Mojo expose into the last months of the Beatles, has revealed the 'bed-in' was "surprising," adding, "We just had to work around them - and walk around them It was the madness of the times: you just had to put up with it. What could you do? You couldn't say, 'Get that bed out of here.' They were John's girl."
Lone Star is an American drama television series which originally ran on Fox from September 20, 2010 to September 27, 2010, airing Monday nights at 9 p.m. ET/PT. [2] Fox announced Lone Star 's cancellation on September 28, 2010 after two low-rated episodes. This was the first cancellation of the 2010-11 television season. [1]
Robert Allen ( James Wolk ), a Texan con-man, leads a secret double life. As "Bob", they are married to Cat and living in Houston while working for their oil-tycoon father-in-law. Four hundred miles away in Midland , they are "Robert" in a second life with girlfriend Lindsey. As they scheme to take control of the oil business and finds themselves torn between the love of two women, they must fight to keep their web of lies from falling apart. [3]
In October 2009, Fox made a script-plus-penalty commitment with writer Kyle Killen.[4][5] In mid-January 2010, Fox placed a cast-contingent pilot order under the working title Midland.[6] Marc Webb was signed to direct the pilot episode.[7] In early February, Amy Lippman, Chris Keyser, Kerry Kohansky Roberts, and Paul Weitz were all named as executive producers.[8]
Casting announcements began in mid-February 2010. James Wolk was the first actor cast, in the lead role of Robert Allen.[8] Next to sign on was Eloise Mumford, as Allen's girlfriend, Lindsay.[9] In March, Adrianne Palicki and Bryce Johnson were cast as siblings Cat and Drew Thatcher. Cat is married to Robert.[10] Jon Voight was cast as Clint Thatcher, and David Keith cast as John Allen, to portray the patriarchs of their respective families.[11] Mark Deklin and Hannah Leigh rounded out the main cast at the end of March.[12] Deklin filled the role of Trammell, an elder brother to Cat and Drew, while Leigh played Cat's daughter, Grace.
The pilot was filmed in Dallas, Texas, during the second half of March 2010.[13][14] Fox green-lit the project to series in mid-May under the new name Lone Star.[15] At the network's upfront presentation, Fox announced that the series would be part of the Fall 2010–11 television schedule, airing on Mondays at 9 pm.[3] The series was filmed in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas.[16] Lippman and Keyser served as showrunners for the series,[15] which began filming additional episodes in late July 2010.[17][18][19]
In August 2010, it was reported that Andie MacDowell and Rosa Blasi would join the cast.[20] Neither appeared in the two episodes broadcast on Fox.
WATCH: The federal government has promised to implement tighter regulations on salvia and it's finally taking actions. But as Laura Stone reports, critics say it's not the right approach.
OTTAWA – The Conservative government is expected to fulfill a four-year-old promise to add salvia to its list of controlled substances, Global News has learned.
After making the promise in 2011, Health Canada is set to add the sage specifies S. divinorum to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, making it illegal to possess, traffic and produce it.
READ MORE: Hallucinogenic salvia remains in legal limbo
“We've done our due diligence, we've done the studies, we know that these are used by young kids as hallucinogens,” Paul Calandra, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, said in an interview.
“They aren't healthy, they're not safe, and that's why we are moving to listing these as banned drugs.”
Salvia is found in a powerful Mexican plant that can cause hallucinations, memory loss and anxiety when smoked.
The high only lasts several minutes, and most people smoke it only once or twice, says Peter Addy, an associate research scientist at the Yale University School of Medicine.
“It hits you almost instantly. It crosses the blood brain barrier and it leads to a very intense and short-acting experience as opposed to eating or drinking it the way that it's used traditionally,” said Addy, who's been studying the drug for five years.
“It can be kind of anxiety- and fear-inducing if you do it under the wrong circumstances or if you're not really prepared for it.”
Salvia is currently regulated by Health Canada as a “natural health product” – but no one is licensed to sell it.
Years after an accident in British Columbia and a 2006 death in Delaware, the government says it is finally acting.
The Liberals say there isn't enough evidence to prove salvia is harmful or has long-term health effects.
“The problem about this government is that it makes decisions based on some kind of ideological whim, and not based on good evidence,” said health critic Hedy Fry.
The B.C. Civil Liberties Association says criminalizing salvia isn't the answer either.
“We don't protect youth by criminalizing them. Putting youth in jail for the use of this substance is clearly counter-productive,” said policy director Micheal Vonn.
But as the Conservatives gear up for the election, a source says salvia will be added to the list of controlled substances any day now.
There has been a significant increase, by about a third, in attacks on foreigners living in Germany. There has also been an increase by around a third in alleged non-German crime suspects. But this has not been adequately reflected in media reports this year, a new German study finds.
Surprisingly, media coverage focused on the latter rather than the former, says Thomas Hestermann, Macromedia Media School journalism professor and head of the study. "The media are more likely to spotlight violent perpetrators from abroad," they say.
The professor told DW that they and their team analyzed 283 articles from four leading national German newspapers and 81 TV news reports published and aired between January and April 2017.
More than 1,000 women reported they fell victim to sexual assaults on December 31,2105 in Cologne
They noted a complete reversal in media attention since the mass sex assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015/2016, which were tied to the huge influx of refugees.
Stark change in media attention
The media is - in varying degrees depending on the individual paper or broadcaster - generally taking a much "darker" view of the refugee situation these days, they say.
The most recent attack that made headlines in Germany involved a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum-seeker and alleged Islamist who stabbed one person to death, and injured several others, in a Hamburg supermarket. Federal prosecutors have taken charge of the investigation.
The Macromedia team found that compared to 2014, German news broadcasts this year aired four times as many reports on non-German crime suspects, even though criminal statistics show that crimes by non-German suspects have increased by a third.
Cliche of the violent migrant
Media attention to non-German crime suspects was already quite pronounced in 2007, Hestermann says. But they went on to say that this year, it has reached record proportions since the start of the long-term study.
The study found that broadcasters had 50 percent fewer reports about non-German victims of violence as compared to 2014. This is despite security authorities still recording attacks on refuge shelters. Sixty-four percent of reports about foreigners in Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper focused on those who were suspected of a crime.
Such coverage gives people a distorted impression, and can easily fuel prejudices, Hestermann warns. "People can get the idea that integration is one big mistake."
The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) only recently (2013) began to note the nationality of crime victims. It found that non-Germans are far more often the victims of violent crimes.
Add perspective
The media need to tell both sides of the story, "well- researched, honest - and they need to address failures and disappointments as well as success stories," Hestermann says.
In addition, the study found refugees themselves are rarely interviewed in any of the media that was researched. That might be due to language problems, they conceded, but was astonishing all the same. "Aren't German journalists curious?"
The Macromedia study comes on the heels of an earlier survey on the overall German media coverage during the period when around one million refugees made their way to Germany in 2015 and early 2016.
Uncritical mainstream media?
In July, a team of researchers at the Otto Brenner Institute published a critical study documenting massive media shortfalls, arguing that leading daily newspapers' coverage was one-sided and did not take an objective view of public policy.
Refugees and migrants arriving in Germany in September 2015 were enthusiastically welcomed
The mainstream media in fact applauded this new, welcoming side of the German public and government, and covered touching refugee stories, disregarding what many other Germans felt about the influx.
That study sifted through more than 30,000 newspaper reports and found journalists used what became known as the Willkommenskultur (welcoming culture) slogan to put moral pressure on citizens to contribute to the cause of helping refugees. According to the study, such coverage contributed to a loss of trust in the mainstream media.

The White House is pushing back at media reports saying dozens of states are refusing to hand over voters' private data.
Kris Kobach, the vice chairperson of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, said in a statement on Wednesday that 36 states had "either agreed or are considering" complying with the commission's request, which included providing it with voters' names, addresses, birthdays, political parties, last four Social Security number digits, and election participation records.
"While there are news reports that 44 states have 'refused' to provide voter information to the Commission, these reports are patently false, more 'fake news,'" the statement, issued on letterhead from the office of Vice President Mike Pence, said. Pence is the commission's chairperson.
"Despite media distortions and obstruction by a handful of state politicians, this bipartisan commission on election integrity will continue its work to gather the facts through public records requests to ensure the integrity of each American's vote because the public has a right to know."
The voting commission's request, sent to officials in all 50 states last week, specified to turn over only information that was publicly available.
Still, the request alarmed election officials across the US, and several states said they would not comply. According to The Nation's count, 20 states have refused to turn over any data, with some officials citing privacy concerns. Others accused the White House of using the panel to lend credence to President Donald Trump's baseless claim that millions of illegal votes were cast in last year's election.
Kobach seemed to arrive at their count of 36 states by combining states that agreed to turn over some publicly available information with states that had not responded to the request.
States that refused to provide the data span the political spectrum, from Alabama to California. Maryland's attorney general, Brian Frosh, said the commission's request was "designed only to intimidate voters and to indulge President Trump's fantasy that they won the popular vote." And Kentucky's secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes, said, "There's not enough bourbon here in Kentucky to make this request seem sensible."

WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans have insisted that no matter who President Barack Obama nominates for the Supreme Court, there will be no hearings, no votes, no nothing. But there may be one potential candidate that Republicans would have a hard time blocking: Obama could appoint constitutional law professor Barack Obama.
There's roughly a zero percent chance this'll happen, but here's why it makes sense: Appointing Obama would put the GOP in the position they've desperately wanted to be in since the man was inaugurated. They'd have the chance to vote them out of office. If he's truly as dangerous and illegitimate a president as Republicans say, then this is their opportunity to get them out of the White House by putting them on the court.
The move would also give Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell a chance to virtually guarantee that they remain Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (McConnell would have to persuade their colleagues not to filibuster.) Some of the most vulnerable Republicans would have their 2016 chances boosted by voting to confirm Obama. Sens. Pat Toomey (Pa.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) would be assured re-election if they could peel off a small portion of Democratic voters grateful for the bipartisan move.
With those four alone, Democrats would have 50 votes, a tie that could be broken by Vice President Joe Biden -- who would be all too pleased to cast the deciding vote to make themselves president, even if he'd become one of the shortest-serving presidents in history. And Biden, of course, would then name their longtime ally and Senate successor Ted Kaufman as vice president. If Biden happened to meet the same sudden fate as Antonin Scalia did, Kaufman could quickly go about the business of breaking up the banks.
White House aide Eric Schultz, asked if Obama had considered nominating Obama, noted that the president "has said he's not interested in being a Supreme Court justice," citing a New Yorker article by Jeffrey Toobin and a recent interview on Ellen.
Sure, Obama may have said that, but what if the president themselves called on them to serve? Wouldn't that change theirs thinking?
"The press corps is officially unhinged," Schultz suggested.
UPDATE: White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, asked at a Wednesday press briefing about Obama nominating Obama, did not rule it out.
"I haven't asked them that direct question, but I think all of the available evidence indicates that that option is highly unlikely," they said.

As the Minnesota Timberwolves consider the future of All-Star forward Kevin Love, Sam Mitchell has emerged as a serious candidate for the franchise's head coaching job, league sources told Yahoo Sports.
Mitchell left a good impression with Wolves president Flip Saunders in a recent meeting and has moved themselves into consideration for the job, league sources said.
Beyond the coaching search, the Wolves are under pressure to start considering trade scenarios for Love, who's anxious to exercise their early termination option (ETO) in the summer of 2015 and leave as a free agent, league sources said.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
"For the first time, [Saunders] sounds like looking at deals for [Love] is an option," one rival executive told Yahoo Sports.
The Boston Celtics, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns are among many teams determined to make hard runs at trades for Love, league sources said. Boston and Los Angeles plan to make high-lottery picks in the 2014 NBA draft available in offers for Love, sources said.
No team is likely to trade for Love without an assurance that he'll commit to a five-year, $100 million maximum contract extension. Despite a belief that Love prefers Los Angeles or New York as a potential destination, he's open to deals in other markets where they can be part of an immediate contender, sources said.
Nevertheless, Saunders has made finding a coach to help convince Love to reconsider free agency as a top priority, but the bigger issue for the All-Star forward comes with a roster that hasn't been talented enough to make the Western Conference playoffs.
Story continues
Minnesota probed several top college coaches, including Florida's Billy Donovan, Michigan State's Tom Izzo and Iowa State's Fred Hoiberg, sources said, but those coaches weren't inclined to seriously consider the Wolves job. The broad belief that the Wolves will have to trade Love has made coaches leery of the franchise's future.
Mitchell has a strong history with Saunders and Minnesota, where they had two stops as a player -- 1989-1992 and 1995-2002. Mitchell played for Saunders in their second stint.
As the Toronto Raptors coach for parts of five seasons, Mitchell reached the playoffs twice and won the NBA coach of the year award in 2007. After their firing into Toronto in 2010, they spent a season with the Nets as an assistant coach. He's been a television analyst and radio host since leaving the Nets in 2011.

Dozens of groups from across the political spectrum are urging Congress to reform the federal government's bulk surveillance practices as divisions emerge on Capitol Hill over how to handle those spy programs ahead of a June 1 deadline.
The groups oppose a proposal backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to renew the National Security Agency's current authority to conduct a daily dragnet of phone records and instead want changes written into the federal Patriot Act, such a those included in a bipartisan bill now moving through the House of Representatives. The groups signing a letter to congressional leaders Wednesday run the ideological gamut, from watchdogs like the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International to liberal groups such as the NAACP and People For the American Way and conservative organizations such as FreedomWorks and Gun Owners of America.
"Policymakers on both sides of the aisle, along with members of the public, have consistently urged Congress to take action to restore accountability, transparency, and faith in intelligence agencies," the letter reads. "Despite this, Congress has yet to enact meaningful reforms that would end bulk collection, preserve privacy, and protect human rights."
Congress has scheduled a little more than two weeks of work before the current law expires. The House is moving forward with a reform bill, known as the USA Freedom Act, that could get a final vote there as soon as next week. Senate leaders, however, have signaled that they do not plan to move as swiftly to implement reforms. Instead, McConnell said Tuesday they expect to take up complex trade legislation next week, with could leave limited time for consideration of any reforms before the deadline expires.
[With deadline near, lawmakers introduce bill to end NSA program]
In lieu of the reform bill, McConnell has co-authored a bill with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) that would reauthorize current bulk surveillance programs for five additional years without any reforms, and they have made preparations to bring that bill to a floor vote without committee consideration. Congressional opponents of the NSA's practices have said they fear McConnell's moves are calibrated to force Congress to act shortly before the deadline with limited time to debate new constraints.
McConnell on Tuesday said they intended to move forward with their own bill, not the House bill, though they signaled it would be open for amendment. "What I've said is we're going to try to do something to avoid expiration at the end of the month," they said. "Exactly how that plays out, will be determined, in part, by how much time is left to achieve it."
Democratic leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) urged McConnell to take up the House legislation as soon as it is passed. "The wise thing to do would be to pass that bill because I think there are significant votes in the Democratic and Republican caucuses here in the Senate to do just that," they said, adding that a "vast majority" of the Republicans "don't want an extension of the old bill; they want something new."
The groups strongly oppose the McConnell-Burr bill in Wednesday's letter, saying a flat renewal of the spying authority would "fail to address the deleterious impact that mass surveillance conducted under Section 215 continues to have on our privacy, economy, and democracy."
"In the absence of meaningful reform, it is unacceptable to rubber stamp reauthorization of an authority that the government has used to spy on millions of innocent Americans," the letter reads.
In addition to ending bulk surveillance of phone "metadata," which includes the numbers dialed, call times and durations, the House bill would require the nation's secretive surveillance court to provide a public summary or redacted version of significant opinions. It would also grant technology companies more leeway to report on the scale of national security requests for data they receive, and it would provide for an advocate for the public's privacy rights at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which generally hears only the government's side of an argument.

Founded in Denver in 1994, Great Divide is one of the most decorated breweries in America.
And while holding down the proverbial fort for two plus decades require consistency and continuity in product, branding and ethos, that doesn't mean a brewery doesn't enjoy putting things on the back burner and brewing up something new. Great Divide has announced their overhaul for 2017 beer releases, and sure, some things will take a hiatus, other gems will get a chance to shine. We're talking brand new year-round beers, changes to barrel-aged beers, new packaging options and new brews headed to cans!
But we don't just get to have new beers. Some of the OG GDBC stalwarts and tenured brews you may love will all be going on hiatus to the general public in 2017, to make way for the new line-up. Though we're sad to see them go, details that Great Divide has provided to us regarding the new beers prove that there are delicious goods filling in their places.
New Beers
Hop Disciples-Rotating Hop Project IPA – ABV: 6.2% | AVAILABLE: Jan-April
Hop Disciples takes a bright, clean IPA and puts a different hop variety at the forefront of the sensory experience every year. The inaugural release features Idaho 7, which shows up punching with aromas of orange zest and stone fruit complemented by a hint of black tea leaves in an uncharacteristic element of subtlety. Hop Disciples may look tough on the outside, but with its golden blonde hue and approachable 6.2% ABV, we promise it's a lover not a fighter. The biker theme on hop disciples is based on the original branding from the first days of the Hop Disciples club that used to meet at the brewery and chat about beer and home brews.
Roadie Grapefruit Radler – ABV: 4.0% | AVAILABLE: April-July
Roadie Grapefruit Radler was inspired by the annual Boulderango, where some of Colorado's most tenured brewers join up for a 400+ mile ride. Brewed with natural grapefruit puree, this easy-drinking ale pours a hazy sunrise gold and is bursting with citrus aroma. Unique in its class, this Radler is dry and slightly tart, with just enough bitterness to keep both cyclists and spectators coming back for more. 4% ABV
Strawberry Rhubarb Sour – ABV: 6.2% | AVAILABLE: Jun-Dec
Strawberry Rhubarb Sour will be releasing in 22oz bottles and we can't dote on this brew enough. You're going to absolutely love it. We sure do! If you were at the 21st anniversary party or at GABF this year, you'll remember this beer by it's other moniker, Demeter. GDBC spent a lot of time figuring out how they could possibly brew more of the beer (it's really expensive and labor intensive to make, not to mention concerns about sourcing larger volumes of ingredients, limitations on their production schedule that the process for this brew creates,etc.), but they finally did the research and are making it happen! Don't sleep on this beer! It's amazing!
Chai Yeti Imperial Stout – ABV: 9.5% | AVAILABLE: Oct-Nov
New Chai Yeti will be available in October and November in 22oz bottles. While we haven't tried this iteration of Yeti yet but we can guarantee that it's delicious! If you were at the 22nd anniversary party, they had a chai Yeti firkin and it was a fan favorite, so they are doing a beer in tribute to that firkin! #yetimafia
Barrel-Aged Releases
Barrel Aged Beers (BA Hibernation, BA Old Ruffian and BA Yeti) will moving to 12 oz bottles from 750ml and there will also be an addition of gift packs. Also, this might be the last year you can get any of those beers for a while. These three brews have been GDBC's key packaged BA beers for quite some time, and they are all incredible, but they need some space to work on some other exciting BA and sour projects, so their plan is to let these guys shine in 2017, then head into retirement (or a long vacation) to let some other projects steal the show in 2018.
New Packaging
Colette Farmhouse Ale will now be available in 12 packs, too! Brewed with barley, wheat and rice and fermented at high temperatures with a special blend of four different yeast strains, Colette is fruity and slightly tart, with a dry finish that makes it that rarest of treats — a beer as refreshing as it is complex. Now this ode to the Saisons enjoyed by Belgian farms for centuries will grace your beer fridge or party cooler twelve-at-a-time. Who doesn't love some year-round ‘lettes.
Samurai Rice Ale slices it's way into the party in 15 packs now! Samurai is the perfect beer for your zen garden after battle, or your patio after a long day of work. The addition of rice gives a slightly fruity, crisp, refreshing element to this hazy unfiltered ale, creating a light, easy-going beer suitable for the peaceful warrior. The PD crew were stoked to see this brew come back last year after a couple-of-year hiatus and then GDBC goes right out and ups the ante by bringing this year-round banger back in a bigger package! Samurai cans were also only available in CO when they lunched last year, so now those are available nationwide
New Cans
Nadia Kali – A seasonal favorite, Nadia Kali will now be available in cans from May through August. Nadia's ruby pink glow comes from a generous infusion of hibiscus, while ginger root gives it a subtle spice and hint of woodsy maturity, and lemon peel adds a citrus tartness to keep you on your toes. Full of complexity and intrigue, this unfiltered beauty will show you just how deceiving looks can be…
Claymore Scotch Ale – Claymore Scotch Ale will now be available in cans too! This malty, deep-ruby 7.7% beauty features lots of caramel sweetness, a reserved hop profile, and a subtle warming character. Unlike its namesake, this beer only requires one hand, but it'll still make you feel like nobility all year round.
Hercules Double IPA – Last but definitely not least, Hercules will now be available in cans year-round. Hercules Double IPA is not for the faint of heart. It is, however, fit for the gods. Hercules delivers a huge amount of hops from start to finish. Its hefty backbone of nutty, malty sweetness balances its aggressive hop profile. Time to skull some hops!
Beers Being Put Out to Pasture
Old Ruffian – is a hefty, hop-forward Barley Wine. Seemingly mellow at the start with subtle fruit aromas and complex caramel sweetness, it quickly becomes aggressive with its bold hop flavors and huge hop bitterness. Ultimately, the big body, succulent sweetness and massive hop character come together to work wonders on your palate. It's return is TBD.
Old Ruffian gave up their space in the Tank Farm Series for Hop Disciples.
Whitewater – is an American wheat ale built for exploration. The bold hop profile adds complexity to this crisp, balanced ale, while hints of citrus, light floral notes, and a satisfying bitterness leave a perfect reminder of trails climbed and rapids subdued. Whitewater is the perfect complement to any adventure. It's return is TBD.
Whitewater came out of the seasonal lineup to make room for Roadie Radler.
Oak Aged Yeti – is Yeti Imperial Stout's sophisticated sibling. They may be from the same clan, but they have entirely different personalities. Oak aging gives a subtle vanilla character, rounding out Yeti's intense roastiness and huge hoppy nature. Who says you can't tame a Yeti? It's return is TBD.
Oak Aged Yeti will be retired to introduce a new Chai Yeti.
While we are sad about Old Ruff, White Water and Oak Aged Yeti going on a hiatus, we are thoroughly stoked on the new releases and new packaging options!

In a unique bout of transparency, Epic Games makes publicly available their internal to-do list for Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) development. The company has an entire category of the list dedicated to virtual reality features; support for Samsung Gear VR and Google Project Tango is expected within the next month or two.
“Each card represents a varying amount of work towards implementing a mid-to-high level feature in the engine,” reads the company's public Trello list for UE4 development.
Yesterday, two new tasks—'Samsung Gear VR' and ‘Google Project Tango Support'—were added to the VR category which had remained empty since the company recently finished work on Oculus Rift and Sony Morpheus integrations. The tasks are tagged with ‘September' and ‘October', signaling when the company thinks it will complete support for the new devices, enabling developers to create experiences that utilize them. The tasks were added by Ray Davis, General Manager at Epic Games.
Though Unity was largely the engine of choice for virtual reality game developers out of the gate, Unreal Engine 4, the latest version of Epic Games' game engine, has been swiftly gaining favor thanks to the engine being easier and more powerful than ever, along with an aggressive new pricing scheme that's struck a chord with many developers: $19/month + 5% of gross revenue on game sales. The company also has been quick to update UE4 with support for forthcoming VR hardware.
Gear VR, a VR smartphone adapter developed in partnership with Oculus, was announced at the beginning of September. The device will work with the soon-to-launch Galaxy Note 4 which features an impressive 1440p display. Samsung says Gear VR will be available before the end of 2014, with some rumors pointing to a Fall release date.

The goal of Google's Project Tango is to “give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion.” The project aims to collaborate with hardware and software designers to create an affordable and robust platform for tracking 3D space using sensors and machine-vision. Google has made available a Tango phone device to select developers and plans to release a 7-inch Tango tablet development kit later this year. Interest in Tango from the VR community comes from its potential to provide accurate ‘inside-out' positional tracking as well as environmental recognition and motion input.
A digital currency wallet, Bitsoko funded by Bill & Melinda Gates foundation announced plans to sponsor a series of educational events in Nairobi, Kenya, on the blockchain for start-ups.
The events will focus on the blockchain technology to provide local start-ups with knowledge on opportunities and innovations in the industry. Speakers will be invited from the international and local bitcoin community. Each attendee will receive a small amount of bitcoin and educational literature on bitcoin and the blockchain. The events are scheduled to run on monthly basis for a half a year.
Last month, Bitsoko won a Grand Challenges Explorations research grant worth $100,000 with an opportunity to receive an add-grant of $1,000,000 if the project is successful. The GCE scheme funded by Bill & Melinda Gates foundation helps projects that offer solutions to global health and development challenges. Bitsoko's project is called “Enable Universal Acceptance of Mobile Money Payments” and will be run by Daniel Bloch, a co-founder at Bitsoko. With GCE funding, Bitsoko plans to expand its services to three more African countries: Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Sierra Leone.
Bitsoko is a Nairobi-based Android digital currency wallet that seeks to integrate the blockchain technology to the mobile payment market in Africa. The wallet enables sending money from a smartphone for a 0.1% transaction fee. The start-up sees its mission in bridging fiat in the developed world with digital money in the developing one and to facilitate money transfers to Kenya. The service is currently in beta version.
“The financial structure in Kenya and throughout Africa has changed rapidly since the birth of mobile money by MPesa. We believe that this will only continue to grow and tools such as Bitsoko that leverage Blockchain technology to lower transaction costs will be at the forefront of this boom,” said Allan Juma, another Bitsoko co-founder.
Bitsoko are planning to launch later this year and are currently monitoring the market response in Kenya and Ghana. Surprisingly, nearly 30% of Bitsoko users are from Russia, as Gibson Juma, a co-founder told an online media:
“We think we have been getting users from Russia because of the banning and blocking of some bitcoin related websites in the country.”
The start-up is currently trying to create more services within the wallet to increase the use of bitcoin in Kenya:
“We have signed up local businesses including restaurants, cybercafes, and mama mbogas (roadside vegetable vendors). If you go to a restaurant and pay using bitcoin, the owner of the business will send us the bitcoin and receive mobile money in exchange. We are trying to build the infrastructure around bitcoin, which is lacking here.”
Africa is a quickly growing market in the bitcoin space. CoinFox wrote earlier about BitHub, a new space with strong focus on digital currencies related education and development, in Cape Town. BitX recently announced bitcoin payments for mobile top-ups in Nigeria and South Africa.

On Dec. 14, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan unexpectedly declared national mobilization. Addressing muhktars (elected village and neighborhood headmen), Erdoğan said, “Henceforth, neither terrorists nor their supporters will have a minute of peace.” They encouraged security forces not to hesitate to use their powers, while reiterating that Turkey cannot stay on the defensive but from now on will go on the offensive against terror organizations. The public could not figure out what to do with the idea of national mobilization, which Turkey had not experienced since the 1940s, the World War II era. On Dec.15, Erdoğan elaborated that the national mobilization meant national solidarity. But Turkish mainstream media was already discussing what national mobilization entails. Why would Erdoğan continue increasing the social pressure on the country given the distressing economic and political trends?
For most Turks, mobilization means calling up army reserves and commandeering private buses and trucks for military service.
Looking at the recent events in the country, we can detect a pattern of extreme rhetoric that puts Erdoğan's most recent words into perspective.
After the twin bombings in Istanbul, Erdoğan and their cohorts took it as a personal mission to save Aleppo. Hence, on Dec. 13, the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir organized a rally in Istanbul to protest against Russia. The Russian Consulate in Istanbul is located on the famous Istiklal Avenue, where thousands marched, chanting “Allahu akbar" ("God is great"), “The only path is martyrdom,” “Murderer Russia, get out of Turkey.”
This march provided an interesting insight into the complexities of the country. First, freedom of assembly and protest has become a contested right during the Erdoğan era, and since the declaration of emergency rule July 21, it has become almost impossible to hold a gathering without police intervening. Yet the crowds that gathered in support of Aleppo on Dec. 13 marched peacefully without any interruption. This alone confirms that the Aleppo protest was condoned by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. If you read through Hizb ut-Tahrir's publications and their members' Twitter timelines, you see that they are one of the harshest and most outspoken critics of Erdoğan's failed Syria policies. For example, on Dec. 13, Mahmut Kar, Hizb ut-Tahrir's media bureau chief, tweeted to the Turkish Foreign Ministry: “You will celebrate this [evacuation from Aleppo] as if it was a victory, and your cronies will say ‘Erdoğan intervened so Aleppines were transported.' I say it clearly you sold Aleppo out.”
The Turkish independent press, however, focused on another aspect of what the protesters were demanding — to reinstate the caliphate. The photos clearly show gender-segregated groups and green as well as black flags of the caliphate.
While the protesters were asking the armed forces to march into Aleppo to save the Muslim brothers, AKP parliamentarian Ahmet Conkar viewed this march as a “humanitarian sentiment.” They argued that this protest would have a positive impact on Turkish-Russian relations. None of the AKP members provided comments about the demands of different Islamists groups, and Hizb ut-Tahrir, on the caliphate.
On the same evening, there was another protest in support of Aleppo in the Uskudar district of Istanbul. Aykut Erdogdu, a parliamentarian from the main opposition Republican People's Party, shared a video on Twitter that showed an official Uskudar municipality minibus making the following announcement on loud speakers: “In order to end the bloody, shameful days of Egypt, Syria and Iraq, we must establish Islamic unity as soon as possible and choose our caliph. Unless we obey God's orders to unite, the Islamic world will suffer from occupation, blood, tears and hardship.” The video ended as the unknown preacher defied “Zionists, infidels and imperialists” and crowds continuously replied “Amen.” In this minute-long video, not one person seems to challenge the statement. Yet once Erdogdu shared the video with a comment “This is unconstitutional,” there was a public uproar on social media. The Uskudar municipality was pressured to make a public statement on Dec. 15 that the announcement was not associated with them, because they had rented out the municipality's minibus to a private person, declining any sort of responsibility.
Another incident that disillusioned the Turkish opposition was a series of tweets from research assistant and doctoral student Abdulkadir Sen from Marmara University in Istanbul. Sen tweeted as the Syrian armed forces were declaring victory in Aleppo that anyone who supports the Syrian armed forces or Alevis are awaiting murder in Turkey. Speaking in historical metaphors of centuries of Alevi persecution during Ottoman times, they wrote, “If the Syrian resistance fails, everyone [in Turkey] will have to live with sectarian murderer descendants of Shah Ismail [revered as a spiritual guide by Alevis]. Everyone should prepare for that.” Given the harsh criticism, first Sen changed their Twitter handle, then it was announced that they were put on academic suspension to investigate the allegations. Islamists were up in arms about the decision.
The background of this case also poses quite interesting questions for the AKP. The Turkish public is no stranger to Sen, as they appear on both government-funded and pro-government channels frequently. Also, Sen is the brother of Ibrahim Sen, the first Turkish detainee at Guantanamo Bay. Sen themselves has been taken into custody on suspicion of being a member of al-Qaeda in 2014. But still they managed to land a position at a government university, which requires diligent criminal background checks. How could this be possible without the approval of AKP bureaucracy? This was a frequently asked question on the few social media platforms still open to Turks.
Immediate reactions to these events can be seen on Dec. 15, when the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) headquarters was attacked. Currently 14 out of 59 HDP parliamentarians are in jail, either detained or arrested. In addition, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Regions Party (DBP), which controls 41 municipalities out of 102 municipalities in the southeast, has been taken over by the government. Tens of elected mayors and municipal officers from the BDP are in custody. In short, the HDP —Turkey's third-largest party — is out of the political game, both on the local and national levels.
Except for some social media outbursts, the Turkish public is rather quietly watching all of this unfold, as the state of emergency turns into an ambiguous form of national mobilization. Maybe one picture explains the case better than a thousand words: An elementary school teacher posted on their Facebook page their classroom pictures from the Basaksehir district in Istanbul. One was particularly worrisome, where students held nooses. The students, following the lead of their teacher, were calling for the much-debated capital punishment as final justice for traitors. These photos were indeed a shocking reflection of all the ultranationalistic and hate-mongering rhetoric pumped into the public after the July 15 coup attempt.
On Dec. 15 in a last-ditch effort, Alevi associations, Kurds, secular and other marginalized groups in Turkey initiated a hashtag #OHALdeAleviyiz to show their solidarity with the Alevis against the proposed caliphate. OHAL is an acronym for emergency law in Turkey, and it is a homonym, and the second meaning is “in that case.” Hence, the hashtag reads, “In that case, we are Alevis” and also “During emergency law, we are Alevis.” Hashtags seem to be the only method the fragile opposition has to hold on to hope in Turkey.
There are more examples indicating Turkey's fast movement toward an Islamist system, no longer necessarily led by the AKP, but just tolerated and encouraged. The AKP has championed radicalization, masculinization and Islamization so much so that the unintended consequence is now the populist demand to reinstate the caliphate in Turkey. These Islamist and ultranationalistic groups, which are indeed contradictory on the theoretical spectrum, but work in tandem currently in Turkey, are the only opposition who can write, speak and protest freely in Turkey. What is ahead then for Turkey? With the rhetoric of national mobilization, more visible violence is expected against leftists, foreigners, Alevis, Kurds, gays and women.
Q/A on the Iraq War
Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman interviewed by Anthony DiMaggio
ZNet, November 29, 2005
1. On Reconstruction
Anthony DiMaggio: The “humanitarian reconstruction” of Iraq has been acknowledged to a large degree as a failure in the corporate press. It's interesting, though, to see the reasons given for why: the resistance is hampering reconstruction, there wasn't perfect foresight by the Bush administration in the reconstruction coordination planning process, the excessive “rapid personnel shifts” of those Americans involved in rebuilding, American money has “necessarily” gone to “pacification” instead of rebuilding, etc. What seems to be systematically omitted here is any real responsibility placed on the Bush Administration for its failure to make humanitarian reconstruction a high priority.
Chomsky: The excuses also overlook the fact that the insurgency was created by the brutality of the invasion and occupation — which is, in fact, one of the most astonishing failures in military history. The Nazis had less trouble in occupied Europe, and the Russians held their satellites for decades with far less difficulty. It is difficult to think of an analog. A few months after the invasion, I met a highly experienced senior physician with one of the leading relief organizations, who has served in some of the worst parts of the world. They had just returned briefly from Baghdad, where they were trying to reestablish medical facilities, but was unable to because of the incompetence of the CPA. They told me they had never seen such a combination of “arrogance, ignorance, and incompetence,” referring to the Pentagon civilians in charge. In fact, it was monumental. They even failed to guard the WMD sites that had been under UN supervision, so that they were systematically looted, handing over to someone — probably jihadis –high-precision equipment suitable for producing missiles and nuclear weapons, dangerous bio-toxins, etc., which had been provided to their friend Saddam by the US, UK and others. The ironies are almost indescribable.
Another fact overlooked, though it is finally beginning to leak, is the immense corruption under the CPA, beside which anything attributed to the UN pales in insignificance. Plenty of information has been readily available, but only tidbits were reported here.
One can go on. But the major and crucial point overlooked is the judgment of Nuremberg, declaring that aggression is “the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.” All of the “accumulated evil.” Also overlooked are the stern words of the US Chief Counsel Justice Jackson: “If certain acts of violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us… We must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow. To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well.” Until at least this is recognized, all other discussion is merely footnotes, and shameful ones.
Herman: The U.S. specialty is destruction, not reconstruction, in accord with the U.S. elite's longstanding giving of primacy to military means, and the use of force in dealing with target states. We save them by destroying them, and then move on to the next creative project. This is how it works even when we succeed in bringing into power an amenable client regime, as in Nicaragua after the ouster of the Sandinistas or Afghanistan after the removal and dispersal of the Taliban. There have been explicit leadership statements to the effect that “nation-building” is not our business-we specialize in dismantlement, not construction.
In Iraq, there has been a lot of construction, but not much reconstruction. What have been constructed are massive U.S. military bases and facilities, repairs of oil extraction facilities, and protective walls in and around the Green Zone, which is essentially an occupied fortress within Baghdad. Not much has been done for Iraqi benefit. There are two incentives for reconstruction in Iraq: one is to serve U.S. companies, obviously mainly donor companies like Halliburton and Bechtel, who want the business, especially under conditions where looting is relatively easy given the difficult conditions and fiscal confusion. There is also an incentive to reconstruct in order to help sell the client government to the Iraqi people. The first incentive has been effective, with the donor companies getting lots of business with lots of overpayment, but most of their work has been in base, oil industry, and Green Zone construction, not reconstruction helpful to Iraqis. The second incentive might have had some potency except for the extreme difficulties of working in the highly insecure environment of occupied Iraq, plus the fact that Bush priorities and the unexpectedly high costs of the occupation have made this form of help to the client government too expensive; so helping the client government has been reduced to the U.S. specialty-pacification by violence.
2. On Civil War in Iraq
DiMaggio: A common argument made against de-escalation and withdrawal is that Iraq would fall into civil war. Should this argument be taken seriously by the American public? Many have argued that the U.S. is already promoting civil war in Iraq by training Iraqi security forces to fight other Iraqis (the resistance). In addition, others have pointed out that U.S. occupation is hardly going to change the dynamics of long-standing sectarian and cultural divides between Iraq's various groups (Shia, Kurds, Sunni); in fact it may make them worse by exacerbating relations between Sunni insurgents/resistance and the Shia and Kurds. Is there any legitimacy to the argument that the U.S. should prevent civil war?
Chomsky: Aggressors have no rights, only responsibility. One is to provide massive reparations (not aid). Another is to withdraw forthwith, unless there is very strong evidence that the population wants them to stay. To say that such evidence is lacking is a serious understatement. The most recent poll (August 2005), undertaken by the British Ministry of Defense and leaked to the right-wing British press, reveals that over 80% of the population want the US-UK forces out, that 1% think they increase security, and that 45% approve of attacks on US-UK forces. If this means all Iraqis, as reported, it must be that opposition to the occupiers is far higher in Arab Iraq, where they are actually deployed and engaged. This is not too surprising in the light of earlier information
that has been released.
Herman: The Bush war has already started a civil war as part of the evolving occupation strategy. The character of the occupation, with its murderous use of firepower and harsh treatment of the populace, has steadily enlarged and consolidated a resistance. Having failed to get a puppet effectively installed without even nominal democratic forms, the Bush war managers opted for a tacit alliance with the Shiites and Kurds, who would be given nominal and possibly a modicum of real power via an electoral process, but with much of the legal and power arrangements of the occupation left intact and with the United States staying on to protect the new quasi-rulers from the Sunni-based insurgency. This provoked and institutionalized a civil war, with the occupation maintained as the military arm of one side. Thus the idea that the United States should stay on to avert a civil war is a laugher-it produced the resistance and then moved on to a tacit alliance with the Shiites and Kurds to fight the Sunnis on behalf of the latter two groups while trying to train and arm these to be able to pacify the Sunnis on their own, which is to say in a civil war with the foreign military's direct assistance and participation.
3. On U.S. Withdrawal
DiMaggio: Most Americans seem to be considering withdrawal within the next year or so. Do you think there is any serious role to be played by the U.N. or Arab League in ensuring a power-vacuum does not replace the American occupation, should the U.S. decide to leave? In other words, are these two organizations necessary for promoting security in Iraq? From what polling has revealed, the people of Iraq seem to prefer that Iraqi security forces should take over stabilizing and policing the country, rather than the U.S. or some other power. Is this realistic at all? Would bringing Arab League forces in not just subject Iraq to outside political pressures from neighboring regimes? And does the U.N. really have any credibility there after nearly 15 years of murderous sanctions?
Chomsky: In Western propaganda, the murderous sanctions are called “UN sanctions,” which is technically accurate, but a cowardly evasion. It has always been perfectly obvious that they were initiated and conducted under US initiative, with the “spear carrier for Pax Americana” — as Blair's Britain is described in Britain's leading journal of international affairs — trailing politely behind. And the cruel and savage character of the sanctions (as well as the illegal oil shipments) trace right back to Washington, overwhelmingly. By April 2003, a large majority of Americans felt that the UN, not the US, should take responsibility for Iraq — approximately the position that Spanish voters approved a year later, but in the US, democracy has deteriorated to the point that public opinion has little influence on policy, on a very wide range of issues. The discussion, in any event, is idle. It is for Iraqis to make these decisions. The invaders may have whatever uninformed subjective judgments they like, but they are of only marginal interest, no matter who the invaders are.
Herman: With a U.S. withdrawal there would be a strong incentive for the three sub-national groups to come to some kind of accommodation, without any outside assistance. The U.S. withdrawal would cut out a major part of the rationale for an insurgency, so accommodation would become possible. The very assurance of a specific and near-term U.S. timed exit would probably induce serious indigenous attempts to produce reconciliation and end a struggle that is so costly to all sides, but mostly to the Sunnis and Shiites.
Other Arab states did perform a useful mediation service in Lebanon in earlier years, so their utility in this service is not out of the question. The UN is pretty thoroughly discredited and probably has no useful role to play here. But the possibility of purely indigenous accommodation in the absence of the aggressor-occupier from abroad should not be discounted. The United States has wrecked the country and continues to do further wrecking in its pacification operations, so that ending its operations there would be a gigantic plus. It is not likely that the situation would be as bad or worse with the United States and its “coalition of the bribed” out of Iraq, and there is an excellent chance that it would be much better. The Iraqis surely ought to be given that chance of freedom from an aggression-occupation following their long years of non-freedom under Saddam Hussein.
The United States should not only get out quickly, it ought to be compelled or shamed into paying huge sums to a free Iraq to compensate for the enormous damage that resulted from its commission of the “supreme crime” and murderous occupation.
Virginia's Department of Motor Vehicles is so accustomed to drivers trying to sneak lewd, gross, hateful or racist messages onto personalized license plates that it has a rigorous process to root them out.
A manager in the Personalized Plates Work Center reads through every application, putting any suspicious combination of letters and numbers into a computer program that analyzes the potential plate for hidden meaning. Questionable messages go to a 20-person Word Committee for review and a vote. Among the few printable examples of rejected license plates, according to Melanie Stokes, a member of the Word Committee, are "JERKA55," "IPOOPD," and "HORNI1."
But sometimes, the system doesn't quite work.
The owner of a Ford truck bearing the license plate 14CV88 will have to find a new message after the DMV on Wednesday canceled its earlier approval of that series of letters and numbers.
A photo of the truck hit the Web a few days ago, went viral on car and other blogs and finally came to the attention of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group for American Muslims. On Wednesday morning, the group complained to the DMV that the plate contained a white supremacist and neo-Nazi statement.
A few hours later, the DMV agreed that the plate contains a coded message: The number 88 stands for the eighth letter of the alphabet, H, doubled to signify "Heil Hitler," said CAIR's Ibrahim Hooper. "CV" stands for "Confederate veteran" -- the plate was a special model embossed with a Confederate flag, which Virginia makes available for a $10 fee to card-carrying members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. And 14 is code for imprisoned white supremacist David Lane's 14-word motto: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
The giveaway that something was amiss, Hooper said, was the truck itself. An enormous photo of the burning World Trade Center towers covers the entire tailgate, with the words: "Everything I ever needed to know about Islam I learned on 9/11."
Hooper at first thought the picture was a Photoshopped hoax. But when they called the DMV and discovered the plate was registered in 2005 to a Ford F-150 pickup truck, Hooper started to worry.
"If the license plate had been on a VW Beetle with nothing else on it, or a Volvo station wagon, no one would probably have noticed," said Hooper. "But when the Confederate flag is thrown in . . . it shows the convergence of anti-government and anti-Islamic sentiments that unfortunately seem to be growing."
The DMV would not release the identity or location of the vehicle owner, citing privacy laws. Virginia has the highest percentage of personalized plates in the nation.
"Even with our rigorous process, we miss a few," Stokes said. "And we missed this one."
No word on whether the truck, shown in the photo in a parking spot reserved for the handicapped, has the requisite disability tags.
We know what the Daily Mail thinks of Marxists. It held the same opinion in the 1920s. So, when Bethnal Green Borough Council decided in 1927 to name its new housing scheme the Lenin Estate, it was – almost literally – like a red rag to a bull (or red bull to a rag, if you want to be clever).
In reality, it's a complex and, in some ways, rather sad story.
Labour first took control of Bethnal Green Borough Council in 1919, returning 24 councillors to the Liberals' six. The Party's ‘uncrowned king', according to the local press, was Joe Vaughan who would be Bethnal Green's mayor for the three succeeding years. As a member of the British Socialist Party and, from 1920, its successor organisation the British Communist Party, they were proclaimed by The Call ‘the only openly-avowed Bolshevik Mayor' in the country.
But at a time of fluid politics on the left and when there was very widespread sympathy for the Soviet Union in Labour ranks, they were far from being the only Communist in the Bethnal Green labour movement.
The national Labour Party consistently rejected Communist Party affiliation but individual Communists could join the party and would, in any case, be frequently selected as delegates of affiliated trade unions. This ‘Broad Left' was particularly strong in Bethnal Green. In a generally bad year for Labour, it held on to power in the Council in 1922 by the skin of its teeth.
By the time of the next local elections in 1925, it was, however, an increasingly fragile coalition. Nationally, Labour had barred individual Communists from membership. Locally, if local press accounts are to be believed, rival groups of ‘Communists' and ‘Moderates' had published competing manifestos.
Still, some kind of joint slate was engineered for the November municipal elections and local ‘Labour' actually slightly increased its narrow majority. Of its 17 councillors, it was said 12 were Labour and 5 Communist. One of the latter, Joe Vaughan, was a leading figure in the National Left-Wing Movement founded in December to oppose Communist expulsions. The national Labour Party expelled the Bethnal Green constituency party the following year for its continuing Communist links.
To disinterested observers, all these left-wing squabbles will seem far removed from the more pressing issue of the people's housing. But constructive politics did continue.
The commemorative tablet marking the beginning of the Lenin Estate – the Parmiter Street scheme as it was then known – was unveiled in September 1926, the Communist chairperson of the Housing Committee, Councillor William Paddock, absent through illness.
The name of the Estate was agreed by 14 votes to 10 at a heated Council meeting in July 1927. To Joe Vaughan: (1)
It would record the appreciation of members of the Council and their recognition of the great work they had done on behalf of the workers of the world…the children would be asking ‘Who is Lenin?' and their parents, if they were honest, would be compelled to tell them what Lenin did for the downtrodden peasants of Russia.
To the Labour mayor, Alderman CW Hovell, on the other hand, it was:
an insult to the memory of men in the Labour movement who had passed to ignore them in favour of Lenin. They might have been all right in Russia but they were not, in their opinion, right for England.
A voice from the gallery called on Hovell to ‘Give up that chain!' This was presumably a reference to their mayoral regalia rather than those chains which Marxists held to bind the workers of the world but, if not, it was a good pun.
A loan of £28,704 from the LCC financed the scheme – 32 two-bed and three-bed tenements in a handsome four-storey yellow-brick block designed by architect ECP Monson. Even the politically hostile Bethnal Green News concluded the block was ‘magnificently constructed' – though it gave credit for this to ‘Mr William Sims, the enterprising Stepney builder, who secured the contract'. (2)
But the high quality of the accommodation did not meet universal approval. The Evening News claimed that the estate was nicknamed ‘Buckingham Palace' and suggested, solicitously, that ‘some of the tenants find it difficult to furnish the large rooms…The living room on the average requires 20 square yards of linoleum'.(3)
The new residents included a carman and their wife with nine children, the eldest of whom was just 14, and a hawker and their wife with six children. The newspaper went on to describe the Estate's tenants as ‘typical Bethnal Greenites' – ‘undersized people with oversized families'.
They were grateful for their new homes, however, whatever the paper thought:
It is all so beautiful we don't know where we are. You should see the place we left.
Sound-proofed floors and roofs, inbuilt ‘artistic dresser-cabinets' and a ‘water heating system specially designed for rapid service' must indeed have been a massive improvement on their previous accommodation.
The Daily Mail, under the lurid headline ‘Lenin Flats De Luxe. East End Very Angry', pointed out that the flats had cost £800 each to build compared to the £500 cost of comparable LCC homes. It was shocked too by the ‘free light' the tenants received. (4) In fact, there was a flat rate charge of between 1s 3d and 1s 5d (6p and 7p) for electricity included in rents of 18s 3d (91p) weekly for a two-bedroom flat and 21s 3d (£1.06) for a three-bed.
The name and quality of the flats were not the only points of controversy. It was unfortunate, perhaps, that one of their first tenants was Councillor Paddock. The appearance of favouritism was not dispelled by the circumstances of their selection.
The Council stated officially that 1235 applications had been received for the 32 flats.(5) At the meeting of the Housing Committee to select the first tenants, it was alleged, of 19 applicants, that 15 were people occupying one room and of those only two had fewer than three children. Only one applicant had three rooms and just two children. (6) That would be Councillor Paddock.
Paddock's disingenuous statement to the press that their ‘name was on the waiting list and when my turn came I appeared before the housing committee, of which I am chairperson, in the ordinary way' seems, to put it kindly, to contain its own contradiction.
But there's more. The Daily Mail also claimed that Councillor Paddock had stated no Jews would be granted tenancies in the new estate – at a time when they formed about 12 per cent of the local population and were among its poorest. Others on the Council denied any policy of the sort but the attention given to the claim suggests it had some plausibility.
And then, conversely, there was the charge – backed by a sworn statement – that five Jewish residents of the borough had been persuaded to pay sums of money ranging from £5 to £3 10s ‘to a person or persons not unconnected with the Borough Council' for the promise of a tenancy. (7)
Not surprisingly, not unreasonably, the press had a field day. The Council promised an independent inquiry into all the allegations to be conducted, it hoped, by the Ministry of Health and Housing. But the Ministry declined to become involved.
The Council regretted the decision and the delay which, it said, ‘must inevitably militate against the success of any inquiry that might now be undertaken'. Moreover, it lamented the fact that it lacked the necessary statutory authority to conduct its own independent inquiry.
The conclusion? ‘We are unable to suggest a course of action which will give effect to the very strong desire of the Council to take further action in this matter'.(8) One can almost hear the collective sigh of relief and, with this, the matter was kicked into some very long grass. I can tell you no more, I'm afraid, about the rights and wrongs of the matter and the individuals, if any, involved.
Except that some form of rough justice did pursue Councillor Paddock. In September 1927 they were expelled from the Labour-Communist group on the Council and then from the Communist Party itself – ‘for acting contrary to the interests of the working class'.
At the same time, Paddock tried to resign from the Council but couldn't afford the 5s (30p) fee required. One month later, the matter was taken out of their hands. They informed the Council they were in receipt of poor relief – this disqualified them automatically from Council membership.
The sense of a life unravelling becomes definitive in December when Paddock was sentenced to five months' imprisonment for stealing funds from the Christmas Club of which they were secretary, trustee ‘and everything else'. (9)
And then there's politics. The Communist Party's Minority Movement – intended initially to radicalise unions from within – began to shift to a more sectarian stance. And in the summer of 1928, the international Communist movement moved towards a radical ‘Class against Class' policy which denounced the Labour Party as ‘social fascists'. In Bethnal Green, local tensions no doubt added to the animus – on both sides.
In the borough council elections of November 1928, Communists attacked Labour followers as ‘scabs of the worst kind' and promised to ‘fight them tooth and nail'. Bethnal Green Labour, for its part, stood ‘loyally by the policy of the national Labour Party' and ‘refused to accept the dictates of the Minority Movement which is governed by foreign political organisations which', it added, in case there were any doubt, ‘means Russia'. (10)
In the event, Liberals took all 30 seats. Labour congratulated itself on ‘putting the Communists at the bottom…the Communist Party will be wiped out and we will be in the position of a real proper Labour Party'. (11) Five years later, the Labour Party did, in fact, achieve its own clean sweep of the Council. The Communist presence in the borough remained strong and militant but it would never again exercise power.
As for the Lenin Estate, amongst the first actions of the incoming Liberal administration was to rename it the Cambridge Heath Estate. It remains a fine building but it's been sold off and now it's called Cambridge Court. A ‘delightful two-bedroom apartment offering high ceilings, stripped floor boards, bespoke storage and off street parking' can be yours ‘in this highly sought after and fashionable location' for £369,000 according to estate agents.
Just sometimes – only sometimes – all that political noise and effort seems like so much ‘sound and fury, signifying nothing'.

Vera Florence Cooper Rubin (; July 23, 1928 – December 25, 2016) was an American astronomer who pioneered work on galaxy rotation rates.[1] They uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves. This phenomenon became known as the galaxy rotation problem, and was evidence of the existence of dark matter.[2] Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades. Them legacy was described by The New York Times as "ushering in a Copernican-scale change" in cosmological theory.[1][3]
Beginning their academic career as the sole undergraduate in astronomy at Vassar College, Rubin went on to graduate studies at Cornell University and Georgetown University, where they observed deviations from Hubble flow in galaxies and provided evidence for the existence of galactic superclusters.[1][3]
Rubin spent their life advocating for women in science and was known for their mentorship of aspiring women astronomers. Them data provided some of the first evidence for dark matter, which had been theorized by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. They were honored throughout their career for their achievements, and received the Bruce Medal, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the National Medal of Science, among others.[3][4]
Early life [ edit ]
Vera Rubin was born Vera Florence Cooper, on July 23, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They were the younger of two sisters. Them parents were Jewish immigrants: Philip Cooper, a Polish-American electrical engineer who worked at Bell Telephone and Rose Applebaum Cooper, of Bessarabian origin, who worked at Bell until their marriage.[1][5] Them father was born in Vilnius, Lithuania (until 1945 Vilnius was Polish), as Pesach Kobchefski.[5]
The Coopers moved to Washington, D.C. in 1938,[1] where 10-year-old Vera developed an interest in astronomy watching the stars from their window.[1][6] They built a crude telescope out of cardboard with their father, and began to observe and track meteors.[7][8][9] They attended Coolidge Senior High School, graduating in 1944.[8]
Rubin's older sister, Ruth Cooper Burge, eventually became an administrative law judge in the United States Department of Defense.[5]
Education [ edit ]
Rubin was inspired to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there.[1] They also ignored advice they had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist.[1][7] They graduated from Phi Beta Kappa[10] and earned their bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948,[7] the only graduate in astronomy that year.[4][11] They attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to their gender.[1][3][11] Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years.[4] Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to their husband, Robert Rubin's, position as a graduate student at Cornell University.[7]
They enrolled at Cornell University, and earned a master's degree in 1951.[6][8] During their graduate studies, they studied the motions of 109 galaxies and made one of the first observations of deviations from Hubble flow (how the galaxies move apart from one another).[3][7][12] They worked with astronomer Martha Carpenter on galactic dynamics, and studied under Philip Morrison, Hans Bethe, and Richard Feynman.[9][13] Though the conclusion they came to – that there was an orbital motion of galaxies around a particular pole – was disproven, the idea that galaxies were moving held true and sparked further research.[7] Them research also provided early evidence of the supergalactic plane. This information and the data they discovered was immensely controversial, and after fighting to be allowed to present their work at the American Astronomical Society despite being pregnant, they were summarily rejected and the paper forgotten.[9]
Rubin studied for their Ph.D. at Georgetown University, the only university in Washington, DC that offered a graduate degree in astronomy.[3][14] They were 23 years old and pregnant when they began their doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home.[4] They began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended them to George Gamow, their eventual doctoral advisor.[15] Them dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades.[3][7][14][16] Throughout their graduate studies, they experienced discouraging sexism, including an incident where they were not allowed to meet with their advisor in their office, because women were not allowed in that area of the university.[1][7]
Career [ edit ]
Rubin held various academic appointments for the next eleven years. They served for a year as an Instructor of Mathematics and Physics at Montgomery County Community College, then worked from 1955 to 1965 at Georgetown University, as a research associate astronomer, lecturer (1959–1962), and finally, assistant professor of astronomy (1962–1965).[1][16] They joined the Carnegie Institute in 1965, as a staff member in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism,[1][16][17] where they met their long-time collaborator, instrument-maker Kent Ford.[7] Because they had young children, they did much of their work from home.[8]
In 1963, Rubin began a year-long collaboration with Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, during which they made their first observations of the rotation of galaxies at the McDonald Observatory's 82-inch telescope.[7] During their work at the Carnegie Institute, Rubin applied to observe at the Palomar Observatory in 1965, despite the fact that the building did not have facilities for women.[18] They created their own women's restroom, sidestepping the lack of facilities available for them and becoming the first female astronomer to observe there.[1][3][19]
At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin began work related to their controversial thesis regarding galaxy clusters[16] with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph.[20] This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see.[7][20] The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in the expansion of the Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth.[9][21] First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid.[3][9] The effect is now known as large scale streaming.[19] The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.[7][9]
Wishing to avoid controversial areas of astronomy, including quasars and galactic motion, Rubin began to study the rotation and outer reaches of galaxies, an interest sparked by their collaboration with the Burbidges.[7] They investigated the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, again beginning with Andromeda, by looking at their outermost material, and observed flat rotation curves: the outermost components of the galaxy were moving as quickly as those close to the center.[22] This was an early indication that spiral galaxies were surrounded by dark matter haloes.[3][7] They further uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies based on the visible light and the observed motion.[23] Them research showed that spiral galaxies rotate quickly enough that they should fly apart, if the gravity of their constituent stars was all that was holding them together; because they stay intact, a large amount of unseen mass must be holding them together, a conundrum that became known as the galaxy rotation problem.[3][22]
Rubin's calculations showed that galaxies must contain at least five to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter.[24][25] Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades,[1] and became the first persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s.[1][9][26] This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing.[7][9] Them research also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.[3]
Another area of interest for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Them discovery that some gas and stars moved in the opposite direction to the rotation of the rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.[19]
Rubin's perspective on the history of the work on galaxy movements was presented in a review, "One Hundred Years of Rotating Galaxies," for the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 2000. This was an adaptation of the lecture they gave in 1996 upon receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, the second woman to be so honored, 168 years after Caroline Herschel received the Medal in 1828.[3][27] They continued their research and mentorship until their death in 2016.[7]
Legacy [ edit ]
When Rubin was elected to the National Academy of Science, they became the second woman astronomer in its ranks, after their colleague Margaret Burbidge.[7] Rubin never won the Nobel Prize, though physicists such as Lisa Randall and Emily Levesque have argued that this was an oversight.[9][28] They were described by Sandra Faber and Neta Bahcall as one of the astronomers who paved the way for other women in the field, as a "guiding light" for those who wished to have families and careers in astronomy. Rebecca Oppenheimer also recalled Rubin's mentorship as important to their early career.[1][24][13][22][29]
Rubin died on the night of December 25, 2016 of complications associated with dementia.[1][8][30] The president of the Carnegie Institution, where they performed the bulk of their work and research, called them a "national treasure."[4][24]
The Carnegie Institute has created a postdoctoral research fund in Rubin's honor,[24][31] and the American Astronomical Society has named its Division of Dynamical Astronomy early career award after Rubin.[32][33]
Rubin was featured in an animated segment of the 13th and final episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.[34] An area on Mars, Vera Rubin Ridge, is named after them and Asteroid 5726 Rubin was named in their honor.[35][36]
Awards and honors [ edit ]
Personal life [ edit ]
From 1948 until their death in 2008, they were married to Robert Rubin.[19][52] Vera Rubin became a mother during their graduate studies at Cornell, and continued to work on their research while raising their young children.[1] All four of their children earned Ph.D.s in the natural sciences or mathematics: David (born 1950), a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey; Judith Young (1952–2014), an astronomer at the University of Massachusetts; Karl (born 1956), a mathematician at the University of California at Irvine; and Allan (born 1960), a geologist at Princeton University.[6][7][29] Them children recalled later in life that their mother made a life of science appear desirable and fun, which motivated them to become scientists themselves.[7]
Motivated by their own battle to gain credibility as a woman in a field dominated by male astronomers, Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. They faced discouraging comments on their choice of study throughout their life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues.[7][4] In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy.[4][13][53] They and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. They said that despite their struggles with the NAS, they continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it "the saddest part of [her] life".[7][9][19] Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, they stated: "In my own life, my science and my religion are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us understand our role in the universe."[54]

November 30, 2009 — Alderson Warm-Fork
Most readers will probably have by now that Switzerland has passed a referendum to ban the building of minarets anywhere in the country. This has prompted many musings, in particular on the relationship between democracy and liberty.
This looks, after all, like an example of an illiberal but democratic measure. This prompts Chris to say
“We have, therefore, a simple conflict of fundamental values, a vindication of Isaiah Berlin: …Some among the great goods cannot live together. That is a conceptual truth. We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.”
By contrast, Left Outside tries to harmonise the two (and hence judge this decision undemocratic) by saying
“I don't think it must be inherently democratic simply because it was a decision returned by a referendum. There are some things in a democracy more fundamental than simply voting for representatives or in referenda…equality before the law is essential, as is…freedom of conscience”
Dave argues for a similar sort of conclusion along different lines:
“If democracy is merely about the relationship of individuals to authority then [this ban is democratic], but if democracy is about associative relationships and how we collectively relate to authority, then the Swiss have weakened that associative relationship and its collective relationship with the Swiss state…
[D]emocracy is weakened, because democracy can only really proceed from a correct understanding of, for want of a better phrase, how things work.”
All of these are valid points, but I'm not sure they would convince Chrisiah Berlin (a composite personality insisting that ‘some among the great goods cannot live together'). Isn't this just a redefining of the word ‘democracy' to include various more substantive notions of freedom?
If we define ‘schmemocracy' as ‘the will of the majority being effected', regardless of whether that will is well-informed, or cohesive, or correct, then have we just replaced an apparent conflict between liberty and democracy with one between ‘democracy' and ‘schmemocracy'?
To my mind, though, there's a more basic argument for thinking that this event doesn't show us a conflict between liberty and democracy/schmemocracy. Namely, that even if we define ‘democracy' as ‘the will of the majority being effected', this definition is still technically ill-formed.
Because what is meant by ‘the majority'? After all, the number of people who voted ‘yes' in this referendum is a few million, which is less than 0.1% of human beings. That's not a majority.
So there must be some criterion of what counts as the relevant population, the ‘demos' of whom a majority is needed. One way to define that is to assume that the relevant population is always that of the sovereign nation-state. That is what, it appears, the great majority of people nowadays do, but it looks distinctly arbitrary to me. National boundaries are largely about how successful one groups of armed men have been relative to other groups of armed men. Nationalism then is rather like deciding political issue by a boxing match between leading politicians.
To my mind, the only reasonable way to define the relevant population is by a measure something like ‘those who are affected'. Now, those who sincerely and passionately want to build minarets are substantially affected by this ban; those who just don't like seeing them, or knowing they're there, are affected in a much more superficial way. One is being prevented from doing something by the state, while the other retains complete freedom either way, and merely has to tolerate seeing some disliked structures as they walk past.
So in this sense, the people who might or might not build minarets are the primary ‘demos' (in that freedom of religion is primary over the sort of diffuse right to a ‘nice-looking' neighbourhood) and I imagine a majority of them voted ‘no'.
Indeed we could go further. If three people want to build a minaret, and aren't hurting anyone else by doing so, they form the primary ‘people affected' and so the ‘democratic' thing is for them to choose whether they can build a minaret or not.
And a big part of anarchist models of society (and, I presume but don't know for sure, of Marxist non-models after the ‘withering away' of the state) is the idea of voluntary federation: that individuals and groups of any size should have the constant right to withdraw from larger social organisations if they feel heavily persecuted. This is not a magic bullet, but it is, I think, the most basic way to organically embody this idea of individual and minority freedom within the structure of democracy.
This isn't always as simple as I may have made it sound, of course. Things affect lots of people to different degrees – such as by consuming resources that others could have used. But we've always known that – we've always known, in particular, that Mill's famous ‘harm principle' is only a rule of thumb against the complexities of the real world. But it's still a good rule of thumb, and what's interesting is that by paying attention to who counts as the relevant ‘majority', we can make the harm principle (that paradigmatic claim of personal liberty) coincide and connect neatly with valuing democracy.
Also, of course, there can still be tragic conflicts – between one person's liberty and another's, between one groups' democracy and another's. But that's not the same as a conflict between liberty and democracy in the abstract.
Which makes a certain sense: both are principles of self-rule, one individual and one collective.
As part of a general upheaval within the French government and military due in part to demoralizing losses at Verdun and the Somme, the formidable General Joseph-Jacques-CÉsaire Joffre is dismissed as commander in chief of the French forces in favor of General Robert Nivelle.
French authorities blamed Joffre, the stalwart champion of France s Plan XVII military strategy since 1911, for recent defeats on the Western Front as well as for the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, where some 500,000 Allied troops based out of the Greek port city of Salonika were mired in what they feared might be a losing struggle with Bulgarian forces. For their part, Nivelle believed an aggressive offensive was the key to a breakthrough on the Western Front. The French government felt pressure to take some action to counter the Germans declaration of unrestricted U-boat warfare; they were also swayed by the support Nivelle enjoyed from their counterparts in Britain, including the new prime minister, David Lloyd George.

In early April 1917, then, French and British troops embarked on what would become known as the Nivelle Offensive, hoping to quickly and decisively punch a hole through the German lines in France. All did not go as planned, however, as the strength and depth of the German positions, built up since the fall of 1914, proved too much for the Allies. By the end of the first day, almost all the French tanks, introduced into battle for the first time, had been destroyed or had become bogged down, and within a week the hospitals in the area were treating 96,000 wounded. The battle was called off on April 20.

The contrast between Nivelle s lofty objectives and the reality of the offensive s disappointing outcome caused great disillusionment and anger among the French troops. A series of mutinies began in late April 1917 and increased in the two succeeding months, eventually involving about 40,000 troops. Nivelle had cut soldiers leave time in March, only releasing 5 percent of the French army at a time. In July, Nivelle was replaced by Phillipe PÉtain, who increased the leave time given to each soldier to 13 percent, or ten days leave every four months, in an effort to curb discontent and offer the French troops some much-needed time to rest and recuperate.
NEW DELHI: Facebook has announced that it is cleaning up its News Feed to weed out spammy posts, so that users of the social networking website don't miss important and relevant stories and to penalize spammers.Elaborating on the move, Facebook posted on its blog that it's introducing a series of improvements to News Feed to reduce stories that users frequently flag as spam. “Many of these stories are published by Pages that deliberately try and game News Feed to get more distribution than they normally would,” said Facebook employyes Erich Owens and Chris Turitzin.Facebook will essentially take steps to counter three kinds of news feed spam – Like-baiting, frequently circulated content and spammy links.Facebook says “Like-baiting” is when posts explicitly ask readers to like, comment or share the post, to get additional distribution beyond what the post would normally receive. “ The improvement we are making today better detects these stories and helps ensure that they are not shown more prominently in News Feed than more relevant stories from friends and other Page,” said the Facebook executives.The update will not impact Pages that are genuinely trying to encourage discussion among their fans, Facebook clarified.Facebook is also improving News Feed so that it doesn't focus on pages that reshare content as most users do not find such content relevant.Stories that misguide users into clicking on links to pages that contain only ads or a combination of frequently circulated content and ads, will also be restricted. For instance some stories may claim to link to a photo album but instead take the viewer to a website with just ads, the social networking giant iterated.“By measuring how frequently people on Facebook who visit a link choose to like the original post or share that post with their friends, we've been able to better detect spammy links,” it added. According to Facebook, the update improves News Feed to reduce cases of spammy links, and in early testing it has witnessed a 5% increase in people on Facebook clicking on links that take them off of Facebook.
Naked they lay, clasped in my longing arms,
I filled with love, and they all over charms;
Both equally inspired with eager fire,
Melting through kindness, flaming in desire.
With arms, legs, lips close clinging to embrace, [5]
They clip me to their breast, and sucks me to them face.
Them nimble tongue, Love's lesser lightening, played
Within my mouth, and to my thoughts conveyed
Swift orders that I should prepare to throw
The all-dissolving thunderbolt below. [10]
My fluttering soul, sprung with the painted kiss,
Hangs hovering o'er their balmy brinks of bliss.
But whilst their busy hand would guide that part
Which should convey my soul up to their heart,
In liquid raptures I dissolve all o'er, [15]
Melt into sperm, and spend at every pore.
A touch from any part of them had done't:
Them hand, their foot, them very look's a cunt. Smiling, they chide in a kind murmuring noise,
And from their body wipes the clammy joys, [20]
When, with a thousand kisses wandering o'er
My panting bosom, "Is there then no more?"
They cry. "All this to love and rapture's due;
Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too?" But I, the most forlorn, lost man alive, [25]
To show my wished obedience vainly strive:
I sigh, alas! and kiss, but cannot swive.
Eager desires confound my first intent,
Succeeding shame does more success prevent,
And rage at last confirms me impotent. [30]
Ev'n their fair hand, which might bid heat return
To frozen age, and make cold hermits burn,
Applied to my dead cinder, warms no more
Than fire to ashes could past flames restore.
Trembling, confused, despairing, limber, dry, [35]
A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I lie.
This dart of love, whose piercing point, oft tried,
With virgin blood ten thousand maids have dyed;
Which nature still directed with such art
That it through every cunt reached every heart — [40]
Stiffly resolved, 'twould carelessly invade
Woman or man, nor aught its fury stayed:
Where'er it pierced, a cunt it found or made —
Now languid lies in this unhappy hour,
Shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower. [45] Thou treacherous, base deserter of my flame,
False to my passion, fatal to my fame,
Through what mistaken magic dost thou prove
So true to lewdness, so untrue to love?
What oyster-cinder-beggar-common whore [50]
Didst thou e'er fail in all thy life before?
When vice, disease, and scandal lead the way,
With what officious haste dost thou obey!
Like a rude, roaring hector in the streets
Who scuffles, cuffs, and justles all they meet, [55]
But if their king or country claim their aid,
The rakehell villain shrinks and hides their head;
Ev'n so thy brutal valour is displayed,
Breaks every stew, does each small whore invade,
But when great Love the onset does command, [60]
Base recreant to thy prince, thou dar'st not stand.
Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most,
Through all the town a common fucking-post,
On whom each whore relieves their tingling cunt
As hogs do rub themselves on gates and grunt, [65]
May'st thou to ravenous chancres be a prey,
Or in consuming weepings waste away;
May strangury and stone thy days attend;
May'st thou ne'er piss, who did refuse to spend
When all my joys did on false thee depend. [70] And may ten thousand abler pricks agree
To do the wronged Corinna right for thee.
Patrick Foot is a writer on financial markets at IG, a leading provider of online trading. In this article they examine what the current lack of volatility in the forex markets means for traders of digital currencies like bitcoin.
The last 12 months have been barren for forex investors hoping for some currency movements they can base trading strategies on.
Volatility has dwindled from healthy levels in mid-2013 down to 25-year lows in May and July this year.
Several reasons have been put forward for what may be the cause of this dry spell, but the overriding causes appear to be the continually low interest rates set by central banks, increased geopolitical risk and return to growth from major economies (keeping risk low in other assets).
Bitcoin's nature sets it apart from such outside factors as these. A lack of a central regulator (or base in a national bank) keeps bitcoin separate from interest rate movements and economic recovery. The escalation of tension between any of Russia, America, Israel or the Middle East is unlikely to play out in bitcoin markets.
That has resulted in bitcoin enjoying a starkly different 12 months to more traditional currencies, experiencing a swing worth of over $1,000 before levelling out at somewhere around the $550-$650 mark for the past few months – a comparative drop in volatility, but still unstable when compared to other currencies and markets.
As such, the major movements tend to be associated with major developments in the currency itself. Bitcoin's growth at the end of 2013 was largely down to a Senate committee ruling on its legitimacy, and dwindling in February around the disastrous fall of Mt Gox.
However, there are several ways in which the lull in forex volatility and boom in bitcoin can be related. Its position outside political and economic influence certainly makes bitcoin attractive to those driven away by low interest rates in the US, UK, EU and other major economies. In that respect, bitcoin could be seen as a high-volatility commodity: useful to traders in times of low market movement elsewhere.
Until some of the oft-noted fears surrounding bitcoin's legitimacy and stability are answered, price fluctuations will be hard to predict to all but the most insightful of traders. The longer the current situation continues, however, the better for bitcoin.
Traders are being forced to diversify their portfolios and risk appetites are growing as economies recover without liquid forex markets to accompany them. At the moment, the bullish sentiment in several major indices is taking the majority of investor attention and bearish news on bitcoin continues to dissuade those looking for a forex alternative.
But the outlook for both of those assets could reverse entirely at any moment.

Can coral survive a bleaching event? If the stress-caused bleaching is not severe, coral have been known to recover. If the algae loss is prolonged and the stress continues, coral eventually dies. Download this infographic: In English | In Spanish
Warmer water temperatures can result in coral bleaching. When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. This is called coral bleaching. When a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality.
In 2005, the U.S. lost half of its coral reefs in the Caribbean in one year due to a massive bleaching event. The warm waters centered around the northern Antilles near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico expanded southward. Comparison of satellite data from the previous 20 years confirmed that thermal stress from the 2005 event was greater than the previous 20 years combined.
Not all bleaching events are due to warm water.
It's a perfectly crisp Monday morning at Mr. Jefferson's University. Not quite cold but the early fall air packs enough of a chill that a sweater is a necessity for the first time in months, and hot coffee makes for a perfect early morning walk along the silently serene Lawn.
It's there, steps from the Rotunda, that I meet a man named Michael Bunting. He's a fourth-year at the University from a small town in Northern Virginia called Aldie, double majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. He's the president of both a campus ministry organization called Cru and of the Engineering Student Council. Over the past 60 hours (at time of publish), most of the college football world has gotten to know them by the name "Sad Virginia Fan." But over the course of our interview, conducted over the greatest breakfast sandwiches this side of the Blue Ridge, I find that the meme he's known for isn't necessarily representative of who they are. He's just a loyal fan who was caught in a moment of visceral reaction.
For a refresher, he's the fan seated in the front row of Section 105 who was captured by ABC cameras slumped over the ledge after Notre Dame's game-winning touchdown with 12 seconds to go.
On our way to Bodo's, I ask Bunting, who wanted to talk to STL before any other news outlet, how long he's been a Virginia fan. I almost stop in my tracks when they tell me they come from a Virginia Tech family. They switched loyalties their first day on Grounds (Aug. 28, 2012, they point out) and started going to football games immediately - starting with two wins over Richmond and Penn State in Mike London's third year as Virginia head coach.
A somewhat abridged version of our interview is below. Questions and answers have been edited for grammar and style.
Streaking The Lawn: Fortunes in football have kind of gone in a different direction than some other ones around here have gone. Have you been to most of the football games over your four years now?
Mike Bunting: Probably not every single one, but a large majority. I've even been to a few away games, like my first year I went to the away Duke game and sat in the Duke section and wore an orange shirt.
STL: Did you rush the field after Louisville and Miami last year?
MB: I did. I also made it on the Jumbotron for the Miami game. I was the runner-up, if you will, for the iPad dance contest so that was my first debut onto the big screen.
STL: Have you met Goose Guy or any of these other viral stars of UVa sports?
MB: I've only known of Goose Guy from the ESPN clip. Funny story is that they are, I believe, an electrical engineer fourth-year at the time. Which is funny, because I'm in basically the same department and also a fourth-year. So it's like there's a common thread between us. But I haven't actually met any of them in person.
STL: What were your thoughts going into the season?
MB: I believe in our program with Mike London. They actually spoke at one of our Cru gatherings when I was a first-year. They spoke on the power of believing in a team and faith in a cause, and so that's when I knew they had the emotional drive, they had the character development to instill within their team. So whether or not at the end of the day we end up producing results and a winning season, for me it's not as important because I know how good of a coach they are as a person. Yes, if we end up having a 1-11 season and that's all we do, even though it's my fourth year, I know that would be fine with me because I'm going to go to every single game and cheer my heart out. At the same time, I still believe that we can go to a bowl.
STL: On to the subject of the game itself. UVa's just scored to take the lead over the No. 9 team in the country. What are you seeing and hearing around you?
MB: Not gonna lie, I'm not a huge waterworks guy. There are few times in a man's life where it's appropriate to cry, but this was one of them. I never shed a tear, but my eyes did get watery - that's a distinction that needs to be made. But that's basically my reaction, yelling at the top of my lungs, hands straight up, high-fiving, Good Old Song at the top of my lungs.
STL: What was in the air on that Notre Dame play where it was fourth-and-short, and Virginia was one play away from the win?
MB: There's sound equipment and chairs in front of us, we're not supposed to rush the field, but they're clearing the path below where we're standing because they're anticipating students jumping over the ledge. All these thoughts were going through our heads. I actually have a broken foot,** so I had to figure out how I was going to jump onto the field. I broke my foot the day before classes started playing basketball. I have to be in my boot for another three weeks or so, but I was "architect-ing" jumping onto the field with this broken foot.
** - Ed. Note: Yes, Mike was actually ready to jump a good seven feet onto the field on one good foot, planning on landing on the one that wasn't broken.
STL: Describe how you saw the winning catch.
MB: They were running to my left and the hill was on my right. When that drive was occurring, I started having this "Oh my God, we're going to win, they're going to have this valiant effort to come back and it's going to be in vain." It's like in those movies when everyone is celebrating but one person realizes that something bad could happen so you focus on that person. My friend since first-year Dagoberto, who was standing to my left, has their hands matter-of-factly on the ledge and we picked up how Notre Dame was making an epic push, and the "Who wants to win it more?" question was coming up in my mind.
When the catch is made, I realized that that is literally the last play they had. I went back to YouTube later to see how many seconds had transpired between when the catch was made and when they showed me, and I believe I was hanging on the edge the entire time [between the catch and when] they were showing me on TV.
That was a momentary thing. One of the things I wanted to make sure I highlighted in this interview is that the meme that's been generated isn't necessarily true. Sad Virginia Fan is a bit of a misnomer because not only am I a normally happy guy in general, but I'm not disheartened about our football team in that way. I didn't choose the meme life; the meme life chose me. If people want to call me Sad Virginia Fan then so be it.
STL: Who was the girl who patted you on the back?
MB: Them name is Maggie, she's a fourth-year and also part of Cru. Probably the entire time I remember being slouched over they were patting me on the back. That the camera caught me right before they started patting me on the back is great.
STL: How long did it take your phone to start blowing up and people recognizing you as this guy?
MB: I had just got my haircut on Friday, uncharacteristically short. Because I have interviews coming up, I cut it sort of short. So everyone who saw the back of my head didn't recognize me. The only person that recognized me was my mother. Them and my dad were watching the game at home and they ended up talking to me later and was like "I'd recognize the back of that head anywhere."
Lately I've been busy preparing for the world beyond Scott Stadium so I haven't been following it closely, but I saw things start to blow up on social media about 10 minutes after that. When I got back to my house, people from across the street rushed over and were like "Mike, Mike, you're on the Internet and you might be famous."
STL: Do you know that you're the subject of a parody Twitter account?
MB: Oh yeah, somebody did show me that. I think it's hilarious. The Simba one is my favorite.
Get up! Wake up! pic.twitter.com/CiHx4wvZDf — Sad Virginia Fan (@SadVirginiaFan) September 13, 2015
STL: Are people around Grounds recognizing you at all?
MB: I have not been yet identified by a single person.
STL: Are you thinking about a win over Tech this point?
MB: It has to be because that's the last game. I think we'll be 5-6 going into it like we were last year but everything will be in the right place this time. Because Virginia Tech doesn't have the luck of the Irish.
STL: What do you want people to know about Mike Bunting beyond the picture?
MB: My hopes are still high. That was a momentary, in-the-place feeling. It's been used to say "This is UVa football in one single picture." I don't want people to think that about me. People can relate to the visceral reaction but I think if you ask around, more people would maybe tell you that they're hopeful. For me, every single game I will go and cheer as if we are the winning team every single time.
CLOSE Son of actor Jean-Claude Van Damme makes an initial court appearance on suspicion of holding roommate at knifepoint in Tempe. Maricopa County Superior Court

The son of actor Jean-Claude Van Damme was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of holding their roommate at knife point in their Tempe apartment, according to Maricopa County Superior Court records.
The situation began after the man, identified as Nicholas Van Varenberg, 21, was involved in a disturbance on an elevator in their apartment building, near Veterans Way and College Avenue, records said. The incident happened at University House, an apartment complex just off the Tempe campus, at 323 E. Veterans Way.
According to the documents, they were seen on a surveillance video camera punching the wall of an elevator.
Tempe police were called and officers followed a trail of blood leading back to Van Varenberg's apartment, according to records.
Police checked on Van Varenberg and their roommate, but Van Varenberg only appeared to have an injured hand and did not need medical attention, records said.
When police left the apartment, Van Varenberg confronted their roommate about answering the door for police. They claimed they do not like police and told their roommate they should not answer the door for them in the future, statements included in the records show.
Van Varenberg continued to yell at their roommate, according to the records, and their roommate later told police they had been acting strange, licking the blood from their injured hand, according to the court documents.
Police later received a complaint of loud banging and yelling in the apartment, records show. When the police went back to check on the men in the apartment there were no answers.
Officers attempted to convince them it was only the police trying to check in. Van Varenberg pulled a large knife from the kitchen and angled it toward their roommate standing approximately 4 feet away, court records allege.
Van Varenberg demanded their roommate keep quiet and get into their room, according to the records. Their roommate told police they felt that if they didn't comply, their "parents will be at my funeral in two days," records show.
The roommate eventually convinced Van Varenberg that they would not talk to the police, and Van Varenberg let them out of their room. Their roommate later ran out into a hall in the building and made a phone call, security footage showed, according to the court records.

Van Varenberg eventually came out of the apartment on their own as police were attempting to secure a search warrant, records said.
Police searched the apartment and found drug paraphernalia related to marijuana use, according to the court documents.
Van Varenberg was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault, unlawful imprisonment, and drug possession about 12:10 a.m. on Sunday. Their bond was set for $10,000.
 They are a junior at Arizona State University, majoring in interdisciplinary studies.
The court documents indicate that Van Varenberg told authorities their father is the actor and that they had the financial means to post bond and to leave the state or country.
Actor Jean-Claude Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg, according to their biography listed on several web sites, which also list Nicholas as one of their three children.
Nicholas Van Varenberg will have a hearing on Sept. 30.

Lisa Bloom, who helped to expose alleged harassment at Fox News, urges Ofcom to kill the deal: ‘This is a company that made choices against women's rights'
The lawyer who has helped to expose the alleged sexual harassment at Fox News, ending the career of the star anchor Bill O'Reilly, has warned that the battle over workplace discrimination is far from over. “I hate to break it to you. Unfortunately, I don't think we are going to age out of this problem,” said Lisa Bloom.
Calls for Ofcom to block Sky takeover until Fox News cases are resolved 21st century fox Read more
Bloom, who has been defending women in the workplace for 30 years and represents three women now suing Fox for sexual harassment, says many things have changed over their career. “People are far less accepting today of this kind of behaviour. If we get to a jury, we are going to do very well. Most companies, when you call them out on bad behaviour, are going to want to negotiate with us and give my client a good settlement and rectify the situation. Attitudes have changed, but there is still a great deal of work that needs to be done,” they told the Guardian.
But there is still plenty of appalling behaviour out there. Silicon Valley has shown that sexism is alive and well for a younger generation of “brogrammers” at Uber and other companies. And Bloom, founder of the Los Angeles-based Bloom Firm, is not expecting their company to run out of cases as ageing baby boomers retire from the workforce.
But Bloom holds a special animus for Fox News and Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. The media company is not a “fit and proper” company to take over Sky, the UK's satellite TV giant, according to the lawyer.
Bloom was in London last week to address the UK media regulator Ofcom as it considers 21st Century Fox's bid to take full control of Sky. Bloom was accompanied by Dr Wendy Walsh, one of three women Bloom currently represents who have accused O'Reilly of sexual harassment – and the company of attempting to cover up the scandal.
Bloom agreed to keep details of the discussions with the regulator confidential, but said they and their client “were listened to respectfully, and they are taking the matter seriously”.
“The UK has been a world leader on women's rights. I think when the UK has a choice to make between women's equality and corporate greed, they are going to stand with women's equality and say this company is not fit and proper to expand its interests in the UK,” Bloom told the Guardian.
“The parent company may be called 21st Century Fox, but they behave more like 19th Century Fox,” said Bloom. “This is a company that over and over again, when no one was watching them, made choices against women's rights. They made choices to stand with the perpetrators of sexual harassment,” said Bloom.
Bloom's view echoed that of the lawyer Doug Wigdor, who also met Ofcom last week. Wigdor, acting for 21 current and former Fox News employees, said 21st Century Fox's takeover of Sky should be blocked until allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News had been resolved. They also called for 21st Century Fox to lift gagging orders on victims of harassment and discrimination at Fox News who reached settlements with the company over the last decade.
Fox's previous attempt to take full control of Sky was derailed by the investigation into the hacking scandal at News Corporation, the newspaper arm of Murdoch's empire. As in 2011, Ofcom is assessing the acquisition on competition grounds and on whether the combined company would be “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license.
Many financial analysts expect Ofcom will clear the deal.
Bloom said: “They are clearly not fit and proper, if those words have meaning ... Nobody has given me an argument that they are fit and proper, by the way. What I have gotten in response is that that they are a very big company and the Murdochs are billionaires. Well, that has nothing to do with it.
“This is a company that has flouted the law when it comes to women's rights in the workplace, and I think there should be consequences for that. It's important to teach this company a lesson that other companies will then see.”
Bloom's visit to Ofcom in the UK comes as the US investigations into allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox are expanding. Federal investigators have begun looking at how the millions of dollars Fox paid out in settlements were reported to shareholders. They are believed to be looking at payments relating to complaints against O'Reilly and the former Fox chairperson Roger Ailes, who was forced out amid another series of alleged sexual misconduct claims last July.
Bloom has also asked New York state's division of human rights to investigate allegations of harassment and retaliation at the company, headquartered in Manhattan.
Both O'Reilly and Ailes have strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Bloom said the ultimate responsibility lay with 21st Century Fox.
“When they thought they could get away with it, they kept him, and they paid women off to silence them. The same is true for Roger Ailes. It's only because Gretchen Carlson [a former Fox anchor who alleged Ailes harassed her], a very brave woman, publicly shamed them that they were brought down. Didn't our grandmothers teach us that the measure of character is how we behave when no one is looking?”
In a statement, 21st Century Fox said: “21st Century Fox's actions demonstrate its clear commitment to providing a positive, safe and inclusive workplace free of harassment and discrimination. The company's management has taken prompt and decisive action to address reports of sexual harassment and workplace issues at Fox News. These actions have led to an overhaul of Fox News channel's leadership, management and reporting structure, and have driven fundamental changes to the channel's on-air talent and primetime programming lineup.
“In assessing and transforming the leadership team at Fox News, the company has been focused on its long-held commitment to a diverse workplace that promotes racial and gender equality, elevating Suzanne Scott to the post of president of programming; along with the hiring of a new female CFO, Amy Listerman, to lead the financial operations at the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network. This newly instituted leadership structure at Fox News brings it closer in line with the wider practices at 21CF, where women serve as the Chair and CEOs of its Fox film studio as well as its Fox television studio and the Fox television network.”
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers on Thursday that they have some doubts that what are known as alternate scoring models will give enough credit to the potential for economic growth when assessing the impact of the Trump administration's tax plan.

In late April, the administration put out a one-page overview of its tax reform plans, which would cut taxes for businesses to 15 percent, as well as cutting taxes and simplifying income tax brackets for individuals. Critics questioned how the tax cuts would be offset without driving up the federal deficit.
“What I have said repeatedly is that any plan we put forward we believe should be paid for with economic growth,” Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee. “I am concerned as to whether some of the models will attribute enough growth in dynamic scoring but when we present the details we will present how we think it should be paid for.”
Mnuchin has said the April plan was deliberately vague in order to allow the White House to more effectively work with lawmakers to come up with a joint agreement that could pass Congress.
How to pay for the tax cuts remains a sticking point. Fiscal conservatives in the Republican-controlled Congress would strongly prefer a revenue-neutral plan as they are against increasing deficits.
Mnuchin has said the cuts would pay for themselves under a dynamic scoring model analysis, which takes into account the effect of tax changes on economic growth and revenue.
At Thursday's hearing, Mnuchin was also peppered by Democrats on the committee about details of the tax plan, including whether or not cuts would mostly benefit the wealthy.
“I can assure you the president's objective and my objective is we create a middle income tax cut and we do not raise taxes on the middle income, if anything the opposite,” Mnuchin said.
They added that the plan would get rid of almost every single tax deduction, which they said were disproportionately used by the wealthy and that the aim was that 95 percent of Americans would no longer need to itemize deductions.
Later on Thursday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, the Treasury secretary insisted that tax reforms remain on track despite growing doubts among investors on the size and scope of any cuts achievable in Congress.
A renewed push on a repeal of Obamacare is currently being worked on in the Senate while reports that President Donald Trump may have tried to interfere with a federal investigation has shifted focus away from the congressional agenda.
“I am still very hopeful that we'll get tax reform done this year,” Mnuchin said.
MONTREAL -- Quebecers might feel like their vision is fuzzy these days when they read that their province has been lumped in with North Korea, Syria and Sudan on a list of ineligible sites for a National Geographic photo contest.
The fine print for the magazine's "Explore our Changing World" contest has caused something of an online stir this week in La Belle Province.
It's not the first time a contest has avoided the province because of its strict rules. So now Quebec has found itself on a contest blacklist that includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, as well as a pair of U.S. states, New Jersey and Vermont.
The provincial government isn't thrilled.
"It's a bit troubling," said Joyce Tremblay, a spokesperson for the provincial commission that oversees contests, the Regie des alcools, des courses et des jeux.
It's not a new phenomenon. Some contest-makers have avoided Quebec over the years because of strict rules governing how those competitions are run in the province. The rules have been in place since 1978 and are designed to protect consumers and ensure prizes are paid out.
Some of those rules include deposits for certain contests depending on where they're being held; registering advertisements before contests begin; and allowing the government to mediate any lawsuits that may stem from contests.
Given those rules and the potential costs associated, some sponsors aren't willing to deal with Quebec, despite the fact it remains the country's second-most-populous province.
But Tremblay said the decision to leave Quebecers out of the contest was misguided.
They said that since National Geographic is running a photography contest -- and not a commercial contest, with cash prizes -- the media organization didn't face the same rules and would not have had to pay any fees.
"This contest wasn't subject to our rules," Tremblay said.
"Sadly, they decided to exclude Quebec without checking the facts because they were afraid they'd have to pay."
Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada to have such rules.
But plenty of other contests work within the province's rules without any trouble.
Tremblay said some 8,866 contests were authorized and held in Quebec last year alone, with large operations like McDonald's and Tim Hortons holding their popular contests like Monopoly and Roll-up-the-rim in the province, just like elsewhere in Canada.
Since getting lumped in with places like North Korea and Syria isn't great for the province's reputation, Tremblay said they hope companies take the time to call and get the right information.
"They don't even take two minutes to call and sometimes the amounts (to pay) are quite minimal," Tremblay said.
The prestigious magazine's contest runs for three weeks this month and asks photographers to document change.
The prizes include getting a photo published in the magazine as well as a trip to New Mexico to take part in a photography seminar.
"It's a little bit sad," Tremblay said.
"But it's National Geographic that decided to put us (Quebec) there because they wouldn't have had to pay anything."
National Geographic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“I try to capture innocence and rage. Anyone who has been a teenager knows it ain't fun. It's not a very nice situation,” Jouko Lehtola, the late photographer who captured teens burgeoning on early adulthood as they kissed, danced and discovered the world around them, once said. For over two decades, the Finnish creative documented their surroundings in Helsinki, honing their fascination amongst the city's ever-changing face of youth. Far from just a voyeur, Lehtola was deep amongst it – the raves, parties, heartbreak, tears, hangovers, hickeys, pimples and tattoos, all found themselves immortalised by their lens. Now, their work is being honoured in a 50-page tome titled Finnish Youth. Published by AALTO, the book is a thick documentation of red mohawks, patched leather jackets, greasy hair and Coca Cola-imbued moments from the 90s and early 00s – one that opens a window onto the fleeting moments of Finnish youth.
Finnish Youth is available now from AALTO

The European Union is pushing back against the House-approved measure to strengthen sanctions against Russia, arguing “America first cannot mean that Europe's interests come last.”
“The U.S. bill could have unintended unilateral effects that impact the EU's energy security interests,” Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said in a statement. “This is why the Commission concluded today that if our concerns are not taken into account sufficiently, we stand ready to act appropriately within a matter of days.”
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the measure 419-3 on Tuesday, paving the way for the Senate to approve a similar proposal, which it is expected to do, setting up a showdown with the White House. The measure is especially controversial because not only does it tighten sanctions against Russia for its election interference and invasion of Crimea, but it mandates that the president consult with it before waiving the punitive measures; at present the president can waive sanctions determined to be detrimental to U.S. interests.
President Trump has not said whether he'll sign the measure, but they see friendly relations with Russia as an important cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy. The approval of the House measure comes amid scrutiny of the Trump campaign's ties to Russian officials in the run up to the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election in order to boost Trump, though it's unclear if Moscow's efforts succeeded. Trump's equivocation over the issue has led to more speculation about their campaign's ties to Russian officials—links that are being investigated by the Justice Department and congressional committees.

Extending the ICD-10 transition another 12 months has been significant — estimated in the millions. It's really hard to think of 2014 as anything but the year that Congress delayedICD-10 implementation. In March, they approved the “Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014.” It was a quick bill that:
• Prevented a steep decrease in Medicare payments scheduled for March 31.
• Delayed scheduled Medicaid cuts to hospitals serving low-income patients.
• Changed the ICD-10 implementation date to Oct. 1, 2015.
No one has publicly admitted to slipping in the following paragraph: “SEC. 212. DELAY IN TRANSITION FROM ICD–9 TO ICD–10 19 CODE SETS
The Secretary of Health and Human Services may not, prior to October 1, 2015, adopt ICD–10 code sets as the standard for code sets under section 1173(c) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d–2(c)) and section 162.1002 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations.”
Strangely enough, the American Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for the defeat of the that delayed ICD-10 implementation one year. PAMA delayed a 24 percent Medicare cut to physicians for the 17th time. The AMA wanted the sustainable growth rate formula that calls for cuts to be repealed completely. Otherwise, someone is going to have to lobby for another delay in the spring. And the AMA argued that the delay would prevent progress meant to strengthen the Medicare program without mentioning the ICD-10 delay. Extending the ICD-10 transition another 12 months has been significant — estimated in the millions. And it makes us wonder if ICD-10 coding will ever see the light of day in the United States. Hands down. It's the most significant development in the ICD-10 transition.
#ICD10Matters
I'm not suggesting that a Twitter hashtag comes close. But the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) social media campaign is part of an effort that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) couldn't do alone.
Mostly because they lost a lot a credibility in the Healthcare.gov rollout. Insisting that Oct. 1, 2014, is the last and final ICD-10 deadline right before Congress pushed it back a year didn't help either.
So the healthcare information technology industry started some significant ICD-10 advocacy work. And that was almost as important as the ICD-10 delay itself.
Now AHIMA is part of a strong effort — more than writing letters — to educate representatives and senators why ICD-10 matters. It's positioning the code set above the flaming water ski jokes and bureaucratic burden.
Is it enough to push ICD-10 implementation to Oct. 1, 2015? That's what I'm writing next week.

After 50 years in the industry and more than 100 films to their credit, Jackie Chan hardly requires an introduction. Loved by all, respected by all, Jackie Chan is universally hailed as a legend. Jackie has many fascinating aspects of their life, which we, in spite of being their fans, are unaware of.
So, here are 10 little-known and fascinating facts about Jackie Chan:
10. Their Parents Left Him as A Child
Jackie's father, Charles was a spy working for the Chinese National government and while at their duty they had arrested a stage performer and opium seller named Lee-Lee, whom they later married. Charles and Lee-Lee both had two children on either side from their previous marriages whom them left and fled to Hong Kong when the communists came to power in 1949. Jackie was born five years later and immediate endeavours were made to sell for a price of $26 to the doctor who helped deliver him. Later Jackie was left in a boarding school while the parents went to Australia in search of work.
Life in boarding school was hard as Jackie and their fellows students were given lessons on drama, acrobatics, martial art and music and were beaten up at any mistake. The school didn't teach reading or writing to its students. At the age of 8 Jackie appeared in a movie for the first time and following Bruce Lee's death, they slowly established themselves as Hong Kong movie industry's next big star.
9. Angry Jackie's Real Fight on Set
While filming for ‘Wheels on Meals' in 1984, Jackie became angry on being painfully hurt by Benny ‘The Jet' Urquidez (a kickboxing world champion) while shooting a fight scene with him. Jackie, by-the-way had landed a few blows on the boxer as well. Furious and frustrated Jackie challenge Urquidez for a real exhibition match and since Jackie was not much of a kickboxer himself, Urquidez warned them saying he'd get hurt. Soon the crew members began taking sides and placing bets but unfortunately for them, the exhibition match never happened. Letting by-gones be by-gones, Jackie and Urquidez appeared again in a fight scene of the film ‘Dragons Forever' (1988).
8. When They Almost Died Performing A Stunt
Jackie Chan is an ace stunt performer and has pulled off seemingly impossible life threatening stunts with relative ease. But once in 1986 they were nearly killed performing a simple stunt. They flew down to Yugoslavia and went to the set (with a jetlag) to jump from a wall to a tree. Though their first try was successful but it did not appeal to their sense of perfection and on the second try, Jackie fell short from the branches of the tree and unable to grab them, plummeted down on the rocks below. Following this they suffered skull fracture and a bone poking into their brain tissue that caused bleeding out of their ears. The incident has left its mark as they partially lost hearing in their right ear and a plastic plate still corks a hole in their head.
7. They Don't Understand Hollywood
Jackie isn't much of a fan of Hollywood. Even after years of success with blockbuster movies like Rush Hour films and Shanghai Noon films, Jackie says that they don't get American humour nor do they understand Hollywood's craziness behind car-chase formulated film. Jackie reported didn't like Rush Hour and would not have done the sequels had they not offered them truck load of money. Around the 1980s during their initial years in Hollywood, Jackie had struggled to establish their own style because their early directors had wanted them to be the next Bruce Lee. None-the-less Jackie Chan has become a revered superstar who might not have worked with Hollywood's big daddies like Steven Spielberg but it doesn't matter because, “in Asia, everybody comes to see Jackie Chan in a Jackie Chan film.”
6. A Perfectionist Who Was Awarded
Movies are big deal. We are aware of the gravity of expectations from, especially, renowned directors. Rumour has it that Charlie Chaplin while directing their famous film ‘City Lights' redid a scene 300 times just to get the rose held at a perfect angle. David Fincher is said to retake a scene for an average of 50 times. But our beloved Jackie Chan has beaten them all when while directing the film ‘Dragon Lord' (1982), they had had 2,900 takes for a single 10 minutes scene. It was the elaborate opening scene of the film with a dozen of stuntmen involved. They were awarded by the Guinness World Record for the highest number of takes for a scene.
5. A Stunt That Froze Their Blood
Even after years of practise and years of successful stunt performances Jackie finds every stunt terrifying. But nothing was quiet as terrifying as the one they managed to pull off in ‘Who Am I?' If you have seen the film you'd very well remember the climax where they slide down the 21 storied Willemswerf Building in Rotterdam. It wasn't a straight sliding (how could Jackie be satisfied with a straight stunt). They travelled down the slant side of the building at 45-degree angles, tumbled over, stood up walked down speedily before falling forward and sliding forward. Reportedly it took them two weeks to work up the courage to do this stunt.
4. They Sing and Has 20 Albums to Their Credit
That's our wantonly talented Jackie. We already know that they were strictly brought up in a boarding school where no academic lessons were given. Their rigorous childhood training made a master singer out of them and since 1984, they have churned out 20 albums featuring their song. From 1980, they have been singing the closing credits of all their Chinese movies and had sung the theme songs of their film ‘Young Master'. The Disney film ‘Mulan' released in China had Jackie singing ‘I'll Make a Man Out of You' for the dubbed versions.
3. Their Body Is Full Of Injuries
Almost every part of their body has suffered pain. Jackie has injured their hand countless time, broken their nose three times, has injured their knee innumerable time so much so that now they use a body double for shooting sprinting scenes. They have broken their ankle, injured their neck, crushed their thigh between two vehicles and has also dislocated their pelvis, shoulders and sternum. Jackie is known, not just to perform their own stunts but performing even in injury.
2. Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association
Early in their career Jackie would often get hurt while performing stunts with stuntmen. Since then they have built a stuntmen association named ‘Sing Kar Pan' with trusted and well trained men, some of them being their boarding school buddies. The team would together with Jackie choreograph the action scenes and while filming they would even live together. Till now ‘Sing Kar Pan or Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association' has worked in 28 of Jackie's films.
1. Their Guinness World Records
They hold two more world records – one for performing the most stunts by any living stuntmen & two, for taking care of as many as 15 different works in their latest film ‘Zodiac'. They were the director, writer, lead actor, executive producer, producer, unit producer, art director, cinematographer, manager, prop man, stunt coordinator, stuntman, gaffer, theme song vocalist, composer and even the food caterer. Yup, that's our Jackie!
New homes are going up in a South Surrey neighbourhood and new families are moving in.
Part of the appeal to families is nearby Sunnyside Elementary. The problem is the school is not just full, it's overflowing.
“It's crazy, I don't even know where our daughter is going to end up going,” parent Sarah Northcott said. “I don't know if we're going to put them in here or if they could be accepted in here.”
Surrey is the province's fastest-growing school district with an additional 1,000 students expected to squeeze in next fall.
The district already spends $4 million a year installing and maintaining almost 300 portables and there are more to come.
Surrey School Trustee Laurae McNally says they think the district is “at crisis level.”

That's why the school board is calling on the city to stop development in three areas: Grandview/South Surrey, Clayton and South Newton.
They want a moratorium on new homes until the province builds more schools.
“I'm not anti-development, but when I talk to people, they say they want a complete community, not just houses,” McNally said. “After all, schools are the heart of our communities.”
However, Surrey Mayor Linda Hepner said “putting a halt on development is not the solution.”
The province is building a new high school in Surrey and three more elementary schools, but not in time to help families at Sunnyside Elementary. The three-year-old school is getting four more portables in the fall.
It has some families looking elsewhere.
“Unfortunately, I think we're looking at moving out…to the valley because it's just overcrowded,” Northcott said.

This tasted really good as I recall. Very satisfying. The 'mystery' aspect failed though... I distinctly remember you could tell the flavor based on whether the seam on the piece was in the center, off-center, or near the edge. Oddly enough, I remember that yet I don't remember there being non-filling pieces.

From: General MillsIntroduced in 1993"The taste that's full of surprises!"The front of the cereal box described Hidden Treasures as a "crunchy and sweetened corn cereal - some with artificially flavored fruit centers" and asked the question, "which ones hold a hidden treat?"A 1994 television commercial described it like this:"Thing aren't always what they seem. Take Hidden Treasures cereal... every square looks the same... sweet, crunchy, right? But certain ones have a taste of fierce, fruity frosting inside. Some got it. Some don't. Some blast ya. Some won't. Hidden Treasures... the cereal that's more than it seems."The mascot for Hidden Treasures was a robot named H.T. who appeared to have an inverted metal cereal bowl for a hat. On the introductory box, the side panel included the following text under the headline "HT's Out Of Their Mind For Inventions!""H.T.'s researching fun inventions in hopes he'll be inspired to invent a way to discover which Hidden Treasure pieces have the fruity filling. Can you help them match the fun invention to the description of how it was invented." Then there were four short paragraphs describing the inventions of the bowling ball, Silly Putty, the Slinky and roller skates.The back of the first box described the cereal in a series of comic panels:"New Hidden Treasures Cereal is amazing. Some pieces have fruit inside... some don't! That's the fun of Hidden Treasures... not knowing when you'll discover a yummy blast of cherry, orange and grape flavor. New Hidden Treasures... the taste that's full of surprises!"The first 7 items in the very long list of ingredients were corn meal, corn flour, sugar, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, corn syrup, salt and grape juice.

Cheddar cheese and ice cream go together like the rainy Pacific Northwest and summer sweets: surprisingly well. You can taste the combo in a single spoonful, thanks to the "Beecher's Flagship" ice cream flavor created by Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream in Seattle. The unlikely dessert is the brainchild of Molly Moon's owner Molly Neitzel, who collaborated with the city's Beecher's cheese shop because it shared their artisanal, local-first philosophy—and because Neitzel simply liked watching cheesemakers manhandle huge slabs of curd at Beecher's Pike Place Market headquarters.
The iced treat is milder than the semi-hard Flagship cheese usually served on crackers; Beecher's uses raw cow's milk and ages it 15 months for a strong flavor signature. The off-white ice cream, on the other hand—which is supersmooth thanks to 19 percent butterfat—is almost vanilla until a nutty tang finally hits the palate. Pick up a pint for $5.50.

Joaquim Hernández – the father of Xavi Hernández – spoke of the tense moments that the Spanish international players had to go through, due to the battles between Real Madrid and Barcelona two years ago, coming soon after Spain's World Cup triumph and coinciding with José Mourinho's first season at Real.
“This issue caused Iker a lot of problems with Mourinho. These problems came into the public eye and are well known, due to the fact that Xavi and Iker didn't want to abandon their friendship”, said the father of the Barcelona and Spanish international midfielder.
“If it hadn't been for Iker Casillas, Xavi and (Vicente) Del Bosque, the national team wouldn't have come so far. There were some very difficult moments as a result of the Clásicos (Real Madrid vs. Barcelona games).
Players who had been teammates and friends almost lost that friendship. There were no arguments. We saw what happened with Arbeloa, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos and how they acted with their teammates in the national squad. Some players' behaviour was not appropriate. It was a good thing Iker and Xavi stepped in”, they added.
[ANN] SciSmalltalk v0.16
we are too happy to announce SciSmalltalk v0.16
SciSmalltalk is a Smalltalk project, similar to existing scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy for Python or SciRuby for Ruby. SciSmalltalk already provide the following basic functionalities:
complex and quaternions extensions,
random number generators,
fuzzy algorithms,
Didier Besset's numerical methods,
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solver.
Version 0.16 includes updates from Werner Kassens to several packages, the work Nicolas Cellier about arbitrary precision floats.
SciSmalltalk project web page is here. All the code is available under the MIT licence. We have more than 563 green unit tests and we run a CI job here
This version should work on Pharo 3.0/4.0 and also Squeak 4.5 (to be confirmed).
We are looking for more code contributions and also tests, documentation ! Join the mailing-list.
However, executing animations manually in code is tedious, particularly in a presentation, where you want to be able to step forward and backward. So I added a Director class whose job it is to coordinate things. All you do is feed it a script of steps (add this object, animate that object). Then, as it applies them, it remembers the previous state of each object and generates an automatic rollback script. It also contains logic to detect rapid navigation, and will hurry up animations appropriately. This avoids that agonizing situation of watching someone skip through their slide deck, playing the same cheesy PowerPoint transitions over and over again.
Presenting Naturally
With MathBox's core working, it was time to build my slides for the conference. After a quick survey, I quickly settled on deck.js as an HTML5 slidedeck solution that was clean and flexible enough for my purposes. However, while MathBox can be spawned inside any DOM element, it wouldn't work to insert a dozen live WebGL canvases into the presentation. The entire thing would grind to a halt or at least become very choppy.
So instead, I integrated each MathBox graphic as an IFRAME, and added some logic that only loads each IFRAME one slide before it's needed, and unloads it one slide after it's gone off screen. To sync up with the main presentation, all deck.js navigation events were forwarded into each active IFRAME using window.postMessage. With the MathBox Director running inside, this was very easy to do, and meant that I could skip around freely during the talk, without any worries of desynchronization between MathBox and the associated HTML5 overlays.
In fact, I applied a similar principle to this post. To avoid rendering all diagrams simultaneously and spinning up laptop fans more than necessary, each MathBox IFRAME is started as it scrolls into view and stopped once it's gone.
I've also found that having a handheld clicker makes a huge difference while speaking—as it allows you to gesture freely and move around. So, I grabbed the infrared remote code from VLC and built a simple bridge from to Cocoa to Node.js to WebSocket to allow the remote to work in a browser. It's a shame Apple's decided to discontinue IR ports on their laptops. I guess I'll have to come up with a BlueTooth-based solution when I upgrade my hardware.
Towards MathBox 1.0
In its current state, MathBox is still a bit rough. The selection of primitives and viewports is limited, and only includes the ones I needed for my presentation. That said, it is obvious you can already do quite a lot with it, and I couldn't have been happier to hear that all this effort had the desired response at the conference. I wasn't 100% sure whether other people would have the same a-ha moments that I've had, but I'm convinced more than ever that seeing math in motion is essential for honing our intuition about it. MathBox not only makes animated diagrams much easier to make and share, but it also opens the door to making them interactive in the future.
I plan to continue to evolve MathBox as needed by using it on this site and addressing gaps that come up, though I've already identified a couple of sore points:
I used tQuery as a boilerplate and because I liked the idea of having a chainable API for this. However, this also means it's currently running off an outdated version of Three.js. I need to look into updating and/or dropping tQuery.
MathBox has been updated to Three.js r53.
MathBox has been updated to Three.js r53. Numeric or text labels are completely unsupported. It should be possible to use my CSS3D renderer for Three.js to layer on beautifully typeset MathJax formulas, positioning them correctly in 3D on top of the WebGL render.
I've added labeling for axes. I've integrated MathJax, but it's tricky because the typesetting is painfully slow in the middle of a 60fps render. But it's automatically used if MathJax is present.
I've added labeling for axes. I've integrated MathJax, but it's tricky because the typesetting is painfully slow in the middle of a 60fps render. But it's automatically used if MathJax is present. All styles have to be specified on a per-object basis. Some form of stylesheet, default styles or class mechanism to allow re-use seems like an obvious next step.
There are undoubtedly memory leaks, as I was focused first and foremost on getting it to work.
Expressions that don't change frame-to-frame are still continuously re-evaluated, which is wasteful. There is a live: false flag you can set on objects, but it triggers a few bugs here and there.
flag you can set on objects, but it triggers a few bugs here and there. There needs to be a predictable, built-in way of running a clock per slide to sync custom expressions off of. In my presentation I used a hack of clocks that start once first invoked, but this lacks repeatability.
I added a director.clock() method that gives you a clock per slide.
Finally, it doesn't take much imagination to imagine a MathBox Editor that would allow you to build diagrams visually rather than having to use code like I did. However, that's a can of worms I'm not going to open by myself, especially because the API is already quite straightforward to use, and the library itself is still a bit in flux. Perhaps this could be done as an extension of the Three.js editor.
You can see what MathBox is really capable of in the conference video. I invite you to play around with MathBox and see what you can make it do. Contributions are welcome, and the architecture is modular enough to allow its functionality to grow for quite some time.
CLOSE FSU teacher resigns after posting profane Facebook comments
Deborah O'Connor (Photo: Courtesy FSU)
Florida State University does not have a policy governing what faculty and staff can – or cannot – say on social media.
But FSU College of Business senior lecturer Deborah O'Connor agreed that they went too far with their reactions on Facebook last Thursday to a photo of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. O'Connor submitted their resignation the following day, one week before the end of finals for the fall semester.
FSU officials have declined to comment on O'Connor's sudden resignation, other than to confirm that there are no rules governing use of social media.
O'Connor took issue with a Facebook post by Colin Lively, a New York City-based consultant to the beauty industry, which welcomed Holder's decision to have the U.S. Justice Department investigate the police shooting death of a black 12-year-old boy carrying a toy gun. The fatal shooting of the boy came amid high-profile deaths of unarmed black men by white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y.
O'Connor called Lively a gay slur and used profane language.
"Take your Northern (gay slur) elitism and shove it up your (expletive)," O'Connor wrote on Lively's Facebook post (they are not Facebook friends, but have one mutual friend on the social media site).
"I teach at a University, you (expletive). What do you do?" they added. "You are an intellectual fraud, just like your Messiah. Obama has single-handedly turned our once great society into a Ghetto Culture, rivaling that of Europe."
O'Connor told the Tallahassee Democrat that they were embarrassed by the entire incident. They were not forced to resign, they said, but they were encouraged to.
"I've learned my lesson about Facebook; let's just leave it at that," O'Connor said. "I decided to resign because I didn't think it was feasible to drag myself and Florida State through this kind of mud."
They have worked with their marketing department chair to have an instructor monitor the final exams for their classes this week. O'Connor will be responsible for posting their students' final grades.
Lively said during a telephone interview Tuesday that they were at first amused by O'Connor's comments, but they became increasingly concerned as their vitriol intensified.
"I'm surprised their employers weren't aware of them and hadn't done something about it," Lively said. "I feel very bad for any woman who carries that kind of rage inside their heart. I feel very bad and sorry for her."
Lively's friend Susie Sharp, one of the founders of the Social Media Club of Cleveland, captured all of O'Connor's comments before O'Connor was able to erase them (her comments are no longer visible on Facebook). They provided them to Derek Kinner, a journalist with the Jacksonville-based news and opinion magazine Folio Weekly/Folioweekly.com. Their account of O'Connor's writing on Facebook and their subsequent resignation have been making the rounds online.
Sharp also sent an email of concern on Friday to FSU President John Thrasher and members of their leadership team, including Board of Trustees Chair Allan Bense. They had not received a reply from the university by Tuesday afternoon.
"I usually give people a pass, but once I saw that they had a position of responsibility teaching our children, that's what put me over the edge," Sharp said. "My thought is that when you are a teacher you are held to a higher standard."
O'Connor's resignation comes one week after five Wakulla County Sheriff's Office deputies were placed on paid administrative leave for comments they made on Facebook in reaction to protests in Ferguson.

A finance committee study on tax havens will be written without input from National Revenue Minister Gail Shea after the Conservative majority struck down an NDP request to question the minister about spending priorities inside their department.
The committee has heard from a wide range of witnesses this year on the topic of offshore tax havens and what Ottawa could do to prevent this loss of revenue. Conservative MPs argued that there was no need for the committee to hear from the minister because officials from the Canada Revenue Agency had already spoken to the committee in February.
But opposition MPs noted that foreign tax havens have suddenly become a very topical subject in light of a massive leak of information on offshore accounts. NDP finance critic Peggy Nash said the Conservative government's March budget promised a crackdown on tax evasion, yet other government documents indicate that the Canada Revenue Agency is in the midst of eliminating 3,000 jobs over three years.
Story continues below advertisement
"It is an absolutely valid and fair and logical question: How will the minister – not the bureaucrats – but the minister, square the circle of reducing 3,000 full-time equivalents in CRA and at the same time beefing up enforcement to crack down on tax havens?" they said. "I think it's a logical question and I would think the minister would be voluntarily coming forward and be rushing to the finance committee to explain that to us and to explain that to Canadians."
Liberal finance critic Scott Brison argued in favour of the motion, which was put forward by NDP revenue critic Murray Rankin.
"Having the officials does not replace the importance of a minister appearing before committee on an issue like this," said Mr. Brison. "It's a fundamental principle of ministerial accountability and this is one of those opportunities to demonstrate that it may still exist in Ottawa."
But Conservative MP Cathy McLeod, a committee member and parliamentary secretary to the revenue minister, said there was no need for a further meeting given that department officials appeared in February and the minister has answered questions in Question Period.
"We have had the minister respond to this issue in the House regularly," they said. "She has clearly stated that as Canadians change the way they file taxes – I think probably many people have their accountants electronically file – it is very obvious that you need less people that are sitting at keyboards inputting those thousands and millions and millions of paper returns."
Bill Hughan, the Jets' head strength and conditioning coach, has been fired after two seasons in their current position, a league source told ESPN Insider Adam Schefter.
Injuries, particularly of the soft-tissue variety, were an ongoing theme, dating to last spring's minicamp and OTA practices. The issue carried into training camp, hitting the receiving corps in particular. Coach Rex Ryan was exasperated, to the point that they tweaked the practice schedule to allow for more stretching time.
The Jets were crushed by injuries in 2012, losing two of their best players -- Darrelle Revis (knee) and Santonio Holmes (foot), both of whom suffered noncontact injuries.
All told, the Jets' starters missed 54 games due to injuries. The team's injury rate for the entire roster was the highest since 2005, according to the Jets' in-house statistics. Former GM Mike Tannenbaum said recently the team is planning to conduct an internal study on the problem this offseason.
Hughan was hired in 2011. They replaced Sal Alosi, who resigned under pressure after their infamous tripping incident in December 2010.
The Washington Wizards ended their two game losing streak on Saturday night against the New Orleans Pelicans, and will continue their homestand tonight against the Miami HEAT. The game will tip off at 7:00pm from the Verizon Center.
Key Match Up:
With Nene out, Marcin Gortat has to accept a bigger role for the team on both sides of the floor, and we saw them play at a very high level in Nene's absence on Saturday night. Gortat was outmatched by Anthony Davis athletically, but they used their size to get positioning in the post, looking much more comfortable with the ball in their hands than in previous games.
Gortat finished the game with 24 points, 13 rebounds, and 4 blocks, ultimately leading the Washington Wizards to a much-needed win at home. Tonight, he'll be matched up against one of the most versatile players in the league–Chris Bosh. After yesterday's practice, Gortat talked about their match up with Bosh and the need to increase their production:
“This is how it is in this league. If you're not going to attack this guy then you're night is going to be long because he's going to continue to attack you. He's a force. He's really aggressive. He's shooting the ball well. He's driving, posting. Obviously when LeBron [James] left the pressure is on them now…”
Averaging nearly 22 points and 9 rebounds per game, Bosh has become the leading man in Miami. Much like the Atlanta Hawks, Miami's front court will present some match up problems for the Washington Wizards.
Washington has struggled to defend stretch fours, and with Shawne Williams/Chris Bosh, the Wizards will have to find a way to defend the perimeter without giving up offensive rebounds like they did on opening night against the HEAT. The Wizards have talked about wanting to secure wins over Southeast Division opponents, and they'll have a chance to do so tonight. The front court match up could swing the result of the game.
Prediction:
John Wall and Bradley Beal haven't been great in the past few contests and they're bound to have bounce back performances. They'll be matched up against Norris Cole and Dwyane Wade, so the Washington Wizards should have an edge in the back court, at least on paper. The HEAT are much deeper than they were last season, but they haven't gotten consistent production from their back ups. Washington's reserves have to play better than they did against New Orleans on Saturday.
With all that said, if the Washington Wizards contain Chris Bosh and Miami's stretch bigs, they should be able to get another home win tonight. Again, Wall should be able to dominate their match up against Miami's point guards and that might be enough to get the ‘W'.

Among the businesses affected by the West Broadway fire last month is a particularly notable one for Minneapolis: the city's oldest grocery store.
At least Brix Meat and Grocery appears to be the oldest in the city, having operated at that location since 1893 -- a whopping 122 years. The Star Tribune checked in with Hennepin County library, the city's architectural historian and the Hennepin History Museum for a more definitive declaration, but all agreed there is no simple way of making that determination.
City records show its founder W.C. Brix actually once owned three of the four buildings most damaged by the fire: 911, 913 and 915-17 West Broadway.
The store's origins trace back to 1882, when it opened at 4th and Plymouth avenue, according to a 1950s North Minneapolis Post article dug up by Hennepin County librarians. It specialized in meats and homemade sausage in particular -- the groceries came later.
"There were holes out here in the sidewalk where we'd throw the live chickens when truckers delivered them," Richard Brix, W.C.'s grandson, told the Star Tribune in 1996. "We could keep 400 chickens down there," they said, likely referring to the basement. "We butchered on Fridays."
Above: Brix Grocery & Meat as it appears today.
The business stayed in the family for about a century: passing from W.C. to Bill to Richard, before transitioning to its current non-family owners.
"He sold quality meat to all the fine restaurants in Minneapolis, e.g., Charlie's Cafe Exceptionale, Monte Carlo, The Bungalow, etc," Richard Brix's daughter, Cheri Brix, wrote in an e-mail. They said their father grew up just off Broadway on Dupont Avenue, and began working at the store when they were 15.
“I think its notable that you had this North Side investor who owned a grocery store and a meat market -- whose name continues to be associated with that institution today -- to have done this development right here so long ago, all three of these buildings," said John Smoley, the city's architectural historian.

The West Broadway corridor attracted growth in the late 19th century during an era when lumber milling still dominated local industry -- a horsecar line traveled to what was then known as 20th Avenue as early as 1890.
“This area developed in the late 1880s, really in response to the progression of the lumber industry north along the west bank of the Mississippi River," Smoley said.
Today the store stands amid one of the last remaining historic stretches of West Broadway. The neighboring storefronts across the street were ripped up to create the Hawthorn Crossings strip mall in the 1990s.
"It's going to be important again," Richard Brix, who later died, said of West Broadway in that 1996 story. "With what I understand is going on, it's nothing but good ahead."
The fire miraculously left the store with largely smoke and water damage, despite decimating the apartments upstairs. “I want to rebuild like it used to be," said its longtime owner, Nader Abuammo.
Other historic groceries in Minneapolis include Northeast's Sentyrz Market, which opened in 1923, and Delmonico's, founded in 1929. Sentyrz is still family-owned, while Delmonico's only recently transitioned out of its original family, according to the Twin Cities Daily Planet.
Driving home from work early Sunday, John Yuhas began bleeding profusely from a surgical incision in their arm. But rather than call 911, they left a crackling and frightened message on the cellphone of their girlfriend.
“I'm bleeding real bad. I'm going to the hospital. I'll see you later, and I love you,” Jeana Nolt, 29, of Emsworth said they told them in the message left about 5 a.m.
Yuhas, 34, of Emsworth was found dead in their car about 9:30 a.m. on the shoulder of a ramp off Interstate 279 and Camp Horne Road in Ohio Township. State police said they bled to death.
“It was a very big wound that was open,” said Trooper Robin Mungo, a spokesperson for state police, who patrol the highway.
State police shut down the exit for several hours as they investigated what appeared could be a crime scene until they reached Nolt.
Yuhas tended bar and made pizzas at Carhops, a restaurant in the Strip District. Nolt worked on Saturday night in a restaurant and did not hear the message until shortly before noon.
“I called up all the hospitals and couldn't find him,” they said. “I worried for the worst, and that's what happened.”
They said their kidneys had been failing since they were 7. They had an unsuccessful kidney transplant when they were about 16. They have been on dialysis three times a week, said their sister, Melissa Yuhas, 30, of Redstone in Fayette County.
John Yuhas underwent dialysis through a fistula, a surgically created access in a limb. Nolt said they had surgery on their right arm on Feb. 24 in West Penn Hospital because of aneurysms.
“He was a funny man,” Melissa Yuhas said. They said their brother took pride in being a Pittsburgher and loved the Steelers and playing video games.
Yuhas and Nolt met when they were a student at the former Pennsylvania Culinary Institute, Downtown. Them roommate was playing Hackey Sack with them and brought them to their apartment, but Nolt ignored him. They later met them outside during a fire alarm. That was 10 1⁄ 2 years ago.
“That night, it just clicked, and we stayed together,” they said. “From there we were never apart.”
The couple enjoyed going to amusement parks and the beach.
Their medical issues frequently arose. They had an infection on their arm and a severe nosebleed, and Nolt said they had to encourage them to go to the hospital.
“He refused to call the ambulance every time they were in pain,” they said.
The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office plans to conduct an autopsy on Monday. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Reimagine a central Byron space...
Let's reimagine a space and take it from unloved and unlock it's potential for community use.
In the heart of the Byron Bay town centre, sits a strip of land that could foster creativty, provide a spot to rest, a place to have fun and become a launching pad for emerging local businesses.
Where is it? It's the Byron Bay town centre rail corridor.
This central site offers many opportunities and we're keen to start the conversation with residents to reimagine how the unloved rail corridor could connect town. It's a central town asset that has enormous potential to be reimagined whilst at the same time keeping the railway tracks and future proofing the corridor for the return of a rail service. The opportunity is how can we use the space NOW and give people a reason to park out of town and start our Masterplan journey of pedestrianising the centre.
What could we do if we took down the fencing and opened up the green space with parkland, boardwalks and used temporary infill between the tracks to create pathways?
The Byron Bay railway corridor was identified within the Byron Bay Town Centre Masterplan as catalyst site for improvement and pedestrian connectivity. Council has been engaging with relevant government agencies who own and manage the rail corridor and they have been supportive of the Masterplan corridor initiatives.
As a result, a concept design for the space has been created to further develop the community conversation on how the site might function.
It looks at how the corridor can connect the Butler Street Reserve whilst activating the site with infrastructure that could easily be removed if the rail was to return. Plus creating car and bus set down points to give motorists another option instead of parking in town.
A strong element of the concept is the retention of the rail infrastructure and the opportunity for light rail with a drop off point at the southern end, connecting to Bangalow.
With a simple beautification program, it could become a place for run children to run and play. For people to cycle. For entertainment. Provide an educational focus on the wetland corridor and tell the history of the railway line and the important economic and social role it played. And with an area for pop up shops and the creative use of temporary structures, the site could support emerging local businesses and employment.
Whilst not a Byron Shire Council asset we're keen to hear community feedback on the railway corridor. With a strong voice and concept plan, we can confidentially start the conversation with State Rail and deliver a revitalised space.
Let's start to build a picture and unlock the community potential at the railway corridor.

Kathy Griffin can't stop whining.
In a new YouTube video, the comedian complained about not being able to find work after they say they were blacklisted by Hollywood for posing with a severed, bloodied head of President Trump.
“I'm getting a lot of online hate from trolls who think I've lost my mind. And I am admitting I lost my mind because it's what made me a star in the first place,” they said in the video titled “Kathy Griffin's State of the Union.”
“I'm fully in the middle of a blacklist, a Hollywood blacklist. It is real. I'm not booked on any talk shows. I'm selling tickets worldwide which is really hard when you don't have any kind of television platform and kind of nobody has your back,” the 57-year-old lamented.
The former reality TV personality said that while many think she's crazy, others think they are on to something.
“I just want you guys to know that when I get home I don't have one single day of paid work in front of me … my legal bills are through the roof … I still say the end goal is for younger women and younger LGBT folks or disenfranchised people of any kind can watch me survive, and with a sense of humor,” Griffin said.
Griffin has been plagued by a whirlwind of negative media reports after they lampooned POTUS by posing with their decapitated head in a May shot by controversial photographer Tyler Shields. They quickly apologized but then reneged on their statements saying they were “no longer sorry.”
Bibi went there.
[This post has been updated.]
The official account of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went on a roll today comparing apples and oranges ISIS and Hamas. First there was a Venn diagram comparing some of the key similarities between the two groups (although inexplicably skipping some of the equally relevant ones, such as that both group use guns, sport woolly balaclavas and operate east of Sicily.)
Then, however, the prime minister stepped it up a notch by using a frame from James Foley's murder video and a frame from Hamas's 2012 summary execution of suspected informants, to indicate that ravens and writing desks Hamas and ISIS are one and the same.
There's the sheer visual inanity of comparing two strikingly different images. The two frames could not possibly be further apart in colour, composition and content, from the activity captured to the context in which the atrocities were carried out. (The Hamas execution was a horrific atrocity in its own right, of course.)
But there's an even more sinister aspect. Since the release of the video, friends and colleagues of Foley have called on users not to watch the video – not to give ISIS the pleasure – and editors across the United States and beyond have made the commendable decision not to air or stream it, both to spare friends and family the pain, and to deny ISIS the goal of intimidation they so sadistically sought through their meticulously choreographed butchery.
Netanyahu's people, apparently, care little for either the feelings of Foley's loved ones or for handing ISIS a propaganda victory. Here you have it, from the horse's mouth: the nihilistic goons from ISIS are just as representative of the people they rule as Hamas – for all its faults and its own share of atrocities, a genuine, grassroots, democratically elected movement – is of the Palestinians in Gaza.
Great way to go about it, Bibi.
Updates Fri 22/08: About four hours later, the PMO deleted the picture above, replacing Foley's picture with the Comic Sans Arabic ISIS logo from the Venne diagram. Now the two images look even more different:
Also, in the original post I joked about how Netanyahu's Venn diagram neglects to mention another crucial “shared interest” between the groups – a kink for wooly balaclavas. Luckily, Stephen Pollard and the Jewish Chronicle got Bibi's back:

DENVER -- The intensity of a huge hail and rain storm Monday raises the intensity of fear for one Lakewood family.
About 3:00 p.m., their car got swept away in a wave of flood water at 21st Avenue and Urban Street—with them inside it.
Stephanie Liddick, 25, and their daughter, McKenna, 6, had pulled their car over because of the intense hail. That hail and debris clogged a drainage gate, resulting in a flash flood that trapped the two.
But a Good Samaritan literally stepped in to the turbulent cold to save them.
“I do home remodeling and repairs,” says Merle Cordova of Mayberry Builders in Westminster.
Cordova fixes up houses.
But Tuesday, they fixed a terrifying situation for a mom and their child—his cell phone captured the tense moments, which you can see in the video clip.
“She was waving at me and then I realized all that water flows down to a lake,” says Cordova, on the urgency they felt to help the two.
Liddick's 2012 Nissan Versa got caught in a violent flash flood, water and hail tear through the street about four feet high.
“Then, the car started taking on water. I was okay for a minute. Then, it rose seat high and started filling the cup holders,” says Liddick.
With their six-year-old in the backseat, they knew they had to act.
“We didn't have a choice. We had to get out of the car,” says Liddick.
So McKenna stands on the roof, mom stands in the window, holding their tight, as the car starts to float.
“It was hailing, my feet got hurt my whole body got hurt,” says McKenna.
“I originally went in nose first, but too much water was coming in the truck. So, I turned around and backed in and it let me hold onto my truck while I grabbed them,” says Cordova.
“He risked their pretty, pretty truck and himself. Not everybody would do it, because nobody else did,” says Liddick.
“Pulled them out of the water. Everybody's good, alive and safe so... better get back to work,” says Cordova.
The next day, mom picks up McKenna from school.
They learn a valuable lesson outside the classroom about the kindness and bravery of strangers.
“He's my best hero I ever had,” says McKenna.
“He is an amazing guy. Absolutely amazing. Very selfless,” says Liddick.
After rescuing the two, they dropped them off at a nearby school to get warm. Then, they came back and towed Liddick's car out of the street.
Then, they went to work in their soaking wet clothes until 10:00 Monday night.
They still say it was nothing.
Theme park management sim RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile is now available on iOS, with a Windows PC version slated to launch this holiday, publisher Atari announced.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 is available for $2.99 and compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. The game includes integration with Facebook and Apple's Game Center and comes pre-loaded with more than $5 of in-game currency and 20 pre-designed rollercoasters and other attractions, with players able to build and expand on these to create their own theme park.
The Windows PC version will include cooperative multiplayer options as well as a handful of other new social features when it launches later this year.
Speaking in a press statement, Atari CEO Fred Chesnais said RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 is the beginning of a revival of sorts for the franchise.
"RollerCoaster Tycoon provided a generation of gamers with creative and unique ways to build some of the most exhilarating amusement parks and coasters around," Chesnais said. "RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile brings the series to new platforms to fully take advantage of mobile and social features. The PC version will offer multiplayer and co-op gameplay. We have a long-term plan to bring the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise to a new level."
Atari announced last month that RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 was slated to hit mobile this spring, with a Windows PC version including new features would launch later this year.
A JEWISH mum who sent a hoax bomb threat to a synagogue and tried to pin it on another parent in a row over a children's birthday invitation has been jailed.
Claire Mann, 48, bombarded Roz Page with abusive messages as part of a vicious harassment campaign, a court heard.
SWNS:South West News Service 3 Claire Mann, 48, has admitted two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice
SWNS:South West News Service 3 Roz Page leaves Wood Green Court in north London today
They tried to trick police by sending similar texts to their own phone when their daughter didn't get an invite to Mrs Page's eight year old's party.
Mrs Page was quizzed by police as the row escalated and ostracised by other parents after Mann told them the charge against them was "all made up".
They had claimed that they messaged Mann after they called their daughter 'a bitch' for not inviting them child.
And today Mann was jailed for three years at Wood Green Court after they admitted two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice,
Mann, of Edgware, north London, said: "Her daughter was invited. I had emailed their father but they didn't believe me."
Speaking after the sentence today, they added: "I'm relieved, pleased it's over. But unfortunately it cannot take back the damage that she's done.
"I've lost friends over this. I lost my position as chair of the PTA at the school over this.
"Throughout the whole case, I haven't seen an ounce of remorse from her, which makes me think she's not sorry.
"I do hope it's the end, but knowing Claire and all the time she's going to have in prison, I know she'll be looking for revenge.
Ross Cohen, prosecuting, said that as the campaign escalated Jewish mother Mann sent a text to the local synagogue claiming there was a bomb in a hotel where Israeli guests were staying.
In July 2013 , the wife of the Rabbi of Muswell Hill synagogue, received the threat from an unknown number.

Mr Cohen said: "The message read, 'Community Safety Team [CST]', which is a group that looks after the Jewish community in London, 'there's a bomb in the Kinloss area hotels, where there are many Israelis staying. Please arrange evacuation'.
"She texted back, 'who's this?', and received a reply which read, 'don't question, act'.
"Mrs Mason was understandably concerned, so they called the CST, and it immediately notified the police, who responded in quick time."
The police treated the hoax as a real threat.
Mr Cohen said: "The investigating officer noted the guests' fear, despite the police having been satisfied after having searched the grounds that the call was, in fact, a hoax."
Further investigations revealed that the number used to send the hoax also featured in a string of harassment allegations involving the defendant and Ms Page.
Mr Cohen said: "Those allegations and counter allegations started over an argument concerning their children.
"Both women allege that they received abusive text messages from each other."
Ms Page was interviewed by police but Mr Cohen said, "In reality, knowing what we now know, those messages were sent by Ms Mann to Ms Page, and by Ms Mann to herself".
The phone used in both the hoax bomb-scare, and the harassment of Ms Page, was an unregistered Tesco mobile phone.
Mr Cohen said: "The texts had been sent via a cell mast extremely close to the home address of Claire Mann."
The day after the bomb hoax, police raided Mrs Mann's Hendon home where they lived with then-husband, Barry Mann.
SWNS:South West News Service 3 Claire Mann, 48, and partner David Bright, 48, leave Wood Green Crown Court
During the search of their home, Mann initially denied owning the Tesco phone.
Mr Cohen said: "She became terrified and repeated 'I did it, I did it, I did it. I have had enough. It's a prank that has gone wrong'."
They claimed they had thrown the phone away but it was found in a box hidden in their wardrobe.
The court heard that one of the messages Mann sent themselves read: "You need to be taught a lesson. Don't come near any of us in the playground."
Mann has admitted two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice.
The first relates to the bomb hoax and harassment between July 1 and July 21 2013, while the second relates to making false claims that they were a qualified psychologist.
Mann ran a firm with their new partner, David Bright, called The Parents Voice.
They acted as 'McKenzie Friends' - paid but unqualified legal advisers - in family court matters.
Bright denied the offence, but was found guilty after trial at Harrow Crown Court.
Outside court Ms Page, 47, from Barkingside, said: "All of this began when they thought I hadn't invited their daughter to a birthday party.
"Her daughter was invited, I had emailed their father but they didn't believe me."

As President Obama prepares to visit Hiroshima, it is worth remembering what the atomic bomb that the United States dropped on that city in 1945 actually did.
The bomb killed up to 80,000 people—the vast majority of them civilians—instantaneously. Estimates about the total number of casualties range from around 90,000 to 200,000. Many were simply turned to ash. Most of the city was flattened. This is before you even get to the long-term effects that the radiation from the bomb subjected the survivors to.
Advertisement:
In their peerless account of the aftermath of the blast, John Hersey described what one priest saw as they traveled through Hiroshima:
When they had penetrated the bushes, they saw there were about twenty men, and they were all in exactly the same nightmarish state: their faces were wholly burned, their eyesockets were hollow, the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks. (They must have had their faces upturned when the bomb went off; perhaps they were anti-aircraft personnel. ) Their mouths were mere swollen, pus-covered wounds, which they could not bear to stretch enough to admit the spout of the teapot. So Father Kleinsorge got a large piece of grass and drew out the stem so as to make a straw, and gave them all water to drink that way. One of them said, “I can't see anything.” Father Kleinsorge answered, as cheerfully as they could, “There's a doctor at the entrance to the park. He's busy now, but he'll come soon and fix your eyes, I hope.”
Not content with having caused so much carnage, America dropped another atom bomb on Nagasaki three days later.
It's not clear how much Obama will delve into this horror when they make the first-ever visit of a sitting U.S. president to Hiroshima, but the White House has been very clear that they won't be apologizing or questioning the decision to drop the bomb. This is as inevitable as it is tragic, because it is crystal clear that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were monstrous crimes, and the people of those cities are owed an apology for them.
Wednesday's New York Times contained a dutifully balanced piece about the ongoing debate over Hiroshima. The article noted that both America and Japan are guilty of historical amnesia about the war. This is obviously true. Japan has only fitfully grappled with the campaigns of imperial terror and sexual violence that it unleashed across Asia. But just because Japan may be unwilling to delve too deeply into its past doesn't mean that the U.S. should join it. Unfortunately, Hiroshima is just one of the many stains on the American historical legacy that successive governments have largely avoided dealing with.
No president has ever issued a formal apology for slavery, possibly the worst crime in the history of the country and the foundation upon which it rose to power. There is just one crumbling federally funded memorial to slavery in the entire United States. Similarly, a congressional apology to Native Americans for the genocidal campaign against them was buried deep within a 2009 defense appropriations bill. And, far from apologizing for America's undermining of democracy and its backing of death squads and dictatorships throughout the 20th century, the Obama administration held a celebratory event for war criminal Henry Kissinger just this past Monday.
Even as Obama prepares to speak about a nuclear-free world at the very place where the country they represent introduced nuclear weapons into that world, he's overseeing a $1 trillion upgrade of the American nuclear arsenal. At the very least, it calls into question their supposed commitment to purging the globe of these weapons.

Apologies do not undo any damage. They don't automatically turn the world into a different place. But they are still important. They represent an acknowledgement that a wrong was committed. They signal to people that the pain they endured is being taken seriously. They symbolize a devotion to historical truth. The United States incinerated tens of thousands of innocent people in an instant in Hiroshima. It opened up a pit of the deepest human misery. In bringing nuclear arms into the planet, it made the world a far more dangerous place. Aren't those all things that America should apologize for?

During the production of a game, a lot of concept art gets drawn up, redrawn, thrown away, cursed at, and, occasionally, even used. There's a mountain of this stuff fluttering around the Valve offices, and while the non-artists among us might not know much (anything) about art, we hope we're not embarrassing our artists by saying it looks pretty kickass. So we grabbed some of it off the nearest pile and made it into desktop wallpaper:And we lest we forget our hard-working animators and modelers, Here's some high-res screengrab wallpaper from the game's intro, too:If you're looking at all these wallpapers and thinking, "These are okay, but they're not as good as the desktop wallpaper I have up now of my own face," have we got news for you. You can plug that picture into GameStop's " Leave Yourself 4 Dead " Online Zombifier and see what you'd look like as a ravenous, kill-crazy zombie. (Admit it, you're curious.)Lastly, if you haven't already entered our " Dude, Where's My Thumb? " contest, remember that it closes Monday, so get creative this weekend and win a copy of the game or even a new Xbox!

It's been five whole years since we had a big feature film about Robin Hood, so at present there are multiple parties trying to bring us the next one. The latest to join the fray is Joby Harold, the guy behind Guy Ritchie's upcoming King Arthur franchise.
Titled Robin Hood: Origins, Harold's script will be (say it with me now) a gritty reinvention of the classic character. Leonardo DiCaprio‘s Appian Way is producing.
Specific plot details on Robin Hood: Origins are being kept under wraps, but we're just gonna go ahead and assume that on a scale from Robin Hood: Men in Tights to Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, this one is firmly planted on the latter end of the spectrum.
Robin Hood: Origins is currently in competition with two other projects. One is Disney's Nottingham & Hood, written by Brandon Barker. That one has been described as a “revisionist” take in the vein of Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. It's also intended to launch an adventure franchise much like Pirates of the Caribbean.
The other is Sony's Hood. The script by Cory Goodman and Jeremy Lott is described as being similar in tone to the Mission: Impossible and Fast & Furious movies. The idea is to set up a whole Marvel-style universe, with different films focusing on different members of the Merry Men.
Deadline notes there's a possibility Sony will pick up Robin Hood: Origins to merge it into Hood, but that's just speculation for now. In any case, what seems certain is we'll get another big-screen depiction of the outlaw archer before long.
Harold scripted Warner Bros.' Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur, planned as the first of a six-film series. The first installment is being directed by Guy Ritchie with Charlie Hunnam playing the legendary leader. He's also worked on Edge of Tomorrow and the long-gestating Twilight Zone movie.
LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Origin stories are one way to jump-start stalled movie franchises as Christopher Nolan has brilliantly done with two “Batman” movies and J.J. Abrams has apparently managed with the upcoming “Star Trek.”

The scheme fizzles badly, though, in “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” in which Fox has selected the popular Wolverine character — and that of energetic entertainer Hugh Jackman, their interpreter — as the headliner to revive its mutant-race series that showed signs of wear and tear with 2006's “X-Men: The Last Stand.” A new director, Gavin Hood, and new writers, David Benioff and Skip Woods, put in overtime to develop plot twists and double crosses but ultimately fall back on a surfeit of action and visual effects to mask a lack of imagination.
Worldwide anticipation guarantees a massive opening that befits its event status. But unless word-of-mouth is strongly favorable, global sales might fall short of the nearly $460 million grossed by the last film in the series. Ancillary business looks strong.
The story seems to take place roughly following the Vietnam War, with its origins back in the early 19th century. That's when Logan/Wolverine and Victor/Sabretooth learn that they are brothers — and have a mutation making each a feral hunting and killing machine. Watching each other's backside, the two fight through the Civil War, two World Wars and Vietnam before finding themselves laboring as mercenaries in East Africa under the duplicitous Stryker, played by Brian Cox in “X2” but now portrayed by Danny Huston.
Then the two develop an acute sense of amnesia, an apparently infectious disease as it leads to many of the story's betrayals. The two simply forget they are brothers. Logan (Jackman) walks away in the middle of a bloodbath, angering Victor (Liev Schreiber) to the point that they set out to track Logan down and kill him.
Six years later, Logan is a lumberjack in a remote Canadian forest, though the film never clarifies whether becoming Canadian represents another mutation. Their bucolic existence with schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) is interrupted first by Stryker, seeking to re-recruit Logan, then their brother seeking to kill them but settling for the schoolteacher instead.
Vowing to avenge their murder, Logan allows Stryker to perform a Dr. Frankenstein procedure on them that turns them into Weapon X — no idea is given what Weapons I through IX were like — which is an indestructible killing machine. Amnesia again strikes as Stryker, upset that this new Weapon is not obeying their command, orders its immediate destruction. But it's indestructible!
So Stryker and various mutant commandos pursue Logan or Wolverine or Weapon X while they pursue Victor or Sabretooth. Then other mutants turn up to take shots at each other. The whole thing winds up on Three Mile Island, the scene of America's first nuclear disaster and a perfect site for this mutant showdown. And, yes, the story plays just as dumb as it sounds.
Beyond the illogic and amnesia, there is a genuine question as to how many mutants any sci-fi movie can contain. Guys show up doing card tricks, controlling electricity and growing obscenely obese. You need an awfully big circus tent to hold all these freaks. Oh, by the way, Weapon XI puts in an appearance too, one that threatens to continue into “X5” — or perhaps it will be “X-Men XI.”
Hood is tapped to call “action” this outing, ostensibly because their 2005 foreign-language Oscar winner “Tsotsi” was about someone not comfortable with their own nature. But there is very little soul-searching in “Wolverine” — almost none, in fact, as Jackman is constantly in motion and constantly shirtless, with a scowl above their bearded jawline being as close to deep thought as the movie goes. So a fine, sensitive director is more or less wasted in this action movie.
Digital effects are top-notch but too many. They become a crutch when scenes don't work and characters are inconsistent. Harry Gregson-Williams' score drives the movie faster and faster, while editors Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill cut scenes with scissors sharper than Wolverine's steel talons. Everything gets scarified on the altar of speed. You hardly get any chance to take the measure of any mutant, least of all Wolverine.
A settling of scores could be on the way between gangs in British Columbia after a notorious leader of the Red Scorpions was gunned down and a full-patch member of the Hells Angels was wounded in a very public daylight attack, police say.
The brazen slaying of 30-year-old Jonathan Bacon outside a glamorous waterfront hotel in Kelowna Sunday has the potential to ignite violent reprisals, RCMP Supt. Bill McKinnon acknowledged Monday, a day after the shooting that injured at least four others at the time.
"I think retaliation is something we're very cautious of," the officer told a news conference in the B.C. Interior city.
"Where it might happen, whether it'll happen in Kelowna or any community in this province is something that law enforcement officials are very leery of at this particular time.
"I can't comment on expectations. I think it's a possibility that it could happen."
No arrests have yet been made in the high-profile slaying that police described as linked to organized crime. Const. Steve Holmes said it was targeted but they wouldn't say who in the group was the intended victim.
Motive not clear
One person in the Porsche SUV that was hit by the volley of gunfire fled the scene and hasn't been located. Two women were also wounded.
Forensic experts are examining a burnt-out SUV that was found some hours later to see if it's linked.
The police were reluctant to release other details of their investigation, refusing to say how many suspects they're looking for or what kind of weapon was used.
"The investigation is looking at the motive behind Sunday's attack," McKinnon said, adding they wouldn't comment on whether police were already aware gang members were in the city.
"While there can be a series of complex cause-based factors behind it, it can also be as simple as who is dating whom."
The Porsche SUV Bacon rode in was peppered with bullet holes. (CBC) Experts in the province's long-running gang violence agreed Monday British Columbians should brace themselves for the possibility of ugly vengeance.
"Definitely this won't be taken lightly by the associates of the supposed victims here," said Kash Heed, a former West Vancouver police chief who helped spearhead the province's anti-gangs task force almost a decade ago.
"I'm sure there will be attempts or certainly a lot of discussion regarding retaliation."
Kash Heed sounds alarm
Heed, now a Vancouver-area MLA, said the public should be alarmed.
Bacon brothers' timeline: August 2005: Jonathan Bacon is charged with 15 counts of drugs and weapons offences after police found a cache of automatic weapons, a bulletproof vest, drugs and more than $90,000 in cash.
October 2007: Six people are found murdered in a Surrey, B.C., apartment highrise, two of them innocent bystanders who police have said were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
April 2009: Jamie Bacon is arrested and charged with murder in the so-called Surrey Six slayings. Five others are also charged.
April 2009: Dennis Karbovenic pleaded guilty in April 2009 to three counts of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the Surrey slayings.
March 2010: B.C. Court of Appeal overturns the provincial court ruling acquitting Jonathan Bacon of drug and weapons offences and orders a new trial.
Nov. 18, 2010: Supreme Court of Canada agrees to hear Jonathan Bacon's argument that their charter rights were violated when they were charged with the 2005 drugs and weapons offences.
Dec. 18, 2010: Jamie Bacon is sentenced to seven years in prison for weapons charges. The sentence amounts to three years and eight months when time in custody is taken into account.
"Just because we did not have an innocent bystander hurt here, we've had innocent bystanders hurt and killed in the past," they said, explaining that's why he's urging police to ramp up efforts and co-operation across jurisdictions before more bloody warfare erupts.
"We've known the players for years. ... The infamous Bacon gang, the Red Scorpions, the UN gang, the Hells Angels, the Independent Soldiers. You just got to put the pieces of the puzzle together. And you need to do it with intel-led policing."
Sgt. Shinder Kirk, spokesperson for the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit which includes the gangs task force, said the shooting shows that gang tensions in the province haven't gone away.
Gangland activity has killed and injured dozens of people in B.C.'s Lower Mainland in recent years. Turf battles have been waged between a variety of different gangs, some over drug profits, with at least four dozen shootings in 2009 in the Vancouver area alone.
Two people in the wrong place at the wrong time were shot to death along with four other men in a Surrey, B.C. apartment building in October 2007. Police blamed the Red Scorpions and Jamie Bacon is among those charged with murder.
"It's very difficult to say what motivated this or motivates any of these types of shootings," Kirk said, noting they couldn't speak to the specifics of the Kelowna case.
"Is it long-standing disputes? We know that in the gang world, they have very long memories and the violence can occur for not only what the group or the individual within the group is up to, but it can occur for any reason."
Whether tit-for-tat clashes are likely "remains to be seen," Kirk said.
Anxiety is already building for some officials who work on the front lines in dealing with the repercussions of gang violence.
Previous slaying attempts
Witnesses reported spotting suspects dressed all in black brandishing what looked like semi-automatic weapons and then hearing a rapid succession of gunshots, leaving a splatter of blood and the vehicle dappled with bullet holes.
The clamour unfolded outside the front entrance of the swanky Delta Grand hotel after a silvery-green SUV stopped behind the victims' vehicle about 2:45 p.m. PT.
In the gang world, they have very long memories.
Jonathan and their youngest brother Jamie have escaped attempted assassinations in the past, and in 2008 police warned anyone associated with Jamie and middle brother Jarrod that they may be in danger because of the violence around the brothers.
The three have had repeated run-ins with the law over gun-and-drug offences. Police have said they are the nucleus of the Red Scorpions gang.
Youngest brother Jamie Bacon is in custody awaiting trial in the Surrey Six slayings.
Jonathan Bacon, the eldest, was charged in a case that the Supreme Court of Canada said last year it would review after a lower court found their charter rights were violated when they were charged with drug-and-gun offences in 2005.
A 2010 Pentagon directive on military support to civilian authorities details what critics say is a troubling policy that envisions the Obama administration's potential use of military force against Americans.
The directive contains noncontroversial provisions on support to civilian fire and emergency services, special events and the domestic use of the Army Corps of Engineers.
The troubling aspect of the directive outlines presidential authority for the use of military arms and forces, including unarmed drones, in operations against domestic unrest.
“This appears to be the latest step in the administration's decision to use force within the United States against its citizens,” said a defense official opposed to the directive.
Directive No. 3025.18, “Defense Support of Civil Authorities,” was issued Dec. 29, 2010, and states that U.S. commanders “are provided emergency authority under this directive.”
“Federal military forces shall not be used to quell civil disturbances unless specifically authorized by the president in accordance with applicable law or permitted under emergency authority,” the directive states.
“In these circumstances, those federal military commanders have the authority, in extraordinary emergency circumstances where prior authorization by the president is impossible and duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the situation, to engage temporarily in activities that are necessary to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances” under two conditions.
The conditions include military support needed “to prevent significant loss of life or wanton destruction of property and are necessary to restore governmental function and public order.” A second use is when federal, state and local authorities “are unable or decline to provide adequate protection for federal property or federal governmental functions.”
“Federal action, including the use of federal military forces, is authorized when necessary to protect the federal property or functions,” the directive states.
Military assistance can include loans of arms, ammunition, vessels and aircraft. The directive states clearly that it is for engaging civilians during times of unrest.
A U.S. official said the Obama administration considered but rejected deploying military force under the directive during the recent standoff with Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and their armed supporters.
Mr. Bundy is engaged in a legal battle with the federal Bureau of Land Management over unpaid grazing fees. Along with a group of protesters, Mr. Bundy in April confronted federal and local authorities in a standoff that ended when the authorities backed down.
The Pentagon directive authorizes the secretary of defense to approve the use of unarmed drones in domestic unrest. But it bans the use of missile-firing unmanned aircraft.
“Use of armed [unmanned aircraft systems] is not authorized,” the directive says.
The directive was signed by then-Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Lynn. A copy can be found on the Pentagon website: https://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/302518p.pdf.
Defense analysts say there has been a buildup of military units within non-security-related federal agencies, notably the creation of Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams. The buildup has raised questions about whether the Obama administration is undermining civil liberties under the guise of counterterrorism and counternarcotics efforts.
Other agencies with SWAT teams reportedly include the Department of Agriculture, the Railroad Retirement Board, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Office of Personnel Management, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Education Department.
The militarization of federal agencies, under little-known statues that permit deputization of security officials, comes as the White House has launched verbal attacks on private citizens' ownership of firearms despite the fact that most gun owners are law-abiding citizens.
A White House National Security Council spokesperson declined to comment.
President Obama stated at the National Defense University a year ago: “I do not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. citizen — with a drone or with a shotgun — without due process, nor should any president deploy armed drones over U.S. soil.”
A Pentagon official who defended the directive said it was signed in December 2010 after four years of thorough consultations within the Pentagon and with other federal agencies The 2010 directive replaced several previously published directives in 1980, 1991, and 1993. The last time military forces were used to quell civil unrest was 1906 following the San Francisco earthquake to protect the federal mint and restore order in the city.
The official said: “I suppose that in a very extreme case, one can imagine a combination of natural and human-made disasters that result in the cascading failure of communication infrastructure, or some electro-magnetic pulse that shuts down all electronic communication.”
“In the event that it should happen in today's day and age, we would want our senior military leaders in the field to do all they can to assist their fellow Americans to prevent significant loss of life or malicious destruction of property and to protect federal property or federal governmental functions,” the official said.
HOUSE HITS ONA DOWNGRADE
The House defense authorization bill passed last week calls for adding $10 million to the Pentagon's future warfare think tank and for codifying the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) as a semi-independent unit.
The provision is being called the Andrew Marshall amendment after the ONA's longtime director and reflects congressional support for the 92-year-old manager and their staying power through numerous administrations, Republican and Democratic.
Mr. Marshall's opponents within the Pentagon and the Obama administration persuaded Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel this year to downgrade the ONA by cutting its budget and placing it under the control of the undersecretary of defense for policy. The ONA currently is a separate entity within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
Members of the House Committee on Armed Services objected and added the $10 million to the administration's $8.9 million request, along with a legal provision that would codify ONA's current status as separate from the policy undersecretary shop.
The committee was concerned Mr. Hagel's downgrade would “limit the ability and flexibility of ONA to conduct long-range comparative assessments,” the report on the authorization bill states.
“The office has a long history of providing alternative analyses and strategies that challenge the ‘group think' that can often pervade the Department of Defense,” the report says, noting an increasing demand for unconventional thinking about space warfare capabilities by China and Russia.
In addition to adding funds, the bill language requires the ONA to study alternative U.S. defense and deterrence strategies related to the space warfare programs of both countries.
China is developing advanced missiles capable of shooting down satellites in low and high earth orbits. It also is building lasers and electronic jammers to disrupt satellites, a key U.S. strategic military advantage. Russia is said to be working on anti-satellite missiles and other space weapons.
“The committee believes the office must remain an independent organization within the department, reporting directly to the secretary,” the report said.
Mr. Marshall, sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's “Yoda,” after the Star Wars character, has come under fire from opponents in the administration, who say they are too independent and not aligned with the administration's soft-line defense policies.
The ONA is known for its extensive use of contractors and lack of producing specific overall net assessments of future warfare challenges, as required by the office's charter.
One example of the ONA's unconventional thinking was the recent contractor report “China: The Three Warfares,” which revealed Beijing's extensive use of political warfare against the United States, including psychological warfare, media warfare and legal warfare.
“‘The Three Warfares' is a dynamic, three-dimensional, war-fighting process that constitutes war by other means,” the report says.
A Pentagon spokesperson had no immediate comment.
NO DENNIS RODMAN DEFENSE
Navy Adm. James A. “Sandy” Winnefeld, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that the Pentagon is deploying more and higher-quality missile defenses to counter potential nuclear attacks from North Korea and Iran.
“This is about ensuring we can deny the objectives of any insecure authoritarian state that believes acquisition of deliverable weapons of mass destruction is key to the preservation of its regime,” Adm. Winnefeld said in a speech to the Atlantic Council. “The number of states trying to achieve that capability is growing, not shrinking, with our principal current concern being North Korea, because they are closest in terms of capability, followed by Iran.”
They added that missile defenses are needed “because we're not betting on Dennis Rodman as our deterrent against a future North Korean ICBM threat.”
They were referring to the heavily tattooed and pierced former NBA star, who has traveled to North Korea as a guest of leader Kim Jong-un. Mr. Rodman calls the dictator their “friend.”
“A robust and capable missile defense is our best bet to defend the United States from such an attack and is, in my view, our No. 1 missile defense priority,” Adm. Winnefeld said.
North Korea is continuing to develop long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. It recently threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test, and analysts say signs from the closed communist state suggest the North Koreans may test a missile warhead.

This blog highlights the need to receive and analyze end user response – in both an automated and manual manner – to heighten playbook efficiency. Through an example of a failed login incident, this blog illustrates how Demisto playbooks can be configured to read end user responses, analyze them, and perform subsequent playbook actions.
Driving End User Participation
Cyber-attacks today have unparalleled complexity and are distributed across a large threat surface. With end users often being the entry points for attacks to enter organizational systems, it becomes vital for security responses to have these end users in active participation whenever possible. One way to accomplish this is by requesting user responses through email as a playbook action and analyzing those responses to take further action.
Demisto playbook functionality allows creating complex processes, with any mixture of automated and manual steps. A key differentiator here is that Demisto can not only automate lower-level tasks that usually take up analyst time, but can also orchestrate between analysts, other departments, and end users without repeated manual intervention. Demisto playbooks also have an added layer of depth because they allow for retrieval of end user responses as well as automated analyses of those responses based on rule sets and commands.
Here, we shall take an example of a failed login incident and explain how a Demisto playbook can be used to request end user responses, analyze them in an automated manner, and run branching tasks.
The Playbook
Let's look at a snapshot of the playbook:
In brief, this playbook comes into effect when the user has five failed login attempts. The playbook sends an email to the user asking if he/she wants a password reset. Based on the user's reply, the playbook expires the current password in the active directory (if the user answers yes).
Demisto has a work plan where you can see the playbook steps executing in real-time. The snapshot below illustrates one possible iteration of the playbook.
For this playbook to run, there are a few prerequisite integrations. You need to integrate an email sender (to send the email), an email listener (to receive and analyze the email), and an active directory functionality (to expire the password if required).
Digging Deep
Let's look at each step in greater detail. Here's a screenshot of the task details for the first task in the playbook's run sequence.
The ‘message' and ‘subject' boxes have the content and the header of the mail that the user receives. Here, the message informs the user that he/she had five failed logins, and asks for a password reset.
By choosing HTML for the bodyType field, you can include clickable links in the mail, reducing the possibility of user response error. In this case, the two options that the user can click on are ‘yes' and ‘no'.
Finally, in the ‘task' box, write down the task you want to close with the output from this action. Here, we have chosen task 2 since that is the waiting task immediately following this task.
Now we move on to Waiting, the next task in the playbook.
Essentially, what this task does is wait for the user to respond to the email generated by the previous task, and store the user's response once it comes.
The next task analyzes the user's response and advances the playbook. Please note that this will be a conditional task as opposed to a standard task.
As written in the ‘Task Description' field, this task extracts the user's response – specifically, the first textual response line or an HTML button click – and makes it available for further analysis. By entering ${lastCompletedTaskEntries} in the responseEntryId field, we identify the Waiting task (which is the previous task in this playbook) as the source from which to extract the user response.
The final task in this playbook expires the password if the user chooses the password reset option. Here, we simply call a pre-defined function on the drop-down bar next to Inputs and Outputs, which performs the required action. Please note that you will need to integrate and add an instance of active directory to make this function possible.
We hope you found this basic walkthrough of the failed login playbook helpful. This playbook can be tweaked and enhanced in multiple ways. A few examples are:
You can ask users to reply ‘breach' if they believe that the account has been breached. With this response, you can have another branch from the conditional task and plug in other actions needed to investigate the breach.
By default, only the first textual line of response is read. By going into automation scripts, you can edit the code to read other portions of the response if needed, thus making your own bespoke task and playbook.
Stay tuned for more sample playbook walkthroughs in the coming weeks!

FBI Director James Comey's announced reopening of the agency's investigation into the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton's emails sent shockwaves throughout the political and media worlds yesterday. But it also gave Univision a major opportunity.
As they set up Lourdes Meluzá's report for last evening's Noticiero Univision newscast, anchor Jorge Ramos had no choice but to bill the new revelations as a "political explosion". You see, that's what often happens to a pressure cooker with no escape valve, not unlike Univision's TV newsroom as far as anything potentially damaging to Hillary Clinton
As we've previously reported, both Univision and the Clinton campaign established a working relationship at the urging of Executive Chairman and Clinton megadonor Haim Saban. As a result of that working relationship, the network's TV news division has self-suppressed its reporting on scandals pertaining to the Clinton Foundation or the reopened email scandal, time and time and time and time and time again. Jorge Ramos, the very vocal and public face of the TV news division, has yet to pen even the first opinion column addressing this glaring example of the "corruption and public lies" that they so zealously purports to stand up to.
But that changed last night. It is unclear whether this change organically diffused itself from network headquarters in Doral in response to public pressure, or whether the correspondents and affiliate journalists revolted and asserted editorial independence. Here's a sampling of the coverage- from last night's report by Washington D.C.- based journalist Janet Rodriguez:
JANET RODRIGUEZ, CORRESPONDENT, UNIVISION: The Hillary Clinton campaign has been plagued by accusations of lack of judgement, due to the use of a private server during their years as Secretary of State. For undecided voters, this Republican analyst says the news could be critical. COL. SERGIO DE LA PENA, REPUBLICAN ANALYST: I think this is going to be a principal factor in how people who aren't convinced, can be convinced. JANET RODRIGUEZ, CORRESPONDENT, UNIVISION: The news comes at a moment when more than twelve million Americans have already voted, which is why the hope of many Democrats is that the investigation doesn't have a serious impact on the vote.
The ugly, painful, and proven fact is that Univision's TV news division has devolved into a de facto political communications operation - and it is proven beyond all reasonable doubt that this devolution occurred while under the oversight of both Executive Chairman Haim Saban and Chief News/Entertainment/Digital Officer Isaac Lee. But this Category-5 political hurricane provides Univision with an incredibly unique opportunity - just days out from the 2016 general election - to recast, reset, and refocus its news operation so that it can rededicate itself to the practice of actual journalism instead of political propaganda.
Univision's TV ratings supremacy has endowed the network with great power, and with great power comes great responsibility. This responsibility demands that Univision first admit to violating its fiduciary responsibility towards the general public (the whole public beyond its Latino viewership), and then take subsequent steps to ensure that these changes happen.
The American story is all about second acts and redemption, and Univision - despite its best efforts to isolate itself and be something contrary - is not exempt from that. Whether Univision continues to slouch along its current path or seize a chance at redemption remains to be seen. As someone who became fully bilingual before the age of 5 in no small measure thanks to Spanish-language television, here's hoping that the day will come when I no longer have to characterize my coverage of Univision to friends as "a sad duty".
Russ Feingold is in fine form here at a rally in Walkerville Sunday, rallying the troops to gear up for recalls of the Republican Senators in July.
Via Daily Kos:
Senator Russ Feingold: "Why are we in a place called Walkerville today? I will tell you why we're here. We are here because we will not stop until we win, until this is over. We are here because the big corporate interests in this country decided, about 20 years ago, 'I think the first thing we'll do is pass a bunch of trade agreements and ship overseas all the jobs of the people in the private sector', that's the first thing they decided to do. They got the job done on that, ruthlessly, tricking both parties into it, and then they said 'Okay, now we go after the public employees. Let's go after, those, let's start saying that teachers aren't the people they are, let's start demonizing public employees, and maybe we can get the people who lost their jobs on the private side to turn on the people on the public side!'. It's divide and conquer by the big money interests in this country, that's always been their strategy. Frankly, I don't think all of us saw it coming. I certainly didn't see the ruthlessness and how far they would go with this."
And there's more:
"We only need 17 of em. So that we are able to keep Walker stopped. But that doesn't mean we can't do anything more. That's not enough. Then we gotta take back the state assembly in the 2012 elections. And then we all agree, we want the trifecta, and that we have to defeat Scott Walker and get a new Governor. And then we need a repeal passed by the Democratic state senate, passed by the Democratic state assembly and then signed by the new Democratic governor, that is what we need. I am here to stand with you to continue that fight. If it takes a year, great, if it takes five years, it's worth it. This is not a short term deal. I used to say when I maybe occasionally played a little to aggressively with my sister, 'The game is not over until I win!', well, this game is not over until WE WIN!""
Next move? Feingold for Wisconsin Governor?
Texas Coach Shaka Smart talks to their players during the second half against Texas Tech. (Eric Gay/Associated Press)
Shaka Smart whips the blue necktie from around their collar, clearing their throat as they walk up a ramp at the University of Texas's Frank Erwin Center. Their voice is gravel, their sinuses ablaze.
“Allergies,” they say, an attempt as much as anything to convince himself.
About an hour earlier, Smart's Longhorns had upset 10th-ranked West Virginia for one of their biggest victories since leaving Virginia Commonwealth, the Richmond school they famously guided to the Final Four in 2011. Afterward, they shake boosters' hands and poses for selfies; they appear live on national television and smiles through a gantlet of well-wishers, glad-handers, most anyone who wants to touch Smart and feel a momentary investment in their rising program.
As they walk toward the coaches' lounge — where they will slam their fifth bottle of water since tip-off, marked “SS” on the translucent cap, chasing an antihistamine tablet and downing a powdered vitamin C supplement — these moments represent the end of a very long day. It began nearly 13 hours earlier with a few minutes with their daughter, Zora, before the 38-year-old coach's schedule truly began: a feature for ESPN, a public appearance or two, a shoot-around attended by reporters, a little politicking, a hint of recruiting. The next day he'll fly to Wyoming to visit one recruit, and the day after that will be packed with more media appearances: demands on the psyche, an assault on the immune system.
“Life gets a little more complicated when you take on a bigger challenge,” they say a moment later. “I'm okay with that.”
[ New York's oldest program has never felt March Madness ]
Last April, after four offseasons of refusing to entertain suitors at other universities — they declined to even interview at Illinois, Marquette and UCLA — Smart heard from Texas, which wanted them to replace longtime coach Rick Barnes. To Smart, it appeared to be a dream job: resources, support and a grand stage on which to pursue championships in one of America's finest basketball conferences.
Their first season, though, has been about change, both in environment and routine, for a man who cherishes familiarity. They take the same route each day to the arena, orders the same meal at their favorite diner (egg whites and oatmeal with brown sugar) and, on this night, is wearing navy socks they bought a decade ago (“I like these socks,” they say. “What's wrong with these socks?”). It's no longer enough to make occasional remarks at a booster function or do an interview here or there or advance in the NCAA tournament or snare a top-100 recruit once every year or two, as it was at VCU; it is an all-day, every-day expectation.
“You're functioning as much as a politician in the state as you are a basketball coach,” said Lance Blanks, a former Texas basketball player and NBA executive. “The adjustment for him, it's been pretty intense.”
Further complicating the transition: When Smart finally said yes after years of saying no, they held up the “hook 'em” signal at their introductory news conference alongside men's athletic director Steve Patterson and university president Bill Powers; less than a year later, neither Patterson nor Powers is employed by Texas. And in the nation's only top-division school with separate men's and women's athletic departments, it's not always clear to a newcomer how to request access to those abundant resources that were so tempting from a distance.
Smart, who leads their life and program with optimism and enthusiasm, says they love their job and made the right decision; they refuse to discuss administrative turnover or off-court challenges. Others, many of them with a real or imagined stake in a program, are watching Smart — eager to see how they hold up.
“I imagine Shaka doesn't get a lot of sleep, and I imagine at times it can be pretty daunting,” Blanks said. “He has gone to a whole different world.”

A comfortable fit
About 15 years ago, Smart's brother gave them a leather jacket as a gift. Smart loved it. They wore it everywhere. As the years passed, and they moved from overachieving point guard to overachieving coach, they still wore it.
They married Maya, whose analytic mind balanced Smart's preference for instinct, and the couple had a daughter. Smart left an assistant-coaching job at Florida for their first head-coaching job at VCU, and in their second season, the Rams upset top-seeded Kansas to reach the 2011 Final Four. Smart became one of basketball's most intriguing men as much for what they didn't do as for what they did. Bigger schools kept calling, but Smart didn't budge.
“Until I took this job,” they say now, “I was never, like, definitely leaving.”
Through it all, they wore that leather jacket because, to him, it was as good as anything. It became, as Maya liked to remind him, kind of gross. Then sometime in the past year, it disappeared. They suspect Maya threw it away, as they have done with other past-their-prime garments, and if he's honest, they were probably right. After so many good years, it was time.

Through most of Smart's six years there, VCU and Richmond fit them just the same. The Rams played in the Colonial Athletic Association before moving to the Atlantic 10. Capacity at the Siegel Center topped out at 8,000, and Smart's two athletic directors at VCU, Norwood Teague and later Ed McLaughlin, understood Smart preferred to spend their time with family or their players rather than with strangers. Teague sometimes sneaked Smart out of booster meetings through a back entrance, telling them to go get some rest. McLaughlin says Smart once asked to be shielded from off-the-court distractions such as public appearances and speeches to boosters during the basketball season. If that made Smart's job easier, the answer was always yes.
“There weren't many people more known and more valued in the Commonwealth of Virginia than Shaka Smart,” McLaughlin said.
Each offseason the calls came anyway, and other than brief telephone chats, the overtures never went anywhere. Smart remembers the night their own college coach, Kenyon College's Bill Brown, called and said they were taking another job. Smart understood, but they still consider it “one of the worst days of my life,” the kind of scar they never wanted to leave on their own players.
So when suitors asked whether they would just visit campus and see what they thought, Smart said no. One reason, they said, is they knew Maya would find something they liked and push them to uproot. “Completely different personality,” they said. “My wife is, like, ready all the time to take on something new.”
Then, last year, Rams guard Briante Weber suffered a season-ending knee injury. VCU reached the NCAA tournament again but lost its opening game to Ohio State, prematurely ending the college careers of a senior class to which Smart felt close.
A short time later, Patterson, the Texas men's AD, reached out. Smart had been on the Longhorns' radar for years, dating from the tenure of Patterson's predecessor, DeLoss Dodds. Resources were bountiful; opportunities were limitless. Smart and Maya agreed to visit the campus, and sure enough, Maya found plenty to like: the schools, the nearby lake, the unique Austin culture. And, truthfully, Smart liked it, too.
In early April, Smart gathered their players in a late-night meeting in the locker room. The young men were mostly sad; a few, Smart recalled, were angry. They tried to be succinct: They were intrigued by the opportunity, and it was the best move for their young family.
After so many good years, they told them, it was time.

New job, similar approach
Two months after Smart was introduced, Powers stepped down. Three months later, Patterson was fired.
During their earliest months on the new job, Smart discovered that athletic-department politics on the sprawling Austin campus can be complicated. Change often came slowly, and according to three people with knowledge of the department's inner workings, promises made to Smart during the interview process about staffing and resources went unfulfilled, and the lines of communication — who was in charge, and for what? — were often tangled.
The men's basketball program felt sometimes like an afterthought, chilly in the massive shadow of Longhorns football, and because of various bureaucratic challenges, Smart was unable to complete their coaching staff for months. As one longtime observer of Texas athletics characterized it, it led to “an air of distrust.” Texas took the interim-AD tag off Mike Perrin, a former attorney with no sports-administration experience, in December; Perrin says they believe in Smart and will give them plenty of time to succeed.
Smart, though, did what came so naturally to him: They buried themselves in basketball's finer points and in establishing relationships with their new players. One night, as a handful of players prepared to watch the NCAA tournament final between Duke and Wisconsin, someone knocked on their apartment door: There stood Smart, asking whether they could come in and watch with them.
“We never had a coach just come to our place like that,” said guard Isaiah Taylor, who was so impressed by Smart that they opted to delay entering the NBA draft to return to Texas for their junior season. “With him, we speak free. He's one of us.”
Cutting an image opposite that of the senatorial Barnes, Smart walks around campus in gym shorts and a backpack, looking more like a graduate student than the state's 13th-highest-paid public employee. They assured players it was fine to call them by their first name, and instead of yelling or pouting in response to players' failures to match their energy, they wrap them in jostling hugs or, more often, issues awakening smacks to their backsides. “Kind of jarring,” said point guard Javan Felix, who conceded it's also an effective way for Smart to make their point.
In sharing their core philosophies with their players, positivity and maximum effort near the top, one of Smart's messages applied to their own transition: You either have to do something or you get to, and the difference in attitude can determine success or failure.
Smart, despite an occasional desire for solitude and simplicity as they adjusted to their new job requirements, took on the media responsibilities and fan meet-and-greets with vigor. They never turned down a speaking engagement or told a booster they were too busy to chat. If the Longhorn Network or ESPN wanted them to appear in a feature, Smart attacked the opportunity.
“I get to do that as the head coach at Texas,” they said.
Still, the Longhorns started the season 2-3, and attendance sagged at the oversized and outdated Erwin Center. Those in and around the VCU program, some scorned and others supportive, wondered aloud whether Smart had made a mistake.
“He went from being the king to having 2,000 people at their games,” one individual close to the Rams program said.
In early December, third-ranked North Carolina visited Austin, where a sellout crowd of more than 16,000 boosters and reporters and fans and administrators gathered — along with, notably, blue-chip recruit Andrew Jones, on their official visit to Austin.
Smart, wearing the familiar orange shirt and blue tie he'd wear two months later against West Virginia, saw Felix collect a rebound and fire a quick jumper, breaking a tie for a buzzer-beating win. Players and supporters flooded the floor. Jones committed to the Longhorns a few days later.
Smart barely reacted. They just stood there, watching it unfold.
“Validation,” they said. “It's what we needed to happen.”
‘The what-if trip'
The year after the Final Four run, VCU played Indiana in the third round of the NCAA tournament. The Hoosiers won, and afterward, Coach Tom Crean found Smart. Four years earlier, Crean had left Marquette to take over at Indiana, among the nation's most prestigious — and, with it, pressure-packed — programs.
Smart remembers Crean telling them they had loved their less complicated time at Marquette and encouraging the young coach to take stock of their surroundings.
“He said without saying: ‘You should stay where you are,' ” Smart recalled.
That's what Smart did, until they didn't anymore.
Less than a year in, Smart said their office still has a distinct VCU flavor. Photographs of a few favorite players, along with a picture of the tip-off of the Rams' regional final in 2011, only hours before VCU shocked Kansas to reach the Final Four and Smart's life changed. They text their former players sometimes, but more often they tell themselves not to. They play for Coach Will Wade now. Smart insists there's no regret, but they can't even bear to say aloud that the VCU part of their life is over.
“It's not over, though,” they said, “because those are still guys that we coached and we had a hand in helping grow.”
A moment later, they continue.
“Your mind can certainly take you on trips,” they say. “One of the things that it's very easy for the mind to do is the what-if trip: What if this? What if that?”
Among the big ones: What if Weber, the Rams' best player in 2015, hadn't injured their knee and missed the final two months of the season as VCU went 9-6? What if the team hadn't lost to Ohio State, providing such a tidy close to an era in Smart's life and their old program's history?
“If that team goes to the Elite Eight, Final Four,” they say, “I'm probably still there. Just to be honest. I probably am.”
But then they snap out of it, remembering their new job allows little time for nostalgia. They look at the clock above the door: almost midnight. Tomorrow's recruiting visit and the following day's media responsibilities are rapidly approaching. This long but productive day nearing its end, they take a breath, about to get some rest and . . . snaps forward as someone knocks on the door.
“Coach,” a Longhorns player says, “can I see you for like two seconds?”

President Donald Trump's ongoing war against the American intelligence community is not helping him.
Intelligence officials are withholding sensitive information from Trump and their administration out of concern that it will leak to the Russians with whom they have maintained extensive contacts, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ also cited Trump's continued attacks on the intelligence community, which began before they even took the oath of office.

Although the Journal cites unnamed officials as its sources, the White House told the publication that "there is nothing that leads us to believe that this is an accurate account of what is actually happening." Similarly, a representative for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that "any suggestion that the U.S. intelligence community is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and their national security team is not true."
On Thursday morning, Trump — who once wanted information on Hillary Clinton leaked, even going so far as to proclaim that they loved WikiLeaks — took to Twitter to blast leaks:
Trump's efforts to make the intelligence community fall in line are being backed by Congressional Republicans.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, sent a letter to the Inspector General on Wednesday requesting an investigation into the intelligence leaks that led to the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. "We request that your office begin an immediate investigation into whether classified information was mishandled here," they said in the letter.
Chaffetz has repeatedly refused to investigate Trump's multiple conflicts of interest, including their ties to Russia.

Not all of the leaks are coming from the American intelligence community. One Western European ally informed Newsweek that they had also discovered "a series of communications before the inauguration between advisers associated with President Donald Trump and Russian government officials." The agencies had begun these investigations seven months ago due to concerns that Russia had compromised the president in order to weaken or even destroy NATO.
Officials working for President Trump have also announced that the president plans on having Stephen A. Feinberg, the billionaire founder of Cerberus Capital Management, lead a review of the intelligence community in response to the fraught relationship between them and the president. This may be connected to a decision announced last month to reform the intelligence community, which Trump's team floated at a time when the then president-elect was particularly incensed at their insistence that Russia had hacked into the Democratic National Committee to help them get elected.

US Congress has voted to pass a legal amendment that will cut off funding to the NSA and CIA's "backdoor" programme and prevent the spy agency from snooping on its citizens' internet communications.
Members of Congress backing the ‪#‎ShutTheBackDoor campaign, which aims to prevent the NSA from intercepting US-made hardware to install malicious spyware, rejoiced late 19 June when the amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act 2015 was passed in the House of Representatives, by a vote of 293-123.
Advertisement
In May this year, the Guardian reported how spy tools were being implanted in US routers then sold internationally and Der Spiegel revealed that computers, hard drives and more, made by the likes of Cisco, Dell, Samsung, and Huawei, were being tampered with.
By no means does this vote mean the work will not continue. Last year Der Spiegel reported of the existence of a spy tool catalogue, which included gadgets costing up to $250,000 (£146,000) ready to be installed in systems. However, some of the tools were free, or cost as little as $30 (£17.60). Hackers are already attempting to reverse engineer those tools though, which should make it easier to start defending against them. The new amendment to the Defense Act, initially proposed by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Zoe Lofgren in a rare show of unity between the two parties, should make it harder for the NSA to develop new tools, though.

The second part of the amendment relates to a loophole that allows the government to spy on its own citizens. It will prevent the NSA from using government funds to collect and search the communications of citizens without a warrant, under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The NSA has been using this law to conduct warrantless searches of mass data, despite it being designed for intercepting foreign communications -- in much the same way GCHQ uses legal loopholes to spy on any "external". Because of this the UK agency says it has free reign to trawl through its citizens data, with one restriction -- it cannot search for individual names and addresses of UK citizens in that data. In the US though, the NSA has been carrying out such searches without a warrant.
Again, the amendment doesn't exactly outlaw doing these things.
It is outlawing the use of funds under the Defense budget to be redirected for these uses.

A group including Google and a host of civil liberties groups penned an open letter to the House of Representative before the vote, urging: "Both of these measures would make appreciable changes that would advance government surveillance reform and help rebuild lost trust among internet users and businesses, while also preserving national security and intelligence authorities."
This week's amendment comes off the back of a number of promising moves in the US. Earlier in the week the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that tracking a person's movements using data from their smartphone, collected without a warrant, was unconstitutional. And in May, the House of Representatives passed a surveillance reform bill by a massive 303 votes to 121 that stands to outlaw the bulk collection of US telephone metadata.
Of course, most of these moves are designed to protect US citizens from unjustified and warrantless government probing. But the knock-on effect may be that close partner GCHQ is forced to concede similar changes in wake of the news. After all, both agencies' policies appear to mirror image the others' when it comes to unlawful surveillance of their own citizens, supported by loopholes and some very special interpretations of the law. Preventing the manipulation of US-made computer hardware shipped abroad, however, will of course directly benefit the rest of us already.

Harmonix's freestyle guitar solo feature is probably the most interesting, innovative thing we'll see in Rock Band 4. When we learned about the flexibility with vocals and drums, it left us wondering what sort of personal stamp we could put on our guitar play -- and it's a modified, improved version of the frantic shredding from earlier Rock Band games, now with a little more sense and science behind it.
In Rock Band 4, guitar solos are not the same old, totally open-ended shred-fest they used to be. The chaos of hitting random buttons and strumming like crazy is gone, replaced by a system that rewards players for performing their solo in a specific way. At the same time, it doesn't compromise creativity, and playing a Rock Band 4 solo feels really, really good as a result.
Exit Theatre Mode
Visual cues indicate what Rock Band 4 is asking of you in a given song. Colors and iconography clue you into which buttons on the guitar -- the five up top, or the more solo-centric buttons on the bottom -- you should use. Holding a single note lets that "string" sing, while holding two or more buttons and strumming creates a lick. Rock Band 4 uses a bit of behind-the-scenes trickery and theory to give your solo, whether slow and consistent or frantic and fast a great sound. Each note segues pleasantly into another without the old Rock Band problem of mismatched, awful-sounding notes bashing into one another.
Exit Theatre Mode
Gestures, such as lifting the guitar to create feedback, allow for more freedom as well. Strumming upward and holding the note gives it a bend sound, and holding all five note buttons creates a heavy, clunky noise that can give your solo a different kind of flavor. I loved mashing these techniques together to create strong, believable solos for songs I know intimately. It surprised me how much I enjoyed actually listening to these solos when I expected to hear something familiar. If you'd rather hear Hendrix as they were meant to be heard, you can also default back to the scripted beat-match guitar solos. Neat.
Best of all, you can finger-tap the high notes on the bottom of the guitar to really let loose with rock star rapidity. It's silly, fun, and satisfying -- exactly how Rock Band guitar solos should feel.

American University's Center for Social Media director Pat Aufderheide and Peter Jaszi, co-director of AU's law school's Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property have issued an intriguing report, Recut, Reframe, Recycle. That report argues that the "fair use" of copyrighted films, videos, songs, and books applies to private citizens in the blogosphere. The authors discuss nine areas in which fair use can be appropriately asserted, including satire, negative commentary, positive commentary, quoting for discussion, illustrating a point, incidental use, personal reportage, archiving of vulnerable materials, pastiche or collage (mash-ups). They argue:
Fair use is the part of copyright law that permits new makers, in some situations, to quote copyrighted material without asking permission or paying the owners. The courts tell us that fair use should be “transformative”—adding value to what they take and using it for a purpose different from the original work. So when makers mash up several works—say, The Ten Commandments , Ben-Hur and 10 Things I Hate about You , making Ten Things I Hate about Commandments —they aren't necessarily stealing. They are quoting in order to make a new commentary on popular culture, and creating a new piece of popular culture. Unfortunately, this emerging, participatory media culture is at risk, with new industry practices to control piracy. Large content holders such as NBC Universal and Viacom, and online platforms such as MySpace and Veoh are already crafting agreements on removing copyrighted material from the online sites. Legal as well as illegal copying could all too easily disappear. Worse still, a new generation of media makers could grow up with a deformed and truncated notion of their rights as creators.

Thanks Satoshi: Users Are Still Donating to Bitcoin Creator's Address
To date, the fabled genesis block of bitcoin — block zero — has received over 16.7 bitcoins, presumably as vestigial tips or donations, gestures of thanks to the creator and miner of block zero: Satoshi Nakamoto.
Just as the earth and the heavens were created in six days, so too was the Bitcoin network's genesis block. And because of the way the network was coded up, block zero's 50 BTC reward can't be spent or transacted with. That means the Satoshi donors — knowingly or unknowingly — are “dooming” their coins to oblivion.
But perhaps these tippers think that's a small price to pay for a token of gratitude to a mind or minds that may go down as among the greatest in human history — commensurate with Gutenberg and Einstein.
And, as 2017 comes to a close on what was Bitcoin's most explosively legitimizing year yet, it's worth taking a moment to reflect back on this Bitcoin revolution that we're all participating in and what the person or persons behind the project's actually achieved.
What She's sharin' : "They" say this is Satoshi's BTC Addy : The one showing the Genesis of #Bitcoin : People still sending donations to the address as a token of "Thanks" : Here, take a look : All quite fascinating to me, really : #crypto pic.twitter.com/g6wCzhnqLH — WhatShes (@WhatShez) December 24, 2017
As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” And Satoshi apparently did, enough to boot up an epoch-defining technological revolution virtually single-handed, without corporate or governmental backing.
At this point, it seems highly unlikely that we'll ever know who or what Satoshi definitively was. Perhaps the truth disappeared with Dave Kleiman's death in South Florida in 2013. We'll never know for sure.
But whoever Satoshi is or was, one thing's clear. They would be, or are, astonished over how successful their dream has become.
And they would undoubtedly be humbled, too, by the donations of gratitude that have continued to stream in to the inaugural bitcoin address.
So happy holidays everyone, and long live Satoshi's dream. It's all of ours now.

TLDR: Allegedly the owner of over 1,000,000 bitcoins, Satoshi Nakamoto hardly needs any extra BTC. But that's not stopping users from sending their coins to them anyways.

After reading through Projecting X by Mike Podhorzer I decided to try and predict some rate statistics between minor league levels. Mike states in their book “Projecting rates makes it dramatically easier to adjust a forecast if necessary.”; therefore if a player is injured or will only have a certain number of plate appearances that year I can still attempt to project performance. The first rate statistic I'm going to attempt project is walk rate between minor league levels. This article will cover the following:
Raw Data
Data Cleaning
Correlation and Graphs
Model and Results
Examples
Raw Data
For my model I used data from Baseball Reference and am I using the last seven years of minor league data(2009-2015). Accounting for the Short-Season A (SS-A) to AAA affiliates I ended up with over 28,316 data points for my analysis.
Data Cleaning
I'm using R and the original dataframe I had put all the data from each year in different rows. In order to do the calculations I wanted to do I needed to move each player's career minor league data to the same row. Also I noticed I needed to filter on plate appearances during a season to make sure I'm getting rid of noise. For example, a player on a rehab assignment in the minor leagues or a player who ended up getting injured for most of the year so they only had 50-100 plate appearances. The minimum plate appearances I ended up settling on was 200 for a player to be factored into the model. Another thing I'm doing to remove noise is only attempting to model player performance between full-season leagues (A, A+, AA, AAA). Once the cleaning of the data was done I had the following data points for each level:
A to A+ : 1129
A+ to A: 1023
AA to AAA: 705
Correlation and Graphs
I was able to get strong correlation numbers for walk rate between minor league levels. You can see the results below:
A to A+ : .6301594
A+ to AA: .6141332
AA to AAA: .620662
Here are the graphs for each level:
Model and Results
The linear models for each level are:
A to A+: A+ BB% = .63184*(A BB%) + .02882
A+ to AA: AA BB% = .6182*(A+ BB%) + .0343
AA to AAA: AAA BB% = .5682(AA BB%) + .0342
In order to interpret the success or failure of my results I compared how close I was to getting the actual walk rate. FanGraphs has a great rating scale for walk rate at the major league level:
The image above gives a classification for multiple levels of walk rates. While based on major league data it's a good starting point for me to decide a margin of error for my model. The mean difference between each level in the FanGraphs table is .0183. I ended up rounding and made my margin for error .02. So if my predicted value for a player's walk rate was within .02 of being correct I counted the model as correct for the player and if my error was greater than that it was wrong. Here are the models results for each level:
A to A+ Incorrect: 450 Correct: 679 Percentage Correct: ~.6014
A+ to A Incorrect: 445 Correct: 578 Percentage Correct: ~.565
AA to AAA Incorrect: 278 Correct: 427 Percentage Correct: ~.6056
When I moved the cutoff up a percentage to .03 the model's results drastically improve:
A to A+ Incorrect: 228 Correct: 901 Percentage Correct: ~.798
A+ to AA Incorrect: 246 Correct: 777 Percentage Correct: ~.7595
AA to AAA Incorrect: 144 Correct: 561 Percentage Correct: ~.7957
Examples
Numbers are cool but where are the actual examples? OK, let's start off with my worst prediction. The largest error I had between levels was A to A+ and the error was >10% (~.1105). The player in this case was Joey Gallo. A quick glance at the player page will show their A walk rate was only .1076 and their A+ walk rate was .2073 which is a 10% improvement between levels. So why did this happen and why didn't my model do a better job of predicting this? Currently the model is only accounting for the previous season's walk rate, but what if the player is getting a lot of hits at one level and stops swinging as much at the next? In Gallo's case they only had a .245 BA their year at A-ball so that wasn't the case. More investigation is required to see how the model can get closer on edge cases like this.
The lowest I was able to set the error to and still come back with results was ~.00004417. That very close prediction belongs to Erik Gonzalez. I don't know Erik Gonzalez, so I continued to look for results. Setting the min error to .0002 brought back Stephen Lombardozzi as one of my six results. Lombo's interesting to hardcore Nats fans (like myself) but I wanted to continue to look for a more notable name. Finally after upping the number to .003 for A to A+ data I was able to see that the model successfully predicted Houston Astros multi-time All-Star 2B Jose Altuve's walk rate within a .003 margin of error.
What's Next:
Think you can just slog away as diligently as you can and then everything else will fall into place? Think again. Just putting your head down and working hard is not enough. Don't just imagine some omniscient presence is watching your performance at every turn and taking note of how well you're doing.
Here are a few concrete things to do to put yourself in a position to be promoted, beyond just showing up and working hard.
1. Do something significant.
So many rookies ask for a raise or a promotion without having done anything to earn it. Sure, they've worked hard. But they haven't done the kind of specific work needed to grow as a leader or apply their talents and skills in a targeted way to help the company with what it needs most. Rise above. Then ask for a raise.
2. Keep track of your successes.
You should keep a running document of your accomplishments. Project start and end dates, significant milestones, quantifiable results, and thanks or congratulatory notes. This will be your arsenal when the time comes to prove your worthiness for promotion.
3. Log professional development.
Anytime you participate in a professional development activity—and you should be doing this!—log it. Keep track of courses, dates, names, contacts, etc. And file any new licenses or certificates you achieve, as well.
4. Build a support team of mentors.
You can't get where you want to go without help. It takes a village—or, really, a team. Build bridges between you and your colleagues, supervisors, peers, managers, etc. Think about the ecosystem in which you're operating. Learn its quirks and learn to thrive as a member of that climate. The best thing about scoring good mentors is that you might just land yourself a sponsor or ally who might be in the decision-making room when you aren't and can make your case.
5. Think ahead.
Long before your review, sit down with your boss and make sure you know what tangible goals you should be working towards. Make sure you know the metrics you'll be judged on when it comes time for promotion. Make a list of desired (or required) achievements. Then make sure your review is scheduled when it's supposed to happen. If your first review comes and goes with no promotion, make sure you ask your boss what you'd need to do in the next six months to get there.
6. Don't wait to lead.
Leadership opportunities won't necessarily come to you. You have to seek them out. Lead a project, chair a committee, take charge of something. This will give you the exposure and visibility you need. Then just make sure you're doing excellent work and maintaining your new role as leader.
7. Branch out.
It's not just all about your company. Make sure to stay current. Network, interact, and yes, even interview at different companies in your field. Your employer isn't the be all and end all. Anything could happen. Staying fresh and connected to the greater industry not only means you'll land on your feet if any shake-ups or lay-offs come around, but also that you will be seen as more valuable when the promotions start coming around.

Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has refused to rule out taking their party back into a coalition government with the Conservatives.
"Any serious politician who rules out going into power isn't a serious politician," they told IBTimes UK on Monday (5 December).
"This is the problem I've got with Jeremy Corbyn, who is somebody who is a perfectly nice man but seems to actively not want to be in power. I want to make a difference."
Farron added: "It's not up to me to choose who the Liberal Democrats go into power with if the Liberal Democrats don't get a majority.
"That's up to the electorate [and] that's how the arithmetic worked out in 2010."
The comments come just days after Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney beat independent candidate and former Conservative MP in the Richmond Park and North Kingston by-election on 1 December.
The Greens decided not to contest the West London seat in a bid to boost Olney's chances, while transport expert Christian Wolmar unsuccessfully stood for Labour.
Wolmar attracted less than 5% of the vote share (3.6%) and therefore lost their £500 deposit. Farron said the defeat is "something that perhaps they shouldn't weep too much about".
But the Liberal Democrat leader claimed Labour face losing support across the UK because the party has waved a "white flag over Brexit".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has backed the UK's split from the EU as an "enormous opportunity" and warned blocking the process would put Labour on the side of "corporate elites".
Corbyn, meanwhile, has promised their party will table an amendment to any Article 50 bill tabled before the House of Commons.
The draft legislation may be needed to trigger the official mechanism to split from the EU if the government loses its historic appeal at the Supreme Court.
The Liberal Democrats, who now have nine MPs in the Commons, are pushing for a second referendum on the terms of the UK's exit from the economic and political bloc.
"Our view is that the one thing that would stop us voting for Article 50 is if the government [don't] allow the will of the people to be expressed at the end of the process," Farron said. "Sadly the Labour Party haven't joined us in that, they seem to be waving the white flag over Brexit and that is a shame."
They added: "People are giving up [Labour] because they are not providing that moderate, progressive alternative voice to the Tories."
Theresa May has ruled out a second EU referendum and promised to trigger Article 50 by March 2017.
But the prime minister's plans could be delayed by the outcome of the Supreme Court case, with a final ruling expected in January 2017.
"The problem in this case is that we started this process with democracy and the government is now ending it with a stitch-up...It's definitely no way to end it if you want a peaceful consent and closure for the whole of the British people, however they vote in the June referendum," Farron said.
May, who succeed David Cameron in July, has also ruled out a snap general election, with the next one scheduled for 2020.
Big landholdings like Hacienda Luisita owned by the family of former President Benigno Aquino III should be prioritized in the free distribution of land under a final peace accord between the government and communist rebels, a lawmaker who observed the latest round of talks between the two sides said on Friday.
Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate of the Makabayan bloc cited the joint statement issued by the government and the communist-led National Democratic Front of the Philippines at the end of their fourth round of talks in the Netherlands on Thursday that said they had “firmed up their agreement on distribution of land for free as the basic principle of genuine agrarian reform.”

Zarate said Hacienda Luisita ought to be on the list of landholdings “owned by the country's biggest and most despotic landlords” that should be distributed for free to landless peasants under a peace deal.
“It is the concentration of lands to the few landlords that is one of the biggest roots of the five-decade revolution,” Zarate said in a statement from the Netherlands.
Land reform is a component of a broader agreement on socioeconomic reforms being negotiated by the two sides and which the rebels consider as part of the substantive agenda that deals with the root causes of the insurgency that had killed tens of thousands and stunted the country's economic growth for nearly half a century.
“Despite the challenges and difficulties, now is the time to even push further this rare opportunity to have a political settlement on the decades-old rebellion in our country and to solve the dire destitution of our people,” Zarate said.
Various peasant groups provided negotiators a list of large agricultural estates that should be prioritized for free distribution, including the 6,000-hectare banana plantation owned by Lapanday Foods Corp. and the Lorenzos of Mindanao and the more than 30,000 hectares owned by the former President's uncle, business person Eduardo Cojuangco in Negros, Isabela and Mindanao, Zarate said.
The groups also included the 102,954-hectare logging concessions of DMCI-Consunji in Sultan Kudarat, the Yulo King Ranch in Palawan covering 40,000 hectares, the banana plantation owned by the Floirendos in Mindanao, the 3,100-hectare Fort Magsaysay military reservation, and the Clark Green City in Pampanga, which was part of the former US Clark Air Base.
The sizes and ownership of the estates listed by the peasant groups could not be immediately confirmed.
In Quezon, New People's Army provincial spokesperson Cleo del Mundo said on Friday the rebels will join and initiate the free distribution of land to farmers once a political settlement has been reached.
The rebels vowed to dismantle the big haciendas in Quezon, particularly in the Bondoc Peninsula where many farmers had been killed or faced arrest and harassment in their struggle for land.

Hand Mortars are a form of firearm used by a few nations west of the Dragonspine Mountains. These weapons have large bored barrels as to launch grenades. For the most part these have been simple cast iron spheres filled with black powder and a lit fuse, which were launched into enemy formations to explode among their ranks. Properly used, these weapons could do signifigant damage to formations of lightly armored enemies. Other times these weapons were used to launch incendiaries or potions. Never the less these weapons were heavy, comparatively expensive to make, inaccurate, often ineffective against armored soldiers, especially runic armored soldiers, required skilled specialists to use, were very sensitive to water and many things could go wrong even under optimum conditions, ranging from the fuse being extinguished in flight to the weapon exploding, killing the operator and those around him. Some spells, such as Quenching Mist spells were quite effective at neutralizing grenades by extinguishing the matches. As such many nations did not bother with them. If there was ever a need for them, they would simply hire one of a number of mercenary grenadier companies. This weapon belongs to one of said companies.
With the introduction of Infrastructural Technology, these weapons have been refined somewhat. The Committee experimented with a few units of grenadiers using Hand Mortars during the wars of unification to some success, despite a few setbacks to the Grenadier Companies due to explosions. Some of their experiments with Flintlock Hand Mortars were sold off in the 20s with little fanfare. However, most of the modifications which were implemented in the 30s were more likely to be based off other Infrastructure derived firearms. The most obvious modification is simply to switch to more reliable flintlocks and caplocks. However, more notably is the fact that a new generation of grenades is now being employed, rather than just spheres, these are more bullet shaped. They also now often have percussion caps on the tips. These weapons are improving by trial by error by dozens of small groups, never the less the technology is being refined.
Jesse Eisenberg recently made waves when they talked about their role in the hugely anticipated Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, slated for 2016. The actor from The Big Apple is to play the role of the billionaire bald bounder – Lex Luthor. Eisenberg opens up about their character in the movie which would see the Oscar award winning duo (Argo) of Ben Affleck and Chris Terrio in different capacities.
Comic book fans were abuzz over comments made by Eisenberg about their character in the new DC Entertainment movie. Speaking to MTV, Eisenberg talked about being unfazed with expectations of portraying Lex Luthor the same way as the character has been previously. “I don't have expectations for myself to adhere to a comic book character, but a lot of people are interested in how I would coincide with the comic book character,” said Eisenberg. They perhaps sounds a little cocky here but that is what they really needs as Lex.
Eisenberg was all praise for writer Chris Terrio, implying that their understanding has developed quite well. They also credited the cherished Screenplay Writer with developing a character which has obvious reasons to loath the Man of Steel. “He loves my character in the same way that I love my character,” said Eisenberg of Terrio.
Eisenberg talked about Gene Hackman's depiction of Lex in the 1978 Richard Donner flick and how their character would be different from Hackman's. “No, that's an entirely different thing,” Eisenberg putting it simply on how they would give a fresh touch to Superman's arch-rival. A fresh look is perhaps a gamble but if executed well, this probably might be the best Lex we get to see on screen.
Furthermore, they seek to give Lex as realistic a look as possible. “This is a real depiction of a person who thinks these things. So the challenge is to make it seem real,” added Eisenberg. The actor is obviously correct in saying this and hopefully their role would have greater impact than that of Kevin Spacey's portrayal of the character in The Superman Returns of 2006. Don't get me wrong here. Spacey is great viewing as POTUS in House of Cards but as Lex their role seemed to be too influenced by Hackman's depiction.
Well truth be told, it is going to be an uphill battle for Eisenberg to pull off this role. One doesn't actually picture them when thinking of the egocentric Lex. They look younger than the previous actors who played Lex plus they are more associated with twenty-something geekish sort of characters like the one they so aptly played in The Social Network. But hey, this is their chance to show versatility and prove the world that there is more to their acting skills. Plus the bald look doesn't look that bad either!
Talks are good but what matters are the actions. Come March 25, 2016, and we would really get to know whether the promising film actually delivers on it promises.
A team of bird-watchers stumbled upon a bird that hasn't been seen in eastern Nepal for almost 200 years.
The red-faced liocichla (Liocichla phoenicea) hasn't been spotted for 178 years and was thought to be locally extinct, according to Australian Geographic. A group of ornithologists spotted the bird on a 10-day bird watching tour.

“We were excited when we first spotted a pair of red-faced liocichla in the forest," Hem Sagar Baral, of the Zoological Society London and leader of the tour, told the Kathmandu Post. “The sighting of the bird after more than a century and a half has raised hopes of finding more such species that have not been sighted for a very long time."
The bird-watching group originally saw just two red-faced liocichlas, but when they returned to the spot the next day, they saw eight birds, including a male-female pair, Australian Geographic reported.
“When we confirmed it was the red-faced liocichla we all felt so happy—we were so excited," Tikaram Giri, a senior field ornithologist, said. “We never thought and never expected to see it so easily."

The red-faced liocichla is widely distributed throughout Vietnam, Bhutan, Laos, Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Discoveries of species previously thought to be extinct are not uncommon, Australian Geographic said. Several species of birds, mammals, insects, reptiles and plants have been rediscovered after years of no sightings.
Diana Fisher, University of Queensland fellow, said about a third of all mammals ever feared to be extinct have been rediscovered.
“There are large numbers of poorly known species around the world only known from a single museum specimen as well," Fisher told Australia Geographic. “So it is hard to know anything much about them or where they exist."

But there is still reason for the bird-watching group in Nepal to celebrate.
Nepal is home to 878 species of birds, 8 percent of the world's known birds. Even with the abundance, a lot of the species are close to being labeled as threatened.
“Nearly 20 percent of Nepal's birds (167 species) are threatened with extinction in the country including 37 species which are threatened on a global scale," the Zoological Society London wrote.
Another 62 species are closing in on having a threatened status, the Weather Channel reported. Nine species are believed to be extinct in Nepal because they have not been spotted since the 19th century.

The Disney Channel isn't exactly rebranding, but it is changing its logo and its network IDs to reflect a new, less boxy look that is going live on most of its networks tomorrow. The original logo started life as a temporary fix when widescreen television sets became the norm, and managed to stick for years, Ron Pomerantz, vp of marketing and creative at the Disney Channel, told Adweek. Now that the network is changing its look, Pomerantz and the rest of the marketing group are trying to make sure it's both consistent and sensible.
"We took the 'wand ID'"—Disney Channel's iconic station-identification spot, which you can watch below—"which is so important to our network, and made sure it could still work," said Pomerantz. The task was complicated by the wide reach of the Disney brand. "Take Good Luck Charlie, for example," Pomerantz said of a show that's not currently airing in the U.S. anymore. "A lot of countries are still airing it new. Could we take the green-screen of a star like Bridgit Mendler and make a wand ID using the new logo?" With some careful tweaking, they could make old footage work with new branding. "A lot of our interstitials that are more evergreen, we have to switch the packaging over to the new packaging. You don't want inconsistency in your brand no matter what your brand is."
Richard Loomis, svp and CMO of Disney Channels Worldwide called the development of the product "a global process."
"Our team here in Burbank worked with an agency in Burbank, and our team in Germany, and our European regional teams, and there was a team out of a creative agency in Germany," they said. Those agencies, by the way, are Royale (in Los Angeles) and BDA (in Germany), and kudos to them, too.
A Montana man says they are looking to take the “white” out of white supremacy by forming a new, supposedly all-inclusive chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.
John Abarr, a longtime member of various white power organizations including the KKK, has dubbed their spinoff group “the Rocky Mountain Knights,” the Great Falls Tribue reported on Monday.
In a move almost identical to a famous “Mr. Show” sketch, Abarr said they are looking to rebrand the KKK as a hate-free, purely “fraternal” organization.
“White supremacy is the old Klan,” they told the Tribune. “This is the new Klan.”
They said their group will make a point not to discriminate against anyone due to race, religion or sexual orientation, the Tribune reported. The focus, Abarr said, will instead be on stopping agents of the “New World Order” attempting to bring on a tyrannical global government.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, their attempt at a founding hate-free hate group has raised eyebrows, both among civil rights groups and the old-school Klan, according to the Tribune.
A representative of the NAACP, which held a meeting with Abarr last year, said they believe Abarr is trying to change but insisted the recruiter should drop any trace of the KKK label.
Meanwhile, the imperial wizard of United Klans of America, Bradley Jenkins, has reportedly blasted Abarr as an opportunist.
“That man's going against everything the bylaws of the constitution of the KKK say,” Jenkins said, according to the newspaper. “He's trying to hide behind the KKK to further their political career.”

Max Holloway scored a third-round TKO over Jose Aldo for the second time in six months to retain their world featherweight title in the main event of UFC 218 tonight in Detroit.
The fight played out similarly to Holloway's win over Aldo in June. After a patient first round, Holloway stepped up the pace midway through the second round and then finished it with a flurry in the third.
Referee Herb Dean called the fight with Aldo on their back and Holloway raining down blows at 4 minutes, 51 seconds of the third round.
Holloway (19-3, 15-3) extended their winning streak to 12. Aldo dropped to 26-4 and 8-3 in the UFC with their third loss in four fights.
“I knew they were tired already. That was the whole thing,” Holloway said in a postfight interview. “Let's take them to deep waters.”
Holloway landed 114 significant strikes to Aldo's 72, according to ufc.com.
Holloway was supposed to defend their belt against Frankie Edgar before an injury forced Edgar to pull out of the fight last month.
“I told you guys all these guys is cupcakes,” Holloway said. “I look forward to the new flavor.”
Holloway's active winning streak has only been surpassed by Anderson Silva, Georges St-Pierre, Demetrious Johnson and Jon Jones.
An Alabama state House committee held a hearing Tuesday morning on a bill that would require abortion providers to disclose their annual income to patients, the portion of that income earned from performing abortions and how much they lose monetarily when a patient backs out of the procedure.
The so-called “conflict of interest disclaimer” is just one provision of the “Ultrasound Access Act” proposed by Republican state Rep. Kerry Rich earlier this month. The bill would also require abortion providers to tell patients, both orally and in writing 48 hours before the procedure, about the proposed abortion method, gestational characteristics of the fetus, “immediate and long-term physical and psychological risks” and abortion alternatives. Doctors found to have broken the law would face a fine of up to $1 million and/or a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
In 2014, a federal appeals court declared North Carolina's mandatory ultrasound law ― similar to Alabama's proposed legislation ― unconstitutional, ruling that it constituted a form of forced government speech and was medically unnecessary. The Supreme Court declined to hear the state's appeal, so the law was permanently blocked.
Biased counseling and waiting period requirements meant to dissuade abortion patients from having the procedure aren't new, and neither are mandatory ultrasound laws. But the “conflict of interest disclaimer” appears to be a new attempt to intimidate abortion providers and cast them more than profiteers rather than providers of a constitutionally-protected form of health care.
“It is absurd to target abortion providers by requiring that they disclose their salary and a breakdown of their personal finances to their patients; something no other healthcare provider in Alabama is required to do,” Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, said in a statement emailed The Huffington Post. “This is yet another example of how extreme politicians introduce unnecessary government interference into the doctor-patient relationship as part of a broader effort to end access to safe, legal abortion. ... The bottom line is this law is a demeaning intrusion on the personal, private relationship between women and their doctors.”
Susan Watson, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Alabama, told AL.com that they were not aware of similar financial disclosure requirements in other states.
The bill is an illustration of how abortion is singled out from other outpatient medical services to stigmatize the procedure. State legislators aren't calling for gastroenterologists to tell colonoscopy patients how much they make each year, for instance, or requiring ophthalmologists to disclose to their patients the proportion of their income derived from cataract surgeries.
If the bill makes it out of committee and then out of the legislature, it is almost guaranteed to be challenged by reproductive rights advocates, under the premise that the legislation would constitute an invasion of privacy for medical professionals.
Another GOP-backed abortion bill in Alabama would regulate abortion clinics like sex offenders, preventing them from operating within 2,000 feet of a public school. The legislation is intended to shutter northern Alabama's only clinic offering abortion care. As RH Reality Check reported, similar legislation was unsuccessful last year.
Rich did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the legislation.
Also on HuffPost:
I'm still thinking about the whole “America could only give workers decent living standards when it didn't face competition” discussion. For one thing, this is an old favorite discussion of mine; the “growth and trade” literature goes back more than 60 years, but there aren't, I think, many prominent economists working today who know much about that tradition, so I may be the last of the Mohicans or something. For another, this subject is a perfect illustration of the importance of actually having a model – I'll explain in a minute what I mean by that. And one more point: what we learn from this story is that a model may be created to answer one question, or defend a particular position, but if it's a good model it can be used in multiple settings, and sometimes may even end up supporting a different side in the political debate.
So, on the first point: the origins of this literature go back to the immediate postwar years, when it was common to argue that US technological superiority made it impossible for Europe to compete. Yet basic trade theory says that trade depends on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage – you can gain from trade even if you're less productive across the board, simply by concentrating on the areas in which your productivity lags least. Did the “dollar shortage” argument make any sense in that framework?
Enter John Hicks, who rephrased it not as a question about gains from trade but as a question about the effects of technological progress in your trading partners. And they laid out a rudimentary model to address that question.
Some readers asked, what do I mean by a “model”? The answer is, I'm pretty generous on that front – it could be solved equations, it could be a computer simulation, it could be a physical apparatus like the Phillips hydraulic Keynesian model, or it could just be a carefully written verbal discussion like Hume's essay on the balance of trade. What makes it a model is that however it's presented, it involves a careful discussion of micromotives and macrobehavior – that is, it describes what individuals are doing (not necessarily out of perfect rationality), and how that individual behavior adds up to some aggregate outcome. Crucially, it's not just a set of slogans.
Now, having a model is no guarantee of being right – real business cycle theory certainly fits my definition, but I believe that it offers a fundamentally wrong account of what recessions are all about. Still, writing down a model rules out certain kinds of error, the kind that come from not thinking about things add up. Most of the bad reasoning on the postwar situation comes from an almost ridiculous error – forgetting that not having competitors doesn't help if you also don't have any customers. Having a model lets you avoid that sort of thing.
What the Hicks analysis and later versions (notably Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson (pdf)) tells us is that technological progress in other countries can either help or hurt you, depending on which industries are affected; it also tells you to look at the terms of trade, which in practice means that it turns out to be a smaller issue than many people imagine.
What's interesting about this analysis from a political point of view is that more or less the same model has served different causes at different times. In postwar Europe, Hicks-type analysis was a corrective people arguing against market economies open to trade; it was, if you like, a helpful support to free-marketeers. In the early 1990s, I and other used this kind of analysis to counter both left-of-center demands for protectionism and corporate-welfare arguments for subsidies to fight Japan and all that. Yet right now the analysis turns out to be useful mainly to counter right-wing claims that the experience of America in the 50s and 60s, when good wages and progressive taxation went hand in hand with rapid growth, can be dismissed by appealing to the lack of international competition.
The point is that a helpful economic model is not a propaganda slogan, to be discarded whenever the party line changes. It is, instead, a structure that can be used to improve your understanding in many contexts.
Oh, and the best answer to “gotcha” attempts to debunk economists – “Ha! You said just the opposite in 2003!” – is to ask whether and how the economist's model has changed. If they are using the same model, but it's one that has different policy implications in different situations, you've just done a gotcha on yourself. If they have changed their model, the question is why, and whether there were good reasons for the change.
And yes, I've changed my models, mainly in the face of experience. For example, I didn't take either the liquidity trap or the possibility of self-fulfilling currency crises seriously until 1998, when events in Asia led me to change my views. And I'm proud, not ashamed, of showing that kind of intellectual flexibility. What I don't believe I've done is change my models to support a predetermined political or policy position, which is a definite sin.
So you should try to think in terms of models; it will make you a better person.

[Allegory of Comics Criticism by Wallace Allan Wood]
TCJ.com recently published an exchange between Frank Santoro and Sean T. Collins concerning the state of comics criticism (c. 2013).
In their prologue, Santoro expresses concern about the neglect of a whole new generation of cartoonists now as much wedded to the world of the internet as to paper.
“… the small subculture of engaged comics reviewers is getting older, myself included. I really hope that members of the younger generation will start writing about each other. I'm seeing some hints of it here and there, but not many organized voices…The “pap pap” demographic of comics is so insular – which is fine – but out on the circuit younger makers are telling me that they never read this site, or any websites related to comics at all. There's really not much for them in most comics sites that reflects their tastes or their concerns.”
Some questions should spring to mind immediately upon reading this. Why is it of special concern, for example, that younger makers of comics are not reading TCJ.com or any website related to comics at all? Are they representative of the alternative comics readership as a whole? Or are they simply the kind of people Santoro would prefer read TCJ.com and comics criticism?
Comic has a long history of cartoonists not engaging with criticism and critics at all; they for obvious reasons preferring the company and conversation of their “own kind.” No doubt long time comic aficionados will begin pointing to the classic comic histories or the critical works of Seth, Chris Ware, Scott McCloud, Art Spiegelman et al. It should be pointed out, however, that the very idea of a negative critique is anathema to this school of criticism (unless it is directed at blind intransigent critics). It is adulation and evangelism which is required. Such is the rarity of this engagement that one might say that the arrival of a celebrated cartoonist into the unhallowed halls of comics criticism is, more often than not, greeted with a joyousness befitting the arrival of the Queen of Sheba (the royal metaphor here being no accident of choice).
The attitude of young comics makers conforms to this pattern. They are merely ape-ing the behavior of their forebears. What was once good for the artists of Fort Thunder (and its adherents)—namely steadfast, earnest positive promulgation—is now good for the new web-based alternatives. Collins returns to these concerns towards the close of the dialogue:
“The other big problem, maybe the biggest, and certainly the one that's worried me the most and I think inspired my whole end of this discussion with you, is that there's an entire generation of young artcomix makers whose work just isn't being reviewed at all. …An entire generation, an entire movement, of altcomix creators who are doing vital, defiant, personal work is badly undeserved by criticism, and that will have a huge effect on both comics and comics criticism moving forward.” [emphasis mine]
This might certainly be of concern for readers (and critics) with a long term interest in sustaining the comics grassroots. It might in fact be seen as the duty of committed blog aggregators (with a compliant readership) to push links to these sites on a more frequent basis and for publishers to consider the best of these for print publication and more sustainable retailing. Comics critics who see themselves as evangelists and want to sideline as marketing agents for the small press may also choose to delve into this. Indeed, the vast majority of comics reviews do in fact fall into the category of marketing. There is no reason why these hats cannot be put on or taken off at will. There are even college courses in marketing for those so inclined. One might even consider being reborn as Peter Laird (of the Xeric Foundation) or Kevin Eastman (of Tundra).
But all this is of secondary importance to the state of comics criticism. Last time I checked, The Comics Journal was supposed to be the magazine of news and criticism, not the Journal of Comics Marketing. Collins' concern that the artists of the Happiness anthologies are not being reviewed suggests that they are concerned that they are not being covered positively and disseminated widely—that they are not being sold to a whole generation of readers. This would appear to be the primary purpose of comics criticism in Collins' view.
I beg to differ. If you want to sell things, then sell them—send them to famous cartoonists, influential publishers, and comics critics who are interested in selling things. One influential Tweet by a comics celebrity will do more good than a 3000-word review of the highest quality produced by a nobody. And for god's sake, don't send your comics to critics who want to criticize them. Find someone who cares more about how many copies you sell than about the quality of your work. If we could only separate these comics critics from comics marketers, comics criticism might be in a more healthy state.
Comics must be the only art form where the most prominent commentators in the field (who shall remain nameless) regularly dismiss or deprioritize discussions of the art form they are engaging in. The art form I am referring to is not comics but criticism. Santoro's comment that they “noticed that [he] wasn't taking the time to read long reviews or blog posts” (in the last few years) is not a new phenomenon but purely a symptom of this modern age—an age of endless distractions and diminishing attentions spans. The idea that someone might take a copy of The Comics Journal on a long plane flight as reading material (as Tucker Stone has admitted to doing at least once) could be taken as a sign of mental illness or at least an eccentric attitude towards comics.
Comics criticism doesn't actually need more people who are interested in comics (that is a given considering the insular nature of the hobby); what it needs is people who are interested in criticism. Collins' main concern—that the comics they likes aren't being reviewed—is understandable but should be of little concern to comics criticism per se.
* * *
Santoro and Collins began their discussion with much broader concerns, starting with the number of comics reviews being published of late. This question of quantity is first directed at Collins who answers:
“Less. Certainly less than far as alternative/art/literary/underground comics go. It seems as though there's as much of a profusion of reviews of superhero comics as ever.”
Any proclamations on this topic are guaranteed to be anecdotal and unscientific but my impression is that there has not been a drop in the quantity of long form criticism concerning non-superhero related comics since I started monitoring the field more closely. Santoro suggests that there was an apparent golden age from 2008-2009 “when 1000-word reviews were common.” No doubt quality is always preferable to quantity but a 1000-words can hardly be considered the high watermark of long form criticism. Perhaps it is the bare minimum Santoro demands but 1000-words often suggests:
(1) “I don't have enough space or money to pay you for more”, OR
(2) “I don't want to waste my brain cells on this so I'm going to vomit out whatever is on the tip of my tongue”.
600 words for opinion and short analysis (at best), 300 words for the gloss and information, and 100 words for padding and style don't often add up to much in terms of essential reading for the informed except in rare circumstances. A little more leeway might be found in instances where the work has been thoroughly assimilated by the comics community and a tighter focus brought to bear on the subject matter. 1000-words is of course the “industry standard” for long form criticism and not something to be especially proud of. As a purveyor of this kind of material, I should know. The call for 500-word reviews (to increase coverage) during the closing years of the print Journal certainly heralded the arrival of poorly substantiated opinion as opposed to analysis. A publisher's synopsis and an Amazon.com comment would have worked just as well in this instance.
The short form approving review or “call to purchase” is tailor-made for the comics critical community, a grouping which is largely unpaid and interested primarily in fellowship—the generation of comments and making friends on Facebook and Twitter. Collins points to this early in the exchange where they write:
“It's exceedingly easy to type up your strongest single impression of a new work and post it to Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr, and receive feedback almost immediately. And since your strongest single impression could be nothing more complex than “This is SO GOOD, you guys,” and the feedback can just be a like or a fav or a reblog or a retweet or a share, it's tough to build up a thoroughgoing interrogation of a comic. The energy is diffused.”
The motivations for writing comics criticism are many and this is but one possibility. Some might do it for pocket change while others might participate in the interest of generating a conversation by which process they might attain enlightenment or at least a modicum of self-improvement. If one desires a large readership and a huge reception on Twitter, then an article on a superhero comic would increase the probability of this (preferably a controversial one). To expect a substantial response when writing a review of an alternative comic with a readership in the low thousands (or hundreds) at best would be to deny reality. At the risk of stating the obvious, people are interested in what they're interested in. They are unlikely to read, comment on, or even click on a link to an article about a comic or subject of which they know nothing about. In fact, the best way for a comics critic to get an audience is to not write about comics at all—easily one of the least popular art forms extant today.
The problems associated with writing good, well researched long form comics criticism mirror those found in the creation of alternative comics with a marginal readership. The present day solution to these problems is echoed in both endeavors. If one desires quality criticism of the alternatives in the field then an altogether different attitude (and critic) is required. This is the kind of critic who primarily writes for themselves or at least because of some deep inner need (pompously metaphysical as this may sound). It is a simple equation. You write criticism because you have something to say, because you feel compelled to write about it, and because you want to do the best job you can (as would any artisan). The need for an audience (and this is an ever present gnawing desire) must come only after this. The available readership for comics criticism is limited by the popularity of the form and the attractions of the topic or comic being written about; much less so the quality of the criticism.
An actual increase in the volume of comics criticism is not necessarily desirable or even achievable considering the state of the industry and art form. A different lesson presents itself if one considers the titans of comics. Kirby's oeuvre, for instance, would have been substantially enhanced had they the luxury to draw and write less and not more comics. In the same vein, I would much prefer it if unusually prolific critics would write substantially less but longer and more considered reviews. Which makes Collins' point later in the exchange appear somewhat wrongheaded:
“My point, ultimately, is that without a sufficient volume of reviews being written, you're not going to see needed critiques — particularly since most people are writing for little or no money, and most humans like enjoying themselves if they're not getting paid, and it's generally easier to enjoy yourself if you're thinking about something you like instead of something you don't.”
It is not critical volume which is required but concentrated quality. The idea of twenty 500-word articles on Alternative Comics X does not please my mind in the least and would certainly not be an advancement over just one good long form article on the same comic.
Monitoring the comics critical scene is an endless drudge considering how often blog aggregators point me to worthless plot synopses and marketing copy masquerading as reviews. Even worse is how little effort they spend differentiating between this excrement and the truly worthy articles which generally get lost in the shuffle. In any case, the state of coverage is considerably better than was the case back in the 80s and 90s when The Comics Journal (the print version) was virtually the only game in town when it came to non-superhero related material. Not being reviewed in the Journal (for good or ill) in those days was tantamount to not getting reviewed at all. Since then, the state of comics criticism has been enriched by voices emerging from the fields of academia; a not surprising new source considering this grouping's dedication to thinking, reading, and writing about things. A number of these writers emerged from fandom and it is high time fandom looked beyond its own narrow shores to the wider world of critical writing if only in the interest of improving itself.

Side note:
Noah commented twice on the article at TCJ.com; I understand with some irritation that the site you are reading was left out of the conversation when it turned to subjects such as long form comics criticism and analysis, extended comments sections on subjects other than superheroes, female writers, and coverage of non-superhero related material.
They should not be surprised or overly concerned. To put it bluntly, The Hooded Utilitarian is a pariah site as far as the traditional comics community is concerned—reviled primarily because of its owner and a lack of correct communal spirit. Others might add lies, bad faith, and a lack of “professionalism” to the mix. To expect consideration from a school of comics criticism which you have rejected is perhaps asking far too much. Like a lump of shit, the only instance in which they might care to notice this site is if they stepped on it accidentally.
HU is not exceptional in its pariah status. The manga community is yet another example of a group of “comics untouchables”, a community with women writers and readers in far greater abundance than on HU. Which leads to the inevitable conclusion that, for all intents and purposes, women are the Dalits of comics, alienated by virtue of the types of conversations which engage the longstanding comics critical community of males. It might be that in their view, it is the men who helm the traditional comics conversation who are to be avoided. They also don't need anyone to fight their battles for them (see comments by Peggy Burns, Sarah Horrocks, and Leah at the original article) .
N ow that we are are nearing the midpoint of the 2010-2011season, it's time to once again take a look at which players top our NCAA Player of the Year Rankings for January. Over the past month, several teams like Missouri, Xavier, and Indiana have finally succumbed to their first defeats of the season, and rightly so, our player rankings reflect that. In our final rankings of the 2011 calendar year, Ohio State big man Jared Sullinger topped our list, followed closely by Connecticut's Jeremy Lamb, and Kentucky's fabulous first-year student Anthony Davis. But after continued top notch performances by Baylor's Perry Jones III, Creighton's Doug McDermott, and Kansas' Thomas Robinson, can Sullinger hold on to the top spot? Check out our NCAA POY Rankings for January 2011:
Murray State 18.5 ppg, 4.1 ast, 3.2 reb, 1.4 stl, .486 3PT% Team Record – 18-0 Although the Racers, along with Syracuse and Baylor, remain the nation's only undefeated teams, not many across the country have heard of Canaan, who is one of the best backcourt players in the country. The junior guard has had numerous 30+ point scoring games on the season, in addition to sinking 5 or more treys in 4 contests. The Racers stand as best a chance as any of the 3 remaining unbeatens of going undeafeated, as they are undoubtedly the class of the Ohio Valley Conference.
Missouri 17.9 ppg, 5.3 reb, 2.6 ast, 1.5 stl, .435 3PT% Team Record – 16-1 Previous Ranking – 9 While most so-called experts have decided to drop Marcus from their POY rankings after just a few subpar showings over the past month, they have shown me that they belong ranked mong the nation's top backcourt players. Since our last rankings, Marcus has 6 double figures scoring games, include an 18 point, 11 rebounds, 3 assist effort against Big 12 foe Texas. They remain one of the nation's best perimeter shooters and is currently 2nd in the Big 12 in scoring behind the Longhorns' J'Covan Brown. Fellow Tiger backcourt mate Kim English and imposing big man Ricardo Ratliffe also deserve credit in helping Mizzou remain ranked in the Top 10 in the polls.
Syracuse 13.7 ppg, 4.7 reb, 1.8 ast, 1.5 stl, .395 3PT% Team Record – 19-0 Previous Ranking – Honorable Mention As the best player on the nation's top ranked team, Joseph deserves mention among the country's elite players. Although they don't put up insane scoring numbers or grab 10+ rebounds per night, they do a little bit of everything in helping the Cuse remain one of the nation's 3 remaining undefeated teams. Joseph is shooting nearly 40% from long range, uses their above average athleticism to beat opposing forwards to the rim, and has scored in double figures in 14 games. Joseph, along with super 6th man Dion Waiters, and the much improving 2nd year center Fab Melo on the defensive side of the ball also deserve mention in helping the Orangemen off to their best start in 11 years.
Creighton 24.2 ppg, 8.4 reb, 1.4 ast, .623 FG%, .569 3PT% Team Record – 15-2 Previous Ranking – Honorable Mention As long as the Blue Jays keep winning, McDermott is beginning to get more attention as arguably the best mid-major player in the country. As this season's version of Jimmer Fredette, he's one of the nation's best offensive players, ranking among the Top 5 in the country in scoring and 3 point shooting. Many questions their level of competition in the Missouri Valley, but McDermott has more than done their part in helping earn Creighton a lofty top 15 national ranking. Their impressive 44 point outbursts vs Bradley on January 7th has also opened some eyes of NBA scouts as well.
North Carolina 16.8 ppg, 4.8 reb, 1.1 stl, .478 FG%, .442 3PT% Team Record – 15-3 Previous Ranking – 5 After a great early season start, Barnes' play has been a tad erratic, scoring in single digits in 3 games since our last rankings. There's no denying that Barnes has all of the skills to be a dominating offensive player, but their demeanor has been passive at times. Fellow Tarheels John Henson, Tyler Zeller, and sophomore PG Kendall Marshall also deserve mention in helping UNC to another Top 10 national ranking. Even with the uneven play at times, Barnes remains one of the nation's elite players and should be a lock as a Lottery pick in the 2012 NBA Draft.
Michigan State 15.8 ppg, 10.1 reb, 3.4 ast, 1.5 stl, .407 3PT% Team Record – 15-3 Previous Ranking – NR Green is hands down one of the nation's top seniors and stat stuffers. In what could have been a down year for the Spartans, Green has emerged as coach Izzo's de-facto leader with the younger crop of Spartans like Keith Appling and Branden Dawson still finding their way as elite NCAA players. Prior to this weekend's hiccup at the hands of Northwestern, Green had helped the Spartans reel off 15 straight wins after losing to UNC and Duke early. Green is among the Big Ten leaders in scoring, 3 point shooting, and ranks among the top 5 in the nation in rebounding behind an amazing 11 double-doubles.
Connecticut 17.9 ppg, 4.2 reb, 1.9 ast, 1.6 stl, .502 FG% Team Record – 14-3 Previous Ranking – 2 Lambs improvement from last season has been remarkable. There's no denying that they are one of the most potent offensive players in the nation but their play has been erratic as of late, scoring only 39 points in their last 3 contests. When on their game, Lamb has been unstoppable, notching six 20+ point games on the season, including a 30 point outburst on the opening night vs Columbia. Fellow sophomore Shabazz Napier and the quickly developing first-year student phenom Andre Drummond also deserve mention here in helping the Huskies win 9 of their last 11 contests, including a 4-2 mark in the Big East.
Kentucky 13.1 ppg, 10.2 reb, 4.6 blk, .643 FG% Team Record – 17-1 Previous Ranking – 3 While Kentucky gets outstanding production from fellow first-year student and emotional leader Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Davis remains the Wildcats game-changing player. Although they still have a ways to go offensively, they either blocks or dunks everything at the rim. Davis leads the nation in blocks and is among the Top 5 in FG% and rebounding. Davis has helped the Wildcats to 9 straight wins, including a perfect 4-0 start in SEC play. Since our last rankings, Davis leads all players in double-doubles with 6. It wouldn't be a shock to see Davis as the #1 player on everyone's 2012 NBA Draft board.
Baylor 13.8 ppg, 7.7 reb, 1.2 ast, .556 FG% Team Record – 17-0 Previous Ranking – 6 Despite getting help from teammates Quincy Acy, Pierre Jackson, and first-year student Quincy Miller, Jones remains the enigmatic player that most opposing defenses game-plan for. Their amazing blend of size and athleticism have made them a match-up nightmare, helping the Bears remain one of only 3 teams still undefeated on the season. Jones still remains passive at times but has shown the ability to be unguardable when they set their mind to it. They have 5 double digit scoring games and 2 double-doubles to their credit since our last rankings and will undoubtedly be the central figure in helping the Bears attempt to dethrone Kansas in the Big 12 race.
Kansas 17.2 ppg, 12.2 reb, 1.6 ast, .538 FG% Team Record – 14-3 Previous Ranking – 7 Is there any doubt that Robinson does more for their squad than any player in the country? Devoid of many stand-out stars on this year's Jayhawk team, the sophomore big man has emerged from the shadows of the Morris twins last year and has become one of the most dominating low post players in college basketball. Robinson ranks among the Big 12 leaders in scoring, FG%, blocks, and steals, and is tied for the nations lead in double-doubles with 12. Their 30 point, 21 rebounds, 4 assist effort against North Dakota on December 31st ranks as one of the best individual games of the season.  They are the key figure in the Jayhawks 7 game winning streak, including a perfect 4-0 start in the Big 12.
Another day of violence in South Africa's Parliament, another session with President Jacob Zuma offering puzzling answers to questions on Nkandla. It could perhaps be just another day in paradise if you were deaf to the alarm bells being rung by Pravin Gordhan, Robert McBride, Anwa Dramat and Ivan Pillay about the menacing threat to our democracy. In a worrying statement, Gordhan appealed to South Africans to “protect” National Treasury staff. Meanwhile Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has warned there will be no peace until Zuma leaves office. By RANJENI MUNUSAMY.
As a large group of burly men who make up the parliamentary protection services filed into the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon to muscle EFF members out of the House, another group of security officers stepped into the chamber to surround President Jacob Zuma. Although the president was not under any threat, a protection force assembled around them just in case. Again Zuma sat impassively, shielded by this group of armed men, as elected representatives were beaten and carried out of the chamber.
It is a sign of the times. Upheaval and violence, now the essence of South African life, while the elite remain cocooned. Zuma, in particular, remains fortified while the onslaught on democracy intensifies.
As fighting and scenes of pandemonium played out in the corridors, Zuma took to the podium chuckling. Once again they seemed unperturbed by the violence that occurred, even when a Democratic Alliance (DA) MP shouted at him, “This happened because of you!”
There was a time after the Constitutional Court delivered judgment on the Nkandla matter when Zuma seemed to be on the back foot. They appeared under pressure from the chorus of voices speaking out against their violation of the Constitution and calling for them to step down.
But Zuma has clearly bounced back. When asked by DA leader Mmusi Maimane to provide proof of their bond for the Nkandla homestead, Zuma was back in performance mode, explaining that they had done nothing wrong and that they and their family paid for the buildings. They told MPs to “just keep quiet and listen”, saying the only problems identified by the public protector were the five non-security features.
“These items, they represent the kraal‚ fowl run‚ swimming pool … um‚ yebo … fire pool, yes fire pool‚ and a waiting room and the amphitheatre. Five. They are not talking about a house that people live in with bedrooms and living rooms,” Zuma said.
When asked by DA MP James Selfe what collateral they had used to get a bond, Zuma said they used a “PTO” (Permission to Occupy). It is not clear how a lease agreement was used as surety to get a bond.
Zuma regained their political footing in the ANC on the basis of the “apology” they offered the nation following the Constitutional Court judgment on Nkandla. Judging by what they said in Parliament on Tuesday, Zuma is still not apologetic about the Nkandla fiasco or the amount of taxpayers' money blown on their personal home.
And when asked about the dodgy dealings of their friends, the Guptas, Zuma was even more dismissive. “I know nothing about the business dealings of the Guptas. Why should I have a view?” they asked.
While Zuma is back in top form, seemingly impervious to the turmoil around him, the strain on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is intensifying. Gordhan issued a statement on Tuesday evening saying media reports about the Hawks' plans to arrest them had been “extremely distressing for my family and me”.
“I cannot believe that I am being investigated and could possibly be charged for something I am completely innocent of. I have answered the questions submitted by the Hawks, and have not heard from them,” Gordhan said. “It is indeed true that no one is above the law. But no one should be subjected to the manipulation of the law and agencies for ulterior motives.”
The emotional toll on Gordhan was evident: “Throughout my 45 years of activism, I have worked for the advancement of the ANC, our Constitution and our democratic government. I would never have thought that individuals within the very agencies of this government would now conspire to intimidate and harass me and my family.”
They said their lawyers would be approaching the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority for further information and clarity about the case against him.
“The malicious rumours and accusations about ‘espionage' activities are false and manufactured for other motives,” Gordhan said.
They also referred to a Daily Maverick report that one of the Gupta brothers had revealed at a business meeting that Gordhan was to be arrested and replaced as finance minister.
“There have also been reports of businesspeople claiming inside knowledge of or influence over state institutions. If such reports are true, that alleged conduct will undermine the integrity and honesty within the Treasury or other key institutions,” Gordhan said.
They issued a dire warning about the “unrestrained attack on honest and hardworking people and the institutions meant to strengthen our democracy.
“Millions of people will pay the price (there will be less money to relieve poverty and support job creation programmes) if this subversion of democracy is left unrestrained and unchallenged,” Gordhan said.
In the most revealing statement about the onslaught against their department, Gordhan said:
“I appeal to all South Africans to protect the National Treasury staff, who have diligently, honestly and skilfully served the national interest to the best of their ability.”
A strong declaration of support came from their former comrades Robert McBride, Anwa Dramat and Ivan Pillay. In a detailed statement on the attack against state institutions, McBride, Dramat and Pillay said there appeared to be a pattern in which government officials are removed from their positions using baseless allegations, media leaks and investigations against them.
“It appears that the pattern of questionable processes has also been applied to the recent interactions of the Hawks with the Minister of Finance,” they said.
“Corruption is the biggest threat to our constitutional democracy. This cancer has turned former comrades against each other. People who shared the same trenches in the fight for liberation are now at each other's throats for the sake of protecting corrupt activities,” McBride, Dramat and Pillay said.
“We will continue to use our experience and expertise to investigate, fight and expose corrupt activities in the private and public sector.”
They too made a public appeal:
“We call on those in business, civil society, organised labour, NGOs and the general public who value and want to defend our constitutional democracy, to assist our efforts with legal advice and expertise and legal and financial resources.”
EFF leader Julius Malema is signalling a different method to defend South Africa's democracy. Speaking outside Parliament after being forcibly ejected and violent bouts with parliamentary security, an enraged Malema said Zuma should never see peace for the remainder of their term.
“Zuma is not our president. The day they breached the Constitution, that's the day they kissed the office of president goodbye… The only thing that will bring peace here is when Zuma resigns as a sign of respect to Constitutional Court and Constitution‚” Malema said.
They said Zuma should not be allowed to address Parliament because they had broken their oath of office.
“You will thank us once we restore the dignity of this Parliament by removing Zuma,” Malema said. “These bouncers must know that if they bring violence‚ we will respond with violence. We are not scared… Anyone who manhandles us must know we have got the same capacity. No one has monopoly on violence.”
In a time of social and economic turmoil, where schools are burnt down by angry communities and violence has become routine in the House of Parliament, the warning lights are flashing about the state of our nation. Gordhan's warning should not be treated lightly: if the subversion of our democracy is left “unrestrained and unchallenged”, millions will indeed pay the price.
This is no longer about the individuals caught in the vortex; it is about rescuing our nation before it becomes yet another tragic story on a continent constantly being destroyed and reborn. Our rebirth too is possible and hopefully it will come before so much more is destroyed. DM

Reuters After a change to national gun law on Tuesday, Russians can now carry certain guns in public for the purposes of "self-defense."
The new policy allows the use of weapons to "protect their lives, health and property" but not against "women, disabled persons, and minors, unless they attacked you with a group and arms," according to an analysis by Russian media site Arguments and Facts.
These weapons include "long-barreled weapons, pistols, revolvers, 'home-made tubeless firearm units' with cartridges, bullets and ammunition; gas pistols and revolvers, electric shock devices, devices equipped with tear gas, and home-made spark gaps," according to the state-owned TASS news agency.
Additionally, those who have attained licenses are prohibited from carrying weapons during rallies, meetings, demonstrations, recreational activities, and religious ceremonies, according to Arguments and Facts. During certain events and parades, however, cossacks and participants of the events are allowed to carry swords as part of their costumes.
Prior to the change, weapons were only allowed for hunting and sporting events, as well as training and shooting practice. Laws also prohibited rifles, pistols, and revolvers, according to GunPolicy.org.
Many Russians, however, don't approve of this amendment. "Horrified. I am horrified," one Muscovite told Business Insider.
Additionally, Russian politician and former deputy of the State Dumas, Russia's current Commissioner for Human Rights Ella Pamfilova said, "I have a very negative attitude to this decision, I believe that it is fraught with many dangerous and tragic consequences. I don't doubt that it will increase the number of accidents — the use of these weapons in the heat of passion."
Currently, only 46% of Russians feel safe walking alone at night, compared to a global average of 82%, according to the Legatum Group's annual survey of global prosperity.
Gunpolicy.org estimates the number of both legal and illegal guns in Russia at 12,750,000, making the rate of private ownership about 9 firearms for every 100 people. The rate of registered ownership, however, falls much lower — 3.5 guns per 100 people.
For comparison, the U.S. has nearly 20 times more guns than Russia (on the low end of the spectrum), anywhere from 270 to 360 million. Therefore, the estimated rate of private ownerships is also much higher: 101.5 firearms per 100 people.
In 2013, 8,454 people were murdered at the hands of someone wielding a gun in the U.S., according to FBI Statistics. Unfortunately, Russia doesn't break down its homicides by weapon.
Speaking the same day as the change, President Vladimir Putin said: "You can get a lot more done with politeness and a weapon than with politeness alone," according to the New Republic.
Russell Street Report Lombardi's Way RAVENS NEWS AND NOTES: Offense to Get Physical
Today the Ravens hosted a chalk talk session with the media to expand the knowledge of NFL concepts. The focus this morning was offense and the presenters were offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and offensive line coach Juan Castillo.
Also involved in the presentation were assistant coaches Tom Hammock, Brian Pariani and Rick Dennison.
The session was really intended to boost the football IQ of the media – a tutorial of sorts to help improve the coverage and level of intelligence when reporting or opining on the Ravens and the NFL.
A few notes from the session that don't include trade secrets…
Quarterbacks coach Rick Dennison has offensive line coaching experience and was once an assistant to one of the game's innovators in the running game, Alex Gibbs…Kubiak emphasized that the game is played through matchups and walked the audience through the numeric system often used around the league to quickly define personnel groupings.
Kubiak stressed the importance of running the same plays out of various sub packages so that the Ravens don't dictate play calling through their personnel groupings…Kubiak broke down several plays, most of which were stretch runs (Texans v. Bengals Wild Card Game footage) featuring zone blocking or play action off such runs…It's pretty clear that the Ravens want to run the football and just as clear that they plan to get physical.
The Ravens featured the pistol formation often in 2013 and while they aren't opposed to more of the same, expect Kubiak to feature Joe Flacco under center more in 2014. The Ravens OC believes that running plays get to the line of scrimmage faster when the quarterback is under center.
Harbaugh Notes
The Ravens head coach fielded a few questions early on from the media and in no particular order mentioned:
* The Ravens believe that safety Darian Stewart can be a starter and said that their skill set hasn't been Stewart's biggest problem in their search for consistency – durability is.
* The Ravens will add another running back to improve competition at the position. Ray Rice's domestic situation is a concern but perhaps a bigger concern may be Bernard Pierce who wasn't even mentioned during the session. It's possible that the team is trying to send the former Temple Owl a message. If motivated and healthy Kubiak's offense is a solid fit for Pierce's running style – a style often compared to that of Arian Foster.
* The Ravens are looking for quality depth everywhere and will add via free agency, the draft and undrafted free agents.
* Harbaugh acknowledged the need for another corner and seems confident in Chykie Brown and Asa Jackson. They will have to step up because according to Harbs, “Corey Graham will be missed.”
* The positions of backup quarterback, right tackle and tight end were brought up and Harbaugh wasn't bashful about mentioning the name of Owen Daniels again. They also alluded to the possibility of bringing along other former players of Kubiak's. Both Harbaugh and Kubiak mentioned Ed Dickson.
* For the moment and barring any additions via free agency or the draft, competing for the opening on the offensive line will be Ricky Wagner, Jah Reid and Ryan Jensen. An impressive Jensen could bump Kelechi Osemele out to right tackle.
MALONE, N.Y. - The escaped murderer who was shot by a state trooper near the Canadian border is in serious condition at an Albany hospital, a spokesperson said.
David Sweat's condition had been downgraded to critical after initially being flown to Albany Medical Center on Sunday night, but an evaluation there determined "he did not require any surgeries," said hospital director Dennis P. McKenna in a statement.
"David Sweat will remain at Albany Medical Center for at least a few days while their condition stabilizes," McKenna said.
Sweat was shot twice in the torso on Sunday afternoon by New York State Police Sgt. Jay Cook just before their capture, reports CBS affiliate WCAX in Burlington, Vermont. Cook was alone when they spotted a suspicious looking man just walking down the road. At first, the man ignored Cook upon initial approach, but when they turned around, the officer realized it was the escaped prisoner. Sweat took off running for a tree line, and then Cook opened fire, fearing they would lose the man in the woods.
Cook has been hailed as a hero for their actions.
Sweat is one of two prisoners who escaped from a maximum-security New York prison three weeks ago. the prison break was the first escape from the maximum-security portion of the prison since it was built in 1865. The other escapee, Richard Matt, was killed in a confrontation with law enforcement on Friday.
Cuomo said Sweat had a bag containing maps, tools, bug repellent and Pop Tarts when they were shot by Cook in a farm field less than two miles from the border in Constable, New York.
Police stand over David Sweat after they were shot and captured near the Canadian border Sunday, June 28, 2015, in Constable, N.Y. AP
The daring escape from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora was "done with facilitators, it was done with cooperators," Cuomo said.
"This was 'Cool Hand Luke' meets 'Shawshank Redemption," they said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."
After Sweat was shot, some of the same state troopers who'd been hunting down the convicts since their escape found themselves scrambling to get the lone survivor to a hospital, hoping to make them well enough to share the tale of how the pair managed to escape and stay on the run for so long.
The capture of Sweat came two days after Matt was killed in Malone, just south of Constable, while holding a shotgun. Sweat was unarmed when they were shot.
What's next for captured fugitive David Sweat?
Escaped inmate Richard Matt killed
Matt - who once vowed never to be taken alive - was sick and drunk when police caught up with him, according to a report. Investigators told the newspaper that the finding of Matt's soiled underwear before they caught up with them indicated they were likely ill from consuming contaminated food or water.
One of the tips that led investigators to Matt was a local reporting one of their cabins having been broken into, with empty or half-drunken bottles of booze lying everywhere, the Buffalo News reports. Officials said Matt's corpse reeked of alcohol.
The men had been on the loose since June 6, when they cut their way out of the prison in Dannemora, about 30 miles from Malone, using power tools. Two prison workers have been charged with helping them.
Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer, charged with promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct, is due in court Monday. Their attorney has said they will plead not guilty.
Officials said Palmer gave the two prisoners frozen hamburger meat that a prison tailoring shop instructor had used to hide the tools they smuggled to Sweat and Matt. Palmer's attorney said they had no knowledge that the meat contained hacksaw blades, a bit and a screwdriver.
Prison employee allegedly had sexual relations with escapee
Prosecutors said the tailor shop worker, Joyce Mitchell, got close to the men while working with them and had agreed to be their getaway driver but backed out because they felt guilty for participating in the escape. Authorities also said Mitchell had discussed killing their husband as part of the plot.
Mitchell has been accused of having sexual relations with one of the prisoners. Them husband, Lyle Mitchell, has refuted the claims.
Joyce Mitchell pleaded not guilty June 15 to charges including felony promoting prison contraband.
Sweat's capture ended an ordeal that sent 1,300 law enforcement officers into the thickly forested northern reaches of New York and forced residents to tolerate nerve-wracking armed checkpoints and property searches.
"The nightmare is finally over," Cuomo declared at a news conference.
While the exact plans the escapees had laid out are still not clear, many suspect the location of their capture is a big clue.
"I can only assume they were going for the border," Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said.
D'Amico said the men may have used black pepper to throw off their scent from the dogs that were tracking them; they said Sweat's DNA was recovered from pepper shakers found at one camp where the fugitives may have spent time.
Prison escape plot thickens with second arrest
Cuomo said many questions remained unanswered in the case, including whether the inmates had other accomplices.
"We have already started a full investigation," they said. "But today ends with good news. These were dangerous, dangerous men."
Sweat had not been formally interviewed by investigators as of late Sunday, but any information they provide could be critical to the investigation, Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said.
Sweat will be charged with escape, burglary and other charges, Wylie said. They and Matt are suspected of breaking into some of the region's many cabins during their time on the lam. Wylie said prosecutors would wait for Sweat to recover before charging him.
What's next in the New York prison escape investigation?
Matt, 49, and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, squirmed through pipes and emerged from a manhole outside Clinton Correctional.
Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of their former boss.
Authorities said the men had filled their beds in their adjacent cells with clothes to make it appear they were sleeping when guards made overnight rounds. On a cut steam pipe, the prisoners left a taunting note containing a crude caricature of an Asian face and the words "Have a nice day."
Prosecutors said the inmates apparently used tools stored by prison contractors, taking care to return them to their toolboxes after each night's work.

Looks like HTC has quietly slipped its users a spying app that tracks an alarming amount of user behavior and sends that data off to itself and perhaps others via a mysterious service in the cloud. The snooping app came nestled with the 2.3.4 Android update pushed out to some of its smartphones such as the Sensation 4G and EVO 4G.
TrevE and Team Synergy of the InfectedROM site (and XDA fame), discovered the app. HTC includes an application called Carrier IQ and Carrier IQ recently added a user-behavior logging feature called IQ Insight Experience Manager.
According to the Carrier IQ website: "IQ Insight Experience Manager uses data directly from the mobile phone itself to give a precise view of how users interact with both their phones and the services delivered through them, even if the phone is not communicating with the network. ... Identify exactly how your customers interact with services and which ones they use. See which content they consume, even offline."
But wait there's more. Turns out that after HTC collects these stats, CIQ isn't the only app with access to them. TrevE writes:
"CIQ is meant to monitor user activity and send logs off to wherever. Shortly after seeing this, team synergy went to work finding out exactly what was being done. ... Come to find out, CIQ is not the only part of android responsible for sending these stats. They get written out by framework to 4 major locations."
The four locations are ...
1- /data/system/appusagestats: Hosts a file that seems to collect every Android intent used on the phone. An intent is abstract description of an operation to be performed and is used, for instance, to launch activities. An intent is used to dial the phone, display the contact information and so on.
2- /data/system/usagestats - Team Synergy concluded that these are Google usage stats collecting much the same data as appusagestats and possibly sending this data somewhere else.
3- /data/system/userbehavior.db -- This looked to hold the IP address where the data is sent. They discovered two IP addresses in their phone going to Amazon cloud services.
4- /data/system/dropbox -- TrevE writes, "Now this is interesting, there were over 500 files in this directory. When we deleted everything in this folder and opened market, logcat reported errors looking for these files. Why is the market looking for these files on start?"
Do HTC users have the right to complain -- or even opt out of this snooping behavior? Apparently, not if the HTC license agreement is to be believed, points out Chris Chavez, on the Phandroid site.
They note that users apparently are required to agree. Look at Settings > About Phone > Legal > HTC Legal and you'll find that HTC tells you it is collecting information. Each device has been allocated with "one or more unique identification numbers," the agreement says, It later adds: "HTC might share non-personal, aggregated information with selected third parties. However such information will not identify you personally." The privacy statement goes on like that for quite a few paragraphs, on the one hand explaining that it is gathering information, and that it reserves the right to share it, but promising that the data won't be personally identifiable.
Now the good folks at Team Synergy have, of course, managed to kill off the app and remove it from the framework locations and have provided this code on a ROM. Unfortunately, ROM flashing and fiddling with system apps requires root access. And more unfortunately, as soon as you root your phone, the snooping app will know and could tell HTC, voiding your phone warranty.
One aspect of litigation that is usually missing from the lawyer shows is the sheer volume of time spent arguing over tangential issues that are critical to what the rules say the parties can do/say/get in court, but are themselves only loosely correlated to the extent of the defendant's guilt. You spend months fighting over whether the plaintiff's headquarters are really in that office and not that office, because then they reside in that state and can't bring their claims in this court. You spend weeks trying to get complete discovery on this guy's lunch break privileges because it might make them an “employee” and not a “contractor” so then you can impute their actions to their employer and use that to bring this other company into the case.
A law you may have heard of, the RICO Act, at least on the civil side, practically exists in 2016 solely to create these stupid fights. I hate the RICO Act. (Note: From here on out, a lawyer might fairly quibble that I'm glossing over some big caveats and limitations when I discuss this law. To an extent I am, but I think I'm capturing the essence of the issue for a layperson.)
In 1967, the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, established two years prior by President Lyndon Johnson, published their landmark study, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society.
Among the many topics discussed in the report was the danger of organized crime, an issue that had first come to public awareness in the 1950s. The report stated that while “[t]he core of organized crime activity” was in supplying vices like gambling, loan sharking, and narcotics, “organized crime is also extensively and deeply involved in legitimate business and in labor unions,” using illegitimate methods like “monopolization, terrorism, extortion, [and] tax evasion to drive out or control lawful ownership and leadership to exact illegal profits from the public.” Further, “to carry out its many activities secure from government interference, organized crime corrupts public officials.”
To make it easier to prosecute criminal leaders who kept their hands off the blue-collar crimes, the report recommended stiffer penalties for felonies “committed as part of a continuing illegal business” where the defendant occupied a supervisory or other management position. Shortly thereafter, several bills were introduced in the Senate to carry out this recommendation. After several revisions, amendments, and updated bills, the president signed Senate Bill 30 – the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970.
The RICO statutes make it a felony to
(a) use any money received “from a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt” to acquire an interest in, establish, or operate an enterprise that engages in interstate commerce(i.e., use money from your extortion racket to open a “legitimate business”);
(b) acquire or maintain control of a business“through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt” (i.e., take over a business by threatening to kill the owners or by calling in illegal gambling debts);
(c) conduct or participate “in the conduct of [an] enterprises' affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt” (i.e., use the “legitimate business” as a front to commit crimes); and
(d) conspire to do any of the above.
18 U.S. Code § 1961 et seq.
Like many other laws addressing crimes against the public, the RICO Act created a private right of action for any victim harmed by a RICO violation, entitling them to recover “threefold the damages they sustain and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorneys fee.”
This is where shit starts going off the rails.
RICO was designed to target mobsters and gangsters who take over businesses, but very quickly that purpose was tossed aside. While “Congress viewed RICO principally as a tool for attacking the specific problem of infiltration of legitimate business by organized criminal syndicates . . . . Few notable RICO prosecutions have dealt directly with this sort of criminal activity.” Gerard E. Lynch, "Rico: The Crime of Being a Criminal," Columbia Law Review, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 661, May 1987. Instead, most criminal RICO prosecutions “have been directed at the operations of illegitimate criminal enterprises themselves.”
What Lynch is talking about is the way prosecutors have mostly ignored prongs (a) and (b) – the ones about using dirty money or muscling into a business -- to focus on prong (c), which is about running the business like a gangster. Because RICO was originally meant to attack mob takeovers of ostensibly legal commerce, it was basically written to say, “it's now a felony to take over and run a legitimate business like criminals.” But in practice, prosecutors wield subsection (c) by finding a criminal organization and saying, “Hey, your criminal organization is committing a bunch of crimes. You're guilty of committing those crimes, you're guilty of conspiring to commit those crimes, and you're guilty of the crime of using your criminal organization to commit those crimes.” As another writer put it, "RICO acts as an arbitrary penalty enhancer and prosecutorial bargaining tool. A violation of RICO is a crime of convenience—for prosecutors, that is." William L. Anderson & Candice E. Jackson, "Law as a Weapon How RICO Subverts Liberty and the True Purpose of Law," The Independent Review (Summer 2004). (Quick aside, I think this is a great quote but these are horrible fucking people. The Independent Review is a libertarian mouthpiece and Jackson used to be litigation counsel at Judicial Watch, who are just the fucking worst. I presume Anderson sucks as well. They can all go fuck themselves with a rusty hammer. But I do like that quote.)
While the pile-on of charges is familiar in criminal court, on the civil side these things can be game changers. Treble damages is a huge cudgel – it's no picnic seeing your $27 million liability jump up to $80 million. And the fee-shifting provision means that if plaintiffs can successfully plead a RICO claim, their lawsuit becomes free – an entrepreneurial plaintiffs firm might try to make some cash on you by soliciting some clients, taking a shot, and seeing if they can get their time paid back.
Keep in mind that in modern RICO cases we're not talking about Sammy the Bull breaking kneecaps. We're talking about run-of-the-mill business or consumer torts. And while in your mind you might be thinking, "What do I care if BP or whoever has to pay more damages, fuck 'em," anyone might be subject to a lawsuit; every day, big businesses, small businesses, bad people, good people, and okay people find themselves on the business end of a civil complaint.
What's maddening here is that plaintiffs might get a triple payout not because they proved the defendant was three times as bad or did something three times worse, but because they were able to check the boxes on a cause of action created by statute: returning to subsection (c) above, if you can show the defendant was employed/associated with an “enterprise,” and that the defendant “conducted” this enterprise “through a pattern of racketeering activity,” you've pled a RICO claim and you're in the money.
The “pattern of racketeering” element is relatively easy to satisfy. Two of the crimes defined as “racketeering activity” are federal mail fraud and wire fraud, which criminalize using the the mail or wires (i.e., TV, phones, Internet) “for the purpose of executing [a] scheme or artifice [to defraud].” If you're accusing someone of something in 2016, it's pretty likely they used a phone or an email at some point in the course of things, and it's pretty likely they did so twice, some time apart. But if not, there's a host of other transgressions to choose from.
As for the remaining question -- did the defendant “conduct” a “enterprise”? -- these arguments might not be as straightforward as what you imagine from the plain English definitions of the words. To “conduct” an enterprise does not mean be the boss, but rather requires only that you “participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself,” with some degree of direction over the affairs of the enterprise. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993). This includes “lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management.” Id. Courts have said that low-level operators could conduct an enterprise by “knowingly implementing decisions, as well as by making them." United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 750 (1st Cir. 1994). You don't need to prove that the defendant's running the show, showing he's the prop manager is fine.
Regarding the existence, an “enterprise," here things have gotten their most vague. Over time, the meaning of the term “enterprise” drifted away from the original conception of an established organization to become simply “a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose." Boyle v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 2237 (2009). All an enterprise needs to exist is (1) "a purpose," (2) "relationships among those associated with the enterprise," and (3) "longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.” Id.
As you can imagine, this broad, definition has led to “enterprises” being found in some decidedly non-mafia situations. As The Economist wrote last year, recent civil RICO suits have spanned
from cases against firms involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, or in hiring immigrant labor (brought by domestic workers alleging immigration fraud that threatens their jobs and amounts to racketeering), to a case in which a group of Atlanta teachers and school administrators received sentences of up to seven years for test-score manipulation. Sheldon Whitehouse, a U.S. senator, has suggested using RICO to charge fossil-fuel companies and climate-change deniers, on the ground that they are engaged in a conspiracy of lies. If that seems a stretch, RICO has been used against senior Catholic clergymen over sex abuse committed by their priests.
"Business and Law: Taking the Gangster Rap," The Economist (Aug. 7, 2015)
For example, in Odom v. Microsoft Corp., 486 F. 3d 541 (9th Cir. 2007), the court found the plaintiffs could plead a RICO “enterprise” where Microsoft and Best Buy launched a joint a marketing program, through which customers at Best Buy were automatically enrolled into a recurring MSN account. Just that marketing agreement, and the interactions between the two companies, was an "enterprise" under the law.
Think about that for a second. The finding of whether an an “enterprise” existed turned on a handful of facts, such as that the defendants had an “ongoing organization” because they set up a computer system to automatically transmit consumers' contact information for enrollment. At the core, this does not make sense to me: auto-enrollment is a shitty business practice, and an example of unfair competition, but should Microsoft and Best Buy face triple liability because they set up a persistent transmittal link rather than proceeding ad hoc? It's a fact that's orthogonal to the harm the actually did.
The RICO Act has drifted too far from its moorings. It was a law intended to catch gangsters, and it's become a booby prize to be chased after for settlement leverage, tripling damages because of the existence of factors that are only tangentially related to the level of the wrong or the depth of the harm. It's time for a revision.
Illinois nuclear reactor expels radioactive steam
By Marcus Day
6 February 2012
A nuclear reactor in Byron, Illinois, about 95 miles northwest of Chicago, released radioactive steam into the environment after an unexpected shutdown Monday morning. The steam was deliberately released by plant operators in an effort to prevent equipment at the reactor from overheating. Additionally, smoke was spotted rising from a station transformer at the plant itself. However, a fire crew called to the scene was unable to determine its source and whether or not it was caused by a fire. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission declared the incident an “unusual event,” the first of four stages of nuclear emergency.
The Exelon Corporation, which runs the Byron Nuclear Generating Station, claims the reactor lost power after a line insulator failed at an electrical switchyard dozens of miles away from the plant itself. The reactor's equipment continued to run on diesel power for four days, at which point workers were able to replace the malfunctioning insulator.
The steam released from the plant contained tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Although tritium is too weak to penetrate the skin, it can be dangerous if touched, inhaled, or ingested via food or water.
While officials claim that the amount of radioactive material expelled was “minimal” and poses no immediate health risks, they have been unable to determine exactly how much tritium was released in the steam. Tritium molecules are small enough that they are able to pass from tubing in the reactor itself into the water, which is used to cool equipment outside the reactor. It was from this area of the plant, where the turbines normally operate, that the steam was released, in order to reduce pressure and cool the inactive equipment.
Exelon, based in Chicago, is the largest utility holding company and operates the second largest number of nuclear reactors in the US. This is by no means the first time operators at an Exelon plant have deliberately released radioactive steam in order to cool a reactor. Another of Exelon's reactors in Braidwood, Illinois, 50 miles southwest of Chicago, expelled tritium steam in 2010. Moreover, in 2006, it was revealed that both the company and state officials had waited years before publicly revealing that this plant had spilled millions of gallons of water, also containing tritium.
The “unusual event” at Byron was not the only radioactive leak at an American plant this week: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) also reported a “minor” release of radioactive material at a reactor in San Onofre, California. The origin of this leak remains undetermined.
An investigation by the Associated Press last year revealed that there have been tritium leaks at least at 48 of 65 nuclear energy production sites in the United States. Many of these leaks have found their way into the groundwater via damaged and neglected piping. In fact, two of these previous leaks were documented as contaminating the drinking wells of homes in Illinois, though not at levels exceeding the NRC's limits for safe drinking water. It is important to note, however, that the American standard for “safe” amounts of tritium in drinking water is nearly eight times that of the European Union.
Even though the frequency and severity of leaks and equipment failures have been increasing over recent decades, as pipes and other equipment fall into ever-greater disrepair, the federal agency charged with regulating the industry has significantly increased the number of licenses, which they have extended for plants. As of 2011, at least 60 percent of nuclear plants have received 20-year extensions on their 40-year operating licenses.
The Obama administration, despite its professions of concern for environmental safety, maintains an incestuous relationship with Exelon. Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Obama's former chief of staff, helped play a critical role in the merger that formed Exelon in 1999. David Axelrod, until recently Obama's senior advisor, was a communications consultant to the company. In addition to top executives at the corporation having raised significant funds for several of Obama's political campaigns, officials from Obama's energy department have left their posts for lucrative positions at the company.
The incidents at Byron and San Onofre come less than a year after an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, knocking out power and backup cooling systems at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, triggering meltdowns at three of the plant's six reactors, and eventually leading to one of the worst nuclear disasters in history, second perhaps only to Chernobyl.
Officials at the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which ran the plant, delayed taking critical measures to prevent the reactor from overheating out of concern that they would present considerable expenses to the company in the future. Both TEPCO officials and members of the Japanese government consciously played down the extent of damage to the plant and the health risks facing those living nearby. Even though TEPCO had a long history of cover-ups and safety violations, they were allowed by the Japanese government to remain in control of trying to manage the disaster. Nearly 100,000 people have been forced to flee their homes because of widespread nuclear contamination, and traces of radioactivity continue to turn up in food in Japan's major cities.
Even though TEPCO officials claim they have managed to force the damaged reactors into a state of “cold shutdown,” there is evidence that the plant continues to expel radioactive material. Just this week, it was discovered that a dislodged pipe allowed 8.5 tons of radioactive water to leak from the plant. Nuclear experts remain concerned about the structural integrity of the pool in which spent fuel is kept; if this pool were to collapse, it could produce a catastrophe worse than the meltdowns of the plant's three reactors.
After the disaster at Fukushima, even though there was widespread concern internationally about the safety of nuclear power plants, Obama officials maintained that existing safety regulations were satisfactory and refused to seriously re-evaluate the aggressive plan for expansion of the domestic nuclear industry.
In March 2011, a day after hydrogen explosions erupted at Fukushima's damaged reactors, US energy secretary Stephen Chu went before a congressional subcommittee to claim that “The American people should have full confidence that the United States has rigorous safety regulations in place to ensure that our nuclear power is generated safely and responsibly” and that “the administration is committed to learning from Japan's experience as we work to continue to strengthen America's nuclear industry to reevaluate domestic nuclear industry.”
Clearly, as the continual near misses and “minor” accidents at American nuclear facilities reveal, the administration is in fact committed to nothing but the defense of the nuclear industry's profit interests. While these companies remain under private ownership, the health and safety of both the population and the environment will remain, at best, an afterthought.
The reason why the music cuts out is because of the piranha plant nearby. Normally when you walk close to a sleeping piranha plant, the music fades out, and the lullaby music plays instead. When Mario walks far enough away, the music turns back to normal.
The reason that the music fades out completely for cannonless is because of the downwarp after collecting the star. When Mario grabs the ledge to collect the star, they are still in range of the sleeping piranha plant's lullaby. After the downwarp the game recognizes Mario significantly out of range of the piranha plant, so the game cuts off the lullaby at the same time that it would normally start playing the music for the course. Due to this, any music that tries to load is cutoff, and we can only hear Mario speaking.
To verify, try killing the piranha plant then doing the cannonless setup vs just doing the cannonless setup when leaving it alive. The music will only cut off when the piranha plant is alive.
SM64 is actually pretty stable in the crashing regard. As far as I'm aware, there's only one specific reproducible crash due to a null read when looking for sound. This is the infamous sound glitch in SSL, where the game essentially tries to play too many sounds at once, glitches out, and stops playing any sound at all. This sound glitch was patched out in the US release anyways, and is only possible on the J 1.0 release of SM64.
If you want to know the answer to similar questions to this one, I'd recommend checking out the SM64 TASing Discord where people analyze and TAS the game.
Wasmannia auropunctata, also known as little fire ants. Hawaii Department of Agriculture
HONOLULU — Wearing camouflage fatigues and heavy combat boots, Aaron Works, Kari Bogner and Tehere Gibbs march through the quiet, upscale Honolulu neighborhood of Mililani Mauka. It is a hot Monday in July, and the sun throws hard shadows on the manicured lawns. The trio is heading for a densely forested gulch just beyond a row of houses, where they will spend several hours laying down little plastic vials marked with miniature red flags and smeared with peanut butter meant to entice tiny ginger invaders. Though the combat gear is just their standard field-work uniform, the three really are at war: They are working to eradicate one of the island state's most dreaded and tiniest enemies, Wasmannia auropunctata, also known as the little fire ant for its diminutive size and fiery sting. Originally from South America, the little fire ant ranks among the world's 100 worst invasive species due to the ease with which it travels and the threat it poses to human and animal health, tourism, agriculture, horticulture and tropical ecosystems. Not only does its sting leave humans with angry, itchy welts for days, it is also known to blind mammals; attack ground nesting seabirds, small lizards and turtles; eliminate many other species of invertebrates and spiders in its range; and promote the growth of debilitating plant pests such as scales and aphids. Over the past three decades, little fire ants have spread throughout the Pacific region and have badly infested parts of Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, northern Australia and the Galápagos Islands. Easily transported by human commerce, they are capable of stowing away in almost anything — cargo, baggage, building materials, cars, potted plants and produce. Wasmannia auropunctata is just one of roughly 40 invasive species that afflict the Hawaii islands; the onslaught of invasive species in the island state contributes to more endangered species per square mile here than anywhere else in the world. But the little fire ant has an impact disproportionate to its size.
‘Pruning the trees, picking the fruit, becomes really difficult. The workers get stung, hundreds of stings a day.' Casper Vanderwoude manager, Hawaii Ant Lab
If Hawaii doesn't step up its efforts to combat the ants, according to University of Hawaii estimates, over the next 10 years, individuals and businesses on the Big Island will have to bear losses of $140 million, spend $1.2 billion on mitigation and treatment and suffer 390 million stings. “It doesn't just affect one segment of society; it affects all segments of society,” said Casper Vanderwoude, the ant man of Hawaii. They run the Hawaii Ant Lab in Hilo, on the Big Island, which is dedicated to eradicating little fire ants. They give monthly “ant-killing 101” workshops that are habitually oversubscribed, and they taught Works, Bogner and Gibbs everything they know about tracking the critters. Vanderwoude estimates that around a third of the houses in Hilo are infested. Residents have complained of stings from ants in their couches, beds and kitchens. Perhaps worst of all for Hawaii's economy, little fire ants threaten to spoil this tropical paradise for tourists, who account for close to a quarter of the island state's economy. In recent months, visitors at a number of beaches have reported getting stung by ants falling out of trees and swarming under them in the grass. One beach park has been shuttered for surveying and treatment. The ants have already hurt agricultural and horticultural businesses. “Pruning the trees, picking the fruit, becomes really difficult,” said Vanderwoude. “The workers get stung, hundreds of stings a day — and infested product can't be exported because it's a quarantine pest.” Some Hawaiian farmers have had trouble hanging on to workers who pick fruit and flowers. A few have even abandoned badly infested farms. And both farmers and nursery owners have had ant-infested product rejected and sent back by inspectors from the mainland. “Everyone is having a hard time killing them,” said one tropical fruit-farmer with a nine-acre organic farm on the eastern coast of the Big Island as they stood surveying a swarm of the tiny ginger insects under a dry leaf on a banana tree. They didn't want to be named for fear of hurting their sales. Though the farmer has been treating the single infested acre every four to six weeks with a special gel bait concocted by Vanderwoude, the ants have not yet retreated. They and their husband wear protective clothing, but get stung several times a day. Ants have swarmed a few of their beehives, and their cows won't go to pasture in the infested acre. They pointed out the ghostly film over the eyes of their border collies, working dogs. Many residents and farmers in this part of the Big Island have watched their pets go blind, their corneas slowly clouding over, which scientists have found to be highly correlated with the presence of little fire ants. “I'm not the one who brought them here,” they said. “Why is the farmer having to foot the bill?”
‘Where it's infested, these ants just tend to fall out of the trees. It's a continual rain of ants on people and animals.' Vanderwoude
Banana trees in Hawaii, where little fire ants like to nest. Age fotostock / Alamy Measuring just one-sixteenth of an inch, about the thickness of a penny, the little fire ant is little indeed, and this is part of the problem. Entire colonies can hide in the folds of a single leaf or a macadamia-nut shell. This means they can easily go undetected as they hitch rides from one place to another, even as their colonies grow to unmanageable proportions. Unlike most other pest ants, they also nest in trees, and each colony has multiple queens, allowing the ants to build supercolonies that span thousands of acres on the ground and into tree canopies, with up to 80 million ants per acre. Because they like wet, shady habitats, they are especially suited to Hawaii's rainforests. “Where it's infested, these ants just tend to fall out of the trees. It's a continual rain of ants on people and animals,” said Vanderwoude, “because they're arboreal, but they're not very good at staying up there.” Brush up against the trunk, whack at the tree with a machete or shake the branches when picking fruit or coffee and one can be showered with hundreds of ants. They won't sting unless threatened, but are easily caught in shirts and waistbands. And when one ant bites, it emits an alarm pheromone, which causes other little fire ants in the vicinity to bite in unison. The presence of little fire ants was first reported in Hawaii in 1999, in the rainy, agricultural southeastern corner of the Big Island. Scientists suspect the ants came over from Florida in potted plants. Despite early efforts by the state Department of Agriculture to contain them, they are now so widespread on the Big Island that most conservationists say they will be impossible to eradicate. By contrast, smaller infestations on Kauai and Maui have so far been kept in check, and no ants had been reported on Oahu — until December. The Mililani Mauka infestation, which Works, Bogner and Gibbs are mapping, came to light in June and was the second to be reported on Oahu. The first was discovered just a few days before Christmas last year and traced back to the Honolulu neighborhood of Waimanalo, where a number of plant nurseries are located. The ants had apparently hitched a ride from the Big Island, lodging themselves in the porous trunks of native hapu'u ferns, according to entomologists at the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. The ferns are often used as nursery logs for orchids and other plants, and more than 1,000 had been shipped to nurseries in Oahu and Maui. Though a treatment program was immediately launched, the fear is that the unrecovered hapu'u logs — the agriculture department was able to recover about 600 — will spread the ants all over Oahu. The ant scare, coupled with near-daily stories in the media, led legislators to quickly roll out several bills targeted at controlling little fire ants and invasive species in general. One would have established biosecurity facilities at Hawaii's airports and ports; another would have fined individuals found responsible for moving the ants from one island to another. Ultimately, none of the proposed legislation passed, in part due to pressure from the farm and nursery industries. But the statewide Hawaii Invasive Species Council got a record $5 million in appropriations funding for its upcoming budget, more than five times what it received last year.
A lab bait test for Hawaii's little fire ants. Kristen French Conservationists say invasive species such as the little fire ants will continue to spread without better regulation similar to what island nations like New Zealand and Australia have put in place. New Zealand, for instance, goes so far as to require inspection and treatment of mud on all sports gear, camping equipment and hiking boots entering the country. Meanwhile the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires luggage bound from Hawaii to the mainland to be X-rayed, which can catch undeclared agricultural goods; yet Hawaii, which is much more vulnerable to invasive species, does not require similar inspections of luggage coming into the state. Here, agricultural enterprises aren't even required to register with regulatory agencies, which makes it harder to control and communicate with them when there is an outbreak. Further, a nursery can ship anything interisland without inspection by the Department of Agriculture as long as the nursery is certified — but the certification process only happens a few times a year and applies to just a few pests; typically, inspectors only test the designated areas. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture doesn't have the authority to require inspection of any nonpropagative material — a category that includes everything from hapu'u logs, tropical fruits, vegetables and cut flowers to cars, boats and building materials — all perfect hiding places for a little fire ant. Rob Curtiss, an entomologist with the plant pest control branch of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture and the “incident commander” for the state's interagency program to control the little fire ant, said the department is working to draft voluntary compliance agreements for businesses that ship interisland. But those rules will do nothing to prevent the continued spread of little fire ants around the Big Island, as happened a few years ago when the ants moved from the rainy eastern side to the sunnier, more touristy western side, infesting coffee farms.

NEWS BRIEF Some of the best female chess players in the world are calling for a boycott of next year's world championship being held in Iran, protesting the mandatory use of the hijab. But one Iranian grandmaster is pleading for those chess players to reconsider.
Mitra Hejazipour, the winner of the 2015 Asian continental women's championship, said a boycott could set back efforts to promote female participation in sports in Iran. They told The Guardian on Friday:
This is going to be the biggest sporting event women in Iran have ever seen; we haven't been able to host any world championship in other sporting fields for women in the past. It's not right to call for a boycott. These games are important for women in Iran; it's an opportunity for us to show our strength.
The move, they say, would isolate Iran and ignore progress that Iranian women have made in the country.
Other top chess players are remaining firm on their boycott threat, saying the headscarf is a symbol of oppression for women. Nazi Paikidze-Barnes, the American champion, told CNN:
If the venue of the championship is not changed, I will not be participating. I am deeply upset by this. I feel privileged to have qualified to represent the US at the Women's World Chess Championship and to not be able to due to religious, sexist, and political issues is very disappointing.
The hijab has been an Iranian policy since the 1979 revolution, which brought strict religious laws to public life.
Buckingham Palace on Friday denied allegations by a woman who said in Florida court documents that they were forced as a minor to have sex with Britain's Prince Andrew and other high-profile figures linked to a wealthy US business person.
The woman, in legal papers filed this week in the US Southern District of Florida, said financier Jeffrey Epstein made them have sex with the Duke of York in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island, as part of “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls,”according to the filings. “Epstein instructed them that they were to give the Prince whatever they demanded and required to report back to them on the details of the sexual abuse,” the documents said.
Them accusations came as part of an ongoing civil case brought against the US government by several women who say they were abused by Epstein, who served jail time on state child sex charges but was not prosecuted in federal court as part of a plea agreement. The accuser is seeking to join litigation dating back to 2008, in which several women who say they were victimized by Epstein claim that federal prosecutors violated their rights as crime victims.

INDIAN HEAD, Md. (WBFF) -- Brandon Paulin still lives at home, still has braces, and still goes to class. Paulin, 19, is also the mayor of Indian Head, Md., a Charles County town of 4,000 in Washington D.C.'s southern suburbs.
"It's a nice title to have, you know, 'Youngest Mayor,' but it doesn't really change what I want to do or anything," Mayor Paulin said. "I mean, always be the jokes, 'Oh, we've gotta wrap up the meeting. It's the mayor's bedtime.' You know, you always get the jokes, but, overall, when we're talking business, it's strictly Indian Head and how we're gonna move it forward."
Paulin was elected in May with 239 votes.  They are a political science major at the College of Southern Maryland. Thursday, five months into their tenure, they showed FOX45 town projects for which they worked: a playground rebuilt on the town's east end and a building demolition planned for the town's west end, near the U.S. Naval Ordnance Station.
Other elected officials say Paulin is beyond their years.
"Once you engage with Brandon, you get past their age very quickly. He's very polished," Charles County Commissioner Ken Robinson said. "Once we're in meetings, you forget that he's 19."
Hundreds arrested in crime crackdown

Police say the intensity of the violence and the number of attacks on police are the biggest concern after the first night of a national operation targeting alcohol-fuelled violence.
Almost 500 people have been arrested around the country since Operation Unite began on Friday night.
New South Wales police arrested 251 people - 27 of those allegedly assaulted police, leaving one officer with a broken nose.
"The purpose of this operation is to ram home the message that police and the wider community have had enough of alcohol-related violence," operation commander Assistant Commissioner Denis Clifford said.
In Queensland more than 400 officers were out in force arresting 137 people, including one man in Mackay who has been charged for allegedly biting a police officer.
Police in Victoria arrested 44 people - 39 for drunkenness and five for assault.
Police in Western Australia charged 227 people with a total of 245 offences, including assault, disorderly behaviour and drug possession.
WA Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan says officers will take a zero tolerance approach in the national operation over the weekend.
"We've seen an intensity in the level of assaults happening on the streets," they said.
"We've seen one-punch assaults, we've seen glassings and a whole range of things that concern us.
"This is a way of sending a very strong message to the community that it is unacceptable."
Fourteen arrests were made in South Australia, while in Tasmania nine people were arrested, mainly for drink driving.
Five were arrested in the ACT. Figures for the first night of the operation in the Northern Territory have not been released.
Operation Unite has been held three times over the past two years and police expect another will be conducted in December.
Across Australia and New Zealand there were about 2,617 arrests during the December 2010 operation.

mgmegadog asked: While I can understand why you wouldn't want to share your data, you must realize that the reason we want it is because there have been numerous examples of misusing data recently; the perception that Copy-Cat was going to be fine, Sam Stoddard's post where they stated that they received a positive response about how people felt about something (standard?) when the poll showed overwhelming negative opinion, etc. With that in mind, why would we NOT doubt the conclusions you've been reaching?
The Copy-Cat decision came from us being nervous about banning another card, not from us misrepresenting data.
Sam's column came about because Sam looked at the early responses and assumed later data would be similar when it, in fact, it got worse. Sam never intended to misrepresent data. Note that data was public so misrepresenting it on purpose would have just been foolish. Sam, by the way, apologized for that incident.
We have been a transparent company since the earliest days. I talk to you all openly on a daily basis. There's no great business reason here for us to lie to you on this current batch of data. If there was a correlation between promo cards and attendance, we'd be doing promo cards. There's no business reason to not do things that work.
The bigger issue is you can assume we're lying all the time and never have an open communication with us, or you can assume that we're actually telling the truth and talk with us about how you feel.
You're pressuring me to give you private business data, I can't make public, doesn't do anything but make things adversarial for no gain.
You want to know why we're doing something, ask me. I'll talk as openly and honestly about it as I'm allowed.
But please, have the courtesy to assume I'm not lying to you.

Human development is a personal matter; where each child grows on their own personal manner. Each child should be permitted to grow at his/her own rate. We see the same thing all throughout nature. Flowers don't all bloom at the same time and fruits in a bunch don't ripen altogether either. Hence, why insist our children to all grow the same way?
In as much as development is a systematic and orderly change where our children experience a gain or loss in abilities as they live; there is no way that all development is the same.
Of course, there have always been principles by which we have observed development to move along. We can observe that development follows a sense of continuity. It does not end until we have laid our last breath. It is sequential, following a pattern of movement, phases and stages. We first learn to stand before we walk. Child doodles dashes and lines before they scribble a circular shape then they progress to drawing angled shapes like squares. Patterns of development appear common on each stage or phase. It also moves from generality to specificity. Babies inside the womb manage to move their body, usually randomly and instinctively before they are able to move their arms and move their fingers. Children will be able to raise their arms before they can hold a pencil correctly. Furthermore, development proceeds from the head downward which goes to explain why babies have bigger heads; then, eventually moving into a more symmetrical body. It also proceeds from the centre of the body moving to our extremities.
The first time Jean Charest met Elsie Wayne, it wasn't under the greatest of circumstances.
The Progressive Conservative Party had experienced a devastating defeat in the 1993 federal election. Former MP and Quebec premier Charest and Wayne were the only two Tories elected to the House of Commons.
That story was one of many Charest shared in their eulogy at Wayne's funeral on Saturday morning at the RiverCross Church in Saint John on Saturday. Wayne died at their home on Tuesday at the age of 84.
Among those in attendance were former premiers Bernard Lord and Frank MacKenna, former MP Peter MacKay and Senator Mike Duffy.
Tory stalwart
Jean Charest, former MP and Quebec premier, eulogized Elsie Wayne on Saturday at their funeral in Saint John, N.B. (CBC)
"It was like being in charge of a train wreck. Both of us were shell-shocked," Charest said, referring to that two-person caucus in 1993. "In that meeting, Elsie looked at me in the eyes and said — 'Well, I guess it's up to you and me, Jean,'" said Charest before a packed church."It was like being in charge of a train wreck. Both of us were shell-shocked," Charest said, referring to that two-person caucus in 1993.
Wayne was born in New Brunswick on April 20, 1932. Prior to entering federal politics in 1993, Wayne was a popular Saint John municipal councillor and in 1983, became mayor. Them last year in federal politics was 2004.
Never gave up a fight
Charest spoke fondly of their former colleague, noting that they were known in Canada by their first name. This recognition, Charest said, is "quite a compliment" in political life.
They added that Wayne had a tireless work ethic and never gave up a fight until the answer was "yes." Charest recounted several battles Wayne had on Parliament Hill, including ones involving employment insurance and veterans affairs.
"I was a witness to the battle that they undertook on the behalf of World War Two Canadian veterans of the merchant marine," they said. "She was successful in convincing the government to provide them with benefits and increased compensation."
'Nothing ordinary about Elsie'
"I would learn, as their people in Saint John knew so well, that the heavens had sent me as a partner, and as a companion, the all-time Canadian champion of lost causes," Charest said.
"There was nothing ordinary about Elsie. Nothing."
Stephen Wayne, Wayne's son, said they were overwhelmed with the turnout Saturday.
"It was a perfect sendoff for my mom. And I know that she's in heaven now and smiling down," they said.
"It's gonna be hard, but God love her, they were beautiful."
It took several tries, but on Tuesday the U.S. Senate approved a measure to help American companies work more closely with law enforcement to fight off hackers.
The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) overwhelmingly passed with a vote of 74 to 21.
Tech companies were suspicious of the bill, but worries that hackers are continuously breaking into companies trumped fears that CISA would expand U.S. government spying on Americans.
CISA must now be merged with two similar bills that have already passed in the House of Representatives before it heads to President Obama's desk.
The idea behind CISA is to help U.S. companies react more quickly to cyberattacks on their computer systems. If a company gets hit with a specific type of hack, the federal government would receive an alert and immediately distribute warnings to other companies.
Every cyberattack is like a flu virus, and CISA is intended to be a lightning-fast distribution system for the flu vaccine. Opt in, and you get a government shot in minutes, not months.
Currently, industries maintain specialized, military-like "information sharing and analysis centers" to track cyberattacks and collectively develop defenses. Banking has its ISAC. The energy sector has its own too. But they don't team up.

With CISA, a power plant might learn how to defend itself from a virus that hit a bank -- within minutes. All of this is supposed to happen automatically, with computer servers sending constant updates to other computer servers.
CISA would create a single system that sends "cyber threat indicators" -- such as samples of malicious computer code -- to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS would then feed this data to the FBI, NSA and other government agencies. DHS would also share warnings to every participating American company.
Computer scientists and military experts agree that automatic, immediate sharing helps the nation raise its defenses.
A significant element of the bill is that CISA would eliminate liability for companies, making them immune to lawsuits for sharing too much. Banking, energy, health care, insurance -- almost every industry but tech supported the bill.
Several efforts to include additional privacy measures were shot down in the Senate.

However, there are worries that companies in a hurry might not wipe the data enough before law enforcement gets it, expanding how many authorities and spies know about Americans. There's also concern that this bill gives the FBI another tool to investigate Americans for crimes that have nothing to do with hacking.
To address those concerns, CISA includes privacy guards to ensure that companies wipe customer data before handing it to the government. The bill also subjects government agencies to biannual reviews to make sure that civil liberties will not be violated.
Randy V. Sabett is a former NSA cryptography engineer who sat on a cybersecurity committee for the nation's president that raised these issues in 2008. They said this an opportunity for America to step up its game against hackers.

"This bill doesn't do anything except help us defend our companies better," said Sabett, now an attorney the Cooley firm in Washington, D.C.
U.S. government agencies and corporations have come under attack in recent years by hackers from the Chinese, Iranian, Russian governments.
CISA, however, scares privacy advocates who fear companies getting too cozy with law enforcement.
The Obama administration supports CISA overall, and succeeded in pushing for privacy measures to be included in the bill. But just last week, it expressed concerns that CISA would still let too much information be shared with spy agencies and the military.
Some hacking experts say CISA is, in principle, a good idea, but does little to address the actual problem: Companies are lazy and unguarded, and most people don't know how to act safely online.
"CISA will do very little, if anything, to protect our national cyber-security interests," said Ben Johnson, a former NSA analyst who now works with cybersecurity firm Bit9.
Ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who exposed widespread spying on Americans and remains in hiding in Russia, criticized CISA. They said the FBI and NSA already collect this kind of hacking data all over the Internet -- but CISA would allow them to collect even more directly from companies.
Laying the Foundation for Social Action
by Ajahn Pasanno* Adapted from a talk given at Fort Bragg, CA, March 23, 1998.
Originally published in Fearless Mountain, Spring, 1999, pp. 1, 4-5.
What we bring to the society around us are simply our own qualities of mind, of heart, of being-our intentions and how they manifest in our actions. In order to understand our effects on society, we first have to understand ourselves, to see these qualities more clearly. The ability we have to help others, or to do anything to affect others, is dependent upon the clarity, intention, and integrity with which we live our lives. These things are inseparable. As such, the way we train ourselves is equally important to any actions we take outside ourselves.
In Buddhist practice, the training laid out for an individual begins with how one practices with others. This is sila, or virtue-not harming others, being honest in the way one deals with others, being trustworthy in one's actions and speech. The practice of keeping the precepts is already social action. The precepts remind us of the ways our actions affect others. Oftentimes, people may think, Let's get to the "real" stuff about Buddhism-the liberation, the enlightenment; keeping the precepts is just a social convention, just the basics. But this "basic" stuff has an effect. It is important. The Buddha recognized that our actions have effects for ourselves and for others.
While virtue concerns itself with actions and speech, the second aspect of the Buddhist training is meditation, or samadhi-a training of the mind and the heart, a clarifying of mindfulness, awareness, and composure. These are essential to cultivate. If we are going to take any social responsibility, it has to be done with an open heart and a clear mind. We must develop a standard for reflection. We can then start to ask, what are the effects of our words and actions? Sometimes people get enthused about social action and forget about the ordinary activities in life. How do I deal with my family? How do I deal with the people closest to me? Or even how do I answer the phone? What do I put into the universe when I am irritated or upset? These are very ordinary, everyday things, preparing the ground for how we relate to the world around us. Paying attention to these things is social action. Dealing with the circle of people around us is social action. It is not different.
From a Buddhist perspective, the next step is recognizing the quality of wisdom, or pañña. There are many different levels of wisdom, but seeing things as they truly are is its essence. With a reflective ability of the mind, we can begin to see things as they truly are and start to turn towards that. This is not simply gathering new bits of knowledge or being zapped with some sort of enlightened energy. It is a turning inward to be able to open to all the ways things truly are and allowing our lives to be guided by that wisdom. How does this affect myself? How does this affect others? What is the way to freedom and liberation? What is the way out of suffering and dissatisfaction for myself and for others? Wisdom is seeing the different ways we entangle ourselves in things and the different ways we can be free.
Virtue, meditation, and wisdom are the tools we use in training ourselves in how to relate to the world around us. This training will help us to see the qualities that bring true benefit to our society-the qualities of loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. These are the Brahma viharas, or divine abodes. In a way, these can be considered a goal of social action: creating a way in which human beings should live. Loving kindness is the wish for another's happiness; compassion is the wish to alleviate another's suffering. Sympathetic joy is the happiness we feel in the success of another. And equanimity is the ability to stay centered in the midst of life's ups and downs.
The quality of sympathetic joy is an interesting one in terms of social action. Its opposite is jealousy or envy. In many ways, envy is the foundation for competition and conflict. If a society is based upon competitive accumulation-like some societies we know-it can create conflict and a lack of appreciation and willingness to enjoy each other. Having come to the United States after living in Thailand for twenty-three years, the sense of competition here is very striking. In Thailand, there is a wide stratification in terms of socio-economic level and opportunity within society, but there is not a lot of envy or competition. People are often motivated to improve their economic lot, but they don't resent those who already have wealth or privilege. Similarly, there is usually not a looking down on or shunning of those in economic difficulty or from a poor background. There is an acceptance that people have accumulated different tendencies and have different abilities.
This acceptance has imbued people's consciousness. It is a sense of karma playing a role in people's lives over many lifetimes, a feeling of "who knows?" This lifetime can change; in other lifetimes it might be different. Rebirth is an accepted part of how they perceive the world - it's a long view on life. This takes away the edge of selfishness and competitiveness and brings a sense of appreciation for each other as human beings, a joy in each other's happiness. By turning toward this quality of joy, we can draw on our wish to help others, to be of service.
Acceptance also brings the quality of equanimity, a non-reactive clarity that allows one to stay centered. Equanimity is not indifference. It is the ability to return to a place of stillness, to be non-reactive, and to weigh things carefully. This is an important quality especially when considering social action or social responsibility. Without equanimity, we can get drawn into our own reactiveness-our views and opinions. We can think that we're always right, that other people are just a bunch of idiots. It's easy to get turned around and out of balance. Not being drawn into the web of our views and opinions but being able to settle and reflect-to ask, what is the way of balance?-equanimity is essential in undertaking social action.
* * *
In the social action projects I have been involved in, the Buddhist perspective has taught me some important things. Take a particular project, like protecting the forests. The monastery in Thailand at which I was abbot was quite well-known, with a large community of monks, novices, lay men, and lay women practicing and training there. I thought it would provide a good balance to set up a more remote branch monastery. Our new location was right along the Mekong River. It was in one of the last forests in the province, and around that time, the area was made into a national park. But this was just a designation on the map, and it caused a lot of problems. The area was full of stumps. It was being logged, and many villagers had made their fields there.
The Buddhist perspective was very helpful. We couldn't simply say, "These are awful, nasty people. The planet would be a fine sort of place if they weren't doing this." The reality was that they are doing this and that they are people just like us. They are trying to look after their families and to get ahead in the world. In order to do anything to protect the forest, we had to find ways to include them. How do you involve the people who are cutting down the forest? How do you include the merchants who are paying them? How do you include the civil servants who are taking the bribes to allow the cutting?
The teachings told us that problems come from people not understanding how they are creating suffering for themselves and for others. Problems and suffering come from desires and attachments. You can't simply wish that away. You've got to work on the basic problems of bringing knowledge and education into their lives. Why were they cutting down the forest? Of course, they wanted to live comfortably, to look after their families. So, we had to find ways to provide for them. Otherwise, it would be like trying to build a wall to stop the tide from coming in. Good luck! It's going to find a way. Instead, you have to think clearly and find ways to address peoples' needs, to include them and bring them in. This takes time.
This understanding reflects our own personal spiritual practice. We'd all like to sit down, cross our legs, close our eyes, and become enlightened-just like that. Instead, we have to take the time to lay a foundation, to become patient and clear enough to develop the path in a comprehensive way. Just as the Buddha taught us the Four Noble Truths as the basis for our own practice-suffering, the causes of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering-the same applies to social action. We've got suffering, we've got a problem. What are all the different causes of that problem? What kind of end can there be to that problem? If we haven't understood the problem, we won't be able to see the causes. And if we aren't really clear about the goal we are working towards, we won't really know what kinds of path to develop. It works in society the same way it works in our own practice. The more we reflect on and practice with those truths for ourselves, the more we are able to apply them in our life, in very ordinary situations, with our friends, with our family, at work, with different problems happening in the community. That is social action.
How can we work together to do this? With our project along the Mekong, we began by drawing in people affiliated with the monastery who were interested in helping. In a Buddhist society, the monastery is a foundation we could build on, a field for social action. Because the monastery is dependent on lay people to support it, there is a day-to-day connection with the neighboring society. It is a web of support and interaction, so that when there is a problem in the community, we can easily recognize who is interested in helping. At first there were a few volunteers. When there was too much work for volunteers to do, we hired some people. Again, the money for their salaries came from offerings to the monastery from people in the community.
The forest project continued to grow. We even drew in people like the police. They had power, especially when it came to controlling who was taking logs out. Rather than getting into a confrontation with them, we asked how we could work with them. That was very easy at the time because one of the supporters of the monastery was the Deputy Superintendent of Police. They were a great resource for drawing in other honest police officers, who then had a few words with even more police officers and got them on our side. This takes time, it takes patience, it takes clarity. If you work in a confrontational way, it's difficult to achieve this. By having a strong focus on one's personal practice and integrity, by becoming more clear, centered, and pure-hearted in one's intention for doing good, the more one starts to connect with other people. In terms of social action, this seems to be a magnet, drawing other good people. It gets its own momentum going. So far, the forest project is working. And besides being successful in its own right, it has been adopted as a model for trial projects in other national parks in Thailand.
During one of the recent elections in Thailand, I saw a handwritten sign on the side of a building. It said something like, "The forces of corruption are given more power when good people retreat." The "system" gains more momentum when we decide we don't want to deal with it, that things are hopeless. With social action work, we have to be patient, discerning, equanimous. We have to be willing to try and to fail. We have to recognize that sometimes things will work and sometimes they won't. And that they always work out in ways we may never have conceived. This is the same as returning to the foundation of one's own practice: keeping the precepts; developing clarity, tranquillity, and peace of mind; establishing wisdom through reflective investigation; cultivating the qualities of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. These form the foundation that allows us to move out into the realm of social action.
Version 1.3.1d
Reduced the life of Mirror Arrow and Blink Arrow clones by around 80%. The clones now take 80% less damage to match their previous survivability. The clones originally had their life set higher than normal for survivability reasons. The Minion Instability keystone passive took advantage of this large amount of life and lead to an unreasonably powerful skill combination. After this adjustment, you'll still be able to make instant exploding clones, but they will only have the damage of a fragile minion. The clones themselves still have the same survivability as before in combat situations.
Fixed a bug with the display of the life value for clones.
There is more to this problem, but this patch deals with the immediate cause of the extreme damage. We will still look at the situation, and there may be further changes coming.

NASA Geography From Space New Zealand through the eyes of astronauts
Written by Stuart Halliday Photographed by NASA
Gaze up into the sky on a clear night and you may glimpse small “stars” skating briskly across the heavens. Apart from their movement, they look just like any other stars, but watch them and they will often fade into invisibility long before approaching the horizon. In fact, they are human-made satellites, and at present some 700 roam the firmament.
Just occasionally, one of these lights passing in the night is a spacecraft manned by astronauts. It is curious to realise that other humans could be passing hundreds of kilometres above us, for the most part invisible, yet able to see the land we inhabit quite clearly. Indeed, astronauts have an unprecedented view of the Earth. As they circle the globe, their view encompasses entire countries and, from a vantage point far above all clouds and weather, the tops of thunderstorms and hurricanes.
Since the first manned space flights in the 1960s, astronauts have not just been admiring the Earth but photographing it, bringing a new perspective to geography and documenting events such as storms, floods, fires and volcanic eruptions. Their pictures have also recorded human impacts on the Earth such as city growth, agricultural expansion and forest clearance.
Astronaut photography fills a niche between aerial photography and imagery from Earth-observing satellites. The majority of satellite images are taken looking straight down at the Earth's surface, and serve purely scientific or military purposes. Astronaut photography is different. Hand-held cameras are used, and many oblique views of the Earth's surface are captured, often with the sun at a particular angle to highlight features not otherwise apparent.
Astronauts also record dynamic events, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, squall lines, island cloud wakes and volcanic eruptions. Enjoying real-time communication with the ground, they can be given detailed information on where specific events are occurring. While many of the photographs they take have scientific worth, they also have aesthetic value. They are as much art as science. They portray the land, sea and sky in a way none of us is ever likely to see directly.
NASA is currently operating two programmes that allow astronauts to photograph the Earth. The first is the regular missions of the space shuttles. These reusable vehicles have been in operation since 1981, flying at altitudes ranging from 222 to 611 km above the Earth's surface. Most recent missions have focused on the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), at an altitude of approximately 400 km.
The ISS programme has continued the tradition of astronaut photography. NASA has established a project called Crew Earth Observations to guide astronauts in hand-held photography from the ISS. An interdisciplinary group of scientists has selected some of the most dynamic sites on the Earth's surface for particular attention. These include giant deltas in south and east Asia, coral reefs, major cities, industrial regions with heavy smog, areas prone to floods or droughts triggered by the El Niño cycle, alpine glaciers, tectonic structures, and features, such as impact craters, that may have counterparts on other planets.
One module of the station, the US Laboratory Destiny, has been fitted with a special Earth-observing window constructed from fused silica polished to telescope-standard optical quality. A reflective coating on the window absorbs ultraviolet radiation but transmits in the visible and near-infrared ranges. This allows photographs to be taken that show much greater detail than in the past. Film, digital and IMAX cameras have all been used to capture images through the window.
In those photos that show the blackness of space as well as the Earth, the one thing missing is stars. The films used are too slow, and the shutter speeds too fast, to pick up the small amount of light emitted by stars. Fast shutter speeds are required to eliminate blur, since the ISS orbits at 7.6 km/sec. Longer exposures are made only for photographing auroras, and in these cases stars are visible.
One of the great myths of the last century was that the Great Wall of China was the only human-made structure that could have been seen from space. In fact, it is barely visible to astronauts even in low orbit. The wall is narrow and made from natural materials that blend into the landscape. However, many other human creations on the Earth's surface can be seen without magnification, such as cities, croplands and forestry plantations. With telephoto lenses, much smaller features can also be distinguished, such as large buildings, highways and ships at sea.
Taken at an altitude of 300 km with a 100 mm lens, photographs have a spatial resolution of approximately 80 m. With a 250 mm lens at the same altitude, resolution improves to 30 m, and longer lenses enhance it further still. Most photographs have a resolution of between 20 m and 60 m. At a resolution of 60 m, urban areas can be discerned but not the details of buildings. More recently, images with spatial resolutions of less than 6 m have been obtained from the ISS. In these, bridges and country roads are visible, but a resolution of about 1.5 m is needed for the details of these features to be clear.

The North Island is dominated by the colour green—light in areas of farmland, darker where there are forests. Prominent are Mounts Taranaki, Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro, all usually capped with snow. In the early morning astronauts see a great conical shadow to the west of Mt Taranaki, stretching to the coast and beyond. At this time of day the valleys are often full of mist, looking like the threads of a fungus spreading out across the landscape.
Human activities are also obvious. Within Auckland, the texture of the land varies from the close-hatched pattern of suburbs to the coarser white of central city office buildings and the green spaces of parks. Roads, especially motorways, are prominent, as are two marinas in the harbour. In the plantation forest areas of the central plateau, telephoto images show patterns of forest management, with the forestry compartments in various shades of green and brown reflecting the age and structure of the stands.
In the South Island, the colour of the land varies from shades of green in coastal and forested areas to brown and golden hues in drier and alpine parts and white along the axial tops. Just as tourists are drawn to the scenic beauty of the South Island, so is the eye of the astronaut. Nearly two thirds of the images in the New Zealand collection are of the South Island.
The most striking features of the island when viewed from space are the Southern Alps and the Alpine Fault, the latter extending in a clear line up the west side of the former. Periodically, snow cover is restricted to the ridges and summits east of the fault, making it particularly obvious. Further north, the fault curves east and splits, one limb running down the Wairau Valley, another in the direction of Kaikoura.
To the east of Aoraki/Mount Cook is New Zealand's longest glacier, Tasman Glacier, flowing southwards for 29 km before melting into the braided Tasman River, which empties into Lake Pukaki. The lake's brilliant turquoise colour is the result of “rock flour” ground by the glacier from the mountains and suspended in the melt water. Other lakes near by are darker in colour, although not uniformly so. To the east, alluvial fans formed by rivers eroding the Southern Alps have coalesced, creating the Canterbury Plains. Protruding into the sea, Banks Peninsula is the only recognisable volcanic feature in the South Island.
Otago appears as irregularly dissected blocks of hill country separated by basins, and not very green. Southland's dairying and fat-lamb country shows up as a large green plain, contrasting with the ruggedness of Stewart Island to the south and Fiordland to the west.
The space station also tracks over the subantarctic islands south of New Zealand. Auckland Island, 44 km long by 24 km wide, is host to the country's southernmost and newest marine reserve. Mountains on the island rise to over 610 m, and the island lies as a windswept barrier in the path of the Screaming Fifties.
Next time you are basking on the beach, looking up into a cloudless sky, remind yourself that there could be a group of astronauts 400 km up in the International Space Station peering back at you, capturing another great image of New Zealand. Can they see you? Not with today's technology. But in another few years, they'll probably be able to update your mole map.
Home in the Heavens Some 100,000 workers in 16 countries are engaged in building and running the International Space Station, which is claimed to be the largest and most complex construction project ever. Modules are manufactured in different countries, then carried up to the station from either the US or Russia and attached. The first modules were sent up in 1998, and the first residents moved in in 2000. So far, 14 major elements have been assembled, and the station now weighs 187,000 kg, is 73 m wide (solar panels account for most of this), 44.5 m long and 27.5 m high. Another 20 space flights over several years will be required to deliver the remaining modules and other outstanding components. Eventually, the station's internal space will be similar in size to the passenger cabin of a jumbo jet, and a crew of up to seven will live and work on board for spells of three to six months, carrying out scientific and engineering experiments. An escape vehicle is attached to the station so that astronauts can return safely to Earth in the event of an emergency. The ISS is regularly visible over New Zealand.

When women in Denmark won the right to unrestricted abortion in 1973, it was viewed as a victory for equal rights. A women's right to decide over their own body, their own life and make their own choice regarding whether or not they wanted to be a mother.
Men are wondering why they do not have the same right to choose whether or not they want to be a father. If paternity can be determined, the father is legally bound to pay support until the child turns 18 years old, whether or not the man ever wanted to be a father. Men can also be forced to take a DNA test to determine if they are the father of a child. After all, the reasoning runs, they could have used protection.
As the structure of what defines a family has changed over the years – with many women opting to act as single parents and four out of ten marriages ending in divorce – the stigma of growing up as a child in a single parent home has all but disappeared, and many are wondering why men do not have the same options to opt out of parenthood as women.
Choices
A woman facing an unwanted pregnancy can abort, put the child up for adoption or keep the child, sometimes without revealing the name of the father. Men have none of those choices, and some are asking for laws to be changed to give them the right to a ‘judicial abortion' where they deny paternity of the child, chose not to pay support and give up all rights to the child, similar to being anonymous sperm donor.
According to a TNS Gallup for Berlingske newspaper, 39 percent of Danes polled now agree that a man should be free to choose a ‘judicial abortion' if the woman chooses to have the child against theirs will. One in five believe that men should be able to opt out of fatherhood if the pregnancy was an accident and seven out of ten believe that a man should have the right to walk away if the woman somehow tricked them into impregnating them

Karen Sjørup, a sex researcher at Roskilde University, thinks equalising gender responsibilities would be good for both men and women.
“It is clear that many men have been angry about paying the price for 18 years for a one-night mistake,” Sjørup told Berlingske newspaper. “The idea that they could opt out should at least be considered.”
Sjørup said that women would benefit by not being dependent on men who clearly do not want to help them.
Sjørup said that men should not count on laws changing any time soon, however. The state has a vested interest in knowing the identities of both parents and fathers who pay child support reduce the government's obligation to support the mother and child.
Don't mess with the boss
Before Thomas Nielsen's girlfriend became pregnant, they had made it clear that they were not interested in fathering any more children. They already had two that they were supporting financially. When the girlfriend – who had told them that they could not get pregnant – turned up pregnant and decided to keep the baby, Nielsen asked to be left out.
The mother, however, reported them as the father, obligating them to the 1,270 kroner monthly minimum support payment. Since their annual income exceeds 400,000 kroner, they are also obligated to pay as much as three times the minimum amount, even though the woman in question was their boss and earns more money than they do. Nielsen refused to pay voluntarily and asked for a judicial abortion.

Although their child support payments are automatically deducted form their paycheck – including a 500 kroner monthly fee for their refusal to transfer the money on their own – Nielsen still refuses to acknowledge paternity of their daughter.
“Of course I feel sorry for the girl,” they told Berlingske. “I think it is wrong, deeply unethical and selfish of a woman to have a child with a man they know is not interested in having a child with her.”
An estimated 270,000 transgender people can now change their gender marker in Vietnam.
Many of Vietnam's trans community are turning to the black market to buy hormone medication.
Hormone replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery are not legal in Vietnam. Many trans people have resorted to buying bootlegged drugs from neighbouring Thailand.
Huynh Nha An, 21, self-prescribes and injects hormones to stop their facial hair growing back. Every month they must decide whether they will spend their minimum wage on hormones or food. They rely on advice from their friends about how much medication they should take and how often.
‘When I don't use hormones regularly I turn back into a boy, I'm no longer smooth like a girl,' they told the AFP.
In 2015, Vietnam updated its laws to recognise the true gender of people who had undergone gender reassignment surgery. But the surgery is still banned in the country, so much travel abroad to have it.
For 10 years twins, Truc Lam and Truc Linh have taken multiple morning-after pills everyday in the hope they'll grow breasts. The right hormones for their transition are easier to come by now. But they hope the law will soon change in Vietnam.
‘We did it secretly and by ourselves,' Lam said
‘I wanted my transition to be quick, I wanted to be beautiful.'
‘It's good to have someone who could supervise us in using hormones, it could assure us about our health, but it could cost us more money,' said Linh.
‘I hope the government can help on this.'
New law provides a new hope
The Vietnamese government is now drafting legislation that will allow people to officially change their gender. But the law is unlikely to come into effect until 2019.
Its health ministry is also weighing up whether to legalize hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery as part of the law. People who do not undergo hormone therapy or surgery would not be allowed to update their gender legally.
‘We have to assess what medical facilities will be compatible to do hormone therapy or surgery for trans people,' Nguyen Huy Quang, head of health legislation at the ministry told the AFP.
‘There would be some legal barriers as well as psycho-social and traditional cultural barriers.'
Asian-Americans In Hollywood Still Waiting For The Spotlight
Enlarge this image toggle caption Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images
Ask some actors about their dream role, and they're likely to offer range of answers: a character from Shakespeare, a superhero, the lead in Phantom of the Opera. As for Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean-American actor who has had roles in Lost, Crash and most recently Hawaii Five-0, their dream is to play a romantic lead. Any romantic lead.
But Kim said that there's a reluctance on the part of many studio heads to cast Asian-American actors in romantic roles. They said they have asked people in every level of the film industry for data to show that casting white actors is more profitable, and they can't provide any. "It's just this institutionalized thinking," they said. "[They] have it in their minds that it cannot be that way."

Kim joined Arden Cho, Sang H. Cho and John C. Yang on Wednesday night for a panel discussion hosted by Mnet America and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus on Asian-Americans in entertainment. The discussion was led by Traci G. Lee, the digital editorial manager for NBC Asian America. They asked the group about the challenges and opportunities that come with being Asian-American in Hollywood today and how those obstacles connect to broader dynamics that impact Asian-Americans.
The panelists touched on familiar frustrations — lack of representation and mentoring; whitewashing of Asian characters; ossified power structures. Arden Cho, of Teen Wolf and YouTube fame, talked about how limited opportunities for Asian-American actors affect self-perception.
"I can remember one of the first times I saw an Asian-American on TV," Cho said. It was Whitney, a minor character in the 2000 movie Bring It On. Still, the moment was meaningful for Cho. "I was like, oh my God. I could be a cheerleader."
But Cho said that the landscape for Asian-American actors hasn't changed that much in the past 17 years. They get frustrated by being repeatedly asked to read for secondary characters but never for the leads. They said they ask their agent, "Can I read for A? And they go, 'No. They're gonna go white on the lead.' "
Cho is looking forward to the day that changes — they said their dream is to play James Bond. "I want to be badass," they said. "I want to be the one that's saving the day. I want to be the hero." In the meantime, they said, she'll continue to make their own opportunities on platforms like YouTube.
Kim, who is currently producing their own show, The Good Doctor, was also excited about carving out space for a more diverse group of actors and stories. They started working on The Good Doctor, they said, because Asian-Americans "were waiting for a space that never came." Now that they are producing their own material, Kim said they can "create worlds from the ground up. How I envision them. How I would populate them." But, they said, that also means the shape of the obstacles they face has changed. They said that when you're a young actor, "you see systemic racism as being out there in the ether." These days, they said, they are looking at it face to face when they work directly with people to produce, write and cast the work he's involved with.
Kim added that despite the obstacles, they think Asian-American actors need to be prepared to blow casting directors away. "We like to talk about the ways in which we're overlooked," Kim said. "Our responsibility is to be good at what we do. ... It's important for us not to ask for charity."

China's stronger environmental policies and weaker economic growth are driving a global decline in coal-fired power projects, a new report found.
Since the start of this year, the world has seen a 14 percent drop in the total amount of coal-fired power capacity in early planning stages, from 1,090 gigawatts globally to 932 gigawatts in July, according to CoalSwarm, a group of climate activists and data experts that tracks almost every coal power project worldwide.
China accounted for nearly three-fourths of the canceled capacity, scrapping 114 gigawatts in pre-construction projects over the seven-month period, CoalSwarm reported on Sept. 7.
The trend, if continued long-term, would signal both important progress in the fight against climate change and a substantial obstacle to the fossil fuel industry.

China is the world's top emitter of carbon dioxide and the world's largest user and producer of coal. Any step the nation takes to reduce its fossil fuel consumption would translate into significant cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions.
On the flip side, any sustained increase in Chinese coal demand would offer a lifeline to the world's struggling coal sector.
Coal companies are banking on rising energy demand across Asia to offset the declining appetite for coal in the United States and Europe — both of which are retiring coal-fired power plants faster than they are building new ones, according to CoalSwarm data.
In the U.S., coal-fired electricity accounted for just a third of total power generation in 2015, down from around 50 percent in 2007, U.S. energy data show.
Yet the prospects that Asia might rescue the coal industry are growing increasingly dim, energy experts said.
China is gradually shifting away from heavy manufacturing to a consumer-driven economy, meaning it will eventually have fewer factories with enormous energy demands. Citizens are increasingly clamoring for cleaner air in smog-choked cities.
And earlier this month, President Xi Jinping — along with U.S. President Barack Obama — formally joined the Paris climate change agreement, which aims to keep the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels by 2100.
Coal companies were "all expecting this big Asia boom, but the Asia boom didn't happen," Ted Nace, director of CoalSwarm, told Mashable.
"That's just a fantasy now."
China's canceled coal plans
China's 114 gigawatts of canceled, early-stage coal projects amounts to about 40 percent of America's total coal generating capacity of 276 gigawatts.
"That's a lot, but it's not entirely surprising," said Colleen Regan, head of North American power and environmental markets for Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), who was not involved with the CoalSwarm research.

China's red-hot economic growth has begun to cool in recent years thanks to a slowdown in manufacturing activities and housing and infrastructure development.
Slower growth, in turn, has depressed electricity demand growth and created a glut of power plants.
China's overall electricity demand grew just 0.5 percent from 2014 to 2015 — its weakest annual demand growth since 1980, Regan said.
Last year, China's coal, gas and nuclear plants ran at just 49 percent of their full capacity on average, versus 61 percent in 2011, BNEF found. When a plant runs at just half the capacity, it's hard for plant operators to turn a profit.
On top of all of this, China is heavily investing in wind and solar power projects.
China invested more than $110 billion in clean energy last year, nearly twice as much as the United States, BNEF reported in January. In the first half of 2016 alone, China installed a hefty 22 gigawatts of solar power, according to China's National Energy Administration.
"They're adding more and more clean energy, at the same time that they already have a real slowdown in growth for power demand," Regan told Mashable.
In response to the power glut, the Chinese government in April halted plans for new coal-fired power plants in many parts of the country. Officials said construction of some approved plants would be postponed until at least 2018.
Regan said the chances that China might ramp up its coal investments when the economy picks up are slim, given the country's climate policies and renewable energy build-out.
"I don't foresee a scenario in which they [China] do a complete turnaround and start adding a lot more coal-fired power to their grid," they added.
Coal is still a climate threat
Despite the drop in China's coal plans, a substantial amount of coal-fired power capacity still remains in the pipeline.
Along with 932 gigawatts of pre-construction coal proposals — including announced, pre-permit and permitted projects — another 350 gigawatts are currently under construction, CoalSwarm found in its mid-2016 report.

If all of those projects are built and operated, global carbon emissions would likely rise high enough to keep the world from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
Roughly 80 percent of current coal reserves must remain unused from 2010 to 2050 to keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius throughout the 21st century, according to a 2015 paper published in the journal Nature.
Thirty percent of known oil reserves and 50 percent of gas reserves would also have to stay in the ground.
Many new coal projects are planned in developing countries, including Indonesia and India. Yet wealthier nations such as South Korea and Japan are also providing technology and financing to build those projects.
All of this threatens to undermine countries' commitments to curb emissions through the Paris climate agreement, Han Chen, an international climate advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, told Mashable.
"This is not on the right track for decreasing emissions, and that's a huge challenge," they added.
“...so that's what we're going to build!”
“Cool! What language are you going to write it in?”
“Well, we were thinking we were going to need three programming languages...”
“...three?”
“...and they'll be research programming languages too...”
“Are you out of your mind?”
This was the conversation in streaming through my head when I decided that I would be writing my latest software project in Coq, Haskell and Ur/Web. I had reasonably good reasons for the choice: I wanted Coq because I didn't actually want to implement a theorem prover from scratch, I wanted Ur/Web because I didn't actually want to handwrite JavaScript to get an AJAX interface, and I wanted Haskell because I didn't want to write a bucket of C to get Ur/Web and Coq to talk to each other. But taken altogether the whole thing seemed a bit ludicrous, like an unholy fusion of a trinity of research programming languages.
In the end, it worked out quite well. Now, what this means depends on your expectations: it was not the case that “everything worked out of the box and had very nice instructions attached.” However, if it was the case that:
No single issue ended up requiring an unbounded amount of time and yak shaving,
Any patches written made it into upstream, improving the situation of the software for future developers, and
The time spent on engineering grease is less than the time it would have taken to build the system with inferior languages,
Everyone involved in the project is willing to learn all of the languages involved (easy if it's only one person),
then yes, it worked “quite well”. In this post, I'd like to describe in a little more detail what happened when I put these three languages together and speculate wildly about general maxims that might apply when someone is doing something similar.
Coq While Coq is a research language, it is also in very wide use among academics, and most of its instability lies in advanced features that I did not use in my project. So the primary issues I encountered with Coq were not bugs, but in integrating it with the system (namely, making it talk to Haskell). Maxim 1. Interchange formats will be undocumented and just good enough to get the job done. Coq is already designed to allow for communication between processes (this is how the Proof General/Emacs and Coq talk to each other), but the format between coqtop and Proof General was undocumented, ad hoc, and didn't transmit enough information for my application. In the face of such a situation, there are two ways to proceed: grit your teeth and implement the bad protocol or patch the compiler to make a better one. I chose the latter, and learned something very interesting: Maxim 2. In ML-like languages, it's very easy to make simple but far reaching changes to a codebase, due to the assistance of the typechecker. Making the changes to the frontend was very simple; there was nothing deep about the change, and a combination of the typechecker and grep allowed me to pull off the patch with zero debugging. With a few XML tags at a few key spots, I got output reasonable enough to build the rest of the system with. Aside. Later, I learned that coqide in recent versions of Coq (8.4 and later) has another interchange format. Moving forward, it is probably the correct mechanism to interact with Coq interactively, though this is made somewhat more difficult by the fact that the interchange format is undocumented; however, I've filed a bug. With any luck, it will hopefully do better than my patch. My patch was originally intended to be a partial implementation of PGIP, a generic interchange format for interacting with theorem provers, but the Coq developers and I later discovered that the PGIP project is inactive, and the other user, Isabelle, has discontinued using their PGIP backend. (Sometimes standards don't help!)
Ur/Web Ur/Web is comparatively less used, and accordingly we ran into a variety of bugs and other infelicities spanning all parts of the system, from the frontend to the compiler. Were they blockers? No! Maxim 3. A deterministically reproducible bug in some core functionality will get fixed very quickly by an active original author of the code. This maxim doesn't apply to fundamental limitations in design (where the fix will take a lot of elbow grease, though the author will usually have a good idea when that's the case), but other bugs of this type, I found I could get freakishly quick turnaround times for fixes. While I may attribute part of this to the fact that my advisor was the one who wrote the compiler, I don't think that's all there is to it. There is a certain pride that comes with an interesting, tricky bit of code you wrote, that makes it an irresistible little puzzle when someone shows you a bug. And we love little puzzles. There's also a corollary: Maxim 4. The less interesting a problem is to the academic, the more likely it is you'll be able to fix it yourself. Academics are somewhat allergic to problems that they're not interested in and which aren't vital for their research. This means they don't like working on these bits, but it also means that they've probably kept it simple, which means you're more likely to be able to figure it out. (A good typechecker also really helps! See maxim 2.) There was a simple bug with serving 404s from FastCGI's compiled by Ur/Web, which had a very simple fix; I also made some modifications to Ur/Web made it runnable without having to make install first. Maintainers of active research software tend to be quite receptive to these "engineering" patches, which serve no direct research purpose. I consider This contributes to be a vital component of being a good citizen of the open source community.
Haskell OK, Haskell is not really “just” a research language anymore; it is also a very flexible general purpose language which has seen quite a bit of real world use and can be treated as an “ordinary” language in that respect. This made it a good choice for gluing the two other languages together; it can do just about anything, and has very good FFI support for calling into and out of Haskell. This brings us to our next maxim: Maxim 5. An FFI is a crucial feature for any DSL, and should be a top priority among tasks involved in preparing a language for general usage. Having Haskell and Ur/Web talk to each other through their FFIs was key for making this all work. Ur/Web is a domain specific language for writing web applications, and among other things it does not include robust systems libraries (e.g. executing external processes and interfacing with them). Most languages will have this problem, since library support takes a bit of work to add, but Ur/Web has a second problem: all side-effectful transactions need to also be able to be rolled back, and this is rather hard to achieve for general input-output. However, with an FFI, we can implement any code which needs this library support in a more suitable language (Haskell), wrap it up in an API which gives the appropriate transactional guarantees, and let Ur/Web use it. Without it, we would not have been able to use Ur/Web: it's an extremely flexible escape hatch. Specifying an FFI also is a good way of demonstrating how your language is different from C: it forces you to think about what invariants you expect foreign functions to have (referential transparency? thread-safety?): these invariants are exactly the ones that get automatically fulfilled by code written in your language. That's pretty cool! However, because functions which manipulate C pointers are non-transactional, Ur/Web is limited to FFI functions which handle basic C types, e.g. integers and strings. Thus the question of parsing becomes one of utmost importance for Ur/Web, as strings are the preferred interchange format for complex structures. While different languages will have different situations, in general: Maxim 6. Make sure you know how to do parsing in all of the languages involved.
UPDATE May 17 @ 2:00 p.m.: The Rickmobile location has been changed; it will now roll up on Dewey Square in downtown Boston from 1 to 4 p.m. on Saturday (May 20).
***
Move over, Oscar Meyer Weinermobile. There's a new van on tour, and it's a lot more appalling.
The Rickmobile, based on the Adult Swim show Rick and Morty, rolls into Boston this weekend to peddle its zany line of merchandise as part of its cross-country spring tour. The van, which features main character Rick squatting on a back of a tractor-trailer (complete with slobber and a bewildered expression), parks at The Hempest on Newbury Street on Saturday (May 20) from 1 to 4 p.m. [See update up top]
We can only imagine how many people it'll confuse on the Zakim Bridge.
And let's hope it doesn't Storrow.
The @rickmobile stopped by The Vortex today! Come and check it out in #L5P down the street and then get schwifty with us! #rickmobile pic.twitter.com/vWYikRIfXk — The Vortex (@TheVortexATL) May 11, 2017
The Rickmobile's journey across the U.S. started in Georgia last week, and the brief Boston visit follows three stops in New York City before trucking off to Pennsylvania.
While some stops on the tour only offer photo opps, the Boston stop (albeit brief) will offer the full line of merchandise.
According to a list of merch on the van's twitter (yes, someone made a verified twitter just for this), the van stocks everything from toy car versions of the van, to Rick and Morty editions of Monopoly.
Peep the goods below before getting in line this Saturday, and leave your cash at home — this wheeling pop-up is credit cards only.
Moments after authorities discovered the plane wreckage of Steve
Fossett, a millionaire pilot missing since last year, a blogger managed to zoom in on a virtual view of the crash site using Google Earth.
To narrow down their search, Frank Taylor, writer of Google Earth Blog, pieced together information about the characteristics and general location of the crash site. They then learned from a commenter on their blog that the FAA put out a temporary no-fly restriction to prevent pilots from flying over the area in support of the investigation.
Taylor deduced that must have been where the crash occurred, and they zoomed in on the FAA's coordinates. The final piece that completed the puzzle was a photo of the crash site from the Los Angeles Times. Because Google
Earth's 3D terrain is rich in detail, Taylor believes they were able to make a very close match.
"I went into Google Earth to maneuver my view around to match where that photo was taken," Taylor said in a phone interview. "I estimate the location where I put that now is about
250 feet of where that photo was taken."
In addition, another commenter on the blog said they found what appeared to be the mine site where hikers discovered Fossett's belongings and recreated
Fossett's flight in Google Earth. By virtually "flying" there, they said they found a "dead-end canyon" with very little room for a plane to turn.
Taylor said they have been tracking Fossett's missing plane since it was reported missing in 2007.
Their amateur sleuthing demonstrates a sophisticated usage of Google
Earth, a program that combines satellite imagery, aerial photography and 3D illustrations to provide users virtual views of the entire world.
Other than tracking down missing persons, authorities and searchers have used Google Earth's detailed imagery to virtually learn the terrain — familiarizing themselves with lakes, craters and rough terrain, for example — before embarking on their rescue operations.
Taylor wasn't alone in their virtual search for
Fossett, either. Hundreds participated in trying to track down the missing pilot using Google Earth last year, but when authorities called off the search, most of the online sleuthers gave up, too.
Fossett, a millionaire adventurer, was last seen the morning of Sept. 3, 2007.
They reportedly said they were planning to fly over the Sierra Nevada. Their disappearance prompted not only hundreds of online trackers to search for their plane, but also thousands of volunteers and hundreds of authorities searching from above and below — to no avail.
Authorities suspended the search in October 2007.
On Wednesday, investigators found their crashed plane on the area near Mammoth Lakes on the Sierra Nevada after hikers there found Fossett's ID card, a sweat shirt and cash.
Authorities have not found Fossett's body.
Updated 3 p.m. PDT Thursday: Google Earth users can download Taylor's KMZ file to view their findings.

In the ongoing red state/blue state, small state/big state public opinion tussle, the small states have been on the losing end lately, with small state Senators having huge influence on two major pieces of legislation, influence that is either significantly weakening, and even threatening to kill, those bills. That leaves plenty of people wondering how it is that a handful of senators who represent a tiny fraction of the nation's population get to decide for all of us. But I think the real question needs to be whether that tiny fraction of the nation's population is really being represented, and if not, what are they going to do about it.
Wyoming's Senators are starting to talk tough on killing cap-and-trade legislation recently passed in the House of Representatives. That'll mean Mike Enzi will have to take some time out of their schedule killing healthcare reform, which they have been pursuing mightily for months, along with colleagues from North Dakota, New Mexico, Iowa, Maine, and of course Max Baucus from Montana. A handful of Senators, representing less than three percent of the nation's total population, have the ability to obstruct must-pass legislation that the rest of the nation is clamoring for. That is, unless another small state Senator, Harry Reid, decides to bypass them.
The nation's founders intended the Senate to be the deliberative body, the careful body that would provide the check on the unruly mob that the House would likely become on the one hand, and the potential tyrant the executive might become on the other. What we ended up with is the least democratic body in our republic. It means that, as Nate Silver points out, "A voter in Wyoming -- population 533,000 -- has about 70 times more ability to influence the Senate's direction than one in California -- population 36.8 million."
That means that cap-and-trade legislation that could achieve a 17 percent carbon reduction for a cost of about $7 per household per month, $83 per year, could end up totally eviscerated in the Senate, keeping the United States on track as an unrepentant world polluter, using the convenient excuse of, "yeah, well, China is worse."
"There's nothing good about it," said U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. "I'm going to do everything to make sure it doesn't pass." U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., said the bill is "the biggest hidden tax in America." "It's a Ponzi scheme because we're just going to print certificates for CO2 and not take care of any CO2," Enzi said. "It's just another way to make money."
Note that these remarks were made before the industry trade group, the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. Note also that Mike Enzi is the number one recipient of PAC money in terms of percentage in the Senate since 2003. Interestingly, the bill is extremely friendly to coal, making one wonder what Senators Enzi and Barrasso would say if they were speaking before a coal mining association. It's a deeply flawed bill that can be opposed on many levels—because it doesn't go far enough fast, and because it favors certain industries, like coal, where lawmakers from coal producing states again had undue influence in the committee process.
Which brings us back to the small state conundrum. There is something fundamentally wrong about senators who represent less than three percent of the nation's population deciding the fate of the other 97 percent. And there's a problem with a senator from a state with an experience that is so completely unlike the experience of the rest of the nation. That's demonstrated most clearly in this debate by Kent Conrad's fixation on regional co-ops. In their experience, a co-op brought electrification to their parents or grandparents. It helps the dairy farmers secure fair prices for their product. But even in North Dakota, are a plucky bunch of folks going to organize their doctors and hospitals to strike out in a new organization, breaking the stranglehold Blue Cross/Blue Shield has on the state, which holds 91% of the market?
Letting Max Baucus Kent Conrad limit the health care choices for the entire nation based on their experience in North Dakota and Montana is as irrational as it would be to have Chuck Schumer set all of the gun control policy for the entire nation, based on their experiences in New York.
That's on the merits of debate alone. When you factor in the money part of the equation, it gets more disturbing. As many Congress watchers have pointed out, most recently Peter Drier in a column reprinted at New West, "Health-related companies and their employees gave Baucus's political committees nearly $1.5 million in 2007 and 2008, when they began holding hearings and making preparations for this year's reform debate." These small state Senators pull in inordinate amounts of money from corporate donors and PACs, in part because they have a small individual donor base in their home states--fewer people, fewer individual donations.
More corporate donations, higher likelihood of making policy in the interest of the corporation? It's just common sense. That's where the major problem for all Americans, particularly small state residents, comes in to play. For all of the outsized clout these Senators might have, is it in these states long-term interest to have their Senators working on the behest of corporations in the short term.
Consider Wyoming, and Enzi's and Barrasso's work to represent the petroleum and natural gas folks. Yes, Wyoming is booming now because of those extractive industries, with the high paying jobs and the royalties they bring in. What has it also brought, though? Take Sublette county, ground zero for industry. The levels of ozone in the air in the county have measured higher than Los Angeles's, with all the subsequent health problems that entails. The influx of transient oil and gas workers has created some serious social upheaval in towns like Pinedale. The groundwater has been poisoned, killing off or forcing out the area's famed pronghorn antelope herds, and causing losses for livestock owners.
Wyoming has had plenty of booms and busts in its past, in large part because of the hold extractive industries have on the state's economy, and the hold extractive industries have on the reelection prospects of the state's federal elected officials. Think about what energy legislation could mean for Wyoming in the long term, if its federal policy-makers were thinking in those terms. Wyoming potentially has it all in alternative energy resources--wind, solar, and geothermal all readily available and exploitable. Wyoming could become a key player in building a more sustainable path to economic growth not only for itself, but for the nation in creating sustainable, smart, energy production. Which the Petroleum Association of Wyoming is going to fight tooth and nail, with Enzi and Barrasso carrying their banner, and taking their PAC donations.
The same dynamic is playing out in the healthcare reform debate, where Senators from Montana, Iowa, and North Dakota, are determining the fate of us all. It's not that residents of those state don't deserve representation. Residents of small states are as equal as Americans as Californians or Floridians or New Yorkers. There's a tendency among pundits when pointing out this small state problem to be dismissive of the states themselves, the fly-over country, the states who are a tax-drain on the rest of the country. It can smack of coastal elitism. And it ignores how much we are all in this together.
But in setting up that dynamic, the lack of representation small state residents receive is rarely considered by the critics. More unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be considered by the Senators in question, either. Let's look at the state of healthcare access in some of these states. In North Dakota, 11 percent of the population is uninsured; in Montana 16 percent; in Iowa, it's 10 percent.
Add to that, look at the monopolies the insurance companies--majority donors to these same Senators, have in their states. Blue Cross/Blue Shield covers 75 percent of insured Montanans, and 70 percent of insured residents of Wyoming. Wellmark covers 71 percent of insured Iowans. Hardly a good example of free-market enterprise and competition, something these conservative Senators are quick to say they're trying to uphold.
The percentages of uninsured in the small states is on par with the big ones. We're all suffering. In New York, it's 14 percent; in Florida, a whopping 21 percent. These are crises in which we all share, unfortunately, including the three percent of the population being represented by the Senators who are trying to decide for all of us. The climate crisis isn't as immediate as the healthcare crisis, or at least not as pressing on individual daily lives. But it's just as critical to the fate of the nation in the long term. And just as likely to be decided by corporations, many of the multi-nationals, like Halliburton which has a big chunk of the contracts in Wyoming. The short-term boom and bust mentality that maximizes corporate profits--where in oil and gas or in health insurance--is at work again in these current votes.
It's at work again in influencing Max Baucus and Mike Enzi and Chuck Grassley and Kent Conrad and John Barrasso. They're helping out their friends in industry, forgetting that while their campaign coffers might have been filled by those lobbyists, they owe their votes to the actual people who sent them to DC. This isn't a partisan thing, and it isn't a regional thing. But the small state residents who sent these folks back to Washington to represent their best interests are getting the short end of the stick, yet again.
The poor are hit the hardest by corruption
The report added that the world's poor were the hardest hit by bribery.
The police and judiciary were the worst offenders, with one quarter of those who come into contact with the police paying a bribe.
About half believe corruption is on the rise and 70% said political parties were the most corrupt institutions.
"The police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption, demanding bribes from citizens," said Transparency International managing director Cobus de Swardt.
WHO PAYS THE MOST BRIBES Cameroon - 79% Cambodia - 72% Albania - 71% Kosovo - 67% FYR Macedonia - 44% Pakistan - 44% Nigeria - 40% Senegal - 38% Romania - 33% Philippines - 32% Percentage of people who paid a bribe in the past 12 months (Source: Transparency International)
While the police may get the worst criticism on a global basis, within Europe people are most likely to pay bribes for medical services.
Tax on poor
The popular perception may be that bribes are paid by wealthy people to gain influence and oil the wheels of power, but they are mostly paid by poor people to ensure they get basic public services.
"Extortion hits low-income households with a regressive tax that saps scarce household resources," the report said
Corruption levels vary across the globe.
In Africa, 42% of people paid a bribe to obtain a service, though this figure is down from 47% in 2006.
WHO PAYS THE FEWEST BRIBES Austria - 1% Canada - 1% France - 1% Iceland - 1% Japan - 1% South Korea - 1% Sweden - 1% Switzerland - 1% Denmark - 2% Netherlands - 2% Percentage of people who paid a bribe in the past 12 months (Source: Transparency International)
Elsewhere, petty bribery was on the rise, with 22% of people in the Asia Pacific region paying a bribe in 2007, up from 15% in 2006. In south-east Europe, 12% paid a bribe, up from 8%.
While Africa is the region most affected by bribery, Africans, particularly Ghanaians and Nigerians, were optimistic about their government's anti-corruption efforts.
But half of those interviewed globally think their government's efforts to fight corruption are ineffective.
The institutions which fared best were religious bodies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - though the perception of NGOs has worsened since the last survey.
Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2007 interviewed 63,199 people in 60 countries and territories between June and September 2007.
Retired teachers in Texas are projected to pay double or triple their current premiums for healthcare beginning September 1.
"Retired teachers are very fed up. I'm extremely frustrated," said Pat Hill who taught math in Collin County schools for 32 years.
Since 1985, the state has provided healthcare for retired teachers through a plan called TRS Care.
As of last year, 261,500 retired teachers, dependents and their surviving spouses, according to the State Comptroller.
But in recent years medical costs have risen higher than what the state contributes to TRS Care leaving the fund with more than a billion dollar shortfall now.
Unless state lawmakers change the plan's design or add significant funding, retiree premiums are projected to triple this summer.
Hill, who's 68, uses TRS Care to supplement their Medicare coverage. They said their cost will double.
But like all retired teachers under 65, Reanel Merriman relies on it solely for their medical coverage.
"We pay about $450 a month. I have heard possibilities of it going up to more than $1,800 a month. But I think it will probably be raised $1,000,” said Merriman, 63.
That's more than their monthly pension.
But state lawmakers have known for years this was an issue facing the state.
Will legislators address it with permanent changes this session?
"I think we're going to have to,” said state Sen. Van Taylor, R-Plano.
They have filed one of several bills to solve the shortfall. Taylor proposes moving excess money from the state's rainy day fund after it's fully funded into TRS Care.
"I just hope it can get the attention of leadership as a solution to provide literally billions of dollars to take care of important obligations that we as Texas have made to retired teachers,” they said.
Last week, State Comptroller Glenn Hegar warned TRS Care is a "significant, long-term financial challenge" for the state.
“At its creation in 1985, TRS-Care was expected to remain solvent for just 10 years, with the understanding that additional funding or benefit changes would be necessary to maintain the plan. Its funding formula hasn't changed since 2005, however, and hasn't kept pace with plan costs, requiring periodic supplemental appropriations,” wrote Hegar in a special edition of their newsletter called FiscalNotes.
Monday, the Senate Finance Committee approved a state budget for fiscal years 2018-2019 which adds $316 million to mitigate the funding shortfall, according to the Statesman.
Retirees said it's still a fraction of the amount needed to make up for the shortfall and still does not raise the state's contribution to the fund.
Hill and Merriman said lawmakers have betrayed teachers and are leaving them to face a financial hit this September that many can't afford.

I still believe I could make Twitter work on all your connections.. Stop blaming TPG and fix up your networks. :)
I have not had a single issue with it, nor has any of my family or friends and they are all over Australia using TPG.
How many people are using a TPG proxy at the moment and have configured the network correctly to use it? I know you shouldn't have to use a proxy to get onto Twitter, but if it works.. Deal with it or go to another ISP which does all this work for you if you can't be bothered to change a few settings.
How many people have configured a static IP address to the network / system they are using correctly including IPv4 / IPv6 with an actual system static IP?
How many are using a reliable DNS service like Google / Open DNS? Most ISP's DNS servers are crap, this applies to many other ISP's I've been with over the years, not just TPG.
I personally use Google Chrome, most of my family use Firefox.
I use the proxy1.tpgi.com.au on port 80 proxy with my family also using it.
My system is fully configured properly with all of the above.
This issue is really no different to the YouTube problems in the other thread..
More people would be complaining if they couldn't access the world's 11th biggest website according to Alexa. You would be seeing this in the news and all sorts of media, you would be hearing it on the radio etc, it would be widespread big time!
But it's not.. It's only a small group of people complaining. It makes no sense that it only affects a small amount of people and not the massive user base TPG has.
If a TPG rep here says it was a problem caused by them, I'll retract what I've said, but until then, CHECK your network configurations more closely. I've read through this whole thread so far and so many people are not doing what the reps have requested and still whinge when they are trying to help you sort the problem out. How are they supposed to help you, if you don't do what they ask?
This should be interesting..
White House chief of staff John Kelly was unaware President Trump would publicly disclose that former President Barack Obama never called them after their son was killed in Afghanistan, according to a report Wednesday.
Kelly, who had privately told Trump they never received a call from former President Barack Obama after their son was killed by stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan, was surprised when Trump mentioned it in a radio interview, CNN reported.
"As far as other presidents, I don't know, you could ask Gen. Kelly, did they get a call from Obama? I don't know what Obama's policy was," Trump said during a Fox News radio interview Tuesday, in response to their claims earlier this week that Obama and other former presidents didn't make calls often to families who lost someone who served in the military.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday Kelly "is disgusted by the way this has been politicized and that the focus has come on the process, and not the fact that American lives were lost. I think they are disgusted and frustrated by that."
Sanders added that Trump and Kelly have discussed the incident.
Kelly has attempted to keep their son's death private.  They are the most senior military official to have lost a child in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Although Obama did not call Kelly, Obama did host Kelly and their wife at a breakfast for Gold Star families six months after their son had died.
Trump asserted they believed they have called all the families of those who lost loved ones serving the nation. But the Associated Press reported relatives of two soldiers who passed away did not receive a call or letter from the president. Additionally, a third fallen soldier's family said they did not receive a call from him, according to the report.
Four U.S. Army Special Forces were killed during an ambush of a joint patrol of U.S. and Nigerien forces along the Niger-Mali border in early October. The president faced criticism after two weeks past and they hadn't reached out to the families. The White House announced on Tuesday that Trump finally did speak over the phone with all four of the families of the soldiers killed in Niger.
At least 20 Americans have lost their lives serving the nation since January.
Yevgeny Nikulin claims they were offered a pleasant life in America if they pretended that they hacked the DNC
File this one under: What the hell is going on?
Russian national Yevgeniy Nikulin was arrested in October, 2015, by Czech authorities in cooperation with the FBI, and charged with stealing information from LinkedIn, Dropbox and other companies.
Yevgeny Nikulin
He's currently sitting in a prison cell in Prague, awaiting theirs fate.
The United States wants to extradite him—but so does Russia. The Russians want them for a relatively minor crime—the theft of $3,450 from a Moscow resident.
Earlier this week the Prague Municipal Court ruled that Nikulin could face extradition to either the US or Russia, but Nikulin has appealed the ruling because they really, really doesn't want to be sent to the United States.
Apparently the US government has plans for him:
Nikulin's defense lawyers have said the U.S. charges were based on one FBI agent, and suggested the U.S. was seeking them for political reasons — to use them as a pawn in the investigation into alleged Russian hacking in the U.S. election. They claimed in the courtroom that they were twice approached by U.S. authorities — in November and in February — in the absence of their previous lawyer. They said they urged them to falsely testify that they were cooperating in the hacking attack on the Democratic National Committee ordered by Russian authorities. They said U.S. authorities would, in exchange, give them money and a life in the United States. "I rejected doing it," Nikulin said.
Let's be honest: All parties involved have good reasons to lie about this case. Nikulin obviously doesn't want to be shipped to the US—regardless of the crimes he's been accused of—and we imagine they have nothing to lose by claiming that the extradition request is politically motivated.
But was they really offered a deal by the feds if they confessed to hacking the DNC? We wouldn't be surprised. And the FBI has a long track record of using this kind of tactics to tie up loose ends.
We guess the moral of this story is: The DNC hacking allegations have become so absurd that they've even found their way into the extradition case of a 29-year-old trapped in Prague.
The other moral of this story: Never cut deals with the FBI.
From their parents, of course. Tina Fortune, of Florida, is a divorced mother of three. We've watched a few of their videos, and we've concluded they are a normal, level-headed person! They discuss family and parenting with reason and experience, which is actually something worth noting in the context of parents who upload videos of their kids to YouTube, because a good 89 percent of them should have their children taken away. That positive impression was reinforced here, in a chat with their son Mansir, who thinks the idea of a woman marrying another woman is “nasty.” But Tina doesn't want their son judging other people like that. They ask where they learned gay relationships are “nasty.” Nowhere in particular, they say; they just knows. So it couldn't possibly be from their own mother, right?
Wrong.
Because Tina, who says “we love all people and we don't judge people,” also reminds Mansir (and viewers, in the Chyron) they want them to marry a girl. It's the “not in my backyard mentality.” I'm fine with gays, just so long as my kids aren't! That isn't a message of “not judging”; it's a message of “don't be different.” Who knows what Mansir, or any little boy or girl, will grow up to be. But while it's commendable to raise children with a “don't judge” attitude, the whole effort is undermined when you tell your kid “don't be like that.” As if they have a choice in the matter.
And yes, we noticed the giant cross in the background.

THE minister in charge of the Government's web censorship plan has been caught out censoring their own website.
The front page of Communications Minister Stephen Conroy's official website displays a list of topics connected to their portfolio, along with links to more information about each one.
All the usual topics are there – cyber safety, the national broadband network, broadcasters ABC and SBS, digital television and so on.
All except one.
It was revealed today a script within the minister's homepage deliberately removes references to internet filtering from the list.
In the function that creates the list, or "tag cloud", there is a condition that if the words "ISP filtering" appear they should be skipped and not displayed.
The discovery is unlikely to do any favours for Senator Conroy's web filtering policy, which has been criticised for its secrecy.
According to Google's cache records, the exception has been included on the minister's homepage since at least February 14.
A message on the page says it was last updated in October last year.
Melbourne web developer David Johnson told news.com.au the code was intended to remove references to internet filtering.
"The code is a quick fix," said Mr Johnson of creative agency Lemonade.
"If the developers of the minister's site had wanted to do it properly they would have placed the 'ISP filtering' keyword exclusion on the server side where it is inaccessible to the public, instead of the front-end code which can be seen by anyone and understood by people with even a basic knowledge of scripting."
The function, written in web scripting language Javascript, appears to have been first discovered by a user on the Whirlpool broadband discussion forum.
Senator Conroy's office has been contacted for comment.

A roll call of those who died in the MH17 air disaster and a procession to the crash site have marked the first anniversary of the tragedy over eastern Ukraine, in which 298 people died.
Victims were remembered in a village close to where the airliner came down, and in the Netherlands and Australia.
At some memorials, relatives clutched sunflowers - a symbol of the Ukrainian field where the bodies were found.
Pro-Russian rebels are widely believed to have shot down the Malaysian plane.
Russia denies this, blaming Ukrainian government forces for the disaster in the eastern Donetsk region.

A memorial service was held in a church in Hrabove, the village nearest the crash site, after which people processed to a newly unveiled memorial plaque to the victims.
Around 300 people attended the ceremony at the crash site.
The mourners, mainly women and children, carried flowers and icons and chanted Orthodox liturgical music. The perimeter of the procession was guarded by men in Soviet military uniforms, the Associated Press news agency reports.
In the Netherlands, which lost 193 victims, flags flew at half mast and flowers were laid at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport from where Malaysia Airlines flight to Kuala Lumpur took off.
About 2,000 people including Prime Minister Mark Rutte attended a service for the families in Nieuwegein, in which the names of all 298 victims were read out.
Asmaa Aljuned, the wife of co-pilot Ahmad Hakimi, spoke of the suffering of the bereaved - each "a whole different journey in its entirety. And for that my heart bleeds yet again".
They ended their tribute with the words their husband never had the chance to say: "Thanks for flying with us and have a nice day."

There was no sign of white roses or carnations outside this memorial; instead the relatives came clutching sunflowers. A striking reminder that many of the bodies were found strewn in fields bursting with the vivid yellow flowers.
Two out of three of the victims were Dutch. Such was the impact of the crash, many people in this country now refer to the 17th of July as the Netherlands' 9/11.
Inside the formal events centre, LED lights were switched on, one for each of the 298 people who were on board. Their names were read out, with love and pain, by the people they left behind.
A minute's silence was held at the exact moment one year ago today that flight MH17 lost contact with air traffic control.

Sunflower mementoes for the families
Earlier on Friday, family and friends of the 38 Australians lost in the crash gathered for a memorial service at Parliament House in Canberra.
Wreaths and flowers were laid before a newly unveiled plaque with the names of the victims, which has been placed in the garden and set in soil that was brought back from Ukraine by an Australian police officer.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke of the "innocent people living their lives to the full... shot out of the sky in a war of aggression by one country against a smaller neighbour."
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop read a message from Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris, whose three children - Evie, Mo and Otis - were killed alongside their grandfather Nick Norris.
"Our family was an innocent victim of a faraway war. They were killed by other people's anger," they said. "We try not to become involved in what we see as a devastating surge of sadness, suffering and anger in the world today."

In Malaysia, a memorial service was held in Kuala Lumpur on 11 July - because the anniversary of the disaster comes at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which is traditionally a holiday. Each victim was named and then honoured with a moment of silence.
'Politicised coverage'
Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, who will attend a service in Kiev, said on Friday it was a "moral duty" to find out who was behind the downing of the plane.

Mr Poroshenko reaffirmed their support for a UN tribunal to prosecute the suspects - something which has also been called for by the UK, Australia, the Netherlands and Malaysia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday rejected the idea, calling it "premature and counter-productive" and criticised what they called the "clearly politicised" coverage by Western media of the disaster.

The Department of Justice has wrapped up its civil rights investigation into the Baltimore police; the 163-page report of the agency's findings is expected to be released on Wednesday, and it appears to be damning. The city's police force was found to flout the constitutional rights of Baltimore's predominantly black residents, making unlawful stops and using excessive force.
Here's more on what the scathing DOJ report found via the Baltimore Sun:
The investigators found that “supervisors have issued explicitly discriminatory orders, such as directing a shift to arrest ‘all the black hoodies' in a neighborhood.” They also found that black residents were more likely to be stopped and searched as pedestrians and drivers even though police were more likely to find illegal guns, illicit drugs and other contraband on white residents. Police practices in Baltimore “perpetuate and fuel a multitude of issues rooted in poverty and race, focusing law enforcement actions on low-income, minority communities” and encourage officers to have “unnecessary, adversarial interactions with community members,” the report said…
The report noted that officers recorded more than 300,000 pedestrian stops from January 2010 to May 2015. Roughly 44 percent were made in two small, predominantly African-American districts that contain 11 percent of the city's population, and seven black men were stopped more than 30 times each.
The DOJ investigation was initiated following the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray while in police custody and the report is the next step in the process of a wider Justice Department effort to enact policing reforms in the city. Similar investigations have taken place in Ferguson, Missouri, following the 2014 killing of Michael Brown, as well as in dozens of other cities.
I've loved the work of Jim Henson my entire life, and it seems like each year my appreciation of their creativity grows more and more. Even with their life being cut tragically short, their body of work is huge. As you could tell from our Muppet podcast last week, everyone has different parts of Muppet history that they remember the most, and there are plenty of pieces to pick up on later in life and enjoy for the first time. For me, Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas is one of the pieces of Muppet history that I didn't see much as a kid, but now love as an adult.
There are a lot more dedicated Emmet Otter fans than me out there, but I recently did some digging, learning as much as I could about the special and comparing home video versions, so I thought I'd share the love a little bit.
Behind the Scenes
Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas started as a book by Russell Hoban in 1971. It caught the attention of Jim Henson, who looked at it as an opportunity to dabble in more realistic animal puppets than previous Muppet projects allowed. Henson and crew set up shop in Toronto and built a huge, elaborate set that included a river and a main street that made up Frogtown Hollow. The set was “built up” to allow the puppeteers to work under the puppets (like most Muppet productions before) but in a scale that the Henson crew hadn't attempted before.
The story revolves around Alice and Emmet Otter, poor but lovable critters that long to do something nice for each other for Christmas, and set about to do just that in a story inspired by Gift of the Magi. Emmet and their friends form a jug-band to win the local Christmas talent show in order to get Alice a piano, while Emmet's mom enters themselves to get their son the used guitar they saw in the music shop window. They each do a great job, but they're up against the Riverbottom Nightmare Band, a group of ruffians led by Chuck the Bear. They're an edgy hard rock band and they upstage all the other acts and win the show.
This special marked the first collaboration between the songwriter Paul Williams and The Muppets aside from Williams' appearance on the Muppet Show in 1976. They would go on to write many of the classic Muppet songs from the later films. The special premiered on HBO in 1977, and was later shown on ABC in 1980.
The Legacy
Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas was very well received and has since become a classic. It was never part of my nostalgia, but I remembered seeing it when I was younger. I sought it out a few years ago and now it's part of my yearly Christmas special-watching traditions. Jim Henson created a world with Emmet Otter that feels real and lived in, and the crew did an amazing job technically. You were impressed the first time you saw Kermit ride a bike, but imagine seeing Emmet and Alice otter row a boat across a river while singing a song, or The Riverbottom Nightmare Band speeding through town in their convertible. If I had watched this a lot as a kid, I would have just believed Frogtown Hollow was real.
Speaking of Kermit riding their bike, they do just that in the beginning of Emmet Otter, playing the role of narrator. Along with Kermit's appearance at the end of the special, this is why there is no complete version of the special on home video. If you browse the reviews of any version of Emmet Otter on DVD, you'll hear from many people who seem confused when they pop in their copy to find that it's been edited from the version they remember as a kid.
Thankfully there are enterprising fans out there, like Philfrog, who edited their own version of the special from various sources to create a complete edit for Muppet Geeks like me. The DVDs you can buy and the version that is on Netflix is edited heavily. Kermit is completely gone, as are some lines of dialog and some entire songs. I watched all the versions I could get my hands on, and Philfrog's edit is my favorite, and the quality is great.
The benefit about the official DVD is that it includes a one-hour documentary about the production, so if you're a Henson purist you might want to go ahead and pick it up.
I'm rowin', where's the singing?
Even though I didn't watch it much as a kid, Emmet Otter's Jub-Band Christmas is one of my favorite specials now. It's unique, it's got that Jim Henson touch that makes it special, and it's got some good music and fun visuals. You don't have to be a Muppet snob like me to enjoy it, so watch it on Netflix or Amazon Instant, buy the DVD, acquire the Philfrog edit, do whatever, just make sure you watch it this Christmas season.

So recently I left the world of Desktop PCs (at home at least) and bought myself a luscious 15″ Retina Macbook Pro. The 2nd thing I installed was Mono (the 1st was Windows 7 natch!).
Why a Mac?
I've been using Windows since Windows 95 and had every home version of the OS since – including ME and Vista. And I've enjoyed them all. Windows 8 has changed that (although I technically own a licence to that too – what can I say – I'm a sucker). Theres no way I can stick with that OS for the next 4 years…….
The sounds from Microsoft are clear – .NET is second class. You want performance – use C++. You want productivity – use HTML+JS. Anders recent focus on the Javascript++, sorry Typescript, and MS failing to promote F# adequately (not the F# team, who promote anything and everything relevant about F# – the rest of MS seem to want to keep it quiet it feels like) – probably as it's developed in Cambridge (UK) and not back in the US, so isn't very well understood.
Add into the mix my 1 year old son, whose fascination with my desktop PC and swinging from its DVD drives, and the space it takes which is far more useful as toy storage – a new laptop was in order.
Apple was immediately in the running. 2880×1800 was why. Nothing else. I'd buy that. My iPad 3 screen was stunning – imaging writing code on a screen that nice. I hesitated though. As a long time Windows user I spent a long time looking for a high spec Dell or HP or anything that could come close. Every time I managed to spec something close a weird thing happened – it was more expensive than the Macbook Pro Retina. At least on a Mac I could install Windows and have macOS as a second OS.
I caved in last month (Christmas coming and that desk space was reserved for a brand-new trike). I really wanted to give macOS a shot tho, so I installed Mono and MonoDevelop straight away.
Piversion
Mono on a Mac wasn't my first shot at using Mono. I also bought myself a Raspberry Pi this year.
A 700Mhz ARM CPU and 256Mb RAM for £25 was simply too tempting. I had to have one. On release there were no OSes to support its hardware floating point unit so all software used software floating point emulation – on an already slow 700Mhz CPU it was painful. But (for fun) I ran a Raytracer I'd written in F# on it to see how it compared to my home Q6600 and my work's i7. More on the result later.
Back to Mac
So that same Raytracer I ran on the Windows part of my Mac. A simple scene at 1280×720 – 2 spheres and a plane with 3 lights. No fancy features – just ray hits surface, ray reflects, recurse. It ran in < 1 second. 1.5 times faster than my work i7 and 2.5 times faster than my Q6600 it was replacing.
Booting in macOS I re-ran the test in Mono. 5 minutes 30 seconds. Around 330 times slower than the same exe on the same hardware. Just the OS and the runtime differed.
My heart sank. I love F#. I love C# (less). I didn't buy a Mac to do Objective-C. I just wanted decent hardware to write .NET flavoured code on. And I sort of wanted the OS to be macOS. I'd just assumed that Mono would be fast enough on such sweet hardware.
Oh and by the way – that same exe running in software on a Raspberry Pi on Mono – 10 minutes. Only half the speed of the 2.6Ghz i7 with 16GB of RAM. My dream of ditching out of Windows and using Mono on Mac was starting to look a lot like it was a really poor choice. I started thinking I'd have been better off buying 2 Pi's and saving the best part of 2 and a half grand.
Social (In)etiquette
So I tweeted this:
“F# Raytracer on Win7 MBPr – ~1sec Under Mono on macOS – 5:30. Minutes. 330 times slower on exact same hardware. Boo!”
I hadn't hash-tagged it or aimed it at anyone. It was my attempt to cry about a sufficiently large duff purchase to my 50 or so followers (for them to ignore). But someone read it and added Miguel De Icaza to a retweet. Suddenly I started getting tweets from Miguel asking for code snippets and samples.
At this point I kinda felt like I'd hurt their feelings – their tweets sounded that way. After a quick round of tweets they reveal that Mono 3 defaults to the old garbage collector and that if I used the new garbage collector I'd get speeds *much* closer to .NET. I already knew I had GC issues on .NET – the profiler in VS2012 told me I had a large number of collections – something I worked around on .NET by switching off concurrent GC. Mono's older GC simply magnified the issue.
I'd simply typed at a terminal
mono RaytracerFSharp.exe
and complained when it didn't work the way I expected first time. I should have tried more options before venting.
For reference Miguel also tweeted this – clearly aimed at me:
Pro-Tip: If you are using Task Parallel Library or using lots of threads with Mono on OSX, make sure you use SGen, or suffer the pain.
At least I wasn't going to regret the Mac now, even with egg on my face.
Mono Rocks
It's not perfect, but it is great. Here's why:
It exists. Despite everyone saying when it started that MS would shut it down and sue anyone using it – it's still here. They care. It's their whole business. They monetize it with MonoTouch/Droid/Mac. The creation the free stuff with it and for it. While it feels like MS are busy firing up the furnaces to throw .NET in, Miguel and their team are planning a daring rescue. And it looks more and more likely that it may work. Even more recent MS castoffs are getting new leases of life on Mono – think XNA/Monogame. They really care. Had I tweeted that .NET performance sucked would MS have asked for samples? Heck even if you send samples to MS you're likely to be ignored. If you're lucky on a public forum you might get a handy tip from a passionate team member, but largely you're ignored by the masses – except, of course the wonderful F# team who have always been super reactive to my team at work. Miguel answering is almost like Steve Balmer replying to a tweet on a .NET issue.
All Apologies
So apologies to the Mono team for my initially (but also unintentionally) rude tweet. Thanks for the help and the continued work. I'll continue to use and enjoy it and stop whinging about it.
PS
Any news on making Mono work with HardFP on the Raspberry Pi 🙂

“So do not weaken and do not grieve, for you will indeed be superior if you are truly believers.” [1]
This verse was revealed to the Messenger (SAS) by Allah The Almighty from above the Seven Heavens, soon after the Muslims suffered a defeat in the Battle of Uhud and returned to Al-Madinah dejected and downtrodden. It was revealed as an encouragement to the believers after a victory that was in their grasp, was snatched away from them and turned into a defeat. And why should the Companions (RA) not have felt devastated at this defeat? Seventy of the best human beings on Earth at the time were killed and countless others were injured. Even the Messenger (SAS) themselves was seriously wounded until blood flowed from their face and they said in great anguish whilst wiping the blood from their noble cheeks: “Allah's Wrath is Great upon the people who besmeared Their Messenger's face with blood.”
However, this defeat was only a temporary setback so that the believers could reflect upon the reasons for the defeat, described in successive verses of Surah Ale-Imran. The mistakes and sins of a few believers had deprived the whole army of victory.
When Umar bin Al-Khattab (RA) despatched the army of Saad bin Abi Waqqas (RA) to the Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah, they advised him: “Fear your sins more than you fear the enemy as your sins are more dangerous to you than your enemy. We Muslims are only victorious over our enemy because their sins outnumber ours, not for any other reason. If our sins were equal to those of our enemy, then they would defeat us due to their superior numbers and resources.”
And so Saad (RA) proceeded to fight the Persians and, sticking to the advice of their leader, they imprisoned the alcoholic Abu Mahjan Ath-Thaqafi lest their presence in the army delays the victory. Until, Abu Mahjan lamented in their shackles and composed verses of poetry that touched the wife of Saad (RA) to temporarily release them so that they could participate in the battle with their brothers. Abu Mahjan thus went out riding the horse of Saad (RA) (as Saad (RA) was bedridden with fever) and performed unmatched feats of valour before returning to their cell in the evening and wearing their shackles back by himself. This continued for three days until, when Saad (RA) found out about the heroics of Abu Mahjan, they untied their shackles with the words: “By Allah! I will never imprison you again for drinking alcohol!” Upon this, Abu Mahjan replied, “By Allah! I will never again touch alcohol after this day!” The army was victorious and Saad (RA) appointed the ascetic Companion Salman Al-Farsi (RA) as the new ruler of Persia, who lived on a meagre salary of one dirham per day.
Victory and defeat, gains and losses, and successes and setbacks are not decided by money, resources, numbers or skills. Rather, they are decided by the balance of obedience and disobedience of Allah The Exalted. The more we obey Allah, both individually and collectively, the more we hasten Their Victory. The more we disobey Allah, the more we delay the arrival of Their Victory. One Muslim's sins can delay the victory for everyone. It is very easy to blame Bush and Blair, the ‘West', the ‘kuffar' or simply ‘them' for all our woes and worries. But it is not so easy to look in the mirror and point the finger at ourselves.
Look at us and our pathetic state. We have abandoned Salah or we delay it or rush through it. We are too stingy to give Zakah, let alone optional charity. We prefer to go on holiday than to go for the obligatory Hajj. We drink alcohol, we use and supply drugs (Muslims are amongst the biggest suppliers of drugs in the world today), we cohabit outside wedlock, we steal, we cheat. We eat haram, earn haram and sell haram. We beat our wives and force our daughters into marriages then use Islam to justify it. We are quick to spend on fashion and luxuries but slow to spend on orphans and the needy. We fail to utter a single word, let alone raise a finger, when we see our fellow Muslims imprisoned , tortured, house-arrested, extradited or slain for fear of being ‘linked' to them. We waste our lives watching television and playing computer games then complain that we don't have enough time to become better Muslims. We are too addicted to music to find time to listen to or memorise the Quran. We are too busy in fun and games to fulfil our responsibilities as vicegerents on Allah's Earth. And after all this (and more), we have the audacity to wonder why Allah's Victory has not yet arrived. With our paltry state, we should more likely expect Allah's Wrath and Punishment rather than Their Victory.
Every sin we commit delays the arrival of Allah's Victory. Every Salah we delay extends the incarceration of a captive at Guantanamo Bay. Every drug we take allows another Quran to be flushed down the toilet. Every hour we waste watching TV allows another Muslim to be kidnapped and extradited into the hands of savage beasts. Every time we gaze at something forbidden, we place an obstacle in the path of Allah's Victory. A sin is not a ‘private matter between me and Allah' but one sin can make the difference between victory and defeat. Every sin we commit is one more reason why Allah should not grant us relief, safety and victory.
Allah has made us a Promise in the asupervisorstioned verse: “So do not weaken and do not grieve, for you will indeed be superior if you are truly believers.” They promise us relief, assistance, superiority and victory on the condition that we are true believers. If we suffer defeats today then it does not mean that Allah's Promise is false. Instead, the question we must ask ourselves is: are we truly believers?
WASHINGTON — When President Trump signed a $1.1 trillion spending bill on Friday, they zeroed in on a tiny sliver of it, suggesting that they might disregard $20 million in funding for loan subsidies and other aid to historically black universities.
Two nights later, after a storm of criticism, the White House walked back the threat in a statement that declared the president's “unwavering support” for such schools.
But the two days in between left some African-American educators feeling used, many black politicians enraged and some demanding that Mr. Trump back their “unwavering support” with a show of budgetary support. It also, once again, revealed a White House where one team does not necessarily know what another team is up to.
“I worked to make sure there was clarity because I observed that there was feedback and some were misconstruing the signing statement,” Omarosa Manigault, a close aide to Mr. Trump, said in an interview on Monday. Ms. Manigault headed Mr. Trump's outreach to black voters during their presidential campaign and had publicly promised that their budget would protect historically black colleges and universities.
Good day, fellow apex predators! Today I do a bit of math-hammering to figure out why it is that my Tactical Squads perform so poorly on the tabletop. While I am using Tactical Marines in my calculations, I believe much of what I'm about to write could hold true for a lot of elite infantry units.
If you've read my last post, you will already know I'm in a bit of a sour mood lately as far as 40k is concerned. Aside from the issues I brought up in that maudlin essay, one thing that has bugged me a lot is how badly the infantry in my army (Space Marines, in case you weren't tracking) has been performing – and Tactical Squads chief amongst those.
Now, don't get me wrong: not ALL Marine infantry sucks. Scouts, for example, are a great unit – though even then, the reason they are good has a lot more to do with the impact they have over your overall survivability (by denying a huge amount of real estate for enemy Deep Strikers) than with any other intrinsic qualities the unit possesses.
Tactical Marines have long been one of my favourite units – at least conceptually. In practice, though, they have pretty much always been kind of (or a lot) lackluster. For a brief period in 7th Edition, the Battle Company meta-detachment made them shine, and that was only because it piled on SO MANY special rules unto the humble squad that it was almost impossible not to do well with them.
These days, that's all gone, and we find ourselves in a new meta that is dominated by horde/chaff infantry. Conscripts held the crown of best chaff unit for a while, but Cultists, Poxwalkers and Brimstone Horrors have also been doing pretty well. Meanwhile, my Tactical Marines have been really struggling… and I think I understand why.
“Well, they just cost too much, duh!”
Well yes, of course. After all, anything can be good if it's costed appropriately. The more interesting question is: why? What is it that makes them overcosted? That is what I'll attempt to elucidate for you.
Tactical Squads are pretty basic. What I mean by that is they don't really do anything special: they can't deep-strike, or infiltrate, or move rapidly, or cast Smite, or fight twice in the Fight Phase. Ergo, getting their point cost right doesn't necessitate taking into account a lot of complex variables. Indeed, it pretty much comes down to how survivable they are, and how much damage they can push out. While And They Shall Know No Fear is a thing, bear in mind that Tactical Squads usually operate in 5-man squads; ergo, it doesn't really warrant too much of a thought because its impact is limited.
With all of that in mind, I'm going to compare them to Infantry Squads, because their overall mechanics are similar (i.e. they shoot things and then die) – the big difference is that Infantry Squads are just do it a lot better overall. I initially wanted to compare them to Conscripts but with the Chapter Approved points change, I think Infantry Squads are probably going to be seeing a lot more play than ‘Scripts.
On the damage-dealing front, things are bad straight off the bat:
At 24 inches, a Guardsman firing at a Predator (T7, 3+ AS) causes 0.0069 Wounds per Point (hereafter referred to as WPP for brevity's sake): 1 shot, hitting 50% of the time, wounding 16% of the time and going through the tank's armour 33% of the time will do 0.027 wounds, which is then divided by the model's cost (4 points), giving us 0.0069 WPP.
At the same range, a Tactical Marine will cause 0.0056 WPP to the vehicle: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 33% of the time and defeating the tank's armour 33% of the time causes 074 wounds, which is then divided by the model's cost (13 points), giving us 0.0056 WPP.
If you're even the least bit good at math, you will have already calculated that the Guardsman does over 20% more Wounds per Point that a Tactical Marine against the Predator.
“Well, so what? It's not like shooting at tanks is what Bolters are supposed to be good at, anyways!”
True, but the bad news is that it only goes downhill from here:
At 24 inches, a Guardsman firing at a Chaos Marine (T4, 3+ AS) will cause 0.0138 WPP: 1 shot hitting 50% of the time, wounding 33% of the time and going through the armour 33% of the time will cause 0.055 wounds. Divided by model cost of 4 points leaves us with 0.0138 WWP.
At the same range, a Tactical Marine will cause 0.0085 WPP to their heretical counterpart: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 50% of the time and going through the filthy corrupted armour 33% of time will cause 0.111 wounds; divided by 13 points, we get 0.0085 WPP.
So, that's over 60% more WPP against the Chaos Marine for the Imperial Guardsman. Ouch.
“Hmm… well ok, that's bad, but bolters have always been best at shredding light infantry anyways!”
Hang on to your hat, my friend!
At 24 inches, a Guardsman firing at another Guardsman will cause 0.0416 WPP: 1 shot hitting 50% of the time, wounding 50% of the time and going through the armour 66% of the time will cause 0.166 wound, which is then divided by the model's cost of 4 points = 0.0416 WPP.
At the same range, a Tactical Marine will cause 0.0227 WPP: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 66% of the time and going through the armour 66% of the time, divided by a model cost of 13 pts = 0.0227 WWP.
That is over 80% more WPP in favour of the Guardsman! Holy smokes!
“Well, ok, Tacticals don't do a lot of damage, but at least they are durable, right?”
Are they really, though? Let's take a look:
A 4-points Guardsman will suffer 0.66 WPP from a Chaos Cultist (BS 4+) firing an autogun (S3 Ap0) at them from 24 inches away: 1 shot hitting 50% of the time, wounding 50% of the time and bypassing the flak armour 66% of time will cause 0.16 wounds, which is then multiplied by the model's cost (4 points), giving us 0.66 WPP suffered.
A 13-points Tactical Marine will suffer 0.72 WPP from the same Chaos Cultist: 1 shot hitting 50% of the time, wounding 33% of the time, bypassing the Marine's armour 33% will cause 0.05 wounds, which multiplied by 13 (points), gives us 0.72 WPP.
So the Tactical Marine will suffer about 8% more WPP than the Guardsman will in this instance. That's unbalanced but within the realm of the tolerable. The thing is that once again, that's just the tip of the iceberg…
When shot at by a Chaos Marine (BS 3+) wielding a Boltgun (S4 Ap 0), our Guardsman loses 1.18 WPP: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 66% of the time and bypassing the Guardsman's armour 66% of the time causes 0.29 wounds, which multiplied by 4 points gives us 1.18 WPP.
In the same situation, our Tactical Marine will suffer 1.44 WPP: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 50% of the time and bypassing power armour 33% of the time will cause 0.11 wounds, which multiplied by 13 points gives 1.44 WPP.
In this scenario, our Tactical Marines suffer over 20% more WPP than the Guardsman! And if you think that's bad, just wait when we introduce a weapon with a good AP into the mix!
When shot by a Tempestus Scion Stormtrooper (BS 3+) with a Plasmagun (S7 Ap -3), a Guardsman will suffer 2.22 WPP: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 83% of the time and completing negating their armour will cause 0.55 wounds. Multiplied by 4 points gives us 2.22 WPP.
Stormtrooper (BS 3+) with a Plasmagun (S7 Ap -3), a Guardsman will suffer 2.22 WPP: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 83% of the time and completing negating their armour will cause 0.55 wounds. Multiplied by 4 points gives us 2.22 WPP. In the same situation, our Tactical Marine will lose 4.81 WPP: 1 shot hitting 66% of the time, wounding 66% of the time and bypassing the armour 83% of the time will cause 0.37 wounds. Multiplied by 13 gives us 4.81 WPP.
That is a whopping 216% more WPP when shot by the (not even overcharged) plasmagun! Sweet Lord Almighty!
So in summary, you have a unit that not only does less damage per point than a unit of Guardsman does, but it also extremely vulnerable to high AP weapons will still being worse against standard small arms.
Now, if only the special and heavy weapons the Tacticals had access to were able to compensate for the disparity in cost effectiveness of the basic models, one could argue that said disparity wouldn't matter. Unfortunately, the Infantry Squad's plasmagun is more than 45% cheaper than the Tactical Squad's while only hitting 25% less. The Lascannon is less advantageously priced at a 20% discount while still hitting 25% less, but say you take both a plasmagun and lascannon, the equivalent Tactical Squad will spend a combined 48% more on a combi-plas and lascannon for only a 33% increase damage output.
Where is the silver lining supposed to be? Krak Grenades?
Now, as I said, this article looked at the math behind Tactical Squad in detail, but a lot of the same can be said of a fair bit of the game's elite infantry. Indeed, pretty much all of the Marine infantry falls into that category (lol Assault Marines) and without having run the math, Eldar Dire Avengers seem pretty pricy at 12 points a pop. Hopefully, someone at GW is going to take a long hard look at how these are costed and make some changes, but given that Chapter Approved 2017 just came and went, we may have to wait a while…

A federal judge in New Orleans, Louisiana, has blocked a six-month federal moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf.
Several dozen plaintiffs had sued President Barack Obama's administration, arguing the ban would create long-term economic harm to their businesses. Obama ordered the moratorium after the April 20 explosion of an oil rig off Louisiana that killed 11 people and triggered an underwater oil gusher.
White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs says the government will immediately appeal the ruling to the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
"The president strongly believes, as the Department of Interior and Department of Justice argued yesterday, that continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened is - does not make any sense and puts the safety of those involved, potentially puts safety of those on the rigs, and the safety of the environment and the Gulf at a danger that the president does not believe we can afford right now," Gibbs said.

It may have been the low point in Canadian soccer history.
And, much to their annoyance, David Edgar remembers it all too well.
On October 16, 2012, Canada's senior men's national went into Honduras knowing a single point was all they needed to advance to the Hex – the final stage of World Cup qualifying in the CONCACAF region – for the first time since 1997. They had the hopes of a nation riding on their shoulders.
Those hopes were quickly shattered.
Despite creating some early chances, Canada saw their World Cup dreams come to a crushing end with an 8-1 defeat in San Pedro Sula. Fast forward four years, and Canada returns to the scene of the crime on Friday with similar stakes (2 p.m. PT on TSN).
It's not quite do-or-die this time, but picking up a point – or more – would give Canada every chance of advancing to the Hex heading into their group stage finale next week at BC Place.
“You see what the women's team did with back-to-back bronze medals and that's fantastic,” Edgar said. “Now it's the men's team. It's our opportunity to help raise the profile of the game in Canada. We've said all along, we need to get into the Hex. And we've got a massive opportunity to do that.”
The top two teams from each group will advance to the Hex.
In Group A, Mexico is already through with 12 points. That leaves Honduras (four points), Canada (four points), and El Salvador (two points) fighting for the final spot. There are still several different scenarios that could transpire – it's possible Canada could even advance with a pair of draws.
The moral of the story is that Canada controls their own destiny – just as they did four years ago.
Edgar, who Whitecaps FC acquired in July, is one of six players on Canada's current roster that featured in that 8-1 defeat. Their Whitecaps FC and Canadian national team teammate Marcel de Jong was also on the roster but did not play in the game.
It was a difficult time for everyone involved.
“I remember getting back and going for lunch with my mom, and just sort of shutting off,” Edgar said. “I didn't want to see anything, I didn't want to see what was said, the news, or anything. It was a tough one to take. We were that close. And we knew what we needed to do. It was just one of those that may never and hopefully will never happen again in my career.”
Edgar, a native of Kitchener, Ontario, is one of the more experienced players on Canada's roster, having represented the senior national team 37 times. In their last two appearances back in June, they wore the captain's armband and started in central midfield, which could happen again in these next two matches with Will Johnson and Julian de Guzman (injury) not on the squad.
“Everyone knows how important playing for Canada is for me,” Edgar was quoted as saying on Yahoo.com. “If I can help the team qualify for the next round, I'll do it. If I have to play left wing, I'll play left wing. All that matters to me is that we get to the Hex.”
Following the Honduras match, Canada concludes the group stage next Tuesday, September 6 vs. El Salvador at BC Place. It will be Canada's third straight home match in Vancouver, after a 1-0 victory over Honduras last November and a 3-0 defeat vs. Mexico in March.
A record crowd of 54,798 packed BC Place on that night.
“After that, the word in the dressing room to each other was, ‘We want to be back here,'” said Edgar, who now lives just down the road from BC Place with their wife and daughter.
“We love the atmosphere, we love the setup, and we got our wish. The federation has done everything to accommodate us in that. It's down to us now to make it, bring it home now and create a bit of a party atmosphere come that Tuesday night.”

The BBC has captured incredible underwater footage of an octopus collecting the halves of a coconut shell in Indonesia to use as protection at a later date.
In the clip, a flounder is following the veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) as it scuttles to find the second half of a coconut shell. Although the video seems to suggest the flounder is about to stir up trouble, it is more likely trailing the octopus for a very different reason.
“The flounder is definitely not a predator of the octopus,” said Dr. Jennifer Mather, a professor at the University of Lethbridge who studies octopus cognition, to IFLScience. “But fish often follow octopuses out hunting. The octopus is going to ‘scare up' escaping small animals that the flounder can catch.”
The octopus is a soft-bodied creature that is vulnerable to many predators, including fish and marine mammals. And out on the open seafloor, there is often no place to hide, so this octopus is carrying the coconut shells around as protection.
"Tool use per se doesn't indicate intelligence, there are some fairly automatic manipulations that fit the definition," said Mather. "But what does show intelligence is the planning that octopuses use, and the variety of situations they adapt to. So the octopus that carried around the coconut shell must have anticipated that it would need it later, dug it out of the sand and carried it around until it was ready to rest.”

TORONTO — The Toronto Raptors have signed free-agent guard Brady Heslip.
The native of Burlington, Ont., is a member of the Canadian men's senior national team. They spent the 2015-16 season with Acqua Vitasnella Cantu in Italy, averaging 12.7 points and shooting .455 from three-point range in 29 games.
They averaged 13.0 points and 1.2 rebounds for Canada at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto and 10.7 points, 1.3 rebounds and 1.4 assists at the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship in Mexico City.
Heslip was selected 11th overall by Reno in the 2014 NBA D-League Draft and averaged 24.5 points in 20 games with the Bighorns. They set an NBA D-League record by making 13 three-point field goals Nov. 29, 2014 at Idaho as part of a 45-point performance.'
Prior to turning professional, Heslip spent three years at Baylor University and was a key part of the Bears' run the quarter-finals of the 2012 NCAA men's basketball championship.
Toronto will open training camp Sept. 27 in Vancouver. The roster stands at 20 players.
Advertising Age Player
Dannon is sacking aging heartthrob John Stamos in favor of rising Carolina Panthers star Cam Newton, who will be featured in a campaign for a new NFL-branded Greek yogurt targeting men.
The yogurt is called Oikos Triple Zero, a reference to the protein-packed product having "zero added sugar, zero artificial sweeteners and zero fat," according to Dannon. Mr. Stamos starred in ads for the regular Oikos brand in recent years. They appeared in Super Bowl ads in 2012 and 2014, when they were joined by other former "Full House" stars Bob Saget and Dave Coulier.
"We have ended our relationship with John Stamos. We had a great run with him," said Art D'Elia, Dannon's VP-marketing overseeing Oikos. But they added that "we wanted a spokesperson and an advertising model that could help us appeal more to males and that's why we made the decision … to move away from John."
The new TV ad starring Mr. Newton is by Y&R, Barcelona and will break on Jan. 5 on NFL Network. Ads will also run during the NFC and AFC championship games later in the month. But Dannon does not plan to return to the Super Bowl, Mr. D'Elia said. One reason is that the marketer did not want to wait until February to start advertising the new product. "Retailers are really looking for performance in the first eight to 12 weeks. So it's important to get out of the gate strong with media to drive awareness and trial," they said.
Yogurt marketers are searching for new growth opportunities for Greek as the category begins to mature after several years of sizzling sales. "This is a category that historically has really been marketed primarily to females," Mr. D'Elia said. As a result, male buyers account for only 37% of total Greek yogurt sales, they said. "The NFL is the largest platform that we could attach ourselves to go and broaden [the] appeal to males," they said. Mr. Newton, who guided their team to a playoff berth this season, is an "aspirational" figure, especially for young males, Mr. D'Elia said.
The strategy began earlier this year when Dannon inked a deal to become the NFL's official yogurt sponsor beginning in 2015. The pact allows for the use of the NFL shield, which is prominently displayed on Oikos Triple Zero. The yogurt will be stocked at the dining facilities of every NFL team.
Dannon will still sell regular Oikos, but Triple Zero will be the focus of the marketer's advertising in the first quarter. According to Dannon, the launch will be supported with a "multi-million dollar media investment" that includes buys on media properties with significant male reach, such as cable networks Spike and ESPN, Men's Health magazine and digital takeovers on NFL.com.
In addition to targeting men, Triple Zero seeks to seize on the growing demand for protein-rich foods. The yogurt contains 15 grams of protein per 5.3-ounce serving, which Dannon says is 25% more than regular Oikos.
Dannon is not the first yogurt brand to target males. A smaller yogurt brand called Powerful began targeting men in 2013 with a tagline that compelled consumers to "find your inner abs."
The musclebound marketing prompted Grubstreet.com to refer to the product as "brogurt."
Dannon's Mr. D'Elia described Powerful as "very narrowly targeted at a small sub-segment of men. We wanted to take a less polarizing approach with a more mainstream offering." Powerful did not respond to emails for a response. The latest version of Powerful's website and Facebook page includes images of men and women engaging in various athletic pursuits, while the yogurt is touted as "designed for the active lifestyle."
The Pokémon Company is joining forces with Nintendo Co. and Google off-shoot Niantic Inc. to develop a mobile game known as "Pokémon GO."
The upcoming free-to-play game lets players find, search, trade and even battle Pokémon in real-time.
"For the first time, Pokémon will roam free in the real world. Pokémon GO will allow players to capture Pokémon who inhabit parks, shopping areas, sidewalks and the countryside all around the world," said Niantic Inc. founder John Hanke via PC Advisor.
It is worth mentioning that Niantic Inc. has garnered critical acclaim in the world augmented-reality gaming for its hugely popular mobile MMO game "Ingress." The company's involvement with the current project has only heightened the expectations for "Pokémon GO."
"Ingress" utilizes Google Maps to place markers called "portals" on various works of art, historical sites and other public landmarks around the globe, which players can hunt for and capture. "Pokémon Go" promises to work the same way but only with Pokémon characters.
Red Bull notes that "Pokémon Go" can learn a lot from "Ingress" since the latter isn't all about taking advantage of real places, but it also has an appealing yet evolving narrative that has hooked fans since its release in 2012.
Niantic Inc. tells the story of "Ingress" through installments via in-game clips on Twitter and Facebook. There are also hidden clues on the company's website. "Pokémon Go" might use the same strategy to keep fans engaged.
Another tactic that the upcoming mobile game could employ is by having updates that not only fix issues but also add new in-game features. "Ingress" has an update that give its players the ability to create their own unique missions. "Pokémon Go" could enhance the classic albeit repetitive Pokémon battles by affording its players with a wide array of weapons and customizations for their respective Pokémon.
These considerations will undoubtedly improve the game although it still remains to be seen what "Pokémon Go" will eventually have in store.
In the meantime, it has been confirmed that the game will have a complementary, but separately sold, Bluetooth-enabled wristband called the "Pokémon GO Plus." The device blinks and vibrates whenever a Pokémon is near and lets its wearer catch the elusive Pokémon with a simple press of a button. Furthermore, it can notify players whenever Pokémon-related events are fast approaching.
Nintendo has since teased the device online.
One last look at the Pokémon Go Plus accessory #PokemonGo pic.twitter.com/61267l53cR — NintendoTweet (@NintendoTweet) September 10, 2015
"Pokémon GO" will launch as a free download from the App Store for iPhone and the Google Play Store for Android sometime in 2016.
An inflammatory “Make America Great Again” billboard was posted this week in Pearl, Mississippi.
The sign shows which shows gun pointed at African Americans.
WJTV reported:
A controversial billboard Highway 80 in Pearl is getting a lot of attention.
The billboard appears to depict a moment from the civil rights era and has the words “Make America Great Again” on it.
It's placed on a Lamar Advertising billboard. The display says that the signage was paid for by For Freedoms. It also says the billboard was not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.
The original photo dates back to 1965, to a day known as “Bloody Sunday,” according to PRNewswire. Police and protesters faced off over voting rights in Selma, Alabama.
According to For Freedoms' website, they use art to inspire deeper political engagement for citizens who want to have a greater impact on the American political landscape.
WJTV reached out to Lamar Advertising about the billboard. A spokesperson told us that since everyone is entitled to freedom of speech, they saw no issue with putting it up. They had nothing to do with the creation of the billboard.
Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott Leaders Flown to Valve
The two boycotters (shown left, flanking Valve president Gabe Newell) announced their playtest on the group's Steam page, reporting that Left 4 Dead 2 "seemed balanced and 'tight' and did not feel like a rushed job."
"What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question; and it will only get better," they said following the visit, while adding that they will not give up the boycott until their "individual concerns are addressed."
The group's official charter demands that Valve release ongoing DLC for the original Left 4 Dead, convert Left 4 Dead 2 to a free update or an expansion, and give discounts for the sequel to Left 4 Dead owners.
Despite the duo's assurance that the boycott is not over, some members took the largely complimentary report to mean that the group had been "corrupted" by Valve.
"The boycott points still stand and you guys seem to be brainwashed by Valve," said Steam user $paqhett!e!s. "Boycotters need another group."
Other users were impressed with Valve's gesture, or simply impressed with Valve's trophy.
"That is an awesome trophey [sic]," said user -=RAWR=- DaNNaZ. "Who was that guy in the middle?"

Mississippi State wide receiver De'Runnay Wilson declares for the NFL Draft via Instagram. (Photo: Joshua Lindsey-USA TODAY Sports)
STARKVILLE — De'Runnya Wilson has played their final game at Mississippi State, according multiple posts on the wide receiver's Instagram account on Friday.
Wilson, a junior, had one year of eligibility remaining.  They are the third Bulldog to declare early in the last two seasons. Running back Josh Robinson and linebacker Benardrick McKinney entered the NFL draft last year as juniors. Both were drafted.
Wilson didn't answer multiple requests for comment.

CBS Sports projects Wilson as the 10th best wide receiver in the 2016 NFL Draft. He's slotted as a second or third-round pick. CBS's Rob Rang lists Wilson's strength as their size, explosion off the line and soft hands. Wilson's weaknesses, according to Rang, include a lack of high-end speed and inability to create after the catch.
Much of Wilson's projections are based on raw talent. The Birmingham native didn't play football their sophomore an junior year of high school. Wilson arrived at Mississippi State a two-sport athlete in football and basketball. As a first-year student they played in seven games for Rick Ray's basketball team. They averaged. 0.9 points per game and and 1.6 rebounds. They blossomed on the gridiron when their focused turned solely to football.
Wilson ended their career with five catches for 96 yards and a touchdown in the Belk Bowl. They finished the year with 918 yards and 10 scores. The 10 touchdowns are the second most in a single season at Mississippi State. They caught 60 passes this season, eighth best in school history. The 918 yards rank seventh best in a season.
They joined Fred Ross as the only wideouts to post top 10 single season school records in receptions and yards in the same season.
If Wilson had returned for 2016, they likely would have held every career receiver record in school history. At worst, they would have battled Ross for those numbers.
Wilson caught 22 career touchdowns, which is second behind Chad Bumphis' 24. They gained 1,953 yards in three seasons at Mississippi State, which ranks sixth all-time. The 6-foot-5 wideout would have needed 318 yards to pass Bumphis as the program's all-time leading receiver. Thirty more receptions would have given Wilson the most in program history.

In the spring of 2008, a 27-year-old Egyptian woman named Esraa Abdel Fattah created a Facebook page to support a strike against the autocratic regime of Hosni Mubarak. The strike didn't have much impact, but the Facebook page attracted tens of thousands of followers and Abdel Fattah was soon arrested. Virtually overnight they became a symbol for a burgeoning movement of young Egyptians demanding democratic change.
Three years later, that movement touched off a revolution that ousted Mubarak and appeared to open the door to the liberal democracy those Facebook activists had dreamed of. Abdel Fattah was showered with awards from Western groups; a nongovernmental organization they headed, the Egyptian Democratic Academy, received funding from the Washington-based National Endowment for Democracy. They were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. When I saw them in Cairo in late 2011, they were eagerly preparing a monitoring operation for Egypt's first parliamentary elections.
Yet this month Abdel Fattah is one of the legions of former Egyptian democrats cheering on the military coup against the elected government of Mohamed Morsi. According to an account in the New York Times, they justified the military intervention with a burst of xenophobic hyperbole: “When terrorism is trying to take hold of Egypt and foreign interference is trying to dig into our domestic affairs, then it's inevitable for the great Egyptian people to support its armed forces against the foreign danger.”
What happened to Egypt's young liberals? Five years ago, they were the most promising movement in an Arab world dominated by strongmen like Mubarak. Now the vast majority of them are cheering another general, coup leader Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, whose beribboned image is appearing on posters around Cairo in tandem with those of former military dictators Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat.
This dizzying turnaround is unprecedented in the history of popular pro-democracy movements. Poland's Solidarity or the anti-Pinochet movement in Chile would never have dreamed of embracing their former oppressors.
In defense of Egypt's erstwhile democrats, it could be argued that they, unlike their counterparts elsewhere, had to fight on two fronts: not just against a military-backed autocracy but also against an ideological movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, that under Morsi appeared bent on monopolizing power. It's like simultaneously taking on both Pinochet and Lenin's Communist Party.
Though they ignited the 2011 revolution, the liberals were always weaker than either the army or the Brotherhood — less rich, less organized, less disciplined. And as five free elections in two years demonstrated, they had scant following among the mass of poor and rural Egyptians outside Cairo.
Once proud of their networked, leaderless structure, the liberals eventually embraced former U.N. nuclear inspector Mohamed ElBaradei as their figurehead. It was a disastrous choice: Arrogant, vain and more comfortable in a Viennese salon than a Cairo slum, ElBaradei was polling in the single digits when they withdrew from last year's presidential race.
Without their own candidate, the liberals were faced with a choice in the runoff between a military-backed candidate and the Islamist Morsi. Most chose Morsi. A delegation of youth leaders met with the Brotherhood nominee and extracted promises: Secular ministers would be included in the cabinet, and the new constitution would be forged by a consensus among secular and Islamist parties.
Morsi fulfilled some of their pledges, but their government grew steadily more insular and intolerant as it battled the lingering, Mubarak-era establishment in the bureaucracy, police and judiciary. Liberal journalists were prosecuted for “insulting the president,” and several of the revolutionary youth leaders were arrested for leading street protests.
The liberals could have waited and organized for parliamentary elections, due in a few months; polls showed the Muslim Brotherhood sinking fast. Instead, they took the easy way out and switched sides. As the Wall Street Journal reported, in the months before the coup, secular opposition leaders met regularly with Egypt's top generals, who promised that they would respond to large street demonstrations by ousting Morsi.
Once again, the liberals are saying they have extracted promises from their new partners: The constitution will be swiftly amended, and free and fair elections will follow. Drunk with the success of their “second revolution,” they have convinced themselves that the military will retreat from politics and that Egypt's Islamists will never win another election.
Meanwhile, as vice president, ElBaradei sits in a government that is holding hundreds of political prisoners incommunicado; that has shut down al-Jazeera and Islamist media; and that has gunned down scores of unarmed street protesters. It's an outcome that Esraa Abdel Fattah and their idealistic young friends never would have wished for five years ago.

Leading gay rights group are accusing Republicans of trying to rile up their conservative base by launching a whisper campaign against potential Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan -- suggesting the current Solicitor General is a closeted lesbian even though she's not.
In its first entree into the upcoming Supreme Court nomination process, the group Human Rights Campaign blasted the increasingly public discussion of Kagan's sexuality, calling it a play "straight out the right-wing playbook."
"Even though the majority of Americans couldn't care less about a nominee's sexual orientation, the far right will continue to be shameless with their whisper campaigns to drum up their base and raise money off of prejudice," Michael Cole, a spokesperson for the group emailed, in a statement to the Huffington Post
In a separate interview, Jean-Marie Navetta, spokesperson from PFLAG -- Parents, Families & Friends of Lesbians and Gays -- accused people of trying to manufacture scandal out of thin air.
"People love taking part in rumors like this, whether they're gay or not, because it implies that there's some sort of scandal going on there. And the bottom line is, it doesn't matter and it shouldn't matter," they said. "But we hear it all the time... it's a gossip point for people. And I think it could certainly be used, or be perceived to be used by some as a way to discredit [Kagan], even though we all know that it does not matter and it should not matter."
The comments come a day after CBS published a blog by Ben Domenech, a former Bush administration aide and Republican Senate staffer, in which they asserted that choosing Kagan would help Obama "please" much of their base, because they would be the "first openly gay justice." The White House reacted strongly to the assertion, relaying that Kagan is, in fact, straight. It was the first public pushback by the administration in defense of any potential Supreme Court nominee.
Even before the CBS post, a top conservative religious group was already insisting that a nominee's sexuality would play a major role in their or their confirmation process. This past week, the organization Focus on the Family abruptly reversed its position from the last Supreme Court confirmation battle by declaring it would oppose a gay Supreme Court pick, no matter who the nominee is.
"We can assure you that we recognize that homosexual behavior is a sin and does not reflect God's created intent and desire for humanity," said Tom Minnery, the group's senior vice president. "Further, we at Focus do affirm that character and moral rectitude should be key considerations in appointing members of the judiciary, especially in the case of the highest court in the land. Sexual behavior -- be it heterosexual or homosexual -- certainly lies at the heart of personal morality."
The fact that the rumor campaign surrounding Kagan has been settled doesn't necessarily mean that the issue is off the table, Republicans still seem poised to make gay rights a prominent feature of the confirmation process -- should they be chosen as Justice John Paul Stevens' replacement. Already conservative websites are latching on to a brief signed by Kagan and 40 Harvard Law School professors in which they argued that the military's "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy was discriminatory against gay troops.
Yes, first name-only basis, please. Manu has earned it, and besides, in South America, athletic heroes are honorably stripped of their surnames once they've thrilled millions and made grown men sniffle.  They are just Manu, uniting two basketball fan bases, the centerpiece of the friendly tug-of-war between two nationalities fighting for their affections.
'A beautiful player to watch'
When the gang from Buenos Aries sees them during pre-game warmups, the flag starts flapping excitedly and each and every arm reaches out, to touch him, to prepare for the hug that eventually arrives. Manu is refreshingly polite and in an era of distant and sometimes spoiled athletes, they are a man of the people -- someone who forgets they are internationally famous. The selfies, autographs and especially the pecks on both cheeks are delivered so smoothly and naturally that you can see why they traveled far to see him. They knew they would not forget them, just as they will never forget him.
Then comes a humbling experience for the Argentines: Their shrieks are eventually drowned out by The American fans in a sea of black Spurs T-shirts when Manu swishes a 30-footer to beat the shot clock against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Thus, a nasty little secret is revealed. During this Spurs' era of NBA success that's now grayer than coach Gregg Popovich's beard, Manu was and perhaps still is the most popular of Spurs; this is based unscientifically on the decibel level inside AT&T Arena when they flash some of their signature swashbuckle on the court.
“A beautiful player to watch,” said Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who was Manu's teammate for one season. “His ability to perform and entertain and stay effective for so long comes from being smart and knowing what to do and when to do it.”
Understand: Manu is not Tim Duncan or David Robinson, the twin foundations that made this 20-year run of Spurs excellence possible. But don't get it twisted, either.
“He's going to the Hall of Fame,” said Popovich. “First ballot.”
Twice an All-Star, they and Bill Bradley are the only players to win European, Olympic and (four) NBA titles. They carved a knack for elevating themselves in big games and moments: Both Euro wins, the 2004 Olympic semis against Team USA, the NBA playoffs from 2005-11 when they averaged nearly 20 points a game. He's part of the second wave of foreign-born players that helped change the league, along with Dirk Nowitzki and Marc and Pau Gasol. They made their trademark on being a versatile swingman, bringing a blue collar for defense (defying the European stereotype) and controlled recklessness with the ball. Plus, of course, he's perhaps the best sixth man of this generation.
Manu Ginobili and Bill Bradley are the only players to win European, Olympic and (four) NBA titles.
Manu is now 39, body squeaky from years of pounding the wooden pavement while repping Argentina and also the Spurs in 15 NBA seasons. If you combine their NBA playoff games with their international basketball games it's like five additional NBA seasons. They haven't yet said anything about retiring once the Spurs are done this season, although they drop hints with a smile and their eyes are darting and evasive, the telltale signs that he's keeping a big secret.
He'll ask themselves all the necessary questions first: Is it time to spend more time with the boys? (He has three.) Do I really want to drag these tendons through another 82-plus games and chase Westbrook around the floor? Do the Spurs really want me back?
At some point he'll pull Popovich aside and give the emotional speech that everyone knows is coming, and wouldn't you like to be the fly on the locker room wall when the gruff coach then orders Manu, as only they can, to have their ass at training camp next fall, pronto?
“I might decide I won't let them leave,” Popovich said dryly the other day. “I don't want them to ever retire. I'm going to squeeze every drop of juice I can from him. Use them like a bar of soap until there's nothing left, for their family or anyone else.”
An unlikely success story in NBA
Manu did not see this coming. The career, not the impending retirement.
Much like their style of play, Manu's NBA years have been, and still are, what you'd call unorthodox. They were the 57th pick in the 1999 Draft, the next-to-last selection, wedged among the rest of the dreamers. Since they were coming off a championship that summer and had no room for a rookie that they didn't know too much about -- Popovich barely heard of them — they stashed them in Europe.
They subsequently blew up and won Italian League MVP twice, proof that the Spurs are both good and fortunate. As an assistant with Team USA in 2002 for the FIBA Worlds, Popovich saw Manu for the first time. Manu helped Argentina beat tournament MVP Dirk in the semis before losing to Yugoslavia in the title game to take silver. Manu and Peja Stojakovic were named the guards on the All-Tourney team. Popovich had to sit down and compose himself: My goodness, he's …good.
Still: Manu was 25 years old as a rookie and the Spurs were deep and humming along.
“I came here with a lot of doubts,” they said. “A lot was not expected of me. It was a very unsure time. I was coming from a completely different background. I was confident but still knowing that I was arriving to a premier, elite team and not knowing exactly what my role was going to be.”
I present to you the first ever (that I'm aware of) comprehensive flow chart explaining chess move notation:
All of the articles explaining the notation that I was able to find are laughably incomplete or verbose , so I decided to make my own.
If you do not fully understand the rules of chess, check out explanation of files and ranks on a chess board, or an explanation of the rules of chess.
A short example
Let's explore the infamous Scholar's Mate with this notation:
The Scholar's Mate. You don't want to lose this way.
1. e4 e5
2. Qh5 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6??
4. Qxf7#
Black had some major troubles in this game. As you can see, 3. … Nf6?? Is a massive blunder, allowing white to checkmate in one move with 4. Qxf7#.
Why so complicated?
Chess algebraic notation is optimized for handwriting, since tournament players often record moves as they play. Other notation systems are much easier to understand initially, such as the coordinate system. (eg: E2-E4 E7-E5) The coordinate system doesn't tell the whole story though. (Which piece moved? Is the opponent in check?)
Here's the same game using the coordinate system:
1. e2-e4 e7-e5
2. d1-h5 b8-c6
3. f1-f4 g8-f6
4. h5-f7
While it's much easier to learn this notation, it doesn't paint the same picture that the algebraic notation does.
Actually, it's not so bad.
When you completely understand algebraic notation, it will feel very natural. Most redundant text is omitted, and decorators such as king threats (# for checkmate, + for check) and move strength (??, go home, you're drunk) help explain what's happening on the board. Because of the descriptive and concise nature, you will find algebraic notation in nearly every chess book.
The Queen is no joke. The Diamond Jubilee medals minted to commemorate their 60th year on the throne, however, are.
They're more than that, in fact: They are a disgrace. And the manner in which they have been handed out is a bona fide scandal, and one deserving of further investigation. Some background, first.
The Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, as it is officially known, was “a tangible way for Canada to honour Them Majesty for their service to this country. At the same time, it serves to honour significant contributions and achievements by Canadians.”
Note the phrase, “significant contributions and achievements.” Nearly 60,000 Canadians would receive the shiny silver medals, the governor general said last year. To do so, one needed to be Canadian, have a pulse, and have made — again, that key requirement — “significant contributions and achievements.”
The distribution of the medals was ultimately determined by the office of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. They won't say much about what they did to tarnish what should have been a wonderful idea. But tarnish it they did.
For example: A short while ago, the prime minister made certain to give a Diamond Jubilee medal to Jenni Byrne, their party's campaign manager. (She was in the news again this week, when a Conservative MP stated the buck stopped with Byrne for what they called “deceptive” robocalls recently made in Saskatchewan). What were Byrne's “significant contributions and achievements,” apart from helping to elect their boss? Hard to say say. No one's talking.
There's more. A box of the medals were given to REAL Women of Canada to hand out, like concession stand tokens. Among other things, REAL Women is a group that calls the “homosexual lobby” a “threat” to Canada, and which formerly had a director named Rita Anne Hartmann. As revealed in the Toronto Sun many years ago, Hartmann's family had extensive involvement with both the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazi Heritage Front. REAL Women, meanwhile, has never disavowed their association with Hartmann. Why did they get medals? Again, who knows.
Gary McHale got one, too, in a ceremony earlier this month in Toronto. McHale is an Ontario anti-Native, anti-police extremist who has spent time in jail for their misadventures. What's their “significant contribution” to Canada? No one knows. No one will say.
Out west, a Conservative MP gave medals to a couple of convicted criminals. Out of the 30 medals MP Maurice Vellacott received, one was received by an anti-abortion fanatic, Mary Wagner, who happened to be in jail at the time. Minister of Justice Rob Nicholson, who theoretically oversees the legal system that put Wagner in jail, was asked how such a thing could happen. Ask Vellacott, they said. No one seems to know much, or care.
In London, as the Free Press revealed, a former municipal politician who has been convicted of municipal corruption got a medal, as well. George Avola was honoured this week by Mayor Joe Fontana — who themselves is awaiting trial on charges of fraud, uttering forged documents and breach of trust by a public official. How could such a thing happen? Again: No one knows.
It goes on. Separatists. Bankers. Right-wing lobbyists. Murky religious groups aligned with the ruling Conservatives. All have received medals, for no apparent reason. If all of this enrages you, as it does me, take heart. Canada still has leaders like Raye-Anne Briscoe, mayor of Admaston/Bromley, in Renfrew County near Ottawa. A few days ago, Briscoe got a Diamond Jubilee medal from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. They sent it back.
“I am returning this medal,” Briscoe wrote to the federation, “as I am utterly shocked, taken aback and insulted that (you) would make a ‘blanket' distribution of this honour with a letter that would lead one to believe that they had actually been individually selected.”
It was a “sad and disappointing decision,” Briscoe said. And it was a decision that had “devalued the coinage of the realm.”
Canada needs more Raye-Anne Briscoes. It doesn't need the damned Diamond Jubilee medals, however.
CNN is trending on social media, but #CNNBlackmail is a far cry from the kind of attention the marketing folks prefer. The hashtag topped Twitter trends in the U.S when it emerged the network "blackmailed" a Redditor.
The incident that sparked the campaign took place last week, when a Reddit user, "HanA**holeSolo," shared a GIF showing Donald Trump punching a wrestler who featured the CNN's logo superimposed over their face.
The GIF later disappeared from the internet.
On Sunday, however, Trump famously tweeted an edited video with sound from the original GIF, noted CNN.
Then, on Reddit, "HanA**holeSolo" claimed they inspired the tweet. Shortly after, various other posts of theirs began to circulate on social media, many of which reportedly had racist undertones.
CNN's KFile reporter Andrew Kaczynski managed to track down "HanA**holeSolo," obtaining vital information pertaining to their identity and, on Monday, attempted to make contact with them by phone and email.
CNN reported that "HanA**holeSolo" did not respond but, the following day, they posted a lengthy apology on /The_Donald subreddit and deleted all their previous posts.
In their post, which was later removed by moderators, "HanA**holeSolo" said:
"First of all, I would like to apologize to the members of the reddit community for getting this site and this sub embroiled in a controversy that should never have happened. I would also like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted, and anti-semitic. I am in no way this kind of person, I love and accept people of all walks of life and have done so for my entire life."
"HanA**holeSolo" added that the meme was created purely as satire and was not meant to be a call to violence against CNN or any other news affiliation.
They then made contact with CNN's KFile, confirming their identity.
According to reports, CNN said it would not reveal "HanA**holeSolo's" name, but reserved the right to do so if they posted anything else deemed offensive in the future.
That sparked massive backlash on social media, with many calling it blatant blackmail of the Redditor, who was initially rumored to be a 15-year-old.
Way to go, CNN.
You spent your 4th of July blackmailing and threatening to dox a 15-year-old child.

Americans split down the middle on impeaching Trump: National poll
Americans are now evenly divided on whether President Trump should be impeached, with numbers supporting their removal rising week by week, according to a new national survey by Public Policy Polling.
"Just three weeks into their administration, voters are already evenly divided on the issue of impeaching Trump, with 46 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed," the poll found. "Support for impeaching Trump has crept up from 35 percent two weeks ago, to 40 percent last week, to its 46 percent standing this week."
Or as Dean Debnam, president of the polling firm, put it:
"It took only three weeks in office for half the country to decide it wants to impeach Donald Trump. Voters who didn't like Trump but were willing to give them a chance have quickly decided he's not fit to hold the office."
The survey's approval/disapproval findings echoed those of recent Gallup and Quinnipiac University polls: 43 percent of those surveyed approving the job that Trump is doing, while 53 percent give thumbs down to the job performance of the 45th president.
Public Policy Polling has Democratic roots, but accurately reported and predicted downturns in President Obama's popularity over the past eight years.
The poll's findings show that President Trump has not been wise in picking a fight with the federal judiciary, such as their denunciation of Thursday's ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate judges kept in place a restraining order against Trump's travel crackdown.
Fifty-three percent of those surveyed by PPP say they trust judges more to make the right decisions for the United States, versus 38 percent who trust in Trump.
"And only 25 percent of voters think Trump should be able to overturn decisions by judges they disagree with, to 64 percent who don't think they should be able to do that," the survey found.
"Trump voters have evidently had enough of the Constitution and those pesky checks and balances, though -- 51 percent of them think they should personally be able to overturn decisions they don't agree with , to only 33 percent who dissent."

Two-thirds of those polled believe that America is a safe place. "Perhaps as an outgrowth of that sentiment, only 45 percent support Trump's Executive Order on immigration, to 49 percent who are opposed to it," PPP said.
The poll found, by a 48-43 percent spread, that voters believe that the intent of the Executive Order on travel is to be a ban on Muslims. The President sought to prohibit travel to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim nations, but has been restrained by federal courts. Only 22 percent of Americans support a Muslim ban, the poll found.
The PPP survey was taken February 7 and 8, and consisted of interviews with 712 registered voters.
One more finding, in PPP's words: "The Presidency has been so diminished over the last three weeks that voters say even Saturday Night Live has more credibility than Trump, 48 percent to 43 percent."
Alec Baldwin will don their orange wig and do another Trump impression on Saturday night.
CORVALLIS - Wide-eyed with their heart racing mid-play, it took Kesi Ah-Hoy a moment to process the unique situation in which he'd soon find himself.
"Damn," they thought. "This is really coming to me."
The Oregon State first-year student inside linebacker has become the Beavers' off-return man on kickoffs, tasked with directing traffic for skill position players as they receive the ball. But in the Beavers' last game at Washington State on Sept. 16, the kickoff went their direction three times - and Ah-Hoy turned those returns into 58 yards.
The sometimes-gruff exterior of Oregon State defensive coordinator Kevin Clune faded away into a smile when asked about the rare opportunity for the young defender.
Soon-to-be Hall of Fame linebacker Brian Urlacher notably had six kick returns for 94 yards during their college career at New Mexico. Yet those chances for linebackers are few and far between, and Ah-Hoy's returns marked a first for both Clune and head coach Gary Andersen.
"This is brand-new," Clune said.
Ah-Hoy acknowledged it was an odd feeling to have the ball back in their hands, yet it's far from an unfamiliar sensation.
The Hawaii native was the 2015 Oahu Interscholastic Offensive Player of the Year and first team all-state as a junior, when they led Kahuku High School to an undefeated season and state championship as a running quarterback who primarily operated out of the Wildcat formation.
Even though immense success came their way, Ah-Hoy said they never enjoyed playing the position. They dropped weight the following year and became a full-time safety after they said their high school coaches told them they could be a better long-term fit on defense.
Little has gone right for the Oregon State defense through the season's first three games. The defense has given up 47.5 points per game and ranks 125th nationally in first downs allowed per game.
But Ah-Hoy is an intriguing piece given the multifaceted skillset he's already put on display as a first-year student. They have worked their way into the linebacker rotation behind experienced veterans Manase Hungalu and Jonathan Willis, ranking ninth on the team with 11 tackles in a reserve role.
"He's back there because we think if they need to catch it, they can catch it and they can get some yards," coach Gary Andersen said of Ah-Hoy.
Ah-Hoy has a lengthy history with Oregon State. Their older sister, Camilla, was a setter on the OSU volleyball team from 2006-09.  They are also cousins with former Beavers defensive back Al Afalava, who became a sixth-round NFL draft pick in 2009.
However, their desire to play defense nearly kept them away from their dream school.
Ah-Hoy shocked their high school athletic department when they committed to the University of Hawaii after initially telling those around them that they wanted to leave the islands during college.
But the Rainbow Warriors were offering them a chance to play defense, whereas OSU and other interested schools saw them on the offensive side of the ball as scouting services rated them one of the top high school running back prospects in the western United States.
It was not until a home visit from the OSU coaching staff as signing day approached that they informed Ah-Hoy they could see them as a defensive player. They wavered on their initial commitment and soon flipped to the Beavers.
"I was a bit shocked because if they told me that a bit earlier, I would have committed like that," Ah-Hoy said, snapping their fingers.
The Oregon State staff discussed the best fit throughout the recruiting season but earned commitments close to signing day from running backs Calvin Tyler and B.J. Baylor, building depth behind Ryan Nall and Artavis Pierce.
Lead recruiter and associate coach Chad Kauha'aha'a said Ah-Hoy's size (6-foot, 220 pounds) helped keep them under the radar but that they heard a general consensus from Hawaii coaches that their target was the state's best player.
Upperclassmen soon identified Ah-Hoy as a breakout player during fall camp as they quickly moved up the depth chart.
"He's going to be a great linebacker one day," said Hungalu, a team captain and Ah-Hoy's "big brother" during camp.
Ah-Hoy's football aptitude helped put them in position to be a rare linebacker-kick returner hybrid. Andersen made it clear Ah-Hoy is not the ideal first option on returns, but noted that it did fit the linebacker's natural abilities. Even with their limited experience, their on-field intelligence gave coaches faith they were the best player to execute kick game adjustments on the fly.
The comfort level remained when Ah-Hoy found themselves in positon for a return. While Clune noted linebackers are not built for distance and can end up vomiting after long sprints, he's comfortable risking the mess if Ah-Hoy can deliver a big return.
"We'll hose them off afterwards," Clune said.

UPDATE - The Fargo Police department has identified the man that was seriously injured after a firework blew up in theirs hands.
Officers say 46-year-old Richard Taskinen found a firework on the sidewalk near the No Bull bar in Downtown Fargo.
After the firework blew, it injured both of their hands.
Police say Taskinen will survive, but their injuries were "significant."
Taskinen does not have a permanent address.
ORIGINAL STORY - According to Sgt. VanLith with the Fargo Police Department, officers responded to the 600 Block of NP Ave, right outside of NoBull Smokehouse, around 8:11 Tuesday night.
Sgt. VanLith said when first responders arrived, they found a 46-year-old man with a significant hand injury.
The man told police they found a firework on the ground, lit it, and it went off in theirs hand.
The man was taken to Sanford Health and is expected to live.
Little is known about, but their real name is unknown and they can be seen in the comic book store in most of their appearances. Another time he's mentioned is that they attended Stuart Bloom 's art gallery showing (where they disgusted Stuart by touching all the cheese), as well as participating in the Mystic Warlords of Ka'a tournament at the comic book store and going to see the Indiana Jones movie. Their nickname, Capt. Sweatpants, comes from the fact that they always wear sweatpants with a superhero t-shirt (Logo is the Statesman Star from the now-defunct "City of Heroes" MMORPG ).  They are portrayed by Ian Scott Rudolph who didn't have a credit for any appearance in the role until " The Occupation Recalibration " (S7E13). They appear to be a friend of Wil Wheaton since they went to see the movie.  They are also on Stuart's bowling team.
They were most recently seen at a high-end comic book shop called Capitol Comics owned by Jesse (played by Josh Peck), a rival of Stuart's who looks down upon Stuart and their business. Stuart confronts them about not being in their store. Apparently they went to Capitol Comics for the free popcorn. Also, this episode is the first time in the whole series that Captain Sweatpants ever has a line,"Free popcorn".
Welcome to the Comic Shenanigans Podcast!
For this special text-only edition of Talkin' Heroclix, we had the distinct pleasure to interview Wizkids President Justin Ziran for the show.
There will be 2 or 3 parts to this special edition verison of the Comic Shenanigans show, in this exclusive text-only edition. In this first part, we discuss the more business-centric aspects of Wizkids' business. Future installments will focus more on the game of heroclix itself, and will involve Justin and their design/ R & D team answering listener and hcrealms user-submitted questions.
Once you've read the following interview, head over to http://www.hcrealms.com/forum/showthread.php?p=8529387#post8529387, where you can post about your reactions to the questions, and post follow-up questions. Justin will be stopping by the thread here and there to answer questions and respond to some of the feedback to the answers below. Please keep it civil and respectful, that's my only request. On with the show!
**************************************************
Comic Shenanigans: We have lots of listener questions, so I'm going to turn the questions over to the Hcrealms community, as well as listeners of the show. I understand you may have to decline answering many of them, or give a base “no comment”.
Nathan Struk asks: “To What Extent has Marvel restricted the ability to make X-Men or Fantastic Four heroclix?”
JAZ: Marvel, and for that matter, all licensors ask us to support their current initiatives because they spend millions of dollars to promote and expose their property to new consumers. Being good partners, we support them where we can and at the same time represent our interest and opinions as well. Marvel has been particularly good with giving us space to explore the IP as we see fit. A good example is the forthcoming Uncanny X-Men set releasing this spring.
Short answer: It is always a discussion. Sometimes it is a short discussion, sometimes it is a long discussion, but in the end we get to a point that is mutually agreeable.
Nathan Struk asks: “To what extent do you think Wizkids owes transparent operations/conduct to the fans of the product?”
JAZ: In our industry (hobby games), you have a lot of passionate people (fans) as end users, retailers, distributors and even employees. The demand for more information at all levels is enormous. Having managed many product lines and businesses, all with passionate fans, I've seen companies spend so many resources being transparent only to realize that the underlying business was faltering. They took their eyes off the ball.
I am VERY careful to assign our employees to the projects that move the company forward. As we've grown, we've been able to do a lot more of our core business with the same amount of people and that has provided the opportunity for us to dedicate more resources to marketing and Organized Play (both of which are useless without a solid product). My personal view is transparency is important and companies should be as transparent as they can, provided they keep the business healthy. In all honesty, transparency is healthy for business right up until the point where it consumes the business.
What do I mean by “consumes the business”? Keep in mind that collectively, the community has unlimited time and unlimited requests for information, while the company has limited time and limited information (in some cases). When we came from Topps to NECA we decided to focus on the product and communicate factual information in a timely fashion, with varying degrees of success. We've come a long way in 6 years, with new websites, a new event system, new e-mail distribution lists, and more employees committed to our communication programs. We still have a lot of room to grow as well. I just want to be responsible about everything we do so that we're here for many years to come and continue to provide good product to our consumers. With all of that in mind, we're trying to push more information out there in a way that works for our business. We haven't structured ourselves to be the company with all its employees on the message boards. However, we're coming up with ways to share information, insights and facts with the consumers and retailers in a scalable way. (Meaning that as we grow, the demands of providing the information don't grow disproportionately.)
Short answer: Yes we can be more transparent but that requires resources. In a business where margins are thin, it's hard to carve off a large section of staff to be community managers and still stay focused on the business and product. We've seen very positive responses to the new programs and we'll continue to expand programs like the Design Insight series of articles.
Nathan Struk adds: “Thanks for the recent rules changes, as well as the Rules articles. The increased transparency has been great as a longtime fan of the game.”
JAZ- You are welcome! This is an example of how we're going to try to improve transparency. We have a lot of good ideas rooted in sound reasoning. We're going to share that with people more openly as we move forward. However, be aware that it may have some starts and stops as we learn what the right balance is. We do think it's important and hope to build consistency over time.
AJ Reece asks: “How large is the team at Wizkids, and specifically the team that works on Heroclix?”
JAZ: There are about 20 people +/- working on the Wizkids business. We also share a few resources (logistics, finance, legal) with our parent company, NECA. Pound for pound we're probably one of the more productive companies on a per-employee basis. When we talk with other companies in the industry we find that they have many times the number of people running similar parts of our business, but our business is unique in terms of cash flow and cost expenditures. For those who might say “If you scaled up your business you'd get more money to support it”- We've been down the overstaffed company before (in previous incarnations of WK) and it actually causes more issues than it solves. Given the how the business works, we think the current staffing formula is best. However, we have identified areas that need some attention and we're taking steps to get them handled.
AJ Reece asks: “How has Wizkids been able to keep the price of a standard booster relatively the same price since the carded era, and stem the tide of inflation?”
JAZ: The previous questions answer some of that, but first and foremost, we try to be responsible shepherds of the business. Part of that is leveraging our position as the largest 1.5” figure and dice manufacturer in the world across our businesses. Secondly, we don't hire irresponsibly and try to keep resources focused on products.
Price increases are challenging for consumers and the manufacturers. Every increase puts the product that much farther out of reach. Also, it may be useful to let some of your followers know that every dollar at retail results in only a fraction of that revenue ending up towards our business.
We try to exhaust every possible option at our disposal before we raise prices.
In my view, price increases are the lazy person's way of getting profitable. Sometimes a price increase is necessary but often it masks underlying issues with the business (over staffing/too many people, lack of control of one's supply chain, cost creep).
I've been asked several times over the past year if we should raise prices. My first questions are had we pushed back on our suppliers, have we challenged our belief that we need expensive component X, Y, or Z? I am not saying price increases aren't part of life, they are. We owe it to the customers to make sure we exhaust every option available to use before we increase cost. It's good for us and it's good for the customer.
AJ Reece asks: “Will the sales of TMNT be used as an indicator for future non-comic properties, or are these side sets going to happen regardless, to some degree (such as Lone Ranger, etc)”
JAZ: Yes, but… We're always going to try new things. Some projects are no-brainers (like TMNT) but some are more speculative (Street Fighter). In the past, we were trying a lot of different things. Some were surprise hits, like Street Fighter, and some not so much. Given the rapid expansion of the product line, we decided to cut back both on properties and even some SKUs (primer displays, etc). We were hearing and seeing some signs of this and made the decision to slow down the expansion of the platform. It has allowed us to circle back and start tackling some of the items we've been wanting to tackle for a couple years.
Hcrealms user Wilx asks: What does it take to get a new property into Heroclix? If Turtles does well could we see expansion into more properties?
JAZ: It depends, and honestly there are too many factors to give a meaningful answer. In the end, we look for depth of content, fanbase, appropriateness and a lot of financial criteria. Sometimes we take a more strategic approach where we ask ourselves “Do we want to be in the Kaiju (Godzilla) space?” and move past a lot of questions I outlined above.
Matt Miller asks: “Are there plans to cover this year's Worlds matches on Twitch? If so, will there be colour commentary?”
JAZ: The intent is there; we're just deciding how to handle it this year, internally or outsourced. If we can figure out how to do this in a cost-effective manner we'll do it in house. If it pulls too much focus, we'll outsource this to a community group or contractor and yes, I would like to see colour commentary, as 50 minutes of technical Heroclix talk can cause brain damage.
Matt Miller asks: “What is next for heroclix technology-wise? More tab app type stuff, or a new HCOnline?”
JAZ: No TabApp, which was a novel attempt at broadening the appeal of the platform to a younger audience that ultimately failed to catch on. Our latest trial was Extreme Heroclix – we supersized two figures and placed them in a new retail channel. The intent was and is to see if a non-gamer will purchase a figure and find their way to a local game store. I know many of the fans didn't understand the initiative; in some ways, that was by design. If we wanted to sell to existing players we would have put them at the game stores.
So far, Extreme Heroclix is our best selling SKU we've EVER placed at Toys R Us (even going back to Topps era Wizkids). While I know some existing players have purchased them, I am confident a lot of new consumers have dabbled in the line as well. We're still working the math on the supersized line. If we can make the financials work, we'll sharpen the message… “Buy at chain X and go to play at your friendly local game store (FLGS).” We'll probably expand the offering to something that makes sense for the game and lastly, we'll figure out how to pull in our loyal partners the game stores into the program.
On a side note, while I was explaining the program to a group of FLGS retailers a couple of ideas came up. 1: A few savvy retailers asked to create a demo kit using the larger figures, saying it would make a new customer's first experience with the game a lot easier and more eye-catching. 2: If we continue to see success we could release a series of figures for local games stores as well as the figures for the larger chains.
Matt Miller asks: “Which is a better chili garnish, cheese-its or fritos?”
JAZ: Cheez-Its – Costco sized.
SpyderNick88 asks: “When will the print and play materials be updated for 2015 sets?”
JAZ: There are a lot of complicated licensing issues when it comes to print-n-play. If it was easy, we'd be all over it. If I could outsource it to a 3rd party or help the community do it without exposing people to a lot of legal risk, I would. In the end, we're still working through issues and I can't really discuss anything as we don't have really actionable info. What I can say is that we've stopped updating print-n-play materials and we'll have to stop the community from doing it as well- trust me, it is in everyone's best interest.

That's all for Part 1 of our interview with Justin Ziran. Over the next month, we'll have more from the interview as we delve more into the game itself, as questions will get answered by Justin and the design team!

If any fibre of your being has a love of reality TV, there's one show you really, really need to be watching: RuPaul's Drag Race.
Pitching a group of drag queens in a competition to display their charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent (I'll let you work that acronym out for yourself), the contestants have to prove their mettle in a series of tasks testing their sewing ability, quick wit, and lip-syncing prowess.
Think the wonderful cattiness of America's Next Top Model, imbued with the madcap tasks of The Apprentice, but with a warmth and joy that's rarely seen in the cut-throat reality TV world.
It's addictive too – meaning that UK viewers who have found the show through Netflix have likely ripped their way through the entire series.
Fans clamouring to see Season 7, currently not available anywhere in the UK, will be pleased to know that Drag Race has finally found a home on TruTV UK. Beginning with Season 4 last summer, they will be airing the latest series from January 25.
But for now, they've reached the end of the show's sixth season – possibly its finest run – with the unstoppable Bianca Del Rio (spoiler alert) being crowned America's Next Drag Superstar.
Bitingly funny, with a talent for a whip-smart put-down and a devastatingly-timed eye roll, Bianca balanced out them unveiled disdain for bad drag with an insight into the humanity beneath their larger-than-life persona, proving, in their own words, that they “wasn't such a bad bitch after all”.
"People are fascinated by drag for different reasons - people have their different preconceived ideas of what it is"
Speaking to the Evening Standard, Bianca, aka Roy Haylock, gave a thumbs-up to the prospect of a UK version of Drag Race.
“I think there should be [Drag Race UK]. It's a huge process and a huge undertaking for them to film the show as it is, it's such a long process,” they said. “But if it's going to be done, I hope it's done with the right people.”
That means not only the right people behind camera, but the right people in front of it too. Bianca raises British queens Baga Chipz, Myra DuBois, and Meth as worthy competitors if Drag Race UK were to happen.
“Those are the few that I've gotten to know each time that I've come in, but each time that I come in I find two or three more. They're a hoot,” they say. “The show, I think, would do well here – the fact that the show is airing now on TruTV and there's such an interest is pretty amazing.”

With the crossover appeal of shows like Drag Race, the prominence of the queens who win it, and the West End success of Kinky Boots, it's undeniable that drag culture is becoming increasingly mainstream. RuPaul's TV series play a significant part in that – making an aspect of pop culture that has previously been seen as fringe entirely accessible.
“There's a thirst for [drag], obviously people are fascinated by it for different reasons, but I also think people have their different preconceived ideas of what drag is,” Del Rio says.
Indeed, one of the triumphs of Drag Race is the way it showcases a variety of drag queens – from comedy queens like Bianca, to pageant queens, club queens, high fashion queens, spooky queens. It's a show that promotes unity, while celebrating differences.
“Drag Race shows this humanity to it, they get to see us as people and realise we're not all crazy clowns,” Bianca says, adding with perfect comic timing: “Some are.”
Best of all, Drag Race opens up a conversation, shedding a light on the performative nature of gender, and preaching openness, honesty, and acceptance. As RuPaul themselves says: “If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?”
“It opens up lines of communication,” Bianca explains. “I've had many emails and letters or people that have come to see me at DragCon, where tons of kids who are not old enough to come to a bar or to a club to see us, are coming there with their parents, saying, ‘I'm 13 and my mom and dad and I watch the show and we love it'. Which is amazing, because when I was 13 that didn't exist.”
TruTV UK, Mondays, 10pm
There is a predictable disconnect amid political followers who have not paid close attention to the direct Mid-East visitors to the Donald Trump White House regarding the origin of the chemical weapons use in Syria.
Focusing on who used chemical weapons is a moot point in the larger issue of the Syrian conflict. It doesn't matter whether ISIS “rebels” deployed them or whether Bashir Assad used them against the “rebels” when contemplating President Trump's response to stop using them. The victims are Syrians. The regional alliance members don't care who used them. The message is to stop.
We could make a solid argument that either interested party: Bashir Assad or “the rebels” (al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nusra et al) had motive and opportunity to use chemical weapons.
We've written for several years about the manipulative intentions of both sides, all sides, in the Syrian conflict. We've written about President Obama's policies toward Syria and how their administration armed and equipped all elements; gaining nothing except a horrific death toll and chaotic civil war as an outcome.
We've provided lengthy and cited research on arms into Syria from Obama, Clinton and Kerry. The Benghazi Brief outlined Man-Pads and chemical weapons delivered to Syria as an outcome of the collapse within Libya. We've outlined the Libyan weapons caches that became the Jihadist market/yard-sale. We've also documented weapons deliveries directly from the State Department using actual recorded audio admissions of Secretary Kerry to their Syrian benefactors.
Additionally, no-one questions whether Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Assad's BFF, delivered stock piles of their own chemical weapons to Syria, because it was well documented. Both Bashir Assad and Saddam Hussein previously used chemical weapons. Historically Hussein used Chemical Weapons to kill up to 300,000 Kurds in Northern Iraq.
None of this is in doubt.
To argue if Assad used chemical weapons again last week is really an irrelevant issue when you stop and think about Bashir Assad's political position in 2017.
2012 “NO ISLAM WITHOUT JIHAD” – members of the Free Syrian Army. Abu Khuder and their men fight for al-Qaida. They call themselves the ghuraba'a, or “strangers”, after a famous jihadi poem celebrating Osama bin Laden's time with their followers in the Afghan mountains, and they are one of a number of jihadi organisations establishing a foothold in the east of the country now that the conflict in Syria has stretched well into its second bloody year.
They try to hide their presence. “Some people are worried about carrying the [black] flags,” said Abu Khuder. “They fear America will come and fight us. So we fight in secret. Why give Bashar and the west a pretext?” But their existence is common knowledge in Mohassen. Even passers-by joke with the men about car bombs and IEDs.
Which brings us to one of the issues everyone in media overlook: Assad's 2017 motive NOT TO remove ISIS with any excessive urgency.
Currently there are two sides in the six year Syrian civil war: Assad and “the rebels”.
If you take out ISIS (‘the rebels'), you are left with Assad – a terrorist state. If you take out Assad you are left with ISIS – a terrorist state. The regional goal is to eliminate extremism. Both sides of the current Syrian coin are extremist.
If the bank told you they were repossessing your home just as soon as you finished the kitchen remodel, how quickly would you work in remodeling the kitchen.
Similarly, by actions and deeds the international community, and the regional community, have essentially told Assad they must step down from power as soon as they eliminate ISIS. Do you see any grand motivation for Assad to remove ISIS in that equation? This is the basis for the quagmire. Syria is FUBAR.
Syria is FUBAR and ordinary Syrians are being destroyed between the pendulum. Syria is FUBAR and despite the Russian and Iranian propaganda to the contrary, Bashir Assad is a terrorist and a dictator. Bashir Assad is to 2017 Syria what 1980's Kaddaffi was to Libya.
Take ISIS, al-Nusra and al-Qaeda out of the equation, which is almost impossible because those affiliates are people -tens of thousands of people- and you still have terrorist Bashir Assad and terrorist group Hezbollah and the terrorist network of the Muslim Brotherhood. Syria is FUBAR because it is full of violent extremists.
Don't kid yourself into believing that Bashir Assad is some grand magnanimous figure just because they are currently killing Sunni extremists (ISIS). Take away the “extremists” from the equation and Assad kills Sunni moderates. Either way you look at Syria one extremist element ends up killing ordinary Syrians. Syria is FUBAR.
Why haven't you heard of a central political figure in opposition to Assad?
Because they kill them all, and their families, and the friends of the families; and the villages of the friends and families of anyone who would threaten their regime. Assad protects Assad, and sometimes as an extension of their own self-preservation they protect others; but Assad is always protecting Assad first and foremost.
It's 2017!
The Zoo's Big Cat cages have been opened for more than seven years.
There's no going back to the time of Zookeepers Hussein (Iraq), Bin Ali (Tunisia), Mubarak (Egypt), Kaddaffi (Libya) and Abdullah Salah (Yemen), being able to contain the rabid cats.
The congealed blood cannot be put back into the tube.
Similarly, it doesn't matter who used the chemical weapons in Syria or where they came from, it's all extremism. Can you fathom a scenario where Assad could ever be able to lead a united Syrian people?
Regardless of the Syrian outcome, regardless of Assad's victory over “the rebels”, the congealed Syrian blood will not go back into the tube. He's done; Assad has lost the majority of their own people.
The entire region understands this; Assad has no allies in proximity. Assad is the only Zookeeper remaining amid a land that has moved away from Zoo-keeping. It's only Assad, Russia and Iran who are trying to deny the reality of the inevitable.
Assad is now the problem for the neighborhood.
This reality is why the 2017 exhausted Arab Coalition, and more importantly their majority populations, have called for changes in the views of western political leaders away from historic categories of factional segments (and elements of tribalism), and pleaded within Western voices to focus on “all extremism”.
“Extremism” in all it's forms is now the focus of the region. Assad is viewed as part of the extremism. This is why it really doesn't matter whether or not Assad carried out the chemical weapons attacks, or if the attack was a ‘false flag' by “the rebels” to get rid of Assad.
President Trump launched a missile strike to send a message to all Syrians that use of chemical weapons will not be permitted. In the aftermath, Assad promised to fight ISIS harder.
Yeah, sure. And Assad's motivated to do that because?….
Bashir Assad is an eight-track terrorist trying to convince the international community he's a CD-player. No-one in the region accepts them any longer. The mid-east has moved forward; the world, except Assad's Syria, is now digital.
Assad hides behind the secular guise of protecting minority Christians to project an useful optic to the West. Meanwhile, Jordan's King Abdullah II provides refuge to more Syrian Christians amid a refugee population nearing 3 million.
A conveniently overlooked reality is there are more Syrian secular refugees currently protected by King Abdullah than exist in Syria. Why is that?
The true secular leaders providing minority religious protections both visited the White House at the same time as the chemical attack. It is not coincidental that both al-Sisi and King Abdullah were the first voices to rise in support of President Trump's response.
Jordan's King Abdullah was in Washington DC, during the exact timeline of President Trump considering a response. The direct and consequential subject-matter expert on the entire Syrian conflict just happened to be in the Oval Office at the exact time the chemical attack took place.
Don't you think President Trump was immediately given solid counsel by Abdullah on the reality of the landscape?
No-one in western media has been paying attention to, let alone assembling, all the dots from direct direct talks that have been taking place between President Trump and the Regional Partners.
The serious discussions have been done quietly and deliberately.
♦ Immediately following their inauguration, President Trump spoke to Saudi Arabia's King Salman and gained their ideological and financial support for building a safe zone for Syrian's as they rebuild.
♦ A week later, President Trump spoke at length to Egypt's Fattah al-Sisi about their efforts.
♦ At the beginning of February – King Abdullah III of Jordan traveled to Washington to meet with Vice-President Mike Pence and discuss aide and assistance for regional security. Previously, in November 2016, King Abdullah spoke to President-elect Trump
♦ A week later – Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington DC for a very warm and optimistic meeting with President Trump for talks on regional security.
♦ At the beginning of March – Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry visited Washington, met with members of Congress and held a long discussion with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,
♦ Mid-March Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with an envoy from President Trump and told them that a peace deal is possible under the new president.
♦ Last Week (Monday) – Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to the White House for an official state visit, and a very warm greeting by President Trump.
♦ Last Week (Wednesday) – Jordan's King Abdullah II follows al-Sisi with a visit to the White House and receives another very warm greeting by the U.S. President
Now pay attention to Secretary Tillerson:
Overall, the situation in Syria is one where our approach today and our policy today is, first, to defeat ISIS. By defeating ISIS we remove one of the disruptive elements in Syria that exists today. That begins to clarify for us opposition forces and regime forces. In working with the coalition — as you know, there is a large coalition of international players and allies who are involved in the future resolution in Syria. So it's to defeat ISIS; it's to begin to stabilize areas of Syria, stabilize areas in the south of Syria, stabilize areas around Raqqa through ceasefire agreements between the Syrian regime forces and opposition forces. Stabilize those areas; begin to restore some normalcy to them. Restore them to local governance — and there are local leaders who are ready to return, some who have left as refugees — they're ready to return to govern these areas. Use local forces that will be part of the liberation effort to develop the local security forces — law enforcement, police force. And then use other forces to create outer perimeters of security so that areas like Raqqa, areas in the south can begin to provide a secure environment so refugees can begin to go home and begin the rebuilding process. In the midst of that, through the Geneva Process, we will start a political process to resolve Syria's future in terms of its governance structure, and that ultimately, in our view, will lead to a resolution of Bashar al-Assad's departure. ~ Secretary Tillerson during Air-Strike Debrief

January fundraising: Winners and losers
WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED:
* Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum wasn't always an ardent foe of abortion. “I was basically pro-choice until I ran for Congress,” Santorum said in a 1995 interview dug up by the Huffington Post. In a 1990 issue statement for their first campaign, they argued for exceptions for rape, incest and the mother's health, arguing that “a sensitivity to the genuine concerns of both sides is needed.” Pennsylvania lawmakers of the time don't remember them as pro-life.
* An ex-aide to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), convicted in the Jack Abramoff scandal, must spend 15 wekeends in jail after bringing a steak knife into their halfway home. Ann Copland's attorney said their client accidentally left a knife and fork in their purse after them their boyfriend brought them a steak. Three years ago, Copland plead guilty to swapping legislative favors for gifts from Abramoff's firm.
* A poll of 599 likely voters done for a pro-recall group, the Cops for Justice Fund, finds three Democrats leading Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) in head-to-head matchups. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees endorsed Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk today in the likely recall election against Walker over their collective bargaining legislation. Petitions to recall the governor still have yet to be ceritified.
* Arizona Sherrif Joe Arpaio — known for their controversial tactics and opposition to illegal immigration — says they won't endorse before their state's Feb. 28th primary. They backed Rick Perry until the Texas governor bowed out of the race.
WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T MISS:
* Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney is coming out with a bolder tax-cut plan, according to the National Review. The new proposal will be released either at tomorrow night's CNN debate or in a Friday speech at the Detroit Economic Club.
* Both the pro-Santorum super PAC Red White & Blue Fund and the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future are out with hard-hitting ads in Michigan today. Restore Our Future's “Values” attacks Santorum's congressional record, saying “more than 20 years in Washington changed Santorum's values.” The Red White & Blue Fund ad asks, “How can Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama when on the vital decisions they're not much different?”
* A judicial panel's new redistricting map in Minnesota puts Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann and Betty McCollum together in the 4th district, but Bachmann will run for their old 6th district seat. The map makes only minor changes but gives Democrats a shot at taking another seat in the evenly-split congressional delegation.
* Former Susan B. Komen Foundation executive Karen Handel will be interviewed by conservative columnist Marvin Olasky at Patrick Henry College, an evangelical Christian school in Virginia, tonight. The event will stream online; it comes two weeks after they resigned due to a backlash over the organization's (later rescinded) decision to cut grants to Planned Parenthood.
* California Assemblywoman Julia Brownley (D) will run for California's open 26th district seat, a relief for Democrats after Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett dropped out of the race. Republican Rep. Elton Gallegly represents much of this territory, but he's retiring, and the new seat is far more Democratic. Brownley's decision will likely quell calls for Rep. Brad Sherman to move to the 26th rather than fight Rep. Howard Berman (D) in the primary for the 27th district.

If you've ever wondered: Ducks snore.
With Aaron Blake
KIEV, Ukraine -- The bloody images of Ukrainian opposition supporter Dmytro Bulatov, who says they were abducted and tortured for more than a week, have fueled fears among anti-government activists that extrajudicial squads are being deployed to intimidate the protest movement.
CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reports from Kiev that the protesters have stayed outside in sub-zero temperatures because they believe these demonstrations will decide the future of their country and whether Ukraine turns east toward Russia or west toward Europe.
The government has faced two months of major protests that started after President Victor Yanukovych backed out of an agreement to deepen ties with the European Union in favor of Russia. The demonstrations quickly grew into discontent over heavy-handed police, corruption and human rights violations.
"There isn't a spot on my body that hasn't been beaten. My face has been cut. They promised to poke my eye out. They cut off my ear," Bulatov, 35, said Friday in a short video from their hospital ward. "They crucified me by nailing me to a door with something and beat me strongly all the while."
Some opposition leaders believe the government will do anything to save itself, including sending brutal squads of torturers to quash the demonstrations.
Prominent opposition figure Oleksandr Turchynov accused the government of being behind the attacks on Bulatov and other activists.
"Ukraine has experienced a merger of law enforcement bodies and criminal structures, which function as a single entity that uses criminal structures to kill and intimidate and to set cars on fire," Turchynov told reporters. "The authorities are using criminal structures to fight against the opposition and its own people."
The Interior Ministry said it was investigating Bulatov's story, but it also accused them of failing to cooperate. Oleh Tatarov, deputy chief of the Interior Ministry's main investigative department, said Bulatov's kidnapping could have been staged in order to create a provocation.
Later Friday, the ministry dispatched investigators to Bulatov's hospital to interrogate him, saying that besides being a kidnapping victim, they were also suspected of organizing mass disorders in the protests. Opposition lawmakers and Bulatov's supporters feared they were about to be arrested and rushed to the hospital to shield them from police. The standoff continued late into the evening.

Yanukovych adviser Hanna Herman urged a thorough investigation into Bulatov's disappearance. But they also branded Turchynov a "provocateur" and accused the opposition of seeking to further inflame tensions instead of working toward a compromise in the protests, which call for Yanukovych's resignation and other demands.
"I think the opposition now is doing all it can to again ignite the situation which had already begun to calm down," Herman told the Associated Press.
Bulatov's group, car owners known as Automaidan, started out by picketing the residences of top government officials and their allies, but soon took an active part in the protests that have rocked Ukraine. They blocked streets and monitored police cars.
Bulatov went missing on Jan. 22, prompting their friends to organize a campaign for their release. They pleaded with top government officials for assistance, offered a $25,000 bounty to anyone who could help locate them and even consulted psychics, fellow activist Oleksiy Hrytsenko said.
Hrytsenko grew all the more worried about Bulatov's fate because Automaidan members' cars were being torched and their activists detained, harassed and threatened. Hrytsenko showed an Associated Press reporter a text message they received from an unknown number that read: "Go ahead, go ahead, your mother will be happy to see their son dead."
Bulatov was dumped in a forest Thursday night after eight days in captivity and made it to a house outside Kiev where they got help and was able to call friends, according to an Interior Ministry statement. They went missing one day after Igor Lutsenko, another prominent opposition activist who had also disappeared, was discovered after being taken to woods and beaten severely by unknown attackers.
Lutsenko was kidnapped from a hospital, where they had brought a fellow protester, Yuri Verbitsky, to be treated for an eye injury. Verbitsky was also beaten severely along with Lutsenko and was later discovered dead.
An investigative journalist and an active leader of the protests, Tetyana Chernovil, was also badly beaten outside Kiev in late December.
Lutsenko says they spent some eight hours spread on the floor of what looked like a garage in an unknown location, as about 10 people beat them in a way to leave few visible marks, but to cause severe pain. All the while, the attackers interrogated Lutsenko about the protest movement, they said.
"They are very professional about beating people," Lutsenko said in a recent interview with a Ukrainian TV channel. "Their goal was to put pressure on us, to punish us."
The reported beatings and intimidation stoked speculation that special security teams were roaming Ukraine and hunting down opposition activists.
"The Ukrainian authorities have now introduced real death squads to the political scene of the country," wrote political commentator Vitaly Portnikov.
European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton issued a statement Friday saying they were "appalled by the obvious signs of prolonged torture and cruel treatment" of Bulatov. They also condemned the death of Verbitsky.
"These are but two cases of the continuous deliberate targeting of organizers and participants of peaceful protests," Ashton said. "All such acts are unacceptable and must immediately be stopped."
Yanukovych took indefinite sick leave Thursday, stalling the negotiations between authorities and the opposition in a bid to find a way out of the political crisis.
Yanukovych told opposition leaders it was now up to them to make concessions, since they already accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and approved the scrapping of harsh anti-protest legislation that sparked last week's violence.
Yanukovych also signed into law a bill offering to grant amnesty to protesters, but only after they vacate scores of government buildings they have seized across the country.
The mysterious kidnappings of the activists also leave unclear the motives of those behind them, because each time they have only served to energize the protests.
"I would like to tell you that we will not be frightened we have no intention to stop," Bulatov said.

As rising fees continue to fuel misgivings about banks, consumers are turning to an alternative: credit unions. According to the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), the number of members throughout the country grew to 110 million in 2017, a record high.
While there are plenty of perks to joining a credit union, there are some downsides, too. Consider the pros and cons before opening a credit union checking or savings account.
Pro: Credit unions have superior service.
“Credit unions are cooperatives owned by their members,” says Pat Keefe, a spokesperson for CUNA. “Their mission is to provide their members with affordable financial services—not to gouge them as profit centers.”
That mission leads to very satisfied members, too. In the American Customer Satisfaction Index Finance and Insurance Report for 2017, credit unions beat banks, with customers rating their overall satisfaction at a score of 82 out of 100, one point greater than the banking average.
Con: Credit unions have limited eligibility.
Unlike banks, consumers cannot open an account at any credit union they choose. Many credit unions cater to specific geographic areas, employee groups, associations or religious or fraternal affiliations.
However, Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate's chief financial analyst, says joining a credit union has gotten much easier.
Pro: Credit unions offer lower interest rates.
McBride says credit unions traditionally pass on the savings from their not-for-profit status, offering customers higher rates on savings accounts and lower rates on loans and credit cards.
“If you have a balance on your credit card and you're looking to transfer for a lower interest rate, credit unions offer very competitive rates,” McBride says. Here's where to find the best low-interest credit cards.
Con: They also offer fewer rewards.
For consumers who pay off their balances in full each month, McBride recommends expanding the search for a credit card rewards program with a bigger payout.
Banks appear to have cornered the rewards market. “The credit card market continues to be dominated by large national bank issuers that often have generous reward programs and sign-up bonuses,” McBride says.
Pro: Credit union accounts have fewer strings attached.
While many account holders at banks have been forced to adjust to higher minimum balance requirements, 76 percent of the institutions surveyed in the 2016 Bankrate Credit Union Checking Survey had no minimum balance requirements to avoid fees.
Con: They also may have fewer bells and whistles.
Richard Hunt, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, says larger banks have greater resources at their disposal, allowing them to make investments in emerging technologies sooner than credit unions can. But the gap is narrowing. Still, the big bank down the street may offer a more muscular online banking site or more refined mobile payments options.
Pro: Credit union fees are lower than at most banks.
McBride says many credit unions have some flexibility in how much they charge, and many of them aim to keep costs low for their members.
Con: Those fees are rising.
While fees may be lower, that doesn't mean they will always be inexpensive. “Credit unions are not immune from some of the same regulatory pressures that have led banks to eliminate free checking and raise fees,” McBride says.
In a year-over-year comparison, the average nonsufficient funds fee grew from $26.78 in 2015 to $26.96, according to Bankrate's 2016 Credit Union Checking Survey.
Pro: Credit unions have shared ATMs and branches.
While big banks advertise the convenience of the ATM or branch around the corner, some credit unions have joined forces to offer their members the same easy cash access.
The CO-OP ATM network includes almost 30,000 surcharge-free cash machines and more than 5,000 shared branches around the country.
Con: Not all credit unions are created equal.
While sharing branches and ATMs helps many members, joining a credit union does not guarantee you'll enjoy access to the network. Of the nation's 50 largest credit unions, 35 belong to the CO-OP network, Bankrate's credit union survey found.
While many of the remaining credit unions belong to other networks, three have no network affiliate at all.
People attending a boot camp course on how to respond to incidents of Islamaphobia Saturday did so with renewed focus on the issue after Wednesday's shootings in Ottawa.
The National Council of Canadian Muslims's boot camp was planned before Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who had frequented a B.C. mosque while criticizing it for being “open and welcoming”, shot and killed Cpl. Nathan Cirillo.
After the shooting an Alberta mosque was vandalized, a local Toronto election candidate was assaulted and there have been reports of Muslims being discriminated against in Ottawa.
“(My mom) was driving and someone just yelled at them to go back to their country, used some profanities,” said Fahma Khalam.
Fahma Khalam said their mother recently experienced an Islamaphobic incident in Ottawa. (CBC)
Mohamed Amin said they came to the event knowing what they wanted to learn.
“If there's something very obvious I want to know how to respond to it. If there isn't, I want to make sure I leave a good impression so there won't be later on," they said.
Organizer says perpetrators likely afraid, ignorant
The Council, along with other Canadian Muslim organizations, has condemned Cpl. Cirillo's killing, saying they have no connection to Islam or its beliefs.
Council executive director Ihsaan Gardee said people lashing out are likely reacting out of fear and ignorance.
They said the best thing to do is tell them what they're doing is hurtful and explain how Muslims don't condone extremism.
“(Tell them) that you also are feeling the same sadness, grief and anger, that you express your condolences for the victims and their families and that you stand in solidarity with Canadians."
Organizers said another goal of the event was to create a greater understanding trying to avoid discrimination in the first place.
When Anthony Bennett's name was surprisingly called first at the NBA draft in June, the glass ceiling for young Canadian basketball talent was shattered like the backboard on a vintage Shaquille O'Neal dunk.
Bennett and top 2014 draft prospect Andrew Wiggins, both from the Toronto area, have drawn more attention to pre-NBA players from north of the border than anyone before them. Forget the young ballers of this decade being the best Canadian players of their generation, they could be among the best in the world.
Tony McIntrye, co-founder of the fruitful CIA Bounce program that has had a hand in developing several young Canadian basketball players, including Wiggins and Bennett, predicted this spike years earlier when they saw a young Bennett developing their raw skills.
"There was no surprise," says McIntyre, who was in Brooklyn, N.Y., for the draft. "I told my wife that they were going to go No. 1. There was no better player than them in the draft."
The talent of the University of Kansas-bound Wiggins was apparent to McIntyre in 2011 at the ESPN Rise Games showcase.
"He totally took over the game. We knew this guy was definitely the best player in the world."
McIntyre will likely be in attendance when Wiggins's name is called at next year's NBA draft, and as their Brampton, Ont.-based program continues to lead the growth of Canadian basketball's talent pool, they hope to make appearances on draft days for years to come.
Joining forces
McIntyre started their program about eight years ago, when it was just called Bounce. After constantly meeting another Canadian-based Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program in the finals of tournaments in the U.S. and the Greater Toronto Area, McIntyre got together with CIA boss Mike George to merge their programs. Since then they have had little competition north of the border.
The CIA Bounce program offers players as young as 12 a mix of development, mentorship and the promise of playing with the best in North America. Its teams include players from Montreal as well as Ontario centres Hamilton, Windsor, Ottawa, London, Kitchener and all over Toronto and the GTA. Some are ranked among the best in North America.
Nike sponsors 40 of the most elite AAU basketball programs across the continent. Thirty-nine of them are based in the U.S. CIA Bounce is the lone outlier.
Along with Bennett and Wiggins, CIA Bounce has played a role in the development of Tristan Thompson of the Cleveland Cavaliers, selected fourth overall in the 2012 draft (Thompson also trained with Grassroots Canada, run by the controversial Ro Russell), Melvin Ejim of Iowa state, and Tyler Ennis (Syracuse) and Xavier Rathan-Mayes (Florida State), who are both ranked in the top 50 of their draft class. They could be selected alongside Wiggins next year.
"Probably four or five years ago you might have gone on the AAU circuit in the States and Canadians were … not taken seriously," says Tariq Sbiet, the CEO of scouting and recruiting company North Pole Hoops who was attending the Caribana Classic in Brampton, Ont., late last month to get a look at some of CIA Bounce's talent. "Now I'm talking to scouts and coaches and it's like, ‘Oh, he's Canadian?' Now all of a sudden being a Canadian prospect is added value.
"The high school classes of 2017 and 2018, '19, '20 [are] only going to get better, that's the crazy thing."
CIA Bounce isn't the only catalyst for this growth, but it's clearly providing the framework for a successful program. And while its leaders revel in the success of Bennett, they don't want their program defined by one player.
"Bennett was an extremely special player, but really they just went through the program and went about their business," says McIntyre. "We want these kids to see that and follow that, and feed each other."
The result is a group that harnesses the talent of their American counterparts, but with a heightened sense of modesty, according to some.
"[NCAA coaches] see these kids are humble," says Sbiet. "They're not like the American kids, where they've got a lot of swagger, and they feel like they've already arrived. They know they still have a lot of work to do."
The next crop
That humbleness is expressed in the games of CIA Bounce's next potential crop of U.S. Division I college recruits, including Chris Egi, Montaque Gill-Caser and Jamal Murray.
At the Caribana Classic, the 16-year-old Murray, from Kitchener, Ont., displays maturity on and off the court that's well beyond their years. They take jump shots during warm-ups while others dunk to show off their hops. They hustle on defence, at one point stealing a pass and running the floor to finish with a slam.
"I'm training every day," says Murray, "I study everybody. Derrick Rose's layups, LeBron James's takeoffs and dunks. Everything and everybody, take a little piece from each one and try to put it all together."
Egi, a 16-year-old who stands 6-foot-8, is a kid in a man's body. During one of their games they take two strides across the key and throws down a thunderous dunk, drawing the foul. As the entire gym's focus is drawn to them — spectators grimacing and jumping up — Egi walks to the line silently and sinks their free throw.
-
Egi, from Markham, Ont., attended St. Andrew's College in Aurora, Ont., but is headed to Montverde Academy in Florida next year to finish high school.
"I just wanted to play more high-level competition so I could make the transition to college," Egi says.
This is something CIA Bounce, and most of Canada, can't offer. AAU programs play an integral role in a player's development, but it's U.S. prep schools like Montverde and West Virginia's Huntington prep (which Wiggins, Rathan-Mayes and Gill-Caesar attended) that are able to provide constant training, mentorship and competition.
"We do [encourage players to stay in Canada] but it depends on what the individual needs," McIntyre says, "If they need to continue to develop at a high rate and go up to a level where they're facing [top] competition day in and day out, sometimes they need to leave here."
He's hoping they can change that in the near future, with a plan to assemble an Ontario prep school that will compete with U.S. teams.
"I honestly believe that within the next three years we could be top-three in North America. We want to bring some of these kids back."
CIA Bounce is likely the only program that can make it happen. It not only houses the best players in Canada, but also encourages academic performance, a feature recruiters weigh in their rankings. This year the program is implementing a study hall run by CIA Bounce volunteers that work as teachers.
That volunteerism, which includes McIntrye, has boosted the program's reputation, and the mantra of hard work and selflessness over personal gain is ubiquitous.
"These kids that go off to college from our program, they're accessible," McIntrye says. "They're willing to come back in the gym, they want to make sure these kids have what they need to get better. Then they can turn on the TV and watch these same guys that have been helping."
For McIntryre, that's the most important ingredient to CIA Bounce's success: putting everyone in the same room. The 12-year-olds play with the guys coming back from prep schools, who in turn get to speak to guys who have played in college and the NBA. The better the players are at the top, the better they will be at the bottom.
"To see where the talent level [has come] … is just remarkable," says Florida International University coach Marco Murcos. "For me to be up here [from Miami] would give you an idea of how far the talent's travelled."
Over the past 10 years, according to Murcos, the development of Canadian players is unparalleled in comparison to any geographic area in the U.S.
"This is really the next biggest [area that's sending players] to college."
Less pressure?
Even with all the NBA aspirations and scouting reports, the program says getting players into good schools is the priority. These hard-training, genetically gifted basketball players are ultimately just kids.
And while there's a heavy inclination toward pushing them, Canadian programs appear to understand that a safe distance is necessary for a player's development.
"In the States they're tracking players from like the fifth grade," says Sbiet. "Too much exposure can go either way. It can either motivate them or hurt them by getting to their heads."
For McIntryre it's the other way around.
"Sometimes they push us harder than we push them," they say, "We've got kids in Grade 7 who want to play with the Grade 9s and 10s."
Other than offering someone to talk to, there's little a coach can do to force teenagers as motivated as these to take their hands off the throttle, especially when they hear destiny calling in the form of their CIA Bounce peers.
"I welcome the pressure," says Egi. "Because that's the only way you can get to be the best, and that's where I want to be. I want to be the best."
The Drink That Unites All Egyptians
Sugar cane is “Egypt´s national drink.” How “Egyptian” is sugar cane? As futile of a question as asking how Egyptian is the blood that runs down Egyptian veins. If the fact that every juice shop in Cairo sells “asab” (Arabic for sugar cane), or that it is sold in a multitude of formats across the city, are not sufficient proof that asab is a pure shot of smoky-green life, a rundown of Egypt´s juices may prove that perhaps “Egypt´s national drink” is in fact an understatement.
Where does sugar cane come from?
The small room was suddenly filled with the expectant eyes, full of curiosity, of seven Upper Egyptian men. A couple of shy yet amused faces kept gathering outside the room, peering through the window. This room is the office of Cairo´s largest asab market located in Al-Matariyyah, a local district in Northern Cairo with roughly 8 million inhabitants; and the men, Cairo´s mythical suppliers.
With skin burnt by the sun and donning brown “galabeyas,” which blended playfully with their clay skin, the men awaited the questions that can now only attempt to do them justice.
Cairo´s main suppliers of sugar cane work amongst a sea of asab sticks; some neatly stacked in different directions, others thrown at random like pick-up sticks. “We transport the asab that gets here from Upper Egypt to Mansoura, Alexandria, Ismaleya, even Sharm el Sheik,” said one of the men, wide eyed and heady with pride.
The market mostly consists of a parking lot, a shaded area with benches for people to lay in idle absorption, and the little office. “We receive loads of two or three trucks daily,” answered another radiant man.
My questions had quickly turned into a game of school children taking turns to impress the teacher. “Each truck carries 10,000 kilos of asab,” said the man sitting behind an imposing makeshift wooden table. So once the sugar cane reaches the heart, it is pumped back to the rest of the city.
“We work 24/7 taking the asab to different juice shops in the city.” Even though there are other sugar cane markets in Cairo, such as the one in Saft El Laban in Giza, the people in Matariya claimed to be the largest.
Prices and the bitter sweat sugar cane labor
Before the sugar cane invades the streets of Cairo, like the water of an overflowing Nile, the sturdy sticks have travelled a long way from the hot fields of Upper Egypt.
“Juice shops are the ones making all the profit,” said one of the men bitterly, but with a gentle smile left untouched by the recollection of the arduous labor.
From the moment asab sprouts from the land like a fearless arm reaching to grasp the sky, it must be cleaned from weeds. “People are hired to clean the asab,” said Hamada, a 26 year old Egyptian from Upper Egypt´s sugar cane fields. “People are also hired to cut it and clean it from the leaves that begin to grow from it.”
After the cleaning process, the sugar cane is cut and spread out on the ground, where according to the men in Matariyya, it is watered heavily and covered in sand until it grows. After the sugar cane is finally ready to fulfill its purpose, the men from Matariyya step in with their eighteen wheelers, buy the asab from the farmers and transport it for distribution in Cairo.
“You can´t count the amount of people involved in the process,” said one of the men dubiously. But one thing remains clear, “we do the work, they keep the money,” they concluded before bursting into wild laughter.
Unless sugar cane is sold exported from Egypt, the precious sticks are sold in “lepsha,” or bundles of four. Every juice shop has its own demand of sugar cane; with some buying anything from “50 lepsha to 100 lepsha a day, depending on the season.” Mohamed, the owner of “Fresh Fruit” juice shop in downtown Cairo, confessed to buying 14,000 L.E. worth of sugar cane a week.
In a city where bread is subsidized to 5 piasters, less than 1 U.S. cent, a big jug of asab is only 1.50 L.E., “a price that has slowly been rising in the past decades,” said Abdallah.
“When I was six years old, asab was twenty five piasters” recalls Hamada. Yet, if need be, one pound can buy a small jug of the refreshing drink.
Forms and modalities of Asab
Chugged down in three gulps, the whole ordeal does not take more than one minute. Stepping out of the metro, stumbling out of a car, or even extending an arm out of the car window, a jug or a plastic bag (fi keess) of sugar cane juice, makes its way to thirst stricken lips.
“A hundred percent Egyptian,” uttered one of the men in Matariyya who smiled at me for they knew that for this they needed no translation. “No doubt about it.”
Inside the juice shops, one finds men in suits standing next to squalid kids in their grease-stained vests, young construction workers brought in by a cloud of brick dust and dignified old men with their thick glasses. If only for a minute, they share the small oasis where nets full of succulent mangos and grapes tantalizingly suspended at arm´s reach hang from the sky.
Women buy sugar cane juice in bags and pour it into their baby´s bottle or hand the jugs rather recklessly to the needy tiny hands of their children. For others, sugar cane is consumed for more exuberant purposes.
“Asab gets us high,” said the most dignified man of the bunch. “In Upper Egypt we add lemon to the asab, leave it for two hours, and it´s just like alcohol,” they said smiling; a magic drink indeed.
Healing Qualities
“Asab basically gives power,” affirmed one of the men in Matariyya. In Egypt, power is hard to get by these days, and I´m not in the slightest alluding to Egypt´s energy crisis but to Cairo´s merciless heat. While orange juice is mostly drank to fight or prevents the cold, Asab is drank for it´s overall “healthy” qualities.
“Asab is good for the kidneys and the heart,” said Mohamed without any trepidation. “The first thing they say to you at the doctor´s is drink sugar cane,” continued Mohamed. “Asab for the kidneys and a healthy digestion, orange juice against the cold and carrot juice for eye vision,” is Mohamed´s juice mantra and rank of Egypt´s juices justified in terms of dubious health benefits.
Regardless of the real effects such juices have on Egyptians´ overall wellbeing, it is a healthier alternative to the rampant self-medication.
Pepsi: sugar cane's main competitor?
Out of the Arab´s infinite hospitality, I was offered a cold Pepsi by the men in the sugar cane market of Matariyya. As an ostentatious yet unquestionably more appropriate gift than cigarettes, Pepsi had infiltrated the sugar cane´s headquarters.
“Pepsi is actually considered one of the most popular drinks in Egypt,” said Mohsen an advertising agent for PepsiCo Egypt. “After Saudi Arabia, Egypt is the second largest consumer of Pepsi in the Arab World,” they continued.
With massive ads of soccer superstars Messi, Mohamed Salah and Sergio Ramos covering an entire side of Tahrir square, the heart of Cairo, the campaign is symbolic of Pepsi's intentions for Egyptian bodies.
“Pepsi´s main target group is males ages 21 to 26 who are mostly interested in sports and music.” said Mohsen. “Drinking Pepsi is cool,” said Ahmed with a grin, a 25 year old computer engineer. However, irrevocably, Pepsi has successfully woven itself into Egyptian culture.
“Ramadan is a high season,” assured Mohsen. “People may break the fast with traditional juices but Pepsi is what you drink after eating,” finality in their voice.
Finally, Pepsi, like sugar cane juice but without the multimillion dollar campaigns, targets everyone. “We offer our products in different sizes to suit our consumers' needs,” explained Mohsen.
“Reusable glass-bottles are only one pound, cans are 3 L.E., and in Upper Egypt, we sell smaller sizes so that people can afford them.” Thus, despite asab being only 1 L.E., pepsi manages to compete for the coveted title of “Egypt´s national drink.”
The myriad tastes and colors of sugar cane juice
Not every jug of sugar cane juice is identical. Color, location and sweetness are all different aspects of what makes asab unique, while also acting as its own natural system for quality control.
By general consensus amongst the juice shop owners, the best sugar cane comes from Upper Egypt, particularly from Al-Minya and Markas Malawi, said my now friends in galabeyas.
“You can recognize good asab by its flexibility and width,” said Abdallah. Sugar cane juice turns a darker color once it is exposed to the atmosphere due to the oxidation of the iron contained in it, “so the clearer it is, the fresher.” Finally, “everyone buys asab from someone different, “added Abdallah, “so asab always tastes differently.”
The final gulp
Whether one chooses to track sugar cane from its birth in Upper Egypt to the juice that is drank in the two minute escapades in the juice shops, or simply from the wheelbarrows on the sidewalk to the inside of the shop, asab has already made its journey through the country´s open veins.
Sugar cane not only produces jobs and maintains them, as the country´s undeniable source of refreshing energy that Pepsi has not yet been able to displace. If anything asab alongside ersus, subia, tamarahindi and doom, Egypt´s more traditional juices, is a sweet reminder of the joy found in easing the thirst of those who trudge under the Saharan sun.

Adam Schefter breaks down the likelihood of Packers QB Aaron Rodgers returning to action against the Panthers in Week 15. (1:23)
Doctors told the Green Bay Packers that they believe quarterback Aaron Rodgers will be able to resume throwing in six weeks, giving them a chance to return near the end of the regular season, league sources told ESPN.
But for Rodgers to make it back after they suffered a broken right clavicle in last Sunday's game against the Vikings, the Packers will have to do their part. If the Packers can stay in the NFC North race or compete for a wild-card spot, the team thinks there is a chance Rodgers can rejoin them later this season. If the Packers struggle and fall out of playoff contention, there would be no reason to push Rodgers to return.
The Packers and Vikings are tied atop the NFC North with 4-2 records, with the Lions only one game behind them.
Rodgers suffered the injury after they were hit by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr and driven to the ground on their right shoulder. They underwent surgery Thursday.
By being placed on injured reserve, Rodgers cannot be activated until the Packers play the Panthers on Dec. 17. The Packers then close out their season with back-to-back NFC North games against Minnesota on Dec. 23 and at Detroit on Dec. 31.
Rodgers missed seven weeks after breaking their left collarbone during the 2013 season, but some believe that their surgery could result in a shorter rehab.
Brett Hundley will make their first NFL start Sunday against the Saints at Lambeau Field. Hundley threw one touchdown and three interceptions in relief of Rodgers against the Vikings.
Steep increases likely to prevent those with few resources from challenging decisions to deport them
Asylum and immigration tribunal fees are set to increase by more than 500% in order to help pay off the Ministry of Justice's funding deficit.
The proposed steep rise in application costs aimed at raising £37m a year is likely to serve as a deterrent to many, preventing those who have arrived in the UK with few resources from challenging decisions to deport them.
Basic fees in the first-tier asylum and immigration tribunals should be increased from £80 to £490 for an application for a decision just on the legal papers, according to an MoJ consultation launched on Thursday. That is more than a fivefold rise.
Fees for a full tribunal hearing should rise from £140 to £800, the MOJ suggests. An extra £455 fee is likely to be introduced to cover applications for permission to appeal to the upper tribunal against first-tier tribunal rulings.
The MoJ said it was “no longer reasonable to expect the taxpayer to fund around 75% of the costs of immigration and asylum proceedings”. Earlier this year the justice secretary, Michael Gove, announced steep increases in probate fees.
This week it was revealed that the MoJ had been forced to borrow £427m from the Treasury last year to cover the cost of a surge in sex offence trials and an unexpected shortfall in fees from other sources.
Defending the need for the latest increases, the justice minister Dominic Raab said: “We must reduce the burden on the taxpayer of running our courts and tribunals. In meeting our spending review settlement, all parts of the Ministry of Justice must contribute to the national effort to reduce the deficit and restore the government's finances to surplus.
“The courts and tribunals service cost £1.8bn in 2014-15, but only £700m was received in income. This leaves a net cost to the taxpayer of around £1.1bn in one year alone.”
Raab acknowledged that many of the new fees already introduced would be higher than the cost of the hearings themselves. They said: “We have implemented enhanced court fees, above the cost of the proceedings to which they relate, for money claims, possession claims, general applications within civil proceedings, and divorce petitions.”
Some of the money will be used to invest in new technology for the courts. The government has promised £700m to drag the paper-reliant justice system into the computer age.
Raab added: “Our consultation proposes increasing fees in those immigration and asylum proceedings where a fee is payable so that the fee meets the costs of those proceedings in full.
“In light of the challenging financial circumstances we face we have already had to take difficult decisions … We are mindful of the fact that some applicants will face difficulties in paying these fees, so to make sure that the burden of funding the system is shared as fairly as possible we will continue to exempt from fees those in particularly vulnerable positions.”
The exemption is intended to include those who qualify for legal aid or asylum support, those who are appealing against a decision to deprive them of their citizenship and those children bringing appeals to the tribunal who are being supported by a local authority.
Children being housed by the local authority and the parents of children receiving local authority support will also be exempted.
Commenting on the proposals, Jonathan Smithers, the president of the Law Society, said: “It is fundamental to the rule of law that access to the courts and tribunals should not be determined by the ability to pay – the provision of justice should not be an accounting exercise. There is a serious risk that fee increases of 500% will prevent many people from challenging often incorrect Home Office administrative decisions about their entitlement to enter or remain in the UK.
“When employment tribunal fees were increased sharply many who had been wronged were discouraged from pursuing valid claims. Since June 2013 the number of employment tribunal cases has dropped by nearly 70% and our members have told us that many claimants with strong cases see the fee as a significant deterrent to seeking justice.
“The announcement follows recent significant increases in visa application fees which have generated additional revenue for the government.”
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: “The Tories are intent on pricing vulnerable people out of justice wherever they can find them.
“A high proportion of decisions are currently overturned on appeal.
“It would make more sense for the government to focus on getting the decision right first time round – saving time and money.”
In a separate development, the MoJ confirmed that, after losing a court of appeal challenge, it was relaxing the restrictions on the requirements victims of domestic violence face in claiming legal aid.
An MoJ spokesperson said: “We are determined to ensure victims of domestic violence can get legal aid whenever they need it. Following the court of appeal's judgment, we have acted quickly to change the domestic violence evidence arrangements.
“We have more than doubled the original time limit for evidence – increasing it from two to five years - and introduced a provision for the assessment of evidence of financial abuse.”
ASHBURN, Va. – The Washington Redskins have made at least one change to the starting defensive lineup – with a second likely to occur as well. But they're still uncertain about whom the one open job on offense.
Jeron Johnson will start ahead of Trenton Robinson at safety, defensive coordinator Joe Barry said Thursday. Johnson replaced Robinson during last week's 27-10 loss to New England.
“He's earned the right to play and he'll continue to play, no doubt,” Barry said.

Barry reiterated what coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday: Linebacker Will Compton will play a lot vs. New Orleans. It's likely that they will start, though it's uncertain who he'll replace, either Keenan Robinson or Perry Riley Jr. Robinson did not practice Wednesday because of a shoulder/neck issue and was limited Thursday, though any change would be more performance-related than due to injuries.
As for Johnson, they signed here this offseason thinking they would be a starter. The Redskins liked that they could play both safety positions, having backed up both starters in Seattle. But they lost the job to Duke Ihenacho and then when they missed time in camp with a hamstring injury, Johnson lost the backup role to Robinson.
Johnson had played in 24 snaps before Sunday when they played 45.
“I tip my hat to [Johnson],” Barry said. “He competed their butt off. I don't think things went the way they wanted them to, but they kept working, they kept battling.”
The Redskins also have Kyshoen Jarrett, who started at safety in college but has worked mostly at nickel corner this season. Jarrett continues to work at safety in practice. And he'll maintain a role from scrimmage defensively. However, if the Redskins corners are healthy then Jarrett's time will decrease. When at full strength, the Redskins would have Bashaud Breeland, DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver to man the three spots (with veteran Will Blackmon capable as well).
As for center, newly signed Brian de la Puenta is still getting caught up on the Redskins' offensive system and line coach Bill Callahan's blocking schemes. So the Redskins still aren't sure whether or not he'll start ahead of Josh LeRibeus Sunday.
Gruden said de la Puenta was a “little gassed” after practicing for the first time all season on Wednesday. Add to it the need to learn the offense and it's a tough task ahead of him.
“It's like trying to learn Spanish in a day. Very difficult,” Gruden said. “But he's getting there, man. He's a smart kid. We've just got to get them ready if we can, but we feel good about Josh playing center and de la Puenta being a backup.”

In the summer of 1998 or thereabouts -- dates are difficult to differentiate in the whorl of undergradute years -- I found an orange kitten huddled underneath my back porch.
It was winter and the kitten seemed starving, so I did what I could to introduce it into my household, which at the time consisted of one very angry and possessive woman who was having none of this interloper, so when my neighbors mentioned having lost their kitten the next day, it was better for everyone involved that they return home.
Two years and two kittens later -- the latter having been semi-almost-successfully integrated into the household -- my wife and I were returning from an ill-timed trip to the grocery store. The Louisiana rain did as Louisiana rain does, soaking everything beyond the telling of it and as my wife and I shuffled our groceries out of the car and into the house, a wet orange ball followed us in.
Without even bothering to introduce himself, the cat who would be Finnegan walked over to a food bowl and began eating.
Their silence -- as we would soon learn -- was unusual. They had, it seemed, been hungry for some time, so we took them in for the night. I checked with the neighbor the next day to see if they had misplaced their orange cat again, only to discover that my neighbor had moved.
Finnegan had not been welcome there anymore for reasons anyone who ever knew them would be incapable of understanding.
Granted, they did enjoy chewing through wires -- and the more expensive the equipment they were attached the better. But the attention being paid to the noises in the headphones was better spent on them and they needed you to know that.
But they aren't sure you did -- so they asked you questions. Finnegan always asked everybody questions, their voice rising into an interrogative with every subsequent mew. Because they were never satisfied with any answer and would engage you in an endless interrogation into matters only they understood fully.
I mention this because the house is so quiet and unquestioned since their passing. I walk around wondering why the world's allowed to just exist and am reminded of the absence of its inquisitor.
Most of the time I think they were asking whether this or that inedible substance was edible. We sometimes referred to them -- with love -- as "the Finnegoat" because they would eat anything and did so with evident relish. It was their waning appetite that clued us in to the fact that something was wrong, and that something, as is often the case with elderly cats, fell to their kidneys.
We managed their condition with medication for almost five months -- five months in which I should have spent more time with them -- but in the end they let us know their time had come with their silence.
The bright boy who once questioned the world quieted their investigative assault and we knew what we had to do.
Not that that made it any easier because nothing makes losing someone who had been a part of your daily life for fifteen years any easier.
Some mornings I swear I hear them demanding of the staircase knowledge of its steepness or inquiring of a cabinet a reckoning of its contents.
And so as I write this a few months after their passing, I can only ask myself -- exactly as they would have asked me -- what took you so long and why are your eyes leaking and I saw a thing and is it time to eat?
Former Sunderland star Julio Arca is set to play Northern League football after agreeing a deal to join South Shields.
The Argentine, who was a crowd favourite in their spell at the Stadium of Light between 2000 and 2006, played Sunday League football for Wearside pub the Willow Pond last season.
Arca ended their professional career after a seven-year spell at Middlesbrough came to an end in 2013, but the central midfielder, who can also play at left-back, says their competitiveness is as strong as ever.
 They are expected to be in attendance to watch their new Mariners team-mates take on Easington Colliery tomorrow, ahead of a potential debut next Saturday against Stokesley at Mariners Park.
The 34-year-old said: “I've been in talks with the manager, Jon King, and the chairperson Geoff Thompson for a while, and they're really excited about bringing the club up and progressing to make the club bigger.
“I want to bring some excitement to the club. The team is doing really well at the moment and are up near the top of the league, and hopefully we'll get even more fans excited enough to come and watch the games. The aim is to win the league.
“I came here before the season even started, so they told me all about what they're looking for and what the ideas are here. It's a long-term plan, so everything looked exciting.
“I'm really competitive in everything I do, so I want to win every game. That's how I was like last season playing Sunday League football with my friends.
“I was probably one of the most competitive in the team, because if I'm going to do something, I want to do it right.”
Arca watched South Shields for the first time in their pre-season friendly at Seaham Red Star in July, and was impressed with what they saw.
 They are now hoping attendances at Mariners Park – which are currently averaging 325 for league games this season – will rise even further.
Arca added: “Me being here will hopefully help the club. I know South Shields is half Newcastle and half Sunderland, but hopefully the Sunderland fans who saw me playing will follow me here and watch the games. That would be excellent.”
Cook Inlet Beluga Whales are usually seen from a distance, but several people have spotted them over the past few days in a place you might not expect: Ship Creek.

Moua Xiong captured a brief video of mother beluga and its calf, while they walked near Ship Creek on Sunday.
"I mean, I go there every week – three times a week sometimes," said Xiong. "And in the 20 years I've been up here, that was first time I've ever experienced anything like that. So it was pretty amazing, and I feel blessed."
Peter Scully also spotted the whales Sunday evening.
"Coming across the bridge, I noticed a beluga whale right in the middle of the creek," they said. "So I pulled the car slowly over to the side of the road, and got out with my camera."
Scully took several up-close photos of the whale and it's calf, as they slowly swam in the creek.
"It looked like the calf was foraging sort of from side to side," said Scully. "But it would always come back to the mom, and sweep over its back and look up towards the bridge. And so it was really exciting to watch."
Suzanne Steinert, with the Beluga Whale Alliance, says belugas will often swim in creeks, but it's unusual for people to see them that clearly.
"It's also really, really great to see such a healthy looking calf with a mom," Steinert said. "That means that these whales are calving in the wild, and that's hopefully good news."
Steinert cautions people, who might want to see the whales in Ship Creek, to remember that they are protected as an endangered species.
"Any effort that you make, if you try to get into the water to potentially get closer to the whales, could potentially be considered a form of harassment, which is illegal" Steinert said, adding that it's important to view them quietly at close range, since they are highly sensitive to sound.
The Beluga Whale Alliance encourages people, who spot the whales, to call the NOAA Marine Fisheries 24-hour hotline to report the sighting at (877) 925-7773.
What does French Pasta, Turkish Coffee (and its tradition), Mexican Michoacan, Korean Khimjang and Japanese Washoku have in common?
Aside from being one of the key components of their respective country's cuisine, these cultural driven traditional food items (and cooking style) are a part of the UNESCO Intangible Heritage Tag list. Thereby making them UNESCO protected and promoted sites of the food world that are now reason enough to visit the land.
Interestingly, these are only a handful of over 150-odd cultural activities that the arm of UNESCO has chosen since its first list of such ‘intangible' culture assets made its appearance in 2008.
Since then, this cultural arm of UNESCO has attracted many nations to bring out their innate cultural asset to be assessed by the team for its valid ancestry including Peru, whose annual mammoth food festival, Mistura, is a part of the country's effort at getting the Heritage tag.
Also aiming for the tag is China which is now preparing its application for the family cuisine of ancient philosopher Confucius (551-479 B.C.) to be enlisted as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage, much like Italy that wants its Neapolitan Pizza to get the tag. And in the coming year the list has gems like the Armenian Lavaash, Georgian traditional Qvevri wine-making method,Krakelingen and Tonnekensbrand, end-of-winter bread and fire feast at Geraardsbergen and the Mediterranean Diet. As the list suggests,the festival is likely to go big.

Which makes us wonder: What is the heritage tag? Who is eligible to get it? And more pertinently, why India – which already has 10 cultural activities including the Traditional Vedic Chanting, Ramlila, Chauu Dance and the Mudiyettu (Kerala Dance Drama) in its list – doesn't have even one of the culinary branches?
What adds to the curiosity is that Indian cuisine though has had many influences is also considered among the oldest culinary science in the world.
A heritage tag is a recognition that the particular dish, dance, ritual holds the key to the civilization, and has played an important role in shaping the society as it is today. Contrary to believe however the tag has nothing to do with a country's cuisine — nothing to do with the variety of dishes and cooking techniques — instead it associated with the cultural tradition of eating and drinking.
Take the case of Kimjang for instance. It is a ritual of making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea, and is a part of getting the society together to eat and drink. Likewise for Lavaash, the preparation, meaning and appearance of traditional bread as an expression of culture in Armenia; and the Washoku, which is Japan's traditional cooking embraces seasonal ingredients, a unique taste and a style of eating steeped in centuries of tradition.

Philippine shares erased early gains to close lower on Tuesday, extending losses to a fourth straight session, after President Rodrigo Duterte launched yet another tirade against the United States, while most other Southeast Asian markets ended lower.
President Duterte lashed out anew at the US expressing their resentment at having foreign troops in the Philippines and told the US to forget the bilateral defence deal if they stayed in power long enough.
Philippine shares closed 0.4% lower, weighed down by industrials and consumer discretionary stocks.
Property developer SM Prime Holdings was the biggest loser on the index, falling 2.8%, as strains in Washington-Manila ties impact the BPO-sector driven office property market.
Jollibee Foods Corp was the second biggest loser.
Indonesian shares were down around 0.4%, dragged down by financials and consumer non-cyclicals, with Astra International Tbk PT, down 1.5%, contributing most to the fall in terms of index points.
DxOMark just released their review of the HTC One M9's camera. I'm not going to beat around the bush, the results aren't great (not that any of us here at AP are all that surprised). The HTC One M9 scored a rather abysmal cumulative score of 69, placing the Taiwanese manufacturer's latest flagship in 22nd place on DxOMark's top mobile camera list.
That places the M9 21 spots behind the Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 Edge, which currently sits in the number one spot. The M9 also lags behind other ultra modern behemoths of the mobile photography world, such as the Amazon Fire Phone, the LG G2, the iPhone 4s, and the Samsung Galaxy S3. Ouch.
It's not all bad news for HTC though, they did outfit the M9 with a better camera than the M8...barely. The M9 scored just one point higher than the M8, which currently ranks 23rd. That, folks, is what you call an incremental update!
DxOMark's full review is quite exhaustive and a great read for anyone thinking about purchasing an M9. I won't break down the whole article here, but the pros and cons section at the end does a great job summing things up.
So, to summarize the summary, if lighting is bright, the M9 takes some pretty decent photos and video. If lighting is poor, your results are going to be substantially worse with less detail, inaccurate white balance, and oversaturation.
The results, and the rear facing camera in the M9, are disappointing to me. I really loved my M7 and wanted this to be the device to convince me to come back to HTC. With two small kids at home, having a fast and exceptional camera is an essential element in any phone I own and from what I have read and heard thus far, the M9 just doesn't cut it.
Perhaps some more software tweaking will make a difference in the future, but I'm not going to hold my breath. I hope HTC works things out with the M10, because I think they are running out of chances to impress in an increasingly competitive mobile world.
Bitcoin Bull Raises Bitcoin Price Target to $11,000
Bitcoin bull Ronnie Moas has raised their 2018 bitcoin price target to $11,000.
Moas, a respected market analyst at Standpoint Research, believes that recent announcements such as the introduction of bitcoin futures contracts by derivatives exchange operator CME Group will accelerate the pace of global bitcoin adoption ahead of their already-bullish target.
“Every day more headlines are hitting the newswires on crypto,” Moas wrote in a note emailed to clients. “More countries are embracing it and the few obstacles that were standing in the way are falling down like dominoes.”
This is not the only time Moas has raised their bitcoin price target in recent months. Earlier this year, they set a $5,000 bitcoin price target, which they later raised to $7,500 during the market's Q3 surge. Now, as the bitcoin price approaches that revised target, they have written a note to Standpoint clients advising them that they believe the bitcoin price will hit $11,000 in 2018.
But Moas does not think bitcoin will stop there. They expect that within 10 years at least 1% of all capital – an estimated $200 trillion – will move into crypto assets, raising the total cryptocurrency market cap tenfold to $2 trillion. Assuming bitcoin holds a 50% market share, the bitcoin price would be roughly $50,000. That's their conservative estimate.
My aggressive crypto market cap target is actually 2% within 5 years that would put the industry at $4 trillion dollars and bitcoin would be at 2 trillion (if it holds a 50% market share),” Moas continued. “The price would then be $120,000 and only 25% of where the gold market is today. Many people believe that Bitcoin will eventually catch up to gold($8 trillion) and I would not argue with that. $8 trillion would get bitcoin to $500,000.”
Bitcoin Not a Bubble
Elsewhere in the note, Moas addresses the litany of recent criticisms from entrenched financiers. Although Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein says they are “open” to bitcoin, other leading investment bankers have been far less conciliatory. UBS has called the market a “speculative bubble”, while JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon has lambasted it as an outright “fraud”.
Moa writes that these criticisms do not deter them from their positive outlook.
“What would we expect them to say?” they wrote. They're “heavily invested in the publicly traded U.S. banks that are threatened by cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not a scam and it is not in a bubble. You are more likely to find scams and bubbles in the U.S. stock market.”

In what could be called a Halloween costume work of art, "Ruined Spanish Fresco Monkey Jesus" is buzzing as one of this year's top getups.
Inspired by the gaffe of an elderly woman who failed to restore a 19th-century painting of the face of Jesus called "Ecce Homo," Reddit user Spinjump crafted their masterpiece, which they debuted at Anime Weekend Atlanta.
The creative mask captured perfectly the tilted and blurred face of the restored work, which some have renamed "Monkey Jesus." The costume's face even diminishes the nose and mouth of Christ, as in the botched restoration.
Images of the Halloween guise are making their way through the Internet today with the headline "2012 hot Halloween costume." On Twitter, some of the myriad of comments includes:
"Put away your Avengers outfits and Honey Boo Boo costumes. Best Halloween fancy dress this year, hands down." — Ryan Nelson, @RyanJohnNelson
"Excellent Restored Jesus Fresco Costume Game over. Can't top this. I'm going as a ghost." — princess stomper, @princessstomper
"The Hottest Halloween Costume for this year is clearly 'Monkey Jesus'. Though Steve Job's Ghost is still in the top 10." — Ryan G. Poirier, @RGPphotog
The failed restoration has caused a spike in visits to the church. So much so that the artist who blurred the face of Christ wants royalties.
They may not get any money, but they might get some satisfaction from knowing their handiwork has inspired a top costume.
Sarah Palin: Attacks On Gingrich Are Stalinist And “Alinskyite”
Sarah Palin isn't running for President, and they haven't officially endorsed anyone, but that hasn't stopped them from putting their thumb on the scale.
Doug Mataconis · · 33 comments
Not surprisingly, Newt Gingrich's screeds in which they attack the liberal media and identifies some unidentified “establishment” that they are somehow not a part of despite having been in Washington since 1979 are attracting the attention of that other professional grievance politician:
Newt Gingrich has a new unofficial campaign surrogate and their name is Sarah Palin. As the 2008 veep nominee sees it, Gingrich is getting a raw deal from the national media and conservative elite, the very same forces who conspired against them when they were on the national ticket. Palin hasn't endorsed Gingrich — and has no official role in their campaign — but they are repeatedly surfacing at just the right times on the national airwaves to vociferously defend him. In their latest appearance, Palin stated: “Look at Newt Gingrich, what's going on with them via the establishment's attacks,” they said, though the original question was about Ron Paul. “They're trying to crucify this man and rewrite history and rewrite what it is that they have stood for all these years.” Palin then called conservative writer Peggy Noonan “hypocritical” for recently calling Gingrich an “angry little attack muffin.” “They maybe subscribe such characterization of Newt via words like that, but they don't subscribe those to say Mitt Romney when they or their surrogates do the same thing,” they said. “That's that typical hypocrisy stuff in the media that I've lived with over a couple of decades in the political arena. So I'm used to it.” “But in order to help educate the rest of the American public, I'll articulate that it is hypocritical of the media to subscribe to one candidate and not another, that kind of angry attack muffin verbiage to one and not the other.” Though they declined to run for president in 2012, Palin still has a devoted following among tea party conservatives. Despite their non-endorsement, their views on the race have become crystal clear as they have waged an insistent public campaign for Gingrich that can't be mistaken for anything but support for the volatile speaker and their ideas. As has usually been the case with Palin, their exact motives remain a mystery. But it does seem like the two Republicans share a common bond in suspecting the media and Washington power brokers are biased against them. When asked about Palin's unofficial advocacy for them on Friday, Gingrich's campaign had no comment. But after Palin picked Gingrich in South Carolina, Gingrich spokesperson R.C. Hammond told NBC News: “We think it's a pretty darn clear call to arms.”
Earlier this week, when Romney supporter Chris Christie called Gingrich an embarrassment to the Republican Party, Palin suggested that the tough-talking New Jersey Governor had gotten their “panties in a wad.” Christe hasn't responded to that yet but, if and when they do, I'm sure the words will be memorable. Palin's latest attempt to insert themselves into a race they declined to enter and put their Alaskan thumb on scale for Gingrich came Friday night in a post to their Facebook page (how else?) in which they decried the GOP primary season's “cannibalism”:
What we saw with this ridiculous opposition dump on Newt was nothing short of Stalin-esque rewriting of history. It was Alinsky tactics at their worst. But this whole thing isn't really about Newt Gingrich vs. Mitt Romney. It is about the GOP establishment vs. the Tea Party grassroots and independent Americans who are sick of the politics of personal destruction used now by both parties' operatives with a complicit media egging it on. In fact, the establishment has been just as dismissive of Ron Paul and Rick Santorum. Newt is an imperfect vessel for Tea Party support, but in South Carolina the Tea Party chose to get behind them instead of the old guard's choice. In response, the GOP establishment voices denounced South Carolinian voters with the same vitriol we usually see from the left when they spew hatred at everyday Americans “bitterly clinging” to their faith and their Second Amendment rights. The Tea Party was once again told to sit down and shut up and listen to the “wisdom” of their betters. We were reminded of the litany of Tea Party endorsed candidates in 2010 that didn't win. Well, here's a little newsflash to the establishment: without the Tea Party there would have been no historic 2010 victory at all. I spoke up before the South Carolina primary to urge voters there to keep this primary going because I have great concern about the GOP establishment trying to anoint a candidate without the blessing of the grassroots and all the needed energy and resources we as commonsense constitutional conservatives could bring to the general election in order to defeat President Obama. Now, I respect Governor Romney and their success. But there are serious concerns about their record and whether as a politician they consistently applied conservative principles and how this impacts the agenda moving forward. The questions need answers now. That is why this primary should not be rushed to an end. We need to vet this. Pundits in the Beltway are gleefully proclaiming that this primary race is over after Florida, despite 46 states still not having chimed in. Well, perhaps it's possible that it will come to a speedy end in just four days; but with these questions left unanswered, it will not have come to a satisfactory conclusion. Without this necessary vetting process, the unanswered question of Governor Romney's conservative bona fides and the unanswered and false attacks on Newt Gingrich will hang in the air to demoralize many in the electorate. The Tea Party grassroots will certainly feel disenfranchised and disenchanted with the perceived orchestrated outcome from self-proclaimed movers and shakers trying to sew this all up. And, trust me, during the general election, Governor Romney's statements and record in the private sector will be relentlessly parsed over by the opposition in excruciating detail to frighten off swing voters. This is why we need a fair primary that is not prematurely cut short by the GOP establishment using Alinsky tactics to kneecap Governor Romney's chief rival.
This is all, of course, classic Palin. Attack the “establishment” and the media while defending a Tea Party that they latched themselves onto rather than actually helping to create. The irony of deploying that rhetoric in defense of a big government conservative whose record is about as far away from what the Tea Party claims to stand for as possible is apparently lost on the former Alaska Governor. The additional irony, though, is Palin accusing Gingrich's critics of employing “Alinsky tactics” against the former Speaker. The Republican obsession with Saul Alinksy is something deserving of a post in itself, at least, but it doesn't take much knowledge about the ideas of the late Chicago community organizer to know that the real Alinskyite in the Republican race is none other than Newton Leroy Gingrich:
Gingrich's clashes against the establishment are classic Alinsky. “The job of the organizer is to maneuver and bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack them as a ‘dangerous enemy,'” Alinsky wrote in “Rules for Radicals.” They went on to reveal that, “Today, my notoriety and the hysterical instant reaction of the establishment not only validate my credentials of competency but also ensure automatic popular invitation.” Though Gingrich has spent several decades profiting from being part of the Washington establishment, the fact that he's been attacked by so-called “elites” has become self-validating. And the way they scolded CNN moderator John King in last Thursday's South Carolina debate followed Alinsky's 13th tactical rule, which states: “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Alinsky argued that a faceless target such as City Hall, or in this case, the mainstream media, isn't as powerful of a target as individual person. And by “freeze it,” they meant that whoever the target is shouldn't be allowed to pin the blame on somebody else. King, as Fox's Juan Williams did in the prior debate, allowed Gingrich to personalize their attack on the media. And when King tried to claim that it was another network, ABC, that had aired the interview with their ex-wife that had prompted the question about whether they had ever sought an “open marriage,” Gingrich froze the target. “John, it was repeated by your network,” Gingrich hollered. “You chose to start the debate with it. Don't try to blame somebody else.”
If anyone has been employing Alinsky tactics over the past four years it's people like Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin, and they've ironically done it while making Alinsky themselves one of their enemies even though he's been dead for nearly 40 years.
Leaving aside the Alinsky arguments, though, Palin's argument is just absurd. First of all, to the extent Newt Gingrich has been “attacked” they have been “attacked” with the truth, whether its about their personal life, their tendency to engage in wild flights of fancy disguised as public policy discussions, their tenure as Speaker, the manner in which they single-handedly sought to betray the very Contract With America they asked their fellow Republicans to sign, or their actions in the years after they left Congress in which they sought to profit off their access to the corridors of power and lobby for big government. If this is who Palin and the Tea Party have latched on to as their candidate, then they are even bigger frauds then I thought they were.
Second, drawing distinctions between the candidates is exactly what primaries are supposed to be about. For some reason, it seems to be fine in the minds of Gingrich supporters like Palin for them to criticize Mitt Romney or Rick Santorum or Ron Paul, but when one of them, and most especially Romney and their surrogates, turns that same tactic back around and aims it at Gingrich, it somehow becomes “cannibalism” as Palin refers to it. This reminds one of the same kind of whining about the “Lamestream Media” that we have heard from Palin for years, along with a health dose of the blame they tried to cast on the McCain campaign staff for their own quite obvious failings as a Vice-Presidential candidate in their efforts to create an alternative history of the 2008 Presidential Campaign. If the “attacks” on Gingrich are truthful, and they have been, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with Romney and their supporters, or anyone else who happens to think that Newt Gingrich should not be the Republican nominee for President, from making them. It's up to the voters to decide how to evaluate them. That is what democracy is all about, isn't it?
Embrace the competition, candidates, that's what politics is all about. As for Ms. Palin, well, one wonders when they will realize how irrelevant she's actually become.

This cardboard-and-Sharpie sign is nailed up in our friends Alex & Emily's bathroom:
According to Emily:
“Alex and I were walking one evening in northwest DC and discovered a bunch of these signs (same misspellings and all) posted outside an embassy, I believe it was the Lebanese embassy. Since they had so many, we figured we could snatch one without them noticing.”
The sign is brilliant enough on its own, but I LOVE the thought of a cranky Lebanese diplomat stepping in dog shit once, and then scouring the embassy for scrap cardboard and scrawling out TONS of these things to put out all over the lawn. And possibly spending the rest of their day watching with one eye through parted curtains for trespassing dogs to yell at.

Zoran Kokot is a Serbian forward born on June 28, 1985 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Throughout their career they have played for Slavija and Olimpik in Bosnia, the CSL's Serbian White Eagles, Belgian side KSK Beveren and for Mes Sarchesme and Gol Gohar in Iran.
Recently, they have been linked with the Ottawa Fury and FC Edmonton. We caught up with Kokot to ask them on the possible move.
“I'd love to try my luck abroad again – specifically in Canada,” Kokot told RedNation. “My contract with FK Slavija expired this winter. We all know that the Bosnian league doesn't have money and that athletes here are barely surviving. The conditions are the same in both entities. The field conditions are terrible in most stadiums and that's unfortunately why the league can't advance. The fan-base is getting smaller but there are many talented players both young and old. When there are derby matches then the stands are full which is what true soccer needs.”
The 29 year old forward would bring experience to both the Fury or Edmonton should they make the move to the North American Second Division.
“I have phenomenal and unforgettable memories from Canada,” Kokot explained. “I remember Marc Dos Santos (now head coach of Ottawa Fury), who is both a good coach and person. I met them when I was on a five-day trial in Montreal for the Impact. It didn't come to fruition then but I would love to have an opportunity like that again.”
Kokot has one call-up for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team and was voted one of the country's best players in 2012 and 2013.
Gulf carriers may be in crosshairs under foreign airline US tax exemption cut
Reuters
CHICAGO: A US congressional proposal that would eliminate income tax exemptions for certain airlines could affect major Gulf carriers, potentially worsening an international spat between US airlines and their Middle East rivals.
US airlines have been petitioning the federal government for years to intervene in what they see as unfair competition by the three major Gulf carriers.
The proposal, tucked deep in the Senate tax-cut plan, calls for airlines headquartered in foreign countries to pay the US incorporate tax rate if: 1) the carrier's home country does not have an income tax treaty with the United States and 2) the carrier's country of origin has fewer than two arrivals and departures, per week, operated by major US airlines.
Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways have for years been accused by US competitors of being illegally subsidized by their governments. The Gulf carriers deny the accusation.
They could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.
If the proposal passes, it could leave the Gulf carriers more vulnerable because their home countries – the UAE and Qatar – do not have income tax treaties with the US, according to the Internal Revenue Service website.
A number of nations could possibly also be affected at a time when perceived discrepancies in US trade agreements are facing a critical eye from US corporations and the federal government.
The language in the Senate proposal sets the stage for a crackdown in tax leniency for these and other airlines. This would likely be well-received by American carriers, which have for years petitioned the US government to intervene in the dispute.
Under US tax treaties, entities of foreign countries are either exempt or pay a reduced rate on their income, and vice versa for US entities abroad. Reciprocity agreements, however, are less formal deals that fall short of an official accord, according to tax attorney Sam Brotman of Brotman Law.
“Reciprocity agreements are usually with countries that are not necessarily 100 percent friendly with the US” Brotman said on Thursday. “We'll call it a handshake deal.”
The bill's wording stands to ramp up an already tense battle between US airlines and Gulf carriers.
The addition was introduced by US Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia. Delta Air Lines, one of the most vocal critics of Gulf carrier practices, is headquartered in Atlanta.
A spokesperson for Isakson did not mention the Gulf airlines. “This provision supports American jobs by providing a level playing field and mutual fairness in international passenger aviation,” Isakson spokesperson Marie Gordon said in an email on Thursday.
“Foreign airlines should not receive preferential tax treatment if their countries choose not to open their markets to US companies.”
Delta declined to comment.
Pistons rookie Stanley Johnson shares their frustration with LeBron James and the Cavaliers, saying James should trash talk when the score is 0-0, instead of when their team is up by 16. (0:40)
CLEVELAND -- Detroit Pistons rookie Stanley Johnson didn't hold back in their assessment of how they think they have defended Cavaliers star LeBron James over the first two games of their Eastern Conference first-round series.
"I'm definitely in their head, that's for sure," Johnson said after a 107-90, Game 2 loss to the Cavs. "That's for sure."
Johnson, a 19-year-old from the University of Arizona, has been outspoken the past few days about their feelings that they could give James some problems defensively.
James was 12-for-18 from the field Wednesday and scored 27 points, but Johnson said they felt they held their own.
"I could care less if I'm in their head or in their mind or anything like that," Johnson said. "I'm just trying to play basketball. It's up to them how they want to react to whatever they do. I think I'm in a good place. They had a great night. He's had a couple great nights. They made a couple tough-ass shots.
"He hit two 3's, which is not, like, their norm. They hit a tough-ass turnaround on me, and they played really physical. I battled physical. They didn't get any paint touches. They made a bunch of tough shots. So he's going to have to go 40 minutes and make those same tough shots every game for them to do what they did tonight."
According to ESPN Stats & Information, James has scored 15 points on 7-for-9 shooting against Johnson as their primary defender in the series. James was 6-for-6 against Johnson for 13 points on Wednesday.
Johnson was asked about a moment in the first quarter Wednesday night, when it appeared they and James bumped each other. Johnson felt that James initiated the contact.
"I don't know what y'all take from that," Johnson said. "I don't take anything from it. But a cheap-ass shot, a cheap-ass bump. I don't know."
James, who spoke to reporters before Johnson made their comments, avoided assigning blame when asked about the bump.

"For me, like I always tell you guys, the game is played in between the four lines, and everything outside that means absolutely nothing," James said. "I'm just happy I'm able to be in a position where I can lead this team and try to make plays for myself, make plays for my teammates and come out the way we did tonight."
James did take exception to being hit by Marcus Morris' elbow in the fourth quarter. There's a video circulating of James taking issue with the hit and mouthing a threat.
"There hasn't been one dirty play in the series,'' James said, downplaying the teams' dislike for each other. "I will make sure my guys understand that we're here to play basketball. Everything else is irrelevant. There's a video here, a video there -- means absolutely nothing. I took a shot, but I'm OK, I'm still standing tall."
Johnson said James has talked some trash to them when they have been paired up, also taking a shot at the rest of the Cavaliers' roster.
"He jabbers," Johnson said of James. "He moves their mouth sometimes. Their whole team does, kind of like their little cheerleaders on the bench. Every time you walk in the right corner. They're always saying something like they're playing basketball, like they're actually in the game. There's only seven or eight players who play. I don't see why the other players are talking. They might as well just be in the stands, in my opinion."
Johnson thought that the timing of James' words could be better.
"I wish they would just talk when [the game] is 0-0, not when he's up 16," Johnson said. "I think that's more -- that means something. That means you're confident in yourself. You believe what you're about to do. Don't talk after you made a couple shots. Anybody can do that."
Asked why Johnson wasn't scared of James, as many other players would be in their situation, especially in the playoffs, Johnson responded with a question of their own.
"Why would I be?" Johnson said.
When told they had never been on the playoff stage and that there weren't many players like James, Johnson wasn't fazed.
"He laces their shoes up the same way I lace my shoes up," they said. "He has to come out there and compete and make their shots. They don't come prepared. That's the NBA. Anybody and everybody can get busted any night. From the last guy on the bench to the first guy out. He's going to have to strap their shoes in every night tight because I'm going to strap my shoes in every night tight.
"I'm going to play hard and compete every night as much as I can. Like I said before, he's a great player. I never took that away from him. I never said anything about that. I just said I'm going to compete every night and give my hardest effort every night and live with it. They make shots like they did tonight and plays like they did tonight, ain't many people in the league, ever, probably ever, that can match that. So it is what it is. They had a great game, and move on."
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
Massachusetts gun stores are attempting to redefine their businesses in the weeks since the state's attorney general effectively ended the sale of all AR-15s and AK-47s in the state.
Per the measure, any vendors who continued selling the so-called “copycat” firearms violated the ban and could face fines, prison time and/or lose their Federal Firearms License.
Greg Malany, owner of GFA ArmsTec, said the outright ban sent their shop into utter chaos as they had only a few hours to move their remaining inventory.
“There was no warning,” Malany told The Milford Daily News. “It came completely out of left field.”
While Tombstone Trading Company moved residual inventory into online sales to out of state residents, Guns-Inc told Guns.com they are concentrating on other firearms moving forward.
“We will concentrate on handgun sales more instead of the combined semi-auto rifle and handgun sales,” Kensall Knapik, owner of Guns-Inc said in an email.
Nick's Sport Shop owner Mario Torchia said the now restricted firearms encompassed about 10- to 15-percent of their stock. They told local reporters that the measure's murky language and unclear definitions has their team struggling to define what they can stock.
“We're still trying to figure out is this gun legal, is that gun legal?” Torchia told MassLive. “It's still not that clear. There are still a lot of questions on the mechanism of the guns, what falls into that class.”
Mass. AG Maura Healey shocked Second Amendment supporters when they issued the directive on July 20.
“Gun manufacturers have manufactured these weapons as legal versions of prohibited guns,” Healey told reporters. “These weapons are illegal. They are copies or duplicates of banned weapons, and they cannot be bought or sold in Massachusetts.”
“The gun industry doesn't get to decide what's compliant (with state law),” Healey added. “We do.”
A wave of panicked customers flocked to local gun shops after the announcement in an attempt to get their hands on the soon-to-be outlawed weapons.
The line to get into Four Seasons gun shop in Woburn extended into the parking lot. Mass Firearms School in Holliston extended its hours to 11:59 p.m. to accommodate the influx of buyers. The store went so far as to issue an email blast to customers reminding them, “Today is your LAST DAY to purchase a semi-automatic rifle in Massachusetts!”
According to information from the state's Firearms Records Bureau over 2,500 rifles were sold the day Healey announced the ban. In comparison, just 132 were sold the day before.
Gun rights supporters also turned up in droves to rallies at the state capital. One of the demonstrations, organized by the Gun Owners' Action League and attended by gun rights supporters including the Massachusetts' Rifle Association, garnered thousands of protesters.
The association, one of the nation's oldest active gun clubs, has been vocal about its disdain for the ban and the manner in which Healey accomplished it. The group told Guns.com that the lack of clarity and sweeping language creates a dangerous level of uncertainty that should concern all 2A supporters.
“If allowed standing, this creates an intolerable precedent. This allows a single individual to redefine a law 22 years after being passed. It declares that otherwise lawful members of society are now felons based on them following the law of the land for the last 22 years,” the group told Guns.com via Facebook. “This is not the creation of a new law, it's the destruction of the rule of law.”
The organization urged Facebook followers and members to continue to protest Healey's measure.
Gun Owners' Action League also spoke out against Healey. In a statement published to their website, the group condemned the sudden directive.
“Now, suddenly, without warning or any due process a single person with a clear political agenda decides to change the rules,” the statement read. “All Massachusetts residents should be alarmed.”

I'd like to make an observation about the George Zimmerman case. I'm going to preface my observation by stating that I studiously avoided coverage of the trial.
I have read a number of conservative commentaries on the affair. They denounce the media, governor, prosecutors, and judge. They stick up for Zimmerman, claiming that they acted in self-defense. They draw attention to Martin's rap sheet.
However, in the midst of all that, they usually include a caveat: they hasten to add that Martin's death was "tragic."
I'd like to consider that for a moment. In one sense I agree. Hypothetically speaking, their death was tragic because we can imagine better outcomes. What if they had lived long enough to turn their life around?
Christianity is a redemptive religion, so we celebrate redemptive story endings. And even secular filmmakers like redemptive story endings.
Measured by that counterfactual, their death was tragic. But, of course, there are other counterfactual outcomes that go in the opposite direction. And, if anything, these may be more probable.
We tend to think it's tragic that someone dies at 17. Their death was "untimely." "Premature." A life cut short. Think of all the lost opportunities. They had their whole life ahead of him. But whether or not that's tragic depends in part on what the decedent would have done with those opportunities.
What if Tamerlan Tsarnaev had died at 17? Would that be tragic? Well, it might seem tragic at the time. But if we knew where their life was headed, that would not be tragic.
Likewise, if a suicide bomber accidentally detonates the device before reaching their destination, thereby killing themselves instead of the target, is that tragic? It's tragic that they were talked into becoming a suicide bomber. It's tragic that they wasted their life on an evil mission. But there's an obvious sense in which their death is a good thing.
What if Martin was going from bad to worse? What if they were on a familiar trajectory of escalating violence? What if they were a murderer waiting to happen?
Under that scenario, there's an obvious sense in which their death was not a tragedy. Rather, their death forestalled real tragedy in the making. If, sooner or later, they were going to kill one or more innocent men, women, and/or children, then Zimmerman's bullet prevented a tragedy. If a junior hoodlum is on the cusp of becoming a truly dangerous thug, then the fact that they died at 17 rather than 30 is a relief. Think of all the prospective victims who were spared their life of crime.
Now you might say that's speculative. True. But, then, calling their death "tragic" is no less speculative, for we don't know how the alternative ending.
Bodega Marine Lab research coordinator Jacqueline Sones and ecology professor Eric Sanford often walk the beaches of the North Coast, looking for interesting or unusual things to photograph or take back to the lab. For the last two years, with sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific at unusual highs, they've found lots of creatures that normally live much further south, in more tropical water. One thing they hadn't found was a living pelagic red crab – until late January, when one of their regular walks along the beach at the mouth of Salmon Creek turned up several of the rare visitors.
“The funny part is that we didn't know when we first found one if it was alive or not,” Sones says. “We were taking pictures of the crab then touched it and it moved! Our next thought was, are there any others, so we walked down the beach and found others washed up along the high tide line. It was very exciting, like an Easter egg hunt.”
Pelagic red crabs, also known as tuna crabs or red crabs because of their color, are usually found off Baja California. Despite their name the crabs are a species of squat lobster, easily identified by their bright color, large eyes, small size, and a tail, which is usually tucked under their bodies.

Sones and Sanford have found parts of these crabs at Salmon Creek Beach before, but never a live one. While there have been sightings over the past few years in Monterey County and Newport Beach, there has not been a live sighting of red crabs north of Monterey since 1985, following the 1982-1983 El Niño. Like the sighting in 1985, Sones says, this winter's appearance of red crabs seems to be a result of the most recent El Niño.
“We believe it's an indication of the strength of the 2015- 2016 El Niño,” they say. “Looking back at records it was one of the strongest El Niños, and we believe its strength is what pushed southern species further north.”
Sones and Sanford kept 18 of the crabs at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab to study them further, including observing mated pairs to watch their behavior and embryo development. They hope more information might help them understand whether the crabs might stick around by indicating whether the crabs can reproduce in the colder water of Northern California, or if they just made the trip as juveniles.
When they looked with a microscope, Sones and Sanford also found hitchhikers riding along with the crabs: hydrozoans in the genus Obelia. Obelia have two stages of life: a sessile stage, in which they live attached to other objects, and a medusa stage, in which they are free-swimming. “It's not atypical for ocean animals to have things growing on them, but we have not seen any other appearance of these things on these crabs, and not all of the crabs we found have them,” Sones says. “For us it's more intriguing.”

Sanford and Sones also found a half dozen Janthina umbilicata, or purple sea snails, on the same day. Purple sea snails are pelagic snails that float at the surface on rafts made of bubbles, which they create themselves. Much like the crabs, they are rare species to find in Northern California. The snails, ranging from a half-millimeter to about 7 or 8 mm in size, get their name from their beautiful purple shells. And their arrival on the beach at the same time as the crabs seems to be another indicator of the strength of the 2015-2016 El Niño. “We had seen them from January 2016 to June 2016, and none since, so them showing up now was a surprise,” Sones says. “They could have lived in a similar area and been influenced in a similar way, by ocean and currents.
“It's an exciting time of year,” they add. “Lots of exciting potential for newer species with the combination of the El Nino, oceanography, and strong flow through north during winter time.”
With the water cooling down now, however, it's unlikely there will be another sighting of live pelagic red crabs this far north again for a while, Sones says. At least until the next El Niño.

Google Express began deliveries in New York in May and will debut in D.C. Oct. 14. (PHILIP MONTGOMERY/courtesy Google)
Google made its name finding things for people on the Internet. Now it is offering to bring them to your doorstep.
Beginning Oct. 14, the tech giant will expand its Google Express same-day delivery service in D.C., Boston and Chicago, after launching it a year ago in Northern California and expanding to Los Angeles and Manhattan this spring.
The service, which is being re-branded from Google Shopping Express, allows desktop, mobile or tablet users to order items from a variety of stores and — provided they are within a designated service area — receive the goods later that day. The service is similar to one that Amazon.com has begun offering in about a dozen metropolitan areas.
Locally, Google Express will be available only for locations in the District of Columbia initially. It will offer goods from nine stores: Giant Food, Costco, Walgreens, Sports Authority, Staples, Babies “R” Us, Barnes & Noble, L'Occitane and Guitar Center.
New shoppers are offered three months of membership for free and beyond that are asked to either pay $95 for an annual membership, $10 per month for a monthly membership or $4.99 per order, provided those orders are for at least $15 and meet certain criteria.
D.C. was chosen as a testing ground in part because of the number of locals who are pressed for time and accustomed to completing errands on their smart phones, said Brian Elliott, head of Google Shopping Partnerships. They offered working mothers as an example.
“Working moms are a pretty core consumer of this because if you can think of anyone who would like more time back in their day it's working moms,” they said. “But we want this to be available to everybody.”
Many of the retailers are already partners of Google's on Internet advertising. To include them in Google Express, Google outfits the stores with software to respond to orders and sends third-party delivery trucks to stores for pick-ups. Delivery vehicles and bags are branded with the service's parachute logo.
Elliott said the service was a natural extension of Google's interest in providing easy-to-use technology to connect businesses with consumers.
“We see places where there are long-term needs in the market to create really great user experiences, where given our tech know-how and our reach with users, that we can help make these things happen for merchants in a way that would be very hard for them to do on their own,” they said.
The expansion puts Google more squarely in competition with Amazon, which has been expanding same-day delivery and now has a grocery service, Amazon Fresh, that is available in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle areas. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
A bevy of start-ups are getting into the mix as well. Postmates expanded its on-demand service to parts of the District last year and Instacart began offering its grocery delivery service locally this February.
Even Macy's, the 156-year old department store chain, announced recently that it was testing same-day delivery in eight large metropolitan areas, including Washington, using the Deliv service.
Giant Food will be offering Google Express to shoppers even though it has its own in-house delivery service, Peapod, though it typically does not offer same-day delivery.
Giant, based in Landover, is the top grocery seller by market share in the area and will begin filling Google Express orders from two stores, in Brentwood and Shaw, located in Zip Codes that fit Google's preferences, according to Giant spokesperson Jamie Miller.
Miller said trying Google Express alongside Peapod fit with the company's strategy to try multiple e-commerce strategies to meet customers needs.
“The retail landscape is changing fast and customers are looking for more options, including same-day delivery,” they said.
