Chiesa di Santa Maria in Valle Porclaneta (Italian for Church of Santa Maria in Valle Porclaneta) is a Romanesque church in Rosciolo dei Marsi (a frazione of the comune of Magliano de' Marsi), in western Abruzzo, central Italy.
History
The church of Santa Maria in Porclaneta Valley is mentioned for the first time in an 11th century document, when the monastery passed under the jurisdiction of the Montecassino Abbey. It is located on the slopes of Monte Velino, at 1022 meters above the sea level.
The plan of the church, which is in Romanesque style, consists of a central nave ending in an apse; this is separated by two smaller naves by arcades. Before the entrance is a pronaos, which used to lead to the monks' rooms, now partially collapsed. Inside the church is preserved a ambon and a ciborium dated 1150, both attributed to the master Nicodemus; furthermore, there are the remains of the iconostasis that used to separate the presbytery from the hall reserved to the congregation, painted with frescoes.
The ambon is in stone covered by stucco, with a squared pulpit built over trilobed arches, in turn supported by small octagonal columns. The capitals are decorated with human figures mixed with vegetable representations. The sides of the upper pulpit are in turn sculpted with diacons and scenes from the Old Testament, including David fighting the bear and Jonah devoured by the whale. The decoration is similar to that in the church of Santa Maria del Lago at Moscufo, also in Abruzzo.

"The Way That I Love You" is a song recorded by American singer Ashanti from their fourth studio album, The Declaration (2008). It was released as the album's lead single on February 26, 2008, through Universal and The Inc. Ashanti wrote and produced the song with L.T. Hutton. Backed by piano, guitar, and horns, "The Way That I Love You" is a midtempo R&B ballad whose lyrics tell of betrayal.
Critical response was primarily positive; some reviewers said it was a highlight from The Declaration while others felt it was inferior to music released by Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige. Commercially, the song peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and appeared on the publication's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Adult R&B Songs component charts. Ashanti performed "The Way That I Love You" at Sessions@AOL and on tour.
Kevin Bray directed the music video which tells the story of Ashanti and their boyfriend—he cheats on her, they discover it, and they murder him. The story for the video was inspired by the true crime TV shows Snapped and Forensic Files. The video's emphasis on violence attracted critical attention. As part of the song's promotion, Ashanti launched a website that allowed users to create and send a personalized news report and death threat to a contact. The campaign was received negatively and incited a protest in Los Angeles. The website was ultimately taken down.
Background and release
For their fourth studio album The Declaration (2008), Ashanti collaborated with songwriters and producers outside of their record label Murder Inc. Them previous album Concrete Rose (2004) had been overshadowed by negative news regarding the label, including a feud with G-Unit and an FBI investigation. L.T. Hutton produced a majority of The Declaration, instead of Ashanti's longtime producer Irv Gotti. Ashanti said that they had more artistic freedom with the album. Hutton and Ashanti wrote and produced "The Way That I Love". Ashanti said that they "just started jotting down words, and it just kind of poured out" upon hearing the opening instrumental. They produced the lead and background vocals, and Hutton programmed the song and played the instruments. The final version was mixed at Brandons Way Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California.
"Switch", which featured Nelly, and "Hey Baby (After the Club)" were both announced as the album's lead single in 2007. They were replaced by "The Way That I Love You", which was released to urban radio on February 26, 2008, and rhythmic radio on April 1, 2008. It was the number one most-added song on urban radio in the week of its release. The single was included on a July 2008 Cartier charity playlist created to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization.
Composition and lyrics
"The Way That I Love You" is a midtempo R&B ballad that lasts four minutes and thirty seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a "moderate hip-hop" tempo. The instrumentation is provided by a piano, a guitar, and horns; Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the single is "driven by a distinct descending piano arpeggio and horn arrangement".
Ashanti's vocal range spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of E5. AllMusic's Andy Kellman compared their vocals to their 2003 single "Rain on Me" because of their similar "melodramatic flourishes" but said the lyrics of "The Way That I Love You" were "much more vengeful in nature than depressive." Ashanti felt both men and women would relate to the single's theme of betrayal.
Reception
"The Way That I Love You" was praised by critics who identified it as a highlight of The Declaration. The New York Daily News Jim Farber felt Ashanti's collaboration with Hutton was their best work, and described "The Way That I Love You" as a "strut of a song." Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader noted the song's piano loop as one of the few standouts from the album. A Dayton Daily News reviewer summed up the single as "cliche but effective."
On the other hand, some commentators negatively compared "The Way That I Love You" to music released by other singers. Despite praising Ashanti's performance as emotional, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly found the single to be inferior to those by Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige. Vibe's Shanel Odum dismissed the song as "barely set[ting] off a smoke detector, let alone ring[ing] any alarms", in a reference to Beyoncé's 2006 single "Ring the Alarm".
Commercially, "The Way That I Love You" peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on May 17, 2008, and remained on the chart for 18 weeks. It reached number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart, and number 18 on the Adult R&B Songs component charts compiled by the same publication.
Music video
Ashanti debuted the Kevin Bray-directed music video on 106 & Park and it was played on BET, MTV Hits, and MTV Jams. It was uploaded on Ashanti's YouTube account on December 22, 2009. A rough cut had leaked a few weeks before its premiere in February 2008. Another version of the video, with the subtitle "Access Denied", was released on Ashanti's YouTube account on November 22, 2009. Ashanti used the true crime TV shows Snapped and Forensic Files as the primary inspiration for the video. They felt that the storyline of a woman driven to murder fit the single's dramatic, painful, and emotional lyrics. They said that they wanted the video to be "very cinematic as opposed to a regular music video" to make a larger impact after their absence from the music industry. When discussing the overall message, Ashanti said: "Don't cheat."
Throughout the video, Ashanti is shown in a volatile relationship with their boyfriend, played by actor Christian Keyes. After learning about their infidelity, the singer poses with a butcher's knife while dressed in an evening gown. Images of evidence, including a bloody knife, footprints, and walls, intercut the video. It ends when Ashanti leaves their partner after killing them in a bathtub.
The video received critical attention for its representation of violence. In a 2015 article for The Atlantic, Kornhaber said it was part of a trend in music videos of violent female pop artists who want to avoid being presented as the victim. A Boombox contributor summarized the video as "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." The music video was popular on MTV.com and Total Request Live where it peaked at number one and two, respectively.
Promotion
Promotional campaign
A publicity stunt was coordinated with the music video's release through Ashanti's website (TheWayThatILoveYou.com). The website allowed a user to create and send a personalized news report and a death threat to a contact. The message, stylized as a "gotcha-gram", featured a news report about a series of murders inspired by "The Way That I Love You" music video and the upcoming release of The Declaration. The message could be customized to include the victim's name and crime, the murder weapon, and the sender's name and home state. The choices for crimes were sleeping around, suspected sleeping around, playing you like a fool, and breaking your heart. The weapons included a boot, knife, can, sledgehammer, rolling pin, and a guillotine. The news report ends with the disclaimer, "Ashanti and Universal Music Group do not encourage or condone violence of any kind. This is for parody purposes only." Each message was attributed to the fictional Universal Crime Network. An example of a gotcha-gram, sent to CNN's Lola Ogunnaike, was: "Do you know the person pictured in the following video. If so, please contact me immediately. Your life might be in danger."
The campaign received a primarily negative response. The civil rights organization Project Islamic Hope and the think tank Industry Ears led a protest that called for the website's removal. These groups felt that the project encouraged violence as a valid means to handle disputes. Ogunnaike deemed the messages "disturbing", and felt that they damaged Ashanti's public image as a "good girl". Universal closed the site, but Ashanti defended it as "a better alternative to actual violence" and "an incredible online viral tool." Ashanti's publicist, Michelle Huff, clarified that the video was intended to have a similar tone to a Saturday Night Live sketch and said that the singer had received primarily positive feedback for the site. Shanti Das, Motown's vice president for urban marketing, referred to the campaign as a parody of the music video and said that Ashanti does not promote violence against women.
Live performances
Ashanti promoted "The Way That I Love You" with a live performance at a 2008 Sessions@AOL. In 2016, they sang it as part of the Natural Born Hitters Tour with rapper Ja Rule. The Boomboxs Liz Ramanand said the performance was a highlight from the show. Ashanti subsequently included the song on the setlist for a 2018 tour with Ja Rule. Victor D. Infante of Telegram & Gazette praised them for providing a "soulful rendition" of the single and their decision to provide "an air of vulnerability" by singing it without backup dancers.

Marcus-Meriden-Cleghorn Community School District (MMC) is a rural public school district in Iowa. The district under the name, "MMCRU Schools", operates an elementary and high school in Marcus, while the Remsen Union Community School District operates an elementary school and a middle school in Remsen.
Marcus-Meriden-Cleghorn is mostly in Cherokee County with a portion in Plymouth County. It serves Marcus, Meriden, and Cleghorn.
History
The district formed on July 1, 1993, as a result of the merger of the Marcus and Meriden-Cleghorn school districts.
The district inherited the Cleghorn School, which first opened in 1920. By 2015 the school had 90 students in grades 4–6. In 2015 the district voted to close the school in order to have a yearly savings of $130,000. Students were redirected to Marcus.
Circa 2014 the MMC and RU districts began negotiating over a grade-sharing agreement, but the talks ended in 2014 by mutual agreement. The two districts prepared for budget cuts. Greg Forbes of the Sioux City Journal wrote that "Residents of both districts have lobbied to keep their respective high schools." The two districts reached out to other potential grade-sharing parties in the meantime. By June 2015 the MMC and RU districts resumed talks, and the districts ultimately reached an agreement regarding the grade sharing.
In 2016 the districts began grade-sharing, and the two together operate under the name "MMCRU Schools". The "Royals" were the chosen mascot. As part of the arrangement, both districts have their own elementary schools, with RU having a combined middle school and MMC with the combined high school. Breeanna Pearce of the Le Mars Daily Sentinel wrote that "Initially, the program met with some harsh criticism", and that there were fewer administrators, but that due to a successfully merging of operations, "MMCRU continues to gather support." The MMCRU is not yet legally a district.

The district formerly operated its own elementary, middle, and high school.

The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist is located in the city of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
The Anglican parish in the Diocese of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador was founded in 1699 in response to a petition drafted by the Anglican townsfolk of St. John's and sent to Henry Compton, Bishop of London. In this petition, the people also requested help in the rebuilding of their church, which had been destroyed, along with the rest of the city, in 1696 by the French under the command of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.
During the centuries, at least six wooden churches stood on or near this site; each was destroyed by military operations during the various wars between the French and the British. The British finally won control of eastern North America.
History
Construction of the first stone church was begun in 1843 under the direction of Aubrey Spencer, the first Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda. Little progress was made on this relatively modest edifice beyond the laying of a cornerstone before Spencer resigned due to ill health.
The present cathedral was begun in 1847 by Edward Feild, the second Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda. Feild commissioned plans from a leading Gothic Revival architect, George Gilbert Scott, who envisioned a more impressive cruciform structure, with varied ornamentation in the 12th-century English style. The nave, built between 1847 and 1850, served as the entire cathedral church for 35 years. Scott's assistant, architect William Hay, oversaw the nave's construction. In the City of Hamilton, in Pembroke Parish (where St. John's Church was already the parish church), Bermuda, a chapel-of-ease (designed by James Cranston of Oxford in 1844 and completed in 1869) named Trinity Church was also erected, with an adjacent Bishop's Lodge. This was destroyed by arson in 1884 and William Hay, who had been consulted on the construction of Trinity Church in 1848-1849 and again in 1862, was hired in 1885 with their partner, George Henderson, to design the current structure, which was completed in 1905 and became the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity when the Bishop of Bermuda was established as separate from the Bishop of Newfoundland in 1919).
Construction on the choir and transept section did not commence until 1880 and was completed in September 1885, under the direction of James Butler Knill Kelly. The additions to the nave gave the cathedral the shape of a Latin cross. It continued the era of Gothic Revival architecture in the construction of nineteenth-century Anglican churches in Newfoundland.
On July 8, 1892, in an unhappy coincidence to the fate of its chapel-of-ease in Bermuda, the Cathedral was extensively damaged in the Great Fire of 1892. The roof timbers ignited, which caused the roof to collapse, bringing the clerestory walls and piers in the nave down with it. The intense heat caused the lead to melt in the glass windows, resulting in the complete destruction of all but two; the sole surviving window can be seen in the Sacristy. Restoration of the Cathedral commenced in 1893, again under Kelly's direction. By 1895, the Chancel and Transepts had been rebuilt, while the Nave reached completion in 1905. The restored cathedral is renowned internationally as one of North America's best ecclesiastical Gothic Revival structures. The church was re-consecrated in a service on September 21, 1905. A window in the restored Cathedral was dedicated to Kelly, who died in 1907.
The Te Deum Window was donated in 1952 in memory of Bermudian-born Sir Joseph Outerbridge by their family.
The Cathedral remains incomplete as the structure still lacks the spire which its designer, Scott, had envisioned. Although an engineering team has established that the proposed tower and steeple is structurally feasible, the cost was estimated to be $3,000,000. The clergy and parishioners remain committed to completing Scott's plans and are hopeful that they will see the spire erected.
The cathedral was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1979 as a nationally significant example of Gothic Revival architecture. The building was also designated as a Registered Heritage Structure by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1991, and a City of St. John's Heritage Building in 1989.
Design
The Cathedral stretches from the Great West Doors to the Sanctuary, with a -wide nave and a maximum width of at the transepts. Where nave and transept cross, the floor-to-ceiling height is ; outside, the roof stands high at the ridge.

Ireland
During the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, some republican leaders, including Patrick Pearse and Joseph Plunkett, contemplated giving the throne of an independent Ireland to Prince Joachim. Pearse and Plunkett thought that if the rising were successful and Germany won the First World War, an independent Ireland would be a monarchy with a German prince as king, like Romania and Bulgaria before it.
The fact that Joachim did not speak English was also considered an advantage, as they might be more disposed to learning and promoting the use of the Irish language.
In their memoirs, Desmond FitzGerald wrote:
"That would have certain advantages for us. It would mean that a movement for de-anglicisation would flow from the head of the state downwards, for what was English would be foreign to the head of the state. They would naturally turn to those who were more Irish and Gaelic, as to their friends, for the non-nationalist element in our country had shown themselves to be so bitterly anti-German.......For the first generation or so it would be an advantage, in view of our natural weakness, to have a ruler who linked us with a dominant European power, and thereafter, when we were better prepared to stand alone, or when it might be undesirable that our ruler should turn by personal choice to one power rather than be guided by what was most natural and beneficial for our country, the ruler of that time would have become completely Irish."
Ernest Blythe recalls that in January 1915 they heard Plunkett and Thomas MacDonagh express support for the idea at an Irish Volunteers meeting. Bulmer Hobson, secretary of the Volunteers, was among the attendees. No objections were made by anyone and Blythe themselves said they found the idea "immensely attractive".
Georgia
After Georgia's declaration of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Joachim was briefly considered by the German representative Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg and Georgian royalists as a candidate to the Georgian throne.
Lithuania
The Council of Lithuania declared Lithuania's independence on February 16, 1918, but the council was unable to form a government, police, or other state institutions due to the continued presence of German troops. The Germans presented various proposals to incorporate Lithuania into the German Empire, particularly Prussia.
One such proposal offered the crown of Lithuania to Joachim. The Lithuanians resisted this idea and hoped to preserve their independence by creating a separate constitutional monarchy. On 4 June 1918, they voted to offer the Lithuanian throne to the German noble Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach.
Divorce and death
Following the German Revolution in November 1918, the Emperor was forced to abdicate, thus depriving Joachim of their titles and position. Unable to accept their new status as a commoner, they fell into a deep depression.
The relationship between Joachim and their wife had already started to deteriorate. The couple were divorced soon after the end of the First World War. The direct causes of the divorce are not known to the public. According to one report, Marie-Auguste had previously abandoned their husband and child to run away with another man, had been forcibly brought back home on the orders of the Kaiser, and had filed for divorce as soon as the war ended, when they saw that their husband's family were at their lowest ebb.
Following the divorce, Joachim shot themselves in Potsdam on 18 July 1920. One source reports that they had been in financial straits and suffered from "great mental depression". Their own brother Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia commented that they suffered from "a fit of excessive dementia".
Children and grandchildren
The only issue of the marriage of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie-Auguste was their son, Prince Karl Franz Josef Wilhelm Friedrich Eduard of Prussia (15 December 1916 – 22 January 1975).
On 5 October 1940, Prince Karl married Princess Henriette Hermine Wanda Ida Luise von Schönaich-Carolath (25 November 1918 – 16 March 1972). They divorced on 5 September 1946. They were the parents of three children:
Prince Franz Wilhelm Viktor Christoph Stephan of Prussia (born 3 September 1943), they married Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia, a claimant to the disputed Russian throne. Their child is Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, Prince of Prussia, born 13 March 1981 in Spain.
Prince Friedrich Christian Ludwig of Prussia (3 September 1943 – 26 September 1943)
Prince Franz Friedrich Christian of Prussia (born 17 October 1944).
After the divorce, Prince Karl married, morganatically, Luise Dora Hartmann (5 September 1909 – 23 April 1961) on 9 November 1946. The childless couple divorced in 1959.
Prince Karl's last marriage was to Eva Maria Herrera y Valdeavellano (10 June 1922 – 6 March 1987) on 20 July 1959 in Lima, Peru. They were married until Prince Karl's death and had two daughters;
Alexandra Maria Augusta Juana Consuelo Prinzessin von Preussen (born 29 April 1960)
Désirée Anastasia Maria Benedicta Prinzessin von Preussen (born 13 July 1961).

Lada class, Russian designation Project 677 Lada (, meaning "Lada", NATO reporting name St. Petersburg) is the new advanced class of diesel-electric attack submarine designed by the Russian Rubin Design Bureau. A program to develop a "fourth generation" diesel-electric submarine, it aimed to produce a highly improved version of the Project 636 with better acoustic signature, new combat systems and possibly air-independent propulsion. However, in 2019, Alexander Buzakov, the head of the Admiralty Shipyard, indicated that there were no plans to equip the Lada class with an air-independent propulsion system. In July 2022 it was reported that work on an electrochemical generator to produce hydrogen from diesel fuel and oxygen was continuing and that the Rubin Central Design Bureau signed a new contract in 2019 to continue work. This was scheduled to be completed by the mid-2020s.
History
The lead boat of the class, named , was launched in October 2004 and began sea trials in November 2005. The submarine was transferred to the Russian Navy in April 2010.
Another two vessels were under construction at the Admiralty Shipyard with plans to launch four to six submarines by 2015. In 2009, the Russian Navy had set out a requirement for a total of eight St. Petersburg-class submarines.
However, in November 2011 the Russian Navy decided that this class of submarines would not be accepted into service, as the lead boat had fallen far short of requirements during tests. The lead boat was retained as a test vessel to experiment with various systems. The construction of the remaining boats of the class was frozen.
On 27 July 2012, the Russian Navy commander-in-chief announced the resumption of the construction of the St. Petersburg-class submarines, having undergone extensive design changes. In 2013 and 2015, two further boats were re-laid and commissioning was expected in 2017 and 2018.
On 20 September 2018, the first serial submarine of the class, B-858 Kronshtadt, was launched at the Admiralty Shipyards in St. Petersburg.
Indonesia had once indicated its interest in acquiring two St. Petersburg-class submarines, but the deal fell through before 2010 due to financing issues.
In June 2017, the Russian Navy announced it planned to order two more Lada-class submarines, and the build contract was signed in June 2019, during the International Military-Technical Forum «ARMY-2019». One more sub was ordered in August 2020, during the International Military-Technical Forum «ARMY-2020», with some speculation that all six of the submarines currently on order, or alternatively up to six of the eventual total number of Lada-class boats, might eventually be deployed with the Baltic Fleet.
Design
The project 677 St. Petersburg is a Russian diesel-electric submarine developed in the late 1990s. The submarine is designed for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, defense of naval bases, seashore and sea lanes, as well as for conducting reconnaissance. The class marks the first usage of a mono-hull design by the Russian navy for an attack submarine since the 1940s.
Displacement is 25% lower than that of its predecessor, the , but its capabilities are greatly enhanced. Top submerged speed is , up from s for the Kilo class. The class is designed for an endurance of 45 days with a complement of 35.
The submarine is equipped with automated combat control system Litiy, (eng. "Lithium").
A variant designated as the project 1650 is offered as an export model.

The A4050 road connects Barry, Vale of Glamorgan with Culverhouse Cross on the outskirts of Cardiff, Wales. It is approximately long, and is the key link road between the M4 motorway and Cardiff International Airport.
2008 road improvements
Wenvoe village lies along the road. In 2008 the Welsh Assembly allocated £576,000 to road resurfacing and improvement, which as of 2012 was still ongoing. One area given specific attention is the area around Pencoedtre between Waycock Cross and Barry as housing development and a new crematorium has been created in recent times.
Culverhouse Cross
At Culverhouse Cross, the A4050 connects to the A48 and the A4232. The A48 links with Cowbridge and to Cowbridge Road West which connects the western Cardiff district of Ely to Canton and the city centre. The A4232 links with the M4 at junction 33 and Cardiff Bay.
History
Original 1932 route
In 1932, the A4050 was a short road along the Rhymney Valley, connecting Bargoed with the A4049 in both directions.
Starting on the A4049 at Pengam, the road headed west across the river before turning northwards. The road ran through the centre of Bargoed before detouring west to cross the narrow Darran Valley. After rejoining the Rhymney Valley the road continued upstream via Brithdir to end back on the A4049 at Tir-Phil.
The original northern end of the A469 was in Ystrad Mynach. Later in the 1920s, that road was extended north to meet the A4050 near Pengam railway station and then, in 1935, the entire A4050 was renumbered as part of a northern extension of the A469, giving that road the spur that survives to this day. Bargoed has since been bypassed.

Life and career
They were born on June 4, 1896, in Manhattan, the son of Lucretia Bishop "Eva" Roberts and Oliver Eaton Cromwell. Their sister Louise Cromwell Brooks was the first wife of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and the third wife of the famous stage and film actor Lionel Atwill. They grew up in Philadelphia after their widowed mother married Edward T. Stotesbury in 1912 and moved there.
Cromwell's first wife was automotive company heiress Delphine Ione Dodge, the only daughter of Horace Dodge of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, one of the two co-founders of the Dodge Motor Company. They were married from June 17, 1920 until their divorce on September 28, 1928, and had one daughter, Christine Cromwell, in 1922.
On February 13, 1935, Cromwell married Doris Duke. Both supported Franklin Roosevelt and their New Deal.

The Ellsworth Street Bridge is a highway bridge that crosses the Willamette River in Albany, Oregon, United States. Built in 1925, the two-lane structure carries U.S. Route 20 eastbound traffic, with the adjacent Lyon Street Bridge carrying westbound traffic. The -long steel-truss bridge was designed by Conde McCullough and opened in 1926.
History
In 1887, a bridge was built across the Willamette River at Albany for the Corvallis and Eastern Railroad followed by the Steel Bridge built in 1893 just down river. The state of Oregon began building a new bridge across the river at the city in 1925 to carry vehicular traffic. Designed by state highway department bridge designer Conde McCullough, it was constructed by the Union Bridge Company based in Portland, Oregon. The steel truss structure was completed in 1926.
When the bridge opened, the Albany-Corvallis Highway was completed. At the time the structure was named the Albany Bridge. In 1973, the neighboring Lyon Street Bridge was completed to the east to expand capacity to a total of four lanes between the two bridges. Ellsworth Street Bridge was refurbished in 1971 and 2002. As of 2004, the bridge handled an average of 9,850 cars per day.
Details
Classified as functionally obsolete with a 53.8% sufficiency rating, the two-lane bridge carries eastbound traffic of U.S. Route 20 south into downtown Albany at milepost 10.44. The bridge's main span consists of four steel thru-trusses in the Parker style, each in length. Ellsworth Street Bridge is a total of long and wide with a vertical clearance of . The seven concrete approaches are of a girder design. The green colored bridge also has ornate concrete railings and entrance pylons. Ellsworth Street Bridge was of the few steel truss bridges completed while McCullough was in charge of bridge design in Oregon, and it is one of the few multi-span steel truss bridges remaining in the state.

The Bragg House is a historic house in rural Ouachita County, Arkansas. It is a two-story Greek Revival house located about west of Camden, the county seat, on United States Route 278 (formerly designated Arkansas Highway 4). The house is basically rectangular in plan, with a hip roof. Its main entrance is sheltered by a two-story temple-style portico, with four columns topped with Doric capitals, and a turned-baluster railing on the second floor. Peter Newport Bragg began construction of the house in 1842, but did not complete it until 1850. The house was built out of virgin lumber sawn on Bragg's sawmill by their slaves; it remains in the hands of Bragg's descendants.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

Lisa Suter Taylor (1933–1991) was an American artist and museum director. Taylor served as the first director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design from 1969 to 1987, and was the first woman director of a museum within the Smithsonian Institution.
Early life and education
Taylor was born in New York, the daughter of architect Theo von Bergen-Maier and painter Martina Weincerl. They trained as a painter, ceramist, and calligrapher, studying at the Corcoran School of Art, Georgetown University, and Johns Hopkins University. They were awarded honorary doctorates from the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.
Career
From 1958 to 1962 Taylor was a staff member of the President's Fine Arts Commission. From 1962 to 1966 they were the membership director at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 1966 they started at the Smithsonian as a Program Director, where they developed a successful education program.
Cooper Hewitt - Smithsonian Design Museum
The collection of the Cooper Union Museum came under the wing of the Smithsonian in 1967. Shortly after, the Andrew Carnegie Mansion was donated to the Smithsonian in 1968 to become the new home for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design. After its transfer to the Smithsonian, the museum was renamed the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, and Taylor was appointed director in 1969. This made them the first ever woman to lead a Smithsonian museum.
In the following 4 years, Taylor and their staff raised over $6 million for the renovation of the mansion and formation of the museum. After being closed since 1963, the museum opened to the public in 1976. The first exhibition was MAN transFORMS, with Hans Hollein and nine designers.
While at the museum, Taylor oversaw the development of a Master's degree in Decorative Arts and developed both adult and young-person education programs. In their time as director, they presented 175 exhibitions in the museum, and enjoyed mixing more serious exhibits with humorous ones.
In 1979, Taylor created the annual Museum Mile Festival, a one-day, free festival on New York City's Fifth Avenue where cultural institutions are open to the public.
They were awarded the Smithsonian's Exceptional Service Award in 1973.
After they retired as director in 1987, they were succeeded by Dianne Pilgrim.
Personal life
Taylor was married, with two children and three stepchildren.
In addition to a New York apartment, Taylor enjoyed spending time at their house that they built in Martha's Vineyard. A Japanese-style house designed by architect Teruo Hara. Everything in the house was made for the space, from the furniture, to the dishes, to the toilet paper racks.

The professional sabre competition at the 1900 Summer Olympics involved 27 fencers from 7 nations. It was held from 23 to 27 June at the Tuileries Garden. The event was won by Antonio Conte of Italy, with that nation also receiving second place with Italo Santelli. Austria's Milan Neralić finished third.
Background
Fencing was the only sport that had professional competitions at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904. A professional foil event was held in 1900, with épée and sabre joining in 1904. The professional events were not held again afterwards (excepting the 1906 Intercalated Games, so this was the only time that masters sabre was contested.
Competition format
The event used a three-round format: quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. Each round consisted of pool play. For the quarterfinals, the fencers were divided into 4 pools of 6 of 7 fencers each; the top four fencers in each pool advanced to the semifinals. The semifinals had the 16 men compete in 2 pools of 8, with the top 4 in each pool advancing to an 8-man final.
The actual competition format within pools is not entirely clear. The pool composition in the quarterfinals is unknown.

The last offices, or laying out, is the procedures performed, usually by a nurse, to the body of a dead person shortly after death has been confirmed. They can vary between hospitals and between cultures.
Name
The word "offices" is related to the original Latin, in which officium means "service, duty, business". Hence these are the "last duties" carried out on the body.
Aims
To prepare the deceased for the mortuary (a funeral home or morgue), respecting their cultural beliefs
To comply with legislation, in particular where the death of a patient requires the involvement of a Procurator Fiscal aka. Coroner
To minimise any risk of cross-infection to relative, health care worker or persons who may need to handle the deceased
Procedure
Often the body of the deceased is left for up to an hour as a mark of respect. The procedure then typically includes the following steps, though they can vary according to an institution's preferred practices:
Removal of jewellery unless requested otherwise by the deceased's family. If left on it must be documented in the patient's property list.
Wounds, including pressure sores, should be covered with a waterproof dressing. Tube insertion points should be padded with gauze and tape to avoid purging.
The patient is laid on his/her back with arms by their side (unless religious customs demand otherwise). Eyelids are closed.
The jaw is often supported with a pillow or cervical collar.
Dentures should be left in place, unless inappropriate.
The bladder is drained by applying pressure on the lower abdomen. Orifices are blocked only if leakage of body fluid is evident.
The body is then washed and dried, the mouth cleaned and the face shaved.
An identification bracelet is put on the ankle detailing: the name of the patient; date of birth; date and time of death; name of ward (if patient died in hospital); patient identification number.
The body is dressed in a simple garment or wrapped in a shroud. An identification label duplicating the above information is pinned to the wrap or shroud.
A stretcher drawsheet is placed under the body to enable removal to a trolley for transportation to the morgue. These trolleys may often be disguised to resemble laundry carts if transportation has to pass through areas where members of the public may be present.
Bathing the dead
Washing the body of a dead person, sometimes as part of a religious ritual, is a customary funerary practice in several cultures. It was delegated to professionals in ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, and by well-off Victorians, and is now in Western societies, but was traditionally performed by "family, friends, and neighbors."
Judaism
It is part of traditional Jewish burial rites.
During the Inquisition in Spain, bodies undergoing preparation for burial were sometimes scrutinized for signs that they had been washed, since this was seen as a marker of secret Jewish practice (crypto-Judaism).
Buddhism and Hinduism
Bathing of the dead, known as yukan, is also found in Buddhism. It is also found in Hinduism.
Islam
It is a religious practice in Islam, where the body is washed by members of the dead person's family. When possible, three washings are performed: first with water infused with plum leaves, then with water infused with camphor, and lastly with purified water.
The washing is usually performed by others of the same gender, although Islamic Hausa people permit spouses to wash each other's bodies.
Africa
Funerary bathing is performed in traditional funerals in some countries in West Africa. The ritual washing of the dead is believed to be one of the factors which resulted in the rapid spread of Ebola virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014.
In Algerian religious tradition, a Ĝassâla, or Washer of the Dead is a woman who assists with death purification rites.
Cultural references
Antigone speaks of washing the dead in accordance with the Greek custom, although they were limited to pouring water on the body of their brother Polyneikes.
The custom of bathing the dead has been depicted in a number of films. In the 1995 film Braveheart, a young William Wallace watches as women bathe the bodies of their father and brother, who were killed in battle against English troops during the 13th century. The 2009 film The White Ribbon depicts the washing of a deceased housewife in a Northern German village just before World War I. In the film A Midnight Clear (1992), set in the Battle of the Ardennes in World War II, a small group of soldiers is able to take a brief respite from the war when they procure a bath tub and heat up some water. After all have bathed, they wash the body of a comrade who was recently killed while trying to help a unit of German soldiers.
An episode of the HBO series Six Feet Under shows Nate Fisher's body being "slowly and methodically" washed by their mother and brother.

140–142 Hospital Street, sometimes known as Hospital House, is a substantial townhouse in Nantwich, Cheshire, England, located on the south side of Hospital Street (at ). The building is listed at grade II. It was built in the late 16th century by John Crewe, a tanner, whose sons Randolph and Thomas both served as the Speaker of the House of Commons. The original timber-framed, close-studded façade has been concealed by alterations during the late 17th century; these include the addition of small-paned casement windows, some of which contain old heraldic stained glass. The building was further altered and extended in the 18th century, with the addition of two Gothic-style entrances. Later occupants include the architect, Thomas Bower, and the building remains in residential use.
The present building is believed to stand on the site of the medieval Hospital of St Nicholas, which gives Hospital Street its name. Stone remains discovered in the garden have been associated with the hospital.
Hospital of St Nicholas
Historian James Hall tentatively identifies the existing building as standing on the site of the medieval Hospital of St Nicholas, which was established at the end of Hospital Street and gives the street its name. Founded by William Malbank, the first baron of Nantwich, in 1083–84, the hospice was a religious house which accommodated sick or infirm travellers and gave alms to the poor. It was dissolved in 1548; on 11 November of the following year, Edward VI granted "a House and manse formerly called the Chapel of St. Nicholas", together with associated land and property, to Sir Thomas Bromley of Nantwich, a justice of the King's Bench. By 1569, Bromley had sold it to Richard Wright. The original site of the Wright's Almshouses, built in 1638, was on part of the former hospice's land.
History of present building
The present building dates originally from the late 16th century, and was built by John Crewe (c. 1524–98), who is said to have been a tanner. The Crewes claimed descent from the de Crewe family, who owned the manor of Crewe (now Crewe Green) in the 13th century. John Crewe married Alice Mainwaring, daughter of Hugh or Humphrey Mainwaring, and the house was probably built after their marriage. The Mainwarings were one of the prominent gentry families in Nantwich, having owned land there since the 14th century, and were also involved in the salt-making industry. John Crewe was the landlord of the property on Waterlode where the 1583 fire started "through negligence of undiscreet persons brewing", which destroyed much of the centre of the town, but spared the end of Hospital Street. Two of the couple's sons achieved national prominence in the legal profession and parliament. Randolph Crewe became a judge, member of parliament (MP), parliamentary Speaker and, briefly, Lord Chief Justice; they made a fortune from a successful practice in chancery and other London courts, and built the Jacobean mansion, Crewe Hall, in nearby Crewe Green. Thomas Crewe also became a lawyer, MP and Speaker. John Crewe died in 1598 and was buried in Nantwich. A carved marble memorial in St Mary's Church described them as "Johannes Crewe ex antiquâ familiâ de Crewe oriundus, vir pius" ("John Crewe descended from the ancient family of Crewe, a pious man"); it was removed in 1729.
In the 1650s, "ye Hospitall howse" or "St Nicholas Hospitall" was owned by the Wilbraham family; it was leased in 1655 to William Jackson, a tanner. Jackson kept a tannery at the end of Hospital Street, possibly on the site now known as the "old tanyard"; this might have earlier been John Crewe's tannery. Subsequent inhabitants of the house include the Goldsmith family (early 18th century) and the Caldwell family, later of Linley Hall, Talke, Staffordshire (late 18th century). The last of the Caldwell family is identified by Hall as the Scot described in Joseph Priestley's journal: "In my congregation there was (outside of the house in which I was boarded) hardly more than one family in which I could spend a leisure hour with much satisfaction, and that was Mr. James Caldwell's, a Scotchman." In 1883, the occupier was the architect, Thomas Bower, who built offices at the east end of the house. In the course of these alterations, stone remains were discovered in the garden, which Bower identified as being part of a Norman doorway, perhaps part of the original Hospital of St Nicholas.
Description
140–142 Hospital Street is one of a group of houses dating from the 15th and 16th centuries at the end of Hospital Street, which include Churche's Mansion, number 116 and The Rookery (number 125). It is a timber-framed building with a predominantly rendered finish under a tiled roof. It has three bays to the main front face and two storeys with attics. An 18th-century extension on the east (left) side is in painted brick and faces onto a passageway; the rear of the building also dates from the 18th century. The upper storey overhangs to form a continuous jetty along the front façade. A common urban design, this was an unusual layout for a Nantwich mansion; other examples had a central hall with flanking wings as, for example, at Churche's Mansion, a few houses up the street. The Hospital Street face was originally close studded, that is, decorated with closely spaced upright timbers, as at the Crown Hotel on the High Street. The timbering was covered in the late 17th century, giving the building its current 17th-century appearance.
The main entrance, in the Gothic style, dates from the late 18th century. Stone steps lead to the door, which is headed by an ogee-arched moulding, with paired quatrefoil decorations above surmounted by a cornice. Nikolaus Pevsner describes the entrance as "pretty". This entrance is flanked by 17th-century casement windows; there are three casement windows on the first floor and three gabled dormer windows with casements, dating from the late 17th century. All the casements have a lattice of small panes, headed by a circular pattern. The three first-floor casements contain old stained glass displaying the Crewe and Mainwaring coats of arms. The main section of the house also has four sash windows to the ground floor, dating from the late 18th century.
The 18th-century east bay has another Gothic-style entrance on the east face, which duplicates the main entrance. It has sash windows to the ground and first floors, on both the Hospital Street and east faces.

For the television series of the same name, see The Silver Theatre.
Silver Theater (sometimes written as Silver Theatre) was a radio dramatic anthology series in the United States. Originating in Hollywood, California, it was carried on CBS and on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. First broadcast October 3, 1937, its last broadcast was August 17, 1947.
Format
Drama
Originally, Silver Theater featured movie stars, primarily in original dramas and less often in adaptations of movies. Comedies were presented occasionally. In a reversal of the customary trend, some original dramas from Silver Theater were purchased for use in movies. In 1947, when the program was broadcast as a summer replacement series, radio stars—rather than those from movies—were used as leads.
Variety
In 1941, the Summer Silver Theater was a variety program, with Ed Sullivan as host and Will Bradley as bandleader. A guest star featured each week.
Personnel
By its nature, Hollywood Star Playhouse had no regular cast. Different movie stars of the era were featured, as indicated in the sampling of episodes and stars listed below. One continuing presence was that of the host, who was referred to as the "director" on the air. Conrad Nagel was the initial host. John Loder replaced them in the early 1940s. Announcers over the program's lifetime were John Conte, Dick Joy, Henry Charles, Roger Krupp, Jack Bailey, and Harry Bartell. Felix Mills directed the orchestra.
Selected episodes
Sponsor and promotions
The sponsor, International Silver Company, launched the program by inviting couples married 25 years or more to the CBS studio for the initial broadcast on October 3, 1937.
International Silver apparently chose well in selecting Silver Theater as a vehicle for advertising. The company's satisfaction with increased sales was such that CBS ran a four-page advertisement in the March 1, 1940, issue of Broadcasting magazine touting the advertising's effectiveness. The ad quoted comments from International Silver: "After thirteen weeks on CBS: 'We find we can paint a more alluring picture ... by radio than with the printed page.' ... After three years on CBS: '[S]ubstantial increase in sales for every year we have been on the air.'" As the ad continued, it noted that Silver Theater had become more popular over those three years and that "as the popularity of the program has increased, sales of 1847 Rogers Bros. have increased."
Concurrently, the International Silver Company advertised their 1847 Rogers Bros. silverware with advertisements in LIFE magazine including product endorsements by Hollywood actores. Many also performed in the Silver Theater, including Judy Garland, Carole Lombard, Ginger Rogers, Rosalind Russell, and Loretta Young. Another brand of the company, International Sterling, also promoted the Silver Theater in LIFE magazine advertisements.
CBS also produced a brochure "showing success of the Silver Theatre."
Adaptations
International Silver of Canada, counterpart of Silver Theater'''s sponsor, had its own version of the program (Summer Silver Theatre) on the CBC in 1941. The program "bore little resemblance to its American counterpart" and lasted for only 10 episodes.

Phenyltropanes (PTs) were originally developed to reduce cocaine addiction and dependency. In general these compounds act as inhibitors of the plasmalemmal monoamine reuptake transporters. Although RTI holds a strong position in this field, they are not the only researchers that have prepared these analogues. This research has spanned beyond the last couple decades, and has picked up its pace in recent times, creating numerous phenyltropanes as research into cocaine analogues garners interest to treat addiction.
Uses
Addiction
The phenyltropane compounds were initially discovered by R. Clarke et al. during research to try and dissociate the stimulant properties of cocaine from its abuse and dependence liability. The first simple phenyltropanes to be made (WIN 35065-2 and WIN 34,428) were shown to be active in behavioral assays only for the ββ-isomers. The activity of the corresponding αβ-isomers was disappointing.
It was later shown that WIN 35065-2 and WIN 34,428 are mostly dopamine selective reuptake inhibitors with some residual actions at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (SERT). The neurotransmitter dopamine is a key candidate for explanation of reinforcing actions drugs. It's unclear to which extent NET is involved in the reinforcing actions of cocaine (an SNDRI). Animal studies show evidence that inhibiting the SERT might reduce cocaine intake.
Animal studies on monkeys and rats have tried to assess the self-administration propensity of phenyltropane analogs alongside cocaine. Frequently the analogs are administered prior to the start of a session to see if they can suppress cocaine lever responding. Most of the analogs behave in ways that might be considered typical for a DRI. In particular, they tend to stimulate locomotor activity, and cause nonselective reductions in cocaine intake relative to food. At the dose that can reduce cocaine intake, most of the analogs require a high DAT occupancy. This would mean that the agonists would need to be behaviorally active at the dose that can bring about reductions in cocaine craving. Most of the analogs will readily substitute for cocaine, although most do not elicit as many lever responses per session because of pharmacokinetic factors. Since these agonists function as reinforcers, there is an obvious concern surrounding their abuse liability.
Nevertheless, a slow onset, long-duration agonist seems like a reasonable approach. Phenyltropanes are widely used in animal studies of drug addiction as they share the stimulant properties and reinforcing effects of cocaine, but with higher potency, less non-specific binding which avoids the cardiotoxicity associated with cocaine.
RTI-336 is an interesting example of a phenyltropane that is being explored in the context of a treatment for cocaine addiction. RTI-336 is a DRI and thus specifically targets the DAT which is responsible for the addictive properties of cocaine. Although there may be a role for NET inhibition and acetylcholinergic actions, clearly it is DA which is the critical neurotransmitter. Dopamine is a biological precursor to noradrenaline. DA is made from tyrosine, which is a non-essential amino acid given that it can be made from phenylalanine.
The more greatly attested habit creating methamphetamine is more serotonergic than the lesser reinforcing amphetamine. Most modern research suggests that 5-HT is negatively correlated with the addiction forming potential of psychostimulants, this is not saying that SRI properties cannot be considered beneficial. In fact, the above was proven by Rothman for releasing agents under the PAL-287 program of related molecules. What was somewhat interesting is that although the reason for the lack of reinforcement of RTI-112 is now well established, closely related RTI-111 was able to behave in ways that might be typical for a nonselective SNDRI such as cocaine. The role of the NET is not completely deleterious. In a recent paper by Rothman on transporter substrates, they establish that for releasers that are amphetamine-like, discrimination stimulus is more accurately dictated by NE release than DA release. This argument does not mitigate a case against the importance of DA, but is suggestive that catecholamine in general is important. the exact ratio being 50:50 in the case of methylphenidate.
Desipramine and atomoxetine are not reliably self-administered though, whereas most selective DRIs are. SSRIs are not self-administered either. Hence, it should be borne in mind that these neurotransmitters are unlikely to be involved in the addiction forming properties of cocaine and related stimulants. Nevertheless, they are still behaviorally active and will contribute to the effects that such drugs elicit in their users.
Promiscuity among transporters is worth bearing in mind. Monoamine transporters can transport neurotransmitters other than their "native" neurotransmitter. As an example, in the prefrontal cortex where DATs are lower in number, DA is transported mostly by the NET instead. Hence, selective NRIs such as atomoxetine are able to increase the concentration of supracellular (synaptic) DA in this brain region via NET blockade.
Weeding out SERT and NET affinity is desirable in the context that these molecular targets are less relevant to the goals of the treatment program, which is to reduce cocaine intake. It can be clearly seen that RTI-336 has fewer metabolically labile sites than cocaine, and therefore has a longer duration span.
Binding ligands
These compounds are primarily used in scientific research, as their high binding affinity for monoamine transporters, and the wide range of radiolabelled phenyltropane compounds available with different binding specificities makes them very useful for mapping the distribution of the various monoamine transporters in the brain.
Other uses
Some phenyltropane derivatives have also been researched for medical use in the treatment of conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, depression, and their strong appetite suppressant effects makes them promising candidates for facilitating weight loss in the treatment of obesity.
Structure-activity relationships
Transporter selectivity
Compounds are known with a pronounced selectivity for each MAT – dopamine, noradrenaline and the serotonin transporter.
Phenyltropane-based "SNDRI's" are another possibility.
Isomers study
All of the tables and graphs shown beneath is from an article published by FIC, et al. 2004. In summary the following observations can be made: Troparil, WIN35428 and RTI-32 are insufficiently potent. This observation is mainly based on the fact that at 100 mg/kg both troparil and WIN35428 produce convulsions. The twist-boat isomers are insufficiently potent in all cases. The trans isomers (alpha,beta) are too weak and might actually be dangerous and cause death. RTI-55, while highly potent, still causes death at a dose of 100 mg/kg. It is advised to consider RTI-229. RTI-31 is the most potent isomers for the DAT and was "safe" (on a relative scale) even in the event of overdose at 100 mg/kg. RTI-51 also looks like a "good" compound, although its synthesis is slightly more difficult than for RTI-31. RTI-51 is less selective for the DAT than RTI-31 and has appreciable SERT affinity also.

The Paimpol–Bréhat tidal farm is an 8 MW tidal turbine demonstration farm off Île-de-Bréhat near Paimpol, France. It is developed by Électricité de France (EdF). The project was initiated in 2004 and work began in 2008.
The tidal farm will consist of four turbines, 2 MW each. Turbines are assembled by DCNS and installed by OpenHydro. The first turbine was installed in August 2011. According to EdF, when completed it will be the world's largest tidal array and the world's first grid-connected tidal energy farm.
The two turbines were retrieved from the seabed in 2017 for replacement of components that threatened the turbine's resistance to corrosion. These turbines were never redeployed and the project was subsequently cancelled by EdF in 2018.

Park Central Mall was the first shopping mall in Phoenix, Arizona. It is located in Encanto Village, on Central Avenue and Osborn Road.
Today it exists as a mixed-use, business park primarily occupied by regional administrative offices for non-profit hospital operator Dignity Health (formerly known as Catholic Healthcare West), and regional offices for UnitedHealth Group. The property currently is known simply as Park Central.
History
Park Central Shopping City, as it originally was known, was first envisioned by Ralph Burgbacher and their older brother, A.J. Burgbacher. The two men purchased the Central Avenue Dairy in the 1950s. At the time Phoenix was a much smaller city, and the mall's location, north of the state capitol was an early edge city, which in time came to be known as "Uptown" Phoenix. Other developers criticized the brothers, believing a development out in the "dairy farm" area was futile, but development proceeded and the open-air mall was completed in 1957. The mall was designed by a collaboration of architects in the Mid-Century Modern style. Welton Becket designed the Goldwater's building and Ralph Haver and John Schotanus Jr. designing other parts of the mall. The mall was built by Kitchell-Phillips Contractors Inc. When the mall opened, the primary anchors were a twin-level Goldwater's which predated the initial opening of the mall. It opened November 8, 1956. There were also a twin-level Diamond's, and a J.J. Newberry five and dime store. Ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the mall and its first 31 stores were held on April 1, 1957.Goldwater's and Diamond's soon closed their older, downtown stores favoring their new midtown location in the mall. When JCPenney closed its downtown location in the mid-1960s, the downtown area never would regain its status as the retail draw it once was. The original Phoenix-based Playboy club was across Central Ave. to the East; it closed in the mid-1980s.
As Phoenix quickly grew, the area around Park Central Mall saw an increasing number of mid-rise and high-rise office buildings built along Central Avenue, and eventually became known as the central business district. Part of this mid-1960s transition included the new addition of a twin level JCPenney store at the mall, and a covered parking deck on the northeast end of the property built in 1967, to help combat the hot summertime temperatures. The new structures were designed by Al Beadle.
Unable to compete with newer enclosed and air-conditioned shopping malls, Park Central, still an open-air facility, had lost most of its major retailers by the very late 1980s. The first major anchor to leave was Robinson's, which had purchased and converted the Goldwater's store years earlier, closing the location down just before the end of the decade. The second major anchor to leave was JCPenney, closing just at the start of the 1990s. Finally the last anchor, Dillard's, which had purchased and converted Diamond's a few years prior, became a discount Dillard's Clearance Center and remained open in that format until the mid-1990s.
Current
Conversion of the property began shortly after the last anchor closed and most vacant retail space was converted to lease-able office space. Much of the original architectural design was covered up or removed and the exterior of the mall was given a Postmodern appearance. The Diamond's space at the west / back end of the old mall became the Arizona regional offices for Catholic Healthcare West (later known as Dignity Health after it became independent of the Catholic Church), parent company of St. Joseph's Hospital located on an adjacent property. Banner Health Systems soon moved some administrative functions into what was Goldwater's, and finally the old JCPenney space became offices for UnitedHealth Group. The remaining smaller retail spaces began to fill with nearly a dozen small restaurants mostly located at the east/front end of the old mall (including Starbucks Coffee, Jamba Juice and Qdoba Mexican Grill). Other smaller businesses, such as a flower shop, a shoe repair shop, a vitamin/health supplements store, computer training company Training a la Carte, the primary customer care call center for cable service provider Cable One and a branch location of Wells Fargo Financial, occupy the remaining storefronts. A Hampton Inn hotel location sits on the southwest corner of the property adjacent to the Dignity Health offices.
Nearly all the mall's original buildings still stand, and most have only cosmetic changes.
In October 2017, the city of Phoenix proposed that Amazon.com locate its "second headquarters", expected to employ 50,000 people, at the Park Central location.

72 Things Younger Than John McCain is a book by American blogger Joe Quint. The book lists items from popular culture that were invented after John McCain's birth in 1936, including nachos, Social Security, chocolate chip cookies, duct tape and ZIP codes. 72 Things Younger Than John McCain also includes people who are younger than McCain, even though the reader might believe them to be older. Quint used the book to show how the age of a candidate was more relevant to their success as President of the United States than gender or race.

Muhammad ibn al-Qa'im () also known as Muhammad Dhakirat was an Abbasid prince, son of Abbasid caliph Al-Qa'im. They were designated as heir apparent by their father in the mid-eleventh century CE but died before their father.
Biography
Muhammad was the son of Abbasid caliph Al-Qa'im who reigned from 1031 to 1075 and the grandson of caliph al-Qadir. Their full name was Muhammad ibn Abu Ja'far al-Qa'im ibn Ahmad al-Qadir. They were known in Baghdad as Muhammad Dhakirat.
In 1030, their grandfather, al-Qadir named their son Abu Ja'far al-Qa'im, as their heir, a decision taken completely independently of the Buyīd emirs. During the first half of al-Qa'im's long reign, hardly a day passed in the capital without turmoil. Frequently the city was left without a ruler; the Buyīd emir was often forced to flee the capital. While the Seljuk influence grew, Dawud Chaghri Beg married their daughter, Arslan Khatun Khadija, to al-Qa'im in 1056.
Their father, al-Qa'im nominated them heir apparent in mid eleventh century however they died during their father's reign and their father then nominated their son, Abdallāh (future Al-Muqtadi) as next Heir-apparent. In 1075 al-Muqtadi succeeded their grandfather, when al-Qa'im died at the age of 73–74. Al-Muqtadi was born to Muhammad Dhakirat, the son of caliph al-Qa'im, and an Armenian slave girl called Urjuwuan.

The Singu Min Bell (), also known as the Maha Gandha Bell, is a large bell located at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar (Burma). It was donated in 1779 by King Singu, the fourth king of Konbaung Dynasty. The official Pali name of the bell is Maha Gandha, which means "Great Sound".
Description
The bell weighs about 23-25 tons and measures high, wide at the mouth and thick. There are twelve lines of inscription on the bell. The inscriptions describe King Singu, who came to the throne on 9 June 1776, who ruled over the country of 16 provinces, cast and donated the bell to the Shwedagon Pagoda on 17 January 1779.
History
The bell was cast between 1776 and 1779. In 1825, British attempted to take it from the pagoda during first Anglo-Burmese War. However, the ship that carried the bell to Calcutta sank in Yangon River together with the bell. After several unsuccessful attempts to salvage the bell, British finally gave up. Then, a group of Burmese people successfully raised the bell from the riverbed and restored to its original position at the pagoda.
Current status
The bell is housed in a pavilion located on the northwest side of the pagoda's middle terrace.

Matthew Akers (born November 19, 1975) is an American film director, producer, cinematographer, and photographer.  They are best known for the critically acclaimed documentary Marina Abramović: The Artist is Present, (2012) for which they won a Peabody and Emmy Award. They recently directed two primetime ABC television specials for David Blaine, Real or Magic (2013) and Beyond Magic (2016), which featured Blaine performing magic for various celebrities and public figures.
Early life and education
Akers was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. They studied fine art and sculpture at the School of Visual Arts.
Career
Akers has shot and produced over a dozen documentary television series, including the 10-part series Carrier (2008) during which they lived on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf for six months, and Circus, (2010) in which they spent a year on the road traveling with the Big Apple Circus.
In 2010 they were approached by their friend and producer, Jeff Dupre, to make a film about the performance artist Marina Abramović. They were skeptical at first, but Abramovic gave them the keys to their apartment and full access to document their life in the months leading up to their performance at The Museum of Modern Art. 'The show became an art world and pop culture phenomenon, as hundreds of people lined up for hours for a chance to sit with Abramović – the 'grandmother of performance art.'
The film itself is a "mesmerizing cinematic journey inside the world of a radical performance artist who draws no distinction between life and art." The New Yorker called the film an "epic in its own right," alluding to the fact that Akers logged some 1400 hours of footage, before editing it down to 105 minutes. The film offers an inside look at the exhaustive process involved in successfully producing an artistic performance of such a grand scale, and attempts to bring Marina's art to the masses.

Lethbridge-West is an Alberta provincial electoral district, covering the western half of the city of Lethbridge, including all of West Lethbridge.
Under the Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution of 2004, 13 Street forms most of the dividing line between Lethbridge-East and Lethbridge West. Scenic Drive and 16 Avenue South form a small part of the boundary. Clockwise from Lethbridge-East, the constituency is bounded at the city limits by Little Bow, by Livingstone-Macleod and then again by Little Bow.
The current Member of the Legislative Assembly for this district is New Democrat Shannon Phillips.
History
The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary redistribution from the old electoral district of Lethbridge when it was split in half.
The 2010 boundary redistribution made some minor revisions to equalize the population between West and East. North of St. Edward Blvd the boundary was pushed west from 13 Street to Stafford Drive.
Boundary history
Representation history
The electoral district was created in 1971 from the old Lethbridge district when it was split in half. Prior to 1971 the city returned candidates from a number of different banners. The first representative returned in the election held that year was Social Credit candidate Richard Gruenwald who won the district with well over half of the popular vote.
Gruenwald would run for a second term in the 1975 election and would be defeated finishing a distant second place behind Progressive Conservative candidate John Gogo who took almost 60% of the popular vote. Gogo would win their next two terms in 1979 and 1982 with increasing majorities achieving almost 70% of the popular vote.
Gogo would lose significant popularity upon re-election to their fourth term in 1986. They would fall from 70% the previous election to under half. They would hold their seat for a final term in 1989 when they took just over 45% of the popular vote. In their last term in office Premier Don Getty appointed Gogo as Minister of Advanced education They held that until 1992. Gogo retired from dissolution of the Assembly in 1993.
The 1993 election saw a hotly contested race between Progressive Conservative candidate Clint Dunford and Liberal candidate Michael Dietrich. Dunford won by a razor thin margin of just over 100 votes to hold the seat for their party and taking just over 41% of the popular vote.
Dunford was re-elected in 1997 winning a slightly higher plurality. After the election they were appointed to the provincial cabinet by Premier Ralph Klein as Minister of Advanced Education and Career Development. In 1999 they were shuffled to the Minister of Human Resources and Employment portfolio.
Dunford ran for their third term in 2001 increasing their plurality slightly taking 48% of the popular vote and kept their cabinet post. They ran for their fourth term in office in 2004 and fell to an all-time low holding their seat with just 39% of the popular vote. After that election they were shuffled to the Minister of Economic Development until 2006. Dunford retired from the legislature in 2008.
The fourth representative returned from the riding was Progressive Conservative candidate Greg Weadick who won their first term as MLA in 2008, and was re-elected in 2012, but was defeated in the 2015 general election by Shannon Phillips of the NDP. In 2019, Phillips held onto the riding with a reduced margin of victory over the second-place finishing UCP candidate with just 45% of the popular vote.

King's Rhapsody is a 1955 British musical film directed by Herbert Wilcox and starring Anna Neagle, Errol Flynn and Patrice Wymore. Wymore was Errol Flynn's wife at the time of filming. It was based on the successful stage musical King's Rhapsody by Ivor Novello.
Plot
Prince Richard of Laurentia is summoned from exile with their mistress Marta (Anna Neagle) in Monte Carlo, to resume Royal duties following the death of their father, the King (Finlay Currie).  They are charged to marry Princess Cristiane of Norseland (Patrice Wymore) and produce an heir to the throne. Although Richard's affections are with their mistress, they soon finds their heart warming to their new wife.

Joan Benham as Countess Astrid
Reginald Tate as King Peter
Miles Malleson as Jules
Edmund Hockridge as The Serenader
Production notes
The film was the first of what was meant to be a six-film deal over three years worth £2,500,000. The intention was that Flynn and Neagle would form a team along the lines of Neagle's pairing with Michael Wilding, starting with The White Witch of Rose Hall in Jamaica. However this was the last of the two movies they made together.
Reception
The film was not a success.
Filmink said that "at times King's Rhapsody feels like an amateur theatre production, with the stars “acting” but with enthusiasm."
In Errol Flynn: The Life and Career, Thomas McNulty noted, "Shot in CinemaScope, the colorful costumes were wonderful to look at but unfortunately the actors wearing those costumes, particularly Flynn, are wooden and unconvincing," and went on to write that they found the film "merely dull," and that "The plot is a disaster disguised as a screenplay"; while Allmovie considered the film "one of the few Neagle/Wilcox failures."
Release
The film underperformed at the box office. A condensed 45-minute version, taken from the film's soundtrack, was broadcast as a BBC Radio play in September 1955.

Maurotoxin (abbreviated MTX) is a peptide toxin from the venom of the Tunisian chactoid scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus, from which it was first isolated and from which the chemical gets its name. It acts by blocking several types of voltage-gated potassium channel.
Chemistry
Maurotoxin is a peptide of 34 amino acids (sequence VSCTGSKDCYAPCRKQTGCPNAKCINKSCKCYGC) cross-linked by four disulfide bridges (Cys3-Cys24, Cys9-Cys29, Cys13-Cys19, Cys31-Cys34), with an atypical pattern of organization compared with other scorpion toxins; this unusual pairing of cysteine residues may be mediated by the presence of adjacent prolines. The peptide contains an alpha helix linked by two disulfide bridges to a two-stranded antiparallel beta sheet.
Target
Scorpion toxins constitute the largest group of potassium (K+) channel blockers and are useful pharmacological probes to investigate ion channels and their functions.
Maurotoxin (MTX) blocks various K+ -channels:
Apamin-sensitive small conductance Ca2+ - activated K+ channels (SK)
Intermediate conductance Ca2+ - activated K+ channels (IK)
Several types of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 and shaker B)
The structural and pharmacological features of MTX suggest that MTX belongs to a new class of natural K+ channel blockers structurally intermediate between the Na+ (60–70 residues and four disulfide bridges) and K+ channel scorpion toxin families (less than 40 residues and three disulfide bridges).
The intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (IK) channel is present in peripheral tissues, including secretory epithelia and blood cells. An important physiological role of the IK channel is to help maintain large electrical gradients for the sustained transport of ions such as Ca2+ that controls T lymphocyte (T cell) proliferation. Thus IK blockers could be potential immunosuppressants for the treatment of autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis).
Mode of action
MTX occludes the pore region of various potassium channels (Kv1.2, IKCa1, Kv1.3) by establishing strong interactions between its lysine-23 residue and the glycine-tyrosine-glycine-aspartate (GYGD) motif of the channel. MTX thus blocks the channels by binding in the external vestibule of the pore to block the ion conduction pathway. Although Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 have a very similar pore structure, they display different pharmacological sensitivity to MTX.

Walter Kämpf (12 September 1920 – 2 November 1943) was an Austrian anti-Nazi activist. They became a resistance member when they were still at school in Vienna. Following their conscription in 1939 they were also a soldier. They were subsequently suspected of "spying" and convicted by a military court. Their death sentence was carried out using the guillotine that had been installed at the Vienna Regional Court complex, soon after the incorporation of Austria into an expanding German state.
Life
Walter Kämpf was born in Vienna. They attended the Döblinger Gymnasium (secondary school) on the north side of the city, but left early in order to progress to the Höhere Bundeslehr- und Versuchsanstalt für chemische Industrie, a prestigious vocational college which had been established during the early years of the twentieth century to train students for graduate-level careers in the important chemicals industry. They were excluded from the college in 1936, however, for "kommunistischer Betätigung" ("Communist activity"). The circumstances under which they were readmitted are unclear, but they graduated after completion of their "fourth year" in 1938/39, receiving exceptionally high marks.
In March 1938 the country was invaded and became part of Nazi Germany, which had been a one-party dictatorship since 1933. Walter Kämpf and their friends reacted by creating the Young Communist "Soldiers' Soviet" ("Soldatenrat") group. The term "Soldatenrat" is also sometimes translated into English-language sources as Soldiers' Council: it references the workers' and soldiers' soviets/councils which emerged across much of central Europe, including Austria and Germany, in the chaotic immediate aftermath of the First World War. Other group members included Elfriede Hartmann, Friedrich Mastny and Franz Reingruber. Activities principally involved producing illegal news sheets and leaflets. As a result of Kämpf's training in chemistry the group were also able to produce so-called "Brandplättchen" (loosely, "fire plates"), which might be used for future sabotage actions.
War returned in September 1939 and Walter Kämpf was conscripted into the wartime army.
Bizarrely, Nazi Germany was now unexpectedly on the same side as the Soviet Union which invaded Poland from the east sixteen days after the German invasion from the west (which according to mainstream anglophone historiography triggered the war). For many of those, such as Kämpf, who retained an active commitment to the illegal Communist Party, it was hardly possible to oppose unhesitatingly the alliances entered into by Stalin and the comrades in Moscow. Kämpf's attitude to the Stalin-Hitler alliance is unclear, but any unease would have been resolved when the Germans changed sides and, in June 1941, invaded the Soviet Union. A month later, in July 1941, Walter Kämpf switched to work as a paramedic, assigned to a military hospital for Luftwaffe casualties. Their role was still essentially, a military one, however: by the time of their arrest they would have reached the rank of "Luftwaffenobergefreiter" (loosely, "flight sergeant").
It is evident that conscription in 1939 did not mark an end to Walter Kämpf's secret double-life as a resistance activist. Membership of the army indeed presented new opportunities to infiltrate ideas into the Hitler Youth. Some fellow conscripts received anti-Nazi letters from the activists, while communist news-sheets such as "Soldatenrat" and "Die Rote Jugend" were left in quiet corners where they might be casually found and, it was hoped, read by young soldiers trying to make sense of rapidly developing events. After the outbreak of war, Kämpf teamed up with a fellow conscript called Friedrich Mastny. Mastny had also been a leader in the Vienna Young Communists. Now they worked together on the production of anti-government news sheets.
The authorities became increasingly concerned by the impact on morale of anti-government activists in the army, and the resistance group to which Kämpf and Mastny belonged was infiltrated by Gestapo informers. Later Kämpf would smuggle out warnings to those comrades who remained at liberty, identifying four "snitches" named Herta, Olga, Gretl and Sonja, who lived in north-west Vienna in a house owned by a man called Glaser or Gläser along the Selzergasse. One of the girls had become the girlfriend of Glaser or Gläser, and between them they betrayed many members of the resistance group to the authorities, along with various friends and contacts. Walter Kämpf was arrested on 27 April 1942: Friedrich Mastny just over a couple of weeks later on 13 May 1942. They were able to smuggle out (at least) one "report" to comrades from prison, in which they warned their comrades against Gestapo spies whom they identified and who had infiltrated the group. They were also able to report the interrogation to which they had been subjected, some of it under torture. On 17 February 1943 the special People's Court delivered its verdict. In the main trial they had taken the opportunity to declare that they had seen it as their duty to help put an end to the war against the Soviet Union as soon as possible. They had become convinced that Germany would never succeed in a war against Bolshevism. The defendant was an uncommonly dangerous enemy of the state. For the present and future welfare and safety of the people and of the state, their eradication was imperative.
Walter Kämpf was executed on 2 November 1943 at the Vienna Regional Court complex. Their friend and comrade Friedrich Mastny was executed later the same day.

Rumblefish Inc. is a music licensing company specializing in all forms of synchronization licensing with a focus on 'micro-licensing' and online network monetization such as with YouTube's Content ID. It covers over 1.8 million pieces of music and it licenses over 20,000 soundtracks on more than nine million social videos.
History
In 2010 Rumblefish partnered with YouTube to allow YouTube video creators to pay a small fee to legally license music for their videos.
In late 2011 Rumblefish entered into a partnership with CD Baby to license the music from CD Baby's independent artists for movies, TV shows, ads, video games, apps, and YouTube.
In early 2013 Rumblefish acquired Catalogik, a music rights administration software as a service (SaaS).
Controversy
Rumblefish has generated controversy by sending copyright takedown notices to YouTube alleging copyright violations in videos' soundtracks, even when the user has written rights to the usage of a particular song or recording, or when users are musicians posting their own videos of songs they wrote and performed themselves and to which they own all copyright.
In early 2012 Rumblefish falsely claimed ownership of birdsong heard in the background of a YouTube video, resulting in the video being taken down. When the owner of the video objected, Rumblefish reiterated its claim. Rumblefish CEO Paul Anthony later admitted that mistakes were made, and stated that Rumblefish would be improving its process.
In 2015, Rumblefish falsely filed a copyright claim on the public-domain song America the Beautiful, as performed by the United States Navy Band (whose performances are all likewise public-domain).

271 North Avenue (also known as the Schiff Building, Pershing Square, the Kaufman or K Building) is a 13-story art-deco office tower located in the downtown section of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York.
Overview
The brick, limestone and terra-cotta structure was designed by the architectural firm Schwartz & Gross and constructed by Harry Schiff & Sons. It was completed in 1930 at a cost of $1 million.
The building is built-up following the principles which guided early skyscraper design.
Overall, the building's use of massing is derived from the sections used in all classic columnar orders, consisting of a base, shaft and capital.
The 3-story retail storefront space serves as the base, upon which are 10 stories, serving as the shaft, and, above this, is the cornice, representing the capital. The lower floors include commercial storefronts on the first story with a round-arched arcade on the second and third. The upper facade is designed with flat topped windows with minor detailing in the brick surrounds. In 1936 an additional floor was added to the building. The cornice is of terra cotta and includes medallions and dentils.
This was the tallest building in Westchester County when it was built in the 1920s. It was originally called the "Pershing Square Building", derived from its location on Pershing Square at the intersection of North Avenue and Huguenot Street. The building is located on the site of the former "Besley's Tavern", a Revolutionary War-era establishment where town meetings were held in 1773–1776. George Washington had once lodged at the tavern on a trip through New Rochelle. The building was developed, built and owned by Harry Schiff & Son, prominent New York developers who erected and owned numerous buildings in New Rochelle and New York City. It was later renamed "Kaufman" by a later landlord, the owner of Kaufman Studios in Queens, New York.
Paul Terry established their animation company Terrytoons here in 1934. The firm created such well known characters as Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle, in the building until 1949 when it relocated to a nearby downtown location.
WVOX-AM 1460 maintained studios and offices here for decades.

Bhabhar is a town and a former princely state in Gujarat, India.
History
Bhabhar, was held by Koli Thakor, has a history closely like that of the Kankrej estates. Originally part of the Tervada district, it was taken in farm by thakor Hathiji of Kankrej, who in 1742, took advantage of the prevailing anarchy, to establish the village of Bhabhar, and by degrees to gain possession of the deserted lands of Tervada. During British period, under two nominal chiefs, the village lands were parcelled among a large body of cadets, bhayad.
Bhabhar entered into agreements with the British Government in 1820. It was under Palanpur Agency of Bombay Presidency, which in 1925 became the Banas Kantha Agency. After Independence of India in 1947, Bombay Presidency was reorganized in Bombay State. When Gujarat state was formed in 1960 from Bombay State, it fell under Banaskantha district of Gujarat.

SPC John Crawford is an American Iraq War veteran and writer originally from Palatka, Florida known for their bestselling memoir The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell, about their tour in Iraq. In the early 2000s, Crawford, already an Army veteran, had enlisted in the Army National Guard to help pay for their college tuition. Because they already held an associate degree from Tallahassee Community College, they were assigned the rank of Specialist.
In 2002, John Crawford was recently married and close to earning a degree in Anthropology from Florida State University. In 2003, their unit was deployed to Kuwait and later Iraq during the early stages of the Iraq War.
"I was planning to enroll in a master's program at FSU," they say. "Instead I took a vacation to Iraq."
Crawford describes their experiences as having created a "new level of accountability," and remarked that when they told their fellow soldiers they were writing a memoir about their experience, all of them "wanted to know if I was writing a 'super liberal' book."
Crawford later plans to travel to Afghanistan to write an account of the current War on Terror in the country from a civilian perspective.
Crawford has made appearances on National Public Radio and The Daily Show.

Blades formerly known as Blades of Hades, are an Australian hip hop group from Newcastle. Since forming in the late 1990s they have released four albums, Blades of Hades, This Installment, Shadow Art in 2008, and The Leak in 2013. The group took its name from Greek mythology, where Hades was the Gatekeeper of the Underworld. Their hardcore style lyrics and dark production are reminiscent of many British Hip Hop 'Britcore' acts, such II Tone Committee, Hijack and Killa Instinct. The group have developed a strong following overseas, having performed at many festivals in Europe, including Germany's Mass Hysteria in Hamburg. In 2008, they were the first independent Australian hip hop act to perform at the Glastonbury Festival in the United Kingdom.
History
Newcastle brothers Kid Lyrical and Wizardry met Likewyze onstage, when the duo began rhyming over a performance of a funk band Likewyze was playing guitar in. At the time Likewyze was studying audio at music school and offered to record the duo, along with Scotty B and DJ Skoob, the three time NSW DMC champion. This resulted in their debut album, the self-titled, independently released Blades of Hades.
By 2005, Jane Tyrrell had joined the Sydney hip hop group The Herd full-time. The group counter-acted the line-up change and shortened their name to just 'Blades' in 2006. The same year, they released their second album This Installment, which was distributed by Obese Records. The album featured Newcastle DJ Mark N on cuts and production for the track 'Blast Opposition', which they also released a video clip for. Blades appeared on Oriel Guthre's documentary Skip Hop: Volume One in 2006. They were interviewed and also contributed to the project's soundtrack. Shadow Art was released in 2008, followed by their free to download mix tape Two Thousand And Nine the following year. Another free to download mix tape was released in 2010.
In June 2010, Blades signed to Difrnt Music which acts include Cog and Regular John. Blades are the record label's first hip hop group. Lui from Unda K9 negotiated and got the crew signed whilst they were working as Label Manager for David Edwards (former manager for INXS, Michael Hutchence and the Executive Producer of Rock Star: INXS) who is the MD Difrnt Music. Lui marketed the first single "Where The Fire's At" and assisted briefly in the group's future endeavours to be released from Difrnt to be signed to Warners, with Adam Marshall taking the role as the crew's official manager.

The bare area of the liver (nonperitoneal area) is a large triangular area on the diaphragmatic surface of the liver. It is the only part of the liver with no peritoneal covering, although it is still covered by Glisson's capsule. It is attached directly to the diaphragm by loose connective tissue. The bare area of the liver is relevant to the portacaval anastomosis, encloses the right extraperitoneal subphrenic space, and can be a site of spread of infection from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity
Structure
The bare area of the liver is found on the posterosuperior surface of the right lobe of the liver. This lies close to the thoracic diaphragm. It is the only part of the liver that has no peritoneal covering. It lies between the two layers of the coronary ligament, as well as the right triangular ligament. The coronary ligament represents reflections of the visceral peritoneum covering the liver onto the diaphragm.
The bare area of the liver is attached to the thoracic diaphragm by loose connective tissue. It touches the bottom surface of the diaphragm. It is also not covered in capsule.
Clinical significance
The bare area of the liver is clinically important because of the portacaval anastomosis. It is a site where infection can spread from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity. It encloses the right extraperitoneal subphrenic space.
History
The bare area of the liver may also be known as the nonperitoneal area.

The Veritas RS was a Veritas sports car based on the BMW 328 that also raced in Formula One. It raced in five World Championship Grands Prix; the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the 1952 Belgian Grand Prix, the 1952 German Grand Prix, the 1953 Belgian Grand Prix, and the 1953 German Grand Prix. Its best result in Formula One racing was a 7th-place finish at the 1952 German Grand Prix, being driven by Fritz Riess.
History
In 1949, work was completed on the racing sports car based on the BMW 328, with the engine increased to (on some specimens the maximum power even reached ). However, 1949 was also the year in which the Veritas Komet coupé, a road version of the RS, was launched. And furthermore, again in 1949, Veritas was transferred again, this time to Muggensturm, where it abandoned the 2-litre BMW of the 328 to instead use a engine (to be precise, 1998 cm³), but made by Heinkel. There were 200 orders for motorized Veritas, but poor financial management of the company resulted in 1950, at the end of series car production.

Verbena, also known as Summerfield, is an unincorporated community in southeastern Chilton County, Alabama, United States. Named for the indigenous flower, Verbena developed into a popular resort location for the more affluent citizenry of Montgomery, the state's capital, during the yellow fever outbreaks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many stately homes, some of which have undergone recent renovation and restoration, line the streets of the town as a reminder of this historic past.
The town was built beside the railroad currently owned by CSX Transportation. In its heyday, Verbena had two hotels, a bank, a post office, and a general store. Many of those buildings are gone or boarded up today, but the Verbena United Methodist Church still stands on County Road 59 near the town's center.
According to the U.S. Census in 1890, Verbena showed a population of 756, making it the largest community in Chilton County at that time.
Modern era
Today, Verbena is a quiet community on the outskirts of Clanton. The town is located on U.S. Route 31 four miles south of Interstate 65 exit 205. It has a USPS Post Office (ZIP Code 36091), several small specialty stores, and numerous churches. The local school is Verbena High School (K5-12), home of the Red Devils. The community is served by the Chilton County Sheriff's Department and Verbena Volunteer Fire and Rescue.
Other communities in the area that are typically considered to be a part of Verbena are Cooper (pronounced "Coopers" by many locals), Enterprise (not to be confused with the city of Enterprise in South Alabama), and Midway.
The town is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Upon their return, they started to run into problems with the government regarding the education system. The government had started arresting and censoring many of the people who went against government ideas regarding the education system, and this caused Prah to decide to start a campaign to free their colleagues. With the government soon looking to arrest him, Prah left for South Africa, where they had contact with the Pan-African society. In South Africa, they became the director of sociology at the University of the Western Cape (UWC).

Their most noted papers include Challenges to the Promotion of Indigenous Languages in South Africa, Reflections on the Annals of Neocolonialism, and Realities of African Governance and the Relevance of Higher Education; Problems and Prospects. Their papers regard what Africa has gone through over the years in its transformation. They also address what struggles the continent has faced and may face in the future.
Along with writing papers, they have had many speeches and books about that address similar topics as their papers but in more depth. Their books include Beyond the Colour Line (1997), Between Distinction and Extinction (1998), and Africa in Transformation Vol. 1 (2000). They have written about 30 books for their organization CASAS.
Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society
In 1997 Prah founded the Centre for Advanced Studies of African Studies (CASAS), the main focus of which is the economic, social, cultural, and political aspects that have led to the current development of Africa. CASAS focuses on African cultural issues and how they relate to Africa's development, which is not commonly found in other African research groups.
CASAS employs experts in the field of African Society and the majority of their hires come from African institutions. CASAS is registered as a non-profit organization in South Africa and seeks most of its funding from donations.

"The Sound of Them Voice" is the 149th episode of the syndicated American science fiction television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 25th episode of the sixth season. It was first broadcast the week of June 8, 1998.
Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on the Starfleet-run space station Deep Space Nine. In this episode, the Deep Space Nine crew, aboard the starship Defiant, answers a call for help from a stranded Starfleet officer; meanwhile, back at the station, the bartender Quark attempts to distract security chief Odo so that they can conduct a smuggling operation. Debra Wilson guest stars.
The episode's premiere received Nielsen ratings of 4.1 points corresponding to about 4.05 million viewers.
Plot
While traveling home from an escort mission, the crew of the Defiant reception a distress call from Captain Lisa Cusak (voiced by Debra Wilson), a Starfleet officer stranded on an alien world by herself, after their ship, the Olympia, has been destroyed. After establishing communication with her, they discover that the planet they are stranded has a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which will eventually kill them without regular doses of "triox" medication, and their supplies of it are running low. Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig) tells them to cut their dose so that they will survive the six days that it will take the Defiant to reach the planet. Captain Cusak asks that they keep a constant conversation going with them to keep their alert and to make them feel less isolated.
As they converse with her, the Defiant crew becomes closer to Captain Cusak. Captain Sisko (Avery Brooks) confides in them that they are uncomfortable having their girlfriend Kasidy Yates (Penny Johnson Jerald) aboard the Defiant; Cusak advises them against mixing their professional and personal life. They help Bashir and chief engineer Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) realize they have been letting the stress of their work and the ongoing war isolate them from their friends.
When Cusak's supply of triox runs low, Sisko orders power diverted from weapons to allow the Defiant to travel at a higher speed. They arrive at the planet shortly after Cusak has fallen unconscious, giving them a limited amount of time to find them After figuring out how to get their shuttlecraft past a strange energy field that surrounds the planet, the crew finds that Cusak has been dead for roughly three years. O'Brien theorizes that the energy field caused their communications to travel through time. Sisko orders them to collect Cusak's body and gives them a proper burial back on Deep Space Nine as a Starfleet officer and trusted friend.
Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) talks Odo (René Auberjonois) into planning a date with Major Kira (Nana Visitor) for their one-month anniversary. They tell budding writer Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton), who is writing a story about criminals, that while Odo is occupied they will sell rare crystals for profit. However, Odo decides to move their romantic evening to the following night, ruining Quark's plan. Taking pity on him, Odo decides to let them off this one time and has their evening with Kira when they originally planned.
Production
This episode introduced the Chaffee shuttlecraft for the Defiant, designed by Doug Drexler. It is named after the real Apollo astronaut Roger Chaffee. In the book Ships of the Line by Doug Drexler and Margret Clark, they state that naming it after Chaffee is a reminder about the dangers of space exploration.
Reception
In 2018, Vulture rated "The Sound of Them Voice" the 8th best episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. They praised how actor Debra Wilson is able to establish the character of Lisa Cusak using only voice, and how the episode builds up a series of relationships using conversation.

The Continental Blockade (), or Continental System, was the foreign policy of Napoleon Bonaparte against the British Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. As a response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect a large-scale embargo against British trade. The embargo was applied intermittently, ending on 11 April 1814 after Napoleon's first abdication. The blockade did not cause significant economic damage to the British, although British exports to the continent (as a proportion of the country's total trade) dropped from 55% to 25% between 1802 and 1806. As Napoleon realized that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, they invaded those two countries. Their forces were tied down in Spain—in which the Spanish War of Independence was occurring simultaneously—and suffered severely in, and ultimately retreated from, Russia in 1812.
The Berlin Decree forbade the import of British goods into any European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and it installed the Continental System in Europe. All connections with Britain were to be cut, even the mail. However it couldn't be enforced reliably and British merchants smuggled in many goods, and thus the Continental System proved itself an ineffective weapon of economic war. There was some damage to British trade, especially in 1808 and 1812, but British control of the oceans led to replacement trade with North and South America, as well as large scale smuggling in Europe particularly from Malta which was used by the British to sell their goods to southern Italy. The loss of Britain as a trading partner also hit the economies of France and its allies. Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon's coalition.
Background
The British government was the central force in encouraging and financing alliances against Napoleonic France. Napoleon was frustrated in their repeated attempts to defeat Britain. Attacks that involved naval power had all failed, with the systematic defeats of the combined French and Spanish navies. After the decisive defeat at Trafalgar, Napoleon made no attempt to rebuild their Navy. They turned instead to economic warfare, planning to ruin the British economy. It was thought that Britain depended completely upon trade with Europe for its prosperity, so cutting off trade with continental Europe would ruin the British economy and force it to sue for peace. A blockade was impossible because the Royal Navy controlled the seas, but if Napoleon controlled the ports of Europe, they could prevent British products from landing.
The Royal Navy imposed a naval blockade of the French and French-allied coasts, on 16 May 1806. Napoleon resorted instead to economic warfare. Britain was Europe's manufacturing and business center as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Napoleon believed it would be easy to take advantage of an embargo on trade with the European nations under their control, causing inflation and great debt to undermine the British strength. Their position was strengthened by the Fall of Berlin in October 1806, bringing swathes of Prussia under their control.
In November 1806, having recently conquered or allied with every major power on the European continent, Napoleon, in retaliation to the British Order-in-Council of 17 May 1806 blockading all ports from Brest to the Elbe, issued the Berlin Decree forbidding their allies and conquests from trading with the British. Britain responded with further Orders in Council issued on 10 January and 11 November 1807. These forbade French trade with Britain, its allies or neutrals, and instructed the Royal Navy to blockade all French and allied ports, and to prevent all shipping whether neutral or not. Napoleon responded again with the Milan Decree of 1807, declaring that all neutral shipping using British ports or paying British tariffs were to be regarded as British and seized.
Napoleon's plan to defeat Britain was to destroy its ability to trade. As an island nation, trade was its most vital lifeline. Napoleon believed that if they could isolate Britain economically, they would be able to invade the nation after its economic collapse. Napoleon decreed that all commercial ships wishing to do business in Europe must first stop at a French port in order to ensure that there could be no trade with Britain. They also ordered all European nations and French allies to stop trading with Britain, and they threatened Russia with an invasion if they did not comply as well. Their orders backfired in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in Portugal (being allied to Britain), setting off the Peninsular War. They pushed Russia too hard, both in terms of the Continental System, and in their demands for control over part of Poland. Napoleon's attempted 1812 invasion of Russia was a disaster which set the stage for their downfall.
Effects
British Empire
The System had mixed effects on British trade. The embargo encouraged British merchants to seek out new markets aggressively and to engage in smuggling with continental Europe. Napoleon's exclusively land-based customs enforcers could not stop British smugglers, especially as these operated with the connivance of Napoleon's chosen rulers of Spain, Westphalia, and other German states. British exports to the Continent fell between 25% to 55% compared to pre-1806 levels. However, trade sharply increased with the rest of the world, covering much of the decline.
Britain, by Orders in Council, prohibited other countries (that is, its trade partners) from trading with France. The British countered the Continental system by threatening to sink any ship that did not come to a British port or chose to comply with France. This double threat created a difficult time for neutral nations like the United States. In response to this prohibition, the U.S. government adopted the Embargo Act of 1807 and eventually Macon's Bill No. 2. This embargo was designed as an economic counterattack to hurt Britain, but it proved even more damaging to American merchants. Together with the issues of the impressment of foreign seamen, and British support for Indian raids in the American west, tensions led to a declaration of war by the U.S. in the War of 1812. This war, not Napoleon's blockade, sharply reduced British trade with the United States.
The British economy suffered greatly in 1810 to 1812, especially in terms of high unemployment and inflation. This led to widespread protest and violence, but the middle classes and upper classes strongly supported the government, which used the army to suppress the working class unrest, especially the Luddite movement.
France and Continental Europe
The episode seriously hurt France itself. Shipbuilding, and its trades such as rope-making, declined, as did many other industries that relied on overseas markets, such as the linen industries. With few exports and lost profits, many industries were closed down. Southern France, especially the port cities of Marseille and Bordeaux, as well as the city of La Rochelle, suffered from the reduction in trade. Moreover, the prices of staple foods rose in most of continental Europe.
Napoleon's St. Cloud Decree in July 1810 opened the southwest of France and the Spanish frontier to limited British trade, and reopened French trade to the United States. It was an admission that their blockade had hurt their own economy more than the British. It had also failed to reduce British financial support for its allies. The industrialized north and east of France, and Wallonia (the south of today's Belgium) saw significantly increased profits due to the lack of competition from British goods (particularly textiles, which were produced much more cheaply in Britain).
In Italy, the agricultural sector flourished; but the Dutch economy, predicated on trade, suffered greatly as a result of the embargo. Napoleon's economic warfare was much to the chagrin of their own brother, King Louis I of Holland.
Scandinavia and the Baltic region
Britain's first response to the Continental system was to launch a major naval attack on the weakest link in Napoleon's coalition, Denmark. Although ostensibly neutral, Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. London could not take the chance of ignoring the Danish threat. In the Second Battle of Copenhagen in August–September 1807, the Royal Navy bombarded Copenhagen, seized the Danish fleet, and assured control of the sea lanes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea for the British merchant fleet. The island of Heligoland off the west coast of Denmark was occupied in September 1807. This base made it easier for Britain to control trade to North Seaports and to facilitate smuggling. The attacks against Copenhagen and Heligoland started the Gunboat War against Denmark, which lasted until 1814.
Sweden, Britain's ally in the Third Coalition, refused to comply with French demands and was attacked by Russia in February and by Denmark/Norway in March 1808. At the same time, a French force threatened to invade southern Sweden, but the plan was stopped as the Royal Navy controlled the Danish straits. The Royal Navy set up a base outside the port of Gothenburg in 1808 to simplify operations into the Baltic Sea. The Baltic campaign was under the command of admiral James Saumarez. In November 1810 France demanded that Sweden should declare war upon the United Kingdom and stop all trade. The result was a phony war between Sweden and Britain. A second navy base was set up on the island of Hanö in the south of Sweden in 1810. These two bases were used to support convoys from Britain to Gothenburg, then through the Danish straits to Hanö. From Hanö the goods were smuggled to the many ports around the Baltic Sea. To further support the convoys, the small Danish island of Anholt was occupied in May 1809. A lighthouse on the island simplified navigation through the Danish straits.
Russia also chafed under the embargo, and in 1810 reopened trade with Britain. Russia's withdrawal from the system was a motivating factor behind Napoleon's decision to invade Russia in 1812, which proved the turning point of the war and their regime.
Portugal and Spain
Portugal openly refused to join the Continental System. In 1793, Portugal signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Britain. After the Treaty of Tilsit of July 1807, Napoleon attempted to capture the Portuguese Fleet and the House of Braganza, and to occupy the Portuguese ports. They failed, as Queen Maria I of Portugal took their fleet and transferred the Portuguese court to Brazil with a Royal Navy escort. The Portuguese population rose in revolt against the French invaders, with the help of the British Army under Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington. Napoleon intervened, and the Peninsular War began in 1808. Napoleon also forced the Spanish royal family to abdicate their throne in favor of Napoleon's brother, Joseph.

The San Sebastian Cathedral, also referred to as the Tarlac Cathedral, is a post-war, Neo-Gothic church located in Brgy. Mabini, Tarlac City, Philippines. The cathedral, which was dedicated to Saint Sebastian in 1686, is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarlac.
Parish history
The town of Tarlac was said to have been established in 1686 by priests assigned to Magalang, Pampanga. The town was managed by the Augustinians from Pampanga until in 1725, a petition was brought to the attention of the Father Provincial to separate Tarlac from its distant matrix. In 1727, the separation was fulfilled with Tarlac being declared an independent parish. In 1757, however, the parish of Tarlac was annexed back to Magalang for quite some time.
Architectural history
The first parochial building of Tarlac is attributed to Father Agustin Barriocanal in 1740. Later on, in 1872, a wood and stone church was erected by Father Baltasar Gamarra. Construction of the said structure lasted until 1875 by Father Tomas Fito and was completed by Father Fermin Sardon in 1890. The finished church was said to have been identical to the church of Concepcion. The church was completely destroyed during the war, in 1945. It was later rebuilt into the present-day church structure.

Bílá labuť (in English 'White Swan') is a department store on Na Poříčí Street in central Prague, Czech Republic. It is considered to be one of the finest examples of interwar avant-garde architecture. It is recognised by the Prague Municipality as an architecturally valuable building and is protected as a cultural real estate monument. At the time it was opened in 1939, it was the biggest and most modern department store in Central and Eastern Europe. It is currently undergoing an extensive renovation.
History
The Bílá labuť Department Store building is located on Na Poříčí Street, one of the busiest streets in the New Town area of Prague 1. The building stands on the former site of the "U Podušků" inn and brewery. Over time, these buildings became known as the White Swan Inn due to the Swan Statute on their facade.
In the 1930s the buildings were purchased by Jaroslav Brouk of Brouk a Babka. The old buildings were demolished and replaced by a functionalist department store which opened in 1939.
The new building bore the Bílá labuť name and was designed by renowned architects Josef Kittrich and Josef Hrubý. The department store has a total area of about 72,000 m³ spread over 11 floors, including 6 retail floors. It is recognized as one of Prague's most architecturally important buildings and a celebrated example of the "International Style" of functionalism. At the time of its opening, it was the largest and most modern commercial building in Central and Eastern Europe and remains well known throughout the Czech Republic as a retail icon.
Interesting features of the building included modern interior design, the first escalator in Prague, and a glass facade measuring 33 x 18 meters, consisting of 180 sheets of non-transparent, silver-gray glass with thermal- and noise-insulating properties. At the time, it was the largest glass-covered space in central Europe. There is also an eight-meter revolving neon swan on the roof – the oldest neon sign in Prague.
The building was opened on 19 March 1939 against the tragic background of the Nazi occupation of the Czech Republic, which had occurred four days previously, and the store has been continuously operating since then.
Today
In November 2017, a renovation that fully respects the original, historically protected, construction began. This includes a complete restoration of the glass facade, which had deteriorated significantly over the years.
The store remains a key retail destination in Prague, with high footfall and excellent demographics in the surrounding area. Tenants include Lidl, Kika, and a large number of other medium to smaller retail spaces.

The Kishwaukee River Conference (KRC) is an organization of six high schools in northern Illinois. These high schools are members of the Illinois High School Association.
The high schools of the Kishwaukee River Conference are located in McHenry County.
History
On November 8, 2013, it was announced that Woodstock and Woodstock North planned to leave the Fox Valley Conference by 2015 and create a new conference. After rumors that members of the Big Northern Conference's East Division might join this new conference, it was announced on November 19 that five BNC members - Burlington Central, Genoa-Kingston, Harvard, Johnsburg (which at the time was still in the Fox Valley Conference but was joining the BNC as the start of the 2014–15 school year), Marengo, and Richmond-Burton were invited to join the new conference, creating a proposed 8-team conference. The next day, it was announced that the name for this new conference will be the Kishwaukee River Conference. In February 2014, it was reported that Harvard and Genoa-Kingston had decided to remain in the BNC, while Richmond-Burton and Johnsburg remained undecided; Harvard later announced that they would, in fact, leave the BNC for the KRC, with the first season of the KRC to be during the 2016–17 school year. In June 2014, Richmond-Burton and Johnsburg both voted to officially become charter members of the KRC in 2016.
On July 19, 2017, the KRC voted 5-1 to remove Burlington Central from the conference, effective following the 2018–19 school year. Burlington Central will join the Fox Valley Conference starting in the 2019–20 school year.
In 2021, the KRC entered into a football partnership with the Interstate Eight Conference. The partnership creates two divisions for football, one consisting of the 7 smallest schools across the two conferences and one consisting of the 7 largest schools. In the 2021–22 season, the "Blue" division will include Harvard, Johnsburg, Marengo, and Richmond-Burton, while the "White" division will include Woodstock and Woodstock North.

A pinfold was a structure into which straying animals were placed until they were retrieved by their owner on payment of a fine. Other terms for the structure were penfold or pound. These names were derived from the Old English words pund (pound) and fuld (fold). In Cheshire, most of these were square or circular stone structures, although there is a circular pinfold in Henbury. There is evidence of the existence of at least 153 pinfolds in Cheshire, although, as of 2010, only eight of these remain in the current county of Cheshire. There are also the remains of four other pinfolds in the county.

William Hodder, known as Bill Hodder, was an English footballer who played in The Football League for Notts County.
Early career
Bill Hodder was born and grew up in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Bill Hodder signed for Notts Rangers in 1887. Notts Rangers were founded in 1868. Notts Rangers best Cup run occurred in the only season Hodder was there, season 1887–88. Notts County got to the Fourth Round and were defeated on 17 December 1887 away to Darwen 3–1.
1888–89 season
Bill Hodder signed for Notts County in 1888. Playing as a winger, Bill Hodder made their Notts County & League debut on 8 September 1888 at Anfield, the then home of Everton. Notts County lost to the home team 2–1. NOTE: It is assumed that Hodder had not played for County before the Everton match. There is no record of exactly when in 1888 they left Notts Rangers and signed for Notts County.
Bill Hodder, playing as a winger, scored their debut and only League goal on 15 December 1888 at Leamington Road, the then home of Blackburn Rovers. Notts County lost to the home team 5–2. Bill Hodder scored the first of Notts County' two goals.
Bill Hodder appeared in 20 of the 22 League matches played by Notts County in season 1888–89 and scored three League goals. As a winger (19 appearances ) they played in a Notts County midfield that achieved big (three–League–goals–in–a–match–or–more) wins on two occasions.
.
1889 onwards
The Magpies fielded a total of 33 different players in League matches in season 1888–89, and this is an undemanding programme of only 22 matches. Notts County' 11th-place finish, in a League of 12 clubs, ensured sweeping changes in personnel during the close season, Hodder being among the casualties. So, in September 1889 they went across town to join Nottingham Forest. Nottingham Forest were members of the Football Alliance. It is unclear whether Hodder ever played for Forest as in the same year, 1889, they signed for Kidderminster Olympic.
Kidderminster Olympic were in the Birmingham & District League. Kidderminster Olympic and Kidderminster Harriers had a tremendous rivalry and in the 1889–1890 season Olympic won the title and Harriers were runners-up. It can only be assumed that Hodder was part of the League Championship title winning team. Hodder was at Kidderminster Olympic for the start of the 1890–1891 season but for an unknown reason they left in January 1891 and signed for The Wednesday.
The Wednesday were in the Football Alliance and were having a poor season finishing bottom of the League in the Spring of 1891.
For the next two seasons, 1891-1892 and 1892–1893, Hodder played for Lincoln City. Lincoln City were not members of a League but competed for and won the Lincolnshire Senior Trophy. In 1893-1894 Lincoln City were founder members of the Football League Division 2. Hodder did not play for the first team and left in 1893.
In 1893 Hodder signed for Mansfield Town. Mansfield Town played in the Midland Counties League and this was Hodder' last club. It isn't known when they retired and what they did after their football career had finished.
Bill Hodder was living in Nottingham when they died at the age of 31 in March 1897.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance is a Phoenix, Arizona based corporation that manages health benefits under the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VAPCCC program in Regions 3, 5, and 6. On October 1, 2018, TriWest's contract for VAPCCC was expanded to cover Regions 1, 2, and 4.
History
In 1996, TriWest Healthcare Alliance was established in order to compete for a U.S. Government contract to manage civilian health care benefits under the newly established TRICARE program within the 16-state TRICARE Central Region, also known as Regions 7 and 8. In 1996, TriWest was awarded the contract for the TRICARE Central Region and began operations.
The TRICARE Central Region included the following states:
Arizona;
Colorado;
Southern Idaho;
Iowa;
Kansas;
Minnesota;
Missouri;
Montana;
Nebraska;
Nevada;
New Mexico;
North Dakota;
South Dakota;
El Paso, Texas;
Utah; and
Wyoming.
TriWest was awarded an extension to this contract, which continued until 2004.
On August 21, 2003, TriWest was awarded the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract for the TRICARE West Region. The five-year contract, valued at approximately $10 billion, expanded TriWest's service area to 21 states and 2.7 million beneficiaries with the addition of Alaska, California, Hawaii, northern Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
On July 13, 2009, TriWest was awarded the contract (also known as the "T-3 contract") to continue providing military families access to health care and manage the 21-state TRICARE West Region for the Department of Defense (DoD).
On March 16, 2012, it was announced that the T-3 West Region contract was awarded to Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group. The contract was worth $20.5 billion
On March 26, 2012, it was announced that TriWest will protest the Department of Defense award of the contract to UnitedHealth. David McIntyre (President and CEO of the TriWest Healthcare Alliance) cited the long history of performance and legal problems with the subsidiary which would handle the T-3 contract.
On July 2, 2012, it was announced that TriWest lost its appeal to keep the West Region contract.
In September 2011, TriWest paid $10 million to settle a Justice Department lawsuit after whistle-blowers claimed TriWest "systematically defrauded" Tricare by billing the government higher rates than they had negotiated with health care providers. The lawsuit also said TriWest sent 3,000 claims through one location a day to intentionally bypass checks to avoid late-payment fees and that it paid claims for ineligible beneficiaries.
In September 2017, VA Inspector General Michael Missal issued a memorandum that listed four major “errors” that had resulted in excess payments to TriWest. These were: Duplicate Errors–Payments for medical claims that have been paid more than once; Other Health Insurance8 (OHI) Errors–Payments that were not adjusted for the amount OHI was responsible to pay the provider; Pass-Through Errors–Payments to reimburse the TPA that were more than the TPA paid the provider and; Rate Errors–Payments that did not use the appropriate Medicare or contract adjusted rate. Missal stated in their memorandum that duplicate payments alone racked up almost $40 million in overpayments to TriWest

Renenūtet (also transliterated Ernūtet, Renen-wetet, Renenet) was a goddess of nourishment and the harvest in the ancient Egyptian religion. The importance of the harvest caused people to make many offerings to Renenutet during harvest time.
Initially, their cult was centered in Terenuthis. Renenutet was depicted as a cobra or as a woman with the head of a cobra.
The verbs "to fondle, to nurse, or rear" help explain the name Renenutet. This goddess was a "nurse" who took care of the pharaoh from birth to death.
They were the female counterpart of Shai, "destiny", who represented the positive destiny of the child. Renenutet was called Thermouthis or Hermouthis in Greek. They embodied the fertility of the fields and was the protector of the royal office and power.
Sometimes, as the goddess of nourishment, Renenutet was seen as having a husband, Sobek. They were represented as the Nile River, the annual flooding of which deposited the fertile silt that enabled abundant harvests. The temple of Medinet Madi is dedicated to both Sobek and Renenutet. It is a small and decorated building in the Faiyum.
More usually, Renenutet was seen as the mother of Nehebkau who occasionally was also represented as a snake. When considered the mother of Nehebkau, Renenutet was seen as having a husband, Geb, who represented the earth.
They were the mother of the god Nepri.
Later, as a snake goddess worshiped over the whole of Lower Egypt, Renenutet was increasingly associated with Wadjet, Lower Egypt's powerful protector and another snake goddess represented as a cobra. Eventually Renenutet was identified as an alternate form of Wadjet, whose gaze was said to slaughter enemies. Wadjet was the cobra shown on the crown of the pharaohs.

Ferar Cluj () was a football club from Kolozsvár/Cluj that played both in the Hungarian and the Romanian Championship.
History
Founded in 1880 as Kolozsvári Atlétikai Club, the football section was founded in 1904 and the team first entered the Hungarian second league in 1907–1908 season. The team participated in the Eastern District of the second Hungarian league. After being runner-up three times in 1907–1908, 1908-1909 and 1911–12, they finally became district champions in the 1913–14 season, even though the season was discontinued due to beginning of World War I.
After the World War I, the city of Kolozsvár/Cluj became part of Romania, and from this time it participated in the Romanian league system. The club played in the Romanian regional championship until 1934 when it was promoted to Divizia B. It spent 2 seasons there until its 1938 relegation.
During World War II, the club played in the Hungarian National Championship and finished 3rd in the 1943–44 season. Some players used were Márky – Vass, Pall – Balint, Reinhardt, Z. Szaniszló – Fábián I, Ș. Kovács IV, L. Bonyhádi, Fülöp, and Incze II. In 1945, Ferar changed its name to Ferar KMSE, having in its midst a number of valuable players including Márky, Szoboszlay, Vass, Demeter, Z. Szaniszló, Fülöp, I. Petschovsky, Mészáros, Kovács V, Ș. Kovács IV, Pall, Reinhardt, Fábián I, L. Bonyhádi, and Blejan.
At the first postbelic season, 1946–47, under the name of Ferar, a number of players were added: Boldizsár, Farmati, Börzsei, Fuzer, Váczi, and Fernbach-Ferenczi.
In 1948, the club merged with CFR Cluj and disappeared from all records.

The 1954 Pacific hurricane season featured below-average activity, with eleven tropical storms identified. The season officially started on May 15 and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. The majority of the year's storm remained offshore and caused little to no adverse impact on land. However, a tropical storm in October brought flooding rain to Mexico and Guatemala that left five people dead and thousands homeless. An unknown disease in the storm's wake killed a further 35 people.
The relative lack of activity is a byproduct of limited monitoring tools at the time. In 1954, Pacific hurricanes were only able to be identified by ship reports (either post-trip logs or in situ transmissions) and coastal observations. No more than eight coastal cities reported regular observations. Additionally, only two cities, Empalme, Sonora, and Mazatlán, Sinaloa, launched radiosondes—a key factor in detecting tropical cyclones at the time—further limiting detection capabilities.
Systems
Tropical Storm One
On June 17, an area of low pressure was identified on surface weather maps just off the coast of Guatemala. The following day, the system was classified as a tropical storm approximately 210 mi (340 km) southwest of Guatemala City. Tracking generally northwest, the system acquired maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). On June 20–21, the storm moved parallel to the Mexican coastline before turning north on June 22. It was last noted offshore on this day, approximately 50 mi (85 km) south of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán.
Tropical Storm Two
Tropical Storm Two existed from July 10 to July 16.
Hurricane Three
This hurricane made landfall in the Baja California Peninsula.
Remnant moisture from this system led to rainfall over Arizona and California, with accumulations reaching in the latter.
Hurricane Four
Hurricane Four existed from July 25 to August 1.
Tropical Storm Five
Tropical Storm Five existed from September 2 to September 9.
Tropical Storm Six
Tropical Storm Six existed from September 5 to September 9.
Tropical Storm Seven
Tropical Storm Seven existed from September 15 to September 21.
Tropical Storm Eight
Tropical Storm Eight existed from September 21 to September 27.
Hurricane Nine
Hurricane Nine existed from September 27 to October 1.
Tropical Storm Ten
Tropical Storm Ten existed from October 12 to October 14. Surface weather maps indicate the system had a central pressure of at most 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg) on October 13.
Heavy rains from the storm affected much of Mexico, impacting areas as far north as Tampico. Flooding along the Pánuco River rendered 160 people homeless; electrical service and water supplies were disrupted. The towns of Panuco and Revenadero were largely destroyed; thousands of acres of crops were submerged and livestock loss was severe. Five people died due to flooding in coastal towns near Tampico. An unidentified diseased in the storm's wake claimed 35 lives. Aid workers traveled along the swollen Pánuco River to distribute supplies, including food and snake bite serum. Severe flooding also plagued Guatemala, with thousands rendered homeless.
Hurricane Eleven
Hurricane Eleven existed from October 26 to November 1.

Wilson's warbler (Cardellina pusilla) is a small New World warbler. It is greenish above and yellow below, with rounded wings and a long, slim tail. The male has a black crown patch; depending on the subspecies, that mark is reduced or absent in the female. It breeds across Canada and south through the western United States, and winters from Mexico south through much of Central America. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.
Taxonomy
Wilson's warbler was formally described in 1811 by the ornithologist Alexander Wilson under the binomial name Muscicapa pusilla. The type locality is southern New Jersey. The species was moved to the genus Wilsonia by the naturalist and ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838. Zoologist Thomas Nuttall moved it to Sylvania in 1840, and by 1845, many authors included it in Myiodioctes. In 1899, the American Ornithological Union returned the species to Wilsonia. The species is currently assigned to the genus Cardellina. The genus name Cardellina is a diminutive of the Italian dialect Cardella, a name for the European goldfinch, and the specific epithet pusilla means "very small".
There are three recognized subspecies:
C. p. pusilla was described by Alexander Wilson in 1811.
C. p. pileolata was described by German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1811.
C. p. chryseola was described by Robert Ridgway in 1902.
The chryseola subspecies, which nests in northern coastal California to southwestern coastal Canada, has a distinctive orange-tinged yellow forehead. The population of the subspecies has declined sharply in the 21st century because it migrates preferentially to the southern end of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, where luxury resort and residential developments have replaced the bird's habitat.
Description
Wilson's warbler is a small passerine, ranging from in length, with a wingspan of and a mass of . It has a plain green-brown back and yellow underparts. The male has a small black cap. Males of the western race C. p. chryseola are greener above and brighter than males of the eastern, nominate race. Individuals from Alaska and the west-central portion of the species' range average slightly larger than those found in eastern and Pacific coastal populations. Its song is a chattering series of loud descending notes. The call is a flat "chuff".
The Wilson's warbler resembles the yellow warbler: the latter is readily distinguished by its different shape, yellow wing markings, and yellow tail spots.
Distribution and habitat
The breeding habitat is fairly open woodland with undergrowth or shrubs and thickets in moist areas with streams, ponds, bogs, and wet clearings.
Wilson's warbler breeds in northern Canada and the western US; it winters in overgrown clearings and coffee plantations, forest edges, deciduous forests, tropical evergreens, pine-oak forests, mangroves, thorn-scrub, riparian gallery forests, brushy fields, and mixed forests . At all seasons, it prefers secondary growth, riparian habitats, lakes, montane and boreal forests with overgrown clearcuts. It is a very rare vagrant to Western Europe.
Behavior and ecology
Breeding
Nesting generally begins in early March in west coast populations, and extends into August in the northern range. The female does the majority of the nest building. The cup nest is typically constructed of vegetation and lined with grasses and hair. It is often sunken into moss or sedges at the base of shrubs. The clutch varies from 2 to 7 eggs, which are creamy or off-white with fine reddish spots. The young are altricial. The montane populations generally have a higher clutch size and nest success rate than those on the coast. The eggs hatch at 11–15 days and the young fledge at 8–13 days; adults care for them for several weeks. Some montane populations are polygamous (one male breeds with multiple females). Wilson's warbler is a frequent host for the brown-headed cowbird.
Feeding
Wilson's warbler is an insectivore, feeding primarily on insects gleaned from leaves and twigs, or caught by flycatching. Some of these insects include beetles, bees, or caterpillars. The Wilson's warbler is an active forager, moving rapidly through shrubs, on the ground, and sometimes in taller trees during the winter. Feeding birds often twitch their tails or flick their wings nervously. The observed feeding rate of the male Wilson's warbler was not significantly different between males with or without mates.
It also eats a few berries.

Miraitowa () is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity () is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The events were held in Tokyo, Japan, in 2021. The checkered design on both mascots was inspired by the ichimatsu moyo pattern of the Tokyo 2020 official logo, while Someity's pink design was inspired by cherry blossoms. Both fictional characters have various superpowers, such as teleportation.
Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competitive process that took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, which then selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs from the batch to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for and , and Someity is named after someiyoshino (ソメイヨシノ), a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also echoes the English phrase "so mighty". The mascots helped financing the Tokyo Games through merchandising and licensing deals.
History
Selection and naming process
In late 2017 and early 2018, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee held a competition to determine the design of the 2020 mascots. A total of 2,042 design submissions were accepted between 1 August and 14 August 2017. The entries were then subjected to a series of format and design examinations led by media specialists and the Organising Committee's Mascot Selection Panel to determine whether they "would appeal to elementary school-aged children" and whether they "amply reflected the spirit of the Tokyo 2020 Games Vision".
By mid-October 2017, this process reduced the pool to a shortlist of three sets of mascot candidates, which were unveiled on 7 December 2017. Each set included two mascots: one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games. Between 11 December 2017 and 22 February 2018, an election was conducted across 16,769 Japanese elementary schools to choose the winning entry, with each participating elementary school class allocated one vote. In total, 205,755 elementary school classes participated in the election, which was about 75% of elementary schools in Japan.
The chosen mascots were announced without names on 28 February 2018. The winning entry was candidate pair A, created by Ryo Taniguchi. The Mascot Selection Panel held a vote on a shortlist of proposed names on 28 May 2018, and names with the most votes were subjected to a trademark verification process before they became official. The names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, were announced when the mascots made their formal debut at a press event on 22 July 2018.
Characteristics
Miraitowa, the Olympic mascot, is a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by the Games' official logo, which uses a similar checkered pattern called ichimatsu moyo that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867. It is intended to embody "both old tradition and new innovation". The character has a "strong sense of justice" and is described as "very athletic". It has the ability to teleport anywhere instantly. Miraitowa's name is a combination of the Japanese words and . According to the Tokyo 2020 organizers, the name "was chosen to promote a future full of eternal hope in the hearts of people all over the world".
Someity, the Paralympic mascot, is a figure with pink-checkered patterns inspired by cherry blossoms and also the Games' official logo. The character is described as "usually calm" but can become "very powerful when needed". The character can fly using its checkered cape and send telepathic messages using its cherry blossom-shaped antennae. It can also "talk to stones and the wind" and move objects by looking at them. Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom, and it is also intended to refer to the English phrase "so mighty".
Although the two mascots have conflicting personalities, they nonetheless have a strong friendship and respect for each other. According to their fictional backgrounds, Miraitowa and Someity "live in the digital world", and through the Internet, they can transport themselves between the digital world and the real world. According to Sadashige Aoki, an advertising theory professor at Hosei University, the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of "creating personalized characters out of nature — mountains, rivers, animals and plants", as well as a "tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul".
Artist
The mascots were designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, who lives in the Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan. Taniguchi was persuaded by their father, who is also an illustrator, to study art at Cabrillo College in California. They have illustrated English-language textbooks for Japanese children.
Taniguchi discovered the Tokyo 2020 mascot competition on Facebook in February 2017 and came up with the idea of creating a character whose head resembled a samurai war helmet with the ichimatsu moyo pattern of the official Tokyo 2020 logo. After making a rough sketch, Taniguchi reworked the design after the competition's official application requirements were announced in May 2017. In designing the mascots, Taniguchi focused on the mascots' eyes to make their proposal stand out.
Taniguchi was uninvolved in the naming of the mascots, though they did attend a screening at which various naming proposals were introduced. As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred intellectual property rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, they will not receive any royalty payments from mascot-related licensing.
Media
Merchandising
The mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games. An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million () in revenue from licensing and merchandising. The organizers of Tokyo 2020 had been criticized for its budget management. According to Reuters, a 2016 study found that overall expenses for the Olympics could be "four times the initial estimate made in the bid process". Tokyo 2020 must transfer intellectual property rights to the mascots to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over.
From late July to early September 2018, a "Mascot House" was located on the first floor of the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots. On 11 July 2019, the Tokyo 2020 organizers unveiled new merchandise, some of it featuring the mascots. merchandise can be purchased either online or through authorized vendors throughout Japan.
Plush dolls of Miraitowa and Someity were attached to the bouquets given to Olympic and Paralympic medalists at Tokyo 2020, with their "armor" in the color of the athlete's medal, as part of their design by the Nippon Flower Council.
Robotics
On 22 July 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Summer Olympics announced that robotic automatons of Miraitowa and Someity, among other robots, were expected to be included during the Games. According to the Los Angeles Times, the robots are "programmed to show facial expressions as they wave at and shake hands with athletes and fans". The Tokyo 2020 organizing committee plans to use the mascots primarily to promote the Games and greet visitors and athletes, attempting to increase engagement with children. The robots were also featured as part of a "1 Year to Go" press event on 22 July 2019 at an Olympic venue in Tokyo. The robots were included as part of another press event on 18 November 2019 at a Japanese elementary school. The robots' eyes can change to display hearts, along with other emotions, and their multiple joints and arms can be remotely controlled. Cameras allow the robots to recognize and respond to facial expressions. The robots were developed in collaboration with Toyota.
Animation
On 22 July 2019, the official Japanese Twitter account of Tokyo 2020 posted an animated short depicting Miraitowa participating in all the sports to be contested at the Games. On 25 August 2019, the same Twitter account posted a similar animated video featuring Someity participating in the Paralympic Games.
Reception
The public reaction to the mascot selection was "generally positive", according to an article published on Forbes''' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein. Adelstein described the mascots as "cute", though they commented that "there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles". Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially. Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the Pokémon and Digimon franchises. An article by Agence France-Presse described the social media reaction to the mascot selection on as "mixed". Some users commented that the mascots were "very Japanese and very cute", while others commented that the mascots should have been "more round" or "more huggable". Other commentators said that the selected design "appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options".
Dan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website Deadspin that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics, citing statements from the BBC, which wrote that the 2020 mascots "have a tough act to follow", and The Japan Times, which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi "leaves Japan in a bind". James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website SB Nation, wrote that there is "nothing functionally wrong" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead. Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision. On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese pedagogy expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults. Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a "a very Japanese anime-like quality", describing them as "brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics".
In an article published in The New York Times'' on 27 July 2021, Mike Ives and Hikari Hida commented that, despite the typical importance of mascots in Japanese advertising, the mascots have had a "subdued" presence at the Tokyo Olympics, commenting that "the Japanese public is not swooning over them either, according to fans and experts who study the country's mascot industry". Ives and Hida described a common complaint being that the names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, are difficult to remember. The article quoted a mother named Yuki Fuka, who commented, "Within the whirlwind of all the Olympic controversy, I think the mascots were forgotten somewhere along the way [...] The Games have just started and their existence is already an afterthought." According to Jillian Rae Suter, a professor of informatics at Shizuoka University, "They're not hated, design-wise. They seem to be functional. They seem to be doing a good job [...] But there doesn't seem to be a lot of passion for them." Because Miraitowa and Someity did not appear during the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, a social media user named Suekichiii tweeted a popular picture depicting them watching the ceremony from home.

Richard Oblitey Commey (born 10 March 1987) is a Ghanaian professional boxer who held the IBF lightweight title in 2019. They previously held multiple regional lightweight titles including; the Ghanaian title in 2011; the ABU title in 2013; and the Commonwealth title from 2014 to 2015.
Professional career
On 9 September 2016, Commey fought for a world title for the first time in their career, against undefeated Robert Easter Jr. Both fighters had a strong start in the first four rounds. Commey managed to drop Easter Jr. in the eighth round, but it wouldn't be enough for the judges, two of them scoring the fight 115–112 and 114–113 in favor of Easter Jr., while the third judge scored the fight 114–113 for Commey, handing Easter Jr. the split-decision win.
After losing to Robert Easter Jr. for the vacant IBF lightweight title in 2016, Commey defeated Isa Chaniev in 2019 to capture the IBF title in their second attempt.
In their next fight, Commey made their first title defence, against former champion Ray Beltrán. The title however, was on the line for Beltran, since they failed to make the required weight limit for the fight. Commey dropped Beltrán four times during the fight, the last knockdown being the decisive one, since it prompted referee Eddie Hernandez Sr to stop the fight.
Next up, Commey squared off against undefeated 22-year old prospect Teófimo López on 14 December 2019, who was ranked #1 lightweight by the IBF. During the middle of the second round, both fighters tried to connect on a right hand, but López was the one who got to their target first, catching Commey with a vicious right hand which sent them down on the floor. Commey managed to beat the count, however, López immediately went in attack mode, forcing the referee to stop the fight.
On 13 February 2021, Commey rebounded from their defeat against López with a sixth-round knockout victory against Jackson Marinez.
On 11 December 2021, Commey faced recently deposed former champion Vasiliy Lomachenko from Ukraine in an almost one-sided fight. Lomachenko dominated the fight from round one to round twelve. In round 7 Commey was knocked down and visibly shaken, causing Lomachenko to tell Commey's corner to stop the fight because of the obvious damages done to the Ghanaian fighter. After some ringside verification at the start of round 8, Commey continued, and Lomachenko won nearly all the remaining rounds. Lomachenko defeated Commey in a unanimous decision.

LeFleur's Bluff State Park is a public recreation area located on the banks of the Pearl River off Interstate 55 within the city limits of Jackson, Mississippi. The state park is home to a lake, a 9-hole golf course, and the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science.
History
The park is named for the trading post established on the banks of the Pearl River in the late 18th century by Louis LeFleur, a French Canadian trader. The village of LeFleur's Bluff eventually grew to become the city of Jackson.
The area which is now LeFleur's Bluff State Park was once part of the Choctaw Nation. Under pressure from the United States government, the Choctaw Native Americans agreed to removal from their lands east of the Mississippi River, under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830. Although many Choctaws then moved to present-day Oklahoma, a significant number chose to stay in Mississippi.
In 1821, the Mississippi Legislature, meeting in the then-capital of Natchez, sent Thomas Hinds, James Patton, and William Lattimore to look for a location on which to establish a more centrally located state capital. After surveying areas north and east of what is now Jackson, they proceeded southwest along the Pearl River until they reached LeFleur's Bluff in today's Hinds County. Their report to the General Assembly stated that this location had beautiful and healthful surroundings, good water, abundant timber, navigable waters, and proximity to the Natchez Trace trading route. On November 28, 1821, the state assembly authorized the location to become the permanent seat of the government of the state of Mississippi.
Activities and amenities
LeFleur's Bluff State Park is open for year-round recreation including hiking, boating and fishing. The Pearl River and Mayes Lake are open to fishing and boating. Common game fish include catfish, bass, bream, and crappie. A nine-hole golf course is open to the public. There are two nine-hole disc golf courses in the park. One is along the Pearl River and the other is on the shores of Mayes Lake. There are 28 campsites at the park open to tent or RV camping and 10 tent camping sites.
Trails
Since the park is surrounded by the city of Jackson, the hiking trails are all under :
Museums
The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science features aquariums, habitat exhibits, and nature trails featuring the flora and fauna of Mississippi. The museum houses the state's systematic collections, containing more than a million specimens of fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, invertebrates, plants, and fossils. Twenty-one outdoor nature exhibits managed by the museum are within the park. The native plant garden features swamp azalea, smooth phlox, mountain laurel, bell flower, sweet shrubs and spiderwort. The prairie garden plot uses minimal amounts of pesticides and fertilizers to recreate a patch of prairie featuring prairie and purple coneflower, goldenrod, gayfeather, thimbleweed and New England aster. A woodland pond is a reminder of the days when the park was a farm. It provides a habitat for frogs and other amphibians. In 2010, the Mississippi Children's Museum was completed within the state park. The upland ridge section of the park is a wooded area that hosts a disc golf course. It is a habitat for a mixture of woodland trees and was formerly farmland. Fifty to sixty million years ago what is now LeFleur's Bluff State Park was covered by an inland sea. Fossils from this era can be found on the parks bluffs.

The Soviet Athletics Championships () was an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Soviet Athletics Federation, which served as the Soviet national championship for the sport.
The early history of event traces back to two events organised by a Moscow-based skiing club: this was first held in 1920 for men only. Following the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, the next two editions in 1923 and 1924 increased in size and were held as an All-Union sports festival. A marked increase came in 1928 when 1281 athletes competed, drawing from five Union Republics, 12 regions of the Russian SDSSR and 11 foreign delegations. The event was held consistently every year from 1943 onwards. The athletics competition was incorporated into the quadrennial Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR during the latter event's lifespan from 1956 to 1991 (with the exception of 1986).
The event programme typically was close to that featured in the Olympic Games athletics competition, though the marathon, road racewalking, and combined track and field events were usually held at separate championships. It was common for there to be both an individual Soviet championship and a national athletics championship for clubs.
The last Soviet Athletics Championships was hosted in Kiev in 1991 and it ceased thereafter due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A final shared championships was held in 1992 between the Commonwealth of Independent States, after which point the newly independent nations hosted their own national championship events.

Salem is a small Welsh village in Ceredigion, located between the Afon Stewi and Nant Seilo rivers. The closest village is Penrhyn-coch.
The Salem Independent Church was built in 1864, in a similar style to the older church at Capel Bangor.
In 1998, a hoard of Roman coins was discovered within the village by metal detector, following a routine pipe excavation by Welsh Water. The 48 coins featured a range of 3rd century emperors, and were displayed in the Ceredigion Museum in Aberystwyth. The hoard is believed to date from the 290s, as a single coin of Carausius (ruled 287–293) was found at the site.

The Ukit people is a tribe found in Sarawak, Malaysia. They are a small minority people who until recently were nomads in the rain forests of Borneo. Some were settled at Rumah Ukit on the upper reaches of the Batang Balui or Balui River. Most of the Ukits are found in the Upper Rajom and Tatau rivers, Baleh, Sarawak. The Ukit people were also regarded as a sub-group of the purported Klemantan people.
The Ukit's population is small in numbers and suffer potential extinction due to many of the tribesmen being killed a long time ago. Heavy losses in war to stronger Dayak tribes in Borneo (Iban, Kayan and others) resulted them being chased out of their homelands (believed to be the Saribas, Kalaka and Krian areas). Intermarriage with other tribes is also another factor for their decreasing population. Today, the Ukit population is estimated to be only about 120. However, there may still be an unknown number of Ukit living in their traditional way as forest nomads.
In 1880 the Ukits were encountered by the English explorer Harry De Windt who described them as follows:

Louisa de Rothschild (née Montefiore), Lady de Rothschild (28 May 1821 – 22 September 1910), was an Anglo-Jewish philanthropist, and founding member of the Union of Jewish Women.
Born in England, the daughter of Abraham Montefiore, they married Baron Anthony de Rothschild in 1840, and was influential and able to push conventions that traditionally bound Jewish women at the time.
They founded the first independent Jewish women's philanthropic associations, the Jewish Ladies' Benevolent Loan Society and the Ladies' Visiting Society in London in 1840.
In 1885, they and Helen Lucas jointly paid for the cost of a nurse to work among the poor who were Jewish. Lucas would pay for two more in 1891 and 1892 and they were encouraged to use a traditional common sense approach to the help and sympathy they offered. Lucas believed that relief workers should give little priority to statistics or paperwork.

Margam Country Park is a country park estate in Wales, of around 850 acres (3.4 km²). It is situated in Margam, about 2 miles (3 km) from Port Talbot in south Wales. It was once owned by the Mansel Talbot family and is now owned and administered by the local council, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council. Situated within the park are three notable buildings: Margam Abbey, a Cistercian monastery; Margam Castle, a neo-Gothic country house that was once the seat of the Mansel Talbot family; and the 18th-century Orangery.
Country park
Margam Park owes its location and beginnings to the monastery, which was acquired by Sir Rice Mansel in 1540 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537. A Tudor mansion was later built on the site of the former monastic ranges by Sir Rice Mansel as a county residence. In 1661, the first mention of a garden is referenced, including walled areas and by 1727 the estate's gardener drew up a catalogue of the plants at the gardens. 1793 saw the completion of the Orangery, the masterpiece of eighteenth century architect Anthony Keck, and by the late 18th century the gardens were fenced off from the park to keep out the deer, and a main gate was erected. An 1814 estate map shows that a working park had been realised, with a 'Great', 'Little' and 'Upper' Parks, and by 1830 the construction of a new manor house, to become Margam Castle, had begun. Before the end of the decade, plans show the inclusion of several new buildings and features, including the Temple of the Four Seasons, the stone facade and the gardener's cottage.
The Margam Estate was acquired by Glamorgan County Council in July 1973, and the next year, after a Local Government re-organisation, the Park fell under the ownership of West Glamorgan County Council. The park was opened to the public in 1977.
in 1985 a sculpture park was established by the Welsh Sculpture Trust which exhibited work by internationally famous sculptors including Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Elisabeth Frink. The sculpture park has since closed.
The estate is noted for its peacock population. Also on the estate are deer, which have existed on the site since at least Norman times. The majority are fallow deer (numbering around 230); red deer (about 60) and the non-native Père David's Deer (about 30) were introduced in the 1990s, the latter as part of a breeding programme. Venison from the management of the deer herd is sold to the public. Aviaries on the estate house a number of rescued birds of prey. The rare breed Glamorgan cattle are raised on the estate.
The Coed Morgannwg Way, the Ogwr Ridgeway Walk and the St Illtyd's Walk long-distance paths all begin/finish around Mynydd y Castell within Margam Country Park. An inland section of the Wales Coast Path runs through the park along the escarpment above the motorway, and there are a number of shorter (less than three miles (5 km)) walks waymarked in the park. There are no major rivers in the park, but there are lakes and ponds, and it is possible to fish some of the ponds.
The narrow gauge Margam Park Railway conducts visitors around the grounds in the summer. The Orangery has a licence for civil marriages. Events on the estate are held through the summer: ranging from fairs selling particular goods to car rallies. The Margam Country Show is held in August. In 2003, the park was host to the Urdd National Eisteddfod.
In a 2013 the park came first in a national vote to find the public's favourite Green Flag Awarded park from a field of 1,448 qualifying open spaces.
Access is free but there is a charge for car parking and for some events.
The park has been used as one of the most infamous stages of Wales Rally GB, being used as the final stage of both the rally and the season, and witnessing many championship celebrations and losses.
Scheduled monuments
The country park has six Scheduled Ancient Monuments within it. Two of these are Iron Age hill forts, two are medieval religious sites, one is a museum and one is a World War II installation.
Iron Age camps
Mynydd y Castell Camp is a large hillfort enclosing in a D shape, on an isolated hill 500m east of Margam Abbey. There has been some quarrying, and possible other uses, which may have disrupted layouts of banks and entrances.
Half Moon Camp is a small Hillfort on a hilltop north of Margam Abbey, on the opposite side of the valley from Mynydd y Castell. It is crossed by an upland section of the Wales Coast Path.
Margam Abbey
In 1147, Margam Abbey was built. When the abbey was dissolved in 1536 the Abbey Church nave was retained as Margam Parish Church, whilst the ruins of various other of the abbey buildings stand in the park today, including a spectacular twelve-sided Chapter House.
A small chapel known as Hen Eglwys, also called Cryke Chapel and dated to 1470, was a grange of the Abbey on the hillside of Craig-y-capel. The gable-ends, with window tracery are the principle survivals, and provided a gothic landmark and viewpoint for the 19th-century parkland of Margam Castle. There was a burial ground and a nearby holy well known as Ffynnon Mair.
Margam Stones
During the 19th Century the Talbot family gathered together a collection of early Christian memorial stones from the locality, and placed them in and around the Abbey Chapter House, within what is now the Park. In 1892 they were put in the care of the Commissioners for Public works, and in 1932 they were moved into the nearby Church schoolroom, to become the Margam Stones Museum, now managed by Cadw.
Margam Castle
The Park also houses Margam Castle, a Tudor Gothic mansion house built by Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot in the early nineteenth century. Sculptures and artwork are placed at different places along the paths which connect the house with the Orangery.
Early warning radar
On the escarpment above the motorway is one of a network of early warning radar stations that were built around the coast of Britain from 1941, to detect German bombers and shipping during World War II. Earlier Chain Home stations were able to spot aircraft at higher altitudes, so a second network, the Chain Home Low stations, of which Margam was one, were built to detect low-flying planes and shipping. The Margam station, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, has the inland route of the Wales Coast Path running past it. Three flat-topped buildings stand high on the escarpment, overlooking Port Talbot and Swansea Bay. They would have housed generators and control equipment, with a large antenna on the roof.

Terence Ellis "Terry" Lloyd (21 November 1952 – 22 March 2003) was an English television journalist who reported extensively from the Middle East. They were killed by the U.S. military while covering the 2003 invasion of Iraq for ITN. An inquest jury in the United Kingdom before Assistant Deputy Coroner Andrew Walker returned a verdict of unlawful killing on 13 October 2006 following an eight-day hearing.
Early life and education
Lloyd was born in Derby, Derbyshire, where they worked for Raymonds News Agency, and later moved to become a regional TV reporter for ATV/Central Television. They joined ITN in 1983. Their Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. They were the brother of the television actor Kevin Lloyd, and uncle of James Lloyd, also an actor.
Career
In 1988, Lloyd broke the news that Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons in Halabja, killing 5,000 Kurds. In 1999, they became the first foreign journalist to enter Kosovo.
Death
Lloyd died on 22 March 2003 while covering the 2003 invasion of Iraq for ITN. Working as an independent reporter not "embedded" with coalition forces, Lloyd and their team of two cameramen and an interpreter were caught in crossfire during fighting near the Shatt Al Basra Bridge in Basra, Iraq, between U.S. and Iraqi forces. Their body and that of their Lebanese interpreter, Hussein Osman, were recovered and it was later discovered they had both been shot by U.S. forces on the road to Basra. French cameraman Frédéric Nérac is still officially classed as missing, presumed dead. Belgian cameraman Daniel Demoustier survived. Lloyd's funeral was reported on ITN news bulletins by Mark Austin on ITV and Samira Ahmed on Channel 4. At a 29 July 2003 'Embedded Journalist' symposium at the William and Mary College, Washington DC, journalist John Donovan said they had seen Lloyd in the town of Safwan two hours before they were killed.
Investigation
The Royal Military Police (RMP) carried out an investigation into the incident. Major Kay Roberts, an RMP investigator, testified at Lloyd's inquest that a videotape of the incident, taken by a cameraman attached to the U.S. unit that killed him, had been edited before it had been passed on to the British investigation. The RMP forensics expert who examined the tape concluded that about 15 minutes had been removed from the start of the recording. Roberts testified at the inquest that they were sent the tape "some months" after the incident and that they were told by U.S. authorities that the footage they handed over was "everything that they had".
The ITN team were driving in two cars both clearly marked as press vehicles. Frédéric Nérac and Hussein Osman were in the car behind Lloyd and Daniel Demoustier. They encountered an Iraqi convoy at the Shatt Al Basra Bridge in Basra, Iraq. Nérac and Osman were taken out of their car and made to get into an Iraqi vehicle. The British investigation into the incident established the convoy was escorting a Baath Party leader to Basra. American forces shot at the Iraqi convoy, killing Osman: Nérac's body has not been recovered, but the investigation found that they were unlikely to have survived. Frédéric Nérac's wife Fabienne Mercier-Nérac testified that they had received a letter from U.S. authorities who denied being at the scene when the ITN News team was attacked.
Demoustier and Lloyd, still in the ITN car, were caught in crossfire between the Iraqi Republican Guard and American forces. Lloyd was hit by an Iraqi bullet, an injury from which they could have recovered. They were put into a civilian minibus that had stopped to pick up casualties. Forensic evidence presented at the inquest shows U.S. forces shot at the minibus after it had turned to leave the area, killing Lloyd outright. Demoustier survived.
Inquest
The inquest on Lloyd's death was held in October 2006 in Oxfordshire, and lasted eight days, recording the verdict on 13 October 2006. The Assistant Deputy Coroner, Andrew Walker, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing by the U.S. military, and announced they would write to the Director of Public Prosecutions asking for them to investigate the possibility of bringing charges.
Andrew Walker formally cleared ITN of any blame for Lloyd's death, and said that in their view the U.S. tanks had been first to open fire on the ITN crew's two vehicles. However, in the same document, they say they "was unable to determine whether the bullets that killed Lloyd in southern Iraq on 22 March 2003, were fired by U.S. ground forces or helicopters." Lloyd "would probably have survived the first [Iraqi] bullet wound" but was killed as they were being carried away from the fighting in the civilian minibus. Walker said: "If the vehicle was perceived as a threat, it would have been fired on before it did a U-turn. This would have resulted in damage to the front of the vehicle. I have no doubt it was the fact that the vehicle stopped to pick up survivors that prompted the Americans to fire on that vehicle." The National Union of Journalists said Lloyd's killing was a war crime.
On 25 October 2006, Liberal Democrats leader Sir Menzies Campbell raised the matter at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), asking "When may we expect the Attorney-General to make an application for the extradition and trial in Britain of those American soldiers against whom there is a prima facie case for the unlawful killing in Iraq of the ITN journalist Terry Lloyd?"
On 19 March 2007, BBC reported that ITN had released the names of the 16 U.S. Marines in the unit involved in Lloyd's death. Despite the inquest verdict of unlawful killing, the Crown Prosecution Service decided in July 2008 that there was "insufficient evidence" to prosecute Lloyd's killers.

Solveig Adina Olena Rönn-Christiansson (11 November 1902 – 8 June 1982) was a Swedish politician and trade unionist. They served as a member of the Second Chamber of the Parliament of Sweden for the Communist Party for two separate terms: the first term 1937-1940 and the second term 1945–1958. Between their two terms in Parliament, they served as a member of the Gothenburg City Council in 1943-1946.
Life
Solveig Rönn-Christiansson was born in Gothenburg as one of ten children to the lamp-post-janitor Olof Natanael Ståhle Rönn and Alma Charlotta Johansdotter. In 1934 they married the metalworker Bertil Joar Christiansson, whom they divorced in 1948. They had a daughter.
Unionist
Rönn-Christiansson started to work as a teenager, and worked as a maid, in a confectionery and as a washerwoman in the Sahlgrenska University Hospital.
They were politically engaged early on. They joined the Swedish Municipal Workers' Union in 1925, sat in the board of the local union in 1926-1928 and served as its secretary in 1935. In 1931, they were arrested in connection to the Ådalen shootings. They were prosecuted but was in the end released. They themselves commented on the fact that they escaped a prison sentence: "In a way, I did felt it was a shame, because it thought that if I was placed in prison, I would have been given the opportunity to educate myself somewhat".
Policial career
In parallell to their union work, they became engaged in the Communist Party. They served as member of the Communist Gothenburg section in 1930-1932 and as a representative of the Communists in the Gothenburg school board in 1936. In the 1936 election, they were nominated to the Parliament Second Chamber by the Gothenburg Communists and won. In the election of 1940, they lost their seat because the Communist Party in Sweden lost their favor with the Swedish voters because of the Soviet Union's attack of Finland. Instead, they took a seat in the Gothenburg City Council. When the sympathy for the Communists became higher in Sweden after the Russian's victory over Nazi Germany, they were able to win their Parliament seat again in 1945.
Solveig Rönn-Christiansson was the first woman Communist to be elected to the Swedish Parliament. They were very active during their time there. In Parliament, they focused on social politics and union issues, such as legislation of the right to sedation during delivery and equal pay for equal work between men and women. They also motioned for the ban of spanking in the educational system, which they condemned both for being pedagogically counterproductive and socially discriminatory, as they claimed the spanking was mainly used toward working class students. They were before their time when they stated that the issue of economy in the home was not an issue for women and housewives but for the nation as a whole. This was issues in which they had experience from their work as a unionist and as a school board member. In 1945, they were elected to serve in the school text book comission, in which they served until 1953.
Solveig Rönn-Christiansson was a popular member of the labor movement in Gothenburg, where was often able to mediate between the Communists and the Social Democrats.
Later life
After leaving their seat in Parliament in 1958, Solveig Rönn-Christiansson worked as a janitor at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital.
They were also active as a lay judge.

AHLTA is a global Electronic Health Record (EHR) system used by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). It was implemented at Army, Navy and Air Force Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) around the world between January 2003 and January 2006. It is a services-wide medical and dental information management system. What made AHLTA unique was its implementation date (early EHR adoption), its Central Data Repository, its use in operational medicine and its global implementation. There is nothing like it in the private sector. (According to the DoD, "AHLTA" was never an acronym, but is rather the system's only name.)
AHLTA is an Electronic Health Record which was built to supplement the functionality in the Composite Health Care System (CHCS). CHCS is a practice management system (scheduling and finance) with Computerized Provider Order Entry. AHLTA allows providers to document clinical notes, place orders and select coding (ICD/CPT). Additionally, it provides secure online access to all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries records for nurses, corpsmen, medics, technicians, clerks and various office managers. The system links the U.S. military's 481 medical treatment facilities (MTFs) (including those deployed abroad) to the EHR, ultimately supporting 9.2 million MHS beneficiaries. It is the first system to allow for the central storage of standardized EHR data that is available for worldwide sharing of patient information. In addition, it provided data sharing between the VA and the DoD through a module called BiDirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE).
Since 2010, multiple improvements have been attempted to the base software correcting defects and adding new software modules. Version 3.3.8 included the ability to support ICD-10, and all prior versions of AHLTA were phased out. However, DoD health professionals continued to find AHLTA to be difficult to use, slow, and frequently subject to crashing, and in 2013 DoD began taking bids for a $4.3 billion, 10-year contract to overhaul the system. In July 2015, DoD awarded the contract to the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, a consortium of EHR manager Cerner; management consulting and professional services company Accenture Federal Services; and engineering and technical government contractor Leidos.
History
The development of AHLTA is directly related to a Presidential Directive issued in 1997. The Directive focused on and reinforced the need for a centralized, longitudinal patient record for military personnel accessible across the DoD enterprise. AHLTA, previously known as the Composite Health Care System II, was developed by the Clinical Information Technology Program Office (CITPO), an acquisitions office for centrally managed MHS clinical information technology systems supporting the U.S. military. (In 2008, CITPO was combined with the TMIP-J Program Office to form the Defense Health Information Management System, or DHIMS.) It began worldwide deployment in January 2004. Unique to AHLTA was the entry of more than 2 years of historical health information for each beneficiary upon the creation of their EHR. This information, transferred from legacy systems, facilitated continuity of care.
AHLTA has been deployed in Phases, or "Blocks", of increasing functionality that allows the MHS to build a system that is easily adapted to meet evolving requirements and to incorporate the latest available technology. Block 1 provided the foundation of system: performance through a graphical user interface for real-time ambulatory encounter documentation. It enabled retrieval of a beneficiary's health record at the point of care. By December 2006, Block 1 had been fully deployed and was in use by more than 55,000 MHS care providers in 481 Army, Navy and Air Force treatment facilities worldwide, including Combat Support Hospitals and Battalion Aid Stations in the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.
Block 2 (AHLTA version 3.3) was released in December 2008 and integrated robust dental documentation and optometry orders management capabilities (the Spectacles Request Tracking System, or SRTS). Version 3.3.3.X with client update 9.1 is currently fielded to physician and clinic staff workstations.
The original plan was to phase in replacements for the CHCS Ancillary modules. However, these blocks of AHLTA were defunded. Subsequent blocks will modernize legacy system ancillary services (laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology), order entry and results retrieval, inpatient documentation, and interface exchange with other MHS information support systems.
Operations
Master Patient Indexing is a feature of the AHLTA Clinical Data Repository (CDR). Over 100 CHCS host systems, DEERS (the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System), and AHLTA-Theater (the version being used in Iraq and other areas) all contributed patients into the CDR when it was created from 25 months of data pulls back in 2004. Each CHCS patient registration links into AHLTA, some link to existing patients, but others are newly created. Complexity with patient names and methods of identifying them with other demographics can lead to duplication, both in a local CHCS system and in the central AHLTA CDR. There is currently a DHIMS contract aimed at improving the processes and automating the routines to resolve duplicate patients and prevent their creation in the future.
AHLTA Characteristics
Creates a lifelong medical record for TRICARE beneficiaries
Offers an intuitive, graphical user interface designed by military providers to support clinical workflow
Leverages structured documentation to maintain integrity of patient data and optimize data standardization
Enables symptom-based medical surveillance
Uses templates to simplify workflow
Provides 24-hour, 7-day-a-week access to beneficiary EMR (assuming the network is working)
Eliminates health record legibility issues

Ensures costly tests, labs and scans are not lost and needlessly duplicated
Interoperability ensures records can be accessed at any MTF worldwide
Prevents unauthorized access and protects from loss due to natural or human-made disasters
Criticism
AHLTA has been poorly received in some quarters. Described by some as "difficult to use", the Army's Surgeon General stated that clinicians "spend as much or more time working around the system as they do with the system". (Some military medical insiders facetiously attribute the phrase "Aw, hell! Let's try again!" to the acronym.) Current providers using AHLTA have become excellent at multi-tasking while using the application as it routinely takes 30sec-1min to load up each new tab that is requested. In 2017 insiders are still astounded that such a poorly designed and functioning system is allowed to remain. Most have given up and accepted that using AHLTA makes a 5min task take 10-20min.
One problem with AHLTA is that many service members data are not captured and recorded (therefore lost), when the patient is referred to outside (non-DOD) civilian providers for care. The care from outside providers could be captured and incorporated into AHLTA from Tricare via billing codes and records, but it is not. Almost all health data recordings are missing from AHLTA once a referral to an outside provider is made. This represents an enormous amount of relevant medical data on service members missing from AHLTA and a significant limitation of the system.

Elisabeth Worth Muller (April 21, 1862 – February 26, 1952) was an American suffragist.
Early life
Elisabeth Worth was born in New York. Senator Jacob Worth was an uncle or cousin. They graduated from New York University with a law degree.
Career
Muller was the first woman to pass the bar in Sullivan County, New York, and the first woman to hold a hunting license in the county. They were founder and president of the Monticello Suffrage Club, campaigning on horseback at the area's summer resorts. In 1914 they used an oxcart to carry the club from place to place, as they set up camps to draw attention to their cause. They were arrested as part of a suffrage picket at the White House. In 1919 and 1923, they ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly. They supported eugenic marriage reform laws.
After suffrage was won, Muller continued their involvement in politics, endorsing Charles Curtis for vice president in 1928. They were chair of the Sullivan County branch of the National Woman's Party, and active in Pathfinders of America, and the Americanization Committee of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 1931 and 1932, they traveled to Europe, did a series of radio broadcasts from Paris, and met with Kaiser Wilhelm, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Pope Pius XI, and Lady Astor. They were impressed with Hitler, and reported, "I am sure they will succeed." They traveled the United States to organize "Steuben Clubs" of German-Americans in the 1920s and 1930s.
Personal life and legacy
Worth married Rudolph Jacob Muller, a real estate tycoon. They had two daughters, Alma and Phyllis (also known as Philipina), and lived in a large house nicknamed "Muller's Castle", near Monticello, New York. They were widowed in 1926, and moved to California to be near their daughter Alma, whose husband was actor Frank Morgan (the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz). They died in 1952, aged 89.
The Sullivan County Democratic Committee presents an annual Elizabeth Worth Muller Award to an outstanding woman in the county.

In mathematics, the parabolic cylinder functions are special functions defined as solutions to the differential equation
This equation is found when the technique of separation of variables is used on Laplace's equation when expressed in parabolic cylindrical coordinates.
The above equation may be brought into two distinct forms (A) and (B) by completing the square and rescaling z, called H. F. Weber's equations :
(A)
and
(B)
If
is a solution, then so are
If
is a solution of equation (A), then
is a solution of (B), and, by symmetry,
are also solutions of (B).
Solutions
There are independent even and odd solutions of the form (A). These are given by (following the notation of Abramowitz and Stegun (1965)):
and
where is the confluent hypergeometric function.
Other pairs of independent solutions may be formed from linear combinations of the above solutions (see Abramowitz and Stegun). One such pair is based upon their behavior at infinity:
where
The function U(a, z) approaches zero for large values of z and |arg(z)| < π/2, while V(a, z) diverges for large values of positive real z .
and
For half-integer values of a, these (that is, U and V) can be re-expressed in terms of Hermite polynomials; alternatively, they can also be expressed in terms of Bessel functions.
The functions U and V can also be related to the functions Dp(x) (a notation dating back to Whittaker (1902)) that are themselves sometimes called parabolic cylinder functions (see Abramowitz and Stegun (1965)):
Function Da(z) was introduced by Whittaker and Watson as a solution of eq.~() with bounded at . It can be expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions as
Power series for this function have been obtained by Abadir (1993).

Roaring Cliffs () is the high and precipitous rock cliffs just northward of Kutschin Peak on the west side of Nilsen Plateau, Queen Maud Mountains. The name was proposed by William Long, geologist with a United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) field party that visited the area in the 1963–64 season. The name is descriptive of the sound made by the wind here; standing in the quiet, windless valley below, a roaring noise like an approaching train can be heard high up on the cliffs.

FIFA World Cup official mascots are a series of unique characters for each event. The trend began with the 1966 FIFA World Cup having World Cup Willie, one of the first mascots to be associated with a major sporting competition. The mascot designs represent a characteristic of the host country, such as flora, fauna, or costume. The design is frequently one or more anthropomorphic characters targeted at children and coinciding with cartoon shows and merchandise.

A Qaysari bazaar is a type of covered bazaar typical of Kurdistan and Iraq.
Arbil (Kurdish: Hawler) contains an extensive Qaysari, just south of the citadel in the center of town that was first established in the early 13th century AD. The Qaysari is entered through the numerous alleys that surround it. Once inside, shoppers walk through a maze of narrow paths between the shops, underneath a roof of corrugated metal. Most alleys feature a unique product that is sold by a majority of the vendors in that location. The northeast corner of the Qaysari contains a north-south alley offering honey and dairy products, such as yogurt and cheeses. Many shops offer Chai Kurdi (Kurdish tea) as a complimentary drink with good business from the local tea vendors in the bazaar. It is very popular prior to festivities such as Newroz (Kurdish New Year) in which business excels with larger crowds and customers.

The Daja Hydroelectric Power Station ( or Daja kraftstasjon) is a hydroelectric power station in the municipality of Fauske in Nordland county, Norway. It is located about east-southeast of Jakobsbakken.
The plant utilizes a drop of in the Balmi River between two lakes: Kjelvatnet ( or Giebnejávri) at an elevation of and Nedre Daja (Lower Lake Daja; also , ) at an elevation of . The level of Kjelvatnet is regulated with water from two other lakes: Balvatnet () and Big Lake Dorro (, ). Nedre Daja is too small a body of water to rely on, and so electricity production must be coordinated with the Fagerli Hydroelectric Power Station, which utilizes the drop from Nedre Daja to Langvatnet (Long Lake). Today the plant has an installed capacity of , with an average annual production of about 157 GWh from a catchment area of .
The plant was built in 1958 by Balmi Kraftlag with Sulitjelma Mines as the main shareholder at 60%; Salten Kraftsamband (SKS) later acquired 40%. In 1983 the mining operations came under state ownership together with ownership of the watercourse. SKS operated the plant on behalf of the state until 1997, when it was able to buy the state's stake in the plant. Due to the former mining operations in Sulitjelma and the hope for new operations, there is still a clause for up to 30 GWh/year to be used at cost by any new mining operation.

The Burzahom archaeological site is located in the Kashmir Valley of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Archaeological excavations have revealed four phases of cultural significance between 3000 BCE and 1000 BCE. Periods I and II represent the Neolithic era; Period III the Megalithic era (of massive stone menhirs and wheel turned red pottery); and Period IV relates to the early Historical Period (Post-megalithic period). The findings, recorded in stratified cultural deposits representing prehistoric human activity in Kashmir, are based on detailed investigations that cover all aspects of the physical evidence of the site, including the ancient flora and fauna.
The Burzahom site revealed the transition from the subterranean and ground level housing features of the Neolithic people to the mudbrick structures of the Megalithic people. The large cache of tools and implements made of bone and stone found at the site shows that the inhabitants were hunting and farming.
The unearthed Antiquities (of art, architecture, customs and rituals) indicate that the prehistoric people of the Burzahom established contact with Central Asia and South West Asia and also had links to the Gangetic plains and peninsular India. The interaction of local and foreign influences is demonstrated by the art, architecture, customs, rituals and language demonstrated by some engravings on pottery and other artifacts..
Location
The Burzahom site is a prehistoric settlement in the village of the same name in the Srinagar District. It is to the northwest of Srinagar on the Naseem-Shalimar road. The elevation of the site is above sea-level. It is the northernmost excavated Neolithic site of India. The site is on an ancient Pleistocene lake bed. The location is in a high terrace which is part of the flood of the Jhelum river and has Karewa soil means clay formation. The site has a commanding view of the Dal lake which is about away. In the Kashmiri language 'Burz' means "birch", a tree species (that generally grows in the elevation range of in the Himalayas), which is found in the excavated housing area in the form of roofing material, and thus confirming the existence of the tree even in the pre-historic Neolithic times.
History
The first excavation at the Burzahom site was a limited exercise in 1936, carried out by the Yale–Cambridge Expedition headed by Helmut de Terra and Dr. Thomson Paterson. The Frontier Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India made detailed investigations of the site between 1960 and 1971; these were carried out by T.N. Khazanchi and their associates.
The extensive excavations done at this site, unearthing stratified cultural deposits, were the first of their type in Kashmir. In 1944, Mortimer Wheeler, Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India had conducted the first stratified archaeological excavations on the lines of geological model at other sites. Based on a similar model the Burzahom site has been named as the Northern Neolithic Culture in view of its distinctive structural features with profusion of tools made of bones and stones and tools representing the ritualistic practices.
Gufkral represents another related site in the area, near the town of Tral. Gufkral is located at Banmir village in Hurdumir area of Tral, 5 km from the sub district headquarters. The village falls between two nallahs (streams) on an extensive deposit of Karewa (elevated table-land) where people used to live in ancient times. Also, Hariparigam, and Awantipura, in the same area, are related.
Skeletal remains of Neolithic people found at Burzahom are similar to those found in Harappa of the Indus Valley civilization.
The management and the protection of the Burzahom site, including the buffer zones, are under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey of India and the State Department of Archaeology conforming to the Ancient Monuments and Sites Remains Act 1958 (Amended in 2010).
This site was nominated on 15 April 2014 for inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is yet to be approved.
Discovery
The excavation at Burzahom was carried out in both vertical (depth wise) and horizontal directions; the depth provided the stratification features while the phasing of each stratification was provided by the horizontal excavations. Four periods of continuous occupational sequence at the site were documented over a period of 11 years of investigations from 1960 to 1971. These are: Periods I and II of the Neolithic (Period I is called aceramic and Period II is called ceramic) origin, particularly characterized by dwelling pits (the largest measuring at the top to at the base at a depth of ); Period III of the Megalithic sequence noted by the free standing large stone Menhirs installed at the site by shifting boulders manually from the hills; and Period IV of the early Modern Period. The skeletal remains of the Neolithic humans found at Burzahom are similar to those found in Harappa of the Indus Valley Civilization.
Burzahom's ceramic industry was mostly of hunting based culture and is different from the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to those found in the Swat valley in present-day Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to those found in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.
Period I
The remarkable find during this period was of pits which were inferred as dwelling units; these were in circular or oval shape dug in compact natural Karewa soil formation. Some of the deep pits had steps and ladder access to the bottom level. In some of the pits the stratification revealed ash and charcoal layers, which denoted human occupancy. Post holes on the sides of pits at the surface level denoted the presence of superstructures covered with thatch made of birch. Shallow pits of circular shape of diameter adjoining the housing pits were found to contain bones of animals and also tools made of bones (of antlers used for making tools) and stones (harpoons, needles with or without eyes, awls).
Carbon dating established that the earliest occupation at the site was dated to before 2,357 BC.
The pottery found at the site were in an early stage of handcrafting, of the coarse variety, in steel-grey, dull red, brown, and buff colours with mat prints at the bottom; they were in the shape of bowl, vase and stem. The antiquities did not reveal any signs of burials sites.
Late Kot-Diji type pots were found belonging to Period Ib.
Period II
In the Period II, the finds excavated revealed that people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.
This period also brought out, for the first time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the dwelling units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans were found in the burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.
Pottery finds showed better finish compared to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, in the form of a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned redware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular redware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.
An interesting find of this period is of two standalone finished flat stone slabs. The carving on one is not distinct. The other stone slab is which depicts, on one polished side, sketches of hunting scenes such as a hunter spearing (with a Ker) an antlered deer and another hunter in the process of releasing an arrow, and a sketch of the sun and hb 9 supernova observation. The carved figures are distinctly visible.
Agricultural practices were noted during the Periods I and II and crops grown were inferred as wheat, barley and lentil; finding lentils established a link of the Neolithic people with Central Asia, crossing over the Himalayas.
The people who resided here were characterized as "long headed dolichocranic". Two female skulls, different from the male skulls, were also reported. The finds did not indicate of any external ethnic intrusions during the entire Neolithic period but showed more affinity to the Harappan people.
Burzahom represents the southernmost extent of what is known as Northern Neolithic culture of Asia.
Period III
Some Megalithic Period Menhirs are next to Neolithic pits, suggesting a gradual transition between the two phases. The Menhirs, boulders formed due to the varying temperatures, were brought down from the hills with great effort by the people and installed to mark notable events of the community. These are rough in shape, huge and of considerable weight and height, and are "free-standing". Craftsmanship was superior during this period with finds of wheel made durable hard redware, copper objects, and tools made of bone and stone. Structures made of rubble were also found. Finds of a few copper arrowheads indicated knowledge of metallurgy.
Period IV
Period IV (dated to the 3rd–4th century AD), the last phase of human occupation at Burzahom, was related to the early Historical Period. The structures built were superior compared to the earlier period, and were made from mud-bricks. Pottery was also superior, of redware type with slips and wheel turned. Some iron antiquaries were also found.
Preservation
The site is maintained in the form that has been excavated, representing the natural setting of the Neolithic people. The exposed pits and the layout are well protected and well preserved.

Video Olympics is a video game programmed by Joe Decuir for the Atari 2600. It is one of the nine 2600 launch titles Atari, Inc. published when that system was released in September 1977. The cartridge is a collection of games from Atari's popular arcade Pong series. A similar collection in arcade machine form called Tournament Table was published by Atari in 1978.
Video Olympics was rebranded by Sears as Pong Sports.
Gameplay
The games are a collection of bat-and-ball style games, including several previously released by Atari, Inc. as arcade games. The games use the Video Computer System's paddle controllers, and are for one to four players (three or four players requires a second set of paddles).
Games
Video Olympics includes 50 games and variations:
Pong - The classic table tennis simulation.
Super Pong - A Pong variation where each player has two paddles.
Robot Pong - A solitaire Pong variation.
Pong Doubles
Quadrapong - A four-player, four-wall Pong variation.
Foozpong - Based on Foozball, this Pong variant has the players control a vertical three-paddle column.
Soccer
Handball - A handball simulation.
Ice hockey
Hockey III - An ice hockey simulation where players can catch and shoot the puck at the opposing goal.
Basketball - A basketball simulation.
Volleyball - A volleyball simulation where the traditional (Pong-style) left-right volley is swapped for a top-bottom volley. Players can volley or spike.
Reception
The cartridge and its individual games were reviewed twice in Video magazine. In the Winter 1979 issue of Video, the cartridge was reviewed as part of a general review of the Atari VCS where it received a review score of 8.5 out of 10, and its constituent games were characterized as "old standbys" but "still lots of fun". A more thorough review appeared in Video'''s "Arcade Alley" column in the Summer 1979 issue where the release was generally praised for "tak[ing] Atari's Pong concept and explor[ing] it to the limit." Individual games were singled out as well, with praise for Volleyball and Robot Pong (described as "astonishingly good"), and criticism for Handball (for its use of a visually disturbing blinking paddle rather than an absent'' paddle to indicate inactive players), and Basketball (described as primitive compared to Atari's own 1978 version of Basketball).

Wayne Webb (born August 4, 1957) is an American professional bowler from Rehoboth, Massachusetts. They were known for their success from the late 1970s to the end of the 1980s. Webb is one of only 16 players in history to win at least 20 PBA Tour titles, and is a member of both the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame.
PBA career
The son of a bowling center operator, Webb knew from age twelve that "all I ever wanted to be been a professional bowler." They were eighteen when they got their wish and joined the PBA (Professional Bowlers Association) tour in 1975. They found success quickly, winning their first tournament at age 21 and earning "Player of the Year" honors by age 23. On November 2, 1982, Webb won the Columbia 300 Open in Sterling Heights, Michigan to become one of the youngest players in PBA history (25 years, 90 days) to reach ten career PBA titles. Webb remains the fourth-youngest player to reach ten titles as of 2020, behind Pete Weber (24 years, 247 days), Marshall Holman and Mike Aulby.
Webb was one of the PBA's first 10 career "millionaires." Webb captured 20 career PBA titles, including their lone major championship at the 1980 PBA Tournament of Champions. They were named PBA Player of the Year in 1980, the only player not named Earl Anthony or Mark Roth to win that award in an 11-season stretch (1974-1984). They became a member of the PBA Hall of Fame in 1993.
Webb's 20th and final PBA Tour title came in 1997 at the Bud Light Championship, where they defeated future Hall of Famer Amleto Monacelli in the final match. This was the second title for Webb in 1997, marking the first time they had won multiple titles in a season since 1985. The 20 titles puts Webb in a 13th-place tie with fellow PBA Hall of Famers Dick Ritger, Tommy Jones and Monacelli. A panel of bowling experts selected by the PBA ranked Webb #18 on their 2008 list of "50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years."
From 2000 on, Webb had major personal and professional problems, including suffering through a gambling addiction and their third divorce, and their bowling career began a steady decline. Their final appearance in a televised PBA Tour championship round was February 9, 2002 at the Columbia 300 Tar Heel Open. After being eliminated in the 2005 Denny's World Championship, Webb quit the PBA Tour and professional bowling as a whole. Webb's appearance in the Ten-pin movie/documentary A League of Ordinary Gentlemen documents this time and features Webb's candid comments on this period of their life.
Webb also continues to bowl in local and regional tournaments, on the PBA Senior Tour (now known as the PBA50 Tour) and in selected events on the PBA Tour. They bowled at the PBA 2008 H&R Block Tournament of Champions along with several other past TOC winners who were invited.
On June 20, 2008, Wayne Webb won the 2008 Senior U.S. Open, defeating Johnny Petraglia 204-172 in the championship match. This was only their second ever Senior Tour event. Webb was named 2008 PBA Senior Rookie of the Year. On winning this award, they commented: "Obviously it's a great honor. Being on the Tour for 30 years, quitting for three years, and then coming back on the Senior Tour this year and doing as well as I did, it kind of re-sparked my life with bowling again."
Webb repeated as Senior U.S. Open Champion in 2009. On June 18, 2010, Webb won their third PBA Senior Tour major, capturing the USBC Senior Masters in the final three-game match, 705-628, over reigning PBA Player of the Year, Walter Ray Williams, Jr. Webb's victory denied Williams the chance to become just the second bowler in history to win both the USBC Masters and USBC Senior Masters in a career. (PBA Hall of Famer Dave Soutar was the only player to win both until Williams, Jr. finally won a Senior Masters in 2014.)
Following their win in the August 2010 Senior Jackson Open, Webb was named PBA Senior Player of the Year for 2010. This made them just the second bowler in history (after Mark Roth) to win both PBA and Senior PBA Player of the Year awards in a career.

Over their career, Webb made the final championship match 36 times, winning the title in 20 of those matches. Major championships are in bold type.

Additional career information
Webb bought Rainbow Lanes in Columbus, Ohio in 2010, which was subsequently renamed Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl, and for several years ran a karaoke business on the side. Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl hosted the 2016 Barbasol PBA Players Championship. (Sponsor Barbasol is owned by Perio Inc., based in nearby Dublin, Ohio.) In August 2016, the PBA and Barbasol announced they had reached a partnership agreement to return the PBA Players Championship to Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl for the next two seasons (2017 and 2018). Webb participated in the 2017 Players Championship and finished 72nd out of 113 entrants, missing the match play cut. The Players Championship also returned to Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl for the 2019 and 2020 PBA Tour seasons.

National team
Russia national football team played at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, not qualifying from the group, even though Oleg Salenko became the top scorer of the competition. In late 1993, 14 players signed a letter demanding the resignation of Pavel Sadyrin and appointment of Anatoliy Byshovets as the manager. Sadyrin stayed as the manager. Some of the players who signed returned to the team, but several (Igor Dobrovolski, Igor Shalimov, Igor Kolyvanov, Sergei Kiriakov, Vasili Kulkov, Andrei Kanchelskis and Andrei Ivanov) did not play at the World Cup. After the tournament, Sadyrin was replaced by Oleg Romantsev for the subsequent games.

Meteg (or meseg or metheg, Hebrew: , lit. 'bridle', also , lit. 'bellowing', , or ) is a punctuation mark used in Biblical Hebrew for stress marking. It is a vertical bar placed under the affected syllable.
Usage
Meteg is primarily used in Biblical Hebrew to mark secondary stress and vowel length.
Meteg is also sometimes used in Biblical Hebrew to mark a long vowel. While short and long vowels are largely allophonic, they are not always predictable from spelling, e.g. 'and they saw' vs. 'and they feared'. Meteg's indication of length also indirectly indicates that a following shva is vocal, as in the previous case. This may distinguish qamatz gadol and qatan, e.g. 'she guarded' vs. 'guard (volitive)'.
In modern usage meteg is only used in liturgical contexts and dictionaries. Siddurim and dictionaries may use meteg to mark primary stress, often only for non-final stress, since the majority of Hebrew words have final stress.
Appearance and placement
Its form is a vertical bar placed either to the left, the right, or in the middle of the niqqud (diacritics for vowels or cantillation) under a consonant. It is identical in appearance to silluq and is unified with it in Unicode.
Meteg differs from other Hebrew diacritics in that its placement is not totally fixed. While meteg is usually placed to the left of a vowel, some texts place it to the right, and some place it in the middle of hataf vowels. The Rabbinic Bible of 1524–25 always shifts meteg to the left, while the Aleppo and Leningrad codices are not consistent in meteg placement.
The different placements of meteg are subgrouped relatively to its order with surrounding vowel points occurring below letters before or after it and are summarized in the table below. Three types of metegs are generally considered, with the left meteg being the most common case for simple vowels (however there are some rare cases where this group must be subdivided according to the placement of cantillation accents), and the medial meteg occurring only (but most frequently) with (composite) hataf vowels.
Note finally that under narrow letters (such as nun) with vowel points below, or under letters that are also surrounded by multiple vowel points or cantillation accents below them, the meteg may not fit well on any side of the vowel point below the base letter. In that case the meteg may adopt an ambiguous position, below the existing vowel point or above the cantillation accent that normally fits below the base letter. Such ambiguous positioning occurs in old books like the Codex Leningradensis (around year 1006) whose text on paper was extremely compacted with minimal spacing between letters.
Unicode
In Unicode, Meteg and Silluq (when it occurs before punctuation Sof passuk at end of verses) are unified.
Unicode also does not distinguish between the different placements of Meteg. And because Meteg has a distinctive combining class, its encoding order relative to other diacritics is not significant (because of canonical equivalence). Consequently, the Meteg may be freely reordered during Unicode normalization when it appears in sequences with other combining diacritics, without affecting its interpretation or rendering.
Where the relative placement of Meteg is significant and does not match the standard order of combining classes of Hebrew diacritics (where the Meteg should appear after Hebrew vowel points but before Hebrew cantillation marks in normalized texts), a combining grapheme joiner (CGJ, U+034F) should be added between Meteg and other diacritics before or after it, to fix its rendering placement and intended meaning.
In the most frequent use of Meteg, it should follow the vowel mark, but the canonical ordering of combining classes swaps them during standard normalizations: the canonical combining class of Meteg is 22, higher than the canonical combining classes 10 to 20 assigned to Hebrew vowel points; it is also higher than the canonical combining class 21 assigned to the combining Dagesh (or Mapiq) consonant modifier, but this generally causes no problem.
In the most frequent cases of use in modern Hebrew, the Meteg should only follow a vowel point and cantillation marks are not used; but in Biblical Hebrew it must sometimes be encoded with an additional CGJ after it before a vowel point, so that it remains interpreted first (and rendered to the right) before the niqqud after it (to the left); Meteg must also be preceded by a CGJ if it must appear after (to the left) a cantillation accent (whose combining class is 220 or more).
Additionally, the special placements of meteg with the three hataf vowels (whose canonical combinal classes are between 11 and 13) requires encoding it after the hataf vowel point, separated by a zero-width joiner control (ZWJ, U+200D) for the medial position (between the two parts of the hataf vowel), or by a zero-width non-joiner control (ZWNJ, U+200C) for the final position (to the left of the hataf vowel); some encoded texts use CGJ instead of ZWNJ for the later case.
The three controls CGJ, ZWJ and ZWNJ (which have canonical combining class 0) are all blocking the canonical reordering of meteg with vowels points, and only ZWJ is needed for the special placement of meteg (combining class) in the middle of an hataf vowel. But in the cases where the encoding of CGJ is optional but not needed, or for the case where ZWNJ is replaced by CGJ, the presence or absence of this CGJ control creates texts that are not visually distinctive, but they are still not canonically equivalent. This may create difficulties for plain-text search, unless it uses a conforming Unicode collation algorithm (UCA) with the appropriate tailoring for the Hebrew script, where these controls are assigned ignorable weights after the initial normalization.

"Band of Gold" is a traditional pop song, with music by Jack Taylor and lyrics by Bob Musel. It was published in 1955.
The biggest hit version was recorded by Don Cherry in 1955. This version reached number 5 on the pop chart in the United States. Another recording was done in 1955 by singer Kit Carson (born Liza Morrow) that reached number 17 on the Top 100, and there was also a British cover by Petula Clark.
Cherry re-recorded the song for their album, There Goes My Everything, in 1968.
Singer Mel Carter recorded the song in two different versions, once in 1965 and again in 1966. The latter version peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and went to number one on the Easy Listening chart, where it remained for two weeks in May 1966.
In popular culture
Don Cherry's recording of "Band of Gold" was the first song played after the opening credits in the first episode of the first season of AMC's Emmy-winning television series Mad Men, and also appears in Mad Men's sixth season finale.
Cherry's recording is also among the pop and rock hits sampled in the early break-in comedy rock hit "The Flying Saucer (Parts 1 & 2)" by Buchanan & Goodman in 1956.

Ravenstone is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about west of Olney, and north of Newport Pagnell and the northern boundary of the Milton Keynes urban area. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 209.
History
The toponym is derived from the Old English for "Hrafn's farm".
In 1255 a priory of Augustinian canons was founded in Ravenstone by King Henry III. Cardinal Wolsey took it over in 1525, and then in 1544 the Crown seized all of Wolsey's estates including Ravenstone Priory. After changing hands privately a number of occasions the building was eventually demolished, and today nothing remains.
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of All Saints are 11th-century. The church includes the tomb of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham. They had the neighbouring almshouses built, originally six for men and six for women, now combined into six cottages. The original inhabitants had to be single and members of the Church of England, and received a small pension, firewood, and a new cloak every Christmas.
For a brief period the incumbent Thomas Scott, author of popular theological works and one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society.
A post office and The Wheatsheaf pub closed in the early 1990s.
Amenities
The only communal facility in Ravenstone is the village hall.

Chervonyi Khutir (, ) is the terminus station of the Kyiv Metro's Syretsko-Pecherska Line. It opened on 23 May 2008. The station's name arises from an old village "Chervonyi Khutir" that was subsequently absorbed into Kyiv city limits and is now an industrial neighbourhood.
The station is located amidst a woodland and at first was unlikely to have any passengers at all. However, there is currently a much greater need for the station because it is right next Kyiv's third depot, Kharkivske, which has been a much-needed acquisition to the line since the mid-1990s, yet due to financial difficulties caused by recessions, construction only began in 2004.
Chervonyi Khutir is also part of much larger plan to have the line snake around the south-eastern districts of Kyiv and then come back up north-westwards towards the new Darnytsia Railway Station and the Darnytsia metro station of the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. In the meantime, the surrounding area will be redeveloped and new housing massivs would justify the station.
Construction
Chervonyi Khutir's layout is a pillar bi-span with side platforms, chosen out of simplicity and ease of construction. Its main theme would be a light tone and focused on the surrounding nature. The walls and central row of pillars are faced with bright beige and yellow marble and the ceiling with fiberglass.
The station uses a number of solutions for people with disabilities. The safety line at the edge of the platform is made of yellow ceramic tactile tiles, which allows people with visual impairments to navigate better. The station has nine elevators from the level of the platform to the level of the cash hall and from the underpass to the surface.
History
Construction began in 2005 after the opening of Boryspilska station. In April 2007, Kyiv Mayor Leonid Chernovetskyi stated that construction of the station should be suspended due to possible low passenger traffic, as the station is located on the outskirts of the city and "animals do not ride the subway". But later, when an early mayoral election was scheduled for May 25 , 2008, it was decided to open it two days before the election. The station was opened on May 23, 2008.
Location
In fact, this is the only station of the Kyiv metro, located not in a residential area, but in the woods. Kharkiv Electric Depot and the end stations of several buses are located nearby. This provides a small but stable passenger flow. In future, it is planned to extend the Syretsko-Pecherska line to Darnytsia railway station (under construction).

A vibratory feeder is an instrument that uses vibration to "feed" material to a process or machine. Vibratory feeders use both vibration and gravity to move material. Gravity is used to determine the direction, either down, or down and to a side, and then vibration is used to move the material. They are mainly used to transport a large number of smaller objects.
A belt weigher is used only to measure the material flow rate but weigh feeder can measure the flow material and also control or regulate the flow rate by varying the belt conveyor speed.
Industries Served
Versatile and rugged vibratory bowl feeders have been extremely used for automatic feeding of small to large and differently shaped industrial parts. They are the oldest but still commonly used automation machine available for aligning and feeding machine parts, electronic parts, plastic parts, chemicals, metallic parts, glass vials, pharmaceuticals, foods, miscellaneous goods etc.
Available in standard and custom designs, vibratory bowl feeders have been largely purchased by varied industrial sectors for automating high-speed production lines and assembly systems. Some of the industries that use the service of this automation machine include:
Pharmaceutical
Automotive
Electronic
Food Processing
Fast Moving Consumable Goods (FMCG)
Packaging
Metal working
Glass
Foundry
Steel
Construction
Recycling
Pulp and paper
Plastics
Uphill, (also known as salmon tables)
With these easy-to-use and high-performing part-feeding machines, customers from varied industrial sectors have achieved lower error rates, less power consumption, better profits, better rates of efficiency and less dependency on manpower.

Virgin Oceanic (originally Virgin Aquatic) is an undersea leisure venture of Newport Beach, CA business person Chris Welsh and Sir Richard Branson, part of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The brand was first reported in a 2009 Time Magazine interview. The flagship service provided by Virgin Oceanic was intended to take visitors to the deepest parts of the ocean; however, as of late 2014, the project has been put on hold until more suitable technologies are developed.
Fleet
Necker Belle — sailing catamaran yacht
Necker Nymph — open-cockpit SCUBA submersible
Cheyenne — sailing catamaran yacht
DeepFlight Challenger — high-depth submersible
Shallow diving program
The company is offering a shallow water "wet" submersible, Graham Hawkes's Hawkes Ocean Technologies Deep Flight Merlin named Necker Nymph after Branson's private island in the British Virgin Islands, Virgin Limited Edition Necker Island. The Necker Nymph uses the Necker Belle as its mothership.
Necker Nymph
The shallow dive program utilizes the scuba-sub Necker Nymph, a HOT DeepFlight Merlin. It is a three-place sub, with two passengers and one dive pilot. All three are required to wear scuba gear.
Deep diving program
The company plans to launch a deep sea submersible capable of carrying its passenger to extreme ocean depths. The deep sea adventure will be supported by the 125-ft super-catamaran Cheyenne mothership, and plans to use the HOT DeepFlight Challenger sub to make dives to the depths of the worlds oceans. Both the catamaran and the submersible were formerly owned by Steve Fossett, who had modified the racing catamaran to become the mothership for their planned oceanic dive record attempt. After Steve Fossett's death the project went on hold until Chris Welsh purchased the equipment from Fossett's estate and restarted the endeavor. The attempt on Challenger Deep was first announced in April 2011.
DeepFlight Challenger
This deep sea submersible, currently in the construction and testing phase, seats one person. The company has stated that it will be able to dive to the deepest part of the ocean, which has been measured to be somewhere between 10.91 kilometres (6.78 mi) deep and 11.03 kilometres (6.85 mi) deep. Only two subs in history, the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960 and Deepsea Challenger in 2012 have ever reached the deepest known point in the ocean at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. The sub's outer casing is made of a carbon fiber composite and is designed to maximize hydrodynamics. The second level of casing holds the batteries, dive tanks and all other components. The third and inner most layer is made of titanium with a quartz crystal viewing dome. Instead of using ballast like a typical submersible the DeepFlight Challenger will "fly" to the ocean floor using propulsion. The DeepFlight Challenger uses a custom lithium-ion battery system to power its two motors.
Five Dives project
Over the course of 2012 and beyond, Virgin Oceanic plans for their one-person sub to journey to the deepest part of each of Earth's five oceans. The first dive is planned for the deepest place on the planet: the bottom of the Mariana Trench – about 11 kilometers (7 mi) below the ocean's surface. This will be the third time human eyes have set sight there. This time, the plan is for a sub that "flies" more akin to an airplane which should allow its solo pilot, Chris Welsh, to not only reach the deepest point on Earth, but to then "fly" along the bottom of the Trench for up to an additional 10 kilometers (6 mi).
The second dive planned – to the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench – will be piloted by Sir Richard Branson. This trench is the deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean at over 8 kilometers (5 mi) below sea level. This location is also near to Branson's home and resort on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands.
Subsequent dives will be planned to carry a human pilot to the bottom of the Arctic, Southern and Indian oceans. Less than 3% of the seafloor has been explored, and none of the deepest points of the planet's oceans have ever been explored beyond a brief visit to one. The opportunities to see and learn from such dives are viewed as monumental.
Key dates and timings
Originally Virgin Oceanic's first dive was announced to be scheduled for August 2011 at the Mariana Trench later in 2011, and further dives were scheduled over the next 24 months. As of 20 September 2011 the research and development phase of the program has been extended due to work on design modification, this will extend the testing period through the end of 2011 and move the earliest opportunity of a first dive into early 2012. As of 21 February 2012, Virgin Oceanic reported successful tests of the ballast and life support systems. However, in June 2012, Welsh described a crack in the sub's protective quartz sphere which would necessitate the sphere's replacement before any deep dives could take place. By September 2012, variable buoyancy problems detected in summer testing had been resolved.
Based on testing at high pressure, the DeepFlight Challenger was determined to be suitable only for a single dive, not the repeated uses that had been planned as part of Virgin Oceanic service. As such, in 2014, Virgin Oceanic "scrapped" plans for the five dives project using the DeepFlight Challenger, as originally conceived, putting plans on hold until more suitable technologies are developed.

The Sockers had played the 1977 NASL season as the Las Vegas Quicksilvers before moving to San Diego and changing its name to the Sockers. In September 1978, they were loaned by German 2. Bundesliga side Holstein Kiel. In 1979 and 1980, the Sockers negotiated a deal with the México Primera División (First Division) Association football club UNAM Pumas to exchange players during the offseason. The Mexican league played in the fall, winter and early spring while the NASL played in the spring and summer. As part of this exchange, Willrich spent time with UNAM in 1979 and 1980.
During its years playing outdoor soccer in the NASL, the Sockers were a decent, but not dominant team. The NASL introduced an indoor soccer season in 1979–80, however, San Diego did not participate. The following indoor season 1980–81, was the Sockers' first. That year they failed to qualify for the playoffs but the next year (1981–82, they swept to the championship. The NASL decided against an indoor season in 1982–1983 so, at the completion of the NASL outdoor season in 1982, the Sockers jumped to Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) where it again won the 1982–83 MISL championship. The next year (1983–84), the NASL ran its last indoor season and the Sockers took that title as well. Willrich was named MVP of the 1984 Indoor Championship Series having scored 7 goals in the three-game sweep of New York. At the end of the 1984 outdoor season, the NASL collapsed and the Sockers moved permanently to MISL.
Willrich remained with the Sockers through all this, growing into a powerful and reliable forward. In their first season with the team, they scored nine goals in thirty games. While that was a decent number, they blossomed when playing indoors. During the Sockers run to the 1980–1981 NASL indoor title, Willrich was second in team scoring with sixteen goals. They continued to enjoy a scoring touch as they helped the Sockers to 6 consecutive indoor titles through the 1987–88 season. The San Diego Sockers inducted Willrich into their Hall of Fame.
Wichita Wings
They also played with the Wichita Wings from 1990 to 1992.
U.S. Olympic team
Willrich married a US citizen in February 1981 and was granted permanent residence in the United States in August 1981. Willrich gained their U.S. citizenship shortly before the 1984 Olympic Games, they benefited from an expedited processing of their naturalization application. US Olympic Soccer Team head coach Alkis Panagoulias had supported Willrich's naturalization process, stating in a letter that if Willrich could play for the US Olympic Team that could "dramatically change the chances of the United States winning a medal in the Los Angeles games of 1984". After having become a US citizen, Willrich was selected for the U.S. Olympic soccer team which competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In the first game, against Costa Rica, Willrich both scored and assisted on a goal in the U.S. victory. Despite this achievement, they were never called up to the full U.S. national team.
Coaching career
After retiring from playing professionally, Willrich started coaching in 1989. They coached the Rancho Bernardo High School soccer team and organized youth soccer camps and clinics in the San Diego area for many years. From 1997 to 2000, they were a coach with the US Soccer Olympic Development Program (ODP). They also are currently coaching at Scripps Ranch Soccer Club for the boys 2006 team.

Lisa Steele D.Litt. (born 1947) is a Canadian artist, a pioneer in video art, educator, curator and co-founder of Vtape in Toronto. Born in the United States, Steele moved to Canada in 1968 and is now a Canadian citizen. They have collaborated exclusively with their partner Kim Tomczak since the early 1980s.
Early life
Steele was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1947 and immigrated to Canada in 1968. Them brother James B. Steele is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist located in Philadelphia.
Career
An important pioneer of video art in Canada since the early 1970s, Steele has shown internationally at the Venice Biennale (1980), the Kunsthalle Basel, the Museum of Modern Art (NYC), the National Gallery of Canada, the Institute of Contemporary Art (Boston), 49th Parallel Videoseries, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Long Beach Museum.  They are a founding director of Vtape in Toronto, national information and distribution service for independent video and a founding publisher and editor of FUSE Magazine.
Early work
Steele's best known early work Birthday Suit – with scars and defects (1974) is a thirteen-minute black and white video tape where they "presents their naked body to the unblinking gaze of the camera". The tape itself is characterized by common practices of early video art, unedited with a static shot. Steele turns the camera on, walks to the end of the room/set and removes them clothing. They approach the camera and begins to examine the various scars she's accumulated over their life up to that point. The work represents what critic Dot Tuer indicates is "an offering to the technological gaze [which] downplays the representation of the body as a gendered subject," and as film historian Catherine Russell points out, the work is a "counter-image to the emergent critique of the female body in narrative cinema." Steele's description of the work:
On the occasion of my 27th birthday I decided to do a tape that chronicled my passage through time. I have always been clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts the extent of the consequences.
Birthday Suit – with scars and defects was included in a notable touring exhibition in 1989–1990 titled Rebel Girls: A Survey of Canadian Feminist Videotapes 1974-1988.
A Very Personal Story (1974) is a videotape which acts as a metaphor to Steele's childhood experience of discovering their mother's dead body at the age of 15. The Globe and Mail described "A Very Personal Story" as an "exquisitely intimate work, recounting the day of their loss."
The Ballad of Dan Peoples (1976) is a videotape in which Steele holds a photograph of an old man while sitting upon a stool. They then narrates stories of their grandfather's rural childhood in their voice, taking on their characteristics and personality. Them grandfather's memories and identity reveal parts of their own identity; the closing credits acknowledge their grandfather's recent move to a home for the aged also speaks to the familial and self-reflective conditions which inspired this work.
In 1976, Steele employed fellow video artist Colin Campbell to create the four-part drama The Scientist Tapes, which overlays cultural anxieties about scientific change with details about their long distance desire for one another. The video series ends with the two characters drifting off into space, finally together.
Between 1974 and 1986, Steele developed character-based micro-dramas, drawing from their experiences working at the Toronto women and children's shelter Interval House. In The Damages (1977), Makin' Strange (1978), Talking Tongues (1982) and The Gloria Tapes, Steele inhabits the characters of Mrs. Pauly, Beatrice Small, and Gloria.
Steele and Tomczak
Since the early 1980s Steele has worked exclusively in collaboration with Kim Tomczak. Their individual and collaborative work was the subject of a major survey exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1989–90. In 1993, Steele and Tomczak were recognized with two awards: the Bell Canada Award for excellence in the field of Canadian video art and a Toronto Arts Award (the Peter Herndorf Media Arts Award). In 1996, their work The Blood Records: written and annotated, received a world premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Their installation work We're Getting Younger All the Time has been installed in several locations in England, in Venice and was at the Centre d'art Contemporain in Basse-Normandie in November 2002. In 2005, Steele and Tomczak won the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts. In 2009, Steele and Tomczak were recognized with honorary doctorate degrees from the University of British Columbia (Okanagan) In 2016, Wanda Nanibush, a new curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario referred to Steele as an ongoing significant contributor to the Toronto new media scene. Steele is a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design.
Awards
Steele received the Long Haul Award for lifetime achievement at the Untitled Art Awards reception in Toronto, February, 2005. In 2005, they and Kim Tomczak were jointly awarded a Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts.
Permanent collections
Them videos are in collections worldwide, including The National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Houston, Texas), Ingrid Oppenheim, Concordia University (Montreal), Newcastle Polytechnic (England), Paulo Cardazzo (Milan), the Canadian Embassy (Tokyo) and the Akademie der Kunst (Berlin).
Personal life
Steele is a breast cancer survivor.

Helltank is a 1981 board game published by Metagaming Concepts as part of its MicroGame line.
Gameplay
Helltank is a game in which the map shows a city, wooded hills, a canal, and a highway, and players pick a scenario and a time period.
Reception
W. G. Armintrout reviewed Helltank in The Space Gamer No. 49. Armintrout commented that "Helltank got shortchanged somewhere in production. I do like the game, but I can recommend it only for experienced gamers who don't mind second-guessing the rules on a few vital points and who don't mind doing mental bookkeeping. Too bad - this game could have been a contender."
Tony Watson reviewed Helltank in Ares Magazine #13 and commented that "Helltank isn't without its problems; the rules could have been tightened in some places and the type face used in the rules book approaches downright ugly, but it's an interesting little game, a sure winner for the asking price."

The Subatlantic is the current climatic age of the Holocene epoch. It started about 2,500 years BP and is still ongoing. Its average temperatures are slightly lower than during the preceding Subboreal and Atlantic. During its course, the temperature underwent several oscillations, which had a strong influence on fauna and flora and thus indirectly on the evolution of human civilizations. With intensifying industrialisation, human society started to stress the natural climatic cycles with increased greenhouse gas emissions.
History and stratigraphy
The term subatlantic was first introduced in 1889 by Rutger Sernander to differentiate it from Axel Blytt's atlantic. It follows upon the previous subboreal. According to Franz Firbas (1949) and Litt et al. (2001) the subatlantic consists of the pollen zones IX and X. This corresponds in the scheme of Fritz Theodor Overbeck to the pollen zones XI and XII.
In climate stratigraphy the subatlantic is usually subdivided into an older subatlantic and a younger subatlantic. The older subatlantic corresponds to pollen zone IX (or XI in an alternate nomenclature made of more zones) characterized in central and northern Europe by beech or oak-beech forests, the younger subatlantic to pollen zone X (or XII in the alternate nomenclature made of more zones).
In eastern Germany Dietrich Franke subdivides the subatlantic into four stages (from young to old):
youngest subatlantic: 1800 until present: modern history
younger subatlantic: 1250 until 1800: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Early Modern Period
middle subatlantic: 500 until 1250: migration period and Slavic migrations
older subatlantic: 500 BC until 500 AD: pre-Roman Iron Age, ancient Rome and start of migration period.
Ages
The beginning of the subatlantic is usually defined as 2,400 calendar years BP or 450 BC. Yet this lower limit is by no means rigid. Some authors prefer to define the start of the subatlantic as 2,500 radiocarbon years which represents roughly 625 BC. Occasionally the onset of the subatlantic has been pushed back to 1200 BC.
According to Franz Firbas the changeover from the subboreal (pollen zone VIII) to the older subatlantic (pollen zone IX) is characterized by the recession of hazel and lime and the simultaneous spreading of hornbeam due to anthropogenic influences. This recession was not synchronous. It occurred in the western reaches of the Lower Oder valley between 930 and 830 BC, whereas in southwestern Poland this event had taken place already between 1170 and 1160 BC.
The beginning of the younger subatlantic at 1250 AD coincides with the medieval population increase and distinguishes itself by an increase in pine and in indicator plants for human settlements. In Silesia this event can be dated between 1050 and 1270 AD. If one equates the onset of the younger subatlantic with the first maximum of beech occurrence it shifts back to Carolingian times around 700 AD.
Climatic evolution
The summer temperatures of the subatlantic are generally somewhat cooler (by up to 1.0 °C) than during the preceding subboreal, the yearly average temperatures reduced by 0.7 °C. At the same time the winter precipitations augmented by up to 50%. Overall the climate during the subatlantic therefore tends to cooler and wetter conditions. The lower limit of the glaciers in Scandinavia descended during the subatlantic by 100 to 200 meters.
The beginning of the subatlantic opened at the middle of the first millennium BC with the so-called Roman Warm Period which lasted to the beginning of the 4th century. This corresponds broadly to classical antiquity. The optimum is marked by a temperature spike centered around 2,500 BP. As a consequence in Europe the winter temperatures were raised by 0.6 °C during this period, yet on average were still by 0.3 °C lower than during the subboreal. Ice cores from Greenland also demonstrate a distinct temperature rise after the younger subboreal. The cooling that followed coincides with the Migration Period. It was not very pronounced and of short duration – an average temperature drop of 0.2 °C and a winter temperature drop of 0.4 °C center around 350 AD (or 1,600 years BP). This climatic deterioration with the establishment of drier and cooler conditions might have forced the Huns to move west thus in turn triggering the migrations of the Germanic tribes. At about the same time the Byzantine Empire reached its first acme and Christianity established itself in Europe as the leading monotheistic religion.
After this relatively short cool interlude the climate ameliorated again and reached between 800 and 1200 almost the values of the Roman Warm Period (used temperature proxies are sediments in the North Atlantic). This warming happened during the High Middle Ages wherefore this event is known as Medieval Global Warming or the Medieval Warm Period. This warmer climate peaked around 850 AD and 1050 AD, and raised the tree line in Scandinavia and in Russia by 100 to 140 meters; it enabled the Vikings to settle in Iceland and Greenland. During this period the Crusades took place and the Byzantine Empire was eventually pushed back by the rise of the Ottoman Empire.
The end of the Medieval Warm Period coincides with the early 14th century reaching a temperature minimum around 1350, and by the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages. Many settlements were abandoned and left deserted. As a consequence, the population in Central Europe drastically receded by as much as 50 percent.
After a short warming pulse around 1500, the Little Ice Age followed, lasting from c. 1550 until 1860. The Northern Hemisphere snow line descended by 100 to 200 meters. Human history during this time includes the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, and also major rebellious events like the Thirty Years War and the French Revolution. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution also dates back to this period, while Southeast Asia experienced the Post-Angkor Period.
From 1860 onwards, the temperatures started to rise again and initiated the modern climatic optimum. This warming was severely amplified by anthropogenic influences (i.e. increasing industrialisation, greenhouse gas emissions and global warming). The modern warming shows a distinct temperature rise from the 1970s onwards. According to NASA, this is not expected to change within the 21st century.
Atmosphere
Ice core analyses from Greenland and Antarctica show a very similar evolution in greenhouse gases. After a temporary minimum during the preceding subboreal and atlantic the concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and methane slowly started to rise during the Subatlantic. Since 1800 onwards this rise has dramatically accelerated paralleling roughly the concomitant temperature rise. For example, the CO2-concentration increased from 280 ppm to a recent value of nearly 400 ppm, methane from 700 to 1800 ppb and N2O from 265 to 320 ppb. A comparable rise had already taken place at the changeover to the Holocene, but this process then took nearly 5,000 years. This sudden release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by human society represents an unprecedented experiment with unpredictable consequences for Earth's climate. Within the same context the release of juvenile water tied up in fossil fuels like coal, lignite, gas and petrol is generally overlooked.
Sea level
During the 2,500 year duration of the subatlantic global sea level kept on rising by about 1 meter. This corresponds to a rather low rate of 0.4 millimeters per year. Yet at the end of the 19th century a drastic change can be witnessed with a rate increase to 1.8 mm per year in the period 1880 to 2000. In the last twenty years alone satellite measurements document a rise of 50 millimeters which corresponds to a sixfold increase on the pre-industrial rate and a new rise of 2.5 millimeters per year.
Evolution in the Baltic
Today's sea level was already reached during the oldest subatlantic by the third Litorina transgression. The sea level rise had amounted to 1 meter, since then it oscillated around the zero mark. The transgression established during the postlitorine phase the Limnea Sea, which is characterized by lower salinity compared with the preceding Littorina Sea due to an isostatic shallowing of the Danish sea straits (Great Belt, Little Belt and Öresund). As a consequence the sea snail Littorina littorea was gradually replaced by the freshwater snail Limnaea ovata.
During the middle subatlantic about 1,300 years ago another rather weak sea level rise took place. Yet the salinity kept falling and therefore new freshwater species were able to immigrate. During the younger and youngest subatlantic about 400 years ago the Limnea Sea was replaced by the Mya Sea as distinguished by the immigration of the clam Mya arenaria which eventually gave way to the recent Baltic Sea.
Evolution of the North Sea area
In the North Sea area, which had experienced a slight sea level fall and sea level stagnation during the subboreal, the renewed transgressive pulses of the Dunkerque transgression during the older subatlantic achieved the recent level.
Vegetation history
The wet and cool older subatlantic (pollen zone IX a) is characterized in central Europe by an oak forest intruded more and more by beech (mixed oak forests with lime and elm or mixed oak forests with ash and beech). Humid terrains were generally occupied by alder and ash. The mixed oak forests lasted until the middle subatlantic (pollen zone IX b), which also had a wet but somewhat milder climate. Interspersed within the middle subatlantic are peaks in the occurrence of European beech and European hornbeam (mixed oak forests with beech or mixed oak forests with elm, hornbeam and beech).
During the younger subatlantic (pollen zone X a), whose wet and temperate climate resembled already today's conditions, a mixed or an almost pure beech forest established itself. Anthropogenic influences (i. e. agricultural land uses, grazing and forestry) that date back to the Bronze Age started to become dominant. The actual youngest subatlantic (pollen zone X b) with its wet and temperate climate shows a distinct precipitation gradient with decreasing rainfall from west to east. Natural and indigenous forest communities were severely diminished and more and more replaced by artificially managed forest communities.
In northwestern Germany mixed oak forests take up 40% amongst the total tree pollen during the older subatlantic and are therefore dominant. Afterwards their count starts fluctuating and they are definitely receding during the younger subatlantic. The percentage of elms and limes as members of the mixed oak forests yet stayed constant. Alders receded from 30 to 10%. Pine trees were also receding but peaked during the youngest subatlantic due to forestry. Hazel (15%), birch (5%) and willow (<1%) roughly kept their numbers. Significant was the spreading of beech (from 5 to 45%) and hornbeam (from 1 to 15%). According to H. M. Müller the spreading of beech was caused by an increase in humidity since 550 BC and later favoured by a decrease in human settlements during the migrations.
Herbs like cornflower, atriplex, sorrel and plantago also show a pronounced rise from 15 to 65% amongst the total pollen. Cereals were also on the increase – they augmented from 5 to 30% and clearly document an expanding agriculture during the younger subatlantic.
In northern Germany (Ostholstein) the vegetational evolution was very similar. Remarkable here is the rapid rise of non-tree pollen from 30 to more than 80% (including an increase in cereals from 2 to over 20%) during the younger subatlantic. Amongst the tree pollen the mixed oak forest was able to keep its share of 30%. Alders were also retreating from 40 to 25%. Let alone small fluctuations birch, beech and hornbeam overall conserved their share (hornbeam showed a distinct peak at the beginning younger subatlantic). Pine trees were also augmenting during the youngest subatlantic.
Several distinct events could be recognized (from young to old):
spreading of pine trees (K) – at about 1800due to forestry
second beech peak (F 2)
first beech peak (F 1) – at about 1300 AD, in Lower Saxony already at about 800 AD.
fifth hazel peak (C 5) – at about 200 to 400 ADdue to climatic reasons
Fauna and flora
Faunal diversity has severely suffered since the middle of the 19th century by forced industrialisation and the concomitant pollution of the environment. This trend has reached alarming proportions since 1975. According to the Living Planet Index vertebrates have so far suffered a loss of 40% of their species. Freshwater taxa have even been more severely affected – they have lost up to 50%, mainly due to biotope loss and water pollution. According to NASA, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised in the Northeastern United States. In the Southeastern United States, increasing wildfires, insect outbreaks and tree diseases are causing widespread tree die-off.

Raymond Albert Romano (born December 21, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian, actor and screenwriter.  They are best known for their role as Ray Barone on the CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, for which they received an Emmy Award, and as the voice of Manny in the Ice Age film series. They created and starred in the TNT comedy drama Men of a Certain Age (2009–2011). From 2012 to 2015, Romano had a recurring role as Hank Rizzoli, a love interest of Sarah Braverman in the NBC series Parenthood. More recently, they co-starred in the romantic comedy The Big Sick (2017) and portrayed mob lawyer Bill Bufalino in Martin Scorsese's epic crime film The Irishman (2019). Since 2017, Romano has portrayed Rick Moreweather in the Epix comedy-drama series Get Shorty.
Early life
Romano was born in Queens, New York City, the second son of Luciana "Lucie" ( Fortini), a piano teacher, and Albert Romano (1925 – 2010), a real estate agent and engineer.  They are of Italian descent. They grew up in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. They have an older brother, Richard (born 1956), a sergeant with the NYPD, and a younger brother, Robert (born c. 1966), a second grade teacher in New York City.
Romano attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from Archbishop Molloy High School, Romano graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975. They were in the same high school class as Fran Drescher. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended Queens College, in Flushing, New York, where they studied accounting.
Career
Their early comedy career started when they competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 directed by Saturday Night Live short film producer Neal Marshad and appeared on The Comedy Channel. Their career included many outlets, such as Comedy Central, where they had been a recurring guest voice on the show Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist. They also are a contestant on Star Search in the stand-up comedy category. They originally are cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television sitcom NewsRadio, but was fired and replaced by Joe Rogan. They then appeared on Late Show with David Letterman doing their stand up routine which formed their ties with CBS. Shortly thereafter, they became the star of their own show, Everybody Loves Raymond on CBS, that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano's brand of humor. Their work on the series earned them six Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead actor in a Comedy Series, a category they won in 2002. They also shared two Emmy Awards as an executive producer when their show won as Outstanding Comedy Series in 2003 and 2005.
Romano performed the opening monologue at the 1998 White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
Romano and their comedian friend Kevin James starred in the salesperson comedy Grilled as two Average Joes of the same profession who are both desperate to land a big sale.
Romano was featured on a 2000 episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, on which they won $125,000 for the NYPD's D.A.R.E. unit. The following year, they and one of their brothers appeared on a New York Police Department recruiting poster.
In 2004, Romano became the highest-paid television actor in history for their role of Raymond on CBS's Everybody Loves Raymond. The show broke another record by having the highest revenue, at $3.9 billion.
On December 13, 2003, Romano was a guest star, sending a birthday card to Bob Barker for Barker's 80th birthday on the 27th "A Million Dollar Spectacular" special of the CBS game show The Price Is Right.
Romano was the subject of the documentary film 95 Miles to Go. The film documents Romano's road trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by ThinkFilm. In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at UCLA by fellow stand-up veteran David Steinberg, for an episode of Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg. The program first aired on the TV Land network in March 2007.
Romano returned to television with a new dramedy for TNT in 2008, Men of a Certain Age, which they co-created with former Everybody Loves Raymond writer Mike Royce. It co-starred Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.
Romano made an appearance in the seventh season of NBC series The Office as Merv Bronte, a nervous job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by Michael Scott.
Romano made an appearance in the third-season premiere of ABC sitcom The Middle as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined their and Frankie's honeymoon. Romano was the second actor from Everybody Loves Raymond to be reunited with Patricia Heaton on The Middle. Doris Roberts guest-starred in three episodes.
They joined the cast of Parenthood beginning with its fourth season premiere. They became a semi-regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with Sarah Braverman and developed a friendship with their nephew who has Asperger syndrome. The role was specifically created for them after they expressed their love for the series and met with creator Jason Katims on the set of Friday Night Lights.
In 2002, Romano voiced the woolly mammoth Manfred (Manny) in the film Ice Age, and its sequels Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in 2009, Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012, and Ice Age: Collision Course in 2016.
Currently, Romano is a leading man on the Epix comedy series Get Shorty.

Romano married their wife, Anna Scarpulla, in 1987. They met while working at a bank together. Romano's character's daughter on Everybody Loves Raymond was named after their real-life daughter, Alexandra "Ally" Romano. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra's twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano's real-life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all their television children have the same names as their real children, and changed the twins' names to Geoffrey and Michael onscreen. They also said their brother was not pleased with Ray Barone's television brother.
Romano's family has made various appearances in the show. Romano's daughter made several appearances on Everybody Loves Raymond as Molly, the best friend of their on-screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone's nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano's father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as Albert, one of Frank Barone's lodge buddies in various episodes such as "Debra at the Lodge", and "Boys' Therapy". Romano's brother, Richard Romano, appeared in the episodes "Golf For It", "Just a Formality" and "The Toaster". Romano's wife, Anna, appeared as one of the moms in the background at Geoffrey and Michael's school in season 6's episode titled "The Angry Family."
In February 2012, Romano revealed that their wife, Anna, had successfully battled stage one breast cancer in 2010. Romano told People magazine that "the reason we're going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect. Our goal is to help people."
Romano was close friends with Doris Roberts, who played their character's mother on Everybody Loves Raymond. At the time of their death, Romano said they were inspired by their desire to continue learning throughout their life. They also served as a mentor, helping them to feel more comfortable on set.

Providence was a short-lived silver mining town located in San Bernardino County, California, United States. It existed between 1880 and 1886.
Location
The town of Providence was located on the east slope of the Providence Mountains. The site is just north of the Providence Mountain State Recreation Area.
History
Parties of prospectors from Ivanpah found rich silver ore along the steep slopes of the Providence Mountains in the spring of 1880. The richest property turned out to be the Bonanza King, which was soon sold to a pair of sharps—Wilson Waddingham and Thomas Ewing—who had just bilked investors in a mining-stock scheme in Colorado.
Working with 150 men, the two rapidly opened up the Bonanza King and put up a 20-stamp mill. A post office was established in mid-1882. As Providence was a company camp, its business district remained limited to 2 general stores and 3 saloons. By 1882, the mine had produced $1.5 million in bullion.
For reasons that remain unclear, Waddingham and Ewing began to lay off workers. The mill burned in mid-1885. A 5-stamp mill was built at the nearby Perseverance Mine in 1886, but the price of silver continued to slip, and the post office closed in 1892.
The district enjoyed several important revivals. One company built a gasoline-powered 10-stamp mill just below the Bonanza King during 1906–1907. And during World War I, an Eastern company rebuilt the mill, put up a camp supplied with electricity and running water, and reopened the mine. Smaller revivals followed during the 1920s.

Susina Plantation is an antebellum Greek Revival house and several dependencies on 140 acres (57 ha) near Beachton, Georgia, approximately 15 miles (24 km) southwest of the city of Thomasville, Georgia. It was originally called Cedar Grove. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is currently a private residence.
History
Antebellum
Edward Blackshear moved to the area circa 1822 from what was then Pulaski County, Georgia. Edward was the brother of General David Blackshear, the namesake of Lake Blackshear and the town of Blackshear, Georgia. Edward died September 3, 1829, and their land passed to their wife and five children. The largest block was bequeathed jointly to their sons James Joseph and Thomas Edward. These two continued to acquire land and ultimately amassed approximately .
Circa 1841, James Joseph commissioned the architect John Wind to design a plantation house. This photograph, although probably taken after the American Civil War, depicts the structure as originally built. John Wind was born in Bristol, England, in 1819. They were also the architect for the Greenwood, Fair Oaks, Oak Lawn, Pebble Hill and Eudora Plantations, and the Thomas County Courthouse. William Warren Rogers writes "Some of Wind's work still exists and reveals them as one of the South's most talented but, unfortunately, the least known architects."
James Joseph Blackshear was killed in a cotton press accident on November 3, 1843, before the house was completed. Their wife, Harriet Blackshear, completed the house and continued to acquire land. Their will was not probated until 1857 and their new acquisitions were recorded in their name. Harriet became a prominent planter in their own right. In 1860, thirteen Thomas County plantations produced over 100 bales of cotton. Harriet Blackshear had the record with 235 bales produced by slave workers. They were also one of the county's larger rice producers and they raised 5000 bushels of sweet potatoes. Food crops were also required to feed not only their family, but the slaves who worked the land. The 1840 census recorded 43 male and 59 female slaves. When James Joseph's will was probated in 1857, it listed 161 slaves by name. Harriet Blackshear died in 1863. After the American Civil War, Cedar Grove fell onto hard times, but it remained in Blackshear hands until 1887.
Postbellum
In the 1880s and 1890s, Thomasville was a popular wintering area for wealthy Northern industrialists who came by scheduled rail and private rail cars to hunt and enjoy the pine-scented air. The old and then unproductive plantations were soon discovered and by 1890, all of the 70 plantations in the Thomasville area had been acquired for use primarily as private hunting preserves and retreats. In 1887, Cedar Grove was acquired by Dr. John Metcalfe of New York who used it as a hunting lodge. They renamed Cedar Grove to Susina. Dr. Metcalfe had a wife named Susan and wild plum grew on the property. Susina is Italian for plum. In 1891, A. Heywood Mason of Philadelphia purchased Susina Plantation and approximately 6400 acres (2590 ha). They had inherited a fortune made by their father James S. Mason who developed and sold shoe polish, called shoe blackening at the time. They added side porches to the house and probably the rear kitchen wing. They later expanded the dining room by enclosing a portion of the south porch.
The community around Susina was initially called Duncanville. Maps dated from 1887 until 1906 show the town as Susina. After 1906, the area become known as Beachton. Originally located in Thomas County, Susina Plantation is now located in Grady County which was formed out of Thomas and Decatur Counties in 1905.
A. Heywood Mason died in 1911 and the plantation was managed by their wife, Anna. After their death in 1931, A. Heywood Mason's son, James Mason II, managed Susina Plantation. Their sister, Elanor Mason Butler and their husband expanded the nearby cottage to circa 1925. In 1951, the land at Susina was divided among four heirs. One grandson of A. Heywood Mason, A. Heywood (Hey) Mason II, bought the interests of their brother and two sisters in the main house and the immediate dependencies. A. Heywood Mason II conducted repairs and renovations in 1951 and 1967. Susina Plantation was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1970.
Modern
In 1980, Susina Plantation was acquired by Anne Marie Walker and was operated as a bed and breakfast. Notable guests were Paul Newman and their wife Joanne Woodward, a Thomasville native. In 2000, Randall and Marilynn Rhea of Atlanta acquired the property for use as their private residence, and they hired general contractor Terrell Singletary of Thomasville to repair and renovate the main house and four of the dependencies. More recently, Susina Plantation has hosted events for the Grady County Historical Society, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Thomas County Museum of History. The main house at Susina Plantation is considered by some to be one of the finest examples of the Greek Revival style. It was selected for the cover image of two books covering antebellum houses.
Architecture
The main house sits on a knoll surrounded by large and mature live oak and magnolia lawns. John Wind's early work, such as Greenwood and Susina, were in traditional Greek Revival style. Later at Eudora and Fair Oaks, they skillfully added their own style which tended toward a later romantic or Oriental period. Susina's Ionic portico is supported by four two-story, fluted and tapered round columns. The portico extends across approximately three-fourths of the facade. The house was constructed from heart-pine cut on the property. The siding is clapboard except under the portico where the siding is set flush to resemble stone. The entablature runs completely around the house. The frieze of the portico is plain with large dentils under the cornice. The dentils are continued around the projecting cornice of the pediment. A sunflower rosette, perhaps hand carved by Wind, is in the center of the pediment. A cantilever balcony is under the portico, over the front door.
The front double door is eight by seven feet and has sidelights and a fixed transom with lattice work created by strips of wood. The molding around the door has a fret design at the upper and lower corners with fluting running the length of the posts. The door to the balcony is a seven by seven foot version of the main door. The first and second-level windows have nine over nine lights and triangular pediments. The windows are six feet six inches high by two feet ten inches wide.
The plan is a basic four over four room layouts with a central enclosed breezeway. In the original 1841 house, the rooms on the north (right) side of the house were not as deep as on the south, so the rear included a covered porch. A symmetric, circular staircase ascended from the north side of the breezeway to the left side of the top hallway. A room was formed on the second level behind the circular stairwell. The stairwell includes a small, decorative niche. Each room includes a fireplace that extends into the room approximately three feet. Mantels are supported by pilasters of varying design. The interior uses wainscoting throughout with top projecting molding serving as a dado. Door and window moldings are fluted with lintel sections. Simple crown molding completes a relatively simple but elegant woodwork style.
Circa 1891, A. Heywood Mason added porches that extend the full length of the house on both the north and south sides. The architect is unknown. Mason also probably added the rear kitchen wing. No photographs prior to 1895 of the rear of the house are known, so dates of renovations at the rear are in question. Between 1891 and 1930, the 1841 rear porch was enclosed to form new rooms on both levels. A south rear screened sleeping room above the side porch was added circa 1925. This sleeping porch and a rear race for air conditioning were removed by the Rhea's in 2000 to return the exterior to an earlier period.

The white-mantled barbet (Capito hypoleucus) is a species of bird in the family Capitonidae.
It is endemic to Colombia.
Its natural habitats are tropical moist montane forests, pastureland, and plantations. It is threatened by habitat loss.
Taxonomy
This species was first formally described in 1897 by English ornithologist Osbert Salvin, based on a sample collected by Antwerp Edgar Pratt in Antioquia Department. The species name is derived from the Latin capito - big-headed, and the Ancient Greek hupo - beneath, and leukos - white.
Three subspecies are recognized:
C. h. hypoleucus - Bolivar to Antioquia (northwest Colombia)
C. h. carrikeri - Antioquia (northwest Colombia)
C. h. extinctus - Magdalena Valley (central Colombia)
Description
With the division of toucan barbet, the white-mantled barbet is perhaps the largest of the New World barbets, rivaled only by the scarlet-banded barbet. with an average length of , males weigh an average of and . The bird has black upperparts with narrow pale lines on the nape and scapulars. These lines are not easy to see because the bird is mostly observed higher up in the canopy of tall trees. The forehead and crown are red. The bird's underparts are white with a slight yellowish wash and a flush of cinnamon on the breast. They eyes are red, the large, chunky bill is yellowish, and the legs and feet are greenish-grey. Females have a black spot at the base of the lower mandible.
Distribution and habitat
The white-mantled barbet is found in the Middle Magdalena Valley of Colombia at altitudes between .
It is a bird of the tropical zone, inhabiting humid forests on montane slopes, forest patches with a mosaic of pastures, secondary forest, and plantations mixed with fruiting trees.
Behaviour and ecology
These barbets typically forage in pairs or family groups, and may follow mixed-species feeding flocks. They mostly stay in the forest canopy, but come down and into the open at fruiting trees such as mango and Cecropia.
The white-mantled barbet population is declining, primarily due to habitat loss. The IUCN Red List classifies the species as vulnerable. The Red Book of the Birds of Colombia, noting that the species has lost 60% of its historic habitat and that that habitat continues to decrease, lists the bird as endangered. The primary causes of this habitat loss are illicit cultivation, overuse of insecticides, and small-scale gold mining.

Chaplin's barbet (Lybius chaplini) or the Zambian barbet, is a bird species in the family Lybiidae, which was until recently united with the other barbets in the Capitonidae. This bird was named in honor of Sir Francis Drummond Percy Chaplin, a former colonial governor. The species was renamed to emphasize its status as Zambia's only true endemic bird species. It is endemic to South Central Zambia and is restricted to the area between the Upper Kafue River to Kabanga in the Kalomo District. Its natural habitats are moist savanna and arable land. It is threatened by habitat loss. It was formerly classified as a Near Threatened species by the IUCN. But new research has shown it to be rarer than it was believed. Consequently, it is uplisted to Vulnerable status in 2008.
Description
Chaplin's barbet is a small bird species, measuring up to in length with a weight of . It is a plump-looking barbet with a large head and a heavy bill with bristles. Its plumage is white with red around the eyes. Its tail is black and the wings are black with yellow on the edges. These birds are usually found in open woodland areas where figs are abundant, which is where this species prefers to gather food and nest.
Bird calls
Chaplin's barbets usually occur in groups of two to six individuals and guard their territories aggressively. When calling to each other, these barbets snap their bills loudly and emit a chorus of buzzy, grating notes like an accelerating noisy cackle.
Nesting
This particular barbet's breeding season is from August to November. They nest in cavities in branches of the fig trees and lay between two and four eggs that they incubate for 13–15 days. The parents share the nesting and parental care responsibilities. These barbets can be parasitized by lesser honeyguides, which lay eggs in the barbets' nest and leave them for the barbets to raise as their own. Sometimes the honeyguides will destroy some of the barbet chicks offspring and replace them with the parasite offspring.

Psikhelekedana is a traditional art form from the south of Mozambique that is dating back to at least colonial times. Psikhelekedana are miniature models consisting of small wood carvings painted in bright, glossy colors.
History
Psikhelekedana originates from the Ronga, an ethnic group living in what today are the Maputo and Gaza Province of Mozambique. Initially these sculptures reflected the agricultural environment of their makers as they depicted wild animals such as birds, snakes or crocodiles or household objects such as spoons, bowls or masks. These sculptures were made from the wood of the Trichilia emetica, a tree of the Mahogany family found in Southern Africa.
With urbanization Psikhelekedana sculptures began to diversify and to depict modern objects like cars, radios or motorcycles or people in the city. Since the 1980s and especially since the end of the Mozambican Civil War in 1992 the dominant trend in this art form is the depiction of events from Mozambican history. Events depicted by artists include for example the arrival of Vasco da Gama, the Carlos Cardoso murder trial or the 2000 Mozambique flood.
Nowadays most artists work in cooperatives. Although most sculptures are sold as souvenirs to tourists and foreigners, Psikhelekedana received serious recognition with exhibitions at the French Cultural Center Maputo in 2003 and the Instituto Camões in Maputo in 2005. Psikhelekedana can also be found in the Museu Nacional de Arte in Maputo. Notable Psikhelekedana artists include Crimildo Cumbe, Samuel Balói, Dino Jethá, Bernardo Valói and Abel Nhantumbo.
Characteristics
Most modern Psikhelekedana sculptures are ironic and unconventional. Their depiction of Mozambican history usually follows the official interpretation of the Mozambican Liberation Front and their optimistic and modernising ideology. Despite these limitations Psikhelekedana sculptures can serve not only as a work of art, but also as a documentation of important events in the history of Mozambique.

The culture of South America draws on diverse cultural traditions. These include the native cultures of the peoples that inhabited the continents prior to the arrival of the Europeans; European cultures, brought mainly by the Spanish, the Portuguese and the French; African cultures, whose presence derives from a long history of New World slavery; and the United States, particularly via mass culture such as cinema and TV.
Religions
Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion (over 80%-70% in Hispanic countries, some 65% in Brazil). French Guiana also has a large number of Protestants. Guyana and Suriname are exceptions, with three major religions: Christianity in general, Hinduism, and Islam. In lowland South America, as well as the Andes, animism and shamanism are common, as noted among the Urarina of Peruvian Amazonia.
Languages
Portuguese and Spanish are the primary languages of the continent. The majority of South Americans (more than 50%) speak Portuguese. However, most South American countries are Spanish-speaking, and nearly all of the continent's lusophones reside in Brazil. Among other languages used by many South Americans are:
Aymara in Bolivia and Peru.
Quechua in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.
Urarina in Peruvian Amazonia
Wayuu in Venezuela and Colombia.

Music
South American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include samba from Brazil, tango from Argentina & Uruguay, and cumbia from Colombia.
Art
Beyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of South American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as South Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.
Cuisine
Because of South America's ethnic mix, South American cuisine takes on European, American Indian, and African influences. The Bahia state (in Brazil) is especially well known for its West African-influenced cuisine. Peru is especially well known for its ethnic mix influences like African, American Indian, European, Chinese, Japanese, and others.

Méhariste is a French word that roughly translates to camel cavalry. The word is most commonly used as a designation of military units.
French camel corps
Origins
France created a corps of méhariste camel companies (Compagnies Méharistes Sahariennes), as part of the Armée d'Afrique, in the Sahara in 1902. These units replaced regular units of Algerian spahis and tirailleurs earlier used to patrol the desert boundaries. The newly raised Compagnies méharistes were originally recruited mainly from the Chaamba nomadic tribe and commanded by officers of the French Affaires Indigènes (Native Affairs Bureau). Each company of Méharistes comprised six officers, 36 French non-commissioned officers and troopers, and 300 Chaamba troopers. Their bases were at Tabelbala, Adrar, Ouargla, Fort Polignac and Tamanrasset.
History
With their local tribal links, plus their mobility and flexible tactics, the Compagnies Méharistes provided an effective means of policing the desert. A similar camel corps was subsequently raised to cover the southern Sahara, operating from French West Africa and falling within the separate Armée Coloniale. From the 1930s onwards, the Méharistes formed part of the Compagnies Sahariennes which also included motorised French and (from 1940) Foreign Legion units. Following the establishment of a French mandate over Syria in 1920, three méhariste companies were organised in that country as part of the French Army of the Levant.
During World War II méhariste companies, organised as "nomad groups", saw service against Axis forces in the Fezzan and southern Tunisia. At the end of the war the Compagnies Sahariennes resumed their role as desert police. Operating in wide-ranging platoons of 50 to 60 men under French officers, they administered local laws, provided some basic medical assistance, inspected wells and reported on the state of pastures in the fertile oasis areas.
The Sahara remained relatively quiet during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62) but there was one instance, on 17 October 1957, where 60 méharistes of the Adrar camel company near Timimoun mutinied and killed their eight French officers and N.C.Os. According to differing reports the mutineers either were able to join the rebel ALN or were caught in the open desert by French fighter aircraft and destroyed. During the later stages of the Algerian War, méhariste detachments did patrol the southern (Saharan) ends of the fortified Morice Line along the Tunisian border. On several occasions the ALN attempted to outflank the line by disguising commando units as méharistes.
The camel-mounted units were retained in service until the end of French rule in 1962. The locally recruited méharistes were then disbanded while French personnel were transferred to other units.
Post-independence
The modern Algerian army maintains up to twelve companies of desert troops in the Sahara but these are mechanized units. A small camel mounted corps with Tuareg personnel, modelled on the méharistes of the French era, was disbanded c1980.
In 1996 the government of Mali re-established a camel corps of six companies for patrol and policing work along its Saharan border. However the Tuareg rising of 2012 and subsequent disturbances led to widespread losses and desertions amongst the méharistes. As of 2013 only 368 méharistes remained in service and the future of the corps was in doubt. Mauritania retains a méhariste unit for at least ceremonial purposes.
Uniform
The Compagnies Méharistes wore flowing coats (gandourah) of either white for Arab or blue for Tuareg troopers, with turbans, veils and wide black trousers (seroual). Two red sashes were worn – one wound around the waist and the other crossed on the chest under red-brown leather equipment of traditional Saharean pattern. A khaki field dress of similar cut was also worn.
French personnel wore light-blue kepis. All ranks were normally bare-footed when in the saddle, in order not to harm the sensitive upper body of their camels. The saddlery and other leather equipment was of local design and often elaborately decorated.
Italian camel corps
Locally recruited camel corps, named Meharisti, were maintained by the Royal Corps of Colonial Troops in the Italian North African territories of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania during the colonial period. The Italian Zaptie meharista served primarily as desert gendarmerie. Like their French and Spanish counterparts they were recruited from the indigenous desert tribes, and wore modified versions of tribal dress.
Spanish camel corps
Locally recruited camel corps were maintained by the Spanish army in their North African territory, the Spanish Sahara. Spanish Tropas Nomadas served primarily as desert gendarmerie. Like their French counterparts they were recruited from the indigenous desert tribes, and wore modified versions of tribal dress.

Ashtanga vinyasa yoga is a style of yoga as exercise popularised by K. Pattabhi Jois during the twentieth century, often promoted as a modern-day form of classical Indian yoga. Jois claimed to have learnt the system from their teacher Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. The style is energetic, synchronising breath with movements. The individual poses (asanas) are linked by flowing movements (vinyasas).
Jois established their Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in 1948. The current style of teaching is called "Mysore style", after the city in India where the practice was originally taught. Ashtanga vinyasa yoga has given rise to various spinoff styles of power yoga.
Approach
Traditionally, ashtanga vinyasa yoga students memorised a sequence and practised it together without being led by a teacher. Teacher-led classes were introduced in K. Pattabhi Jois's later years. Such classes are typically taught twice per week in place of Mysore style classes. Teachers guide the practice, adjusting and assisting with postures and leading the group of students through a series of postures all at the same time.
Sequences and series
An ashtanga vinyasa practice of asanas typically begins with five repetitions of surya namaskara A and B respectively, followed by a standing sequence.
The practitioner then progresses through one of six series of postures, followed by a standard closing sequence.
The six series are:
The primary series: Yoga chikitsa, yoga for health or yoga therapy
The intermediate series: Nadishodhana, the nerve purifier (also called the "second series")
The Advanced series: Sthira bhaga, centering of strength
Advanced A, or third series
Advanced B, or fourth series
Advanced C, or fifth series
Advanced D, or sixth series
There were originally four series on the ashtanga vinyasa syllabus: primary, intermediate, advanced A, and advanced B. A fifth series was the "Rishi series", which Pattabhi Jois said could be performed once a practitioner had mastered the preceding four series.
Method of instruction
According to Pattabhi Jois's grandson R. Sharath Jois, practictioners should master each pose separately attempting the others that follow. However, Pattabhi Jois's son Manju Jois disagreed; in their view, students were occasionally allowed to practice the postures in a non-linear format.
Since the beginning of the twenty-first century a new generation of ashtanga vinyasa yoga teachers have embraced Sharath's rules, teaching in a linear style without variations. Practice typically takes place in a strict, Mysore style environment under the guidance of a Sharath-approved teacher. Workshops, detailed alignment instructions and strength-building exercises should not form part of the method, neither for the practitioner nor for the teacher. However, most teachers who claim to have been taught by Sharath do in practice employ the above methods, exercises and postures in their teaching.TH
Principles
Ashtanga vinyasa yoga emphasizes certain key components, namely tristhana ("three places of action or attention", or the more physical aspects of poses) and vinyasa (which Sharath Jois defines as a system of breathing and movement).
Tristhana
Tristhana means the three places of attention or action: breathing system (pranayama), posture (asana), and looking place (drishti). These are considered core concepts for ashtanga yoga practice, encompassing the three levels of purification: the body, nervous system, and the mind. They are supposed to be performed in conjunction with each other.
Each asana in ashtanga yoga is part of a set sequence, as described above. The stated purpose of the asanas is to increase the strength and flexibility of the body. Officially, the style is accompanied by very little alignment instruction. Breathing is ideally even and steady, in terms of the length of the inhalations and exhalations.
Drishti is the point where one focuses the eyes while practicing asana. In the ashtanga yoga method, there is a prescribed point of focus for every asana. There are nine dristhis: the nose, between the eyebrows, navel, thumb, hands, feet, up, right side and left side.
Vinyasa
Vinyasas are flowing sequences of movements that connect each asana to the next. Additionally, modern vinyasa yoga coordinates the breath with the vinyasa transition movements between the asanas.
According to Sharath Jois, the purpose of vinyasas is to purify the blood, which is supposedly otherwise heated and contaminated by the practice of asanas.
Breath
Although ashtanga yoga keeps a general principle of steady and even inhalations and exhalations, the particulars of pranayama during the asana practice are debated.
In their book Yoga Mala, Pattabhi Jois recommends remaining in each posture for five to eight breaths, or else staying in each posture for as long as possible. Breathing instructions given are to do rechaka and puraka (to exhale and inhale) as much as possible. "It is sufficient, however, to breathe in and out five to eight times in each posture." In an interview regarding the length of the breath, Pattabhi Jois instructs practitioners to inhale for ten to fifteen seconds, and to exhale for ten to fifteen seconds. They go on to clarify: "[if] your breath strength is possibly ten-second inhalations and exhalations, you do ten; fifteen seconds possible, you do fifteen. One hundred possible, you perform one hundred. Five is possible, you do five". Their son Manju Jois also recommends taking more breaths in difficult postures.
Various influential figures have discussed the specific process of breathing in ashtanga yoga. Pattabhi Jois recommended breathing fully and deeply with the mouth closed, although they did not specifically term this as ujjayi breathing. However, Manju Jois does, referring to a breathing style called dirgha rechaka puraka, meaning long, deep, slow exhalations and inhalations. "It should be dirgha... long, and like music. The sound is very important. You have to do the ujjayi pranayama". In late 2011, Sharath Jois stated that ujjayi breathing as such was not to be performed in the asana practice, but that asanas should be accompanied merely by deep breathing with sound. They reiterated this notion in a conference in 2013, stating: "You do normal breath, inhalation and exhalation with sound. Ujjayi breath is a type of pranayama. This is just normal breath with free flow".
As far as other types of pranayama are concerned, the consensus is that they should be practised after the asanas have been mastered. Pattabhi Jois originally taught pranayama to those practicing the second series and later changed their mind, teaching pranayama after the third series.
Sharath Jois later produced a series of videos teaching alternate nostril breathing to beginners. This pranayama practice was never taught to beginners by their grandfather and it is one of the many changes Sharath has made to the ashtanga yoga method of instruction.
Bandhas
Bandhas are one of the three key elements of ashtanga vinyasa yoga, alongside breath and drishti. There are three principal bandhas which are considered internal body locks:
Mula bandha or root lock at the pelvic floor (drawing in the perineum)
Uddiyana bandha, drawing back the abdomen approximately two inches below the navel
Jalandhara bandha, throat lock (achieved by lowering the chin slightly while raising the sternum).
Both Pattabhi Jois and Sharath Jois recommend practising mula and uddiyana bandha even when not practicing asanas. Pattabhi Jois explains: (translated quote) "You completely exhale, apply mula bandha and after inhaling you apply uddiyana bandha. Both bandhas are very important... After bandha practice, take [your attention] to the location where they are applied and maintain that attention at all times, while walking, talking, sleeping and when walk is finished. Always you control mula bandha".
Sharath Jois says: "Without bandhas, breathing will not be correct, and the asanas will give no benefit".
Opening chant
Ashtanga practice is traditionally started with the following Sanskrit invocation to Patanjali:
and closes with the "mangala mantra" (Lokaksema):
History
Pattabhi Jois claimed to have learned the system of ashtanga from Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who in turn claimed to have learned it from a supposed text called Yoga Kurunta by the otherwise unknown author Vamama Rishi. This text was imparted to Krishnamacharya in the early 1900s by their Guru, Yogeshwara Ramamohana Brahmachari. Jois insists that the text described all of the asanas and vinyasas of the sequences of the ashtanga system. However, the text is said to have been eaten by ants so it is impossible to verify their assertions. Additionally, it is unusual that the text is not mentioned as a source in either of the books by Krishnamacharya, Yoga Makaranda (1934) and Yogāsanagalu (c. 1941).
According to Manju Jois, the sequences of ashtanga yoga were created by Krishnamcharya. There is some evidence to support this in Yoga Makaranda, which lists nearly all the postures of the Pattabhi Jois primary series and several postures from the intermediate and advanced series, described with reference to vinyasa.
There is also evidence that the ashtanga yoga series incorporates exercises used by Indian wrestlers and British gymnasts. Recent academic research details documentary evidence that physical journals in the early 20th century were full of the postural shapes that were very similar to Krishnamacharya's asana system. In particular, the flowing surya namaskara, which later became the basis of Krishnamacharya's Mysore style, was in the 1930s considered as exercise and not part of yoga; the two styles were at that time taught separately, in adjacent halls of the Mysore palace.
Etymology
Jois elided any distinction between their sequences of asanas and the eight-limbed ashtanga yoga (Sanskrit अष्टांग asht-anga, "eight limbs") of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. The eight limbs of Patanjali's scheme are yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. It was Jois's belief that asana, the third limb, must be practiced first, and only after that could one master the other seven limbs. However, the name ashtanga in Jois's usage may, as yoga scholar Mark Singleton suggests, derive from the old name of surya namaskar in the system of dand gymnastic exercises, which was named ashtang dand after one of the original postures in the sequence, ashtanga namaskara (now replaced by chaturanga dandasana), in which eight body parts all touch the ground, rather than Patanjali's yoga.
Tradition
There has been much debate over the term "traditional" as applied to ashtanga yoga. The founder's students noted that Jois freely modified the sequence to suit the practitioner. Some of the differences include the addition or subtraction of postures in the sequences, changes to the vinyasa (full and half vinyasa), and specific practice prescriptions to specific people.
Several changes to the practice have been made since its inception. Nancy Gilgoff, an early student, describes many differences in the way they were taught ashtanga to the way it is taught now. According to their experiences, some of the differences include: Pattabhi Jois originally left out seven postures in the standing sequence, but later assigned utthita hasta padangusthasana and ardha baddha padmottanasana before the intermediate series was given; utkatasana, virabhadrasana A and B, parivritta trikonasana, and parivritta parsvakonasana were not in the series at this point; and Jois did not give a vinyasa between the same poses on the different sides of the body or between variations on a pose (e.g., janu sirsasana A, B, and C were done together, followed by a vinyasa. Likewise baddha konasana, upavishta konasana and supta konasana were also grouped together without a vinyasa between them, as were ubhaya padangusthasana and urdhva mukha paschimottanasana.
According to Gilgoff, Pattabhi Jois prescribed practising twice a day, primary and intermediate series, with no vinyasa between sides in krounchasana, bharadvajasana, ardha matsyendrasana, eka pada sirsasana, parighasana, and gomukhasana in the intermediate series. Shalabhasana to parsva dhanurasana were done in a group, with a vinyasa only performed at the end. Ushtrasana through kapotasana also were done altogether. The same went for eka pada sirsasana through yoganidrasana. The closing sequence included only mudrasana, padmasana, and tolasana, until the completion of the intermediate series when the remainder of the closing sequence was assigned. Urdhva dhanurasana and "drop-backs" were taught after the intermediate series. Gilgoff states that the original intermediate series included vrishchikasana after karandavasana and ended with gomukhasana. They also note that Pattabhi Jois added supta urdhva pada vajrasana as well as the seven headstands when another yogi asked for more; these eight postures were not part of the intermediate series prior to this.
Power yoga spinoffs
Power yoga began in the 1990s via a "nearly simultaneous invention" by two students of K. Pattabhi Jois and similar forms led by other yoga teachers.
Beryl Bender Birch created what Yoga Journal calls "the original power yoga" in 1995.
Bryan Kest, who studied ashtanga yoga under K. Pattabhi Jois, and Baron Baptiste, a Bikram yoga enthusiast, separately put their own spins on the style and provided its branding. Neither Baptiste's power yoga nor Kest's power yoga are synonymous with ashtanga yoga. In 1995, Pattabhi Jois wrote a letter to Yoga Journal expressing their disappointment at the association between their ashtanga yoga and the newly-coined power yoga, referring to it as "ignorant bodybuilding".
Risk of injury
In an article published by The Economist, it was reported that "a good number of Mr Jois's students seemed constantly to be limping around with injured knees or backs because they had received their "adjustments", yanking them into Lotus, the splits, or a backbend". Tim Miller, one of Jois's students, indicates that "the adjustments were fairly ferocious". Injuries related to Jois's ashtanga yoga have been the subject of discussion in a Huffington Post article.
In 2008, yoga researchers in Europe published a survey of practitioners of ashtanga yoga that indicated that 62 percent of respondents had suffered at least one injury that lasted longer than one month. However, the survey lacked a control group (of similar people not subject to the treatment, such as people who had practised a different form of yoga), which limited its validity.

Patrick Henry Village (PHV), was a United States Army family housing area located in the vicinity of Heidelberg, Germany, adjacent to and just south of the small town of Eppelheim. It opened in 1947 after World War II and was named after Patrick Henry, first and sixth Governor of Virginia.
PHV was at its height populated with up to 16,000 Americans. The housing area closed on 6 September 2013.
For the vast majority of its existence, PHV was not fenced, gated, or in any other way not completely open to entry and transit by the general public. After the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, fences were built around the living quarters so that no one could enter without an authorized U.S. government ID card. Also, the yearly German-American 'Volksfest' was moved to nearby Patton Barracks, for security reasons.
In 2002, the US Army planned a large extension of the housing area. However, soon afterwards the Army announced the closure of all Heidelberg and Mannheim facilities.
Patrick-Henry-Village was officially closed on September 6, 2013, after all military personnel were moved to the new headquarters of the United States European Command at Wiesbaden. On 2 June 2014, the site was transferred to the Institute for Federal Real Estate.
Former facilities
In its final state, Patrick Henry Village had a large number of educational, recreational and public facilities as well as shops and dining facilities. Schools included Patrick Henry Elementary School (Grades K-5) and Heidelberg Middle School (Grades 6-8), as well as a guest Canadian elementary/middle school (Grades K-8) for the children of Canadian military personnel. Recreational facilities included a gym, a bowling alley, a miniature golf course, a movie theater, tennis courts and baseball fields, the Heidelberg Non-Commissioned Officer's Club, aka "Old Dominion Club" and the Heidelberg Commissioned Officer's Club. Public services included a clinic for dentistry, a barbershop, a library, a post office, and a Roman Catholic and Protestant church.
Present usage
At the end of 2014, parts of the installation were used as an emergency shelter for refugees as a reaction to the refugee crisis. From summer 2015 on, the shelter was extended to the Bedarfsorientierte Erstaufnahmeeinrichtung Heidelberg in order to house and process asylum seekers according to the regular procedure with a capacity of ca. 4.000 persons (as of October 2015). The Minister of Science of Baden-Württemberg Theresia Bauer demanded the restoration of more buildings in PHV so that more refugees can be housed there, but Heidelberg's Deputy Mayor Eckart Würzner objected their request and insisted on decentralized accommodation within Heidelberg as well as on a fairer distribution of refugees in Baden-Württemberg. The federal government of Baden-Württemberg decided regardless that Patrick-Henry-Village should become the central processing hub for three-fourths of all refugees of the southwest. It was planned that refugees should pass 40 procedures there, which combine the identification, health check, registration and application for asylum. Furthermore, asylum applicants who were sent to the rural districts get cited to appear at Patrick Henry Village again for their asylum hearing to take place.

ItsTheReal, also known as Jeff and Eric Rosenthal, are two brothers from Harrison, New York, who have been active in the hip-hop music scene for over a decade.
Prior to ItsTheReal
Eric was Kanye West's videographer at the 2005 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, CA.
Jeff worked for the HBO and AOL comedy website ThisJustIn.com
Hip-Hop Sketch Comedy Videos
The Rosenthal brothers began self-releasing their weekly sketch videos in 2007 after an idea for a half-hour show based around interviews, sketch videos and live performances was turned down by multiple media companies. Their first video was titled "Deconstructing Biggie" and was featured on Complex, as one of the best viral videos of the 2000s, as well as Pigeons and Planes. Cameos on the program over the next three and a half years included Cam'ron, Max B, Slaughterhouse, Bun B, Clipse, Pete Wentz, Travie McCoy, Amanda Seales, Nick Cannon and more.
Podcasts
After spending more than 3 years working on sketch comedy, putting out videos almost every Monday, the duo moved into the realm of interviews, working for MTV. They joined forces with Jensen Karp to host the podcast "Hypemen" which ran from August 2010 until July 2011.
In May 2015, the brothers returned to podcasting through a deal with Sideshow Network. Their new podcast "A Waste of Time with ItsTheReal" would feature Eric and Jeff engaging in authentic and hilarious conversation with rappers, tastemakers, and industry veterans, all from their Upper West Side apartment. Guests have included Cardi B, Trevor Noah, Rick Ross, John Legend, Lil Uzi Vert, Wiz Khalifa, Jemele Hill, Mac Miller, Jerrod Carmichael, Rembert Browne, Angie Martinez, Director X, Swizz Beatz, and many more over their first 300 episodes. The Rosenthals worked with Fullscreen from June 2016 through November 2016 on simulcasting A Waste of Time with ItsTheReal on Fullscreen's new video platform.
In December 2016, the Rosenthals announced a new partnership for the podcast, moving to the Loud Speakers Network. ItsTheReal went independent in 2018.
In November 2017, ItsTheReal partnered with Styles P and Sheek Louch of The LOX on a new podcast called "2 Jews and 2 Black Dudes Review the Movies." Each episode is a dynamic conversation between two sets of best friends who all grew up ten minutes from each other, but under completely different circumstances; the discussions - based around viewings of movies like Coco, You've Got Mail, Trading Places, Jurassic Park, The Last Dragon, Home Alone, etc. - touch on deep, thoughtful and utterly ridiculous subject matter and bring up the most random and fascinating stories.
Music
Right before Election Day 2010, ItsTheReal released a song called "My Girl's a Republican," which gained notoriety from the clever one-shot music video, as well as for the Tea Party's opposition to it.
In 2013, the Rosenthals worked with DJ Drama and released their first mixtape, Urbane Outfitters. Urbane Outfitters featured the singles "Beef Wit Us" featuring Maino and "Girls With the Dirty Souths" featuring Bun B. Also on the mixtape: Lil Jon, Freeway and Hannibal Buress. The street single "Jews for Jesus Piece" hit the e-streets soon thereafter. The album resulted in the duo making the front page of the New York Times Arts section.
ItsTheReal released their second music project, the full-length Teddy Bear Fresh on May 26, 2017. The street singles "Dave Matthews Bands" and "Fire in a Crowded Room (Get the Hose)" featuring Michael Christmas were followed by "Waco." The album, which NYLON called "not only killer comedy, but also one of 2017's more complete and enjoyable rap records thus far," was produced by Greg Mayo and features appearances from Curren$y, Smoke DZA, Bun B, Tunji Ige, Jazz Cartier, Michael Christmas, Angie Martinez, Just Blaze, Combat Jack, Scott Rogowsky, and Sway Calloway.
Live Performances
ItsTheReal performed twice at the 2012 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival.
Eric and Jeff headlined their own concert at Gansevoort NYC on September 17, 2015, called The YOLONO Tour (You Only Live One Night Only) where their performed their own songs, told stories from their career, and brought out special guests like Bun B, Joell Ortiz, Bridget Kelly, DJ Clark Kent, Miss Info, MC Jin, Torae and Smoke DZA.
ItsTheReal sold out their headlining show at New York City's famed music venue SOB's, called "Your Girl's Tour," on February 23, 2017. OG Chase B served as the opening DJ, Just Blaze DJ'd during ItsTheReal's set, and Freeway performed as a special guest.
On July 26, 2017, ItsTheReal sold out Highline Ballroom in New York City, for a live podcast celebrating the legacy of Roc-A-Fella Records, bringing together Biggs, Hip-Hop, Lenny S, Chaka, Just Blaze, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Young Gunz and Freeway, all on one stage.
ItsTheReal made their international live event debut by interviewing acclaimed DJ Semtex in front of a sold-out crowd at London's Hoxton Sq. Bar & Kitchen on September 6, 2017. They have since performed in Los Angeles and returned to the SOB's stage in January 2018.
ItsTheReal played the 2018 Roots Picnic.
ItsTheReal returned to Highline Ballroom with The LOX on October 3, 2018, in the first live performance of 2 Jews and 2 Black Dudes Review the Movies. Jadakiss - a part-time co-host of the podcast - joined Eric, Jeff, Styles and Sheek in watching and debating the 1993 blockbuster movie Jurassic Park along with a packed house of movie fans, LOX fans and humor fans.
Television
Eric and Jeff sold a scripted TV show to MTV in October 2015.

A faulty generalization is an informal fallacy wherein a conclusion is drawn about all or many instances of a phenomenon on the basis of one or a few instances of that phenomenon. It is similar to a proof by example in mathematics. It is an example of jumping to conclusions. For example, one may generalize about all people or all members of a group, based on what one knows about just one or a few people:
If one meets a rude person from a given country X, one may suspect that most people in country X are rude.
If one sees only white swans, one may suspect that all swans are white.
Expressed in more precise philosophical language, a fallacy of defective induction is a conclusion that has been made on the basis of weak premises, or one which is not justified by sufficient or unbiased evidence. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions, yet only weakly buttress the conclusions, hence a faulty generalization is produced. The essence of this inductive fallacy lies on the overestimation of an argument based on insufficiently-large samples under an implied margin or error.
Logic
A faulty generalization often follows the following format:
The proportion Q of the sample has attributed A.
Therefore, the proportion Q of the population has attributed A.
Such a generalization proceeds from a premise about a sample (often unrepresentative or biased), to a conclusion about the population itself.
Faulty generalization is also a mode of thinking that takes the experiences of one person or one group, and incorrectly extends it to another.
Inductive fallacies
Hasty generalization is the fallacy of examining just one or very few examples or studying a single case and generalizing that to be representative of the whole class of objects or phenomena.
The opposite, slothful induction, is the fallacy of denying the logical conclusion of an inductive argument, dismissing an effect as "just a coincidence" when it is very likely not.
The overwhelming exception is related to the hasty generalization but works from the other end. It is a generalization that is accurate, but tags on a qualification that eliminates enough cases (as exceptions); that what remains are much less impressive than what the original statement might have led one to assume.
Fallacy of unrepresentative samples is a fallacy where a conclusion is drawn using samples that are unrepresentative or biased.
Misleading vividness is a kind of hasty generalization that appeals to the senses.
Statistical special pleading occurs when the interpretation of the relevant statistic is "massaged" by looking for ways to reclassify or requantify data from one portion of results, but not applying the same scrutiny to other categories.
This can be considered a special case of the fallacy of composition, where the item under discussion is a group, and the fallacy is what can be derived from knowledge of part of the item.
Hasty generalization
Hasty generalization is an informal fallacy of faulty generalization, which involves reaching an inductive generalization based on insufficient evidence—essentially making a rushed conclusion without considering all of the variables or enough evidence. In statistics, it may involve basing broad conclusions regarding a statistical survey from a small sample group that fails to sufficiently represent an entire population. Its opposite fallacy is called slothful induction, which consists of denying a reasonable conclusion of an inductive argument (e.g. "it was just a coincidence").
Examples
Hasty generalization usually follows the pattern:
X is true for A.
X is true for B.
Therefore, X is true for C, D, E, etc.
For example, if a person travels through a town for the first time and sees 10 people, all of them children, they may erroneously conclude that there are no adult residents in the town.
Alternatively, a person might look at a number line, and notice that the number 1 is a square number; 3 is a prime number, 5 is a prime number, and 7 is a prime number; 9 is a square number; 11 is a prime number, and 13 is a prime number. From these observations, the person might claim that all odd numbers are either prime or square, while in reality, 15 is an example that disproves the claim.
Alternative names
The fallacy is also known as:
Black Swan fallacy
Illicit generalization
Fallacy of insufficient sample
Generalization from the particular
Leaping to a conclusion
Blanket statement
Hasty induction
Law of small numbers
Unrepresentative sample
Secundum quid
When referring to a generalization made from a single example, the terms "fallacy of the lonely fact", or the "fallacy of proof by example", might be used.
When evidence is intentionally excluded to bias the result, the fallacy of exclusion—a form of selection bias—is said to be involved.

Robillard Glacier () is a narrow glacier flowing east-northeast and entering the north side of the head of Solberg Inlet, on the east coast of Graham Land. It was discovered by members of East Base of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS), 1939–41, and was photographed from the air in 1947 by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), under Ronne, and charted in 1948 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS). It was named by Ronne for Captain George Robillard, U.S. Navy, of the legal section of the Bureau of Ships, who assisted in gaining Congressional support which resulted in procuring the expedition ship.

The armadillo projection is a map projection used for world maps. It is neither conformal nor equal-area but instead affords a view evoking a perspective projection while showing most of the globe instead of the half or less that a perspective would. The projection was presented in 1943 by Erwin Raisz (1893–1968) as part of a series of "orthoapsidal" projections, which are perspectives of the globe projected onto various surfaces. This one in the series has the globe projected onto half a torus. Raisz singled it out and named it the "armadillo" projection.
The toroidal shape and the angle it is viewed from tend to emphasize continental areas by eliminating or foreshortening swaths of ocean. In the pure case of projecting the half-torus, New Zealand cannot be seen, as in the images here. However, in publications, the projection often develops a "pigtail" which shows the rest of Australia as well as New Zealand.
Raisz coined the term orthoapsidal as a combination of orthographic and apsidal. They used it to mean drawing a parallel-meridian network, or graticule, on any suitable solid other than a sphere, and then making an orthographic projection of that.
Formulas
Given a radius of sphere R, central meridian λ0 and a point with geographical latitude φ and longitude λ, plane coordinates x and y can be computed using the following formulas:
In this formulation, no latitude more southerly than φs should be plotted for the given longitude. The y-axis coincides with the central meridian.

Ibrahim Maalouf (, ; born 5 November 1980 in Beirut) is a French-Lebanese jazz trumpeter and composer.
Biography
Their father is trumpeter Nassim Maalouf and their mother is pianist Nada Maalouf. Their uncle is the writer Amin Maalouf and their grandfather was the journalist, poet, and musicologist Rushdi Maalouf.
After leaving their home country as a child during the Lebanese Civil War, they grew up in Paris with their sister Layla. They studied there until the age of 17 and earned a degree in General Science and Specialized Mathematics from the Lycée Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire in Étampes (Essonne).
When they were seven years old, they started to learn how to play the trumpet from their father, a former student of French trumpeter Maurice André at the Conservatoire de Paris. They learned classical, baroque, modern, and contemporary repertoires, as well as classical Arabic music and improvisation. Their father invented the microtonal trumpet or "quarter tone trumpet", which makes it possible to play Arabic maqams on the trumpet.
As a teenager Maalouf accompanied their father in a duo throughout Europe and the Middle East, playing a baroque repertoire by Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni, Henry Purcell, and Antonio Vivaldi. They performed a difficult classical piece, the Second Brandenburg Concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach. Maurice André advised them to give up science and pursue music instead. They took André's advice and spent five years at the Conservatoire de Paris. They recorded with Matthieu Chedid, Vincent Delerm, and Arthur H. They became a teacher at CNR d'Aubervilliers-La Courneuve and gave master classes in the U.S. Their first solo album was Diasporas (2007) on their label.
They have composed several movie soundtracks and several pieces for choirs and symphonic orchestras. They have worked with Sting, Salif Keita, Amadou & Mariam, Lhasa de Sela, Marcel Khalife, Vanessa Paradis, Juliette Gréco, and Archie Shepp. They teach improvisation at Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional de Paris (Paris Regional Superieur Conservatory).
Maalouf passed an open competition at the CNR de Paris (regional Conservatory) and joined the class of Gérard Boulanger for a two-year training course. After that, they passed another open competition and joined the Conservatoire de Paris in Antoine Curé's class for a three-year training course. They obtained degrees from both schools and entered national, European, and international trumpet competitions. They wrote more than 15 pieces for different ensembles from small to symphonic orchestras and choirs that were commissioned since 2005.
From 2006 to 2013, Maalouf was a trumpet instructor at the CNR of Aubervilliers, La Courneuve in France,
In 2000, Maalouf met producer Marc-Antoine Moreau, who introduced them to the cellist Vincent Segal. It was the beginning of a long and fruitful series of encounters. In November 2008, Maalouf played in the opera Welcome to the Voice at the Chatelet Theatre in Paris composed by Steve Nieve and directed by Muriel Teodori. Maalouf encountered on stage Elvis Costello, Sylvia Schwartz, and Sting, who played the lead role. Sting asked them to play on their album If on a Winter's Night...
Maalouf has composed music since they were very young. They presented their compositions for the first time in 1999. Their first group Farah had an Oriental jazz flavor because they were accompanied by a saxophone, a ney (Middle-Eastern end-blown flute), a transverse flute, a piano, a double bass, a guitar, a buzuq (a long-necked fretted lute related to the Greek bouzouki) and Arabic percussion. A concert recording by this group was broadcast on several music channels between 2004 and 2005.
In 2004, their encounter with Lhasa de Sela opened the doors of electronic music to him. Their collaboration with pop and rock singers made them discover other musical styles apart from jazz, classical, and Arabic music. Their compositions began to reflect a more contemporary style. In 2006, they met Alejandra Norambuena Skira (from the SACEM's Action Fund), who introduced them to Jean-Louis Perrier. Perrier helped them to form the band with whom they gave a concert on February 12, 2006 at the Paris New Morning Jazz Club.
Their music and their trumpet playing are inspired by their Arabic culture, but the surrounding instruments (bass, electric guitar, drums, Arabic percussion, vibraphone) and the musicians with whom they perform give a rock, electronic, and jazz funk flavor to their music.
Maalouf gets a lot of their inspiration from their culture of origin. This subject has been explored in the documentary Souffle! (Blow), directed by Christophe Trahand and produced by Cocottes Minutes between 2005 and 2006. Christophe Trahand followed Ibrahim for several months pursuing the key to their inspiration and to explore their relationship with their native country and the distance that separates them from it. This documentary was broadcast by TV5 MONDE and is available on DVD in the collection Docnet Films.
Awards
Between 1999 and 2003, Maalouf earned awards in fifteen competitions throughout the world. These include first prize in the Hungarian International Trumpet Competition in Pilisvörösvár in May 2002, first prize in the National Trumpet Competition (Washington D.C.) in 2001, and second prize (ex aequo) in the Maurice André International Competition in Paris in 2003. In July 2010, they were given the Instrumental Revelation of the Year at the French Jazz Music Awards (Victoires du Jazz). They won Best World Music Artist at the French Music Awards in 2014.

James Yardley (16 April 1903 – 1959) was a Scottish professional footballer, best known as a player for Luton Town.
Playing career
Yardley signed for Luton Town from Clapton Orient during the 1926–27 season, but failed to score before the season ended. During 1927–28, their first full season with the club, Yardley scored 23 league goals. They continued their good form the next season, scoring 19. They continued their good form until 1932, when they were surprisingly sold to Charlton Athletic.
In 1936, now well into their 30s, they returned to Scotland where they scored 38 top flight Scottish Football League goals over three seasons with Third Lanark and Ayr United, and was selected for the Glasgow FA's annual challenge match against Sheffield in November 1936. They moved on to Morton, but the outbreak of World War II a short time later brought their career to an end.

Susan Sophia Cavendish (wife of Thomas Trevor, 22nd Baron Dacre) and Hon. Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish (second wife of George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford).
Their father was the fourth son of George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington (himself the third son of former Prime Minister William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire) and Lady Elizabeth Compton (only child of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton). Their maternal grandparents were George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly and the former Catherine Cope (second daughter and co-heiress of Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet).
They were educated at Eton College.
Career
From 1833 to 1840, Cavendish was an Officer in the 10th Light Dragoons. Their father commissioned famous architect Edward Blore to build a new family home, known as Latimer House, which was completed in 1838.

William Lascelles (third son of Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood) and their wife Lady Caroline Georgiana Howard (a daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle). Together, they were the parents of:
Charles Compton William Cavendish, 3rd Baron Chesham (1850–1907), who married Lady Beatrice Constance Grosvenor, second daughter of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster and Lady Constance Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (fourth daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland). After their death, they married Maj. John Alexander Moncrieffe in 1910.
Hon. Georgiana Caroline Cavendish (1852–1937), who married, as their second wife, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, in 1875.
Hon. Mary Susan Caroline Cavendish (1853–1937), who married Charles Lyttelton, 8th Viscount Cobham, in 1878.
Hon. Katherine Caroline Cavendish (1857–1941), who married, as their second wife, Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, in 1882.
Hon. William Edwin Cavendish (1862–1931), who married Elizabeth Janet Baillie, sister of Sir George Baillie, 3rd Baronet, in 1885.
Lord Chesham died in June 1882, aged 66, at Latimer House, Latimer, Buckinghamshire. They were succeeded in the barony by their eldest son Charles. Their widow died nearly two years later on 21 May 1884.

Melktert (, Afrikaans for milk tart) is a South African dessert originally created by the Dutch settlers in the "Cape" (South Africa) consisting of a sweet pastry crust containing a custard filling made from milk, flour, sugar and eggs. The ratio of milk to eggs is higher than in a traditional Portuguese custard tart or Chinese egg tart, resulting in a lighter texture and a stronger milk flavour.
The dessert originated among settlers at the Dutch Cape Colony in the 17th century, and is believed to have developed from the Dutch mattentaart, a cheesecake-like dessert which was included in the cookbook Een Notabel Boexcken Van Cokeryen (A Notable Book of Cookery) published by Thomas van der Noot around 1514. Some recipes require that the custard be baked in the crust, while others call for the custard to be prepared in advance, and then placed in the crust before serving. Cinnamon is often sprinkled over its surface, and the milk used for the custard may also be infused with a cinnamon stick before preparation. A staple at church fetes and home industries, and commonplace in South African supermarkets, melktert may be served chilled or at room temperature, or slightly warmed.

The Monocled Mutineer is a 1986 BBC television drama series starring Paul McGann about the Étaples mutiny in 1917 during the First World War. The four-part serial, which was the first historical screenplay written by Alan Bleasdale, dramatised the life of British Army deserter Percy Toplis. It was adapted from the 1978 book of the same name by William Allison and John Fairley.
After ten million people watched the first episode, British right-wing media vilified the series as an example of left-wing bias at the BBC. The series was produced and broadcast at a time the Peacock Committee was deciding the future of the BBC (there was renewed pressure for the public broadcaster to use advertising). At the same time, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, was monitoring the BBC for evidence of "left-wing bias". Legal action was brought against the BBC over the Panorama programme "Maggie's Militant Tendency", which caused 100 Conservative MPs to sign a motion calling for the resignation of Director General Alasdair Milne and "the restoration of proper standards at the BBC".
The BBC was criticised for marketing The Monocled Mutineer as a true story when in fact it was dramatisation of historical events. One of the series' advisors Julian Putkowski, a WWI military historian, distanced themselves from the completed production citing the real Percy Toplis was never involved in the mutinies at Étaples, France.
Synopsis
In 1917 Percy Toplis arrives at Étaples, the main depot and transit camp of the British Expeditionary Force in France. Instead of being a rest and recuperation area, weary troops are put through rigorous training drills in the "Bull Ring" overseen by brutal NCOs known as "Canaries" (because of the yellow sash they wear on their caps). The inhuman conditions begin to deeply affect the British, New Zealand and Australian troops staying in the camp but their protests are rebuffed. A group mutineer, including Toplis, take weapons from the camp arsenal, attack the NCOs and make their demands directly to the camp commander, General Thomson. Toplis begins wearing an officer's uniform and a monocle. After a three-day stand-off, the camp is retaken and the mutiny ringleaders are executed. Toplis switches disguises and returns to London where they meet Dorothy. They live together for three years before they rejoin the Army under an assumed name in 1920. After they are recognised by someone who was at Étaples, they desert again. Due to the ignominy the British government feels about the wartime mutiny, a Special Branch officer is assigned to the hunt. Toplis is killed by the officer. The matter at Étaples is judged closed.

Production
The BBC had originally approached Bleasdale in 1981 to adapt William Allison and John Fairley's 1978 book The Monocled Mutineer, which had at the time of its publication prompted questions in Parliament about the events of the Étaples mutiny, which led to the discovery that all records of the Étaples Board of Enquiry had been destroyed long ago. However, Bleasdale had at the time turned it down saying, "I don't do adaptations." They eventually changed their mind, finding some personal resonances in the story. As they commented: "My grandfather died on the Western Front six months before my father was born, and I found that a great pull to the story ..."
Reception
On 9 September The Daily Telegraphs Defence Correspondent John Keegan criticised The Monocled Mutineer. They said: "The Étaples 'mutinies' amounted to no more than a few days of disorder, a little disrespect to officers and some loudly-voiced demands for humane treatment. The army reacted briskly. It restored discipline by bringing in unaffected troops. It removed the cause of discontent by replacing the worst of the staff with wise men. That is about all there was to the British Army 'mutinies' of the 1914–1918 war."
As a direct result of the mutiny, only a few individuals were punished. Corporal Jesse Robert Short (Northumberland Fusiliers) was condemned to death and shot by a firing squad; three other soldiers were sentenced to 10 years' penal servitude and others were jailed for up to a year's imprisonment with hard labour.
Keegan's piece was followed on 12 September by a statement to the press by Julian Putkowski, who had acted as a historical advisor to the series. They claimed that the serial was "riddled with error" and The Daily Telegraph reported that "He accused the producer of ignoring their advice ... Mr Putkowski disclaimed all responsibility for what they say are factual errors and misinterpretations in the series. They accused the BBC of failing to consult them on the final version of the script and described the book by William Allison and John Fairley, on which the series is based, as 'a sensational version of the mutiny and Toplis' life.'"
In response to this, series producer Richard Broke admitted that there had been "small examples of dramatic licence [taken]", and went on to point out that "Mr Putkowski did not point out to us at any stage that Percy Toplis was not at Étaples Camp and they never challenged the book they knew we were working from." The BBC's Managing Director of Television, Bill Cotton, further defended the series on the basis that it expressed "the greater truth about World War I". The BBC's official line was that the series is a drama, not a documentary and made no pretence at being a precise historical record. However, the damage had been done thanks to their original press campaign which had called The Monocled Mutineer a "true-life story"; Alasdair Milne blamed this on their advertising agency.
Awards and nominations
The BAFTA (1987) awarded to composer George Fenton for "Best Original Television Music" (the series also received 9 other BAFTA nominations)
Home media releases
The series was released as a VHS double box set in 1999 and then as a DVD in 2007.

Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery is a small panel painting in grisaille (near monochrome) by the Netherlandish Renaissance printmaker and painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It is signed and dated 1565.
Jesus and the woman taken in adultery is a biblical episode from where Jesus encounters an adulteress brought before Pharisees and scribes, which has been depicted by many artists. Such a crime was punishable by death by stoning, however, in the scene, Jesus stoops to write (in Dutch) "he that is without sin among you, let them first cast the stone at her" on the ground before their feet. A number of the unthrown stones lie on the floor to the left of the woman.
Bruegel depicts the woman as one of the few graceful figures in the scene.  They are rendered as an idealised form, atypical of Brugel's usual earthy and homely female figures; though the basic layout of the composition is Netherlandish, "the austere composition and monumental figures are perhaps the most Italianate in all Bruegel's paintings". Apart from an even smaller Three Soldiers in the Frick Collection, Bruegel's only other surviving grisaille painting is the Death of the Virgin at Upton House, Warwickshire, which is also an unusually conventional treatment of a religious subject by Bruegel's standards. However, the earliest documented work by Bruegel was grisaille wings for an altarpiece in 1550/51, as they finished their apprenticeship. This was in Mechelen, where they are documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting Peeter Baltens on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings.
The painting was not sold by the artist, and seems to be the only one inherited by their son Jan Brueghel the Elder. An engraving was published in 1579 by Paul Perret, who was apparently lent the painting for the purpose, since there are regular pricks along the edges to enable a grid to be made. There are a number of other copies, some attributed to the artist's sons, perhaps made after the engraving, and the painting was lent to Cardinal Federico Borromeo for copying (perhaps the version now in Bergamo). A version attributed to Breuegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger of c. 1600 is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The work was sold by the family in the 17th century, apparently by Jan Brueghel the Younger, and was in England by the 18th century, being sold at Christie's in 1834 and again in 1952 when it was bought by Count Antoine Seilern, whose collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld in 1978. The work was stolen from the Courtauld Gallery on 2 February 1982. Because of its value and fame, it proved unsaleable on the open market, and did not resurface again until 1992 when it was recovered by British police. During that interim, it likely acted as collateral for the criminals.

A Marine Protected Area Network or MPA network is a network of Marine Protected Areas or Marine Reserves.
A Marine Protected Area Network can be defined as "a collection of individual MPAs or reserves operating cooperatively and synergistically, at various spatial scales, and with a range of protection levels that are designed to meet objectives that a single reserve cannot achieve". Such a network can include several MPAs of different sizes, located in critical habitats, containing components of a particular habitat type or portions of different kinds of important habitats, and interconnected by the movement of animals and plant propagules.
A Marine Protected Area Network is usually established to improve fish catch, to conserve biodiversity, or for a combination of these two reasons. They are usually placed so that larvae can migrate from MPAs to other, more impacted areas. It provides a framework that unifies the central aims of conservation and fishery management, while also meeting other human needs such as maintenance of coastal water quality, shoreline protection, education, research and recreational opportunities.
MPA networks have been defined as "A group of MPAs that interact with one another ecologically and/or socially form a network".
These networks are intended to connect individuals and MPAs and promote education and cooperation among various administrations and user groups. "MPA networks are, from the perspective of resource users, intended to address both environmental and socio-economic needs, complementary ecological and social goals and designs need greater research and policy support".
Filipino communities connect with one another to share information about MPAs, creating a larger network through the social communities' support. Emerging or established MPA networks can be found in Australia, Belize, the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Mexico.
In Scotland, the Scottish Marine Protected Area Network covers approximately 22 % of Scotland's seas. It consists of 231 sites protected by a variety of different conservation designations, many of which are the same as those used on land, such as Special Protection Areas (SPA) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). In addition to the statutory MPAs, five further sites are recognised as forming part of the Scottish MPA network, being categorised as "other area based measures": such areas, although not specifically created for nature conservation purposes, are considered to contribute to the protection of marine biodiversity.

Dark adaptor goggles, also called red adaptation goggles, are used in the field of meteorology and astronomy for adapting the eyes to the dark prior to an observation at night. They also aid with the identification of clouds during bright sunshine or glare from snow. The goggles are made with red-tinted plastic lenses. Such goggles or glasses are often used by pilots and weather observers to preserve their natural night vision.
To help with the identification of clouds during the day, the goggles should be put on just before the observer goes outside. This will ensure the eyes are not affected by the glare from the sun or snow. For use at night, the observer should put the goggles on about ten minutes prior to going outside. Once the observer is outside and away from major sources of light, the goggles may be removed and the observer's vision should be adapted to the dark. Although the goggles are designed to be worn indoors, some people find walking around inside, especially up and down stairs, to be difficult.
At no time should the goggles be used to help assess the visibility.
Concept
Dark adaptor goggles were invented by Wilhelm Trendelenburg in 1916.
The concept is based on the work by Antoine Béclère on dark adaptation of the eye, where it is noted that fluoroscopy relies on the use of the retinal rods of the eye.
Since retinal rods are insensitive to long wavelengths of light, such as red light, while retinal cones are not, the goggles enabled the physicians to adapt their eyes in preparation for the fluoroscopic procedure while still being able to perform other work. Prior to the invention of these goggles, physicians were required to sit in the darkened room where the procedure would be performed for extended periods to adapt their eyes to the low lighting conditions.

Galtee More (1894–1917) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a career that lasted from 1896 to 1897 they ran thirteen times and won eleven races. As a three-year-old in 1897 they became the seventh horse to win the English Triple Crown by winning the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Derby at Epsom and the St Leger at Doncaster. At the end of the season they were sold to the Russian government and went on to have a successful stud career in Russia and Germany. They died following an accident in 1917.
Background
Galtee More, a big bay horse of “almost faultless conformation” was bred by their owner John Gubbins at their Knockany Stud near Bruree, County Limerick. Their sire Kendal had been a leading two-year-old in 1885 before their racing career was ended by injury. They went on to become a leading sire in both Britain and Argentina: thanks to Galtee More's exploits they were British Champion Sire in 1897. Galtee More's dam, Morganette, was of little use as a racehorse but became an outstanding broodmare, producing a second Derby winner in Ard Patrick. Gubbins named the colt after Galtymore (Cnoc Mór na nGaibhlte), a mountain on the border of Limerick and County Tipperary.
Galtee More was sent to England to be trained by Sam Darling at Beckhampton, Wiltshire. They were ridden in their Triple Crown races by Charles Wood who won the Championship in 1887. Wood was a controversial figure who was “warned off” (banned from racing) for almost nine years before returning to partner Galtee More. After their successes in 1897, Wood was asked to explain what things were needed to win a Derby: they replied, "a saddle, a bridle and a good horse."
Racing career
1896: two-year-old season
Galtee More made their debut in July when they beat the odds-on favourite Minstrel in the Hurstbourne Stakes at Stockbridge. On their next start they suffered their only defeat as a two-year-old when they dead heated with Glencally (who was receiving eight pounds) for second place, a short head behind Brigg (receiving two pounds) in the Lancashire Breeders' Stakes at Liverpool. They won the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood before the end of July and was then given a break before the Rous Plate at Doncaster on 10 September. In the latter race they impressed observers with their appearance and performance in giving twelve pounds to Peacock and winning by one and a half lengths.
Galtee More was then sent to Newmarket for the year's most important two-year-old race, the six furlong Middle Park Plate in which they were matched against Lord Rosebery's undefeated colt Velasquez. The two colts had already been identified as outstanding prospects and leading contenders for the following year's Classics, and despite the presence of three other runners, the race was regarded as a virtual match, Velasquez starting the 1/5 favourite with Galtee More on 5/1. Ridden by Mornington Cannon, Galtee More led from the start and pulled clear to win easily, beating Velasquez by six lengths. The winner impressed observers with their "substance and strength", while the only excuse offered for Velasquez was that they had been unable to cope with the very soft, muddy conditions. At the end of the year, Galtee More and Velasquez were joint favourites, on 3/1 for the 1897 Derby.
1897: three-year-old season
2000 Guineas
Before the season began, Gubbins reportedly turned down an offer for their colt and said that £20,000 was the minimum sum they would consider. The 2000 Guineas on 5 May saw the rematch between Galtee More and Velasquez over one mile on good ground. Galtee More started 5/4 favourite for the race against seven rivals, with Velasquez on 6/4. Charles Wood tracked the leaders in the early stages as a fast pace was set by Arkle and Wreath Or. Velasquez looked to be the likely winner a quarter mile from the finish, but Galtee More accelerated past them "as if they were standing still" and drew rapidly clear to win by four lengths. After the race Gubbins turned down another offer for the colt, this time one of $125,000 from the "Montana Copper King" Marcus Daly. They followed up in the Newmarket Stakes on 19 May, in which they survived being baulked by Frisson before "sailing away" to win by two lengths. According to The Sportsman they decided the contest in two strides and won with such "incredible ease" that it could hardly be called a race.
Epsom Derby
The "Jubilee Derby" was run on a fine day in front of an "immense" crowd at Epsom on 2 June. Galtee More was considered virtually unbeatable and started at odds of 1/4, the second shortest in the race's history: Velasquez was 10/1 second favourite, with the other eight runners starting at 25/1 or more. Gubbins' instructions to Charles Wood were simple: "Don't be afraid of the corner, and come home as soon as you can." Wood settled the colt in the early stages as the running was made by Prime Minister and the Prince of Wales's colt Oakdene. Early in the straight Galtee More and Velasquez moved past Oakdene and from then on the race was a match between them. Wood established a clear advantage on Galtee More and, although Velasquez ran on "bravely", the favourite won "in a canter" by two lengths with History a further eight lengths away in third. After the race the winner was surrounded by enthusiastic supporters, but reacted calmly, even when one spectator began pulling out hairs from their tail as souvenirs. In Ireland, the colt's win provoked enthusiastic celebrations with bonfires being lit on the top of Galtymore mountain to mark the "humiliation of the Saxon".
Galtee More was then sent to Royal Ascot for the Prince of Wales's Stakes in which they started at odds of 1/33 and won in the "commonest of canters" from three rivals who were each receiving sixteen pounds. They then took the Sandringham Gold Cup at Sandown, winning a prize of £1,180 by beating Cortegar, the only horse to oppose him. Some disappointment was expressed around this time that there seemed little chance of a meeting between Galtee More and the outstanding four-year-old Persimmon who had easily beaten Velasquez in the Eclipse Stakes,.
St Leger
Galtee More was instead sent to Doncaster to attempt to complete the Triple Crown in the St Leger on 8 September. Only four horses opposed them and Galtee More started at odds of 1/10. The early pace was slow, and Wood tracked the leaders before moving to the front on the turn into the straight. On this occasion however, they were apparently unable to pull clear of their rivals and was strongly challenged in the closing stages by the filly Chelandry, the winner of the 1000 Guineas. The winning margin was only half a length, with St Cloud and Silver Fox only a neck and a head further back, but Wood claimed that the colt was never extended. Some commentators felt that the slow early pace had led to a "false-run" race which had prevented Galtee More from producing their best form.
After the St Leger, the managers of Lingfield Park Racecourse put forward a proposal for a £3,700 weight-for-age invitation match race between Galtee More and Persimmon to take place over one mile on 2 October. The invitations were not accepted and Persimmon was retired without running again. On their final start Galtee More was sent to Newmarket for the Cambridgeshire Handicap. Entered against older horses, they were assigned a weight of 130 pounds, the highest ever given to a three-year-old, requiring them to give weight to all their rivals except the seven-year-old Clorane (136) and the five-year-old Winkfield's Pride (132). Galtee More was prepared for their Cambridgeshire challenge by running in the Sandown Park Foal Stakes. They started at odds of 8/100 and despite running in a "lazy" fashion they won with "plenty to spare" by three lengths from Cortegar and five others. Both Clorane and Winkfield's Pride were withdrawn from the Cambridgeshire, leaving Galtee More to carry top weight in a field of twenty. They started 9/2 favourite despite giving thirty-two pounds to St Cloud, who had finished a length behind them at level weights in the St Leger. They were in touch with the pace until the final quarter mile, but faded in the closing stages to finish tenth behind Comfrey, to whom they were conceding thirty-four ponds.
In October there had been widespread reports of their sale to the Hungarian government, but these proved to be inaccurate. Early the following year Gubbins sold the colt to the Russian government for £25,000 and Galtee More was exported to Russia. Negotiations had been difficult, reportedly because of the unpredictable behaviour of the Russian representative General Arapoff.
Assessment and earnings
Galtee More was by far the biggest money winner of 1897. They topped the list of earners with £22,637, almost £10,000 clear of Persimmon. They had previously earned £4,382 as a two-year-old.
Stud career
Galtee More proved to be a success in at stud, siring the winners of many important races in Russia, Hungary and Poland. In 1904 they were sold to the German government for £14,000 and relocated to Graditz. They continued to sire good winners at their new base, being the Leading sire in Germany in 1910. On Jan 30 they were being loaded aboard a train for a journey to the Union Stud in Hoppegarten when they slipped and trapped their hind legs. They were returned to the stud on a sledge, but a veterinary examination revealed that they had suffered an untreatable fracture to the upper part of their leg. They were euthanized the same evening at the age of twenty-three.
Pedigree
* Galtee More was inbred 3 × 4 to the stallion Thormanby. This means that the 1859 Derby winner appears in both the third and fourth generations of their pedigree.

William Pickles (died September 9, 1783) was an officer of the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War.
Commissioned on October 10, 1776, they were active on the Gulf Coast. They were given command of , a British ship that had been captured on the Mississippi River, in 1779, but they were destroyed by a hurricane. They were then given another ship, also called , by Bernardo de Gálvez, the governor of Spanish Louisiana, to deal with British military shipping on Lake Pontchartrain. In September 1779 they captured a British ship. They then took over command of the prize, HMS West Florida, with instructions from Oliver Pollock, Congress' agent in New Orleans, to assist Gálvez in a planned expedition to capture the West Florida port of Mobile. The ship was re-rigged and renamed . Following that successful expedition, they sailed on to Philadelphia, where the ship was sold.
Pickles was then given command of , and charged with transporting Henry Laurens to the Dutch Republic on a diplomatic mission. The ship was captured off the coast of Newfoundland, and while Laurens were imprisoned in London, Pickles was imprisoned in Mill Prison in Plymouth. Pickles escaped from Mill on May 16, 1781 and eventually returned to Philadelphia. They died in Philadelphia on September 9, 1783, after being assaulted by a gang of Italian sailors.
The prosecution of their murderers was complicated by a legal question: whether statutes previously enacted by the British Parliament were still in force in the now independent state of Pennsylvania. Two of the sailors were sentenced on October 8, 1783, to hang ten days later.

Me'asha ben Joseph (?) was an aggadist and mystic; grandson and pupil of Joshua ben Levi From the few details concerning them it appears that on Shabbat they used to have themselves carried to the synagogue in order to preach, that they were not rich, and that they died suddenly in the time of Rabbi Ammi. Me'asha is particularly noted for the vision which they are reported to have seen during a trance lasting three days, and concerning which they said: "I have been in a world of confusion where people who are honored here are held in contempt". In Pesach 50a this vision is ascribed to Joseph ben Joshua ben Levi; Joseph was probably Me'asha's father. Me'asha inferred from Isaiah 33:15-17 that when one shuts their eyes to things indecent they are worthy to view the face of the Shekhinah.

The La Chaux-de-Fonds–Les Ponts-de-Martel railway is a metre-gauge railway in the Swiss Jura. It is operated by the Transports publics Neuchâtelois and has connected the municipalities of Les Ponts-de-Martel and La Sagne in the Vallée des Ponts (also called the Vallée de la Sagne) with La Chaux-de-Fonds since 26 July 1889.
History
Ownership of the line has changed several times over its history. It was built in 1889 by the (PSC). The PSC merged with the in 1947 to form the (CMN). The CMN, in turn, was one of several companies that merged in 1999 to form the (TRN). The TRN merged with the Compagnie des Transports en commun de Neuchâtel et environs in 2012 to form the Transports publics Neuchâtelois, the current operator.
Route
The railway was built by the Ponts–Sagne–Chaux-de-Fonds Railway (French legal name: Chemin de fer Régional La Chaux-de-Fonds - Les Ponts-de-Martel, PSC) as a metre-gauge line and is just over 16 kilometres long. It has one track and train crossings are now only possible in La Sagne. Since 28 November 1893, it has connected in La Chaux-de-Fonds at a common station with the also metre-gauge Saignelégier–La Chaux-de-Fonds railway (SC), which since 1 January 1944 has been part of the Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ).
The line leaves La Chaux-de-Fonds station (at 994 metres above sea level) on a steep gradient of 4.0 percent and reaches its high point of 1120 metres after passing through a tunnel in Reymond. From there, the line initially descends at 3.1 percent into the high valley. At the foot of a spur that it has just crossed, the line runs in an almost straight line to La Sagne and from there with a descent of only 1.6 percent to Les Ponts-de-Martel, including a short climb of 1.0 percent. There is a local depot in Les Ponts-de-Martel formed of several sidings.
In May 1915, the Saignelégier–La Chaux-de-Fonds Railway opened a transporter wagon yard in La Chaux-de-Fonds. The same transporter wagon system was also shared by the Chemins de fer des Montagnes Neuchâteloises from 1966, which began the transport of standard-gauge railway wagons on the line to Les Ponts-de-Martel. However, the CMN phased out all freight traffic. The transporter wagon yard was also used by the CJ for several years but it no longer exists.
Connecting lines
The standard-gauge station in La Chaux-de-Fonds was opened on 2 July 1857 and was the temporary terminus of the line to Le Locle, which was opened by the Compagnie Jura industriel (JI). The continuation to Convers was opened by the same company on 27 November 1859 and provided a connection to Neuchâtel until mid-1860, while the line to Biel/Bienne was opened by the Jura bernois (JB) in mid-1874. On 17 December 1888, the Jura–Bern–Luzern (JBL) company opened the direct line from Biel to La Chaux-de-Fonds through the Crosettes tunnel and the Renan–Le Convers connection was closed in 1895.

St. Josephs Industrial School, Artane was an Industrial School run by the Christian Brothers in Artane, Dublin from 1870 to 1969.
History
On 28 July 1870, the Artane Industrial School for Roman Catholic Boys, also known as St Joseph's, was officially certified to receive boys up to the age of 14 committed by magistrates for matters such as destitution, neglect, truancy and minor offences. The school was opened at the former site of Artane Castle on fifty six acres of land. Dormitories accommodated up to 150 boys. The dining area or refectory accommodated all 825 boys at one sitting. The facility comprised the School, the trade shops and the farm, in addition to the Community house.
Artane reached its peak enrollment of 830 in 1948, when numbers began to decline. Courts sent boys to Artane for reasons of inadequate parental care, destitution, neglect, truancy or the commission of minor offences. Adoption, fostering and boarding-out led to a decline in the number of children who would otherwise have entered the industrial schools. Artane was the largest industrial school, making it the most affected by these developments.
Cussen Commission
In 1936 the Cussen Commission inquiry into reformatories and industrial schools concluded that the school was too large and recommended that it be split into four schools. There is no indication of any follow-up on this recommendation by either the Congregation or the Department of Education. The commission was also critical of the level of education provided and the adequacy of aftercare for boys after they left school.
The Brothers had originally planned to close St. Joseph's on 31 August 1968, but action was deferred twice in order to give the Department of Education time to arrange alternative accommodation for the boys. The Institution closed on 30 June 1969. The main building is now used by St. David's CBS, while the School's refectory houses the Artane band.
Band
The school formed the Artane Boys Band in 1872, which first played in public in 1874. It became associated with the Gaelic Athletic Association and played before big matches in Croke Park. After the industrial school's closure the band continued under a community-run Artane School of Music. In 2004, after girls were admitted, the band's name was changed to the "Artane Band".
Child abuse
The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse found that Artane was under-staffed by a small number of largely inexperienced and untrained Brothers. As a result of complaints, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse investigated allegations of physical abuse, child sexual abuse, and neglect at Artane. The school "used frequent and severe corporal punishment", which was "systemic and pervasive", and that even when a child behaved it was still possible for them to be beaten. Sexual abuse of children by members of the Christian Brothers was "a chronic problem", that was at least one Brother during a 33-year period was a sexual abuser, that there were at least two such abusers for more than one third of those years and that for one year in the 1940s there were at least seven such abusers. Abuse by Christian Brothers was treated as a threat to the reputation of the order, inadvertently protecting abusers. The most common reaction to abuse being reported was to move the offender to another institution run by the same order. Frequently abuse was not investigated nor was it reported to the Garda Síochána nor to the Department of Education. Exploitation of smaller pupils at the school by older ones was also significant. Mealtimes were poorly supervised, leading to smaller pupils being bullied and the facilities for serving food were primitive. Clothing was poor quality, institutional and patched, despite criticism by the Departmental Inspector and there being a surplus in school accounts. Toilet facilities were primitive before 1953 and accommodation was poor.

Redhead Kingpin and the F.B.I. was an American hip hop/new jack swing group best known for its debut single and highest-charting song, "Do the Right Thing" from its album A Shade of Red, which peaked at No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1989. The song was featured on the soundtrack of Wes Craven's horror film The People Under the Stairs.
Career
The group was led by emcee David "Redhead" Guppy (an actual redhead), who also played keyboards. The F.B.I. consisted of Joseph "D.J. Wildstyle" Mann, Bo Roc, Lt. Squeak, Buzz, and Poochie.
A Shade of Red contained two other singles, "Pump It, Hottie", which reached No. 2 on the US Hot Rap Singles Chart in 1990, and "We Rock the Mic Right". The album was produced by Redhead and Markell Riley from the duo Wreckx-N-Effect (the younger brother of producer Teddy Riley) and was heavily influenced by the new jack swing trend at the time.
In 1991, the group released its second and final album, The Album with No Name. Recorded at Hillside Studios, Englewood, New Jersey, and Soundtracks Studios, New York, The Album with No Name peaked at No. 182 on the Billboard 200, while the song "3-2-1 Pump" reached No. 52 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The group also appeared on a track of the soundtrack of the 1991 film New Jack City. That same year, Guppy made their acting debut in the film Strictly Business, which also starred Halle Berry.
In 1992, Guppy co-wrote the song "Two Can Play That Game", which was recorded by Bobby Brown on their album, Bobby.
In 1993, Redhead Kingpin returned with Gicci Brown, D.J. Wildstyle, and Knowledge to form a new group called Private Investigators. Private Investigators had a harder-edged hip hop sound, and released one album titled React Like Ya Knew on Virgin/EMI.
In 2000, Redhead Kingpin produced a track on the Nutty Professor II: The Klumps soundtrack entitled "No (You Didn't Say)" by Kandice Love.
In 2006, Redhead Kingpin was featured on the Nas single "Where Are They Now."

The company was established as Lend Lease by Dick Dusseldorp in 1958 to provide finance for building contracts being undertaken by Civil & Civic. In 1961 the company acquired Civil & Civic from Bredero's Bouwbedrijf.
In 1970 Lend Lease expanded their operations into America, and in 1983 Lend Lease created 'The Lend Lease Foundation', their charitable arm to improve communication with and help in communities, as well as caring for both community and employee well-being.
In 1999 the company formed Actus Lend Lease with the acquisition of Actus Corporation's MILCON and technical service construction management business, and augmented this business with professionals from Lend Lease Design and Lend Lease Development.
Also in 1999 the company acquired Bovis from P&O, which now forms Lend Lease Project Management & Construction. Then in 2000 it bought Amresco's commercial mortgage business In 2001, Lend Lease acquired Delfin Property Group (now Lend Lease Communities) for $172 million. It went on to buy Crosby Homes (now Lend Lease Residential Development) for circa £240 million in 2005.
In 2009, former CEO and managing director, Steve McCann, was appointed.
In 2009, Lend Lease Corporation acquired Babcock and Brown Communities, rebranding the business as Lend Lease Primelife. At the time, this acquisition made Lend Lease Australia's largest provider of retirement villages.
In 2010, Lend Lease announced their first foray into the consumer market with Lend Lease Solar. The subsidiary was wound up in early 2011, with no explanation as to why the division had closed.
As of 17 Feb 2011 Lend Lease announced wider ranging changes to its group of brands. This announcement means the retirement of the Bovis, Delfin, Vivas, Catalyst and Primelife brands which will now referred to using the unified Lend Lease brand.
In late February 2011, Lend Lease acquired DASCO in order to position itself to take advantage of the impending Obama administration Health sector boom. The company was immediately rebranded as Lend Lease DASCO, and operates independently of the Lend Lease Americas business.
In March 2011, Lend Lease completed the acquisition of Valemus (previously known as Bilfinger Berger Australia) from Bilfinger, subsidiaries of Valemus included: Abigroup, Baulderstone and Conneq (formerly Bilfinger Berger Services). The Valemus brand was retired and replaced with Lend Lease in 2011.
In 2015, the company rebranded to use "Lendlease" as a single word.
In December 2016 Lendlease formed a joint venture agreement with Energy Made Clean. Energy Made Clean is a wholly owned subsidiary of renewable energy technology developer, Carnegie Clean Energy (ASX: CCE). With EMC and Carnegie's joint offerings, it is the only company in the world to offer a combination of wave, solar, wind, storage and desalination via microgrids. Microgrids are a budding industry and this partnership aims to provide end-to-end technologies that deliver energy independence and a reliable alternative to traditional forms of energy in regional, remote and fringe-of-grid locations in Australia, United States and around the world.
Previous works include the Adelaide Oval upgrade finished in 2014, and the Sydney Opera House, completed in 1973 where Lendlease were the principal contractor.
The global COVID-19 pandemic led to enforced site closures during the early 2020s, impairing revenues. In February 2022, Lendlease reported a first half loss of $264 million, which it attributed to one-off restructuring costs, COVID-19 issues and asset sales. The company cut about 360 jobs and garnered savings of $160 million. An improved second half to the financial year saw the company post a bottom-line loss of $99 million for the full year, after $333 million in writedowns on existing operations, a 61% drop in development EBITDA to $18 million and a 24% slump in construction earnings to $131 million.
Regions
Asia
Lendlease Asia is working on two large urban development projects, The TRX Lifestyle Quarter in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Paya Lebar Quarter in Singapore, due for phased completion in 2020 and 2019 respectively.
Lendlease operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Greater China within the Asian Region. Its regional HQ in Asia is housed within PLQ Workplace at Paya Lebar Quarter.
Americas
In the Americas, Lendlease is based on Park Ave in New York City, United States. Current projects include Southbank, the urban regeneration of an area of Chicago, IL. That redevelopment will be finished in the late 2020s, at roughly the same time as Lendlease's urban regeneration programmes in the U.K. and Australia.
Lendlease also managed the construction of 432 Park Avenue, which, at 1,396 feet tall, is the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. It is located in one of New York City's most desired neighborhoods, alongside some of the most prestigious retail space in New York.
Lendlease also provided preconstruction and construction management and risk services for 53 West 53rd Street, a 77-story, 1,050 foot tall luxury condominium tower located in the area bound by 53rd Street and 54th Street and 5th and 6th Avenues.
It has also built for clients such as The United Nations, building the 44-story 50 United Nations Plaza in 2015, and managing a new façade at The American Museum of Natural History, a project which finished in 2013.
In 2012 Lendlease began construction on its first luxury home in an attempt to get into the high-end Southern California mansion market.
Soaring Heights, at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona, United States, is one of Lendlease's Public Partnerships business in the US. The 6 MW solar development is the largest solar powered community in the continental US, producing more than 10 million kilowatt hours of electricity, providing an estimated 75 percent of the community's energy needs.
Europe
Lendlease's European Regional Headquarters is in Regent's Place, London. In Europe, Lendlease mainly manage in the Project Management and Construction of new projects and programmes (Lendlease Project Management & Construction), with current projects including Google's brand new £700m European HQ in King's Cross, and London's first Pan Pacific Hotel for UOL Group in the City of London, which is worth over £500m. In 2015 Lendlease oversaw the restoration of the encaustic tile pavements at The Houses of Parliament.
Previous projects in Europe include Bluewater Shopping Centre, which was built in an old disused quarry and was the Europe's leading shopping centre in the late 2000s. King's College London's new science gallery and also completed the pre-construction for both London's Wembley Stadium and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but pulled out due to fears of escalating costs. They also completed apartments and the £1bn Athlete's Village for the London 2012 Olympics, which were ingenuously designed to become residential apartments once the Olympics had finished. This has turned into continued investment in Stratford through the International Quarter London, a 20-year development focussed on regenerating Stratford into a major area of London, which is all part of London 2012 Olympics's Olympic Legacy. This is the same with Elephant & Castle and Haringey, showing their focus and interest in major urban regeneration programmes in some of the World's major Gateway Cities, which currently include London, Melbourne, Sydney and Milan.

Radio Muhabura was a radio station of RPF (Rwandan Patriotic Front) during the Rwandan Civil War from 1990 to 1994. It was created in 1991 and broadcast from Uganda. It was the first alternative to Radio Rwanda, reaching all but the south of Rwanda by mid-1992. It was recorded by the BBC starting in 1992. It promoted armed resistance to the "extremist" Rwandan government. In an October 1992 broadcast it claimed that militia forces of the government's party had "devised traps aimed at exterminating the youth." As early as January 1993, months before the RTLM went on-air, Radio Muhabura accused the Rwandan government of genocide. It routinely denied RPF involvement in civilian killings, and promoted resistance to "Hutu power", to the Habyarimana government, and desertion by the military.
It regularly discussed the return of the Rwandan diaspora and the creation of a new government.
Although the pro-Hutu RTLM (which became an inciting instrument of the Rwandan genocide of 1994) was extensively listened to, Radio Muhabura had a much smaller audience, probably because it broadcast in English instead of Kinyarwanda, and its contribution to the Rwandan Civil War is not as widely discussed.
The existence of Radio Muhabura was cited as a part of the defense in the trial of Ferdinand Nahimana in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

Wallace H. Clark Jr. (May 16, 1924 – November 28, 1997) was an American dermatologist and pathologist.  They are best known for devising the "Clark's level", or Clark Level, system for classifying the seriousness of a malignant melanoma skin cancer based on its microscopic appearance.
Early life and education
Clark was born and raised in LaGrange, Georgia the son of a country doctor. After graduating from The Citadel they attended Tulane University, where they received a bachelor's degree in 1944 and an M.D. degree in 1947.
Career
They stayed at Tulane as a faculty member until 1962. They were an assistant professor of pathology and chair of the department of dermatopathology at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital from 1962 until 1969. They then moved to Temple University, where they were a professor of pathology until 1978, including four years as chair of the department. From 1978 until their retirement in 1991 they were on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine as a professor of dermatology and pathology; they also founded and chaired the university's Pigmented Lesion Clinic. Post-retirement they became a visiting professor of pathology at Harvard. They conducted research, primarily at Beth Israel Hospital, until just a few days before their death in November 1997.
Scientific contributions
While working at Harvard and Mass General during the 1960s they studied many melanomas. In 1966 they and dermatologist Thomas B. Fitzpatrick created the first Pigmented Lesion Clinic in the United States. They went on to create Pigmented Lesion Clinics at Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania. They made several seminal contributions to the understanding of melanoma.
"Clark's Classification" of melanoma Together with Martin Mihm, Clark described histogenic types of melanoma which differ in their epidemiology, as well as their clinical and histological appearance. The four major categories of Lentigo Maligna Melanoma, Superficial Spreading Melanoma, Nodular Melanoma, and Acral Lentiginous Melanoma loosely correspond to more recent molecular classification of the disease.
"Clark's level" and melanoma prognosis Clark correlated the microscopic appearance of the tumor with careful followup of the progression of the tumor and the patient's outcome. From these studies they developed a five-part scale, based on the depth of penetration of the lesion from the epidermis into the dermis and down to the subcutaneous tissue, which can be used to predict the likely progression of the tumor and the prognosis for the patient. While largely superseded by other prognostic attributes, pathologists evaluating a melanoma still classify it according to its Clark's level, and treating physicians consider that information to choose the appropriate treatment. Clark and their colleagues also made seminal observations on the importance of mitotic rate and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in primary melanomas as important prognostic variables.
Dysplastic nevi Together with Mark Greene, Margaret Tucker, and David Elder, Clark described atypical appearing moles associated with increased risk for developing melanoma and termed them dysplastic nevi.
Clark also helped to develop criteria for recognizing the early signs of a melanoma, important in promoting early diagnosis and treatment. They were a strong a proponent of patient education and gave many public lectures teaching people how to recognize the warning signs of a possible melanoma.
Recognition
The May 1999 issue of the journal Human Pathology was dedicated to the memory of Dr. Clark. The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine hosts an annual Wallace H. Clark Jr., MD, Lectureship in Cutaneous Oncology as a living memorial to Clark, describing them as a "caring and expert physician, an imaginative and rigorous investigator, and a charismatic and provocative teacher," whose "recognition of what makes people susceptible to melanoma and the appearance of early, highly curable forms of melanoma has saved countless lives."
Personal
They were married to Patricia Clark. They had two sons and four daughters. They died of a ruptured aneurysm on November 28, 1997, at their home in Kennebunkport, Maine, at the age of 74.

Mesa Arch (also known as Rotary Arch and Trail Arch) is a pothole arch on the eastern edge of the Island in the Sky mesa in Canyonlands National Park in northern San Juan County, Utah, United States. Mesa Arch is a spectacular natural stone arch perched at the edge of a cliff with vast views of canyons, Monster Tower, Washer Woman Arch, Airport Tower, and the La Sal Mountains in the distance. Access is via a relatively easy hiking trail, just a half-mile long from the park road.
Climate
Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Mesa Arch. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below −0 °C (32 °F) and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

Duke of Richelieu () was a title of French nobility. It was created on 26 November 1629 for Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu (known as Cardinal Richelieu) who, as a Roman Catholic clergyman, had no issue to pass it down to. It instead passed to their great-nephew, Armand Jean de Vignerot, grandson of their elder sister Françoise du Plessis (1577–1615), who had married René de Vignerot, Seigneur de Pontcourlay († 1625).
In 1751 they obtained the Imperial County of Rixingen, or Rechicourt-le-chateau, between Alsace and Lorraine.
Armand Jean de Vignerot added the cardinal's surname of "du Plessis" to their own, adopted the cardinal's coat of arms and received the titles of Duke of Richelieu and Peer of France by letters patent in 1657.
Two new reversions of the title occurred in 1822 and 1879. The 5th Duke of Richelieu died without an heir, but they gained permission for the title of Duke of Richelieu to pass to the son of their half-sister Simplicie, daughter of Antoine-Pierre Chapelle, Marquis de Jumilhac, with reversion to the descendants of their younger brother should they die without a male heir, thus effectively passing the title to their nephew.
The title became extinct in 1952 upon the death of the 8th Duke of Richelieu, Marie Odet Jean Armand Chapelle de Jumilhac, son of the 7th Duke of Richelieu and of Alice Heine (1858–1925). Alice was widowed in 1880 and remarried to Prince Albert I of Monaco in 1889.

Leigh East ARLFC is an amateur rugby league team from Leigh, a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, in Greater Manchester, England. They play in the National Conference League. They play their home matches at Leigh Sports Village, Ledgard Avenue and their playing colours are red and black. The club was formed in 1977 by Geoff Owen, Jim Hoffman, John Latham and Alan Prescott.
Junior rugby was always a target for East and was put into action in 1982 when u19s and u17s teams were formed. In 1989 Leigh East took over Leigh Juniors which enabled them to run teams at every age group from u7s to open age and are consistently among the top sides in Lancashire. In 1979 after campaigning the land at the side of Hilton Park became available on Grasmere St, The clubhouse was started in 1982 and officially opened in 1984.
The senior outfit's finest times have come since joining the National League. East joined in the days of two divisions and were promoted into the top division at the first attempt as runners-up to Saddleworth. The following season, the side which could definitely be considered one of the finest amateur teams of all time, won the First Division Championship and the Lancashire Cup, gave Bradford Northern the fright of their lives before losing 24-12 in the Challenge Cup and then beat Chorley Borough in the Regal Trophy to join the elite band of amateur clubs to have defeated professional opposition.
Inevitably East lost several key members of this team to professional clubs and as other players retired from the game the side became weakened and lost some of its momentum. But under the strong leadership of Steve Grimshaw and David Kay East re-built and finally battled their way out of the Conference First Division - to gain promotion into the elite Premier Division as Champions.
Beyond the first team the club has continued to thrive. The second team has consistently provided superb back-up to the senior side they started in North West Counties Division 6 and now see themselves running high in divisions 1.
Back in 1977 founders Jim Hoffman, Geoff Owen, Alan Prescott and John Latham would never in their wildest dreams - despite the hopes and ambitions they had for their new club - have imagined just how far this club would progress in such a short period of time.
There are currently 3 open age teams (1sts, 2nds, and u18s) and 9 junior teams (u8s, u9s, u10s, u11s, u12s, u13s, u14s, u15 and u16s)

Palace of Governor-General in Kyiv (, also known as the Hetman Palace), was a former building and an important city landmark in the neighborhood of Lypky in Kyiv that was destroyed by a blast in June 1920. For most of It's time it served as the official residence of the Kiev Governor General of Southwestern Krai.
Historical background
The construction date of the building is unknown. It is first mentioned in 1817. The palace was located at the corner of vulytsia Instytutska and vulytsia Levashovska (today Shovkovychna) in the vicinity of today's address numbers 18 and 20. According to the Kyivan historian Theodore-Richard Ernst the building belonged to the Major General Dmitry Begichev. Later the building was owned by Artillery Colonel Andrei Zakharovich Ivanov who land it out for profit. One of their clients was Nikolay Raevsky who stayed in the building in 1821-25. In 1833 Ivanov sold the house to the state treasury for 100,000 rubles.
Since then the building was used as an official residence. The first resident of the house was Vasiliy Levashov, the first official Governor General. Until 1914 the palace was a residence of the Governor General of Southwestern Krai. Upon liquidation of the position, the building was given to the Kyiv governor in 1915. In January 1918, just before the Bolshevik forces sacked Kiev, Volodymyr Vynnychenko was able to secure the palace after the General Secretariat of Ukraine. However right after the establishment of the Ukrainian State on April 29, 1918, the house was redesignated as an official residence of the Hetman of Ukraine and after December 14, 1918 belonged to Symon Petliura.
Due to war and political situation, none of the Ukrainian state official stayed in the house for long. In 1919-20 the power in Kyiv changed rapidly with advancement of the Russian forces of White Guard movement and the Liberation forces of Poland. In spring of 1920 Kyiv for a short period (five weeks) was occupied by the Ukrainian allied Polish forces (anti-Bolshevik pact) and the palace was used as an ammo storage. Upon withdrawal the building was blown into pieces. Due to the extent of a damage the building could not be rebuilt and in 1925 a small city park was created in its place.
Description
Blueprints of Vladimir Nikolayev of 1879 give an idea about facade of the Governor General Palace. Its length constituted , to the right there were a three windows annex with a cast iron porch on columns as a side entrance, while further there were a four windows annex of the Saint Nicholas Dome Church that was built on the funds of the Russian Ministry of Interior. The full length of structure along vulytsia Instytutska amounted to .
A hall of official receptions was located across a significant part of the building. During times of Trepov it was refurbished with white gilded furniture, while floor was covered with a white and pink carpet. The Cabinet of the Governor-General and their family rooms were located on the second floor.
The whole mansion was composed of three parts, while a bigger area was occupied by an old orchard which partially was left preserved to our days. The orchid was once a part of the Klov Park. On a corner there was a kitchen side house that was connected with the palace by a stone gallery and other outbuilding (sheds for firewood and ice storage). Separately, via gates towards Instytutska, there was located household yard with large stables, cartwright, barn, orangery and coachman house. A "stone barn for automobiles" was built in December 1911. Wooden stripped booths for guards stood to the side from the cast iron porch.

Barbara Daly Baekeland (September 28, 1921 – November 17, 1972) was a wealthy American socialite who was murdered by their son, Antony "Tony" Baekeland. They were the ex-wife of Brooks Baekeland, who was the grandson of Leo Baekeland, inventor of Bakelite plastic.
They were murdered at their London home when their son Antony stabbed them with a kitchen knife, killing them almost instantly. Antony was found at the scene of the crime, and later confessed to and was charged with their murder.
Early life
Barbara Daly was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In January 1933, when Barbara was aged 11, their father, Frank, committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust of their car in the garage. After the life insurance payment had been collected, Barbara and their mother moved to New York City, taking up residence in the Delmonico Hotel.
Career
As a young woman living in New York City, Barbara became a prominent socialite. They were recognized for their beauty, posing for painters and modeling with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Them social status and beauty resulted in frequent invitations to high society parties, allowing them to date various wealthy admirers. They also had mental health problems like their mother, and was a private patient of psychiatrist Foster Kennedy.
An invitation to Hollywood for a screen test with the actor Dana Andrews did not lead to film stardom, but did lead to a friendship with fellow aspiring actor Cornelia "Dickie" Baekeland. They introduced Barbara to their younger brother Brooks, a trainee pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Marriage
After Barbara falsely told Brooks Baekeland that they were pregnant, the couple quickly married in California. At the time of the marriage, Barbara listed their profession as painter, while Brooks listed theirs as writer.
After the marriage the couple set up home in a luxury apartment in the Upper East Side of New York, where they held extravagant dinner parties for their friends, who included Greta Garbo, Tennessee Williams, William Styron, and Yasmin Aga Khan. Over time, Barbara became well known to many for their unstable personality, rude outbursts, and bouts of severe depression. They also drank heavily, and both they and their husband participated in extramarital affairs.
Barbara gave birth to a son, Antony Baekeland, on August 28, 1946.
From the summer of 1954 onward, with Antony aged eight, the Baekeland family led a nomadic seasonal existence, maintaining their home in New York while being mainly based in Europe. Renting houses and villas in London, Paris, Zermatt, Cap d'Antibes, and many parts of Italy, Barbara and Brooks continued to live extravagantly, entertain guests, and have affairs. From 1960 onward, the family's main base was an apartment in Paris, where during one party, Brooks met an English diplomat's daughter who was 15 years their junior. After Brooks requested a divorce and Barbara subsequently tried to commit suicide, Brooks terminated the affair.
In 1967, at which time the family was based in both Switzerland and the Spanish resort of Cadaques, the 20-year-old Antony met Jake Cooper, a bisexual Australian man. Cooper introduced Antony to various hallucinogenic drugs, which they traveled to Morocco to obtain. Antony and Cooper also allegedly began an affair at this time, though this is denied by Cooper. When Mrs. Baekeland was informed of this by their friend Barbara Curteis, they traveled by car to Spain to bring their son back to Switzerland. However, at the French border, Antony was found not to have their passport. After the ensuing fracas, both Antony and Barbara were arrested and placed in jail.
Divorce
Returning to Spain, Barbara accepted the extent of their son's relationship with Cooper, but preferred their developing relationship with a young Spanish girl, Sylvie. However, Sylvie then started an affair with Barbara's husband Brooks. After discovering the affair in February 1968, Barbara again tried to commit suicide. Brooks decided that they had had enough of Barbara's behavior and again, pursued a divorce. This led Barbara to severe depression and another suicide attempt, from which their friend Gloria Jones, wife of author James Jones, saved them
Brooks married Sylvie and had one son. They later divorced and they married Susan Baekeland.
In 1969, Barbara met noted pop art curator Samuel Adams Green, with whom they started an affair. When later introduced to their son Antony, Green was very unimpressed by their artistic capabilities. After six weeks, Green broke off the relationship, although Barbara was still obsessed with him. They pursued Green relentlessly; when they returned to the United States that fall, they walked barefoot across Central Park in the snow wearing nothing but a Lynx fur coat to demand entry to their apartment.
Relationship with son
Barbara Baekeland had a complex and allegedly incestuous relationship with their son, Antony Baekeland, who was gay or bisexual. Baekeland attempted to "fix" their son by hiring prostitutes to have sex with him. After this failed, while the pair were living in Majorca in the summer of 1968 following Barbara and Brooks's divorce, Barbara was alleged to have raped them son.
During their young adulthood, Antony displayed increasingly regular signs of schizophrenia with paranoid tendencies, and their erratic behavior caused concern among family friends. They were eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia; however, their father initially refused to allow them to be treated by psychiatrists, a profession they believed to be "amoral".
Murder
In late July 1972, Antony tried to throw their mother under the traffic outside their penthouse on Cadogan Square in Chelsea, London. They were only saved by their physical weakness, and the intervention of their friend Susan Guinness. Although the Metropolitan Police arrested Antony for attempted murder, Barbara refused to press charges. Antony was subsequently admitted to The Priory private psychiatric hospital, but was released soon afterwards.
Antony then undertook sessions with a psychiatrist while living at home. The doctor became so concerned about Antony's condition that on October 30, they warned Barbara that they were capable of murder. Barbara dismissed the doctor's assertion.
Two weeks later, on November 17, 1972, Antony murdered their mother by stabbing them with a kitchen knife, killing them almost instantly. They were 51 years of age at the time, and Antony was 25. Police arrived and found Antony at the scene of the crime. They later confessed to, and was charged with, their murder.
Antony was institutionalized at Broadmoor Hospital until July 21, 1980, when, at the urging of a group of their friends, they were released.
Antony's death
Upon their release, Antony, now aged 33, flew directly to New York City to stay with their 87-year-old maternal grandmother, Nini Daly. Only six days after their release, on July 27, they attacked them with a kitchen knife, stabbing them eight times and breaking several bones. They were then arrested by the New York City Police Department, charged with attempted murder and sent to Rikers Island prison.
After eight months of assessment by the psychiatric team at Rikers Island, they were expecting to be released on bail at a court hearing on March 20, 1981. However, the case was adjourned by the judge due to a delay in the transfer of their medical records from the UK. Antony returned to their cell at 3:30 PM EST on March 20, 1981, and was found dead by suicide 30 minutes later, suffocated by a plastic bag.
Savage Grace
The 2007 film Savage Grace is based on the life of Barbara and Antony Baekeland, beginning with Antony's birth and following the family to the time of Antony's arrest for the murder of their mother. The movie–starring Julianne Moore, Stephen Dillane, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Dancy, Elena Anaya, and Unax Ugalde–was based on the book of the same name.
After the film opened, Barbara Baekeland's former lover Samuel Adams Green wrote an article pointing out elements in the film, which were potentially misleading for those trying to read back to the reality inspiring it. They referred in particular to the menage-a-trois scene, which depicted Barbara, Antony, and Sam Green in bed together having sex. Green wrote:
Green then embarked on legal action against the filmmakers, which was still unresolved at the time of their death.

The Big Eight Conference is a defunct college athletic conference that was formerly affiliated with the NCAA's Division I-A (now known as FBS).
The Big Eight Conference was a successful football conference, with its member schools being recognized as consensus national champion on eleven occasions, including the last two football seasons the conference existed (1994 and 1995). Seven players from the Big Eight won the Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious national award for college football players.
Membership timeline
History
The conference was formed in 1907 as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA) by five charter schools: the University of Kansas, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, University of Iowa, and Washington University in St. Louis. After the MVIAA grew to ten schools, six state schools split away on their own in 1928, becoming known as the "Big Six": Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma. The University of Colorado was added in 1948, and the conference became known as the "Big Seven Conference". Oklahoma State joined in 1958, becoming the eighth and final member. The conference broke up when its members joined the Big 12 Conference in 1996.
Due to its common history with the Missouri Valley Conference, Big Eight championships from 1907 through 1927 are also claimed by the MVC.
Bowl games
The first Big Eight conference team to attend a bowl game was Missouri, at the 1924 Los Angeles Christmas Festival. Following the 1938 season Oklahoma became the second to attend a bowl game, at the fifth-annual Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. In 1951 and 1952 the conference had a brief ban on its members attending bowl games. When the conference resumed accepting invitations in 1953, its champion regularly thereafter attended the Orange Bowl. This tradition was broken only five times: 1964 (when Nebraska faced #2 Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl); 1966 (when Nebraska faced #3 Alabama in the Sugar Bowl); 1973 and 1974 (when undefeated Oklahoma was on probation and barred from bowl games); and 1995 (when #1 Nebraska played in the Bowl Alliance championship vs. #2 Florida at the Fiesta Bowl).
At the 1979 Orange Bowl, #6 Nebraska and #4 Oklahoma were paired against each other in a rematch of their conference game earlier in the season.
Rankings
In the 1971 NCAA University Division football season, Big Eight teams finished ranked #1 (Nebraska), #2 (Oklahoma) and #3 (Colorado) in the nation in the AP Poll – the only time in college football history teams from one conference have held the top three spots in the final poll. In the final AP Poll issued before the Big Eight became the Big 12, half of the conference's teams were ranked in the nation's top 10 (#1 Nebraska, #5 Colorado, #7 Kansas State, #9 Kansas).
Rivalries
The Nebraska–Oklahoma football rivalry was one of the most significant in the nation, with national title implications involved during many seasons. The 1971 Nebraska vs. Oklahoma football game is commonly referred to as "The Game of the Century."
With common histories dating back even before the 1907 formation of the conference, many of the Big Eight's rivalries were among the most-played in college football. At the time the Big Eight Conference dissolved in 1996, the conference had the two longest uninterrupted series in Division I-A football: Kansas–Oklahoma (played annually since 1903) and Kansas–Nebraska (played annually since 1906). Many of the conference's series began in the 19th century, including:
Kansas–Missouri, first played in 1891 (second-most played series in Division I-A in 1996)
Nebraska–Kansas, first played in 1892
Nebraska–Missouri, first played in 1892
Missouri–Iowa State, first played in 1896
Nebraska–Iowa State, first played in 1896
Kansas–Iowa State, first played in 1898
All of the above series except Kansas-Iowa State have been inactive since at least 2012 due to conference realignment.
Champions
Conference champions
Following are the MVIAA/Big Eight football conference champions from 1907 to 1995 (shared championship years are shown in italics):
† Kansas would have won the 1960 title, but after found to be using an ineligible player they were forced to forfeit their victories over Missouri and Colorado, which meant that Missouri was awarded the 1960 Big Eight title.
‡ Oklahoma initially won the 1972 title, but after it was found that they used ineligible players, they were penalized by the NCAA, though they did not force OU to forfeit games. The Big Eight asked them to forfeit three games and awarded the title to Nebraska, but Oklahoma still claims these wins and this title.
National championships
Big Eight football teams were recognized as national champion on eleven occasions, including four times as back-to-back champions:
1950 – Oklahoma
1955 – Oklahoma
1956 – Oklahoma
1970 – Nebraska (AP; UPI coaches conducted final poll prior to bowl games and awarded championship to Texas)
1971 – Nebraska
1974 – Oklahoma (AP; ineligible for UPI coaches poll championship due to NCAA probation. USC named champion of coaches poll)
1975 – Oklahoma
1985 – Oklahoma
1990 – Colorado (AP; UPI coaches poll championship awarded to Georgia Tech)
1994 – Nebraska
1995 – Nebraska
Accolades
The Big Seven Conference established a Coach of the Year award in 1948. The conference began awarding a Player of the Year award in 1967, and began giving separate offensive and defensive awards in 1971. The final awards were given after the 1995 season, after which all of the Big Eight schools entered the Big 12 Conference.

SN Systems is a provider of Windows based development tools for games consoles, including the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation, PlayStation Vita, and PSP.
The company had provided tools for the Atari ST, Amiga, Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Super NES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS.
History
The company was founded in 1990 by Martin Day and Andy Beveridge. Both directors have backgrounds of developing game console software development tools, such as SNASM and Psy-Q, at Cross Products and later Psygnosis.
SN Systems' long association with the PlayStation line of consoles began in 1993, when PlayStation manufacturer Sony acquired Psygnosis, who were publishing SN Systems' tools at the time. While Sony had provided MIPS R4000-based Sony NEWS workstations for PlayStation development, Psygnosis disliked the thought of developing on these expensive workstations and asked SN Systems to create a PC-based development system. At the 1994 Winter Consumer Electronics Show, Psygnosis arranged an audience for SN Systems with Sony's Japanese executives, and Sony were impressed enough with their development tools that they decided to abandon their plans for a workstation-based development system in favor of using SN Systems' development system exclusively.
In 1999, SN Systems won a Game Developer Magazine "Front Line Award" in the Programming Environment category for its Nintendo 64 development product called SN64. The company won again in 2005, this time for the ProDG for PSP suite.
SN Systems was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. in 2005, to provide tools for the PlayStation 3, and future consoles.
Based in Bristol, England, they have satellite offices in Campbell, California and Dublin, Ireland.
Products
Central to the SN Systems product line is the ProDG suite, comprising a compiler and integration with Microsoft Visual Studio, together with a debugger and additional build tools.

The Surucua trogon (Trogon surrucura) is a species of bird in the family Trogonidae, the quetzals and trogons. It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
Taxonomy and systematics
The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and the Clements taxonomy recognize two subspecies of Surucua trogon, the nominate T. s. surrucura and T. s. aurantius. BirdLife International's Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) treats these two forms as separate species, the "southern" and "northern" Surucua trogons respectively.
Description
The nominate subspecies T. s. surrucura is long and weighs . The male has a blackish face and throat with an orange ring around the eye. The crown, neck, and breast are royal blue and the back a coppery green that transitions to turquoise-green on the upperside of the tail. The folded wing has fine vermiculation that looks gray at a distance. The belly is pinkish red and the flanks gray. The underside of the tail is white with a black bar across the end. The female is mostly gray with the red of the belly beginning lower. Instead of the orange ring around the eye there are small white spots before and after it. The underside of the tail has a black and white pattern. T. s. aurantius is about long. The male differs from the nominate by having a yellow eye ring and an orange belly. The female's belly is yellowish white to orange-yellow.
Distribution and habitat
The nominate subspecies of Surucua trogan is found from eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina east into Uruguay and in Brazil as far north as southeastern Tocantins. T. s. aurantius has a more restricted range in east central and eastern Brazil from Bahia south to São Paulo state. They inhabit the mid levels of primary and well-developed secondary forest and semideciduous woodland. T. s. aurantius often associates with bamboo. T. s. surrucura occurs as high as in Bahia, in Minas Gerais, and higher still in Rio de Janeiro state. T. s. aurantius occurs up to about .
Behavior
Migration
The more northerly T. s. aurantius appears to be a year round resident in its range. T. s. surrucura is mostly sedentary but the southernmost birds move north for the austral winter.
Feeding
The Surucua trogon's diet includes a wide variety of insects, both adults and larva, and also fruits and occasionally flowers. It sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks.
Breeding
The Surucua trogon's breeding season spans from September to December and possibly into January. The nest is a cavity in a decayed tree or an arboreal termite nest. The one described clutch contained three eggs.
Vocalization
The Surucua trogon's song is "an ascending sequence of moderately high-pitched, 14–20 full 'diu' or 'kwa' notes, which increase slightly in amplitude". It makes a "kiarr" warning call.
Status
The IUCN follows HBW taxonomy and so treats the southern and northern Surucua trogons separtately. It assesses both as being of The Least Concern. The population of neither has been quantified but both are believed to be decreasing. Both subspecies are found in several protected areas but outside them are known to be affected by forest fragmentation.

The Mortimer Trap is a chess opening trap in the Ruy Lopez named after James Mortimer. The Mortimer Trap is a true trap in the sense that Black deliberately plays an inferior move to tempt White into making a mistake.
Analysis
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6
The trap begins with Black playing the Berlin Defense to the Ruy Lopez. Although the Berlin was much more popular in the 19th century than in the 20th, it "became the height of theory when Vladimir Kramnik used it as their main defense to defeat Garry Kasparov in their 2000 World Championship match."
4. d3
White plays a quiet alternative to the more common 4.0-0, 4.d4, or 4.Nc3 (the last would transpose to the Four Knights Game). I. A. Horowitz and Fred Reinfeld wrote that 4.d3 is "Steinitz's move, with which they scored many spectacular successes during their long reign as World Champion."
4... Ne7
The Mortimer Defense, intending to reroute the knight to g6. This rare move loses and thus is inferior to other moves, but it sets a trap. White has many acceptable replies, but the tempting capture of the black pawn on e5 is a mistake.
5. Nxe5? c6! (see diagram)
Attacking the white bishop and threatening 6...Qa5+. If the bishop moves (6.Ba4 or 6.Bc4), Black wins a piece with 6...Qa5+, forking the white king and knight.
6. Nc4
White's best try, covering a5 and thus preventing 6...Qa5+, and threatening smothered mate with 7.Nd6#.
6... d6! 7. Ba4 b5
Black forks the white bishop and knight, winning a piece for two pawns.
Discussion
Mortimer played their defense at the 1883 London tournament against Berthold Englisch, Samuel Rosenthal, and Josef Noa, losing all three games. Johannes Zukertort, the tournament winner, also played it against Englisch, the game resulting in a draw. Zukertort wrote of 4...Ne7, "Mr. Mortimer claims to be the inventor of this move. I adopted it on account of its novelty." The first edition of the treatise Chess Openings, Ancient and Modern analyzed 5.Nc3 Ng6 6.0-0 c6 7.Ba4 d6 8.Bb3 and now the authors gave either 8...Be6 or 8...Be7 as giving Black an equal game. A bit more recently, Horowitz and Reinfeld observed of 4...Ne7, "This time-wasting retreat of the Knight to an inferior square blocks the development of the King Bishop ... . Yet it is a matter of record that this pitfall had a vogue for many years."
Today, 4...Ne7 is rarely seen, and is not mentioned in either Modern Chess Openings (which relegates 4.d3 to a footnote, and mentions only 4...d6 in response) or the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (which mentions only 4...d6 and 4...Bc5).

Donatien Laurent (27 September 1935 – 25 March 2020) was a French musicologist and linguist.
Biography
Donatien was born in Belfort to polytechnician Pierre Laurent and a musician mother from Nantes. During their secondary education in Paris, they discovered Breton culture. They joined the Bleimor Scouts and became a bagpiper. They joined their friend Herri Léon in a program at the College of Piping in Scotland. The two friends revolutionized the bagpipe in the bagadoù, which would create conflicts with Bodadeg ar Sonerion.
As part of their interest in Breton music, Laurent accompanied their friends as a teenager to Paris to make sound collections of music from Bro Gwened. Their first solo recording came in the summer of 1956 in Le Conquet on their brother's tape recorder. After a serious accident the following year which left them in a coma for 18 days, Laurent was declared by doctors unfit to continue studies. Therefore, they devoted themselves to research on Breton culture. They were licensed to conduct research by Paris-Sorbonne University under the supervision of André Leroi-Gourhan. Later, Gourhan offered to help Laurent conduct research in Plozévet in 1964. During their time in Plozévet, Laurent met a descendant of Théodore Claude Henri, vicomte Hersart de la Villemarqué at the Manoir de Keransquer.
In 1965, Laurent met their eventual wife, Françoise Prigent. They actively supported them during their writing of Sources de Barz. With La Villemarqué's descendant, Laurent was able to obtain many original collections of notebooks which helped in the writing of Barzaz Breiz. Laurent used these works to aid their thesis, written in 1974.
Laurent directed the Center for Research on Breton and Celtic (CRBC) and the University of Western Brittany for twelve years. In 2015, Dastum, alongside the CRBC and Laurent, created an online platform for their works, including 136 surveys conducted between the 1950s and the 1970s.
Donatien Laurent died on 25 March 2020 in Brest at the age of 84.

Alexandra Lahey ( ) (born 30 July 1992) is an Australian alternative rock singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Them debut album, I Love You Like a Brother was released on 6 October 2017 and peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart.
Early life
Alex Lahey was born in 1992 and grew up in Melbourne with their mother, Vicki, their father Bill and their brother, Will. At 13-years-old they started learning saxophone and guitar. They started university courses in both jazz and the arts but dropped out of the jazz component to join a local pop group, Animaux, on vocals and saxophone. After completing their arts degree Lahey decided to start a solo music career.
Career
In June 2016 Lahey won the Josh Pyke Partnership, for unsigned artists, which is co-sponsored by Pyke, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS). They received a AUD$7500 grant, a song writing mentorship from Pyke and introduction to music industry officials. Lahey won the prize ahead of 200 entries and Pyke explained, "the song they submitted was immediately stuck in my head, and their lyrics were compelling and clever. Them turn of phrase was quirky and intelligent, and really relatable... I reckon most of us have been in the situation that's portrayed in the song 'You Don't Think You Like People Like Me'."
"You Don't Think You Like People Like Me" also received Pitchfork's Best New Track Award, and it was listed in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2016 at No. 97. Lahey subsequently won a Triple J Unearthed prize, leading to a performance slot at Splendour in the Grass and a nomination for a J Award as Unearthed Artist of the Year.
Lahey's debut extended play (EP), B-Grade University, was released on 29 July 2016, via Caroline Australia Records with distribution by Universal Music Australia. For the five tracks Lahey provided vocals, guitar, saxophone and keyboards; they were joined by Oscar Dawson on guitar, vocals, percussion and keyboards; Sam Humphrey on guitar; Kai Chen Lim on bass guitar; and Lachie McGeehan on drums. Dawson also produced, engineered and mixed the EP. It reached No. 95 on the ARIA Top 100 Physical Albums and No. 8 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums charts.
In January 2017 Lahey signed to the Dead Oceans label, which re-released their EP. On 6 October 2017 they issued their debut album, I Love You Like a Brother, through their own independent label, Nicky Boy Records/Dead Oceans via Caroline Australia/Universal Music Australia. It reached No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart; Laura Stanley of Under the Radar observed, "[she] shares scenes from their own period of self-discovery, which makes for a fierce and incredibly fun debut full-length... the record standouts happen when Lahey and their bandmates zoom through spells of heartache with candidness and in a sharp pop-punk style."
I Love You Like a Brother was placed on several albums-of-the-year lists, including Bandcamp Daily (at No. 40), Noisey, the Sydney Morning Herald, Under the Radar, BrooklynVegan, and redbull.com. Spin Magazine would also cite the album as one of the magazine's 13 "Favorite Overlooked Albums of 2017". After touring Australia through October 2017, Lahey undertook an international tour of US and Europe from December 2017 and April 2018. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018 they were nominated for Breakthrough Artist – Release.
In May 2019, Lahey released their second album 'The Best of Luck Club'. The album was produced by Catherine Marks along with Lahey. Lahey spent all of 2019 touring Australia, North America, Europe and the UK and had extensive touring plans for 2020 before they were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The song "Misery Guts" from the album was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2.
In 2020, Lahey wrote and recorded the original song "On My Way" for Sony Picture Animation's The Mitchells vs. the Machines, now Netflix's biggest original animated release of all time. The song was also released on the official film soundtrack via Sony Classical.
On 21 October 2021, Lahey revealed they had signed with Liberation Records and released "Spike the Punch".
On 31 August 2022, Lahey released "Congratulations" and announced national tour, commencing in October 2022. It'll be their first since 2019.
Personal life
Lahey identifies as gay. Them partner is fellow Australian musician Gordi. The two released a collaboration, "Dino's", in early 2021.

St Gwenfaen's Well (also known as , and ) is an early medieval holy well in the south west of Holy Island, Anglesey, named after St Gwenfaen, whose cloister was nearby. The site includes substantial remains of a building and is both a scheduled monument and a Grade II listed building. Traditionally, a gift of two white quartz pebbles thrown into the pool can cure mental health problems.
Location
St Gwenfaen's Well lies in an isolated position in a cleft in the rock in a dell overlooking the cliffs of Porth Gwalch (Welsh: Hawk Bay) in the community of Rhoscolyn in the south west of Holy Island, Anglesey. The well is just under west by south west of the village of Rhoscolyn which is the location of St Gwenfaen's Church, part of the ministry area of Holy Island (Church in Wales).
As with much of Holy Island, the well lies within the area of the Glannau Ynys Gybi (Welsh: Holy Island Coast) Site of Special Scientific Interest and the Anglesey Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Description
The remains of the drystone well house are east-west by (originally) north-south. Three steps descend into the building from the east into a square chamber with a flagstone floor and four diagonal stone seats in each corner. A narrow opening and steps lead into the rectangular well chamber, east-west by north-south, with recessed semi-circular seats at each side.
An outer external well chamber roughly square contains the well itself, and is separated from the internal well chamber by a drystone wall, which includes a stone slab with circular grooves cut in its upper and lower edges to allow water to flow between the two chambers. The external chamber can be reached by six descending stone steps on either side cut into the cleft in the rock.
At the western end a stone slab with a hole allows water to be retained in the chamber or be released into a long paved channel leading to a pool west of the well.
St Gwenfaen's Well has not been accurately dated but is assumed to be medieval. The nearby church dedicated to St Gwenfaen is on the site of an older church dating from 630 AD.
History and legend
Gwenfaen was the daughter of Paul Hen of Manaw (who also known as Old Paulinus), and sister of Peulan and Gwyngeneu, both saints who also lived on Holy Island. They were known for healing mental illness. While being chased by druids, Gwenfaen is said to have climbed a nearby rock stack and was carried away by angels when the tide came in.
An offering of two white quartz pebbles into the water of the well is said to cure mental problems.
Recent history
St Gwenfaen's Well was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1971 and as a scheduled monument in 1987.
The well is blessed every year on, or near, Gwenfaen's Saint's day, 4 November, after Holy Communion in the nearby church.
Access
St Gwenfaen's Well can be reached by footpath, either by a circular route around Rhoscolyn or by following the Anglesey Coastal Path (part of the Wales Coast Path).

The Butterfly Effect is the debut extended play by Australian hard rock group the Butterfly Effect, released in late 2001. This is the only recording by the band to feature bass player Michael Cavendish before they were replaced by Glenn Esmond. While the band's style is mainly alternative metal, it also shows some nu metal in their sound, which is not found on later releases.
"Take It Away" was issued as a single and received high rotation, particularly from national youth radio station, Triple J.
History
The Butterfly Effect formed in Brisbane in 1999 by drummer Ben Hall, guitarist Kurt Goedhart and a few schoolmates. This version played a few live shows in 1999, including one at the Ipswich Racecourse, where Hall met their future lead singer, Clint Boge, after the show. The pair discussed musical ideas for what would become the band's early material and, by mid-2000, Boge had replaced the early vocalist. They released their self-titled debut six-track extended play in late 2001. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic described how "[it] quickly entered steady rotation on the influential Aussie radio outlet Triple J and eventually sold in excess of 10,000 copies." It was re-released in June 2002 via Sony Music Australia.

John William Davis (March 7, 1826 – January 25, 1907) was a United States Democratic politician, who served as the 38th and 41st Governor of Rhode Island (1887–1888 and 1890–1891).
Early life and career
John W. Davis was born at their family's farm house in Rehoboth, Massachusetts on March 7, 1826. They attended public schools in Rehoboth and a private school in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Before entering politics, they were engaged in various occupations; in 1844 they moved to Providence to become apprenticed as a mason. They also received their certification as a schoolteacher, and for several years traveled through the southern states to work in both professions. Davis then started in partnership with their brother a grain and provisions business on South Water Street in Providence, which operated from 1850 to 1890.
During the American Civil War, they served in the Rhode Island Militia, first as a member of an infantry unit, and later in a local unit known as the Providence Horse Guards.
Early political career
Their first experience in politics was as a member of the Democratic City Committee of Providence in 1854.
Davis moved to Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1877 to serve as the resident manager of Riverside Cemetery. They lived on the cemetery grounds in a wooden octagonal gatehouse. Davis served in a number of local offices in Pawtucket. In 1882 and 1885 they served on the Town Council. They served in the Rhode Island Senate in 1885 and 1886.
In 1886, Davis was appointed by fellow Democratic President Grover Cleveland as an Appraiser of Foreign Merchandise for the Providence U.S. Customs District.
Governor
Davis served two nonconsecutive one-year terms as governor. They were the first Democratic governor since the 1850s and the first Pawtucket resident in the State House since Joseph Jenckes Jr. in the 1730s. Their progressive administration was known for giving foreign-born residents the same voting rights as native-born citizens, expanding suffrage to women, establishing the boundary line between Rhode Island and Connecticut, and reforming election laws and orphanages.
First term
They were Democratic gubernatorial nominee in 1887 and defeated incumbent Republican George P. Wetmore. Davis won with support from many Republicans, who were unhappy with party leadership.
During their first term as governor, the Women's Suffrage Amendment to the state constitution was approved, the boundary line between Rhode Island and Connecticut was established, and election laws were reformed to eliminate fraud. Davis was defeated for re-election in 1888 by Republican candidate Royal C. Taft, but ran again in 1889 against Herbert W. Ladd.
Plurality is not enough to win
Prior to 1893, Rhode Island's constitution had a majority election requirement; that is, if no candidate for state races received an outright majority, the result would be decided by the General Assembly. This became an issue during a period of four years, 1889-1893, during which the rise of the Prohibition Party caused several state races to be sent to the Assembly for decision. Three times, in 1889, 1890, and 1891, Democrat Davis received more votes than Republican Ladd in the governor's race, yet did not receive a majority. The Assembly decided in favor of Ladd twice (1889 and 1891) and for Davis in 1890. This situation was eventually remedied in November 1893 by the adoption of Amendment X to the Rhode Island Constitution, which allowed for a winner by plurality vote.
Second term
During Davis's second administration the governor was given authorization to appoint a commission to revise and codify general statutes, and funds were appropriated for completion of a Soldiers' Home. They undertook the construction of College Hall at the University of Rhode Island, then the largest building on campus. When it burned down in 1895 and was rebuilt, it was renamed Davis Hall in their honor.
Davis was defeated for re-election once again in 1891, but did not retire from active politics; they were elected to the state Senate from Pawtucket in 1892, and served as Mayor of Pawtucket in 1897. They also served on the State House Commission.
Davis died on January 25, 1907, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  They are buried at Riverside Cemetery, where they had previously served as manager.
Marriage
Davis was married three times: to Lydia W. Kenyon (died 1859); Emily P. Goffe, two children; and Marietta P. Pearse. Davis was raised Methodist and later became Episcopalian.

Verne L. Reynolds (July 5, 1879 - October 24, 1948) was an American socialist activist. Reynolds was a multi-time candidate for national office with the Socialist Labor Party of America.
In 1924, Reynold was the SLP's vice-presidential nominee. They were on the ticket with Frank T. Johns of Oregon. The SLP ticket earned 28,633 votes and was on the ballot in 19 states.
In May 1928, Reynolds was nominated again to run for vice-president alongside Johns. However, Johns died later that month trying to rescue a young boy who had fallen in a river at a campaign event in Bend, Oregon. Two days after their death, Reynolds was nominated as the SLP's nominee for president alongside Jeremiah D. Crowley. The Reynolds/Crowley campaign received 21,590 votes in 19 states.
Reynolds was again the SLP's presidential nominee in 1932. Alongside vice-presidential nominee John W. Aiken, the campaign increased the number of votes received to 34,038, which was the most for a SLP presidential ticket since the 1900 election.
Mack Reynolds
Verne's son was the science fiction writer Mack Reynolds, who wrote one of the first Star Trek novels. Mack was an active member of the SLP; their fiction often dealt with socialist reform and revolution as well as socialist utopian thought and their characters often used DeLeonite terminology such as "industrial feudalism".

FLicKeR is a Canadian documentary film written and directed by Nik Sheehan, produced by Maureen Judge and Silva Basmajian (NFB). The film is based on the book Chapel of Extreme Experience by John G. Geiger about the work of artist Brion Gysin and their Dreamachine.
Gysin's Dreamachine used a 100-watt light bulb, a motor, and a rotating cylinder with cutouts. Its users would sit in front of it, close their eyes, and experience visions as a result of the flashes of light. Gysin believed that by offering the world a drugless high the invention could revolutionize human consciousness.
The documentary features interviews with many prominent figures from the beat movement who had experimented with Gysin's invention and discuss their life and ideas in the film. Notable figures include Marianne Faithfull, DJ Spooky, The Stooges, Iggy Pop, Lee Ranaldo, Genesis P-Orridge, John Giorno, Floria Sigismondi, and Kenneth Anger.
The film premiered in Toronto in 2008 at the international documentary film festival Hot Docs and received the festival's award for the best Best Canadian Feature Documentary . It then went on to win in the Best Film on International Art category at the 2009 Era New Horizons Film Festival in Poland, and was also nominated for a 2009 Gemini Award in the category of Best Performing Arts Program or Series or Arts Documentary Program or Series, and best original score by composer Edmund Eagan.

Reference Re Alberta Statutes, also known as the Alberta Press case and the Alberta Press Act Reference, is a landmark reference of the Supreme Court of Canada where several provincial laws, including one restricting the press, were struck down and the existence of an implied bill of rights protecting civil liberties such as a free press was first proposed.
Background
The province of Alberta, under the Social Credit government of William Aberhart had passed several laws as part of a series of reforms inspired by social credit economic theory. Arising from the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta passed several Acts to implement the Social Credit agenda, to which royal assent was given:
Credit of Alberta Regulation Act (requiring all bankers to obtain a license from the Social Credit Commission)
Bank Employees Civil Rights Act (preventing unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions)
Judicature Act Amendment Act (preventing any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's laws in court without receiving the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council)
In August 1937, the federal government disallowed all three Acts. The Supreme Court of Canada, in answering reference questions posed by the federal government, unanimously ruled that such disallowance was valid.
Following the disallowance, the Alberta legislature passed the following bills in October 1937:
Bill No. 1 Bank Taxation Act (levying provincial taxes on banks' paid-up capital and reserve funds at punitive rates)
Bill No. 8 Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, 1937 (similar to the previous disallowed Act, but covering all "credit institutions")
Bill No. 9 Accurate News and Information Act (requiring newspapers to print "clarifications" of stories considered inaccurate by the Social Credit Board, and to reveal their sources on demand, and also authorizing the provincial government to prohibit the publication of any newspaper, any article by a given writer, or any article making use of a given source)
All bills were reserved by Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen. As a result, the federal government posed reference questions to the Supreme Court as to whether it was intra vires the provincial legislature to pass any of those measures.
Reference to the Supreme Court of Canada
All six members of the Court declared the subject matter of all the bills as ultra vires the province. In addition, the Court ruled 5-0 (Cannon J expressing no opinion) that the Alberta Social Credit Act was unconstitutional as well, as it attempted to intrude on the federal powers relating to currency, banks and banking, and trade and commerce.
As to the Accurate News and Information Act, five of the six justices stated that, since the press bill was ancillary to the Alberta Social Credit Act which had been ruled ultra vires, the press bill was automatically as well, while Cannon J considered the subject matter of the bill to be solely under federal jurisdiction. In their concurring opinion for the majority, Duff CJ and Davis J argued that press freedom was too important to be left entirely to the provinces. The three judges argued that the preamble of the British North America Act, 1867, which states that Canada has a constitution similar to that of the United Kingdom, implies that freedom of the press is vital to Canada's democratic system.
Appeal to the Privy Council
The Board declared that, as the Alberta Social Credit Act had been subsequently repealed by the Alberta legislature, Bills 8 and 9 could not be brought into operation, as their provisions were contingent on actions of the now-abolished Social Credit Board. Therefore, the question was moot, and they expressed no opinion on them.
As to Bill 1, the Board agreed with the opinion of Kerwin J (concurred in by Crocket J) that:
Accordingly, the bill was in pith and substance a measure to regulate banking, and was thus ultra vires the province.
Significance
The SCC ruling was one of the foundation cases leading to the recognition of an Implied Bill of Rights in Canadian constitutional law.

Mondragón ( or Mondragoe), officially known as Arrasate/Mondragón, is a town and municipality in Gipuzkoa Province, Basque Country, Spain. Its population in 2015 was 21,933.
Economic and historical significance
The town is best known as the birthplace of the Mondragon Corporation, the world's largest worker cooperative, whose foundation was inspired in the 1940s by the Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta. In 2002 the MCC contributed 3.7% to the total GDP of the Basque Country and 7.6% to the industrial GDP.
The valley of the High Deba where the town is located enjoyed a high level of employment in the 1980s while the rest of the Basque industrial areas suffered from the steel crisis.
Noted poverty expert and sociology professor Barbara J. Peters of Stony Brook Southampton has studied the incorporated and entirely resident-owned town of Mondragón. "In Mondragón, I saw no signs of poverty. I saw no signs of extreme wealth," Peters said. "I saw people looking out for each other…. It's a caring form of capitalism."
The spa at Santa Águeda (now a psychiatric hospital) was the location of the 1897 murder of Spanish monarchist politician Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Michele Angiolillo.
Mondragón University
Mondragón serves as base of Mondragón University, a private university created in 1997, that is connected with the MCC companies. Almost all of the university's graduates find their first job within three months after completing their studies due to this strong link.
Mondragón University is divided into engineering, humanities, and enterprise faculties. The faculty of engineering is in Mondragon and Goierri. The humanities faculty is in Eskoriatza and the enterprise faculty is in Bidasoa and Oñati. The student enrollment is approximately 3,500 and is rapidly growing. The majority of the students are from Gipuzkoa and surrounding villages, although in the last few years, the number of students from Bilbao, San Sebastián, and the Basque Country capital, Vitoria-Gasteiz, has increased significantly.
In film
Pierre Boutron's French language film Fiesta!, adapted from a novel written by José Luis de Vilallonga, was set in Mondragón during the Spanish Civil War.

The Flin Flon Museum is a former Canadian National Railway station, opened in 1936. It was located in downtown Flin Flon, Manitoba, and moved to its current location in 1983 to serve as the community museum.
History
The station was located at milepost 87.5, the end of the rail line from The Pas to Flin Flon, along the CNR Flin Flon subdivision. The town also has a grain elevator at the station.
The storey-and-a-half structure is an example of a 2nd Class Canadian National Railway Station, which were built in communities of a notable size. “With its paired tall sash windows, broad cross-gabled hipped roof with deep bellcast eaves supported by decorative brackets, and ornamental half-timbering in the gable front over the office, the station is a fine surviving representative of the type.” It has been designated as Municipal Heritage Site (Number 383), preserved under authority of the provincial Heritage Resources Act, since May 14, 2014 .
The station is a long rectangle "covered by a low-pitched hipped shingled roof, with a gable-roofed crossing wing terminating at the front in a shallow bay with windows on three sides". There is a short rectangular wing to the rear, with the former passenger area to the right and the former baggage and freight handling area to the left of this area. The Canadian Register of Historic Places notes the following features and ornamentation at the station: "the light-painted stucco cladding, the organization of the fenestration: large window openings containing paired tall sash windows divided horizontally into three: a square pane at the top with a larger oblong pane in the middle and small sliding ventilating panes at the bottom, the main passenger doorway at centre right, with freight doors to the left, the contrasting-coloured ornamental half, timbering in the gable front, the deep eaves, supported by large, decorative wooden brackets".

The Monastery of Saint Minas is a former Armenian monastery in eastern Turkey. It's a dome-less basilica with columns (very common for Armenian churches constructed in the 19th century). Located at the western edge of Gezköy village of Erzurum province in Turkey now. The village of Gezköy (formerly known as "Kes") is about 9 km west of the centre of the city of Erzurum.
Etymology
Saint Minas the Martyr and Thaumaturgy is one of the saints of the Armenian-Gregorian church that corresponds to Saint Minas in the other Christian churches. Toponym "Kes" () in Armenian is for "half", which was a former (historical) name of the village of Gezköy, which in Turkish means "eye-village".
History
At the beginning of the 19th century there were some 100 Armenian-populated villages in the Erzurum plain - by the end of the century that number had been reduced to around 50. The brief Russian liberation of parts from the Ottoman Empire during the 1828-29 Russo-Turkish War resulted in an exodus of some 10,000 Armenian families, an estimated 75,000 people, mostly from Erzurum province, who accompanied the withdrawing Russian forces into Russian territory. There was a further flight of the region's native Armenian population into Russian-controlled territory after the Crimean War of 1853-56, and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, when Russian forces again captured Erzurum. In the decade before the 1915 genocide, the village of Kes had 1,103 Armenian inhabitants (comprising 144 households) and 170 Muslim inhabitants. Kes also had a school with 100 students. The village church in Kez was called Surp Minas. It had been built in 1790, but had probably replaced an older building because the date 1740 appeared on a khatchkar set into a wall of the church.
Current condition
The monastery still stands, however in a poor state. An encroaching development may mean it will be destroyed however.

The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina () contains a wide medium blue vertical band on the fly side with a yellow right triangle abutting the band and the top of the flag. The remainder of the flag is medium blue with seven full five-pointed white stars and two half stars top and bottom along the hypotenuse of the triangle.
The three points of the triangle stand for the three main ethnic groups (or "constituent peoples") of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. The triangle represents the approximate shape of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The stars, representing Europe, are meant to be infinite in number and thus they continue from top to bottom. The flag features colors often associated with neutrality and peace – white, blue, and yellow. They are also colors traditionally associated with Bosnian culture and history. The blue background is evocative of the flag of the European Union.
The Bosnian national flag is also used for official purposes by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the constituent entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
History
Bosnian Banate from 1154 until 1377
Used by Stjepan II Kotromanic.
Bosnian Kingdom from 1377 until 1463
The flag of the Kingdom of Bosnia was based on coat of arms of the Bosnian dynasty Kotromanić, king Tvrtko I and their successors. The flag of medieval Bosnia was white with the coat of arms of the Kotromanić dynasty in the middle which consisted of a blue shield with six gold fleur de lys displayed around a white bend.
Western Herzegovina 1760 flag
The green flag with the white crescent and star pointing to the left was used by Bosniak landlords in border parts in southern and western Herzegovina. The flag was most commonly used in wars. It also accompanied the troops of the Eyalet of Bosnia during the second siege of Khotyn in Moldavia. It differs from Ottoman flag by size and direction of crescent, as well as its swallow-shape, similar to some West-European jacks and ensigns.
Bosnian Revolt of 1830s flag
In the 1830s revolt by Husein Gradaščević the green flag with a yellow crescent and star was used. The revolt's aim was for Bosnia to gain autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.
Austro-Hungarian rule
When the Austro-Hungarian Empire annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina the flag was changed. The province of Bosnia used a flag that was red and yellow horizontally, but the province of Herzegovina used the same flag but with reversed colors (yellow and red).
The coat of arms is one of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, Bosnian noble and duke from 14th century. The original medieval coat of arms had a white background and two red stripes in the top of the shield. It was Similar to the old flag of the Western Bosnian Flag.
Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (1942–1946)
After World War II, in 1945, the red star flag became universally official. It was given its final shape by enlarging the star and adding a narrow yellow border. The flag was usually accompanied on official buildings by the flag of the federal republic and the flag of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Because of this, many buildings in former Bosnia and Herzegovina still carry a three-poled flag holder. A smaller version of the flag served as the civil ensign while an elongated banner version was seen flown in front of the Yugoslav parliament.
Yugoslav Period (1946–1992)
While being the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within communist Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav flag stood as a canton, while the rest of the flag was red to symbolise the socialism and communism in Yugoslavia at the time. Bosnia and Herzegovina also had a new coat of arms during Yugoslav rule; it was a symbol of Bosnian industrialism at the time. This flag is similar to the flag of the Soviet Union and the flag of China.
Independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992–1998)
On 3 March 1992 Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. Initially the newly independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to use the flag of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until a new flag was adopted on 20 May 1992.
The flag picked was the arms of the Kings of Bosnia Kotromanić dynasty, who ruled from 1377 until 1463 over the area that is present day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Dalmatia, consisted of a blue shield with six golden lilies displayed around a white bend; the golden lily is the Lilium bosniacum, which is a native lily to the area.
The flag chosen in 1992 has a white background with the Bosnian lily in the center. Though it is no longer an official flag of the state, the flag continues to be used unofficially by Bosniak civilians as a sort of ethnic flag, used at football games, as part of political rallies, and other such events.
Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Dayton Accords
The Bosnian Serbs who lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the signing of the Dayton Agreement viewed the flag with the six fleurs-de-lys as only representing the Bosniaks (i.e. Bosnian Muslims) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The flag of the state was eventually changed into the current, post-1998 flag. The current flag was introduced by the UN High Representative Carlos Westendorp after the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina could not decide on a solution that was acceptable to all parties. Aside from the colors, the current flag contains no historical or other references to the Bosnian state. The flag is rarely ever seen in the Republika Srpska, whose residents prefer to fly either that entity's regional flag or the Serbian national flag instead. Some Bosniaks dislike or have no particular affinity for the flag, preferring the former Bosnian national flag used from 1992 to 1998 (which remains used by some Bosniaks as a sort of ethnic flag), or the former socialist-era Yugoslav flag instead.
Colors scheme
The official colors of the flag are:
Alternative flag versions
The first flag that was proposed in the First Set of Proposals was the "Czech Pattern", similar to the flag of the Czech Republic. It was intended to represent all three constitutive nations living in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The next proposal was the "Laurel branch". It is based on the light blue colour of the United Nations Flag. It would have had a golden olive branch in the middle. The olive branch is taken from the United Nations emblem. The flag would have only one branch. The branch was rotated around 30 degrees counterclockwise. The third proposal was the "Map" proposal. It would also use the United Nations light blue colour; however, there would be the addition of a white outline map of Bosnia and Herzegovina. No official text was ever published specifying the colour of the outline, but it probably would have been white.
The Second Set of Proposals had flags that were truly representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole. The first flag design was a diagonally striped tricolor pattern of red to white to blue (different colors but in the same pattern as the Flag of the Republic of the Congo). In the centre there would be a blue map of Bosnia and Herzegovina outlined in yellow in the middle inside a circle of 10 five-pointed yellow stars. The flag would have been a 1:2 ratio. The second flag proposed was very similar except it had 12 five-pointed stars to represent the European Union. The Flag of Europe has the 12 five-pointed stars. The third design was a bit more different from the first two designs. The diagonal tricolour shape was kept, but the diagonal white stripe was made wider so that the angle was not perfectly 45 degrees. In the center there was a yellow map of Bosnia and Herzegovina outlined in green and under it there were two green olive branches. The olive branch pattern was the same one that the United Nations uses in its flag. The final fourth design was kept the same emblem from the third design, but did not have the diagonal stripes. Instead it had a horizontal tricolour pattern of blue, white, and red (from top to bottom), similar to that of the former Yugoslavia.
The first Westendorp alternative flag was a highly similar one to today's flag, a diagonally divided top-hoist to bottom-fly yellow over light blue flag with line of 9 white five-pointed stars in the light blue field along the diagonal. The only major difference was that the color of the background was UN blue. The second Carlos Westendorp alternative flag is a light blue flag (using the United Nations' flag's colors) with 5 bars interchangeably coming out of hoist and not reaching the other end. The colors are interchangeably yellow and white. In the third alternative flag, the field was light blue and had five narrow yellow bars.
Westendorp's decision ended up being the first alternative flag. However, it was changed slightly to a darker blue, evocative of the European Union's flag.

Saint Clair Cemin (born Cruz Alta, Brazil in 1951) is a postmodern sculptor.
Life and work
Saint Clair Cemin lives and works in New York City and Beijing. Their work encompasses multiple styles, approaches, and materials, from neo-surrealism to furniture to toys in popular culture to the history of sculpture.
Cemin became interested in sculpting as a teenager. Once interested in philosophy and physics, they began to focus their attention on art, drawing and working on illustrations for magazines.
Cemin earned their degree at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, from 1975-1978 where they learned printmaking for three years. They moved to New York City shortly after, where they experimented in several fields as a way of earning an income. From 1981 to 1983, Cemin worked in carpentry renovating lofts in New York, cabinet making, and finally sculpture. The artist's first exhibited sculpture was The Granny Ashtray, which has been described as an anti-modernist piece. Throughout the 1980s, Cemin became an integral part of NY's East Village art scene. Some of their works from this era are on permanent exhibition at important institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. After those formative years in NYC Cemin moved to Egypt and then Paris to pursue sculpture in different environments and with different mediums. After 2010 they returned to NY and continues to create sculptural works in their Brooklyn studio.
In 2012 Saint Clair Cemin had a public exhibition of works along Broadway in Manhattan. Of the several works exhibited on Broadway one "vortex" at the corner of 57th street and Broadway, stood some 40 feet tall.
Publications
In 2005, Richard Milazzo's book on Saint Clair Cemin titled "Saint Clair Cemin: Sculptor from Cruz Alta" was published by Sikkema Jenkins & Co. A book of Saint Clair Cemin's art writings have been published by Edgewise Press titled Fragments of a Mind: Stories and Comments on Art 1987-2004.
Public monuments
In 1990 Saint Clair Cemins' first public sculpture was installed in the town of Reston, Virginia. Since then they have had large public monuments installed throughout the world, including "Open" in Schaumberg, Illinois, "Tree" in Bergen, Norway, "Spring" in Båstads Kommun, Sweden. The monument, "Supercuia", pictured aside, is in Porto Alegre, Brazil and was completed in 2003. They received the Biennial Award from the Ueno Royal Museum and the Hakone Open-Air Museum in Japan in 1995.
Collections
Saint Clair Cemin's work is included in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Fonds National d'Art Contemporain, Paris, France; Emily Fisher Landau Collection, Long Island City, NY; Rooseum, Stockholm, Sweden; Eli Broad Family Foundation, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Inhotim, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The DRG Class E94 is an electric heavy freight locomotive built for Deutsche Reichsbahn from 1940, with the bulk of deliveries taking place in that year. It was a major evolution of the DRG Class E 93. Railway aficionados still call the type "Grünes Krokodil" (Green Crocodile) because of the resemblance to the Swiss locomotive nicknamed "Crocodile".
Production
After World War II, new units were ordered and delivered as late as 1957.
Transfers to ÖBB
After the war, 44 units were placed under the authority of the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). In 1952, the ÖBB ordered three complementary locos. In 1954, they were classified as class 1020.

Gustavo Enrique González López is the former Venezuelan Minister of Popular Power for Interior, Justice and Peace (MPPRIJP) in 2015-2016 and is the current director of the National Intelligence Service (SEBIN).
Career
Gustavo González López graduated from the Military Academy in 1982, with prominent classmates including Bolivar state governor, Francisco Rangel Gómez. Between January and May 1991, Lopez Gonzalez was sent to the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, in Georgia for a "Psychological Operations" and Advanced Officer Training course by the US Army.
Chávez government
López González joined the Venezuelan cabinet in 2006 where they served as president of Metro de Caracas and Los Teques Metro. In December 2008, President Hugo Chávez appointed them commander of the 5th Jungle Infantry Division, Operation Theatre No. 5 and Garrison Ciudad Bolivar. They were made the commanding general of the Bolivarian Militia on 30 July 2011. They also served as secretary of the Security and Intelligence Unit Electric System.
Maduro government
Since 17 February 2014, following the controversial shootings during the 2014 Venezuelan protests in Candelaria which left Bassil Da Costa shot dead, they were appointed Director of Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and president of Strategic Centre for Security and Protection Patria.
González López was one of seven officials that received targeted sanctions by the government of Barack Obama for alleged human rights abuses. Following the announcement of sanctions, González López was promoted to Minister of Popular Power for Interior, Justice and Peace on 15 March 2015 by President Nicolás Maduro, who stated "I have decided to appoint Major General González López Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace to go with their award of the American empire to secure peace in the country, citizen and national security".
On 1 July 2017, President Nicolás Maduro named González López general-in-chief of the Venezuelan army. In 2018, González López allegedly faced scrutiny within the Maduro government following a drone attack targeting Maduro and the death of Fernando Albán Salazar, who died in SEBIN custody at the agency's headquarters. They were subsequently replaced by Manuel Cristopher Figuera.
Following the 2019 Venezuelan uprising against Maduro, which saw SEBIN director Cristopher Figuera participate as a plotter, González López was named Director of SEBIN for the second time by Maduro.
Controversy
Sanctions
González has been sanctioned by several countries.
The U.S. sanctioned González for their role in the 2014 Venezuelan protests. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a presidential order in 2015 declaring Venezuela a "threat to its national security" and ordered the United States Department of the Treasury to freeze property and assets of seven Venezuelan officials. The U.S. held the seven individuals, including González, responsible for "excesses committed in the repression of the demonstrations of February 2014 that left at least 43 dead" including "erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, restrictions on press freedom, violence and human rights abuses in response to anti-government protests, arbitrary arrests and arrests of anti-government protesters, and significant public corruption" according to BBC Mundo.
Canada sanctioned 40 Venezuelan officials, including González, in September 2017. The sanctions were for behaviors that undermined democracy after at least 125 people will kill in the 2017 Venezuelan protests and "in response to the government of Venezuela's deepening descent into dictatorship". Canadians were banned from transactions with the 40 individuals, whose Canadian assets were frozen.
The European Union sanctioned seven Venezuela officials, including González, on 18 January 2018, singling them out as being responsible for deteriorating democracy in the country. The sanctioned individuals were prohibited from entering the nations of the European Union, and their assets were frozen.
In March 2018, Panama sanctioned 55 public officials, including González, and Switzerland implemented sanctions, freezing the assets of seven ministers and high officials, including González, due to human rights violations and deteriorating rule of law and democracy.

The December 2015 Hindu Kush earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.3 in South Asia on 25 December 2015. One woman was killed in Pakistan. At least 100 people were injured in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The quake was also strongly felt in Tajikistan and India. The epicenter of the earthquake was in the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region at a depth of 203.4 km.
Background
An earthquake of 7.3 was felt in the same region in October 2015 causing 398 deaths and 2,536 injuries in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The Himalayan mountains are pushed up by the collision of tectonic plates, making them prone to devastating quakes. An earthquake in April 2015, Nepal's worst in 80 years, killed over 8,600 people.
The last major earthquake in the same region of similar magnitude (7.6 ) was almost ten years prior in October 2005, which resulted in 87,351 deaths, 75,266 injured, 2.8 million people being displaced, and 250,000 farm animals deaths. The notable difference between this earthquake and the 2005 earthquake is the depth of the seismic activity. The 2005 earthquake was 15 km deep while this earthquake was 203.4 km deep, reducing its effects at the surface.
In recent studies, geologists claim that global warming is one of the reasons for increased seismic activity. According to these studies melting glaciers and rising sea levels disturb the balance of pressure on Earth's tectonic plates thus causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes. This could be one of the reasons why the Himalayas are getting more prone to earthquakes in recent years.

Postcards from Leningrad, Spanish title: Postales de Leningrado) is a 2007 Venezuelan film, written and directed by Mariana Rondón. It is a drama about children growing up among guerrilla groups in the 1960s in Venezuela. It was Venezuela's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film of the 80th Academy Awards.
Plot
During the leftist uprising in the 1960s in Venezuela, a young guerrilla-girl, living in secrecy, gives birth to their first daughter during Mother's Day. Due to that, their photos appear on the newspaper, since that moment they would have to run away.
Hidden places, false disguises and names are the daily life of The Girl, the narrator of the story. Alongside their cousin (Teo), they re-live the adventures of their guerrilla parents, building up a labyrinth with superheroes and strategies, in which nobody knows where the reality (or madness) begins. However, these children's game does not hide the deaths, tortures, denunciations and treason within the guerrillas.
The kids want to convert themselves into The Invisible Man, in order to escape from the danger. However, they know that their parents might never come back and therefore, they'll only receive Postcards from Leningrad.

USCGC Stone (WMSL-758) is the ninth of the United States Coast Guard and is expected to be stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.
Development and design
All of Legend-class cutters were constructed by Huntington Ingalls Industries and were part of the Integrated Deepwater System Program. They are of the high endurance cutter roles with additional upgrades to make it more of an asset to the Department of Defense during declared national emergency contingencies. The cutters are armed mainly to take on lightly-armed hostiles in Low-Threat Environments.
Construction and career
Stone was laid down on 14 September 2018, launched on 4 October 2019 by Huntington Ingalls Industries and christened on 29 February 2020. They will be expected to be commissioned in February 2021. Them sea trials took place on 15 September in the Gulf of Mexico and was successfully delivered to the Coast Guard on 10 November 2020.
On 22 December 2020, they left Pascagoula, Mississippi for their first patrol, which was also their shakedown cruise, in the South Atlantic. While in the South Atlantic, they participated Operation Southern Cross which is designed to counter illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing along with strengthening partnerships throughout the region. On January 29, 2021, it was announced that the Stone would not make their scheduled stop in Argentina after visiting Guyana, Brazil, and Uruguay. The crew did not disembark in Montevideo, due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. Before returning home, while off the coast of Guyana they helped to interdict a suspected narcotic trafficker with USCGC Raymond Evans (WPC-1110). Evans took possession of the contraband and the traffickers. The recovered cocaine was estimated to be in excess of 970 kilograms. After recovering the drugs, they continued on their shakedown cruise covered over the course of 68 days before returning home.
Stone was commissioned on 19 March 2021, in their homeport of North Charleston, S.C.

A former editor of the science journal Nature and opinion editor at New Scientist magazine in London, they have written for The Guardian and The Economist.
Marchant writes that "the idea for Decoding the Heavens came about in November 2006, when I was an editor at the science journal Nature. A research paper was due to be published revealing the workings of a sophisticated ancient device called the Antikythera mechanism. The story grabbed me immediately, and I was desperate to find out more about this mysterious contraption. I travelled to Athens to see the remains of the mechanism, and to meet those who have studied it and hear their stories."

Shenton House is a historic building within the grounds of The University of Western Australia in Perth. It is a two-story Georgian style building with surrounding verandas.
Originally called 'Crawley Park House', it is the oldest building on campus, built in 1846 by Henry Charles Sutherland. Sutherland was a surveyor who became Clerk to the Colonial Treasurer, then Secretary to the Executive and Legislative Councils, and later Collector of Inland Revenue and Colonial Treasurer.
It was given to the University in 1914 to accommodate the Department of Mining and Engineering, which occupied it until 1960. Various alterations were made during this period to accommodate teaching requirements. In 1921, the University formally acquired the rough property, including the house, from the family of Sir George Shenton. It was then renamed in their honour.
Since 1988, the building has belonged to the School of Indigenous Studies.
The building is a heritage listed building of both the National Trust of Australia (1997) and the Australian Heritage Council (1998).

Michael Stephen Shackleton is a South African politician who served as a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature from May 2019 to April 2022. Prior to serving in the provincial legislature, they were a Tshwane councillor and a Member of the National Assembly. Formerly a member of the Democratic Alliance, they resigned from the party on 28 April 2022 and joined ActionSA.
Background
Shackleton is from Centurion in Pretoria. Their father died from cancer in 2001 just before they started high school and their mother died of heart failure in 2008, while they were at university. They developed a stutter after the death of their parents.
Shackleton has an LLB from the University of Pretoria and is an advocate. They also hold an LLM degree in constitutional and administrative law, a certificate in provincial and local government law, and a postgraduate certificate in corporate law.
Political career
In 2008 Shackleton joined the Democratic Alliance's student organisation at the University of Pretoria. They then became the leader of the party's student organisation at the university and joined the university's student representative council in 2010. They also graduated from the DA's Young Leaders Programme.
They became a councillor in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in 2014, representing the DA. In July 2018, Shackleton was cited by News24 as one of "100 Young Mandelas" in the category "Resillience".
Shackleton entered the National Assembly, the lower house of the South African parliament, on 11 September 2018 as a replacement for Ian Ollis. During their time in parliament, they were a member of the Standing Committee on Appropriations.
For the 2019 elections, Shackleton was the 20th candidate on the DA's provincial list for the Gauteng Provincial Legislature election.

On 28 April 2022, Shackleton announced in an uploaded video posted on social media that they had resigned as a DA member and therefore as the DA's Gauteng North regional deputy chairperson and as a member of the provincial legislature. They joined ActionSA. Shackleton cited that "the regression of the DA as an inclusive home for all South Africans, and its abandonment of being an electoral alternative to the ANC" and the way the DA treated the community of Ward 96 in Tshwane, of which Shackleton is a resident, as the reasons for their resignation. Shackleton criticised Tshwane mayor Randall Williams and DA leaders Helen Zille and John Steenhuisen for campaigning in ward 96 ahead of the by-election on 4 May 2022 and said that they would "disappear" after the by-election. The DA won the by-election on 4 May.

Aleidis Raiscop (also Reiscop, Raeskop; 1449 in Goch — 15 December 1507 at Rolandswerth monastery) was a German Benedictine monk and a writer.  They are known for their philological and German-Latin translation capabilities.
From a young age they were taught Latin — either at the grammar school in Goch, or at the grammar school in Uedem which was funded by their great-uncle Heinrich Raiscop. They were a pupil to Bruder Benediktus von Maria Laach and at the age of 16 joined the Hagenbusch monastery in Xanten. Later, in 1467, they relocated as a master scholar to the monastery in Rolandswerth (now called Nonnenwerth). On 15 December 1507 they died based at the same monastery.
Influence
During their life they composed seven Latin homilies about Paul the Apostle, translated a German composition about Holy Mass into Latin, and became renowned as a writer of Classics at the monastery. Them particular talent was being able to compose perfect translations of German texts into Latin. Johannes Butzbach, a fellow Classics enthusiast, often praised Aleidis' works highly. Their book from 1505 titled De illustribus mulieribus ("On Distinguished Women") was dedicated to her, in which they compare them to other Benedictine monks such as Hildegard of Bingen.
Raiscop was also one of few nuns in the monastery at the time, and it has been suggested that exemplary skills marked a high point for the perception of nuns at the time. Around this time, nuns began to earn merit for their handicraft works and copying of books.
In 1932 the town of Goch dedicated a street name to Raiscop (but spelled Reiscop) located between Gerbergstraße and Feldstraße.

Jean Victor de Bruijn (25 November 1913 – 12 February 1979) was a Dutch district officer, soldier, explorer, ethnologist and writer. They spent most of their life in the Dutch East Indies, especially in Dutch New Guinea, working as a colonial administrator and an ethnologist. They gained fame for holding out with native Papuan soldiers in mountainous interior of Western New Guinea against overwhelming Japanese forces, as part of Operation Oaktree, maintaining one of the last Dutch-controlled outposts in the Dutch East Indies during World War II.
Early life
Jean Victor de Bruijn, one of a family of eight children, was bom to Dutch parents with some distant Javanese ancestry at the sugar plantation of Mertojoedan, near Magelang, in Java. Their father, Gerard de Bruijn, was the manager of the plantation. They went to the primary and secondary schools there and in Semarang. They wanted to work in the Dutch East Indies administration, which required mandatory courses in Indology, and in 1931 they registered at the University of Leiden, completing their classes in 1935. However, owing to the Great Depression, no further appointments in the colonial administration could be made there, and they had to face two years in the Netherlands on part salary but without occupation. In December 1937, after pursuing further studies directly at the University of Leiden, they left it with a degree of Doctor of literature and Philosophy.
Early career
In January 1938, they came back to the Dutch East Indies. From Batavia, they were appointed Assistant district officer at Saparua in the Molucca Islands, where they remained for eight months, contributing to the construction of roads in order to open up the country. However they were very keen on going and working in New Guinea, and they had asked to be appointed there already back when they still are in the Netherlands. The recent discovery of the Wissel Lakes in December 1936, in the mountainous interior of the island, had made them all the more eager, but the authorities thought them to be far too young for the responsible nature of the work. Nonetheless, and unexpectedly, after only ten months in the service, de Bruijn got their opportunity as the Government became soon aware of their talents. In 1939 they sent them an urgent telegram to fly to Ambon, and from there proceed to take charge of the base at the newly discovered lakes. By that time the base at Enarotali comprised the District Officer and a doctor, a radio operator (both Indonesians), about twenty native police, 120 Papuan coolies, and twenty Javanese convicts and several Christian missionaries. They soon became greatly appreciated among the natives for their fair treatment of the population. They also made several trips to the interior along with botanists and ethnologists who came for the occasion.
Second World War
Most of the Dutch East Indies were invaded by the Japanese in early 1942, soon followed in April 1942 by Dutch New Guinea, thus isolating the post from the coast. Enarotali still maintained contact with Merauke, the last remaining Dutch stronghold in the Dutch East Indies, and with Australia thanks to liaison seaplanes landing on the Paniai lake. Dutch and Australian governments considered evacuating the post, but De Bruijn was determined to stay there and fight the Japanese as well as gather intelligence, in what would be called Operation Oaktree. In July, they went to Australia to plead their case. It was agreed that they would be sent back to the highlands, with rifles and ammunition, but that no further help could be provided for the time being, since few planes were available. In November 1942, a plane set out from Merauke, bringing them back to Enarotali and the highlands.
When they came back to the highlands, they found out that with the absence of authority caused by their departure, the natives had been convinced by the Japanese to report directly to their headquarters in Fakfak, occupied since April 1942. The following month, in December, the Japanese sent two destroyers along the coast south of Enarotali, landing 450 marines at Timoeka near Kaukenau, and started to construct an airfield and a base. De bruijn raided the local police post at Oeta and disarmed the natives who had sided with the Japanese, then withdrew to the mountains. The Japanese, angered by their raid, sent several reconnaissance planes over the lakes. Owing to the sheer numerical superiority of the Japanese, De Bruijn decided on limiting themselves to carrying on intelligence work about Japanese troop movements.
In May 1943, they were made aware that a party of 60 Japanese were coming inland.
At the end of May 1943, the Japanese, determined to occupy the lake regions in order to deny allied planes from landing on the Lake Paniai and catch De Bruijn, turned up at the lakes, only to realize that Enarotali had been burnt to the ground by de Bruijn and their men during their retreat to safety in the surrounding valleys. While in the valleys, thanks to papuans who had worked for the Japanese, they were able to provide precious information to the Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service about Japanese forces stationed at Ambon, Seran, Nabire and Timika. De Bruijn kept a low profile, gathering intelligence and using air drops supplies such as ammunition and rifles, training their men on how to shoot with rifle as well as calling airstrikes on Japanese positions at Enarotali.
During early 1944, they started reinforcing their band of native papuans with rifles and military training, setting up ambushes against Japanese forces in the region, killing dozens of them.
At the same time reports started coming in, saying that more and more Japanese troops were moving toward the mountains, fleeing from their strongholds on the northern coast at Hollandia and Sarmi, which had been invaded by the Americans. They understood that they were facing the risk of getting sandwiched between Japanese troops retreating from the north and the contingent based to the west at Enarotali. In July 1944, De Bruijn decided to evacuate, ending the operations in the highland region.
Over a two-year period, this guerrilla force raided and ambushed Japanese positions, pillaged supplies and destroyed ammunition dumps. Even though the highland lakes region was of little strategic value military speaking, it allowed the gathering of precious information on Japanese positions in the region, which would prove useful during the Western New Guinea campaign. Above all, it was essentially a symbolical victory, as de Bruijn was portrayed as the irreducible symbol of Dutch resistance in the Dutch East Indies by allied and Dutch propaganda, waving the flag and maintaining the prestige of the Dutch among the inhabitants of the area, just as Hermann Detzner had done in German New Guinea 20 years before, and who was a source of inspiration for De Bruijn. They were personally awarded the Netherlands Cross of Merit, the Netherlands Bronze Cross and the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Queen Wilhelmina.
Post-war
Following their evacuation, they stayed for some time in an Australian hospital, being treated for malnutrition, and met their wife Geertje Botma there, also Dutch, who worked as a nurse. Thereafter they went back to New Guinea, to resume their work as the District Officer of Biak Island, between 1946 and 1950. Between 1952 and 1962, they worked in Hollandia, working as an administrative officer and the chief of the demographic bureau, also corresponding with Mary Rockefeller about the disappearance of their son near Agats in 1961, owing to their expertise on the people and the region. In 1963, after the handover of Western New Guinea to Indonesia, they left the island to work as the head of the Urbanisation Research Information Centre of the South Pacific Commission in Noumea, French Caledonia. Eventually in 1965, they came back to the Netherlands and became the head of the Central Office of the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam, until their retirement in 1972.
In 1978 they published a book, called "Het verdwenen volk" (The Vanished Nation), one of the first of its kind about the issues relating to the handover of Western New Guinea to Indonesia, and the risks posed for the local cultures on the region, such as the "Indonesianization", which would be the trigger point of the Papua conflict opposing the Free Papua Movement and the Indonesian government.
They died on 12 February 1979, at the age of 65 in Driebergen, Netherlands.

Chalcosoma engganensis is a large (35–60 mm) and heavy beetle, but anything less than the other Chalcosoma species. The body is shiny black. The male has a sharp horn (directed obliquely upward and forward) on the head. On each side of pronotum there are curved, forward directed horns. Across the head there is a short but powerful spike. This species differs from the normally developed specimens of the other Chalcosoma species in that horns are shorter, male can look a lot like small copies of Chalcosoma moellenkampi. The female lacks these horns and spikes, and is smaller.

Huyshe Wolcott Yeatman-Biggs (2 February 1845 – 14 April 1922), until 1898 known as Huyshe Wolcott Yeatman, was an influential Church of England clergyman who served as the only Bishop of Southwark to be a suffragan bishop (in the Diocese of Rochester), the 105th Bishop of Worcester and, latterly, as the inaugural bishop of the restored see of Coventry in the modern era.
Yeatman was born at Manston House, Dorset, the younger son of Harry Farr Yeatman JP by their marriage to Emma, daughter and heiress of Harry Biggs, of Stockton House, Wiltshire. They were educated at Winchester College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where they were a Dixie Scholar, and eventually (1905) an Honorary Fellow. They were ordained in 1869 and after a curacy in Salisbury became chaplain to the bishop in 1875. That same year they married firstly Lady Barbara Legge, daughter of the 4th Earl of Dartmouth.
They were successively vicar of Netherbury and Sydenham before becoming Bishop of Southwark (a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Rochester) in 1891. They were consecrated a bishop at St Paul's Cathedral on 29 September 1891, by Edward Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury. They were to hold that See for fourteen years before appointment as diocesan Bishop of Worcester in 1905. During their years there Yeatman-Biggs forged very close links with the Episcopal church in the United States. In 1898, they inherited the estate of their brother, Arthur Godolphin Yeatman-Biggs , and (as heir of their maternal grandfather) assumed the additional name of Biggs by Royal licence dates 6 August 1898.
In 1914 Yeatman-Biggs paid for the erection of the King's Stag Memorial Chapel in memory of their wife, who died in 1909.
During the Great War, Yeatman-Biggs put the whole of their official residence, Hartlebury Castle, ‘at the disposal of wounded soldiers' They praised clergy not just for undertaking spiritual work in the War but also for labouring in the fields, in offices and in schools. They stayed in Coventry in July, 1917, and noted the influx of munitions workers including 7000 women working in one factory. At the end of the War they made it clear that those who had been killed should be honoured equally. ‘ I wish it could be agreed in every parish that, as far as the War is concerned, comradeship should be observed, that there should be no individual tablets, but that one memorial, outside or in, should be agreed on for the whole company of our faithful boys, with equal inscriptions, the richer friends bearing the greater cost, but claiming no advantage'.
In 1918 they took on the task of reviving the Diocese of Coventry, during which time they came to national prominence when an unscrupulous adventurer accused them of influencing a vulnerable pensioner into leaving them their assets. Not only were the charges completely unfounded, the much smaller sum they had received was quite properly re-distributed to worthy Anglican causes.
After Yeatman-Biggs's death, a bronze effigy of them was commissioned from Hamo Thornycroft, and was the only artefact to survive more or less intact the bombing of Coventry Cathedral in 1940.

After their term of service Carrington settled at Maidstone, Kent, where for five years they taught a public school. In 1809, with support from friends, they established a private academy at Plymouth Dock, which they then ran until six months before their death, 2 September 1830.
Works
At an early period of their life Carrington, who was a member of The Plymouth Institution (now The Plymouth Athenaeum), began to contribute verse to London and provincial papers. Their poems are mainly descriptive of the scenery and traditions of Devon. In 1820 they published The Banks of the Tamar, and in 1826 Dartmoor. Their collected poems, with a memoir, appeared in two volumes in 1831.
Family
The journalist Frederick George Carrington was their third son.

Ross Pass () is a narrow but well-defined pass between the southeast end of the Allardyce Range and the northwest end of the Salvesen Range in South Georgia. The pass is 610 m high and provides a sledging route between Ross Glacier and Brogger Glacier. It was first mapped in 1882-83 by the German group of the International Polar Year Investigations who referred to it as "Gletscher-Joch" (meaning glacier yoke). The name Ross Pass, which derives from association with nearby Ross Glacier, was given by the SGS following their survey of 1951–52.

Yobi, the Five Tailed Fox () is a 2007 animated Korean film by Lee Sung-gang, the director of My Beautiful Girl, Mari. The film loosely draws upon the Korean folk tales of the kumiho.
Story
One hundred years ago, aliens landed on a mountain near where a small, white five-tailed fox lived. After being stranded on Earth for one hundred years, they are ready for a test flight to see if they can return home. The test fails as one of the aliens makes a mistake, and the other aliens tell them to leave.
The runaway alien finds itself taken in by a class of students at the foot of the mountain. There, a teacher named Kang trains students who do not fit in at a regular school. In order to save the alien, the five-tailed fox takes on the form of a human girl, and joins the school under the name of Yobi.
Staying at the school, Yobi becomes friends with one of the students, a boy named Geum-ee. They grow more and more attached to humans and enjoys their time with them, until a fox hunter appears, as well as a shadow detective named Mr. Shadow who gives Yobi a device which will allow them to become human by taking the soul from a human.
Yobi becomes exposed to the hunter, which makes them leave. With the fox hunter set upon hunting them down, Geum-ee tries to save her, but falls down in a lake which makes Geum-ee's soul trapped in a cage as a bird. Yobi tries to save him, but Mr. Shadow takes Geum-ee's soul. They state that their soul was taken from them long ago and that they need one to become solid. Yobi defeats the shadow, grabbing the soul from their core whilst getting attacked in the soul lake.
Since they fell into the soul lake, Geum-ee crosses the dimension only to be told by the soul lake's gatekeepers that the number of souls in the lake must remain the same, and a soul can never go out unless another soul replaces it. Yobi then allows for Geum-ee's departure back to the human world by placing their own soul in the bird cage. Once they come back to consciousness, Geum-ee tries to call for Yobi, but to no avail.  They are last seen leaving with the teacher and the other students.
Some time later, Yobi's soul is released. Yobi becomes human and is most likely reincarnated to become human not too long after their soul had been exchanged. It is unknown if Yobi and Geum-ee see each other again or not.

Marian Geszke (born 3 September 1943) is a retired Polish football manager.
Early years
Geszke was born in Pinsk, which before World War II was part of Poland. At the time of their birth however Pinsk had been a part of the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Poland, and the incorporation of Eastern Poland into the USSR. After the war Geszke and their family were sent to the modern day Poland, initially being sent to Chełm before being redirected to Sopot which is where the family settled.
Managerial career
In total Geszke managed all three big teams in the Tricity, Lechia Gdańsk, Bałtyk Gdynia and Arka Gdynia. Their first managerial appointment was with Bałtyk Gdynia in 1970, before joining Stoczniowiec Gdańsk for 3 years, and then eventually ended up at Lechia Gdańsk in 1976. Geszke had various short spells at many different clubs, including ŁKS Łódź, Zawisza Bydgoszcz, as well as Lechia Gdańsk and Bałtyk Gdynia again for a second time. In 1995 they moved to the United States and joined up with a Polish club in Chicago, Cracovia Chicago. Despite not initially staying in the US for long, as they rejoined Lechia for a third time and then had a short spell with Arka Gdynia, they moved back to Chicago and spent the next 5 years there. In 2000 they came back to Poland to manage Bałtyk Gdynia for the third time, a position they held until 2001. In 2004 Geszke joined Wigry Suwałki before having their last two spells in management before their retirement, both with Cartusia Kartuzy.

SS Chulmleigh was a British merchant ship of the mid-20th century. They were in service during the first years of the Second World War and was lost on the Kola Run in November 1942. Them crew underwent a 6-week ordeal before being rescued; only the master and eight crewmen survived.
Construction
Chulmleigh was built in 1938 by William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd. of Southwick for the Dulverton Steamship Co., one of WJ Tatem's companies, and was intended for the movement of general cargo. They were 430 ft in length, with a capacity of 5,445 GRT and powered by a triple-expansion steam engine fed by two single-ended boilers, giving a maximum speed of 10.5 knots. They had a single deck, with a shelter deck and a cruiser stern. Chulmleigh was launched on 8 December 1937 and was completed in May 1938.
Service history
Chulmleigh entered service in 1938 with Dulverton but was later transferred to Atlantic Shipping & Trading Co., another of Tatem's companies. The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 found them at Colón, Panama, having completed a voyage to British Columbia and was returning to the UK via the Caribbean. Following their return they undertook several long-haul voyages over the next two years.
In October 1939 they departed the UK, travelling with convoy OB 27 until dispersal for ports in South America; they returned in January 1940 with SL 18.
After several coastal journeys they left the UK in March 1940 with OB 107 for North America, returning with HX 34 in April.
In May 1940 Chulmleigh left with OB 155, joining OG 31 for West Africa and the South Atlantic, before arriving in Australia in August. They returned via the Cape and West Africa, joining SL 62 for passage back to the UK, and arriving in February 1941.
In April 1941 they left the UK for West Africa with OB 308, returning with SL 77 in June.
In August, while with ON 6 Chulmleigh was involved in a collision; after repairs they departed with ON 19, for North America. They returned with SC 54 en route to Iceland with Lend-Lease cargo for the Soviet Union.
In November 1941 they sailed with PQ 5 for Archangel, remaining ice-bound there throughout the winter. After the thaw Chulmleigh sailed for home with QP13 in June 1942.
In September 1942 Chulmleigh returned to Iceland for further passage to the Soviet Union. After the cancellation of PQ 19 due to the demands of Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of North Africa) and the PQ 17 disaster, they were selected for independent passage to Murmansk under Operation FB.
Fate
Chulmleigh left Iceland on 30 October 1942, heading north for the Barents Sea and taking advantage of the polar night but ran aground on 6 November at South Cape, on the main island of Spitzbergen. Unable to refloat and disabled by bombing, they were abandoned, their 58 strong crew setting off in three boats for Barentsburg, which was held by a Free Norwegian garrison.
Barentsburg lay in Isfjorden on the west coast, to the north. One boat was abandoned and the occupants crammed aboard the remaining two, 28 men in one and 29 in the other. The boats separated in the dark but continued north during 7 November. A storm began on 8 November, the crews began to experience hypothermia and one man died on 10 November. The survivors sighted land and at on 12 November and one boat crew got ashore in Isfjorden. Several attempts to raise the alarm failed in the winter blizzards and the crew were only discovered on 2 January 1943, by two Norwegian ski troops of the Barentsburg garrison. The captain and eight surviving crew were repatriated from Barentsburg, only from the landfall, to Thurso on 15 June.
Chulmleigh was later dispatched by U-625, whose commander was credited with their destruction.
The remains of the ship were used as a navigation fix by aircraft and were still visible in 2004.

Camp Tarawa was a training camp located on Hawaiʻi Island constructed and used by the 2nd Marine Division during World War II. The grounds of the camp were situated between the volcanic peak of Mauna Kea and Kohala mountain. Marines were sent straight from the bloody Battle of Tarawa to the campsite, which they had to build themselves. It was well known for its harsh and dusty conditions by Marines who trained there. After the 2d Marine Division left for Saipan, the 5th Marine Division moved into the base and trained for the Battle of Iwo Jima. The base was closed for good in November 1945.
The base was chosen by Marine commanders because the colder climate was beneficial to Marines still suffering with malaria symptoms from the Guadalcanal Campaign, the nearby Parker Ranges were excellent training areas, the leadership knew that the Marines' next fight would be in mountainous terrain and the relative isolation of the camp gave the Marines time to adjust to the people of Hawaii after their brutal fight at Tarawa.
A small memorial can be viewed by the side of the Māmalahoa Highway.
It was located on the grounds of Parker Ranch, just outside the town of Waimea.
In the 1950s a new training center was located further inland and became the Pohakuloa Training Area.

The red-naped trogon (Harpactes kasumba) is a species of bird in the family Trogonidae. It is found in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.
Name in different languages
Latin - Harpactes kasumba
French – Couroucou a masque rouge
German – Rotnacken-Trogon
Spanish – Trogon kasumba
Dutch - Roodnektrogon
Life history
The red-naped trogon was discovered in 1822 by Sir Stamford Raffles, a military and British naturalist (1781-1826) best known for having founded Singapore in 1817.
Morphology and flight
The red-naped trogon is a strongly sexually dimorphic species, with the females generally being duller than the males. The male red-naped trogon is physically defined by a black head and upper breast, blue bill and eye ring with a bright blue coloured face. They have yellow-brown upperparts and upper tail with black outlines, a white breast-line, bright red underparts and the under-tail is black and white. The most defining physical characteristic of the red-naped trogon is a band of bright red feathers around the back of the head, which gives the species its name. The females are blander in colour than the males, consisting of a grey-brown head and upper breast with yellow underparts.
Both the males and females grow in height up to 32 centimetres, or 12.5 inches. They have a life span of approximately 7.3 years. Their legs and feet are short and weak which makes them unable to walk, instead they are limited to the occasional shuffle along a branch. The ratio of leg muscle to body weight in all Trogonidae species is only 3%, the lowest known ratio of any bird. The arrangement of the toes on Trogonidae species feet is also unique among birds and are arranged with the third and fourth toes projecting forward and the first and second toes projecting backwards, an arrangement known as heterodactylous. Because of this arrangement, the red-naped trogon is unable to turn around on a branch if its wings are not aiding the movement.
They have compact bodies, short wings and a long tail. Though the wings are short, they are quite strong, with the wing muscle ratio being approximately 22% of the body weight. In spite of their strength of flight, red-naped trogons do not fly great distances, generally flying no more than a few hundred metres at a time.
Behaviour
Red-naped trogons are generally inactive outside of their regular feeding patterns. Because of this, birdwatchers and biologists have noted that “apart from their general beauty, they are notorious for their lack of other immediately engaging qualities”. Their lack of activity has been considered a defence against predation. As with other Trogonidae species, red-naped trogons have been reported to shift along branches to keep their dull coloured backs turned towards observers, while their heads, which can rotate at 180 degrees like owls, are turned to keep watch on any potential predators. They are preyed upon by hawks and predatory mammals.
Diet and feeding
The red-naped trogon is mainly insectivorous, feasting on arthropods with a preference for stick insects and spiders. This regime is embellished with small lizards, fruits and seeds. The word “Trogon” is Greek for “to gnaw or eat” and refers to the structure and function of their beaks. The cutting edges of the maxilla and mandible are serrated which aids in securing live prey and fruit. These serrations, along with the decurved tip of the bill, are also useful in cutting food items into smaller pieces. Prey is mostly obtained on the wing, with the most commonly used foraging technique known as sally-glean flight. This is where the red-naped trogon flies from an observation perch to a target on another perch or in the foliage. Once in position, the red-naped trogon hovers over its target before snatching up they prey and returning to its original perch to consume the prey.
Call
The red-naped trogon's song voice is a slow, sad-sounding five to eight note “pau pau pau pau pau.” Each short note slightly down slurred (1.5-1.2 kHz) and delivered at a rate of c.1 note/s. In addition to the territorial and breeding calls given by males and females during the breeding seasons, red-naped trogons have also been recorded as having aggression and alarm calls.
Breeding
The red-naped trogon is a territorial and monogamous species. The males repel other members of the same species, and even other nesting species, from around their nesting sites to ensure the safety of the nest. The males attract females by singing. Flocks of 3-12 individuals have been observed prior to, and sometimes during the breeding season, calling and chasing each other, however, the function of these flocks is unknown.
Little is known about the nesting habits of the red-naped trogon, only that they are assumed to be cavity nesters. The only recorded account of a red-naped trogon nest was that of a brood found in July 1976 in Peninsular Malaysia. The nest was dug in a cavity of a rotten stump a few meters off the ground. They produce a clutch size of between one and three eggs. The incubation period lasts between 16 and 19 days. Upon hatching, the chicks are altricial, blind and naked, however, they do acquire feathers rapidly. The nesting period generally takes between 16 and 23 days to fledge.
Distribution and population
The red-naped trogon is presumed to be a permanent resident or sedentary bird. Sedentary is “commonly used in the special sense of ‘non-migratory,'” and resident is defined as “remaining throughout the year in the area under reference”. At least 4,000 species of bird are regular migrants, which is approximately 40 percentage of the world's population of birds, however the red-napped trogon is not one of these. It does not migrate, but instead remains in the same location all year round.
Red-naped trogons are confined to the Sundaic regions lowlands, also known as Sundaland, with a distribution size of 989,000 km2. The Sundaic lowlands is a biogeographical region of South-eastern Asia which encompasses the Sunda shelf, Malay Peninsula of the Asian mainland, and the large islands of Borneo, Java and Sumatra, including their surrounding islands. The eastern boundary of the Sundaic region is the Wallace Line which separates the Indomalaya and Australasia ecotones.
The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as rare in Thailand, fairly common in Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra, rather scarce in Sarawak and uncommon in Singapore, Indonesia, Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei. The current population trend shows a decline in the number of red-naped trogons at a moderately rapid rate, owing to habitat loss and degradation throughout its distribution range.
Number of mature individuals = unknown
Extreme population fluctuations = no
Continuing decline of mature individuals = yes
Population severely fragmented = no
All individuals in one subpopulation = no
Continuing decline in subpopulations = unknown
Extreme population fluctuations in subpopulations = no
Ecology
The red-naped trogon occurs mainly in primary, or lightly logged, lowland evergreen forests. They are most abundant below 600 metres, but have been located occasionally up to 1,200 metres in montane dipterocarp forest in Borneo. Another location that they have been recorded in is peat-swamp forest, as well as some logged areas, thick bamboo groves, coconut and cocoa plantations.
Threats
High rates of deforestation in the Sundaic lowlands have been extremely rapid, owing to the escalation of illegal logging and land conversion that targets all remaining stands of valuable timber. Another impact has also been forest fires that have had a severely damaging effect. Because of these threats, the red-naped trogon has been ranked by Birdlife as a near threatened species (NT).
IUCN Red List History:
2012= Near Threatened
2008= Near Threatened
2004= Near Threatened
2000= Low Risk/Near Threatened
1994= Lower Risk/The Least Concern
1988= Lower Risk/The Least concern
Conservation actions
There are currently no targeted conservation actions for this species, however, conservation actions have been proposed to conduct ecological studies to improve the understanding of the red-naped trogon's habitat requirements. In particular, the studies would aim to determine the levels of tolerance of secondary habitats.
Other conservation actions to be looked into are the improvement of management of protect areas within the species range, to increase the area of suitable habitat and the implement measures to ensure the protection of the suitable habitat from illegal activities.

Distant Music (foaled 3 February 1997) is an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Bred and owned by Khalid Abdullah they were trained throughout their racing career in England by Barry Hills. As a two-year-old in 1999 they were unbeaten in three races including the Champagne Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes and was the top-rated British-trained juvenile of the season. They began 2000 as the favourite for the 2000 Guineas but after losing their unbeaten record in the Greenham Stakes they were well-beaten in the Newmarket classic. Later in the year they won the Park Stakes and finished third in the Champion Stakes. They failed to reproduce their best form as a four-year-old but did add one more important victory in the Goffs International Stakes. They later stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland, Australia, England and Germany but had no success as a sire of major winners.
Background
Distant Music is a bay horse with a white sock on their right hind leg, bred in Kentucky by Juddmonte Farms, the breeding organisation of their owner Khalid Abdullah. The colt was sent to race in Europe and was trained throughout their career by Barry Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire and was ridden in the first half of their racing career by Hills' son Michael.
They were from the first crop of foals sired by Abdulah's stallion Distant View who won the Sussex Stakes in 1994. Distant View's other foals have included Observatory and Sightseek. Distant Music's dam Musicanti raced in France and the United States, winning one of their twelve races. They were a granddaughter of Sister Shannon, an American broodmare who produced Temperence Hill and was also the female-line ancestor of Vanlandingham and Funny Moon (CCA Oaks).
Racing career
1999: two-year-old season
Distant Music began their racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 28 July in which they started the 8/11 favourite against seven opponents. They started slowly but took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won "very easily" by four lengths from Eternal Spring with Best of the Bests (later to win the Prix d'Ispahan) in third. The colt was then stepped up in class for the Group Two Champagne Stakes over the same course and distance on 10 September. They were made the 13/8 favourite in a six-runner field with their main rivals appearing to be Ekraar (winner of the Vintage Stakes) and Rossini (Prix Robert Papin). After being restrained by Michael Hills in the early stages they overtook Rossini a furlong and a half from the finish and won in "impressive" style by two and a half lengths. Barry Hills commented "I was very impressed. If anything, they got there a bit too soon, but they have a very good turn of foot... yesterday they had a seedy toe – a corn – on their near-fore and was slightly lame. It was poulticed and I told my vet the horse would only travel if they thought they were 100 per cent. They didn't travel up here until this morning and it was only at half past six that we took the decision to run him".
On their final appearance of the season, Distant Music contested Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 16 October. They were made the 4/6 favourite ahead of King's Best, a colt who had won the Acomb Stakes on their previous start. The other three runners were the unbeaten Port Vila, and the Aidan O'Brien-trained pair Brahms (third in the Middle Park Stakes) and Zentsov Street. Distant Music was held up by Hills in the early stages as Zentsov Street set the pace from Brahms before moving up and taking the lead approaching the final furlong. They were pushed out by Hills in the closing stages to defeat Brahms by a length. After the race Barry Hills said "He was very impressive when they quickened up at Doncaster on their previous start and they were very impressive at one stage yesterday. They got by them very quickly, but they would have been even better on better ground. I would like to see them in a strongly run race on ground a bit truer than it was at Newmarket. Then we should see a better horse."
During the winter of 1999/2000 Distant Music was the ante-post favourite for the 2000 Guineas.
2000: three-year-old season
Distant Music began their second season in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial of the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April. They recovered from a slow start to the lead inside the final furlong but was caught in the last stride and beaten a head by Barathea Guest. Despite their defeat they started 11/2 second favourite for the 2000 Guineas on 6 May but finished eighth of the twenty-seven runners behind King's Best.
After a break of four months, Distant Music returned in the Group Three Park Stakes at Doncaster on 7 September. They started the 4/1 third favourite behind the four-year-old Swallow Flight, a Listed race winner who had finished third in the Queen Anne Stakes. The other three runners were Barathea Guest, Valentino (runner-up in the St James's Palace Stakes) and Cape Town (third in the Irish 2,000 Guineas). They were held up by Hills in the early stages before beginning to make progress in the last quarter mile. They took the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by a neck from Valentino. Khalid Abdullah's racing manager Teddy Beckett commented "There has been nothing physically wrong with Distant Music, but they just aren't right and it was a question of giving them as much time as they needed to come back to form. Barry Hills has done a marvellous job with him". On 14 October Distant Music was stepped up in class and distance and started a 20/1 outsider for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket. After being held-up towards the rear of the fifteen-runner field they stayed on steadily in the closing stages to finish third behind Kalanisi and Montjeu. For their final appearance of 2000, Distant Music was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs on 4 November. Ridden by the American jockey Corey Nakatani they were outpaced from the start and finished tenth of the fourteen runners behind War Chant.
2001: four-year-old season
Richard Hughes took over from Michael Hills as Distant Music's regular jockey in 2001. On their seasonal debut they started joint favourite for the Earl of Sefton Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April and finished fourth of the six runners behind the seven-year-old Right Wing. In July the colt was sent to Ireland for the Goffs International Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse and started the 5/4 favourite in a three-runner field. Their two opponents were the three-year-old Bonnard (third in the Grand Prix de Paris) and the four-year-old Muakaad (Mooresbridge Stakes). In a change of tactics they led from the start and rallied after being briefly headed by Bonnard two furlongs out. They regained the lead and won "comfortably" by one and a half lengths from Muakaad, being eased down by Hughes in the final strides.
Distant Music failed to win or place in their four remaining races. They finished fifth to Noverre in the Sussex Stakes and fifth again behind Sakhee in the International Stakes at York. In September they attempted to repeat their 2000 victory in the Park Stakes but finished sixth of the eight runners behind Tough Speed. On their final start they were resunited with Michael Hills for the Champion Stakes and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind Nayef.
Assessment
When the International Classifiaction for the two-year-old on 1999 was released in January 2000, Distant Music was rated the best British-trained colt, five pounds behind the Irish champion Fasliyev and level with Giant's Causeway.
Michael Hills described Distant Music as "the best two-year-old I've ridden".
Stud record
After their retirement from racing, Distant Music became a breeding stallion at the Morristown Lattin Stud in County Kildare. They also stood at the Yallambee Stud in Victoria, Australia before being transferred to the Hedgeholme Stud in County Durham in 2007. They were subsequently moved to Germany where they were based at the Gestut Helenenhof. They sired numerous minor winners but none of any major significance. The best of their offspring was probably Barongo, who won four races in France.

All the King's Men is a 2006 American political drama film written, directed and produced by Steven Zaillian based on the 1946 Pulitzer Prize–winning novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren. All the King's Men had previously been adapted into a Best Picture Oscar–winning film by writer-director Robert Rossen in 1949. The film narrates the rise to power and dramatic demise of the ruthless Governor Willie Stark (played by Sean Penn), taking their office in the American South. The fictional character is loosely based on the life of Louisiana governor Huey Long, in office between 1928 through 1932. Elected as a U.S. senator, they were assassinated in 1935. The film co-stars Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley.
Plot
Jack Burden, a Louisiana news reporter, takes a personal interest in Willie Stark, an idealistic small-town lawyer and parish treasurer. Circumstances develop that result in Tiny Duffy, a local political leader Burden knows, urging Stark to run for governor. Burden's upbringing makes them familiar with the undercurrent of politics – they were raised by their loving godfather Judge Irwin, a former state attorney general, while their good friend, Dr. Adam Stanton, and their sister Anne Stanton—also Burden's former lover—are the children of a former governor. Burden therefore decides to take Duffy's advice and travels as a reporter on Stark's campaign for governor.
The politically astute Burden soon deduces, and Duffy strategist (and Stark mistress) Sadie Burke confirms, that Duffy is using Stark to split their party's vote and thus allow the opposing party to win. They tell Stark, who begins to give speeches in a straightforward manner to appeal to the public, in defiance of the advice given to them by Duffy. Their vigorous strategy attacks the corruption of the existing players and promises schools and roads for their "fellow ignorant hicks", resulting in Stark winning the election. They manage Duffy by making them their lieutenant governor. Stark recruits Burden to work for them as an adviser.
Stark proves to be a very persuasive governor, delivering on many of their new projects. Irwin disapproves of Stark and publicly supports an investigation of possible graft in the new spending. Burden points out that graft is the elite's word for what the previous politicians had always done, while Stark openly tells their crowds that their "crooks, unlike theirs, are itty bitty" compared to the elite's. Stark convinces Stanton to head a new public hospital while they begin having an affair with Anne, provoking Burke's jealousy and Burden's disappointment.
Irwin continues criticizing Stark as political controversies begin to unfold. Stark demands that Burden seek information on the judge to be used against him. Jack insists that there is no such information, but eventually discovers evidence of a bribe that Irwin used to get their appointment many years prior, leading an opponent to commit suicide. Following this revelation, Irwin themselves commits suicide. Burden's mother then tells them that Irwin treated them with such love because they were their biological father, which causes a great amount of guilt for Burden.
Stark utilizes many methods of corruption to consolidate their power, including patronage and intimidation. Adam is told that Stark is using the hospital project to rob the state and is framing them in the process. Burden and Anne both assure Adam that this is false. Adam also becomes enraged when they learn of Stark's affair with their sister. Adam waits at the state capitol and assassinates Stark, only to be immediately killed by the governor's bodyguard. It is later revealed that Adam was influenced by Duffy and Burke to murder Stark, allowing Duffy to succeed Stark as governor.
Cast
Production
Filming took place in New Orleans, Morgan City, Donaldsonville, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge and many other places in Louisiana.
The film garnered strong Oscar "buzz" and was considered a contender by Entertainment Weekly even before its initial opening.
The world premiere was held at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2006, where the film was first screened to the press. A special screening was held at the Tulane University in New Orleans on September 16, 2006.
Reception
Box office
All the King's Men grossed $7.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $9.5 million, against a production budget of $50 million.
In the film's opening weekend it made $3.7 million from 1,514 theaters, finishing seventh. It then dropped to 11th place with a gross of $1.5 million in its second weekend, and by its third weekend fell to 27th place with $285,993.
Critical response
In spite of its high-profile cast, direction and production team, All the King's Men was a massive failure, both with critics and at the box office. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds approval rating of 11% based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 4.30/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "With a scenery-chewing performance from Sean Penn, an absence of political insight, and an overall lack of narrative cohesiveness, these Men give Oscar bait a bad name." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".
A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed disappointment with the film: "Nothing in the picture works. It is both overwrought and tedious, its complicated narrative bogging down in lyrical voiceover, long flashbacks and endless expository conversations between people speaking radically incompatible accents." Michael Medved gave All the King's Men two stars (out of four) calling it "depressing and disappointing", a "stodgy melodrama" and a "pointless, pretentious, plodding period-piece".
Richard Roeper also gave the remake a less than stellar review. Michael Phillips put it on their Worst of 2006 list.
Some reviews were positive. Richard Schickel of Time magazine liked the movie, arguing that "it's much more faithful to the tone of the novel" than the original. Kenneth Turan (Los Angeles Times) praised the film's "undeniable moral seriousness" and the actors' "exceptional ensemble work." They argued that Zaillian's script and direction "expertly extracted the core of this greatest of American political novels, a work that is both of its time and outside it."
Aftermath
The film was featured in Nathan Rabin's ongoing feature for The Onion's A.V. Club, My Year of Flops. Of three categories (failure, fiasco, or secret success), they labeled All the King's Men as a failure and said of the film: "Zaillian's dud manages the formidable feat of being at once histrionic and agonizingly dull, hysterically over-the-top yet strangely lifeless."
Zaillian was stunned by the poor critical and box-office results of this film, which opened with only $3.8 million and barely made $7.2 million at the end of its run in US theaters. Another new wide release from the same weekend, the sequel Jackass Number Two, made $28.1 million. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Zaillian said that the film's poor performance was "like getting hit by a truck. ... I don't know what to make of it. ... We're all a bit shellshocked. I feel like Huey Long must have felt -- you try to do good and they shoot you for it."

The Kakhaberidze, archaically Kakhaberisdze (pl. -ebi) (, literally "the sons of Kakhaber") was a noble family in medieval Georgia which held sway over the highland northwestern Georgian province of Racha from the 11th or 12th century to the 13th. The Kakhaberidze were a branch of the Liparitid-Baguashi, their dynastic name being derived from its early member Kakhaber known from a few inscriptions from Racha.
By 1184, when Queen Tamar of Georgia ascended the throne, the Kakhaberidze had been in possession of both Racha and the neighboring district of Takveri, bearing the title of "Duke of Dukes" (eristavt-eristavi). Kakhaber (II) Kakhaberidze was the one who, together with Archbishop Anton of Kutaisi, placed the crown upon Tamar's brow at a ceremony held at the Gelati Monastery. Their descendant and probably a grandson, Kakhaber (III), was powerful enough to defy the royal authority and play King David VI and their Mongol overlords against one another. By c. 1278, Kakhaber had been defeated, blinded and exiled at the king's order. Their possessions were turned over to the crown. The Kakhaberidze seem to have retained themselves in Racha into the early 15th century, but then went in obscurity. Their descendants, the house of Chichua (ჩიჩუა) became a prominent family in the western Georgian region of Mingrelia while the house of Chijavadze (ჩიჯავაძე) (another branch of Kakhaberidze), continued to play an important role in the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti and both noble houses were confirmed as the princes (knyaz) under the Russian rule in the 19th century.

Floyd Leroy Williams (born September 20, 1939) is a North American mathematician well known for their work in Lie theory and, most recently, mathematical physics. In addition to Lie theory, their research interests are in homological algebra and the mathematics of quantum mechanics. They received their B.S.(1962) in Mathematics from Lincoln University of Missouri, and later their M.S.(1965) and Ph.D.(1972) from Washington University in St. Louis. Williams was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1984, and has been professor emeritus since 2005. Williams' accomplishments earned them recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2019 Honoree.
Biographical Sketch
Floyd Williams was born on September 20, 1939, and lived in Kansas City, Missouri. They were raised in extreme poverty. Their mother told them not to complain about their situation, but rather to have faith in God and work hard. Them advice was taken, and it worked. They eventually are ordained in addition to being a mathematician.
However, it was music, not mathematics, that appealed to them through high school. "In fact," they admit, "mathematics was the only course in which I did not do well." Williams had not thought of going to college until their last week in high school when they were offered a music scholarship at Lincoln University of Missouri in Jefferson City, Missouri.
It was in their sophomore year that they became intrigued by the theory of relativity, which turned out to be their main motivation for studying mathematics. In 1972 they completed their Ph.D. from Washington University where their thesis was in the field of Lie theory. They were an instructor and lecturer at MIT from 1972–1975, before moving to the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor in 1975. In 1983 they received an MRI grant to continuing researching in this field, ushering them into the mainstream of mathematics.
As an African-American in a field that has had little minority representation, Williams has felt the sting of discrimination during their career. However, they have been a motivation and role model for many young minorities, encouraging them to enter science and engineering. Williams has helped to set up programs that allow pre-college students and undergraduates to meet and talk with mathematicians, scientists and engineers, most notably at a summer camp run at MIT. "All that many of these youngsters see is different courses," they say, "but they want to know what mathematicians do from 8 am to 5 pm. Once minorities commit to graduate work in science or engineering," they continue, "they need extra help and support for what, for many, is the foreign environment of graduate school. Such programs exist at few universities, but we need more of them."
In 2012 they became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
Mathematics
Williams' recent contribution to quantum mechanics has been in the area of Nikiforov-Uvarov theory of generalized hypergeometric differential equation, used to solve the Schrödinger equation and to obtain the quantization of energies from a single unified point of view. This theory is developed and is also used to give a uniform approach to the theory of special functions. This study furthers to connect the modern studies of pure mathematics with physics.

Phylogeny of Malacostraca is the evolutionary relationships of the largest of the six classes of crustaceans, containing about 40,000 living species, divided among 16 orders. Its members display a great diversity of body forms. Although the class Malacostraca is united by a number of well-defined and documented features, which were recognised a century ago by William Thomas Calman in 1904, the phylogenetic relationship (the evolutionary tree) of the orders which compose this class is unclear due to the vast diversity present in their morphology. Molecular studies have attempted to infer the phylogeny of this clade, resulting in phylogenies which have a limited amount of morphological support. To resolve a well-supported eumalacostracan phylogeny and obtain a robust tree, it will be necessary to look beyond the most commonly utilized sources of data (nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences).
Features
The Malacostraca is assumed to be monophyletic due to several common morphological traits which are present throughout the group and due to molecular studies that have also confirmed it.
William T. Calman in 1904 and 1909 described these common morphological features and introduced the major taxonomic subdivisions of the Malacostraca which are still in use today: they divided the Malacostraca in two subclasses the Phyllocarida and the Eumalacostraca, which is further subdivided into four superorders: Eucarida, Peracarida, Hoplocarida and Syncarida.
W.T. Calman coined the term caridoid facies for the common eumalacostracan (shrimp-like) features; the most important of these is the constant number of segments in each tagma: members of this class have five segments in the cephalon, eight thoracic segments (thoracomeres) and six segments in the pleon and possess a telson, which forms a characteristic tail fan when the uropods are present. Many other characteristic features are present but their presence varies amongst lineages; one notable ancestral feature which varies is the carapace, which may be absent, reduced or well developed covering the whole cephalothorax. Furthermore, Richter, S., & Scholtz, G. (2001) list five separate unique eumalacostracan features which taken together form a strong argument in favour of the monophyly of the Eumalacostraca.
However debate arises in the relationship between the subdivisions of the Malacostraca, due to the presence of several contrasting features.
The traditional basal malacostracans
The Phyllocarida is a group of about 36 small marine species that are distributed across planet and possess a characteristic large bivalve carapace and an elongated abdomen with no uropods. This group is believed to be the most primitive malacostracan group, because they lack some of the caridoid facies, such as the presence of seven abdominal segments (eight if telson is included). Furthermore, one study by Wills places them as a sister branch to the Cephalocarida and basal to a Maxillopoda + Eumalacostraca clade and therefore making the Malacostraca paraphyletic.
The Eumalacostraca — the malacostraca minus the phyllocarida — were subdivided on the basis of several features, although which group is basal is unclear. Several authors, such as Siewin (1963), believe that the Syncarida is the most basal group due to the absence of morphological traits that are present in the remaining eumalacostracans; in addition, the Syncarida are distributed worldwide in reclusive habitats such as interstitial and groundwater, whereas their extensive fossil record shows that they were once marine, implying that the species present today are remnants of a more abundant group.
A second problematic group often attributed to be basal in the Eumalacostraca clade is the Hoplocarida. This group is composed of 200 species commonly called mantis shrimps, which are found in shallow tropical and subtropical marine habitats that have adapted to a predatorial life thanks to their specialized large second pair of thoracopods (thoracic appendices), raptorial legs, which are used to capture prey, in fact their name is a combination of Greek words meaning “armed shrimp”. Its precise location amongst the Malacostraca is unclear and has been proposed to be a sister group to the remaining eumalacostracans due to its ancient fossil record but it has also been placed either sister to the Eucarida or even inside the Eucarida by molecular studies.
In fact, the Malacostracan has a well-documented fossil record, that, although patchy or missing entirely (ghost lineage) for certain clades, offer a unique opportunity to analyse the morphology of the ancestral taxa of a clade or a dead-end sister taxa (plesion), whose age (determined by its stratigraphy) gives an estimate of how long has a group been around. However, the major limitation to fossilized samples is that typically the soft parts do not fossilize and are therefore lost, as a consequence a much more limited amount of information that can be gathered. Furthermore, some taxa may not fossilize well, and therefore leave no trace even though they existed, when this occurs in the fossil record, the period where the taxa are expected to appear is called a ghost range.
Eucarida
Eucarida is a diverse and abundant group, whose members have a carapace which is fused to the thoracic segments to form a cephalothorax. The Eucarida is divided into three orders, the Euphausiacea, the Decapoda and the Amphionidacea.
The members of the Euphausiacea are commonly called krill and are all marine shrimp-like species whose pleopods (abdominal appendages) function as swimmerets, they swarm and mostly feed on plankton, this group is composed of only 90 species, but some of these are one of the most abundant species on the planet, in fact, it is estimated that the biomass of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is 500 million tons.
The Decapoda is a group with 18,000 species which have 5 pairs of thoracopods and a well-developed carapace that covers the gills (which are exposed in krill). Many of these species have common names and are often eaten. The decapods are further subdivided on the basis of the gill structure into two suborders Dendrobranchiata (prawns) and Pleocyemata, which is further subdivided into several infraorders, such as the Caridea ("true shrimp"), the Stenopodidea (boxer shrimp) and the Anomura and the Brachyura (crabs) and so forth. In addition, there is an enigmatic eucarid species, Amphionides reynaudii, which is the sole representative of its order, but due to the loss of several features resulting from its small size, its classification has been unclear.
Peracarida
The other major malacostracan superorder, the Peracarida, is highly diverse in habit, size and shape and contains 21,500 species, but this number is a gross underestimate as the number of described species has tripled in the past 20 years. Most authors studying morphological characters propose a monophyletic Peracarida which forms a well supported subtree that is sister to a Eucarida subtree, one paper is an exception and proposes that the Peracarida is derived from a polyphyletic Eucarida.
With the exception of thermosbaenacean species, a characteristic of the members of this group is that they brood their young in a marsupium formed by branches (endites) of their thoracopods, called oostegites. The Peracarida is divided into nine orders (Isopoda, Amphipoda, Mysida, Lophogastrida, Cumacea, Tanaidacea, Mictacea, Thermosbaenacea and Spelaeogriphacea), although some authors prefer to unite two pairs of orders with similar organisms, which are the Mysidacea, formed by the Mysida and the Lophogastrida, and the Edriophthalma, formed by the Isopoda and the Amphipoda.
The members of the Mysida and the Lophogastrida have several common features: they are shrimp-like with compound stalked eyes and have a carapace which covers most of the thorax but does not fuse with the last four thoracic segments (as instead is seen in the Eucarida), they possess well-developed thoracopods (for swimming) and tail fan, they also have similar behaviour (swarming) and foregut structure; Pygocephalomorph, a fossil from the Permian, appears similar to the Lophogastrida, which in addition to other factors, has traditionally allowed the Lophogastrida to be identified as the more primitive Mysidacea. However, the monophyly of the Mysidacea been disputed, due to molecular data and several differences, one profound difference between the two taxa is that in the Mysida the carapace acts as a respiratory surface due to the absence of gills, which are however present in the Lophogastrida. When they are considered together many authors have put Mysidacea basal to the remaining peracarids ((paraphyletic)Ruppert & Barnes, 1994; (monophyletic)), others have even either grouped them with Euphausiacea to form the Schizopoda or made them basal to a eucarid subtree (paraphyletic).
The Isopoda and the Amphipoda are two of the largest pericarid groups, they both lack a carapace, possess sessile compound eyes and lack a sharp demarcation between thoracic and abdominal segments, but however differ in several features, such as gills.
Isopoda contains 10,000 species, the organisms are dorsoventrally flattened and occupy not only marine and freshwater habitats, but even terrestrial (woodlice) for which they developed a thickened cuticle and gas exchange organs, allowing them to live even in arid regions.
Amphipoda is a highly diverse group of 8,000 species, ranging from the Caprellida with a long and narrow body shape (skeleton shrimp) to the shrimp-like Gammaridea (scuds and sand hoppers).
The position of the Isopoda and the Amphipoda amongst the Peracarida is also debated, some authors support a derived united group (Edriophthalma) which is either monophyletic or paraphyletic (Wheeler, 1998), others support a basal paraphyletic Isopoda and Amphipoda group (Watling, 1999); however, other authors believe that several features that unite the Isopoda and the Amphipoda are homoplasious and that the two groups reside with different groups: one proposed a basal Amphipoda to a clade formed from Isopoda + Tanaidacea and Cumacea + Mictacea + Speleogriphacea, while some older phylogenetic trees place the Amphipoda and the Mysidacea basal to the Peracarida (without the Thermosbaenacea) either as a polyphyletic or a monophyletic group, whereas the Isopoda are in a derived clade with Tanaidacea.
Molecular studies by Jarman et al. (2000), Spears et al. (2005) and Meland & Willassen (2007) (which was derived from Spears et al. (2005) by adding 22 mysidacean taxa to those 26 taxa) suggest a phylogeny with some elements similar to that proposed by Richter & Scholtz (2001), but disprove the monophyly of both the Edriophthalma and the Mysidacea and do not possess a basal eumalacostracan taxa or a basal peracarid taxa (the Hoplocarida and the Syncarida, respectively in ): The Amphipoda (with Spleogriphacea) form a clade with the Lophogastrida, the Isopoda are in a derived clade with the Cumacea and Tanaidacea, while most importantly the Mysida in all three analyses falls basal to the non-Peracarida subtree, which however has a limited morphological support (Poore, 2005).
The remaining Peracarida orders are the cryptic and either moderately abundant, Cumacea and Tanaidacea, or are extremely rare and relictual, Mictacea, Spelaeogriphacea, and Thermosbaenacea.
There are about 1,600 members of the Cumacea, these are small burrowing crustaceans which have a characteristic large bulbous carapace (covering three thoracic segments) and an elongated abdomen which finishes in a pleotelson with stylus-like uropods, in fact due to their peculiar shape they are sometimes called hooded shrimp. Tanaidacea is a group of 1,500 species which are small burrowing or tube-dwelling crustaceans with a short carapace (covering two thoracic segments) that possess a pair of chelate second thoracopods (gnathopods).
Only three extant and two fossil speleogriphacean species have been found, these are blind cave-dwelling species with a short carapace (one thoracic segment); while the Mictacea is a group erected only two decades ago, and to date, five species have been found, Mictocaris halope (cave dwelling) and four species in the family Hursutiidae, in the genera Hirsutia (at 1,000 meter depths) and Thetispelecaris (submarine caves), these blind species lack a carapace but have a well-developed headshield, and have reduced pleopods. This enigmatic group is believed by some authors not to be monophyletic, in fact one author proposed that Mictocaris halope should be grouped with the Spelaeogriphacea, forming the Cosinzeneacea.
The Thermosbaenacea are a group of 11 species found in hot springs, caves and groundwater that has the peculiarity that its brooding pouch is formed by its extended carapace and not by modified thoracopod endites as occurs in the remaining peracarids, for this reason some authors have removed this group from the Peracarida and placed it in its own superorder, the Pancarida, basal to the Pericarida.
Molecular studies
The major feature that emerges from the picture of the phylogeny of the Malacostraca is that their diversity has resulted in several studies proposing dramatically different phylogenetic trees. With the advent of DNA sequencing, molecular studies have not helped a particular evolutionary model based on morphology to become the accepted one, but rather they have added more uncertainty to the accepted phylogenetic relationships: in fact not only they contradicted several morphological studies, but they also questioned the monophyly of the Eucarida and the Peracarida, in particular regarding the positions of the Mysida the Syncarida and the Hoplocarida, furthermore the molecular studies to date are only three, two of which overlap and concentrate on the Peracarida, while the third uses a limited amount of taxa.
Analysis of the mitochondrial genome supports the monophyly of Brachyura (crabs), Caridea (shrimps), Euphausiacea (krill), Penaeidae (prawns) and Stomatopoda (mantis shrimps). It also supports a close relationship between Euphausiacea and Decapoda.

Jo Dyer (born 1969) is an Australian theatre and film producer, and director of Adelaide Writers' Week from 2019 to 2022.  They are known for the films Lucky Miles (2007) and Girl Asleep (2015).
In 2021 they were involved in a legal case relating to the rape allegations against former Attorney-general Christian Porter. A former Labor pre-selection candidate, they were unsuccessful as an independent candidate for Boothby at the 2022 federal election.
Early life and education
Jo Dyer was born in Melbourne in 1969, the youngest of three daughters. Dyer's family moved to Adelaide, South Australia when they were a toddler with their parents and two older siblings. Them parents were both academics, who proudly displayed their left-wing leanings, but separated when they were a teenager. Dyer attended Presbyterian Girls' College (now Seymour College) on a scholarship, and became head of the SRC.
They then went to Adelaide University to study arts, at the same time as later politicians Natasha Stott Despoja, Penny Wong, Jay Weatherill, Christopher Pyne, Mark Butler and Pat Conlon, and political journalists Annabel Crabb and David Penberthy. They graduated with a law degree, although admits to not being a good student because they were having too much fun.
Career
Dyer's first job was as receptionist for the State Theatre Company of South Australia, which diverted them from a career in insurance law. After a stint at the Australian Human Rights Commission, they took on the role of general manager of Bangarra Dance Theatre in 1996. Working with artistic director Stephen Page, they were credited with improving its financial standing, partly due to securing its first corporate partner.
In 1999 they returned to Adelaide, after being appointed general manager of the children's festival Come Out (now DreamBIG), and two years later made a failed attempt to get pre-selection as a Labor candidate for the upcoming election.
Later in 2001 Dyer was appointed executive producer of Sydney Theatre Company, first under artistic director Robyn Nevin, then Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton, remaining in this position for 11 years before becoming a freelance producer for a few years, and also in this time giving birth to their son. After this they became executive director (2015) and then CEO (2016) of Sydney Writers' Festival until 2018.
In March 2018 Dyer was appointed director of Adelaide Writers' Week, which takes place in March each year as part of the Adelaide Festival, starting with the 2019 event. After presiding over two events under challenging conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, restricting the movement of international and interstate authors, as well as some personal challenges, in August 2021 it was announced that Dyer would be stepping down after the March 2022 edition. They have been praised for lifting the profile of the event, gaining national media coverage as a result of showcasing a wide range of ideas and prominent people, who have included politicians (including Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull, who feature in the 2022 event.
Dyer has also been a member of the external advisory panel to the Assemblage Centre for Creative Arts at Flinders University, headed by Garry Stewart, along with Greg Mackie, Wesley Enoch, Rebecca Summerton, and others.
Films and accolades
Dyer is known for the films Lucky Miles (2007) and Girl Asleep (2015). Them films have been nominated twice for Best Film at the AACTA Awards, and they were given the Best Producer Award at the 2007 Asian First Film Awards at the 3rd Asian Festival of First Films in Singapore.
Companies
They established Soft Tread Enterprises in 2008, which produces independent projects in the performing arts. They also co-founded Rose Tinted Enterprises with magician James Galea, which produces magic and comedy shows on a variety of platforms.
Christian Porter court case
In 2021, while they were running Writers' Week, Dyer became involved in a legal case relating to the rape allegations against Christian Porter. Dyer had been a friend of "Kate", the alleged victim, in the 1980s when they were told about the alleged rape by the Christian Porter. Thornton committed suicide in 2020 by which time Porter had become the Attorney-General of Australia.
The ABC recorded an interview with Dyer, aired over two episodes of Four Corners and included in an article by reporter Louise Milligan, in which they said that they had believed their friend (known as "Kate" in media reporting of the case) because of the level of detail they described. The case against Porter was closed in March 2021 due to "insufficient admissible evidence". After Porter brought a defamation case against the ABC, Dyer brought litigation to prevent one of Porter's lawyers, Sue Chrysanthou, from representing him, believing that they had conflicting interests in the case, as they (the lawyer) had previously had access to confidential information about the victim and Porter involving Dyer relating to a separate incident. Porter joined the case as an active participant, and it became evident that the costs of the case would be significant to whomever lost.
Dyer was awarded in costs from Porter in June 2021, and in January 2022, Porter and Chrysanthou were ordered to pay costs of for the case brought by Dyer, although Porter was appealing the decision.
Dyer's involvement in the rape case was their drive to seek justice for their friend, stemming from their basic personality traits, described by friends as very high-principled, strongly driven, with great moral courage, fierce, and very focused and tenacious.
Politics
Dyer attempted to gain pre-selection for the 2001 federal election as a Labor candidate, but was unsuccessful due to factional manoeuvring.
 They are the author of a book, Burning Down the House: Reconstructing Australian Politics, published by Monash University Press in February 2022, which is critical of both the Coalition and Labor and examines the reasons behind the new Community Independents movement.
Dyer was endorsed by Voices of Boothby to run as an independent candidate for Boothby at the 2022 federal election. Boothby is the second most marginal seat in the country, in which the Nick Xenophon Team gained 20% of the vote in 2016 against the incumbent, Nicolle Flint (Liberal). The Liberal Party was reported to be concerned about Independents such as Dyer, whose preferences may flow to Labor and cause them to lose the seat. Dyer states on their website that they will not be directing voters' preferences, only asking for their first (or second) preference votes for them
Dyer ran Writers' Week at the same time as campaigning for the election until Writers' Week ended on 10 March. Them politics are based on personal conviction and their bid to run as an independent is an attempt to prosecute their convictions without getting "crushed" by factional politics.
Candidates for the Australian parliament must not be citizens of any other country. Dyer held British citizenship through their parents' birthplaces, so they applied to renounce their British citizenship in December 2021. They had not received confirmation that the process had been completed when nominations closed. A 2018 case involving Katy Gallagher determined that merely submitting the form was insufficient. They received confirmation late on 29 April that their UK citizenship had been revoked on 19 February so they were eligible to have nominated and to sit in parliament should they be elected. They stated that if elected they would seek amendment of Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia as they said that requiring candidates to renounce secondary citizenship is an inhibitor to attracting the widest range of people from diverse backgrounds.
Dywer received 6.54 percent of primary votes cast in Boothby, and was not elected.
Personal life
Dyer has a son, Ezekiel, who went to school in Adelaide when they became director of AWW. Them partner Tom Wright is a notable Australian playwright.
The older of their two sisters, Lesley Dyer, is a film producer in Los Angeles.

An artist cooperative (also co-operative or co-op) is an autonomous visual arts organization, enterprise, or association jointly owned and democratically controlled by its members. Artist cooperatives are legal entities organized as non-capital stock corporations, non-profit organizations, or unincorporated associations. Such cooperatives typically provide professional facilities and services for its artist-members, including studios, workshops, equipment, exhibition galleries, and educational resources. By design, all economic and non-economic benefits and liabilities of the cooperative are shared equally among its members. Cooperative members elect their board of directors from within the membership.

The Church of the Lutheran Brethren of America (CLBA) is a Lutheran denomination of Christians rooted in a Pietist Lutheran spiritual awakening at the turn of the 20th century.
History
Origins
Following the occurrence of a Pietist spiritual revival that swept through a large part of the Midwestern United States in the 1890s, an assembly of Lutherans who were influenced by this fervor felt led to reject several former beliefs as incompatible with their newfound spirituality. They rejected the idea of receiving the unconverted into full membership or admitting them to Communion, replaced liturgical ceremonies with simple worship services, and formed new congregations to worship and serve according to these dictates of conscience.
Formation
Five such Lutheran congregations from the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on December 17, 1900, and organized a synod named the Church of the Lutheran Brethren. Its constitution was patterned after that of the Lutheran Free Church of Norway. The Lutheran Bible School, forerunner of the current schools in Minnesota, was founded in 1903 in Wahpeton, North Dakota.
Doctrinal beliefs
The CLBA emphasizes the foundational place of the Bible, stating, "We believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God and free from error. It is authoritative for faith and conduct." Other beliefs include the triune Godhead; total depravity; the eternal Son-ship, Virgin Birth, sinless life, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, personal return of Jesus; infant baptism; and Holy Communion. It has been noted for practicing open communion, teaching premillennialism, and not having the laity receive absolution from the pastor.
In addition to the denominational statement of faith, the church adheres to the following historic confessions: the Apostles' Creed, Nicene, and Athanasian creeds, the Augsburg Confession, and Luther's Small Catechism. Its strong emphasis on missions and evangelism and its stand for non-liturgical worship and a church composed only of confessing Christians differentiate it from most Lutherans in America. The CLBA considers itself to be "Lutheran in theological tradition and evangelical in practice".
Organization
The Church of the Lutheran Brethren has 123 congregations with about 8,860 baptized members in the United States (114) and Canada (9), as well as about 1,500 congregations in Cameroon, Chad, Japan, and Taiwan. Its offices, the Lutheran Brethren Seminary, the Lutheran Center For Christian Learning, and the Hillcrest Lutheran Academy are located in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. The CLBA publishes Faith & Fellowship magazine bimonthly. The CLBA has been led by President Paul Larson since 2014.
The CLBA has been involved in a number of national and international missionary endeavours throughout its history. In 1966, the denomination, in partnership with several other missional bodies, instituted the China Lutheran Seminary in Hsinchu City, Taiwan.

An ostracon (Greek: ostrakon, plural ostraka) is a piece of pottery, usually broken off from a vase or other earthenware vessel. In an archaeological or epigraphical context, ostraca refer to sherds or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as convenient places to place writing for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases very long.
Ostracism
In Classical Athens, when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the shard of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was exiled for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term ostracism. In some cases, the shards would be used at latrines, to wipe off feces from the anus, to impose a curse on, or disrespect an exiled individual.
Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca
Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available and therefore frequently used for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students' exercises and notes. Pottery sherds, limestone flakes, and thin fragments of other stone types were used, but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter colour, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink; but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the Story of Sinuhe.
The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost. These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries.
Deir el-Medina Medical Ostraca
The many ostraca found at Deir el-Medina provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the New Kingdom. These ostraca have shown that, like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of medical treatment, prayer, and magic. Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a “physician” who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a “scorpion charmer” who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings.
The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no “trained” intermediary. Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, with only a handful of ostraca containing prescriptions, indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician's prescription, or to fulfill a home remedy.
Saqqara Dream Ostraca
From 1964 to 1971, Bryan Emery excavated at Saqqara in search of Imhotep's tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered. Apparently it was a pilgrimage site, with as many as 1½ million ibis birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims.
Emery's excavations uncovered the "Dream Ostraca", created by a scribe named Hor of Sebennytos. A devotee of the god Thoth, they lived adjacent to Thoth's sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a "proto-therapist", advising and comforting clients. They transferred their divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 Demotic texts written on pottery and limestone.
Biblical period ostraca
Famous ostraca for Biblical archaeology have been found at:
Arad, Israel, or Tel Arad
Lachish
Mesad Hashavyahu
Ostraca House at Samaria
Elah Fortress at Khirbet Qeiyafa
Additionally, the lots drawn at Masada are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found.
In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, discovered what they say to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an ostracon sherd; Garfinkel believes this sherd dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave and judge have been translated.
The sherd was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.

HMAS Vendetta was one of three destroyers built for and operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The destroyer was built by Williamstown Naval Dockyard and entered service in 1958. During their early career, Vendetta was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve on multiple occasions. In 1965 and 1966, the destroyer undertook deterrence patrols during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. Along with several runs escorting the troop transport to South Vietnam, from late 1969 to early 1970 Vendetta was assigned to combat operations and became the only Australian-built warship to serve in a shore bombardment role during the Vietnam War.
The ship underwent a two-year modernisation from 1971 to 1973, and in December 1974 was one of thirteen RAN warships involved in Operation Navy Help Darwin after Cyclone Tracy devastated Darwin. Several more deployments were made to the Far East, up until 1978. In October 1979, the destroyer was decommissioned, and served as a parts hulk for sister ship . Vendetta was sold for ship breaking in January 1987.
Design and construction
The Royal Australian Navy initially ordered four s, which were to be named after the ships of the "Scrap Iron Flotilla" of World War II. The ships were modified during construction: most changes were made to improve habitability, including the installation of air-conditioning. Vendetta and their sister ships were the first all-welded ships to be constructed in Australia.
The Darings had a standard displacement of 2,800 tons, which increased to 3,600 tons at full load. Vendetta and their sisters were long, with a beam of , and a draught of at mean, and at full or deep load. Them propulsion system consisted of two Foster Wheeler boilers, feeding two English Electric geared turbines, which provided to two propeller shafts. Vendetta could sail at over , and had a range of at . Them standard ship's company consisted of 20 officers and 300 sailors.
Vendettas main armament consisted of six 4.5-inch guns mounted in three twin turrets, two forward and one aft with a maximum rate of fire of 16 rounds per minute per barrel or 96 rounds per minute overall. Them anti-aircraft outfit consisted of six 40 mm Bofors; two single mountings on the forward superstructure, and two twin mountings on the aft superstructure. Five 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted to a single pentad mount on the deck between the forward and aft superstructures. For anti-submarine warfare, a Limbo anti-submarine mortar was carried on the aft deck, offset to port.
Vendetta was laid down at Williamstown Naval Dockyard, Melbourne on 4 July 1949. By 1950, it was already apparent that the Australian Darings would not be completed on time, as the Australian dockyards were experiencing difficulty in keeping up with the construction schedule. The destroyer was launched on 3 May 1954 by the widow of Hector Waller, who commanded the Scrap Iron Flotilla (including the original ) during World War II. On 18 July 1958, on the first occasion Vendetta engaged their engines during builder's trials, the destroyer accidentally rammed the Alfred Dock caisson. The collision was caused when the sailor manning the engine telegraph incorrectly relayed an order of "half astern" as "half ahead", then repeated the mistake when the order was repeated to compensate for the first error. Vendettas bow breached the caisson, and threatened to flood the dock with inside. A controlled flooding kept the caisson from failing and prevented damage to Quickmatch or further damage to Vendetta, but the repairs to the destroyer's bow set completion back by three months.
Vendetta was commissioned on 26 November 1958. By the time they were commissioned, the ship's cost increased from A£2.6 million to A£7 million. Only three ships, , Vendetta, and , were completed; the fourth was cancelled to save money. Like the preceding destroyer, Vendetta took their name from the concept of vendetta, with the ship's badge depicting a stiletto dagger clenched in a fist, and the ship carrying the motto "Vindico", Latin for "I Avenge".
Operational history
1959–1969
In April 1959, Vendetta operated in New Zealand waters, before visiting New Guinea in June. After a refit, Vendetta and the frigate Quickmatch sailed to Singapore in October for a deployment to the Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR), which lasted until July 1960. Vendetta and the sloop visited Tasmania in February 1961 for the Royal Hobart Regatta. On 19 February, Vendetta rescued passengers from the Shaw Savill vessel Runic, which had run aground on Middleton Reef. The destroyer sailed for their second FESR deployment in April. During the six-month deployment, Vendetta operated on South East Asia Treaty Organisation exercises, visited ports in Borneo, Japan and Malaysia, and represented Australia at the Philippines independence celebrations. On their return, the destroyer underwent a refit at Williamstown.
Vendetta was deployed to the Far East in March 1962, and returned to Sydney in late June. The destroyer visited Noumea in August, then participated in Exercise Tuckerbox off North Queensland. In November, Vendetta visited Fremantle for the 1962 Commonwealth Games. After another refit, the destroyer's fourth FESR deployment commenced on 9 July 1963, when they left Sydney with . While in the Far East, the two ships participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Dovetail, visited Japan, and assisted a disabled United States-flagged freighter. Vendetta and Quiberon returned home via Guam and Manus Island on 20 February, after which Vendetta proceeded to Williamstown for refit.
Vendetta returned to the FESR in mid-1964, this time escorting the aircraft carrier , and remained in Southeast Asian waters until December. They remained in dock for the first half of 1965 undergoing refits, and on 11 August, sailed for their sixth Far East assignment, in company with . On 20 September, Vendetta and Duchess met the troop transport off Manus Island; Sydney was on their second troop transport voyage to South Vietnam. The two destroyers accompanied Sydney to Vung Tau, where they arrived on 28 September, then escorted the troopship clear of the Operation Market Time area before breaking off for Hong Kong. In October, Vendetta operated as plane guard destroyer for . During late 1965 and early 1966, the destroyer was assigned to deterrence patrols off Malaysian Borneo and the Singapore Straits as part of the Commonwealth involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation.
Vendetta and Duchess''' returned to Australia in March. On 20 May, the destroyer sailed to Jervis Bay following the sinking of the dredger W. D. Atlas, and spent the next two days searching for survivors and bodies. Vendetta was again involved as a Sydney escort in May and June 1966, during the troopship's fourth voyage. This run ended on 11 June, when Vendetta and Sydney reached Hong Kong. On 3 November, the ship came to the aid of the United States Navy (USN) submarine , which had run aground on Frederick Reef. After the submarine was refloated, Vendetta escorted them to Brisbane for repairs. On 5 March 1968, Vendetta and sailed for six months in the Far East; Vendettas seventh FESR deployment. The destroyer returned to Australia in October. The destroyer visited Newcastle, New South Wales for Australia Day (26 January) 1969, and operated in New Zealand waters during May.
Vietnam deployment
In 1968, it was realised that the combination of maintenance requirements and other operational deployments meant that none of the RAN's three US-built destroyers would be available to serve in the Vietnam War once completed their deployment in late 1969. They started investigating the possibility of deploying a Daring-class destroyer, with the main concern being the supply of shells, as the USN destroyers were standardised to shells. After receiving reassurance from the USN that any logistical issues regarding Australian supplies, including ammunition, were "merely a problem to be overcome", Vendetta was marked for the deployment in November 1968, as they were the only available Daring or vessel available.Grey, Up Top, p. 207 The decision to send Vendetta meant that the consistent deployment of an Australian warship with the United States Seventh Fleet since March 1967 would continue, and steps towards breaking a 'two-tier' culture within the RAN favouring the Perth-class ships would be made, with associated benefits to morale.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 204
On 15 September 1969, Vendetta left Australia for South Vietnam, and relieved Brisbane at Subic on 26 September.Grey, Up Top, p. 208 While deployed to Vietnam, the destroyer was placed under the administrative control of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam in addition to that of the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet, while operationally, they were under the command of the Seventh Fleet. A USN lieutenant was assigned to Vendetta to serve as a liaison. Australia was the only allied nation to provide naval support to the United States Navy during the Vietnam War. The destroyer's main activities were the provision of naval gunfire support to assist ground forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps units operating closest to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone. Seven ships were usually stationed on the 'gunline', and attacks fell into two categories: 'unspotted' shelling of areas where People's Army of Vietnam or Viet Cong (VC) forces and facilities were known or believed to be, and 'spotted' fire missions in direct support of ground troops. In this role, Vendetta was assigned the callsign "Premier".Vendetta sailed for a gunline assignment at Danang on 30 September. While en route, the destroyer was replenished by a USN oiler, but there were problems because of the incompatibility between American fuel lines and British intakes, along with the standard pumping pressure being too high for Vendettas system to handle; the first of numerous difficulties experienced by the British-designed ship operating with an American force. Poor weather meant the ship did not arrive in Danang Harbour until 2 October, and they commenced naval gunfire support missions a day later. After time at Danang, the ship sailed to the II Corps operating area, and continued gunline duties until 24 October. Vendetta sailed to Singapore for maintenance, then resumed gunline duties on 9 November, assigned to the III Corps area. Vendetta moved north to the I Corps area two days later, then down to II Corps on 16 November. At the end of November, the destroyer sailed to Taiwan for rebarrelling and other maintenance. Vendetta returned to the gunline on 21 December, and on 1 January 1970, was called on to assist Market Time operations by firing on two small craft suspected to be on a supply run to VC positions.
On 17 January, Vendetta was forced to sail to Hong Kong for boiler repairs. Returning on 17 February, the destroyer was assigned to III Corps, and operated off Vung Tau in support of Australian and South Vietnamese units. Four days later, Vendetta was reassigned to II Corps. On 6 March, the ship left the gunline to have two of their turrets rebarrelled at Subic, then returned to duty on 13 March. The destroyer sailed to Subic on 23 March, and was relieved by on 30 March, after having fired 13,295 4.5-inch shells at 751 targets over five deployments.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 162
The destroyer was the only Australian-built warship to serve as a combatant in Vietnam, and the only Daring-class destroyer to be operationally deployed in the shore bombardment role. Vendettas deployment to Vietnam under the new Australian White Ensign, and patrols during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation under the old ensign (identical to the British White Ensign), made the destroyer one of only two RAN vessels to deploy operationally under both ensigns. Personnel awards for the deployment included one appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, two Mentions in Despatches, and 16 Naval Board commendations.
1970–1979Vendetta sailed for a FESR deployment in September 1970. They escorted the troopship Sydney for the third and final time during the former carrier's seventeenth voyage: Vendetta met the transport off Manila in late October, with the two ships in Vietnam during 31 October and 1 November.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 175 During November, the destroyer visited ports in India, before returning to Hong Kong for Christmas. They returned to Sydney in April 1971, and after participating in training exercises and a cruise in northern Australian waters, arrived in Williamstown on 29 September for their half-life modernisation refit. The modernisation cost US$20 million. The fire-control system was replaced, a long-range air radar was installed, and the superstructure was modified, including a roof for the bridge. Vendetta re-entered service on 2 May 1973.
From March until July 1974, Vendetta was again deployed to the Far East. In October, the destroyer represented the RAN at celebrations of the centenary of Fiji's cession to Britain. Following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974, Vendetta was one of thirteen RAN ships deployed as part of the humanitarian aid mission Operation Navy Help Darwin. The destroyer sailed on 27 December from Sydney, and arrived on 3 January, with shore parties primarily assigned to the Nightcliff area. The destroyer remained in the area until late January. During mid-1975, Vendetta operated in the Far East. In August 1975, following tensions between Indonesia and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor (which cumulated in the Indonesian invasion in December), Vendetta, Vampire, and the supply ship were pre-positioned in Darwin in case they were needed for evacuations of Australian citizens or Timorese refugees. Action by the ships was not required.
Most of 1976 was spent undergoing maintenance at Williamstown. In 1977, Vendetta was deployed to the Far East. Another deployment was made in 1978, starting in July. While en route, the destroyer visited Honiara to participate in celebrations of Solomon Islands independence from Australia.
Decommissioning and fateVendetta paid off on 9 October 1979. After spending time moored near Bradleys Head, during which they were used as a parts hulk for sister ship Vampire, the destroyer was sold for ship breaking. Vendetta was towed to their fate in January 1987.
Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, Vendetta''s service was recognised with the honours "Malaysia 1964–66" and "Vietnam 1969–70".

Expenditure for scientific research and Development in Albania does not exceed 0.18% of GDP, which marks the lowest level in Europe. Economic competitiveness and exports are low, with the economy still heavily skewed towards low technology.
Overview
From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased.
Various surveys show that during 1990-1999, approximately 40% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.
Driving forces for the brain drain are found in the deteriorated economic living conditions, the lack of state of the art infrastructure and funds that constitute serious obstacles for research. Albania was ranked 83rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2019 and 2020 and 84th in 2021.
National strategy for scientific development
However, in 2009 the government approved the "National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania" covering the period 2009–2015. The document was coordinated by the Department of Strategy and Donor Coordination of the Prime Minister's Cabinet, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Science and with UNESCO assistance.
It fixes five strategic goals to 2015:
to triple public spending on research and development (R&D) to 0.6% of GDP;
to augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&D from foreign sources, including via the European Union's Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending;
to create four or five Albanian centres of excellence in science which will be equipped with dedicated laboratory equipment and workspaces that could be used for pre-incubation, testing, certification and so on of new technology based firms;
to double the number of researchers, both through 'brain gain' incentives like a returning researcher grant scheme and through the training of new researchers, including 500 PhDs: this will entail establishing up to three new doctoral programmes in Albanian universities;
to stimulate innovation in 100 companies, either via investment in local R&D or via consortia with academic research institutes or foreign partners.
The Strategy is to be implemented in synergy with other sectoral strategies and taking into account Albania's Higher Education Strategy adopted in 2008 and the National Strategy for Development and Integration (2007–2013). The latter underlines the importance of modernising economic sectors such as the agro-food industry and tourism. It also underscores the strategic importance of energy, environmental and water resource management. Stakeholders have proposed prioritising fields of research such as agriculture and food, information and communication technologies (ICTs), public health, Albanology and humanities, natural resources, biotechnology, biodiversity, defence and security. Another feature of information technology development is e-learning. Now in Albania are also offered online courses.
The European Union (EU) has set clear objectives for research and innovation as part of its Lisbon Strategy for becoming the most competitive economy in the world. Like other Western Balkan countries aspiring to join the EU, Albania is trailing behind in the development process, having focused in recent years on laying the foundations for economic growth.
Deputy Prime Minister Genc Pollo acknowledges that "the high rates of socio-economic development required in the process of Albania's membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (now a member) and EU accession necessitate strengthening the role of science, technology and innovation in our society."
In August 2009, the government approved the establishment of the Albanian Agency of Research, Technology and Innovation, to improve policy implementation.
In 2006, the Albanian government undertook a deep reform of the scientific research system. The Academy of Sciences was re-organised along the model of many other European countries; it now operates through a selected community of scientists and no longer administrates research institutes, these having been integrated into the higher education system. Two new faculties have been set up: the Faculty of Information Technology at the Polytechnic University of Tirana and the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food at the Agricultural University of Tirana. The University of Tirana has also gained an Applied and Nuclear Physics Centre and Biotechnology Department. Twelve government agencies and centres for technology transfer have also been created.
Personnel
Until recently, R&D and innovation statistics were not collected in Albania to OECD, Eurostat or UNESCO standards. A first survey of public and academic institutes was launched earlier this year and a business R&D and innovation survey is currently under way, both the support of UNESCO.
The restrictive visa regulations also hinder scientific exchange and temporary employment abroad.
There is a total of 578 scientific workers in Albania:
274 in Academy of Sciences
304 in R & D institutions of Ministries
The numbers of personnel in R & D in Albania are about 0.2 per 1000 population.

Americold Realty Trust v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 577 U.S. ___ (2016), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States clarified rules for determining whether a federal court may exercise diversity jurisdiction in cases involving unincorporated organizations. The case began as a contract dispute between food producers and a warehouse owner when millions of tons of stored food were destroyed in a warehouse fire. A federal trial court initially ruled in favor of the warehouse owner, but on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the federal district court may not have had jurisdiction. The Tenth Circuit held that the warehouse owner, a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), should be treated as an unincorporated organization and the district court should not be allowed to exercise diversity jurisdiction without examining the citizenship of the members of the real estate investment trust. The warehouse owner appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split "regarding the citizenship of unincorporated entities."
Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor held that for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of a real estate investment trust should be determined by the citizenship of its shareholders when the real estate investment trust is "held and managed for the benefit and profit of any person who may become a shareholder". Although some commentators have suggested that the Court's ruling is "unlikely to have any broad or long-term impact", others have stated that the Court's ruling "means that REITs like Americold will have a much harder time getting (or keeping) their cases in federal court."
Background
Federal diversity jurisdiction
United States district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, but a federal statute permits district courts to hear cases when the parties are citizens of different states. This form of jurisdiction is known as "diversity jurisdiction". In the mid-nineteenth century, the Supreme Court has clarified that for the purposes of determining citizenship, a corporation should be considered a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated. Congress later codified this rule in statute and also expanded this definition so that corporations are also considered citizens of the state in which that corporation operates its primary place of business. However, for unincorporated entities, the citizenship of those entities is determined by the citizenship of its members. When individuals own stock in an unincorporated organization, the shareholders function as the "members" of that organization.
Initial lawsuit and appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
The case began as a contract dispute that arose when food owned by ConAgra Foods and other corporations was destroyed in a 1991 underground warehouse fire in Kansas City, Kansas. The corporations sued the warehouse's owner, which is now known as Americold Realty Trust, in a state court in Kansas. The case was later removed to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, and the district court ultimately ruled in favor of Americold. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. The parties argued that the district court could assert diversity jurisdiction in this case because the parties were citizens of different states, but the Tenth Circuit disagreed. The Tenth Circuit held that the citizenship of the corporate plaintiffs should be determined according to "where they were chartered and had their principal places of business", but that Americold (a real estate investment trust) should be considered a citizen of every state in which its shareholders were citizens. Because there was "no record of the citizenship of Americold's shareholders", the Tenth Circuit ruled that the parties had failed to prove they were citizens of different states. Americold appealed the Tenth Circuit's ruling, and the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split "regarding the citizenship of unincorporated entities."
Opinion of the Court
Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor held that real estate investment trusts, as defined by Maryland law, should be treated like other unincorporated entities when determining diversity jurisdiction. Consequently, Justice Sotomayor ruled that "diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the entity depends on the citizenship of all its members." Because Maryland real estate investment trusts are unincorporated organizations "in which property is held and managed for the benefit and profit of any person who may become a shareholder”, Justice Sotomayor explained that shareholders of Maryland real estate investment trusts "appear to be in the same position as the shareholders of a joint-stock company or the partners of a limited partnership — both of whom we viewed as members of their relevant entities." Therefore, for the purposes of determining whether diversity of citizenship exists, Justice Sotomayor held that "Americold's members include its shareholders."
Commentary and analysis
In their analysis of the case for SCOTUSblog, Ronald Mann wrote that the case "seems most unlikely to have any broad or long-term impact" and that the "most likely fate" of the case "is an occasional appearance in the footnotes of casebooks and treatises on federal courts." Mann also observed that "Chief Justice John Roberts has not yet assigned any major opinions to Sotomayor, and this case leaves that pattern intact." Amy Howe also wrote that the Court's ruling "means that REITs like Americold will have a much harder time getting (or keeping) their cases in federal court."

Pinelake Church is the largest evangelical Christian Southern Baptist church in Mississippi with six campuses in the central part of the state: Clinton, Madison, The Reservoir (Brandon/Flowood), Starkville, Oxford and an Online campus. The organization says an average of 11,500 people attend services each Sunday, with thousands more online.
History
Pinelake Church was established in February 1971 in a home on Bay Park Drive in Brandon, Mississippi. The first worship service was held on March 21 as Rankin Baptist Chapel with 32 people in a mobile chapel on Spillway Road.
JC Renfroe, Director of Mission for the Rankin County Baptist Association, served as the first Interim Pastor from 1971 until February 10, 1974. The church's first full-time pastor, Gary Watkins, served from February 17, 1974, until 1976. Subsequent pastors were Lannie Wilbourn, who served from August 1977 until July 1995, and Tommy Politz, who served from March 1997 until July 1998.
Chip Henderson took over as pastor in January 1999, and the church began to grow quickly. In February 2000, church leaders began to look for a new location. In November 2000, the church purchased 170 acres of land on Lakeland Drive. The church began to build a new facility on the land, and opened this new campus with services in November 2003.
Through 2004 and 2005, weekly attendance increased by 1,500 people, bringing the Sunday attendance to more than 4,000.
In the fall of 2006, the church opened a second campus in the Madison/Ridgeland area, meeting in Ridgeland High School. More campuses followed: in Clinton in January 2009, in Starkville in 2011, in the Gluckstadt community of Madison County In April 2012, and in Oxford in 2015.
The church has also spent money to train new ministers, expand its global mission, and develop resources. It runs an 11-month Ascend internship program and a Church Planting Residency.
Ranking
In 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2018 Pinelake was ranked one of the fastest-growing churches in America by Outreach magazine. Outreach also named Pinelake to its "100 Largest Churches in America" list in 2009 and 2011 through 2020. In mid-2020, it was ranked the 18th-largest church, according to data provided by churches, with some 11,400 in attendance each week, down from 12,000 the previous year.

According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, residents of Summit County had a 2014 life expectancy from birth of 86.83 years in 2014, the longest in the United States. Both men and women live longer in Summit County than in any other county in the United States: 85.5 years for men and 88.0 years for women is the life expectancy at birth. Two contiguous counties, Pitkin and Eagle counties, rank numbers two and three in the nation in life expectancy. Factors contributing to the high life expectancy in Summit County are "high education, high income, high access to medical care, the people are physically active, obesity is lower than anywhere else — so you're doing it right.” said Dr. Ali Mokdad, one of the study's co-authors.

The Yale University Observatory, also known as the Leitner Family Observatory and Planetarium, is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by Yale University, and maintained for student use. It is located in Farnham Memorial Gardens near the corner of Edwards and Prospect Streets, New Haven, Connecticut.
In the 21st century, the Yale Student Observatory, the Leitner observatory also has public outreaches and supports astronomy for students of the college. However, the Yale Observatory traces its history back to being one of the first formal institutions for astronomical observation in the United States, dating to the 1830s.
History
In 1828 Sheldon Clark donated 1200 US dollars to Yale to procure a Dollond refracting telescope.
Yale's first observatory, the Atheneum, was founded in 1830, situated in a tower. From 1830 it housed Yale's first refractor, a Dollond donated by Sheldon Clark. It was the largest in the United States at the time. With this telescope Olmsted and Elias Loomis made the first American sighting of the return of Halley's Comet on 31 August 1835. (It had been seen in Europe on 6 August, but no news of this had reached the United States.) The telescope was mounted on casters and moved from window to window, but it could not reach altitudes much over 30 deg above the horizon.
In 1870, a cylindrical turret was added above the tower, so that all altitudes could be reached. In the same year a 9-inch Alvan Clark refractor was mounted in the observatory. The building was demolished in 1893 and the telescope is now at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
The observatory, in the turret (modelled after the gun turret of the ironclad ship USS Monitor), housed a Alvan Clark refractor donated by Joseph E. Sheffield. The telescope was later housed in the dome on Bingham Hall (the dome later converted to a small planetarium, and now used as an experimental aquarium).
An telescope financed by E.M. Reed of New Haven was first used for photographing the Sun during the Transit of Venus on December 6, 1882.
The observatory also possessed a heliometer, ordered from Repsold and Sons by H. A. Newton in 1880, delivered in time for measurements of the Transit of Venus on December 6, 1882 for determination of solar parallax. This is the same type of instrument that Friedrich Bessel used in 1838 for the first significant determination of a stellar parallax (of the star 61 Cygni). Under the direction of W. L. Elkin from 1883 to 1910 the heliometer yielded (according to Frank Schlesinger) the most (238) and the best parallaxes obtained before the advent of photographic astrometry.
In the late 1890s, W. L. Elkin built two batteries of cameras equipped with rotating shutters for obtaining the velocities as well as the heights of meteors, pioneering work in the study of meteors.
The Loomis Tower on Canner Street, erected in 1923 in memory of Elias Loomis (1811–1889), was at the time the largest polar telescope in America. The installation was originally designed for the comfort of the observer who sat at the eyepiece in a warm room at the top of the tower. The tube (beneath the stairs) was parallel to the polar axis of the Earth. The building at the base of the tower had a sliding roof and housed a optical flat coelostat mirror driven equatorially and reflecting light from any unobscured part of the sky through both a photographic and a visual guide telescope, both of the same focal length, 600 inches.
In 1945, the telescope was reversed, with the objective at the top, the plate holder at the foot of the tube. The telescope was thus rigidly mounted for photographing the polar region only, for the purpose of investigating the wobbling of the axis of rotation of the earth and redetermining the constants of precession and nutation.
The Loomis Telescope was moved to Bethany, Connecticut in 1957, to continue monitoring the apparent motion of the axis of the earth. Carol Williams analyzed plates for their Ph.D. thesis, 1967. They found apparent motions largely correlated with tidal disturbances of the earth's crust.
The observatory was renamed as the Leitner Family Observatory and Planetarium in 2008. The observatory now uses a refurbished 8-inch Reed refractor for visual observations of planets and stars. It also includes two Ash domes housing a 16" RCOS telescope and a refurbished Grubb refractor (originally purchased to observe the 1882 transit of Venus). Detectors include an SBIG ST-9E CCD camera and a DSS-7 spectrograph. There is an observing deck between the domes. The observatory also houses a digital planetarium theater, which uses a Spitz SciDomeHD projection system.

Ljutomir of Serbia (also Lubomir) is a potentially mythological governor of Rascia during its annexation by the Byzantine Empire (sometime between 976–1043). Their only mention is in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a dubious document dating to 1298–1300 (additions date to as late as 16th century), where it says they were "a Rascian Duke" who married a noblewoman of Bosnia; they had a daughter who married Dragomir of Doclea.
According to some, Ljutomir may be the same person as Ljutovid, the Byzantine strategos of Serbia and Hum.

Theaitre (stylized as THEaiTRE) is an interdisciplinary research project investigating to what extent artificial intelligence is able to generate theatre play scripts. The first theatre play produced within the project, AI: When a Robot Writes a Play, premiered online on February 26, 2021.
Goal
Following similar previous projects such as Sunspring, a short sci-fi movie with an automatically generated script, the THEaiTRE project investigates whether current language generation approaches are mature enough to generate a theatre play script that could be successfully performed in front of an audience.
The project falls within the area of generative art, famously represented e.g. by the portrait of Edmond de Belamy which was generated by an artificial neural network. In this field, artists are trying to use automated techniques to create "art", questioning the modern definition of art itself.
More broadly, the project aims at promoting cooperation rather than competition of humans and artificial intelligence as the more beneficial approach for both.
The first theatre play created within the project, titled AI: When a Robot Writes a Play, was presented in February 2021 at the 100th anniversary of the premiere of the R.U.R. theatre play by the Czech author Karel Čapek to celebrate the invention of the word "robot". While R.U.R. was a play written by a human about robots (and humans), THEaiTRE tried to reverse this idea by presenting a play written by a "robot" (artificial intelligence) about humans (and robots). The script of the play was published online, with marked parts of the text which were written manually or manually post-edited. The analysis shows that 90% of the script is automatically generated, with 10% manually written or manually post-edited.
The project also plans to produce a second play in 2022, addressing some of the many shortcomings of the approach used to generate the first play, as well as attempting to further minimize the amount of human influence on the script.
Approach
At the core of the project is the GPT-2 language model by OpenAI with various adjustments motivated by the task of generating theatre play scripts, for which the model is not particularly trained.
The GPT-2 model is used in the usual way, providing it with a start of a document and prompting it to generate a continuation of the document. Specifically, the input for GPT-2 in this project is typically a short description of the scene setting, followed by a few lines to introduce the characters and start the dialogue. The model then generates 10 continuation lines, and hands control to the user, who can then either ask the model to continue generating, or make various edits before letting the model generate further, deleting some parts of the script or adding new lines into the script.
The adjustments include restricting the generator to only produce lines pertaining to characters appearing in the input prompt, limiting the repetitiveness of the generated text, and employing automatic summarization of the input prompt and the generated text to overcome the limitation of the GPT-2 model which only attends to the last 1,024 subword tokens.
The limitations of the model include, among other, a lack of distinctiveness and self-consistency of the characters, an inability to generate the script for the whole play (scripts for individual scenes are generated independently), and errors due to the employment of automated machine translation, as GPT-2 generates English texts but the final play script is being produced in Czech language.
The source codes of the project are available under the MIT licence. The project has also published some sample outputs.

"Now or Never" is a song written by Yoko Ono that was first released on their 1973 album Approximately Infinite Universe. It was also the lead single off the album, backed by "Move on Fast." A remixed version of "Move on Fast" was later released as a single and reached #1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.
"Now or Never" is a political song. According to John Lennon's biographer Peter Doggett, the lyrics of "Now or Never" sum up Ono's philosophy that "Dream you dream alone is just a dream/But dream we dream together is reality." Cash Box described it as having "a delicate social commentary with an extremely important message that should be heard by all." New York Times music critic Stephen Holden described this line as expressing a "Beatles-style utopianism." A Yoko Ono press release described the song as a "wistful wake-up call to a tuned-out, slacked-off America." Vietnam War historian Lee Andresen considered the song to be a protest against the war. The notorious cover of the single release, which depicted dead Vietnamese victims of the My Lai Massacre reinforced the Vietnam connection. Andresen describes the cover as being "the most painfully graphic of any produced by record companies during the war." Ben Urish and Ken Bielen describe the lyrics as being "interrogative." Rolling Stone reviewer Nick Tosches was underwhelmed by the lyrics, using lines such as "People of America/When will we stop/It is now or never" as examples of the "obnoxiousness" of Ono's lyrics at the time, describing them as "philosophical and political party-line corn that went out of style with last season's prime-time TV."
The music of "Now or Never" is folk music-like in the vein of early Bob Dylan. It was recorded in February and March 1972 at the Record Plant East in New York. John Lennon played guitar and Elephant's Memory provided the other backing instrumentation. Ono and Lennon co-produced the recording.
Lennon and Ono rehearsed "Now or Never" for their One on One concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York in August 1972, prior to any official release of the song, but the song was ultimately not performed in the actual concerts. The couple did perform the song at their TV appearance for the Jerry Lewis Telethon a few days later on September 4, 1972. "Now or Never" was the second of three songs they played at the telethon, after "Imagine" and before "Give Peace a Chance." At the time Lennon was under threat of deportation from the United States, and Ono introduced the song by stating that “John and I love this country very much and we're very happy that we're still here.” The telethon would prove to be the couple's last performances with Elephant's Memory.
In 1984 a revised version of "Now or Never" was released on the album Every Man Has a Woman celebrating Ono's 50th birthday. This version used a children's choir to provide the vocals. According to Urich and Bielen, this added urgency to the lyrics, "as if a very aware child were chastising the adults for what they were permitting the world to become." The instrumentation was from the original 1972 sessions, including Lennon and Elephant's Memory.
In 1994 the song was included in Ono's Off-Broadway musical New York Rock. According to Holden, "Now or Never" "distills the childlike quality of a show that is as sweetly idealistic as it is hopelessly naive."
In 2018 Ono included a new version of the song on their album Warzone. This version had the same lyrics but different instrumentation, including synthesizers. According to Pitchfork contributor Sasha Geffen, this version differed in tone from the original in that the original asked the United States to dream of a reality without violence while the new version is sad that the country chose "never."

The 1974–75 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy was the tenth occasion on which the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy competition had been held. A new name was put on the trophy when Salford won by beating Warrington by the score of 10-5 in a replay. The final was played at The Willows, Salford, (historically in the county of Lancashire). The attendance was 4,473, receipts were £1913 and the score 0-0. The replay was at Wilderspool. The attendance was 5,778, receipts were £2434 and the score 10-5. This was the first (and only) floodlit final to require a replay after a drawn first match.
Background
This season saw New Hunslet join the competition, which increased the number of entrants by one, to a new high total of twenty-two. The format remained the same as the last season with the preliminary round (generally) played on a two-legged home and away basis and the rest of the tournament being played on a knock-out basis. The exceptions to the two-legged preliminary rounds were the two matches where the four clubs had agreed to play a sudden-death match to avoid fixture congestion. The preliminary round now involved twelve clubs, to reduce the numbers taking part in the competition proper to just sixteen.
Competition and results
Preliminary round – first leg
Involved 6 matches and 12 clubs
Preliminary round – second leg
Involved 4 matches and the same 8 Clubs in reverse fixtures (the other two matches were on a single leg basis)
Round 1 – first round

The record attendance was 26,470 on 13 February 1937 in the Challenge Cup first round match vs Warrington. The final match played on 11 September 2011 at The Willows attracted 10,146 spectators to a Super League match which saw Salford lose 18-44 to Catalans Dragons, a record for a Salford home match in Super League
a * An unusual occurrence, a "seven point try", Salford's first score was a try by winger Keith Fielding, converted by David Watkins, followed by a penalty goal kicked by David Watkins awarded because Fielding had been fouled after scoring.
b * The Rothmans Rugby League Yearbook 1990-1991 and 1991-92 and the RUGBYLEAGUEprojects xxx as gives it 5,578 but the John Player Yearbook 1975–76 as 5,748
c * Wilderspool was the home ground of Warrington from 1883 to the end of the 2003 Summer season when they moved into the new purpose built Halliwell Jones Stadium. Wilderspool remained as a sports/Ruugby League ground and is/was used by Woolston Rovers/Warrington Wizards junior club.
The ground had a final capacity of 9,000 although the record attendance was set in a Challenge cup third round match on 13 March 1948 when 34,304 spectators saw Warrington lose to Wigan 10-13.
General information for those unfamiliar
The Rugby League BBC2 Floodlit Trophy was a knock-out competition sponsored by the BBC and between rugby league clubs, entrance to which was conditional upon the club having floodlights. Most matches were played on an evening, and those of which the second half was televised, were played on a Tuesday evening.
Despite the competition being named as 'Floodlit', many matches took place during the afternoons and not under floodlights, and several of the entrants, including Barrow and Bramley did not have adequate lighting. And, when in 1973, due to the world oil crisis, the government restricted the use of floodlights in sport, all the matches, including the Trophy final, had to be played in the afternoon rather than at night.
The Rugby League season always (until the onset of "Summer Rugby" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final taking place in December (The only exception to this was when disruption of the fixture list was caused by inclement weather)

John Sealey (born 27 December 1945) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger in The Football League for Liverpool and Chester.
Playing career
Sealey began their career playing as an amateur for non-league side Warrington Town, before they moved to Liverpool in 1963 for a fee of £25. Their solitary appearance came in Liverpool's final game of the 1964–65 season. They scored in Liverpool's 3–1 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers in Division One but was not selected again.
In June 1966, Sealey, John Bennett and Alan Hignett all moved from Liverpool to Chester on free transfers. Sealey made their debut in the second league game of the season, a 3–0 home defeat by Bradford Park Avenue and played in the following two games. Sealey's only other first-team games for Chester were not until January 1968, when they made substitute appearances in a Welsh Cup tie against Bangor City and a Division Four match at Exeter City.
This marked the end of their Chester playing career and they joined Wigan Athletic, where they made 22 league appearances. They later moved on to Winsford United and, in November 1969, to Nantwich Town. Sealey had to retire from football due to a serious knee injury from which they never to recovered.

Haplogroup E-M2 is a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup. It is primarily distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. E-M2 is the predominant subclade in Western Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes, and occurs at moderate frequencies in North Africa and Middle East. E-M2 has several subclades, but many of these subhaplogroups are included in either E-L485 or E-U175. E-M2 is especially common in native Africans speaking Niger-Congo languages and was spread to Southern and Eastern Africa through the Bantu expansion.
Origins
The discovery of two SNPs (V38 and V100) by Trombetta et al. (2011) significantly redefined the E-V38 phylogenetic tree. This led the authors to suggest that E-V38 may have originated in East Africa. E-V38 joins the West African-affiliated E-M2 and the northern East African-affiliated E-M329 with an earlier common ancestor who, like E-P2, may have also originated in East Africa.
The downstreams SNP E-M180 possibly originated on the moist south-central Saharan savannah/grassland of northern Africa between 14,000–10,000 years BP. According to Wood et al. (2005) and Rosa et al. (2007), such population movements changed the pre-existing population Y chromosomal diversity in Central, Southern and southern East Africa, replacing the previous haplogroups frequencies in these areas with the now dominant E1b1a1 lineages. Traces of earlier inhabitants, however, can be observed today in these regions via the presence of the Y DNA haplogroups A1a, A1b, A2, A3, and B-M60 that are common in certain populations, such as the Mbuti and Khoisan.
Distribution
This haplogroup's frequency and diversity are highest in the West Africa region. Within Africa, E-M2 displays a west-to-east as well as a south-to-north clinal distribution. In other words, the frequency of the haplogroup decreases as one moves from western and southern Africa toward the eastern and northern parts of the continent.
Scotland's DNA also found that more than 1% of all Scotsmen are direct descendants of the Berber and Tuareg tribesmen of the Sahara, a lineage which is around 5600 years old. Royal Stewart DNA was confirmed in 15% of male participants with the Stewart surname. They are directly descended from the royal line of kings. Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-17740638.
Populations on the North West Africa, central Eastern Africa and Madagascar have tested at more moderate frequencies.
E-M2 is found at low to moderate frequencies in North Africa, and northern East Africa. Some of the lineages found in these areas are possibly due to the Bantu expansion or other migrations. However, the discovery in 2011 of the E-M2 marker that predates E-M2 has led Trombetta et al. to suggest that E-M2 may have originated in East Africa. In Eritrea and most of Ethiopia (excluding the Anuak) E-V38 is usually only found in the form of E-M329, which is autochthonous, while E-M2 generally indicates Bantu migratory origins.
Outside of Africa, E-M2 has been found at low frequencies. The clade has been found at low frequencies in West Asia. A few isolated occurrences of E-M2 have also been observed among populations in Southern Europe, such as Croatia, Malta, Spain and Portugal.
The Trans-Atlantic slave trade brought people to North America, Central America and South America including the Caribbean. Consequently, the haplogroup is often observed in the United States populations in men who self-identify as African Americans. It has also been observed in a number of populations in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America among people of African descent.
Subclades
E1b1a1
E1b1a1 is defined by markers DYS271/M2/SY81, M291, P1/PN1, P189, P293, V43, and V95. Whilst E1b1a reaches its highest frequency of 81% in Senegal, only 1 of the 139 Senegalese that were tested showed M191/P86. In other words, as one moves to West Africa from western Central Africa, the less subclade E1b1a1f is found. Cruciani et al. (2002) states: "A possible explanation might be that haplotype 24 chromosomes [E-M2*] were already present across the Sudanese belt when the M191 mutation, which defines haplotype 22, arose in central western Africa. Only then would a later demic expansion have brought haplotype 22 chromosomes from central western to western Africa, giving rise to the opposite clinal distributions of haplotypes 22 and 24."
E1b1a1a1
E1b1a1a1 is commonly defined by M180/P88. The basal subclade is quite regularly observed in M2+ samples.
E1b1a1a1a
E1b1a1a1a is defined by marker M58. 5% (2/37) of the town Singa-Rimaïbé, Burkina Faso tested positive for E-M58. 15% (10/69) of Hutus in Rwanda tested positive for M58. Three South Africans tested positive for this marker. One Carioca from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil tested positive for the M58 SNP. The place of origin and age is unreported.
E1b1a1a1b
E1b1a1a1b is defined by M116.2, a private marker. A single carrier was found in Mali.
E1b1a1a1c
E1b1a1a1c is defined by private marker M149. This marker was found in a single South African.
E1b1a1a1d
E1b1a1a1d is defined by a private marker M155. It is known from a single carrier in Mali.
E1b1a1a1e
E1b1a1a1e is defined by markers M10, M66, M156 and M195. Wairak people in Tanzania tested 4.6% (2/43) positive for E-M10. E-M10 was found in a single person of the Lissongo group in the Central African Republic and two members in a "Mixed" population from the Adamawa region.
E1b1a1a1f
E1b1a1a1f is defined by L485. The basal node E-L485* appears to be somewhat uncommon but has not been sufficiently tested in large populations. The ancestral L485 SNP (along with several of its subclades) was very recently discovered. Some of these SNPs have little or no published population data and/or have yet to receive nomenclature recognition by the YCC.
E1b1a1a1f1 is defined by marker L514. This SNP is currently without population study data outside of the 1000 Genomes Project.
E1b1a1a1f1a (YCC E1b1a7) is defined by marker M191/P86. Filippo et al. (2011) studied a number of African populations that were E-M2 positive and found the basal E-M191/P86 (without E-P252/U174) in a population of Gur speakers in Burkina Faso. Montano et al. (2011) found similar sparse distribution of E-M191* in Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon and Congo. M191/P86 positive samples occurred in tested populations of Annang (38.3%), Ibibio (45.6%), Efik (45%), and Igbo (54.3%) living in Nigeria, West Africa. E-M191/P86 appears in varying frequencies in Central and Southern Africa but almost all are also positive for P252/U174. Bantu-speaking South Africans (89/343) tested 25.9% positive and Khoe-San speaking South Africans tested 7.7% (14/183) positive for this SNP. It also appears commonly in Africans living in the Americas. A population in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil tested 9.2% (12/130) positive. 34.9% (29/83) of American Haplogroup E men tested positive for M191.
Veeramah et al. (2010) studies of the recombining portions of M191 positive Y chromosomes suggest that this lineage has "diffusely spread with multiple high frequency haplotypes implying a longer evolutionary period since this haplogroup arose". The subclade E1b1a1a1f1a appears to express opposite clinal distributions to E1b1a1* in the West African Savanna region. Haplogroup E1b1a1a1f1a (E-M191) has a frequency of 23% in Cameroon (where it represents 42% of haplotypes carrying the DYS271 mutation or E-M2), 13% in Burkina Faso (16% of haplotypes carrying the M2/DYS271 mutation) and only 1% in Senegal. Similarly, while E1b1a reaches its highest frequency of 81% in Senegal, only 1 of the 139 Senegalese that were tested showed M191/P86. In other words, as one moves to West Africa from western Central Africa, the less subclade E1b1a1f is found. "A possible explanation might be that haplotype 24 chromosomes [E-M2*] were already present across the Sudanese belt when the M191 mutation, which defines haplotype 22, arose in central western Africa. Only then would a later demic expansion have brought haplotype 22 chromosomes from central western to western Africa, giving rise to the opposite clinal distributions of haplotypes 22 and 24."
E1b1a1a1f1a1 (YCC E1b1a7a) is defined by P252/U174. It appears to be the most common subclade of E-L485. It is believed to have originated near western Central Africa. It is rarely found in the most western portions of West Africa. Montano et al. (2011) found this subclade very prevalent in Nigeria and Gabon. Filippo et al. (2011) estimated a tMRCA of ~4.2 kya from sample of Yoruba population positive for the SNP.
E1b1a1a1f1a1b (YCC E1b1a7a2) is defined by P115. This subclade has only been observed amongst Fang people of Central Africa.
E1b1a1a1f1a1c (YCC E1b1a7a3) is defined by P116. Montano et al. (2011) observed this SNP only in Gabon and a Bassa population from Cameroon.
E1b1a1a1f1a1d is defined by Z1704. This subclade has been observed across Africa. The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium found this SNP in Yoruba Nigerian, three Kenyan Luhyas and one African descent Puerto Rican.
E1b1a1a1f1b is defined by markers L515, L516, L517, and M263.2. This subclade was found by the researchers of Y-Chromosome Genome Comparison Project using data from the commercial bioinformatics company 23andMe.
E1b1a1a1g
E1b1a1a1g (YCC E1b1a8) is defined by marker U175. The basal E-U175* is extremely rare. Montano et al. (2011) only found one out of 505 tested African subjects who was U175 positive but negative for U209. Brucato et al. found similarly low frequencies of basal E-U175* in subjects in the Ivory Coast and Benin. Veeramah et al. (2010) found U175 in tested Annang (45.3%), Ibibio (37%), Efik (33.3%), and Igbo (25.3%) but did not test for U209.
The supposed "Bantu haplotype" found in E-U175 carriers is "present at appreciable frequencies in other Niger–Congo languages speaking peoples as far west as Guinea-Bissau". This is the modal haplotype of STR markers that is common in carriers of E-U175.
E1b1a1a1g has several subclades.
E1b1a1a1g1 (YCC E1b1a8a) is defined by U209. It is the most prominent subclade of U175. This subclade has very high frequencies of over fifty percentages in Cameroonian populations of Bassa and Bakaka, possibly indicating place of origin. However, E-U209 is widely found at lower frequencies in West and Central African countries surrounding Cameroon and Gabon. Brucato et al. (2010) found the SNP in a population of Ahizi (in the Ivory Coast) 38.8% (19/49), Yacouba (Ivory Coast) 27.5% (11/40), and Beninese 6.5% (5/77) respectively.
E1b1a1a1g1a (YCC E1b1a8a1) is defined by U290. The Montano et al. (2011) study of U290 showed a lower frequency in Nigeria (11.7%) and western Central Africa than basal node U209. The highest population frequency rate in that study was 57.7% (15/26) in Ewondo in Cameroon. 32.5% (27/83) of American Haplogroup E men tested by Sims et al. (2007) were positive for this SNP.
E1b1a1a1g1a2 is defined by Z1725. This marker has been observed by The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium in Yoruba Nigerians and Luhya Kenyans.
E1b1a1a1g1c (YCC E1b1a4) is defined by M154. A Bamilike population tested 31.3% (15/48) for the marker. Bakaka speakers from Cameroon tested 8%. An Ovimbundu test population found this SNP at 14% (14/100). Members of this subclade have also been found in South Africa.
E1b1a1a1g1d is defined by V39. Trombetta et al. first published this SNP in 2011 but gave little population data about it. It is only known to have been found in an African population.
E1b1a1a1h
E1b1a1a1h is defined by markers P268 and P269. It was first reported in a person from the Gambia.
Phylogenetics
Phylogenetic history
Prior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.
Research publications
The following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC tree.

Nelson Mandela was Y chromosomal haplogroup E1b1a-M2
Pharaoh Ramesses III & DNA
The Zink unit determined that the mummy of an unknown man buried with Ramesses was, because of the proven genetic relationship and a mummification process that suggested punishment, a good candidate for the pharaoh's son, Pentaweret, who was the only son to revolt against their father. It was impossible to determine their cause of death. Using Whit Athey's haplogroup predictor based on Y-STR values both mummies were predicted to share the Y chromosomal haplogroup E1b1a1-M2 and 50% of their genetic material, which pointed to a father-son relationship.

Alinda of the Loch is a children's fantasy novel written by Oonagh Jane Pope and Julie Ann Brown. The story is a fairy tale about the daughter of Sleeping Beauty, named Alinda. The result of a collaboration between a British primary school teacher and an American college professor, the novel was published by Across the Pond Publishing in 2009.
Plot summary
Alinda experiences a similar curse to the one cast on their mother; However, in this tale, the Shadow Fairy curses Alinda with a 500-year deep sleep. On their eighteenth birthday, Alinda falls asleep, and knowing that they will not be around when they are awakened, the King and Queen find a secure resting place for them and employ a young dragon named Nessie to keep watch of them for those five hundred years.
The story takes an unsuspecting turn when Alinda wakes up staring out of their glass topped bed to a young man named Grant. From this point, Alinda is introduced to an unfamiliar modern world with airplanes, cars, rock music and very different clothing styles.
Setting
Alinda of the Loch is set in Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, and the young dragon employed by Queen Aurora and King Colin to safeguard their young daughter is suspected to be the Loch Ness monster. Alinda of the Loch offers a unique approach to the story of Sleeping Beauty and the legend of the Loch Ness Monster.

The Society of SS. Peter and Paul (SSPP) was an English Anglo-Catholic publishing company, sometimes mistakenly thought to have been in the tradition of Anglican Papalism. It was established in 1911 as a reaction to the works of the Anglican priest and liturgist Percy Dearmer, particularly The Parson's Handbook which advocated a liturgical style allegedly distinct to England, and rooted in the Sarum rite.
The society believed that the Church of England should follow the ceremonial development of the Western (Roman) Church, using the eucharistic rite of the 1549 Book of Common Prayer "enriched ceremonially and ritually from parent sources", and that the best means to accomplish this was to produce missals and other prayer books to promote and facilitate this endeavour.
The SSPP worked closely with the ecclesiastical artist Martin Travers to produce the desired aesthetic for the movement.
The society was responsible for the Anglican Missal, a liturgical book still used by some Anglo-Catholics and other high-church Anglicans.

Zaqatala Governorate () — was an administrative division of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic from 1918 to 1920.
Background
After the collapse of the Russian Empire, 3 states at once claimed the former Zakatal Okrug - the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Created on March 20, 1917, the Zagatala District Executive Committee, which possessed practically all power in the region, prevented Georgia from establishing control over the district. On June 26, taking into account the impassable mountains between the Mountain Republic and the Okrug, the Zaqatala National Council, in view of the fact that “in terms of culture, economy, lifestyle, religion, as well as industry and language, Zagatala is of the same origin with Azerbaijan” on the entry of the Zaqatala district into Azerbaijan as a province. On the same day, according to the official chronology, the Zaqatala governorate of the Azerbaijan was created. On June 30, Zagatala district became the third (after Elisavetpol Governorate and Baku Governorate) governorate of Azerbaijan with 3,992.54 square kilometres of area. Its first governor was a Sunni Kumyk – Aliyar bek Hashimbekov.
However, the territorial dispute did not end, for example, according to Georgian laws, the Zaqatala district was considered an integral part of Georgia. From October 25 to November 2, 1919, a commission was operating to establish temporary boundaries between the Zaqatala province and the Signagi district of Georgia. The parties came to an agreement to resolve all issues exclusively by peaceful means.
History
On February 17, 1919, the Zaqatala province was judicially subordinated to the Ganja district court. On February 2, 1920, a male teachers' seminary was established in Zaqatala. The "Lezghi regiment", created by the Avars at the beginning of 1918 and transferred under the command of Aliaga Shikhlinsky on February 22 and was renamed the "Zaqatala regiment". The regiment participated in the Battle of Baku, in the Karabakh battles and the Zangezur offensive in November 1919 during Armenian-Azerbaijani War.
The main population of the governorate were Sunnis in opposition to the rest of Azerbaijan which were Shia. So in 1918, the Ahrar party was created in Baku, representing the interests of the Zaqatala province and the Sunnis in general. The representative of the party Aslan-bek Kardashev from April 14 to December 22, 1919, was the Minister of Agriculture of Azerbaijan. The party's print organ was the newspaper El, published in the Azerbaijani language. The region was represented by 8 deputies in the parliament.
Aliyar bek Hashimbekov's tenure was filled with disturbances and rivalries. Especially there was a tension with Georgian border guards. Their successor Mammad bek Shahmaliyev thought that armed conflict was inevitable. Georgian border guards captured Mazımçay border post very easily in September. During their tenure as governor, they often took leave for various reasons and did not take the necessary steps to protect the province. As a result, they were sacked from the post in January 1920.
The Ahrar reached its zenith when a member of the party – ethnic Avar, Bahadur Khan Malachikhanov was appointed as the new governor on January 16, 1920. In their new position, Malachikhanov actively contributed to ending civil strife between Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the region. In their first address to the population, the new head of the district demanded an end to various kinds of confrontation, maintain calm and warned that with any changes in the socio-political life of Azerbaijan, the current government will continue to lead the Zaqatala district. During their short term as Governor-General, they prevented several bloody tragedies.
Governorate was abolished after Soviet takeover of Azerbaijan. On May 7, 1920, a few days after the Sovietization of Azerbaijan, Soviet Russia signed the Moscow Treaty with Georgia, in which it recognized the former Zakatala District as the territory of Georgia in exchange for the Georgian government's refusal to obstruct the activities of the Communist Party of Georgia. Nevertheless, in June 1920, at a meeting with Kirov, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Georgia stated that the territory of the district was still controlled by the Azerbaijani Soviet troops.

New York Counterpoint for amplified clarinet and tape, or 9 clarinets and 3 bass clarinets (one part doubles B and bass), is a 1985 minimalist composition written by American composer Steve Reich. The piece, intended to capture the throbbing vibrancy of Manhattan, is notable for its ability to imitate electronic sounds through acoustic instrumentation.
History
The piece was commissioned in 1984 by clarinetist Richard Stoltzman for nine B-flat clarinets and three bass clarinets. This was the second in Reich's "counterpoint" series, preceded by Vermont Counterpoint (1982) for flutes, Electric Counterpoint (1987), for electric guitars and followed by Cello Counterpoint (2003), for celli. Each of these works are scored for one live performer who plays against up to a dozen recordings of the same instrument. The canonic interplay in the composition creates multiple layers of sound, akin to Reich's earlier phase pieces. Out of the series, New York Counterpoint is considered the most rhythmically intricate and one of Reich's most well known works. The second movement of the piece was featured as a set work for Edexcel music A level between 2005 and 2016
Composition
New York Counterpoint is divided into three movements known only by their suggested tempi: fast, slow and fast.
Movement I (Fast)
The opening ostinato derives from the opening of a similar Reich piece, Music for 18 Musicians (1976). Out of the synthetic pulses arises a simple melody which repeats in phase with other groupings of clarinets. The use of interlocking repeated melodic patterns, according to Reich, echoes their earlier works Piano Phase (1967) and Violin Phase (1967). The theme recapitulates the pulses in an identical harmonic progression. A larger pattern is seen here as the interlocking melodies and chordal pulses are too in phase. These resulting melodies or melodic patterns then become the basis for the following section as the other surrounding parts in the contrapuntal web fade out.
Movement II (Slow)
The second movement, while much slower, plays with the same ideas of phase shifting and melodic imitation. The persistent use of staggered repetition of melodic material is at the very heart of the movement's construction. In the nature of the patterns, the movements harmonic combination reflects the contemporaneously composed Sextet (1985). However, this movement's change of tempo is abrupt and halved, establishing an ambiguity between measured groupings. In this case, three groups of four eight notes, or four groups of three eight notes. Despite the ambiguity and phase, this movement is the most melodic of the three, making its presence strong as an interlude and catalyst for the bombastic finale.
Movement III (Fast)
The final movement of New York Counterpoint draws attention to the bass clarinets, which function to accent in prominence. The melody, presented in a slow six-eight, is sharply interrupted by an antiphonal hocket in the bass clarinet, first one and then the other while the upper clarinets remain similar. In the program notes, Reich claims that "the effect, by change of accent, is to vary the perception of that which in fact is not changing." This movement, while less focused on the obvious theme of phase and drone, takes both elements from the previous movements and slyly incorporates them into the bass clarinet line.

Peter W. Smith (February 23, 1936 – May 14, 2017) was an American investment banker who had a 40-year career managing corporate acquisitions and venture investments. They were active in Republican politics. In 1998, they were identified as a major financial supporter of the 1993 Troopergate story, in which several Arkansas state troopers accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of having carried out sexual dalliances while they were Governor of Arkansas. In 2017, they confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that they (along with former national security advisor Michael Flynn) had tried in 2016 to contact computer hackers, including Russian hackers, in an attempt to obtain opposition research material to use against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Ten days after speaking to the paper, they committed suicide in a Minnesota hotel room, citing ill health.
Education
Smith earned a BS in electrical engineering from Northeastern University. They went on to earn an MBA from the University of Notre Dame.
Career
From 1969 to 1980 they were a senior officer at Field Enterprises, Inc. From 1975 to 1997 they were president of their own firm, Peter W. Smith & Company, specializing in buyout transactions. From 1997 to 2014 they were Managing Member of DigaComm, LLC where they primarily managed early venture investments. At the time of their death they were Chairman Emeritus of Corporate Venture Alliances, LLC.
Political involvement
They were a national chairperson of the College Young Republicans. They were a board member and officer of the Atlantic Council of the United States and was also active with the Heritage Foundation, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Brookings Institution. They were a contributor and fundraiser for the Republican National Committee and GOPAC as well as individual candidates. Smith was a major donor to Newt Gingrich's GOPAC, giving over $100,000 from 1989 to 1995—a sum which made them one of GOPAC's top 20 donors.
In December 1993, two Arkansas state troopers publicly claimed that they and other troopers had been used to facilitate and conceal multiple extra-marital affairs of then-Governor Bill Clinton. The stories were published in an article by then-conservative author David Brock in the American Spectator and also in a series of articles in the Los Angeles Times. Smith had arranged for the troopers to meet Brock. In February 1994 Smith started a "Troopergate Whistle Blower Fund" to provide support for the troopers and pay their attorney fees; the fund ultimately raised about $40,000. Altogether Smith said they spent about $80,000 on the case, including a $5,000 payment to Brock. Smith described their donations as an independent effort to encourage anti-Clinton stories in the mainstream press.
Several emails sent by Smith to the Illinois Republican Party turned up among those hacked from party computers and posted on DCLeaks, which U.S. intelligence officials believe to be an outlet for the foreign military intelligence agency of Russia, GRU. The emails were about a 2015 congressional election.
In May 2017 Smith told Shane Harris of the Wall Street Journal that they had been actively involved, during the 2016 presidential election campaign, trying to obtain emails they believed had been deleted from Hillary Clinton's computer server. Smith stated, "We knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government" and told various internet groups to give any emails to Wikileaks. To act as a vehicle for their efforts, Smith established the Delaware-based firm KLS Research LLC on September 2, 2016, and opened a bank account for KLS at Northern Trust where they also had a personal account. For advice on obtaining Clinton's emails and with support from Smith's assistant Jonathan Safron, Smith and their associate John Szobocsan contacted several experts in cybersecurity including Eric York, Matt Tait, the consulting firm Flynn Intel Group associated with Michael G. Flynn and their father Michael Flynn with whom Smith had established a business together in November 2015 immediately after Flynn retired from the Army. Smith reached out to Guccifer 2.0 and Charles Johnson suggested that Smith contact Andrew Auernheimer alias Weev. According to the Mueller Report, Trump campaign advisor Mike Flynn contacted Smith shortly after July 27, 2016, when Trump had publicly invited "Russia" to find the missing emails, and asked Smith to look for them. In that quest Smith contacted several known hacker groups, including some Russian groups. They were shown some information but was not convinced it was genuine, and suggested the hackers give it to WikiLeaks instead. As part of this effort, Smith donated $150,000 to "the Washington Scholarship Fund for the Russian students", including $100,000 of solicited money and $50,000 from their personal funds.
Smith was close to Sam Clovis.
They maintained a blog called Peter W. Smith.
Personal life and death
Smith lived in Lake Forest, Illinois. They were married to Janet; the couple had three children and three grandchildren at the time of their death.
Smith died on May 14, 2017, in a hotel room in Rochester, Minnesota. They had checked into the hotel, which is near the Mayo Clinic, the day after speaking to the Wall Street Journal. Nine days later they were found with a bag over their head that was attached to a helium source. Medical records list Smith's cause of death as "asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in confined space with helium." Police discovered a suicide note by Smith that stated "no foul play whatsoever", and that they were in poor health and their life insurance policy was about to expire.

Willi Steffen (17 March 1925 – 3 May 2005) was a Swiss international footballer who played as a left-back.
Steffen started out as an amateur with Cantonal Neuchâtel and later became the first Swiss footballer to play in England when they signed for Chelsea. They had only journeyed to England to learn the language, having been sent by their parents in preparation for them joining the family's fruit and vegetable business, but their teacher turned out to be the wife of then-Chelsea manager, Billy Birrell. They were given a trial and signed for the club in July 1946.
Steffen was a cultured and dedicated full back, tall and pacy, who quickly became a crowd favourite at Chelsea, while their blonde hair and good looks also won them admirers. They made their debut in a 3–1 loss against Derby County and played 20 league and cup games for Chelsea during the 1946-47 season, including a memorable FA Cup win over Arsenal at Highbury, during which they expertly marked winger Ian McPherson. Steffen returned to Switzerland at the end of the season to finish their national service and was made club captain in their final game for Chelsea, also against Derby.
Upon their return to Switzerland they re-joined Cantonal before moving to Young Boys Bern in 1950. With them, they won the Swiss Super League four years in succession from 1957-60 as well as the Schweizer Cup in 1953 and 1958.
A former fighter pilot, Steffen played for Switzerland at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, though they went out in the group stages. They also played in a 1–0 win over an England side containing Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Billy Wright in Zurich in 1947. They won 28 international caps for their country.
They died in Bern in 2005, aged 80.

It was the first library in the United States specifically planned to serve undergraduates. Women (that is, Radcliffe College students) were admitted beginning in 1967.
Overview
Lamont was built as part of a program to address dwindling stack space, and patron overcrowding, at Widener Library. Keyes D. Metcalf, Librarian of Harvard College and Director of the Harvard University Library from 1937 to 1955, planned the building with Boston architect Henry R. Shepley. Opened in 1949, it is named for its principal donor, Harvard alumnus Thomas W. Lamont.
Lamont's general collection of 200,000 volumes began with transfers from Widener, the Boylston Hall reserve-book collections, and the Harvard Union Reading Room. A modified Dewey classification scheme was used, and the main spaces included capacious open-shelf alcoves for browsing, study, and research. The Library of Congress Classification system was adopted in the 1970s.
After Littauer Library closed in 2007, Lamont became the home library for HCL's former Social Sciences Program. Four units of the Social Sciences ProgramDocuments Services, Microform Services, Numeric Data Services, and Environmental Information Serviceswere combined with Lamont Reference Services. Lamont houses the College Library's major research collections in government documents and microform collections across all disciplines.

Brendan Wood Ryan (born March 26, 1982) is an American former professional baseball infielder. They played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels.
Ryan was a shortstop but was a versatile enough defender that they made professional appearances at every position but catcher. The 2012 winner of the Fielding Bible Award, Ryan had a reputation as one of the best defensive players in baseball.
Early and personal life
Ryan was born in Los Angeles on March 26, 1982, to Katie and Jim Ryan.  They are the youngest of their four children. Ryan attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. Their father was an infielder for Loyola Marymount University and holds the school's single-season record for the most hits with a wooden bat. One of their uncles, Willie Ryan, was a National Champion First Team All-American first baseman for the USC Trojans baseball team; their other uncle, Dr. Patrick Ryan, was a college sprinter at UCLA and Michigan State.
College career
In the fall of 2000, Ryan enrolled at Lewis–Clark State College to play college baseball in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In their first season, they batted .375 with 5 triples, the third most ever by a Warrior. As a sophomore shortstop, they hit .359 with 34 RBIs and hit .378 with runners on. During the 2002 season, they hit safely in 18 straight games. Beyond their solid offensive numbers, Ryan gained a reputation as a good defensive infielder.
In the 2002 summer season, Brendan played collegiate summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks in the Alaska Baseball League.
Professional career
In 2003, Ryan entered the MLB amateur draft and was selected in the seventh round (215th overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals.
Ryan hit .311 for the Cardinals' rookie league affiliate, the New Jersey Cardinals, in 2003. In 2004, they were promoted to the Cardinals' Class A affiliate, the Peoria Chiefs. With a .322 batting average and 30 steals in the 2004 season, another promotion came for Ryan, this time to the High A Class team, the Palm Beach Cardinals, where Ryan was selected as a Florida State League All-Star. They were promoted again during the middle of 2005 season to the Class AA Springfield Cardinals.
In 2006, Ryan suffered a wrist injury in spring training limiting them to 28 games spread among four stops in the minors. That same year, Ryan appeared in 28 games for the Peoria Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League and batted .310 (39-for-126) with two home runs, 19 runs and 20 RBI. Their 39 hits were tied for tops for the 2006 AFL season. They collected two four-hit games and hit safely in their first eight AFL games (.425 BA) and 10 of their first 11 (.396).
St. Louis Cardinals
Ryan was originally called up on and made their major league debut for the Cardinals on June 2, 2007, against the Houston Astros. They were later sent down on July 27, 2007, but was recalled on August 12, 2007, and remained with the Cardinals for the rest of the season. In their rookie year, they hit for a .289 batting average with 4 home runs and 11 runs batted in. Ryan also scored 29 runs and recorded 7 stolen bases without being caught stealing. They batted significantly better against left-handed pitching in their first season with a batting average of .354, as opposed to their .232 average against right-handers. Their first major league home run was a game-winner in the top of the 11th inning off of Scott Schoeneweis of the New York Mets on June 26, 2007. Their second home run also came rather dramatically, as they contributed to a four run comeback on July 4, 2007 when the Cardinals were at one point behind 4–1. The Cardinals won the game 5–4 against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Ryan opened the 2008 season on the 15-day disabled list with a right oblique strain suffered in spring training. They rehabbed injury in the minor leagues in the first month of the season until called up on April 23. They were the Cardinals' primary utility infielder for the most of the season, although they played three games in the outfield. They were optioned to Memphis on August 6 and recalled again on September 2.
Ryan started the 2009 season in St. Louis. They went on the 15-day disabled from April 30 through May 15 with a left hamstring strain, making a rehab stint in Memphis. By June, they moved up to be the everyday shortstop, batting over .300 and playing spectacular defense. On August 20, 2009, in the second inning of the Cardinals and Padres Game, Ryan hit their first career grand slam off of San Diego pitcher Tim Stauffer. On September 19, 2009, Ryan hit a walk off single off Chicago Cubs closer Carlos Mármol. Ryan also had a home run in the 2–1 win. Their game-winning single was the first walk-off hit of their career.
By the end of the 2009 regular season, Ryan's defense at shortstop had been recognized as a major factor in the Cardinals' divisional title. However, in February 2010, they underwent a procedure to debride dead tissue from their right wrist performed by Dr. Steven Shin in Los Angeles. The start to their 2010 spring training debut was delayed due to the surgery. They made their 2010 Grapefruit League debut on March 20, but they showed no lingering effects.
Seattle Mariners
On December 12, 2010, Ryan was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Maikel Cleto.
On July 26, 2011, Ryan broke up CC Sabathia's bid for a perfect game with a base hit with one out in the seventh inning.
On August 2, 2011, during a game against the Oakland Athletics, alert play by Ryan led to the unusual result of theirs reaching third on an infield hit. Ryan hit a ground ball fielded by Oakland shortstop Eric Sogard, but Sogard was left off-balance and their throw to first was late. Behind the back of Oakland first baseman Conor Jackson, Ryan ran for second which was left uncovered by Sogard, and then immediately for third as that base was also uncovered. While referred to in the media as an "infield triple", the play was officially scored as a single and fielder's choice.
In 2011, Ryan finished second for the second straight year in the voting for the Fielding Bible Award.
On April 21, 2012, Ryan was the final out of Philip Humber's perfect game. They were called for a swinging third strike on a checked swing, though the ball was not caught cleanly. Rather than running to first base, Ryan momentarily argued umpire Brian Runge's decision that they had swung, allowing catcher A. J. Pierzynski to throw the ball to first base for the final out. On June 8, they entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth inning of the Mariners' combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers and made one of the game's closest putouts by throwing Dee Gordon out at first base. On August 15 of that same year, they scored the game's only run in the third inning of teammate Félix Hernández's perfect game, the Mariners defeating the Tampa Bay Rays.
In 2012, they won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding shortstop in MLB. In 2013, Ryan was replaced as the starting shortstop by Brad Miller mid-season, as Ryan had been hitting around the Mendoza Line.
New York Yankees
On September 10, 2013, Ryan was traded to the New York Yankees for a player to be named later. On November 18, 2013, they agreed to a new contract with the New York Yankees, and on November 27, 2013, they finalized a deal worth $5 million over two years. Their deal also includes a club option for $2 million, and a player option for $1 million, for the 2016 season.
Ryan opened the 2014 season on the 15-day disabled list with back issues. As of May 2, 2014, they were on the 15-day disabled list with cervical spine nerve damage and was playing rehab games at AA Trenton. Ryan played only 49 games in 2014, batting .167 with 8 RBI.
Ryan began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list due to a right calf strain. On August 25, 2015, Ryan made their MLB pitching debut in the eighth inning against the Houston Astros, throwing two scoreless innings.
Ryan exercised their $1 million player option for the 2016 season.
Chicago Cubs
On December 17, 2015, the Yankees officially announced that Ryan had been the player to be named later in their trade with the Chicago Cubs for shortstop Starlin Castro. They were released by the Cubs on December 23, 2015.

On February 2, 2016, the Washington Nationals signed Ryan to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. They did not make the team, but accepted an assignment to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League.
Los Angeles Angels
Following an injury to Andrelton Simmons, Ryan was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, in exchange for cash considerations and a player to be named later, on May 10, 2016. They were designated for assignment on May 28, but was called back up on June 1.
Detroit Tigers
On December 19, 2016, Ryan signed a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers, worth $625,000, which included an invite to spring training. They elected free agency on November 6, 2017.

Winchester (also known as Winchester: The House That Ghosts Built) is a 2018 supernatural horror film directed by Michael and Peter Spierig, and written by the Spierigs and Tom Vaughan. The film stars Helen Mirren as heiress Sarah Winchester, with Jason Clarke and Sarah Snook, and follows Winchester as they are haunted by spirits inside their San Jose mansion in 1906.
An American-Australian co-production, the film was released in the United States on February 2, 2018 and in Australia on February 22, 2018. The film received negative reviews from critics, who called it "dull" and "pointless”, but was a box office success, grossing $44 million worldwide against a $3.5 million budget. At the 39th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated in four categories, including Worst Picture and Worst Actress for Mirren, but failed to "win" any awards.
Plot
Sarah Winchester is the widow of famed gun manufacturer William Wirt Winchester. Them husband's sudden death and the previous death of their child Annie have left them in grief. Having received more than twenty million dollars in inheritance, Winchester convinces themselves they are cursed by the ghosts of those who died at the hands of Winchester firearms. After seeking advice from a medium, they begin building an enormous, seemingly never-ending mansion in San Jose, California that would eventually be named the Winchester Mystery House. The house is under constant construction and Sarah's niece Marion Marriott lives in the house with their son Henry. At night, Henry is possessed by a mysterious entity.
In 1906, the Winchester company hires Doctor Eric Price to stay at the house and assess Sarah, believing they are mentally unfit to remain in charge of the company. Eric is grieving from the death of their wife Ruby and is reliant on drugs. They arrive at the house and has a ghostly vision that they believe is a side-effect of the drugs they have taken. Later, they spot a ghost in the basement and witnesses a possessed Henry jump off the roof. Eric saves him.
The next day, Eric begins to conduct their assessment of Sarah's mental well-being. Sarah admits their fear of ghosts and believes they can help them move on. They reveal that they know about Eric's drug problem and confiscates their supply of laudanum. That night, Eric witnesses a seemingly possessed Sarah draw a plan for a new room.  They are startled by an entity and flees back to their room. The next day, Sarah shows Eric that they keep records of people killed by Winchester rifles. It is revealed that Eric had actually been shot and killed by a Winchester rifle before being revived, and they keep the refurbished bullet with him. Sarah explains how thirteen nails keep spirits sealed in rooms.
A possessed Henry attempts to kill Sarah with a rifle, but is stopped by Eric and Marion. Realizing how violent this spirit is, Sarah sends their staff away and decides to personally remove the ghost from their home. Eric encounters a butler who reveals themselves to be a ghost. They and Sarah identify the ghost as Benjamin Block, a Confederate States Army soldier who lost their two brothers in the American Civil War, killed by Winchester rifles. A devastated Ben proceeded to shoot up a Winchester office, massacring the workers before being shot dead by police. Ben has been the one possessing Henry; the constructed room with the Winchester guns is the room where they were shot dead.
The 1906 San Francisco earthquake takes place, devastating the house and separating Eric and Sarah. In the chaos, a possessed Henry escapes their room and is pursued by Marion. Eric encounters several ghosts before seeing the ghost of Ruby their wife. It is revealed that Ruby could see and hear ghosts but was misdiagnosed as "delusional" by Eric. Depressed that they would not believe her, the unstable Ruby shot Eric before killing themselves with a Winchester rifle. Ruby's ghost comforts Eric, inspiring them to help Sarah. Eric reunites with Sarah and they manage to trap Ben in the room. Marion and Henry are cornered by Ben's brothers. Ben attempts to murder Sarah, but the pair realizes that Ben is scared of the bullet Eric kept. Eric has been able to see the ghosts in the house due to their dying from that bullet beforehand. Eric uses the bullet in the rifle that Ben used in the shooting and banishes him. Henry and Marion are saved and the other spirits return to their rooms.
Eric pronounces Sarah sane, allowing them to remain in control of the company. Sarah announces their intent to build more rooms to help more spirits. As the house is being repaired, the camera returns to view the hall of boarded up rooms and catches a nail falling out of one of the boards that is sealing a spirit in a room.

Critical response

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale.
Varietys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a negative review, writing, "Mirren does all they can to look like she's having fun, but Winchester...[is] an empty grab bag of a spook show in which the Spierig brothers never do figure out a way to turn the Winchester Mystery House into an exhilarating movie set...".
Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review, saying that "Winchester is a visual treat, its palette aglow with bronze and turquoise tints that suggest colorized Victorian postcards," but "it "promises more sophisticated shocks and psychological depths than it ultimately delivers."
Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating, "Winchester leveled my unfair expectations simply by being both silly and fun... what [it] lacks in originality its creators amply make up for in execution." They also stated that the dialogue was "enjoyable."
In January 2019, it was nominated for several Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Actress.
