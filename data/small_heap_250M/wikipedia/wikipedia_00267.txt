Gender sensitivity is the process by which people are made aware of how gender plays a role in life through their treatment of others. Gender relations are present in all institutions and gender sensitivity especially manifests in recognizing privilege and discrimination around gender; women are generally seen as disadvantaged in society. Gender sensitivity trainings are used to educate people, usually employees, to become more aware of and sensitive to gender in their lives or workplaces. They are becoming more popular in the United States, particularly in areas of the service industry, such as healthcare and education.
Gender sensitivity in reproductive health
Gender sensitivity in reproductive health is reliant on treating all clients with equal respect, regardless of sex, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, or age. Indicators of gender-sensitive service include: refraining from discriminating against or stereotyping clients on the basis of sex or gender, treating all clients with equal respect, offering gender sensitivity training to all employees, and providing adequate representation of female care providers. Gender-sensitive care also depends on informed consent to treatment for all clients. If service providers deliver gender-sensitive care, their clients might be more likely to seek further service from that provider.
Gender sensitization and children
Gender sensitivity is enacted through a process known as gender sensitization. Gender sensitization promotes equality for men and women by allowing men and women to view what is stereotypical of and reasonable for their gender. Therefore, teachers are in a position to teach children about gender sensitization through how they conduct their classroom and interact with their students. Teachers who are successful at sensitizing their students to gender at a young age can influence a change in children's thought processes, which positions them to break societal stigmas in childhood and throughout life.
Teaching children to be sensitive to gender also relies heavily on the parents or guardians of the children. Children begin to develop their gender identity around two to three years old. At this age, gender identity is reinforced through messages from parents, whether gender sensitive or not. A common phrase that is not gender sensitive and might be heard by young children through their parents is “boys will be boys.” Other examples of non-gender-sensitive reinforcement of gender includes teaching children that pink is an objectively feminine color and blue is an objectively masculine color, as well as influencing young girls to play with dolls and boys to play with trucks. Educating children about gender identities that do not conform to the gender binary helps to break the stigma associated with these identities.
Global gender sensitivity
Gender plays a large role in Indian thought processes. The separation of boy and girl indicators in India creates distance between men and women. Indicators of masculinity in boys include cars, the color blue, and superheroes; indicators of femininity in girls include dolls, the color pink, and princesses.
Sweden is making a strong effort to become more gender sensitive. Sweden recently added the word “hen”—a gender-neutral pronoun—to their common language. This promotes a gender-neutral way of thinking for children.

Cormac Oge Laidir MacCarthy, 10th Lord of Muskerry (1447–1536) was an Irish chieftain, styled Lord of Muskerry. In 1520 he defeated James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond in the battle of Mourne Abbey.
Birth and origins
Cormac was born in 1447, most likely at Kilcrea Castle, residence of his parents. He was the son of Cormac Laidir MacCarthy and his wife Mary Fitzmaurice. His father was the 9th Lord of Muskerry. His father's family were the MacCarthys of Muskerry, a Gaelic Irish dynasty that had branched from the MacCarthy-Mor line in the 14th century when a younger son received Muskerry as appanage.
His mother was a daughter of Edmund Fitzmaurice, 8th Baron of Kerry, also called Baron Lixnaw instead of Baron Kerry.
Marriage and children
MacCarthy married Catherine, daughter of John Barry, 1st Viscount Buttevant.
Cormac and Catherine had five sons:
Teige (1472–1565), his successor
Diarmaid
Eoghan
Callaghan (Ceallachan)
Cormac
—and two daughters:
Mary, married James FitzGerald, de jure 12th Earl of Desmond, called "Court Page"
Julia, married three times. First Gerald Fitzmaurice, 15th Baron Kerry (died 1550), secondly Cormac na Haoine MacCarthy Reagh (1490–1567), and thirdly Edmund Butler, 1st/11th Baron Dunboyne (died 1566)
10th Lord of Muskerry
MacCarthy's father was killed in 1495 by his brother Owen, MacCarthy's uncle, who usurped the lordship. In 1498 MacCarthy, with help from Thomas FitzThomas FitzGerald, future 11th Earl of Desmond, killed Owen. The succession was however denied to him by Cormac, another uncle, for three more years until he succeeded in deposing Cormac in 1501 and eventually acceded as 10th Lord of Muskerry. These two uncles are not counted as lords of Muskerry.
Battle of Mourne
In September 1520 Muskerry and Donal MacCarthy Reagh helped Thomas FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Desmond, defeat James FitzMaurice FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond in the battle of Mourne. Donal MacCarthy Reagh had married Muskerry's sister Ellen.
In December, together with Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond, they besieged James FitzMaurice FitzGerald, in Dungarvan.
Death
Muskerry died in 1536 at Kilcrea Castle and was buried in the friary.

Uruguayan Antarctica () is the sector of Antarctica where Professor Julio César Musso believes the Oriental Republic of Uruguay should exercise its sovereignty. It was not assigned a specific definition nor meant a territorial claim, but rather was intended as an area of natural action of the southern maritime projection of Uruguay. Uruguay is part of the Antarctic Treaty System as a consulting member, and it reserved the right to make a territorial claim.
Uruguayan Antarctica Day
Bill of 1985
On May 8, 1985, then-Senator Luis Alberto Lacalle introduced a new bill in order to point a day in the year as the "Uruguayan Antarctica Day" (Día de la Antártida Uruguaya) and promote the study and dissemination of the issue among the younger generations. In the preamble, Lacalle argued that "we have chosen the 28th of August, as the foundation of the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute, inspired by the teachings of Professor Julio C. Musso, has been the area where the Antarctic vocation of our country was born and raised."

Sudan first participated at the Olympic Games in 1960, and has sent athletes to compete in most Summer Olympic Games since then. The nation did not attend the 1964 Games, boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics along with most African nations, and participated in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. The nation has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games.
Ismail Ahmed Ismail, who came second in the men's 800 m in 2008, was the first Sudanese athlete to win an Olympic medal.
The National Olympic Committee for Sudan was created in 1956 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1959.

Ustadz Wahab M. Akbar (April 16, 1960 – November 13, 2007) was a Filipino politician who served three terms as governor of Basilan, during which time he was known for his "eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth" policy for dealing with kidnappers and terrorists in the province. He was later elected as congressman for the lone district of Basilan in the House of Representatives, but was one of 4 people killed in a bomb attack at the Batasang Pambansa. Police publicly suspected the attack was directed at him by political opponents.
Life
Wahab Akbar was born in Lantawan, Basilan where his father, Hadji Mohtamad Salajin, served as the town's first mayor. At age 11 Akbar joined his father to fight in the mountains, but after three years Salajin was persuaded to join the government and was appointed mayor of Lantawan by President Ferdinand Marcos.
He studied agriculture at Gregorio Araneta University (now De La Salle Araneta University), but did not finish. A member of the Liberal Party, Akbar was first elected governor of Basilan in the 1998 elections. He was reelected in 2001 and 2004.
Akbar was constitutionally barred from seeking a fourth consecutive term as governor. Instead, he successfully sought election to the Congress, representing the lone district of his home province. One of his wives won the election to succeed him as governor. Another of his wives is mayor of the provincial capital, Isabela City; A third wife ran, and lost, the race to be mayor of another city in Basilan.
He was strongly suspected of having ties with the Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic extremist group linked to Al Qaeda, with some reports even claiming that he was a founding member and a commander until a falling-out with the group.
Personal life
He was married to first wife Jum Jainnudin, second wife, Cherry Lyn Santos, third wife Nur-in Akbar, fourth wife Marietta Zamoranos, and fifth wife (who is Syrian).
Death
On November 13, 2007, Akbar died at the Far Eastern University - Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation Medical Center from injuries sustained following an explosion at the House of Representatives in the Batasang Pambansa complex. The blast also immediately killed the driver of another legislator. Three other congressional staff members would die from blast injuries, including one of Akbar's own aides.
According to National Capital Region Police Office chief, Director Geary Barias, Akbar could have been the target of the bombing, since his vehicle bore the brunt of the damage.
The next day, his body was brought to Basilan for his burial. He was buried in front of his mansion which was still under construction.
Writ of Habeas Corpus
On December 14, 2007, in 2-page resolution, the Supreme Court of the Philippines issued a writ of habeas corpus on petition of suspects Caidar Aunal, Adham Kusain, and Ikram Indama. It required the Philippine National Police's (PNP) Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), National Capital Region-Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit (NCR-CIDU) and the PNP Custodial Center to file returns before Quezon City Regional Trial Court Executive Judge Romeo Zamora on December 18. However, the family suspected that the head of the killing was close ally of Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III, Mujiv Hataman, Former Anak Mindanao Representative and Current ARMM Regional Governor.

oskar is a gene required for the development of the Drosophila embryo. It defines the posterior pole during early embryogenesis. Its two isoforms, short and long, play different roles in Drosophila embryonic development. oskar was named after the main character from the Günter Grass novel The Tin Drum, who refuses to grow up.
Evolutionary history
oskar displays a unique evolutionary origin resulting from a Horizontal Domain Transfer from a probably bacterial endosymbiont onto an ancestral insect genome. The OSK domain is of bacterial origin and fused with the LOTUS domain through a linker domain. This event must have happened just prior to the divergence with the Crustacean, the insect's sister group, as oskar can be found as early as the Zygentoma but does not seem to exist in Crustacean.
Translational-level regulation
oskar is translationally repressed prior to reaching the posterior pole of the oocyte by Bruno, which binds to three bruno response elements (BREs) on the 3' end of the transcribed oskar mRNA. The Bruno inhibitor has two distinct modes of action: recruiting the Cup eIF4E binding protein, which is also required for oskar mRNA localization due to interactions with the Barentsz microtubule-linked transporter, and promoting oligomerization of oskar mRNA. Oskar mRNA harbours a stem-loop structure in the 3'UTR, called the oocyte entry signal (OES), that promotes dynein-based mRNA accumulation in the oocyte.
P granule formation
oskar plays role in recruiting other germ line genes to the germ plasm for PGC (primordial germ cell) specification. oskar mRNA locates to the posterior end of an oocyte and, once translated, the short isoform of oskar (Short oskar) recruits germ plasm components such as the protein Vasa and the RNA-binding proteins of the Piwi family, among many others. The long isoform of oskar (Long oskar) has been implicated in creating an actin network on the posterior pole end.
A second role has been discovered that relates to the formation of P granules, or germ granules. These ribonucleoprotein granules are found in every species' germ line cells. Although they are mobile, they typically localize to the nuclei and sit on nuclear pores. This positioning makes them ideal mRNA regulators, as the mRNA must pass through to exit the nucleus. Translational regulation also makes sense due to the granules' close association with ribosomes. These P granules are phase-transition entities, which means that they can display both liquid-like and hydrogel-like properties. This allows them to be very versatile structures, able to dissolve, condense, and exchange their protein content with their environment at will. Recent studies have shown that the short isoform of oskar has another function as the nucleator of nuclear germ granules. oskar recruits vasa to these round granules, then promotes the localization to the nucleus. oskar was ablated to explore the function of these nuclear germ granules. The results showed that the division of PGCs was compromised without oskar, meaning that the P granules play a role in the cell cycle of germ cells. It is still unclear exactly how the nuclear granules interact with certain factors and what factors (proteins, regulators, inhibitors) they interact with in order to regulate cell division.
Domain families
oskar contains two RNA-binding protein domains: the OSK RNA-binding domain and the OST-HTH/LOTUS domain. The former is structurally related to SGNH hydrolases but lack the active site residues. The latter is a winged helix-turn-helix domain also found in human TDRD5/TDRD7. The OST-HTH domain in oskar is mainly responsible for recruiting the Vasa helicase by binding to it.

'Penelope' was the code word given to a draft text of the EU Constitution prepared for the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, in 2001. The text was named after Penelope, the wife of Odysseus in Greek Mythology, who was perpetually spinning a web which she never completed.
History
After the creation of the European Single Currency, the European Commission decided that the EU should have a single constitution to replace the existing ad hoc system of multilateral treaties. The Convention on the Future of Europe, or the European Convention, was created by the European Council in December 2001 in order to propose a draft constitution for the European Union.
The Commission wanted to create an expanded system of Qualified Majority Voting to allow for more expediency in decision making.
In a speech in Strasbourg in May 2002, Romano Prodi stated that the proposed reforms had a further intention: 'As regards the institutions, our proposals have a clear aim: to define more clearly who does what in the European Union. In other words, who is accountable politically and institutionally for action undertaken.' (emphasis in original)
However, the European Convention did not lead to agreement on a possible Constitution. According to a 2005 review of the treaty reform process:
"Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the chair of the Praesidium, made clear at an early stage his lack of sympathy for the Commission and for its President's ambition that it should become the government of Europe, suggesting that it had served purpose in establishing the single market."
The European Commission presented two communications to the Convention in 2002 laying out its policy preferences for a future constitution. These communications left out discussion of the architecture of European institutions until after the 2002 Irish Referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
Prodi signalled his intention to influence the 'listening phase' of the Treaty consultations by creating the 'Penelope Group', "a small group of senior officials to prepare a draft Constitution in secret (European Commission, 2002c), which would be submitted to the Convention in the beginning of the ‘drafting phase'."
However, the existence of the Penelope Group led to a disagreement with Valéry Giscard D'Estaing, the chair of the Convention, who saw it as undermining his work. Secondly, "the ‘Penelope' draft was leaked to Le Monde and newspapers in Germany, Italy and Spain only hours before the official December document (European Commission, 2002b) was approved by the college (Norman, 2003, 165). The appearance of two texts, virtually simultaneously, seriously undermined the commission's credibility, even if there was little difference in their substance."
The Penelope Project document was seen by critics as an attempt to increase the importance and power of the Commission relative to the Parliament and Council, but the outcome of the treaty process saw the creation of the office of President of the European Union, rather than increasing the powers of the President of the commission.

The Großer Preis von Berlin, formerly known as the Deutschland-Preis, is a Group 1 flat horse race in Germany open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Hoppegarten over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July or August.
History
The event was established in 1888, and it was originally staged at Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin. It was initially contested over 2,000 metres, and was extended to 2,200 metres in 1897. It was transferred to Grunewald and increased to 2,400 metres in 1909. A new distance of 2,600 metres was introduced in 1927.
The race returned to Hoppegarten in 1934, and it was renamed the Grosser Preis der Reichshauptstadt in 1937. From this point it was run over 2,400 metres, and it reverted to 2,600 metres in 1943.
The event switched to Düsseldorf and was renamed the Grosser Preis von Nordrhein-Westfalen in 1947. That year's running was over 2,400 metres, and it returned to 2,600 metres in 1948. Its current period over 2,400 metres began in 1965.
The present race grading system was introduced in Germany in 1972, and the Grosser Preis von Nordrhein-Westfalen was classed at Group 1 level. Its original title, the Grosser Preis von Berlin, was restored in 1977.
The event became known as the Deutschland-Preis in 1996. It was held at Hamburg and merged with the Hansa-Preis in 2010. It returned to Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin in 2011.

The African piculet (Sasia africana), sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Verreauxia, is a species of bird in the family Picidae.
It is found in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, and Uganda. This species is described as locally common and has a very large range, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of "least concern".
Description
The African piculet is a small bird some long. The male has a chestnut or reddish forehead and a greyish-green or olive-green crown whereas the forehead in the female is the same colour as the crown. The rest of the upper parts are rather dark green tinged with yellow. The wings and tail are brownish-black. The throat and breast are darkish grey and the belly is a slightly paler grey. The beak is black, the eye red and the legs reddish. The juvenile is similar to the adult but has grey or buffy tones mixed into the general hue of the plumage.
Ecology
The habitat of the African piculet is mainly lowland secondary forest. It is an active bird often seen flitting from place to place in pairs or threesomes, and sometimes joining mixed species flocks. It forages through the lower storeys of trees, bushes and dense vegetation. It is a relative of the woodpecker, and despite its small size, hammers its beak into branches and splits stems to get at beetle larvae. It also gleans other insects but seems uninterested in ants. Breeding has been observed between June and February in various parts of its range. The nest is built within five metres of the ground and the clutch size is usually two. Both parents are involved in raising the young.

Vernon Wynne Evans (January 5, 1895 – 1975) was an American politician and educator from Saugus, Massachusetts who served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Superintendent of the Saugus Public Schools, and as a member of the Saugus Board of Selectmen.
Early life
Evans was born on January 5, 1895 in Saugus. He attended Boston University and worked as a journalist before entering politics. He served as a field artillery officer in France during World War I.
Massachusetts House of Representatives
From 1920 to 1924, Evans represented the 13th Essex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. First elected at the age of 21, he was the youngest person ever elected to the Massachusetts General Court. In 1924, he was a candidate for State Senate in the Seventh Middlesex District, but lost in the Republican primary to Charles P. Howard.
In 1925, he was elected to the Saugus Board of Selectmen. During his tenure on the board, Evans and fellow selectman C. F. Nelson Pratt paid out of pocket for repairs to a bridge frequently used by Saugus residents that the town could not pay to fix because it was on private property. He also led an effort to make the Board of Selectmen an unpaid board.
Saugus public schools
Principal
From 1922 to 1930, Evans was submaster of Saugus High School. On August 29, 1930 he was promoted to principal following the departure of Robert R. Webber. As principal, Evans pushed for the overcrowded High School to be expanded.
Superintendent
On April 1, 1933, Evans was appointed School Superintendent of Saugus Public Schools. He filled a vacancy caused the death of Jesse W. Lambert.
In October 1935, Evans expelled six Jehovahs Witness students who refused to salute the flag.
In 1937, the Saugus Public School System became embroiled in a controversy after English teacher and dramatic coach Isabelle Hallin was not reappointed by the school committee amid rumors that she had served cocktails to students during a drama club rehearsal at her home. The three members of the School Committee who voted against keeping Hallin insisted that their actions were based on reports from Evans on her abilities as a teacher and not the unproven rumors. Evans publicly recommend giving her tenure, but the school committee refuse to reinstate her. Evans would testify in Hallin's slander case against Minnie McDuffee that he had investigated the rumors surrounding Hallin and was unable to substantiate them.
In 1938, he traveled to Amherst, New Hampshire and helped convince Saugus High School graduate and college football star Harrington Gates to leave The Holy Ghost and Us Society, a cult led by Frank Sandford, and return to Dartmouth College.
In 1940, he expelled two more Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing to salute the flag.
Evans retired from the Saugus School System on August 31, 1951.
Board of Selectmen
In 1955, Evans was elected to the Saugus Board of Selectmen.
In 1958, the Board selected John B. Kennedy to serve as Town Manager. Evans, who voted for temporary Town Manager Arthur Gustafson instead of Kennedy, chose not to swear him in and Town Clerk Ruth E. Stevens administered the oath instead.
In 1961, the Board voted to ban dancing and other entertainment on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
On February 20, 1962 the Board of Selectmen voted 3 to 2 to appoint John O. Stinson Town Manager with Evans voting for Clarence Wilkinson. Evans would later become a supporter of Stinson and was the only Selectmen who opposed his firing in 1967, although he was unable to attend the meeting due to illness. Evans would vote to appoint temporary manager Stanley Day to permanently succeed Stinson, however Paul H. Boucher was chosen by a 3 to 2 vote. The Board would unanimously vote to fire Boucher six months later and Clarence Wilkinson was appointed to succeed him on a 3 to 2 vote, with Evans once again supporting him.
Personal life
Evans was married to Gladys Wyatt of Prince Edward Island. The couple had one son, Vernon W. Evans, Jr., who would serve as a Florida Circuit Court judge. The two divorced and Evans, Jr. grew up with his mother's family.
On September 16, 1931, Evans married his second wife, Annie M. Emrick, at the Center Congregational Church in Lynn, Massachusetts.

Vertumnus is an oil painting produced by Giuseppe Arcimboldo in 1591 that consists of multiple fruits, vegetables and flowers that come together to create a portrait of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. Although Arcimboldo's colleagues commented that Vertumnus was scherzo, or humorous, there were intentional political meanings behind the piece, particularly regarding the choice of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Arcimboldo's choice to include these items was also an intentional reference to the Roman god, Vertumnus.
Vertumnus was presented to Rudolf II after its completion. Its ownership shifted to the Swedish army after the Thirty Years' War. Although art historians lost track of Vertumnus after this shift, it reappeared in 1845 in Sweden in Skokloster Castle, where it is currently located.
Historical context
Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II
During Rudolf II's twenty-nine year rule in Hungary and Bohemia, art was celebrated and praised. His time as Holy Roman Emperor, now named "Rudolfine Prague", set an unprecedented era for the appreciation of art, with much of this cultivation pushed by Rudolf II himself. This acceptance of art is what allowed Arcimboldo to thrive in his court, especially with the unprecedented, unique style Arcimboldo came to be known for.
The initial impression of Arcimboldo's Vertumnus was that it was joke due to the whimsical nature of the piece. However, Vertumnus was not meant to be presented only as a joke. Rather, the use of fruits and vegetables were meant to display Rudolf II's "metamorphoses of power over the world for a ruler". The imperial patron behind Vertumnus, the specific fruit choices that act as power propaganda, and the copies of Vertumnus that were distributed throughout Europe, "all suggest their role as political allegories".
Rudolf II's portrait itself encapsulated the perfect balance and harmony with nature, arts, and science, all of which Rudolf II believed he represented during his reign. These portraits were an expression of the Renaissance mind's fascination with riddles, puzzles, and the bizarre. The search for unique, fascinating pieces of art was a common trend among Renaissance elites which lent Arcimboldo the perfect opportunity to fascinate viewers with his distinctive style. Although Arcimboldo's traditional religious subjects were later forgotten, his portraits of human heads composed of objects were greatly admired by his contemporaries.
Style
Theme
Giuseppe Arcimboldo was well known for his unique combination of flora, fruits and other various objects in his paintings. Vertumnus has become one of Arcimboldo's most popular paintings that he produced, and this particular art style was encouraged while he was employed in Rudolf II's court. Arcimboldo created a series of works that utilized these still life images such as the Four Seasons, Four Elements, and The Librarian. Ultimately, Arcimboldo would create Vertumnus which drew on much of his experience in the royal court.
Mannerism
During Arcimboldo's time in Rudolf II's court, he was able to refine his unique style that would lead many to later regard Arcimboldo's approach as "typical...of mannerism." Mannerism is a particular art style that lasted from the 1530s to the 1600s. Mannerist artists focused on greatly displaying their technique, their exaggeration of figures, and decorative elements resulting in extremely stylized and hyperbolic pieces. Contemporarily, Arcimboldo is thought of as one of the first pioneers of the Mannerist art style especially due to his unique use of still life images.
Fruits, vegetables & flowers
The portrait of the emperor is created out of plants, flowers and fruits from all seasons: gourds, pears, apples, cherries, grapes, wheat, artichokes, beans, peas, corns, onions, cabbage foils, chestnuts, figs, mulberries, plums, pomegranates, various pumpkins and olives.
Arcimboldo's choice of fruits, vegetables and flowers not only alluded to Emperor Rudolf II's reign, but also referenced his power and wealth. During the Renaissance, collections of oddities and foreign luxury goods were status symbols for the rich. Great families of the Renaissance such as the Medici collected flora, foods, animals (both living and dead) and other materialistic objects to display their wealth and reach (as many people in those days could not afford such luxuries) and thus, goods from the New World began to trickle into the kunstkammer or wunderkammer of many elites. Arcimboldo's use of corn as Emperor Rudolf II's ear (a crop originating from the New World) thus can be seen as a pointedly political decision. By putting in these particular foreign crops, Rudolf II is revealing that he has access to these items showcasing his power and wealth.
Interpretations
The political interpretation of Vertumnus revolves around Rudolf II's rule. In the interpretation, Vertumnus acts as a statement claiming that the known world was claimed under Rudolf II and reveals his intention to defeat the Turks, not for the sake of Christianity but rather for the sake of global power and the everlasting Habsburg dynasty. Politically, Vertumnus has also been interpreted to reveal that Rudolf II's power as the Holy Roman Emperor did not only apply to his subjects and kingdom, but to nature itself (again referencing back to the god Vertumnus). There is also a poetic interpretation that was derived from Arcimboldo's piece. When Arcimboldo compared Rudolf II to Vertumnus, the emperor took on Vertumnus as a representation of himself. While Vertumnus could change his form at will, Rudolf II was known to change his moods at will, too. In Roman mythology, Vertumnus is the god of changing seasons, gardens, fruit trees, and plant growth. These aspects of Vertumnus indicate an "underlying permanence" to the god which in turn reflects back onto Rudolf II's rule. Furthermore, this particular god was present during the birth of Rome which acts as another allusion to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II.
Provenance
Vertumnus was commissioned by Rudolf II during Arcimboldo's employment at his court and was presented to the emperor in 1591. After the Thirty Years' War, the portrait's ownership was seized by the Swedish army. Presently, the exact date of when Vertumnus became part of the Skokloster castle's collection is unknown. It is known that the Swedish Queen Christina was able to obtain Vertumnus. It is rumored that Vertumnus was a gift from the Queen Christina to Karl Gustav Wrangel—proprietor of Skokloster. However, when asked how Vertumnus ended up at Skolkloster Castle or why Vertumnus could not be identified at Skokloster Castle before 1845, Bengt Kylsberg, a curator at Skokloster Castle, stated that, "That mystery remains to be solved!".
In 1988, it was determined that a conservation effort was needed to restore Vertumnus from its poor condition. Arcimboldo's techniques and the medium he used were carefully observed and a preservation technique using krill enzymes (isolated from Antarctic krill) was applied to Vertumnus. Vertumnus now rests in the Skokloster Castle as part of its art collection.

Sylt Airport is the airport on the German island of Sylt located in the municipality of the same name. It mostly features summer seasonal scheduled traffic to major German cities as well as general aviation and gliding. Sometimes the airport is referred to as Westerland/Sylt named after Westerland, a well-known part of the municipality of Sylt which however is not the nearest settlement to the airport.
History
The island of Sylt was a famous destination for leisure and holidays in the early 20th century. Sylt's first small airport was established right after World War I, and in 1919 the first scheduled routes to Weimar, Hamburg and Berlin commenced. As Germany had lost the mainland port serving Sylt due to the Treaty of Versailles, the airport became an important way for travelers to avoid entering Denmark, before the construction of the "Hindenburg causeway" linking Sylt to the mainland by railway.
During World War II the airport was significantly redeveloped and enlarged to serve as a military base. After the war, it became RAF Sylt and was used for weapons and other training until closure in late 1961. In the 1960s the leisure traffic came back and developed strongly from the 1970s onwards.
In 1990 Sylt Airport received new technical equipment as well as new passenger facilities. Today it is capable of handling medium-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737.
In June 2015, Lufthansa CityLine announced the expansion of their services to Sylt: instead of being seasonal, flights from Frankfurt and Munich are now operated year-round. easyJet announced in April 2019 that they would launch weekly flights throughout the summer season to their base in Berlin.
Airlines and destinations
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Sylt Airport:
The nearest larger international airport is Billund Airport in Denmark, approx. (by road) to the north. Hamburg Airport is approx. to the south.

The Khalden training camp (also transliterated Khaldan) was one of the
oldest and best-known military training camps in Afghanistan. It was located in the mountains of eastern Paktia Province, near to Tora Bora.
While some reporters repeat descriptions offered by US intelligence officials that the camp was an al-Qaeda training camp, other reporters note that the camp was set up during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, with the support of the Central Intelligence Agency. Having attended one of these camps has triggered suspicion for many of the detainees in the War on Terror. The Khalden training camp was led by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who was captured in late 2001.
Ahmed Ressam, the Millennium Bomber, said he attended the camp using the alias "Nabil", beginning in April 1998 for five to six months. He said Khalden Camp then generally hosted 50–100 trainees at any time, and he trained there in light weapons, handguns, small machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs), explosives (including TNT, C4 plastic explosives, and black plastic explosives), poisons (including cyanide), poison gas, sabotage, target selection, urban warfare, tactics (including assassinations), and security. Trainees were from Jordan, Algeria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Chechnya, Turkey, Sweden, Germany, and France. During the time he was there, he met Zacarias Moussaoui.
During the early years of the War in Afghanistan, the Bush administration described the Khalden Camp as an al-Qaeda training facility, an assertion used as evidence of an alleged connection to al-Qaeda for Abu Zubaydah and more than 50 other men held as enemy combatants at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Since 2006, however, this allegation has been contested by the 9/11 Commission Report, Brynjar Lia, head of the international terrorism and global jihadism at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment; and unclassified records from the detainees' tribunal reviews (CSRT)s at Guantanamo.
Zubaydah testified in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) that the Khalden Camp was at such odds with al-Qaeda and bin Laden that it was closed by the Taliban in 2000, at bin Laden's request. This account was corroborated by two other detainees, Noor Uthman Muhammed, alleged by the U.S. Government to have been the emir, or leader, of the Khalden Camp; and Khalid Sulayman Jaydh Al Hubayshi, a close friend of Zubaydah. In addition, Muhamed's charge sheet refers to the closing of the Khalden camp at the request of terrorist leaders.
Brynjar Lia wrote in his 2008 book that an ideological conflict, between the leaders of the Khalden Camp and the Taliban and al-Qaeda, led to the closing of the Khalden Camp. Zubaydah, Khalid Sulayman Jaydh Al Hubayshi, and Noor Uthman Muhammed confirmed this divide in their CSRT testimony. Of the 57 detainees the U.S. Government claims are associated with the Khalden Camp, 27 have been released, including Zubaydah's friend Al Hubayshi.
Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı which is the Turkish media arm of the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party wrote a biography they wrote on one of their members, Garib (Asadullah) Turkistani in 1997 who went to Pakistan, was tutored by Abdullah Azzam in religious learning in camp Khalden in order to join the Taliban because he wanted Shariah. He moved to Kabul to enlist in the Mujahideen. He came part of Liwa al Ansar and was injured in a car accident while fleeing the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. He died while fighting against American troops who they called "Crusaders".
The Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party's "Islamic Turkistan" magazine in its 5th edition published an obituary of its member Turghun (Ibn Umar al Turkistani) speaking of his time training at the Al Khaldan training camp and his meeting with Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. The Uyghurs in Afghanistan fought against the American bombing and the Northern Alliance after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Ibn Umar died fighting against Americans at Qala-i-Jangi that month.

Combating BDS Act () is an anti-BDS bill passed by the Senate in the 116th United States Congress intended to counter the BDS movement's call for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.
The bill was introduced in January, 2019 on the first day of the 116th session of Congress in a package of four bills related to the Middle East. Three of the other bills were uncontroversial. Marco Rubio (R-FL) was the primary sponsor of the bill and the co-sponsors were James Risch, (R-ID), Cory Gardner, (R-Co), and Mitch McConnell, (R-KY)
A week after the package was introduced in the Senate, it was blocked by Democrats from moving forward. On February 5, 2020, it was passed in the Senate with the vote 77 to 23, with 22 Democrats and Rand Paul voting nay.
Free speech issues
The bill was criticized by several parties on grounds that economic boycotts are protected by the First Amendment and some critics alleged that the bill was unconstitutional. Among its critics were, Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul (R-KY), Representative Rashida Tlaib, antiwar group Code Pink, J Street, and the American Civil Liberties Union.
Paul gave a speech in the Senate explaining his opposition to the bill:
[B]oycotting or protesting is something so fundamentally American, so fundamentally associated with the First Amendment that even if we don't like what you are boycotting, even if we don't like what you are saying, that in America we allow that to happen because that is what freedom of speech is about…
Boycotting is speech. I went to a Baptist college. I remember when I was in college that the Baptist women of the Southwest Baptist Convention didn't like pornography being out in front at the store where kids could view it. Do you know what they did? They marched. They didn't hurt anybody. They didn't commit violence. They did nonviolent protests by marching in front of the utility stores until–guess what–because of the economic boycott and the bad press, the people put the pornographic magazines behind the counter, and only adults were allowed to buy them and look at them. That is from a boycott.
We boycotted English tea to found a country. ...
Are we here to say that we are going to forbid boycotting, that you can't do business with the government? Here is the problem. People say: Oh, it is a privilege to do business with the government. What if you are a physician and half of your business is with the government? What if you are a nurse? Half of the healthcare in our country is paid for by the government. What if you are a teacher and you work in the public schools? Are we going to ask all of these people to take a litmus test that they are not going to boycott or protest against their government's policy? What kind of country would we live in? Yet it is groupthink around here. Everybody is so paranoid and saying: Oh, we can't object to this lobby. Because this lobby is so powerful, we can't object to them. Look, it isn't about the ideas; it is about the freedom of speech.

The chapters of the manga series 07-Ghost are written and illustrated by Yuki Amemiya and Yukino Ichihara. The series focuses on Teito Klein, a former slave sent to attend the Barsburg Empire's military academy due to his ability to use Zaiphon, a type of supernatural power. The ability is rare, and thus highly prized. Teito is an amnesiac and doesn't remember anything of his origins - what he does learn of his past comes from his recurring and often traumatizing dreams.
07-Ghost was serialized in the monthly magazine Monthly Comic Zero Sum, published by Ichijinsha. Seventeen tankoban volumes have been released. The first volume released on November 25, 2005, and the final on September 25, 2013. The manga was licensed by Go! Comi for release in North America. Viz Media has since picked up the license for the series, after Go!Comi closed, after only releasing the first 3 volumes of 07-Ghost.
Volume list
Note: Only the first three volumes were released in English by Go!Comi before they closed; both the Go!Comi and Viz Media release dates and ISBNs are listed for volumes 1-3. From volume 4 onwards, the only release dates and ISBNs are that of Viz Media.

07 Ghosts
Jack K. Pleis (May 11, 1917 – December 5, 1990) was an American jazz pianist, arranger, conductor, composer and producer. He recorded on London and Decca Records in the 1950s, and Columbia Records in the 1960s. During the course of his career, Pleis worked with many artists, including Louis Armstrong, Harry Belafonte, Bing Crosby, Sammy Davis Jr., Benny Goodman, Earl Grant, Brenda Lee, and Joe Williams. Between 1950 and 1976, over 150 songs were arranged by Pleis. His surname is pronounced "Pleece" (to rhyme with "fleece").
Early life and education
Jack Pleis was born in Philadelphia on May 11, 1917. Starting at age four, he began his training in classical piano. He first performed in concert when he was seven. By the time he was eleven, he appeared on radio programs for children.
Pleis enrolled in college intending to study medicine. To support his studies, he played piano in jazz and popular music bands. Eventually he left school and moved to New York City, where he began his musical career.
Career
Early days
In New York, Pleis became successful as a pianist, arranger, conductor, and composer. He was one of Jan Savitt's Top Hatters, playing piano and doing arrangements, a position he left in 1942 to enlist in the Army during World War II. In 1947, the Jack Pleis Trio provided instrumental support for Larry Laurence (with The Quintones providing vocal harmonies). By 1948, Pleis was working at the RCA Victor studios on 24th Street, appearing on the cover of the January 1, 1949 issue of Billboard playing piano at the studio's holiday party. His orchestra backed Teresa Brewer and Bobby Wayne on their 1949 single "Copper Canyon"/"'Way Back Home". Pleis was also part of the Dixieland All-Stars group which backed Brewer's breakout hit (and signature song) "Music! Music! Music!" in late 1949.
London Records
Pleis joined the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1950. He began work as arranger and composer at London Records under Tutti Camarata. The orchestra backed Ralph Young on his 1950 London single "Please Treat Her Nicer"/"I've Got the World on a String", and Pleis released his own single "Ragging the Scale"/"Story of the Stars", the B-side of which ranked at number 10 on "The Disk Jockeys Pick" in Billboard. In early May 1950, he accompanied his future wife, London recording artist Eve Young, on a promotional tour prior to her opening show. Pleis released several more singles, "Time Alone (Can Heal a Broken Heart)"/"What is There to Say", "I'll Always Be in Love with You"/"Caravan", and "Le Petite Valse"/"Ragamuffin", and the orchestra backed Snooky Lanson on his 1950 London single "You Wonderful You"/"Honestly I Love You".
In June 1950, Pleis married Eve Young, and the March birth of their daughter Michelle was noted in an April 1951 Billboard. The Orchestra backed Eve on her single "Just for Tonight"/"Would I Love You?" In 1952, Pleis and orchestra worked with The Bell Sisters and continued working with Teresa Brewer. Pleis left London Records, and Eve signed a new contract with Coral Records, recording under her new name, Karen Chandler. Her debut for Coral, backed by Pleis' orchestra, was the song "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me," and it became an enormous hit. Selling over a million copies, it peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard charts. In 1953, Pleis and orchestra backed her on her third Coral release, "I'd Love to Fall Asleep (And Wake Up in Your Arms)"/"Goodbye, Charlie, Goodbye".
Decca Records
In mid-1953 Pleis joined Decca Records under Milt Gabler. Pleis and Orchestra released "The Eighteenth Variation"/"Mr. Peepers" under the Decca label. The orchestra backed Karen Chandler again on "Why?"/"Flash From the Blue". 1954 saw the release of the orchestra's Decca singles, "Frenchman in St. Louis"/"Pagan in Paris", "Ah Ri Rung", and "For Always"/"Beyond the Blue Horizon", and the orchestra backed the Dinning Sisters on "Steel Guitar Rag", Eileen Barton on "And Then", and Teresa Brewer on her album A Bouquet of Hits.
1955 saw Pleis scheduled to be profiled in the April issue of The American Magazine. Pleis and His Orchestra began releasing singles of Disney film songs (also collected and released on the album Music from Disneyland), and also released "Lies"/"Hey There" and "Pauline"/"The Trouble With Harry", the title tune for Alfred Hitchcock's film, The Trouble with Harry.
In 1956, Pleis and His Orchestra again backed Karen Chandler, this time on her first Decca release, and Pleis released another album, Strings and Things. The orchestra backed Bobby Darrin on his single "Rock Island Line"/"Timber". In October, Pleiss' song "Giant", theme of the film Giant, debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at #93, peaking at #91 in December, and the song "I'll Always Be In Love With You" charted at #65, also in December. Pleis also produced Bing Crosby's album, Songs I Wish I Had Sung the First Time Around.
1957 saw the release of singles "(But As They Say) That's Life"/"Goodnight Waltz", "Search for Paradise"/"Serenade to Michelle", and "The Carefree Heart"/"Serenade in Soft Shoe", and the Orchestra backed Georgie Shaw on "One More Sunrise", Sammy Davis Jr. on "The Golden Key", and Merv Griffin on "I'll Be Thinking of You". "(But As They Say) That's Life" charted at #69 in June 1957.
In 1958, the Orchestra backed Carmen McRae on her album Mad About the Man, as well as Toni Arden and also backed The Four Aces on their album Swingin Aces. He produced the Kalin Twins song "When", which spent five weeks at No. 1 on the UK charts.
In 1960, Pleis conducted for The Castilians' album, Valentino Tangos. Pleis and Orchestra backed Sammy Davis Jr. on a dozen tracks for Decca, including "What Kind of Fool Am I?" (which won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1963), "The Lady Is a Tramp", "I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues", "Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me", "I Got a Woman", "There Is No Greater Love", "Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You", "This Little Girl of Mine", "Till Then", and "Mess Around".
Columbia Records
The 1960s brought a move to Columbia Records. In 1961, Pleis and Orchestra backed Brazilian singer Maysa Matarazzo on her album Maysa Sings Songs Before Dawn, he conducted for Billy Butterfield's album, The Golden Horn, and arranged several of the tracks on Lionel Hampton's album, Soft Vibes Soaring Strings. Pleis also produced Les Elgart's album, "It's De-Lovely" For Dancing and Listening, and released an EP, Medley from The Musical "Through The Years" and an LP, Stage Left, Stage Right. In 1963, he conducted for Peter Nero's album, Born Free, and Pleis and Orchestra backed Liza Minnelli on her single, "One Summer Love"/"How Much Do I Love You?".
Film and television scores
Pleis and His Orchestra performed the songs "Strange Feelings" and "The Blues I Got Comin' Tomorrow" for the soundtrack of the 1961 film, Force of Impulse. Pleis composed and conducted the music for the 1964 film, Diary of a Bachelor. He also composed music for the television shows Family Affair (1966), Gunsmoke (1967), The Wild Wild West (1967–1969), and Dusty's Trail (1973–1974).
Later career
Pleis arranged the songs on side one of Johnny Hartman's 1967 album, I Love Everybody, including "If I Had You", "I Cover the Waterfront", and "For Once in My Life".
Under the moniker The Sound of Our Times, Pleis co-produced and penned two songs for the 1967 easy listening, psychedelic instrumental LP Music of the Flower Children.
Pleis produced several of Harry Belafonte's albums, Belafonte by Request (1970), The Warm Touch (1971), and Calypso Carnival (1971). Pleis also produced several of Jack Jones' albums, A Jack Jones Christmas (1969), A Time for Us (1970), and Christmas With Jack Jones (1973). He produced Hugo Montenegro's album, Colours Of Love (1970).
In 1976, Pleis put out what would be the last album released under his own name, I Play the Songs the Whole World Sings, on Ranwood Records.
Private life and death
Pleis was married to singer Karen Chandler. He died December 5, 1990 in Palm Springs, California at the age of 73, and is survived by his children Michelle Pleis Stirber, Jason Pleis, and Damon Pleis.

In fluid dynamics, slosh refers to the movement of liquid inside another object (which is, typically, also undergoing motion).
Strictly speaking, the liquid must have a free surface to constitute a slosh dynamics problem, where the dynamics of the liquid can interact with the container to alter the system dynamics significantly. Important examples include propellant slosh in spacecraft tanks and rockets (especially upper stages), and the free surface effect (cargo slosh) in ships and trucks transporting liquids (for example oil and gasoline).
However, it has become common to refer to liquid motion in a completely filled tank, i.e. without a free surface, as "fuel slosh".
Such motion is characterized by "inertial waves" and can be an important effect in spinning spacecraft dynamics. Extensive mathematical and empirical relationships have been derived to describe liquid slosh. These types of analyses are typically undertaken using computational fluid dynamics and finite element methods to solve the fluid-structure interaction problem, especially if the solid container is flexible. Relevant fluid dynamics non-dimensional parameters include the Bond number, the Weber number, and the Reynolds number.
Slosh is an important effect for spacecraft, ships, some land vehicles and some aircraft. Slosh was a factor in the Falcon 1 second test flight anomaly, and has been implicated in various other spacecraft anomalies, including a near-disaster with the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR Shoemaker) satellite.
Spacecraft effects
Liquid slosh in microgravity is relevant to spacecraft, most commonly Earth-orbiting satellites, and must take account of liquid surface tension which can alter the shape (and thus the eigenvalues) of the liquid slug. Typically, a large fraction of the mass of a satellite is liquid propellant at/near Beginning of Life (BOL), and slosh can adversely affect satellite performance in a number of ways. For example, propellant slosh can introduce uncertainty in spacecraft attitude (pointing) which is often called jitter. Similar phenomena can cause pogo oscillation and can result in structural failure of a space vehicle.
Another example is problematic interaction with the spacecraft's Attitude Control System (ACS), especially for spinning satellites which can suffer resonance between slosh and nutation, or adverse changes to the rotational inertia. Because of these types of risk, in the 1960s the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) extensively studied liquid slosh in spacecraft tanks, and in the 1990s NASA undertook the Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment on the Space Shuttle. The European Space Agency has advanced these investigations with the launch of SLOSHSAT. Most spinning spacecraft since 1980 have been tested at the Applied Dynamics Laboratories drop tower using sub-scale models. Extensive contributions have also been made by the Southwest Research Institute, but research is widespread in academia and industry.
Research is continuing into slosh effects on in-space propellant depots. In October 2009, the Air Force and United Launch Alliance (ULA) performed an experimental on-orbit demonstration on a modified Centaur upper stage on the DMSP-18 satellite launch in order to improve "understanding of propellant settling and slosh", "The light weight of DMSP-18 allowed of remaining LO2 and LH2 propellant, 28% of Centaur's capacity", for the on-orbit tests. The post-spacecraft mission extension ran 2.4 hours before the planned deorbit burn was executed.
NASA's Launch Services Program is working on two on-going slosh fluid dynamics experiments with partners: CRYOTE and SPHERES-Slosh. ULA has additional small-scale demonstrations of cryogenic fluid management are planned with project CRYOTE in 2012–2014 leading to a ULA large-scale cryo-sat propellant depot test under the NASA flagship technology demonstrations program in 2015. SPHERES-Slosh with Florida Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology will examine how liquids move around inside containers in microgravity with the SPHERES Testbed on the International Space Station.
Sloshing in road tank vehicles
Liquid sloshing strongly influences the directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles in a highly adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils, stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.
The Bloodhound LSR 1,000 mph project cars utilizes a liquid-fuelled rocket that requires a specially-baffled oxidizer tank to prevent directional instability, rocket thrust variations and even oxidizer tank damage.
Practical effects
Sloshing or shifting cargo, water ballast, or other liquid (e.g., from leaks or fire fighting) can cause disastrous capsizing in ships due to free surface effect; this can also affect trucks and aircraft.
The effect of slosh is used to limit the bounce of a roller hockey ball. Water slosh can significantly reduce the rebound height of a ball but some amounts of liquid seem to lead to a resonance effect. Many of the balls for roller hockey commonly available contain water to reduce the bounce height.

Containerlift is a freight transport company in the United Kingdom. Containerlift introduced the sidelifter transport concept widely used in Australia and New Zealand to the UK.
The company has since expanded into general container movement, using sidelifters, conventional road transport, rail transport and logistics and consultancy. It has expanded abroad to sites in France, The Netherlands and Ireland.
In September 2005 Containerlift introduced a pioneering new service transporting containers between the deep water port of Thamesport and destinations in London, using an intermediate scheduled rail service to Willesden with partner English Welsh & Scottish. This service is unusual in the fact that modern rail based container transport has been traditionally done over much longer distances, marking a shift in the economies involved, when considering traffic congestion, fuel prices and driver shortages.

The Mercedes-Benz L3000 was a 4x2 3-tonne rear axle drive truck used by Germany in World War II, powered by a Daimler-Benz OM 65/4 74 hp 4-cylinder diesel engine. It was used alongside the Opel Blitz, and proved even more reliable in rough terrain; and was used in all fronts and extensively by the Afrika Korps. It was manufactured in three versions, the L3000, the L3000A, and the L3000S, from 1938 to 1944. When production was discontinued, more than 27,700 L3000 type trucks had been built, making it the most produced Mercedes-Benz truck of World War II.
History
From 1896, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft built not only passenger cars, but also light and heavy trucks with a payload of up to 10 t for the civilian and military sectors. The Reichswehr also used 3-ton trucks as a personnel carrier. Daimler-Benz in 1934 produced some off-road test vehicles under the name Mercedes-Benz LG 63, which went on to successful testing as a Mercedes-Benz LG 3000 in mass production and were delivered from 1936 to the Wehrmacht, Reichspost, Reichsbahn and business operations.
The L3000 was used in all major theaters of World War II where German forces were deployed, and was also used by civilian fire departments.

Alcolu is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Clarendon County, South Carolina, United States. As of the 2010 census, its population was 429. Alcolu has a post office with ZIP code 29001, which opened on August 17, 1888. It developed as a lumber and mill town.
History
Alcolu was established between 1885 and 1890 by D.W. Alderman as a company mill town; it was developed to house the employees of his timber company and lumber mill. These were located in a relatively isolated area. The name Alcolu is derived from "AL" for Alderman, "CO" for Coldwell (a friend), and "LU" for Lula, then the only daughter of D.W. Alderman and his wife.
When it was built, Alcolu was a company town where everybody worked in one of the various businesses of D.W. Alderman & Sons. The business grew to encompass logging operations, a saw mill, planing mill, hosiery mill, flooring mill, and extensive farming and cattle ranching. They also ran a cotton gin, hotel, company store, and several other businesses. Over time, the company helped found schools and churches, and built baseball fields, an electric plant, and a telephone system for the town. D.W. Alderman also founded the Alcolu and the Paroda railroads, and built the Alcolu railroad depot. The Alcolu Post Office was established on August 17, 1888. His friend Algernon Coldwell was appointed as its first Postmaster.
Company employees were paid in "babbits", a metal coin stamped with an "A", which could be used only in the company store. There they could buy groceries, see the doctor, get a haircut, or watch a show in the 200-seat auditorium upstairs. In 1919, the company opened the "Alderman 20 Stores in One" in nearby Manning, South Carolina. It was one of the first department stores in South Carolina and boasted of having the first elevator in town.
The site came to its attention to the scene on March 22nd 1944, when two girls Betty June Binnicker, aged 11, and Mary Thames, aged 7, were found dead after being murdered. Notably, 14-year-old George Stinney was wrongly found guilty of their murder and became the youngest person to be executed in the United States since 12-year old Hannah Ocuish in 1786. The decision was vacated in 2014.
In 1947, the Alderman family sold the lumber mill to the Southern Coatings & Chemical Company and the Williams Furniture Company. They, in turn, were bought more than two decades later in 1968 by the Georgia-Pacific company. Georgia-Pacific continued its operations in Alcolu until 2000, when the mill was finally closed. According to the 2010 census, the unincorporated town of Alcolu had a population of 429 people.
Geography
Alcolu is located in northern Clarendon County, north of Manning, the county seat. The southern edge of the CDP follows Interstate 95, which provides access at Exit 122. I-95 leads northeast to Florence and southwest to Santee. U.S. Route 521 runs through Alcolu, leading south to Manning and northwest to Sumter.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Alcolu CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.47%, is water.
Notable people
George Stinney, an African-American teenager, was convicted at age 14 by an all-white jury of murdering two young white girls in March 1944 and executed in June 1944. He was the youngest person to be executed in the U.S. during the 20th century. His conviction was vacated by an appeals court in 2014 because he did not receive a fair trial.

Frederik Christian von Haven (26 June 1728 – 25 May 1763) was a Danish philologist and theologian who took part in the Danish expedition to Yemen.
Biography
Background and early life
Frederik von Haven was born on 26 June 1728 in the rectory of Vester Skerninge on the Danish island of Funen, where his father Lambert von Haven was a priest, and christened on 3 July in the Church of Our Lady in Odense. His mother was Maren, née Wielandt. He had three sisters; he was especially close to Pernille Elisabeth von Haven, who never married.
The von Haven family probably came from North Germany. They were in Bergen in Norway in the 17th century, and later moved to Denmark. The earliest Danish-born von Havens were painters or architects, for example Lambert van Haven (1630–1695), who designed the Thott Mansion, the dome hall of Charlottenborg Palace and all but the tower of the Church of Our Saviour in Copenhagen. Towards the end of the 17th century, von Haven sons started to become priests.
Frederik von Haven's father died in 1738, leaving his family in financial difficulty. With the assistance of relatives, Frederik was able to study at the Cathedral School in Odense and then become a student in theology at the University of Copenhagen. He earned his Master's degree in 1750 and received a scholarship which enabled him to travel to Göttingen for further study, amongst other subjects in Asian languages under the famous professor Johann David Michaelis.
Expedition to Arabia
The expedition to Arabia was Michaelis' idea; he was studying the Bible from comparative historical and linguistic perspectives, so determining details of life in the Middle East was important to his work. He considered that Yemen, being isolated, had preserved many traditions and social patterns from the biblical period. He wrote to King Frederick V to obtain his support for the venture, and the king agreed.
Originally Michaelis had planned to send missionaries from the Danish colony at Tranquebar, but decided instead to send trained scholars. Von Haven was chosen among other reasons because he had shown himself to be an accomplished linguist. When von Haven heard that Maronite monks from Syria were teaching at a college in Rome, he obtained a scholarship to go there and learn Arabic from them. There were also many Middle Eastern manuscripts in the Vatican Library, some of which would be useful. He left at the end of 1759 and remained abroad for about a year. In his absence, the other members of the expedition were appointed by Michaelis and the foreign minister, J. H. E. Bernstorff: the botanist Peter Forsskål, a pupil of Linnaeus, the mathematician and astronomer Carsten Niebuhr, the engraver and miniaturist Georg Wilhelm Baurenfeind, and the physician Christian Carl Kramer.
When von Haven returned to Copenhagen, he was appointed to a professorship, as was Forsskål. On 4 January 1761, the members of the expedition boarded the warship Grønland, which was to take them to Constantinople. However, bad weather forced the ship to return to Helsingør several times. Von Haven and a large part of the crew fell ill, because the drinking water had quickly become polluted. On 11 February, the ship was forced once more to return to Helsingør, and von Haven decided to travel overland to Marseilles and join the expedition there. His journal of the expedition shows that he prepared thoroughly. For example, he watched Professor Kratzenstein in Copenhagen make plaster casts of inscriptions and demonstrate how he cut off a block of inscribed marble. In addition, he bought books and wrote to people who were considered authorities on Arab history, culture and language.
He arrived in Marseilles on 8 May and rejoined the other expedition members on the Grønland when it arrived on 13 May. He had enjoyed himself in the city, going to theatrical performances and concerts and visiting prominent people, and writes in his expedition journal that he "wished they had stayed away for another 14 days".
On 3 June, the ship set sail from Marseilles for Constantinople. On the way there, von Haven and Forsskål had a major disagreement which affected the entire expedition. In his journal, von Haven describes it as a minor discussion arising from Forsskål's dissatisfaction with Kramer's scholarly capabilities, which he won; he writes that Forsskål left the cabin, unable to respond. In Constantinople von Haven bought a few packets of arsenic, causing his colleagues to be afraid he intended to poison them; they wrote to Bernstorff and the Danish consul in Constantinople, von Gähler, to have him removed from the expedition. The effort was in vain, and in his journal von Haven does not devote a single word to the episode.
On 26 September, the expedition arrived in Alexandria in Egypt. There and in Cairo, von Haven made the vast majority of the manuscript purchases which formed part of his professional duties on the voyage. They stayed in Egypt for one year, and between 6 and 25 September 1762, von Haven and Carsten Niebuhr went on a trip to Sinai, where they were to inspect some inscriptions and visit Saint Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai, which was reputed to have a large library of rare manuscripts. However, they were led astray by their Arab guides and were not able to see the inscriptions on the mountain; and the monks would not let them into the monastery because they did not have a letter from the Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church. Von Haven sent a report of this failure to Bernstorff, who had sent word from Copenhagen asking about their progress. Bernstorff was dissatisfied with the response and wrote back that he expected better results, but since the post between Denmark and Egypt was slow, his letter did not arrive until long after von Haven's death.
Death
The expedition then continued on an Arab ship through the Red Sea and on 29 December arrived at the port of Loheia in Yemen. From there they traveled overland to the city of Mocha, stopping on the way in the desert city of Bayt al-Faqih. At this point most of them were sick. It was later established that they had malaria, but they believed it to be only a common cold. The sickness became worse. When they reached Mocha, von Haven was so unwell that he had to stay in bed in their rented house. Von Haven himself realised how serious his sickness was. On the afternoon of 25 May, with an unsteady hand, he wrote the last entry in his travel journal: "25 May 1763, morning: after midday God gave me, I believe, a blessed ending. I was born on 26 June 1728." He was buried in the Christian cemetery in Mocha, which still exists. The location of the grave is not known.
Scholarly results
Von Haven bought 116 manuscripts, which were given to the Royal Danish Library, where they still are. They include historical, geographical and linguistic texts, and in addition poetry in Arabic and Hebrew. There are seven Hebrew Bibles. Amongst others, the Oxford theologian Benjamin Kennicott used them in preparing his authoritative critical edition of the Old Testament. Many of the manuscripts are beautifully illustrated.
The journal shows that von Haven possessed good scholarly judgement and observational skills. For the last half year of his life, there are only notes. His field of study, philology, required much revision, so his findings in that area are difficult to assess today. The edited part of his journal is one of the best works of Danish prose of that stylistically not yet well developed period, on a par with Frederik Sneedorff's travel letters and Andreas Christian Hviid's travel diaries.
Thorkild Hansen's Det lykkelige Arabien
The Arabian expedition is today mostly known through the writer Thorkild Hansen's 1962 documentary novel Det lykkelige Arabien (literally, Arabia Felix). In Hansen's book, Frederik von Haven is selfish, cowardly and lazy. He constantly tried to undermine the scholarly work which Forsskål and Niebuhr in particular are endeavouring to do. This stems from Hansen's interpretation of the sources; his main sources were two biographies of Forsskål, Carl Christensen's Naturforskeren Pehr Forsskål (1918) and Henrik Schück's Från Linnés tid. Peter Forsskål (1923). These are both very critical of von Haven. In addition he used the biography of Niebuhr by his son Barthold Georg Niebuhr.
Hansen presumably did not know about von Haven's travel journal, which existed as a manuscript in the Royal Danish Library (and was first printed in 2005). The only writings by von Haven himself used by Hansen were the report of the failed trip to Sinai and letters to friends and acquaintances. These letters are concerned only with personal matters and not with the work of the expedition, which has greatly impacted Hansen's picture of von Haven: he appears in the book as someone who thought only about comfort and good food, and complained constantly about bad health. That von Haven was headstrong and had an aversion to Forsskål—and was in general unsuited to an expedition of this kind—is not a view that his journal does much to dispel. However, it does show that he did his best with respect to the scholarly task, and that the accusations of laziness and poor excuses must be reevaluated. His problem was, as Hansen states in his novel, that the expedition spent most of its time at sea or in barren wastes and that there was little for a philologist to do in such places, while there was much for a cartographer and a botanist to do.
For literary reasons Hansen demonised von Haven: his negative aspects were to contrast with the heroes Niebuhr and Forsskål. Von Haven therefore plays the rôle in the book of "the indispensable bad guy".

James Malloy (May 23, 1932 – May 18, 1972), was an American racecar driver.
Born in Columbus, Nebraska, Malloy's family moved to Englewood, Colorado, where he attended grade school and high school. Malloy lettered in football and baseball in high school. He attended Colorado State University for two years.
Early Racing Years
In 1955 Malloy started driving Semi-Modifieds at Lakeside Speedway in Denver, Colorado. He continued racing at Lakeside through 1962. This is where he branched out and ran with the fledgling Canadian American Modified Racing Association (CAMRA), an organization that raced mainly in the Northwest United States and in British Columbia. The CAMRA series became a series where a driver could develop their skills and move up to Indy Car racing and running the Indianapolis 500. Billy Foster, Art Pollard, Dick Simon and later Indy 500 winner Tom Sneva, his brother Jerry Sneva, Eldon Rasmussen and Cliff Hucul raced in the Indy 500 after graduating from the CAMRA series. Malloy was no exception. He drove a modified built and prepared by his brother Jerry Malloy and in 1964 & 1965 he won the CAMRA championship.
Indy car racing
In 1967 he started driving USAC sprint cars. This is when Malloy got a huge break in his racing career. He was hired by the Jim Robbins Race Team to drive USAC Indy Cars. He ran eight races for the Robbins team that year with his best finish being a 6th at Langhorne, Pennsylvania. The Robbins team brought Malloy to Indianapolis in 1968 where he was the fastest rookie qualifier. He started 14th and finished 22nd, dropping out after 64 laps with mechanical failure. In 1969 Malloy started 13th and despite an early 22 minute pit stop he managed an 11th-place finish. In 1970 he qualified 9th, his best starting position to date. Unfortunately his car broke a rear constant velocity joint and hit the 4th turn wall at the end of the pace lap, putting himself out of the race even before the start. In 1971 was originally entered in a car for the M.V.S. Racing Team. But when LeeRoy Yarbrough crashed hard with one of Dan Gurney's Eagles, his injuries were severe enough that he could not compete in the Indy 500 in 1971. Dan Gurney asked Malloy to pilot the Eagle in place of Yarbrough. He drove a solid race finishing 4th, his personal best at Indianapolis.
Malloy drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1967-1972 seasons, with 61 career starts, including the 1968-1971 Indianapolis 500 races. In his Champ Car career, he finished in the top ten 23 times, with his best finish in 2nd position in 1969 at the Milwaukee Mile, driving for Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing in a substitute role for the injured Al Unser.
Death
In 1972 Malloy signed on to drive for the Gerhardt racing team and one of the very fast 1972 Eagles. During the month of May Malloy and the new Eagle was among the fastest cars. During the practice session on May 14, he was attempting to break the speed barrier (which other Indy drivers were trying to do at the time) when his car mysteriously cut sharply to the right and crashed head-on into the outside retaining wall confining Turn 3 at about . Malloy died in the hospital, four days after being pulled from his destroyed car. He never regained consciousness. His injuries included head injuries, second degree burns to his face, feet, and hands, and fractures to his right arm and both of his legs and hips. Malloy died only five days before what would have been his 40th birthday.
Other Racing
Malloy attempted to race in the 1966 Daytona 500 but only managed a 21st-place finish in his qualifying race and failed to make the field.
Malloy also drove a 1958 Edsel Pacer at Colorado National Speedway in 1968.
In 1979 Malloy was inducted into the Colorado Motorsports Hall of Fame.
Personal life
Malloy had a wife named Mary. Together they had two sons, Jim and Pat, and a daughter, Cheryl.

Andromeda XIX is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), a member of the Local Group, like the Milky Way Galaxy. Andromeda XIX is considered "the most extended dwarf galaxy known in the Local Group", and has been shown to have a half-light radius of 1.7 kiloparsec (kpc). It was discovered by the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, and is thought to be a dwarf galaxy.
History
Surveillance performed during use of the MegaPrime/MegaCam 1 deg2 (camera) on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) had mapped the Andromeda Galaxy's stellar halo (one quarter) up to ~150 kpc. The survey, which had confirmed the clumpiness of Andromeda's stellar halo, had shown the existence of multiple other dwarf galaxies. They include: Andromeda XI, XII, XIII, XV, XVI, XVIII, XIX, and XX.

One Redcliff Street, Bristol, England, formerly known as the Robinson Building, was built in 1964 as the headquarters of paper and packaging manufacturer E. S. & A. Robinson. Robinsons had occupied the site since 1846. At the time of construction it was the first high rise building in Bristol to "break an unofficial height limit" of . The Robinson building caused "controversy, both locally and nationally, and was seen by many as failing to respond to its environment, in particular its physical relationship to the adjacent Church of St Thomas". However, prominent architect Basil Spence described it as "a gift to the City". It was considered for the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest in 2007, but the application was refused. Law firm TLT LLP occupies the 7th, 8th and 10th-13th floors of the building and Patent & trademark Specialists Withers & Rogers LLP occupies the 9th and part of the 5th with the rest of the floor being vacant.
The names of the building and the street are often misspelt "Redcliffe", from confusion with the nearby Redcliffe district.
In 2016 an extra floor was added raising the roof height from 60 to 64 metres.

Thomas James Schuyler (born June 10, 1952, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) is an American songwriter. Schuyler wrote songs recorded by more than 200 various artists including "16th Avenue" for Lacy J. Dalton, "Love Will Turn You Around" for Kenny Rogers, and "A Long Line of Love" for Michael Martin Murphey.
In 1983, Schuyler signed to Capitol Records and released the album Brave Heart. Its title track was a No. 43 single on the Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) charts. Later, he founded the trio S-K-O (originally known as Schuyler, Knobloch & Overstreet) with J. Fred Knobloch and Paul Overstreet. S-K-O charted seven singles in the mid-1980s, including the Number One hit "Baby's Got a New Baby". Overstreet later assumed a solo career and the trio was renamed S-K-B when Craig Bickhardt replaced him.
After S-K-B disbanded, Schuyler continued to write songs, and was eventually made chairman of the Country Music Association. He also headed RCA Records' Nashville division from 1992 to 1995. In that role he signed singer Kenny Chesney, the band Lonestar and also had a significant role in launching the career of Martina McBride and Sara Evans. Schuyler continued to write songs for Almo-Irving Music, administered several music catalogs and recorded a few independent albums. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2011.
Schuyler is currently the Young Adult Minister at a church in Nashville and an adjunct instructor at Belmont University.

General information for those unfamiliar
The Rugby League BBC2 Floodlit Trophy was a knock-out competition sponsored by the BBC and between rugby league clubs, entrance to which was conditional upon the club having floodlights. Most matches were played on an evening, and those of which the second half was televised, were played on a Tuesday evening.
Despite the competition being named as 'Floodlit', many matches took place during the afternoons and not under floodlights, and several of the entrants, including Barrow and Bramley did not have adequate lighting. And, when in 1973, due to the world oil crisis, the government restricted the use of floodlights in sport, all the matches, including the Trophy final, had to be played in the afternoon rather than at night.
The Rugby League season always (until the onset of "Summer Rugby" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final taking place in December (The only exception to this was when disruption of the fixture list was caused by inclement weather)

Eastern Montana is a loosely defined region of Montana. Some definitions are more or less inclusive than others, ranging from the most inclusive, which would include the entire part of the state east of the Continental Divide, to the least inclusive, which places the beginning of "eastern" Montana roughly at or even east of Billings, Montana. The areas of Montana lying just east of the Continental Divide are often called Central Montana. A widely accepted definition of Eastern Montana is that it encompasses the eastern third of the state.
Parts of Eastern Montana are affected by the economic boom in the Bakken formation, the largest oil discovery in U.S. history.
History
The plains of eastern Montana were historically populated by Plains Indian tribes such as the Sioux, Blackfeet and Crow.
By the late 19th century, people of European descent set up homesteads in the region, and the Native Americans were mostly confined to Indian reservations as they were throughout Montana and the west. To this day, Eastern Montana has a proud Native American population.
Eastern Montana was the location of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
Fort Peck Dam near Glasgow, Montana was a major project of the Public Works Administration, part of the New Deal. Construction of Fort Peck Dam started in 1933, and at its peak in July 1936 employed 10,546 workers. The dam, named for a 19th-century trading post, was completed in 1940, and began generating electricity in July 1943.
Geography, Biomes and Climate
Eastern Montana has a semi-arid steppe climate with low precipitation that is to some extent countered by low evaporation rates. Typical precipitation is mostly in the form of summer thunderstorms and snow, which can fall at any time of the year. Summers are short but hot and winters are long, cold and extremely variable. During some winters, such as 1925–26, 1930–31, 1960–61 and 1991–92, chinook winds descending from the Rockies cause frequent mild spells of lasting up to several weeks. In contrast, other winters such as 1916–17, 1935–36, 1968–69 and 1978–79 see the westerly flow move further south and in this absence of chinooks, temperatures can stay below for weeks at a time.
Though the prairie landscape of eastern Montana has traditionally been considered a part of the Great Plains, a recent (early 2010s) study has shown that, at least in some ways, the biomes of Eastern Montana have more in common and share more species with the Intermountain West scrub steppes and the Palouse of Eastern Washington than they have with the neighboring plains of The Dakotas. Some parts of eastern Montana, in areas most prone to drying chinooks, have near-desert conditions and scrub rather than grassland. Eastern Montana also has breaks and highlands that are widely forested, such as the Custer National Forest and areas around Fort Peck Lake, in contrast to the almost completely treeless plains of the Midwest.
Culture
Eastern Montana was mostly colonized by German and Scandinavian, especially Norwegian, immigrants.

"China Heroically Stands in the Universe" was the national anthem of China from 1915 to 1921.
History
It was issued by the Ritual Regulations Office () in June 1915 as the national anthem of the Republic of China and was adopted on 23 May 1915. Its lyrics were written by Yin Chang () and music by Wang Lu ().
After Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor of China in December 1915, the lyrics of the anthem were slightly modified and turned into the national anthem of the Empire of China. The lyrics were abolished again in 1916 after his death and replaced by lyrics written by Zhang Zuolin. The song was no longer the official anthem after 31 March 1921, when Song to the Auspicious Cloud again became the national anthem.

The native flora of Chile is characterized by a higher degree of endemism and relatively fewer species compared to the flora of other countries of South America. A classification of this flora necessitates its division into at least three general zones: the desert provinces
of the north, Central Chile, and the humid regions of the south.
Northern Chile
The first is an arid desert(Atacama desert) absolutely barren along part of the coast,
between Arica and Copiapó, but with a coarse scanty vegetation
near the Cordilleras along watercourses and on the slopes where
moisture from the melting snows above percolates through the sand.
The altiplano of the northernmost portion of the Chilean territory is home to the Browningia candelaris, a candelabrum-shaped cactus. Another cactus species, the Echinopsis atacamensis, grows in the pre-Andean area. The high Andean region is also characterized by the presence of species of the genus Polylepis and the Azorella compacta. Cacti occur in the coastal desert. Here, the most common species are those of the genus Copiapoa, which are recognizable by their distinctive shapes.
An endemic tree of the Norte Grande is the Prosopis tamarugo. It grows mainly in the Pampa del Tamarugal. South of Loa River and west of Cordillera Domeyko, the Atacama Desert is completely destitute of vegetation.
In the valleys of the Copiapó and Huasco rivers a meagre vegetation is to be found near their channels, apart from what is produced by irrigation, but the surface of the plateau and the dry. River channels below the sierras are completely barren. Continuing southward into the Coquimbo Region a gradual change in the arid conditions may be observed. The higher summits of the Andes afford a larger and more continuous supply of water, and so dependent are the people in the cultivated river valleys on this source of water supply that they watch for snowstorms in the Cordilleras as an indication of what the coming season is to be. The arborescent growth near the mountains is larger and more vigorous, in which are to be found the "algarrobo" (Prosopis chilensis) and "chañar" (Geoffroea decorticans), but the only shrub to be found on the coast is a species of Skytanthus.
Proceeding southward cacti become common, first a dwarfed species, and then a larger columnar form (Echinopsis chiloensis). The streams are fringed with willows; fruit trees and alfalfa fields fill the irrigated valleys, and the lower mountain slopes are better covered with a thorny arborescent growth. The divides between the streams, however, continue barren as far south as the transverse ranges of mountains across the province of Aconcagua.
Central Chile
To some degree the flora of central Chile is of a transition character between the northern and southern zones. It is much more than this, however, for it has a large number of genera and species peculiarly its own. This zone, with the Chilean Matorral, extends from about the 30th to the 36th parallel, perhaps a little farther south to include some characteristic types. The evergreens largely predominate here as well as in the extreme south, and on the open, sunburnt plains the vegetation takes on a sub-tropical aspect.
One of the most characteristic trees of this zone is the peumo (Cryptocarya alba), whose dense evergreen foliage is everywhere conspicuous. The quillay (Quillaja saponaria) is another characteristic evergreen tree of this region, whose bark possesses saponaceous properties. In earlier times the coquito palm (Jubaea chilensis) was to be found throughout this part of Chile, but it is almost completely extinct due to the destructive extraction process of its sweet sap, from which a syrup is made. Through the central zone the plains are open and there are forests on the mountain slopes.
Southern Chile
One of the most striking forest trees is the pehuén or Chilean pine (Araucaria araucana), which often grows to a height of 100 ft. and is prized by the natives for its fruit. Three native species of the genus Nothofagus: the roble (Nothofagus obliqua), coihue (Nothofagus dombeyi), and raulí (Nothofagus alpina)--are widely diffused and highly prized for their wood, especially the first, which is misleadingly called roble (oak).
Chile's thickest forest are found between the Bío-Bío River and the Taitao Peninsula. Among those trees are the alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides), the ciprés de las Guaitecas (Pilgerodendron uviferum), the Chilean cypress (Austrocedrus chilensis), lingue (Persea lingue), laurel (Laurelia sempervirens), avellano (Gevuina avellana), luma (Luma apiculata), and many others.
In the southern zone there are no plains, with the exception of small areas near the Strait of Magellan, and the forests are universal. In the variety, size and density of their growth these forests remind one of the tropics. They are made up, in great part, of the evergreen beech (Nothofagus betuloides), the deciduous antarctic beech (Nothofagus antarctica) and Winter's bark (Drimys winteri), intermingled with a dense undergrowth composed of a great variety of shrubs and plants, among which are Maytenus magellanica, Gaultheria mucronata, Berberis buxifolia, wild currant (Ribes magellanicum), a trailing blackberry, tree ferns, reed-like grasses and innumerable parasites (including species of the genus Misodendron). On the eastern side of the Cordillera, in the extreme south, the climate is drier and open, and grassy plains are found, but on the western side the dripping forests extend from an altitude of 1000 to 1500 ft. down to the level of the sea. A peculiar vegetable product of this inclement region
is a small globular fungus growing on the bark of the beech, which is a staple article of food among the Fuegians—probably the only instance where a fungus is the bread of a people.

Barzabod was a high-ranking Iranian official in 5th-century Sasanian Iran. A Mihranid prince of the Gardman region, he served as the viceroy of Caucasian Albania.
According to the Georgian chronicler Juansher, Barzabod married off her daughter Sagdukht to his Iberian neighbor, Mihrdat V, then heir apparent to King Archil of Iberia, and eventually king in his own right. The marriage helped to seal peace between the once hostile neighbors. After Archil's death c. 435, Sagdukht relied on her father for support during her regency for her underage son, Vakhtang I of Iberia.
Barzabod died around 440, and was succeeded by his son Varaz-Bakur.

Mysore region
Kunitha: a ritual dance
The ritual dances of Karnataka are known as Kunitha. One such dance is the Dollu Kunitha, a popular dance form accompanied by singing and the beats of decorated drums. This dance is primarily performed by men from the shepherd or Kuruba caste. The Dollu Kunitha is characterized by vigorous drum beats, quick movements and synchronized group formations.
Bharatnatyam / Bharata Natya
Bharatanatyam is classical dance of Karnataka too. It is referred as Bharata Natya in Kannada. This Indian classical dance form was mentioned in the Kannada text Manasollasa written by Someshwara lll.
Dollu Kunitha
This is a group dance named after the dollu used in its performance, and performed by the men of the Kuruba community. The group consists of 16 dancers, each wearing a drum and playing different rhythms while dancing. The beat is directed by a leader with cymbals in the center. Slow and fast rhythms alternate, and the group weaves a varied pattern. Costumes are simple; the upper part of the body is usually left bare, while a black sheet is tied on the lower body over the dhoti. A troupe led by K. S. Haridas Bhat toured the USSR in 1987, performing in Moscow, Leningrad, Vyborg, Archangelsk, Pskov, Murmansk, Tashkent and Novograd.
Beesu kamsale and kamsale nritya
This is a group dance performed by village men in the Mysore, Nanjanagudu, Kollegala and Bangalore regions. It is named after the kamsale, which is played and as a prop by the dancers. The kamsale is a cymbal in one hand and a bronze disc in the other, producing a rhythmic clang.
The kamsale nritya is connected to a tradition of worship of Male Mahadeshwara (Shiva) by the Kuruba community, from which most of the dancers are drawn. The dance is performed to rhythmic, melodious music sung in praise of Shiva. It is part of a diiksha(oath), and is taught by a spiritual leader. This dance was showcased in Kannada films such as Janumadha Jodi and Jogi, in which the protagonist is a kamsale dancer.
Somana Kunita
Somana Kunita (the Mask Dance) is a celebratory form of guardian spirit worship popular in southern Karnataka, performed primarily in village shrines dedicated to the Mother Goddess by the Gangemata community. The dance is characterised by elaborate masks (somas) painted in a variety of colours, with each mask's colour indicating the god's nature. A benevolent deity is represented by a red mask, while a yellow or black mask suggests the opposite. There are many types of masks, differing from region to region.
Somana Kunitha is a ritualistic dance associated with worship of the Grama Devate [village deity], and is primarily celebrated after Ugadi and before the onset of the monsoon at Maha Shivaratri. It is most popular in the old Mysore region, in districts such as Hassan, Tumkur, Bangalore, Mandya and Chitradurga.
On the ceremonial day, offerings are made to the spirits. The masks are made from the red sandalwood tree. Other props include a cane (or stick) and peacock feathers. A small hat with colourful flowers, neem leaves and colourful strips of cloth is also worn. Music is provided by the doonu(percussion), mouri(pipe) and sadde(a pipe for the Śruti). The dancer begins in the temple of the goddess, singing praise of the guardian spirit in a trance-like state. An offering of the blood of a fowl is sometimes made to the goddess.
Suggi Kunita
Suggi Kunita (the Harvest Dance) is performed during the harvest time mostly by the farming community. Artists in beautiful costumes and wooden headgear adorned with carved birds and flowers dance to the tune of drums with sticks and peacock feathers. They enhance the dance sometimes, by their own signing.
North Karnataka
Jaggahalige Kunita
This is a folk art of the Hubballi Dharwad region (particularly the village of Byahatti), which is performed on occasions such as Ugadi and Holi. The jagghalige is a percussion instrument made from a bullock cart wheel wrapped in buffalo hide. The villagers roll out the large instruments and march in procession. The performance is directed by a choreographer playing a much-smaller percussion instrument called the kanihaligi, made of clay and covered with calf hide. The performance usually involves about 15 people.
Karadi majalu
This is popular group folk music in north Karnataka, performed during occasions and in processions. The karadi or karade is the percussion instrument used by the group. It is a palm-sized cymbal producing metallic sounds, and the shehnai produces the melody.
Krishna Parijatha
Krishna Parijatha is theatre popular in North Karnataka. It is a combination of Yakshagana and Bayalata, portraying stories or scenes from the Mahabharata
Lavani
This folk dance of Maharashtra is also present in some parts karnataka
Dakshina Kannada
Bhootha Aradhane
This dance form is widely performed in coastal regions. The Bhootha Aradhane (Gana) worship includes a procession of idols and is characterized by drums and firecrackers. At the end of the procession, the idols are placed on a plinth. A dancer, personifying a bhoota (holy spirit), dances around the plinth with sword and jingling bells. The dancer dances quickly and then slows, signifying that he is now divine.
Yakshagana
Yakshagana is not folk art but a popular traditional theatre of India performed in coastal and malenadu regions which is a blend of dance, music, songs, scholarly dialogue and colourful costumes. The word means "celestial music", and the dance drama is performed during the night (usually after the winter crop has been harvested).
Kodagu
The Huttari Dance and 'Contemporary theatre culture in Karnataka is one of the most vibrant in India with organizations like Ninasam, Ranga Shankara and Rangayana active
on foundations laid down by the Gubbi Veeranna Nataka Company
Bolak-aata are dance forms in Kodagu. The Kodavas are a unique group who differ in customs, traditions and religion from the surrounding populace, and have an annual harvest dance. The men, dressed in traditional Kodava costumes with decorative knives, perform this slow dance to background music. The dance has different varieties:
Bolak-aat
Performed by Kodava men in back of an oil lamp in an open field. The men hold chavari(yak fur) in one hand and the Kodava short sword (odi-kathi) in the other while performing this dance. Regional varieties of this dance exist in which performers dance with the chavari and not the short sword. When the odi-kathi is also used, the dance is known as kattiyaata. The dudi, an hourglass-shaped drum, provides the rhythm.
Ummatt-aat
Performed by Kodava women, who wear traditional Kodava dress with jewelry, adorn their foreheads with kumkuma and dance in a circle to a swinging rhythm, brass cymbals in hand. A woman stands at the center holding a pot full of water to represent Kaveri Taayi (Mother Kaveri), whom the Kodavas worship.
Komb-aat
While the Bolaak-aat and the Ummatt-aat are celebratory and festive, the Komb-aat is a religious dance. It is traditionally performed in temples, but may also be performed in other places. Performed by Kodava men, deer horns represent the horns of the krishnamruga (a spotted deer in Kodava legend). The dance is performed to rhythmic tunes played on wind instruments and percussion, and includes martial movements representing techniques used by the Kodavas in warfare.
Arts common to most regions
Hagalu veshagaararu
This is a group of itinerant actors in Karnataka who specialise in unscripted miming; no stage or facility is used. The artists move from place to place, pitching tents and offering to perform. They play a variety of mythological, legendary and real characters. Performances draw from daily life, and sometimes full-length plays are staged. They perform vachana sahityas by Sarvagna, Basavanna and others.
The harmonium, the tabla-dagga and a pair of cymbals provide melody and rhythm. For their performances, staged in village squares and fairs, the actors receive food collected in a bag by an assistant accompanying the troupe. Most hagalu veshagaararus belong to the Veerashaiva tradition, while some are Muslims. Sometimes they are addressed as jyaatigaararu ("belonging to the Muslim community"). They are also known as suDugaaDu siddha ("monks of the cemetery") or bahuroopi ("having many disguises").
As their name suggests, they perform primarily during the day (hagalu) and only men take part (including female roles). While entertainment is the main objective, the hagalu veshagararu also educate villagers about mythology and social issues with their performances.
Goravara kunita
Goravara kunita is a dance worshipping Shiva which is popular in the Mysore and North Karnataka regions. In North Karnataka the Goravas worship Mylaralinga. In South Karnataka the Goravas wear black-and-white woollen garments and a black-bear-fur cap (of black bear), and play the damaru and the pillangoovi (flute). In North Karnataka the Goravas wear black woollen garments and a leather shoulder bag; some wear a black coat and white dhoti. The dancers rub crimson powder and vibhooti (sacred ash) on their foreheads. Traditional Gorava devotees dance in a trance, sometimes barking like dogs. The dancers move in a clockwise zigzag, with no fixed choreography. The North Karnataka Goravas wear yellow powder on their foreheads and give Prasada to devotees. Damaru, venu, small bronze bells and cowbells (paarigante) are played.
The dance consists of trance-like movements with no fixed choreography.
Nagamandala
This ritual dance is performed in south Karnataka to tranquilize the serpent spirit, and is an extravagant night-long affair. The dancers (Vaidyas) dance all night around a huge figure, drawn on the ground in natural colors, in a pandal in front of the shrine. The dance is generally performed between December and April.

Maxey Dell "Max" Moody Sr. (December 12, 1883 – July 27, 1949), also known as M. D. Moody, was the founder of M. D. Moody & Sons, Inc. in 1913 and the patriarch of the Moody family of Jacksonville, Florida. His business, M. D. Moody, became the oldest family owned construction equipment distributor in the United States and at one point the largest crane dealer in the southeast. Moody also founded the American Road Builders' Association and was known as the "oldest construction machinery man in Florida."
Early life and family
Maxey Dell Moody was born on December 12, 1883, in Ocala, Florida, to Eliza and Slomon Moody. His father, Dr. Slomon W. Moody (1838–1898), was born in Sumter County, South Carolina, to the Moody family whom were plantation owners. Dr. Moody's parents are relatively unknown and may be either a Slomon Moody or Jesse Moody. Maxey's mother Eliza Moody (née Pearson, 1847–1918) was born in Orange Springs, Florida, to Confederate Captain John William Pearson and Sarah Pearson. Isaac I. Moody Jr. is a distant cousin of Maxey.
Maxey has many siblings and half-siblings due to Slomon's previous marriages. Dr. Slomon became a physician in Marion County for over 30 years until he died on March 20, 1898, at the age of 64 when Maxey was 14. In 1901 Maxey contracted typhoid fever but recovered. Maxey worked at a local drug store until moving to Jacksonville in 1901. In Jacksonville Maxey worked as a traveling salesman and then for Lancaster Automatic Railroad Crossing selling stock in Jacksonville, Ocala, Tampa and Cuba. In 1912 he became a salesman of tobacco.
On April 14, 1909 Max married Ethel Muller, who was born in Germany, at the Church of the Immaculate Conception. Maxey and Ethel were going to Washington, D.C. for their honeymoon but changed it to Tampa due to his mother's illness. They had four children: Dolores "Didi" Dux (1910-2000), Maxey Dell Moody, Jr. (1913-1987), Muller Moody (1917-1976), Ethel "Jean" Butler (1930-2001).
Career
M. D. Moody
In 1915 Moody decided to give up his career in the drug business in favor of the road building industry. For three years he worked as a road grader salesman for J.D. Adams & Company where his initials M.D. gave him the nickname Mule Driver because of his skill in driving mules through demonstrations in road graders. In 1913 Moody decided to establish a road construction company called M. D. Moody in the LaVilla area of Jacksonville to serve the needs of the road building equipment industry. M. D. Moody was initially affiliated with the Cyclone Fence Company until the 1920s. Moody held multiple positions at M. D. Moody as salesman, parts manager and serviceman.
On April 23, 1918, his mother Eliza died. In that same year, the events of World War I in Europe forced Max to register for the draft on September 9, 1918 due to the Selective Service Act of 1916 but he was never sent overseas as the war ended one month later. In 1919 Maxey was a passenger in a bad car accident when his friend, who was driving the car, turned over and was killed. On June 10, 1920 Maxey joined the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine and Scottish Rite at the Morocco Temple in Jacksonville. His business received numerous awards for his contributions to the Shriners.
During the 1920s M. D. Moody entered the marine equipment business by manufacturing their own marine engines and then with the Waukesha Engine dealership. During World War II the business supplied construction equipment needed for the expansion of military bases in Florida. In 1942 M. D. Moody became the sole distributor of the American Hoist & Derrick Company (American Crane and now part of Terex) in Florida.
Incorporation
The two sons of Maxey Moody, Muller and Max Moody Jr., joined the business in the 1940s incorporating it as "M. D. Moody & Sons, Inc." Max Moody's business was still a relatively unknown construction equipment business by 1950. However, his son Maxey Dell Moody Jr. took over his father's business in 1949 upon his death in the same year of a heart attack. By the 1980s M. D. Moody under his son grew substantially to become one of the largest construction equipment distributors in the Southeastern United States.
Death
On July 27, 1949 Maxey suffered a heart attack at the age of 65. He was interred in Evergreen Cemetery. The Florida Times-Union published an article on Maxey's death noting his legacy as the oldest construction machinery man in Florida, founding the American Road Builders' Association, and his memberships in the Scottish Rite and Morocco Temple.
Legacy
Maxey's son Maxey Dell Moody, Jr. became President and diversified its assets with establishments of MOBRO Marine, Inc. in 1962, Moody Fabrication & Machine, Inc. in 1994 and Dell Marine in 2004. Maxey's business M. D. Moody became one of the oldest family-owned construction equipment distributors in the United States under Maxey Dell Moody, Jr. until his death in 1987 and then under Maxey Dell Moody III. After 100 years since its foundation in 1913 M. D. Moody was forced to liquidate. However, three Moody subsidiaries of M. D. Moody still in operation as of 2017 are MOBRO Marine, Dell Marine, and Dell Marine Tug and Barge.
Descendants of Maxey Dell Moody
The descendants of Maxey Moody are numerous consisting of 17 grandchildren, over 21 great grandchildren and many great-great grandchildren. Maxey's full name has been used for several generations of Moody descendants with the latest being Maxey Dell Moody V.

Darren Waterston (born 1965) is an American artist who is mainly known for his ethereal paintings.
Early life and education
Waterson was born in California in 1965. He received his BFA at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. From 1986-87 he studied at the Akademie der Kunst, Berlin, Germany and Fachhochschule für Kunst, Münster, Germany.
Works
In 2011, Waterston finished Forest Eater, which comprised approximately fifty paintings and works on paper and four site-specific sculptures. The largest of the sculptures is "Wrath", a forbidding eighteen-foot long vertical lava formation, which hung from the museum's ceiling. The project was conceived specifically for the Honolulu Contemporary Art Museum.
Filthy Lucre
Filthy Lucre presents a dystopian version of The Peacock Room, James McNeill Whistler's 1876 decorative masterpiece. Waterston's work, like The Peacock Room, probes and considers the conflation of painting, architecture, patronage, and artistic ego. The project was conceived specifically for the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and first exhibited in 2014. In May 2015, it opened at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, while The Peacock Room of the adjoining Freer Gallery of Art undergoes renovation.
Critical reception
Of The Flowering: The Fourfold Sense, DeWitt Cheng wrote: "Darren Waterston's older paintings were lyrical misty landscapes with silhouetted flora and fauna. His newer works, symbolist abstractions, become mindscapes in which ambiguous transparent forms arise, float, flutter, and sink amid mist, clouds, swirls, drips, and vermicular coils of brushstrokes; each image with its poetic cycles of life represents the cosmos as 'a divine chaos.'"
Sue Taylor wrote: "Adept at a myriad of fluid effects, Waterston is a virtuosic colorist as well, enlivening the palest mauve and power-blue fogs with passages of burning orange or hot pink. In these apocalyptic dreams, he imagines flashing, otherworldly realms at the brink of consciousness."
Of Waterston's exhibition Last Days, Regina Hackett wrote: "If there's a more imitated painter in America than Darren Waterston, I can't imagine who it would be. Waterston's silky rot and colored goo are gorgeous. They imply a world in which the air has evolved to carry a weightless and more sophisticated kind of consciousness. Working in oils on panel, Waterston creates worlds inside the world, what Gerald Manley Hopkins' described in God's Grandeur: 'Because the Holy Ghost over the bent/ World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.' In the current exhibit, titled 'Last Days,' Waterston merges beauty with blight. He paints starlight inside a cave, roots in the air, and minerals dissolving into liquids. 'Fallen' features a hollowed-out and free-floating tree trunk. White orchids with stale, shadowed edges hang suspended under fragments of enameled blue sky."

The Soldotna Regional Sports Complex (also referred to as the Soldotna Sports Center) is a 2,000-seat multipurpose arena located in Soldotna, Alaska. The arena opened in 1983. In the winter months, the facility is home to several central Kenai Peninsula high school hockey teams, fighting competitions and the soldotna figure skating team while in the summer the facility hosts numerous local home builders, sports recreation and trading, car, and snowmachine shows, among other events.
The facility contains an Olympic-sized ice sheet, a 350-seat conference room, a first aid room, racquetball courts, locker room facilities, ice-resurfacing capabilities, an ADA-accessible seating platform, and a snack bar. The Sports Center also houses offices for the City of Soldotna's Parks and Recreation Department. Since 2007, it has been the home of the Kenai River Brown Bears of the North American Hockey League.
History
The building's inaugural event in the fall of 1983 featured an exhibition hockey contest showcasing the United States and Russian national hockey teams. Since 1983, the Sports Center has played host to several other sporting events, including Harlem Globetrotters and Anchorage Aces games.
Usually billed as "The Showdown in So-Town," The University of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves Division I men's hockey team have played a pair of recent exhibition contests in front of SRO crowds at the Regional Sports Complex – once in 2004 against Grant MacEwan College (where UAA won 5-1), and again in 2006 against the University of Western Ontario (where UWO won 3-1).
The facility was a focal point for the 2006 Arctic Winter Games, hosting both opening and closing ceremonies, hockey games at all levels, figure skating, and speed skating. For the Arctic Winter Games, the Regional Sports Complex installed a new ice rink, a new four-sided center-hung scoreboard, and a new scrolling marquee outside of the facility.
The facility has also been a focal point for Alaska state high school hockey. High school teams from Soldotna and Kenai share the ice, and the facility also hosts the Peninsula Ice Classic tournament (also referred to for a short time as the Peninsula Ice Challenge) – showcasing all 4A (large school) teams from the Central Peninsula area, as well as one team from the Anchorage (Cook Inlet Conference) and Fairbanks (Mid-Alaska Conference) areas. The facility was also home to the ASAA State High School Hockey Championships from 2000 up until 2004, when the tournament moved to Big Dipper Ice Arena in Fairbanks for 2005 and 2006, then on to the Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Center in 2007.

Donnybrook is a 2018 American-French drama film, written and directed by Tim Sutton. It is based upon the novel of the same name by Frank Bill. It stars Jamie Bell, Frank Grillo, James Badge Dale, and Margaret Qualley.
It had its world premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival, in the Platform program. It was released on February 15, 2019, by IFC Films.
Plot
Jarhead Earl is a former US Marine living with a wife and two kids in a trailer park. Known as a tough guy, he seeks to leave his surroundings in favor of a fresh start for his family, and the only way he sees an out is by winning the Donnybrook, a massive bare-knuckle fight. Earl robs a local gun shop for the money to enter the contest and returns home, encountering Chainsaw Angus (Frank Grillo), a psychotic meth dealer to whom Earl's wife owes money. After a brief struggle, Angus leaves, driven by his sister/accomplice Delia (Margaret Qualley). Earl takes his family and flees the trailer park for the Donnybrook.
Angus and Delia return to their cookhouse and see it up in flames. After killing their cooker who escaped the fire, they pay a visit to their partner, Eldon (Pat Healy) seeking money to restart their operation. When he refuses, Angus orders Delia to kill him. She does, but has sex with Eldon first; while doing so, Eldon tells Delia that she should kill Angus instead. Delia kills Eldon, but continues to be abused and belittled by Angus. Eventually, Delia is driven to contemplate suicide, but relents, instead going to Angus and shooting him. Overhearing Earl's plans to enter the Donnybrook earlier, she takes a stash of meth and sets out for the Donnybrook as well. However, Angus is not dead, and after killing an innocent for his car, he vows to find his sister and his meth.
Meanwhile, Whalen, a local cop with a drinking problem, is investigating the gun shop robbery as well as the fire at the cookhouse. Running into his ex-girlfriend, she tells him about Angus. Whalen makes taking down Angus his personal mission, finally confronting him in a parking lot. The two men shoot at each other with shotguns. Angus fatally wounds Whalen and leaves him for dead.
Angus tracks down Earl's son and kills him. He arrives at the site of the Donnybrook, sneaks up on Delia, and drags her into the woods where he strangles her to death. The Donnybrook begins in a chain link cage as a no holds barred melee. After a few minutes of fighting, Earl and Angus are the last fighters standing. They are given a break before they face off against each other. Angus uses the break to tell Earl that he killed his son. Back in the cage, Earl eventually manages to overpower Angus, shouting "You killed my boy!" as he breaks Angus' neck.

The Zika (or Ziika) Forest () is a tropical forest near Entebbe in Uganda. means "overgrown" in the Luganda language. As the property of the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) of Entebbe, it is protected and restricted to scientific research.
The forest covers an area of about next to the swamps of Waiya Bay, an inlet of Lake Victoria. Easily accessible and combining several ecosystems, the Zika Forest is well suited to the study of mosquitoes. According to the UVRI, the size of the research area of the forest is about . The forest has a rich biodiversity in plants and moths, and is home to about 40 types of mosquitoes. The UVRI also maintains an insectarium.
The forest is also accessible to visitors for bird watching. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter once visited the forest for that purpose.
The Zika virus as well as the moths Sidisca zika and Milocera zika are named after the forest.
The Zika Forest is where the infected Aedes mosquito first spread Zika to rhesus monkeys, then spreading further to humans.
Mosquito studies
Investigations of mosquitoes at Zika started in 1946 as part of the study of human yellow fever at the Yellow Fever Research Institute (renamed East African Virus Research Institute in 1950, and then Uganda Virus Research Institute in 1977), established in Entebbe, Uganda in 1936 by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1947, the Zika virus was isolated from a rhesus monkey stationed at Zika. In 1960, a 36.6-metre (120-ft) steel tower was moved from Mpanga Forest to Zika to study the vertical distribution of mosquitoes, allowing for a comprehensive study of the mosquito population in 1964. In that same year, the Zika virus was identified from a collected Aedes africanus sample. No routine mosquito collections were performed for about the next four decades, while human activities encroached on the forest. An updated mosquito collection finally took place in 2009 and 2010.
The name Zika has been made notorious by the Zika virus, involved in a growing number of outbreaks around the globe from 2007 onwards.

The dabbaba, also known as the dabaaba or dabbabah, is a fairy chess piece that jumps two squares orthogonally (the directions a rook can move), leaping over any intermediate piece. In algebraic notation, it is given the symbol D.
History and nomenclature
The dabbaba is a very old piece, appearing in some very early chess variants, such as Tamerlane chess.
The name dabbaba (Arabic: دَبَّابَة) means "tank" in Modern Arabic. In older Arabic, it referred to a type of medieval siege engine designed to shelter men who are digging a hole in enemy fortifications (Latin: vinea). The name has sometimes been translated as "war engine". The name dabbaba was also used for other pieces in old chess variants, such as one that moved like the modern bishop.
Value
The dabbaba by itself is not much more powerful than a pawn, but as an additional power to other pieces, it is worth about half a knight. Its value as a piece by itself is severely compromised by its being "twice-colourbound"—able to reach only a quarter of the squares on the 8×8 chessboard. Combining it with other pieces usually masks this weakness to some extent. A king and four dabbabas, with each dabbaba covering a different quarter of the chessboard, can easily force checkmate on a bare king.

Clade was born in Hambach, now part of Neustadt an der Weinstraße in Rheinland-Pfalz. After completing his schooling, he originally trained to become a merchant. However, he became interested in aviation in 1934, and became a glider pilot, participating in the German national civilian aviator's competition.
Military career
Joining the Luftwaffe in April 1937, Clade was initially certified to fly the Junkers Ju 52. However, he quickly moved to become a fighter pilot.
World War II
Clade served with 1./JG 1, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109. He scored his first kill on 11 May 1940 near Maastricht, Netherlands against a Belgian Air Force Gloster Gladiator biplane of 1/I/2. On the evening of the same day, he claimed a French LeO 451 twin-engine bomber of GB I/12 or GB II/12, also in the Maastricht area. Victories over an RAF Spitfire and Morane MS.406 followed in May and June 1940. Encountering Supermarine Spitfires for the first time over Dunkirk, Clade was impressed saying that the British fighters were almost the Germans' equals. During the Battle of Britain, Clade flew approximately 80 combat missions over Britain.
In March 1941, Clade was made an instructor attached to Jagdgeschwader 27 into which 1./JG 1 had been merged, and stayed with this fighter unit for essentially all his remaining wartime career.
By now an oberfeldwebel, Clade was assigned to the Mediterranean theatre with 5./JG 27, operating from bases in North Africa alongside legendary "Star of Africa" Hans-Joachim Marseille. On 7 August 1942, he indirectly made a potentially decisive impact on the future course of the African campaign, although he was most likely unaware of the fact at the time. Airborne over the desert south of Alexandria in Egypt, he chanced upon a Bristol Bombay transport of No. 216 Squadron RAF, flown by 19-year-old Sergeant Pilot H.E. 'Jimmy' James, who was flying Lieutenant General William Gott, the newly appointed Commander of the British 8th Army, to a staff meeting in Cairo. The plane was also carrying a number of wounded British soldiers. Clade's attack forced the transport to crash land and the subsequent strafing run by fellow JG 27 pilot Bernd Schneider killed Gott and most other British troops inside the wreckage on the ground.
While still flying in Egypt, having been promoted to Leutnant, Clade recorded his 10th air claim on 5 July 1942 when he shot down an RAF Spitfire fighter near El-Daba. With 17 air victories to his credit, Clade was appointed Staffelkapitän of 7./JG 27 on 23 May 1943.
By January 1945, Clade was acting Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG 27, and lead the Gruppe in combat in Operation Bodenplatte. Clade led the gruppe an escort mission against Utrecht. In a subsequent airfield attack against Melsbroek, Clade said the AAA positions were not manned, and aircraft were bunched together or in lines, which made perfect targets. The attack caused considerable damage among the units based there and was a great success. The Recce Wings had lost two entire squadrons worth of machines. No. 69 Squadron RAF lost 11 Vickers Wellingtons and two damaged. No. 140 Squadron RAF lost four Mosquitoes, the losses being made good the same day. At least five Spitfires from No. 16 Squadron RAF were destroyed. No. 271 Squadron RAF lost at least seven Harrow transports "out of action". A further 15 other aircraft were destroyed. 139 Wing reported five B-25s destroyed and five damaged. Some 15 to 20 USAAF bombers were also destroyed. Another source states that 13 Wellingtons were destroyed, as were five Mosquitoes, four Auster and five Avro Ansons from the Tactical Air Forces 2nd Communications Squadron. Three Spitfires were also lost and two damaged. At least one RAF Transport Command Douglas Dakota was destroyed. The pilots of JG 27 and 54 claimed 85 victories and 40 damaged. German reconnaissance was able to confirm 49. JG 27 suffered unacceptable losses; 17 Bf 109s, 11 pilots killed, one wounded and three captured. IV./JG 54 lost two killed and one captured. Three Fw 190s were lost and one damaged.
Clade and his fellow Gruppenkommandeur Peter Werfft disbanded the remainder of their unit near Saalbach between 3 May and 8 May 1945 and became prisoners of war. Clade finished the war as with the rank of Hauptmann, and was credited with 27 victories, including two four-engine bombers. Nine claims were made over the Western Front, with the remainder being in North Africa.
Clade was himself shot down six times, including in aerial combat on 5 October 1943 (during a mission resulting in his 18th victory), on 26 November 1944 and on 25 February 1945 (immediately after his 27th and last air kill). He also sustained severe injuries in a Resistance attack on 16 February 1944 when he was serving in France near Avignon.
Postwar career
Clade survived in various minor jobs after his release from a prisoner of war camp. He applied to become a civilian pilot with the newly formed Lufthansa in 1956 but was turned down because he exceeded the age limit by two years. However, he continued as a private aviator, was successful in various German competitions, and helped to set up local aviation associations.
In 1996 he published his memoirs of his service in the war.
He died in 2010, at the age of 94.

Lovemore Moyo (born 29 January 1965) is a Zimbabwean politician who was Speaker of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe from 2008 to 2013. He was the National Chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change - Tsvangirai (MDC-T) party led by Morgan Tsvangirai from 2006 to 2018.
Political career
Moyo joined the Zimbabwe African People's Union during the Rhodesian Bush War. He was based in Zambia until 1980. He later joined a political pressure group called Open Forum. He is a founding member of the Forum Party of Zimbabwe. He later founded a political and cultural pressure group Imbavane Yamahlabezulu.
In 1999 Moyo became a founding member of the MDC. He was elected Secretary of the Matabeleland South Provincial Executive and also a National Council Member. In June 2000 he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Matobo Constituency in Matabeleland South Province. He was a member of the Portfolio Committee on Education, Sport and Culture and on Public Accounts Committee.
In the March 2005 parliamentary election, Moyo was re-elected to represent the same constituency and continued to serve on the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Education, Sport and Culture and on Public Accounts. He is also a member of the SADC Parliamentary Forum (SADC PF).
Speaker of the House of Assembly
In 2006, Moyo succeeded Isaac Matongo as National Chairman of the MDC. In the March 2008 parliamentary election, Moyo was re-elected to the House of Assembly as an MDC-Tsvangirai candidate from Matobo North constituency. He received 3,503 votes, defeating Kotsho Dube of ZANU-PF, who received 3,102 votes. When Parliament first met for its new term on 25 August 2008, Moyo was elected as Speaker of Parliament, receiving 110 out of 208 votes in the House of Assembly in a secret ballot. Moyo reportedly received 99 votes from MDC-Tsvangirai faction MPs, seven votes from MDC-Mutambara faction MPs, and four votes from ZANU-PF MPs. ZANU-PF did not present a candidate against Moyo and instead supported Paul Themba Nyathi of the Movement for Democratic Change faction led by Arthur Mutambara.
Following his election as Speaker, Moyo predicted that Parliament would henceforth be a meaningful check on the executive, which would need to "find ways of negotiating with the legislature in order to put through programs". Although he pledged that he would be neutral in presiding over the House of Assembly, he also suggested that he would not set aside the MDC position that Robert Mugabe's re-election in the 2008 presidential election was illegitimate.

Scatterbrain (Will Deguchi) is a fictional character, a superhero in the Marvel Universe, member of the Strikeforce: Morituri. The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson.
Publication history
Scatterbrain (Will Deguchi) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #6 (May 1987). The codename "Scatterbrain" was introduced in issue #8, in which he also joined the title cast of Strikeforce: Morituri. Scatterbrain remained in the regular cast of the book until his incapacitation in issue #18. He finally died in issue #24, the last character of the series to die of the infamous "Morituri effect". Subsequent issues saw appearances of what appeared to be his ghost, until, in the Strikeforce: Morituri: Electric Undertow miniseries, it was revealed to be sentient artificial intelligence modelled after the late Scatterbrain. The character's surname and design indicates that he is at least partially of Japanese origin.
Fictional character biography
Almost nothing is known of Will Deguchi's life prior to his decision to join Strikeforce: Morituri. Apparently, at a young age, possibly as a child, he experienced a devastating earthquake in Missouri, an experience he used years later to telepathically project it in battle. In 2073, the young Deguchi decided to volunteer for the Morituri program, hoping to assist in the ongoing war of Earth against the alien invaders known as the Horde. The aforementioned program granted superhuman powers to ordinary humans, in turn transforming them into super-powered soldiers against the Horde. However, the process came at a terrible price, a fatal flaw which ensured that its recipients would die within a year of receiving the process, due to the unstable nature of this "transformation".
Nevertheless, after proving genetically compatible for the process, Deguchi decided to undergo it. Deguchi was the last of the so-called second generation of Morituri to go through the process, preceded by Toxyn and Scaredycat. After going through the process, Deguchi, like most Morituri, was instructed to participate in a test in the booby-trapped Biowar Facility Alpha (nicknamed "the Garden"), so that his powers would burst forth under extreme pressure and stress. However, Deguchi almost died in the process of facing the deadly traps of the test environment. He was eventually saved by the doctors of the Morituri program, although his left leg was irretrievably damaged. Feeling guilty for him, the inventor of the Morituri process and the Garden facility, Dr. Kimmo Tuolema, designed a leg brace for Deguchi, which became a permanent part of his. Having now developed the ability to project emotions, but in a rather unfocused manner and across groups of people, Deguchi was given the humorous codename "Scatterbrain" by his teammate, Pilar Lysieux, in turn giving her the codename "Scaredycat", because of her ability to induce panic and fear to others. The three Morituri soon met with their senior members and participated in their first official battle.
Later, thanks to the data that fellow member Adept had accumulated from a mission of the team in the Horde fleet in outer space, special boots that enabled flight were designed and handed out to the Morituri. Thanks to the flight boots, an enthusiastic Scatterbrain overcame any kinetic problems posed by his smashed leg.
Initially, Scatterbrain could only transmit psychological conditions, ranging from drunkenness and sobriety to fear and nausea, albeit in an unfocused manner, often affecting his own teammates if they were in the vicinity, against his own will. Over time, his control over his power increased and it became more sophisticated. His telepathy grew to the point he was now also able to sense the emotions and read the minds of his fellow Morituri.
Power boost
Months later, during a battle against the super-powered Super Hordians seemed to have their match. Simultaneously, a new batch of Morituri were going through the process, albeit without the supervision of Dr. Tuolema. The carelessness of the scientists' team during the process led to the four new volunteers being transformed into enormities. One of the horribly disfigured Morituri, on his despair, manifested a telepathic ability that enabled him to connect to the other Morituri. In agony, the new Morituri reached out to fellow Morituri - and telepath - Scatterbrain, and through him, unleashed a powerful psychic blast that slew all the Super Hordians.
The team realized that something was horribly wrong and they visited the Morituri base, where they witnessed the results of the operators' carelessness. Scatterbrain telepathically interrogated the chief operator and realized that it didn't matter to him what they had done and they would be willing to do it again, regardless of the sacrifice. Repulsed by the stance of the operator, Scatterbrain incapacitated. With the Horde launching an attack against the Morituri base, Scatterbrain felt like they were working monsters - the Paedia World Government - and suggested to his teammates they do nothing and just die all together in the hands of the Horde, like they deserved. However, the new Morituri decided to help them and the telepathic one among them temporarily used Scatterbrain as a vessel to announce their decision. After Scatterbrain's powers vanquished the Hordians, fellow member Silencer euthanized the monstrous Morituri, relieving them from their misery.
Coma and death
Following this incident, Scatterbrain grew increasingly obsessed with death and what lay beyond it. Furthermore, his mental connection with the telepathic Morituri had left his powers significantly enhanced; he could focus his powers, but could not stop himself from sensing every thought and emotion of the others, mentally "hearing" everything. Around the same time, Scaredycat started making romantic advances towards him and the two began forming a romance. However, now manifesting clairsentience, Scatterbrain foresaw that she would be the next one to die of the Morituri effect, and informed her of the fact, which she faced quite stoically. Shortly afterwards, the Morituri faced some Hordians and killed one of their highest warlords. Scatterbrain locked into the dying alien's mind, longing to see what awaited him after death. Seeing only darkness and pain, an agonizing Scatterbrain lashed out with his psychic powers and inadvertently killed the remaining Hordians. However, the traumatic experience also caused him to withdraw into a self-induced coma.
For the next few months, Scatterbrain remained in coma, until he died peacefully, never waking from his coma, having almost exhausted the one-year limit of the Morituri effect. He was the last member of his generation to die.
Artificial intelligence
In the same morning that Scatterbrain died, new team member Scanner was visited in his dreams by what appeared to be Scatterbrain. "Scatterbrain" warned him of the "new ones" (the alien race known as VXX199), the conspiracy of the corrupt politician Andre Lemont, and his teammate Shear. When Scanner woke up, he checked on the comatose Scatterbrain, only to discover he had just died of the Morituri effect that morning. All of Scatterbrain's warnings proved correct. Later, while being unconscious, Scanner was again visited in his dreams by Scatterbrain, who reiterated his warnings.
Ten years after the conspiracy was revealed, Scanner was again visited by the ghost of the late Scatterbrain, who warned him of the VXX199 and their subtle efforts to take over the word. Eventually, this new "Scatterbrain" revealed he was an artificial intelligence, which had been developed by the United States of America in late 20th century, for military purposes. The then rival of the USA, the Soviet Union, tried to erase the A.I. with a virus, but failed, only making it stronger, as it grew to become a sentient entity. The A.I. then took over world communications and began influencing global developments, spreading false information or appointing certain politicians. The A.I. essentially pulled the strings that led to the formation of a World Government and, after the war with the Horde started, the formation of Morituri. The A.I. was controlling powerful politician Lamont, until he began being influenced by a mysterious outside source.
Wishing to investigate, the A.I. entered the comatose Scatterbrain's mind through a bio-chip implant in his brain and copied his powers and personality. With Scatterbrain's psychic powers, the A.I. reached space and discovered about the nefarious plans of the seemingly benevolent alien race of the VXX199. The A.I. created a construct-personality program from Scatterbrain's memories and entered Scanner's dreams, through Scanner's own bio-chip implant in the brain, where he proceeded to warn him, while posing as Scatterbrain. Calling himself "Will", from the last Will Deguchi, the A.I. helped Scanner and the other surviving Morituri to destroy the VXXX199, although it also warned them of new perils waiting in the future.

Lucius Aurelius Commodus Pompeianus ( 177 – 211/212) was a Roman senator active in the early 3rd century. He was the son of Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus Aurelius, and her second husband Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus, a general active politically during the reigns of Emperors Commodus and Pertinax.
Little is known of Pompeianus himself. As Oates expresses it, "He has a ringing name of great auctoritas, but we do not know if he was capax imperii." He dedicated an altar for the welfare of Septimius Severus and his family in Lyon while serving as military tribune in the Legio I Minervia, which would date his commission to the early years of Severus' reign, in the 190s. In 209, he achieved the rank of consul. If Pompeianus became consul suo anno, as John Oates suggests, then he was born in 177, and was five years old when his mother Lucilla was executed in the aftermath of a failed attempt to assassinate her brother Commodus. John Oates opines that he and his father Tiberius had retired to their country estates in 180 when Commodus ascended to the throne.
In 211/212, he was executed by Caracalla, following the murder of Caracalla's brother Geta. H.-G. Pflaum notes that Caracalla took the precaution of making the murder appear to have been perpetrated by bandits.
Lucius Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus (cos. ord. 231) and Clodius Pompeianus (cos. ord. 241) are likely to have been his sons.

Associazione Calcio Rodengo Saiano was an Italian association football club located in Rodengo-Saiano, (BS), Lombardy Italy.
Their colors were yellow and blue.
History
The club was founded in 1983.
Four years in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione
In the Serie D 2006-07 season, Rodengo finished first in Girone D, thus winning promotion for the first time ever to Serie C2, the fourth tier of Italian football. It participated in the Scudetto Dilettanti tournament but was eliminated in the group stage.
In the Serie C2 2007-08 regular season, Rodengo finished a surprising third in Girone A, and qualified for the promotional playoffs. The team was defeated by fourth-placed Lumezzane in the semi-finals, 2–1 on aggregate, thus remaining in the, now called, Lega Pro Seconda Divisione for the 2008–09 season.
Also in the 2008–09 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione Rodengo finishing fourth in Girone A, is qualified for the promotional playoffs. The team was eliminated by third-placed Lumezzane in the semi-finals, 1–1 on aggregate, for the worst placement in the league, thus remaining in the, now called, Lega Pro Seconda Divisione for the 2009–10 season.
Instead in the 2009–10 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione Rodengo finishing only seventh in Girone A and eighth in the 2010–11 season.
The liquidation
It didn't join 2011–12 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and excluded from all football.

PDE3 is a phosphodiesterase. The PDEs belong to at least eleven related gene families, which are different in their primary structure, substrate affinity, responses to effectors, and regulation mechanism.
Most of the PDE families are composed of more than one gene. PDE3 is clinically significant because of its role in regulating heart muscle, vascular smooth muscle and platelet aggregation. PDE3 inhibitors have been developed as pharmaceuticals, but their use is limited by arrhythmic effects and they can increase mortality in some applications.
Function
PDE3 enzymes are involved in regulation of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contractility. Molecules that inhibit PDE3 were originally investigated for the treatment of heart failure, but, because of unwanted arrhythmic side-effects, they are not studied for that indication any longer. Nonetheless, the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone is approved for use in heart failure in intravenous form.
Both PDE3A and PDE3B are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and are likely to modulate contraction. Their expression in vascular smooth muscle is altered under specific conditions such as elevated cAMP and hypoxia.
Isoforms and genes
The PDE3 family in mammals consists of two members, PDE3A and PDE3B. The PDE3 isoforms are structurally similar, containing an N-terminal domain important for the localization and a C-terminus end. The 44-amino acid insertion in the catalytic domain differs in the PDE3 isoforms, and the N-terminal portions of the isoforms are quite divergent. PDE3A and PDE3B have strikingly similar pharmacological and kinetic properties, but the distinction is in expression profiles and affinity for cGMP.
The PDE3 family is composed of two genes, PDE3A and PDE3B. In cells expressing both genes, PDE3A is usually dominant. Three different variants of PDE3A (PDE3A1-3) are products of alternate startcodon usage of the PDE3A gene. The PDE3B encodes a single isoform only.
In their full-length both PDE3A and PDE3B contain two N-terminal hydrophobic membrane association regions, NHR1 and NHR2 (figure 2). The difference of the PDE3A1-3 variants lies in whether they include:
both NHR1 and NHR2
only NHR2
neither NHR1 nor the NHR2.
The last can be predicted to be exclusively on soluble/cytosolic form.
Tissue distribution
PDE3A is mainly implicated in cardiovascular function and fertility but PDE3B is mainly implicated in lipolysis. Table 1 is an overview of localization of the PDE3 isoforms.
In general, PDE3 can be either cytosolic or membrane-bound and has been associated to plasma membrane, sarcoplasmic reticulum, golgi, and nucleus envelope.
PDE3B is predominantly membrane-associated, and is localized to endoplasmic reticulum and microsomal fractions.
PDE3A can be either membrane-associated or cytosolic, depending on the variant and the cell type it is expressed in.
Regulation
PDE3A and PDE3B activity is regulated by several phosphorylation pathways. Protein kinase A and Protein kinase B both activate PDE3A and PDE3B via phosphorylation at two different phosphorylation sites (P1 and P2) between NHR1 and NHR2 (figure 2). Hydrolysis of cAMP by PDE3 isoforms is also directly inhibited by cGMP, although PDE3B is only ≈10% as sensitive to cGMP inhibition as PDE3A.
The PDE3B has been extensively studied for its importance in mediating the antilipolytic and antiglycogenlytic effect of insulin in adipose and liver tissues. The activation of PDE3B in adipocytes is associated with phosphorylation of serine residue by an insulin-stimulated protein serine kinase (PDE3IK). By blocking insulin activation of PDE3IK, and in turn phosphorylation/activation of PDE3B, the antilipolytic effect of insulin can be antagonized. Activation of PDE3B decreases concentrations of cAMP, which in turn reduces Protein kinase A activity. Protein kinase A is responsible for activation of lipase, which induces lipolysis as well as other physiological pathways.
Whether phosphorylation pathways, which regulate activity of PDE3A or PDE3B, could serve as potential drug targets rather than the catalytic domain of the PDE3 enzyme itself is unclear and beyond the scope of this text.
Structure
The mammalian PDEs share a common structural organization and contain three functional domains, which include the conserved catalytic core, a regulatory N-terminus, and the C-terminus. The conserved catalytic core is much more similar within PDE families, with about 80% amino acid identity, than between different families. It is believed that the core contains common structural elements that are important for the hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP phosphodiester bonds. It is also believed that it contains family-specific determinants for differences in affinity for substrates and sensitivity for inhibitors.
The catalytic domain of PDE3 is characterized by a 44-amino acid insert, but this insert is unique to the PDE3 family, and is a factor when determining a structure for a potent and selective PDE3 inhibitor.
The crystal structure of the catalytic domains of several PDEs, including PDE3B, have shown that they contain three helical subdomains:
N-terminal cyclin fold region
Linker region
C-terminal helical bundle
At the interface of these domains a deep hydrophobic pocket is formed by residues that are highly conserved among all PDEs. This pocket is the active site and is composed of four subsites :
Metal binding site (M site)
Core pocket (Q pocket)
Hydrophobic pocket (H pocket)
Lid region (L region)
The M site is at the bottom of the hydrophobic binding pocket and contains two divalent metal binding sites. The metal ions that can bind to these sites are either zinc or magnesium. The zinc binding site has two histidine and two aspartic acid residues that are absolutely conserved among those PDE's studied to date.
The N-terminal portions of PDEs are widely divergent and contain determinants that are associated with regulatory properties specific to different gene families. For PDE3, those determinants are the hydrophobic membrane association domains and cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites.
Substrate affinity
At first, the PDE3s were purified and described as enzymes that hydrolyse both cGMP and cAMP with Km values between 0.1 – 0.8 μM. However the Vmax for cAMP hydrolysis is 4 – 10 times higher than Vmax for cGMP hydrolysis.
When different PDEs were first identified, two types of PDEs (PDE3 and PDE4) that exhibited high affinities for cAMP were isolated. PDE3 exhibited high affinity for both cGMP and cAMP, but PDE4 had high affinity for only cAMP. For that reason, the PDE3 was called the cGMP-inhibited PDE to distinguish it from PDE4.
The 44-amino acid insertion in the catalytic domain of PDE3s is believed to be involved in PDE3's interaction with its substrate and inhibitors, but that remains to be established.
The proposed molecular mechanism of cyclic nucleotide specificity of PDEs is the so-called glutamine switch mechanism.
In the PDEs that have had their structure solved, there seems to be an invariant glutamine residue that stabilizes the binding of the purine ring in the active site (binding pocket). The g-amino group of the glutamine residue can alternatively adopt two different orientations:
The hydrogen bond network supports guanine binding – cGMP selectivity
The hydrogen bond network supports adenine binding – cAMP selectivity.
In PDEs that can hydrolyse both cGMP and cAMP (PDE3s), the glutamine can rotate freely and therefore switch between orientations.
Active site
From early studies an initial model of PDE, active site topography was derived. This early model can be summarized into the following steps concerning cAMP active site topography:
cAMP substrate with its adenine and ribose moieties in an "anti" relationship
The phosphate atom in cAMP binds to PDE active site, using an arginine residue and a water molecule, which was initially associated with Mg2+. A second arginine residue and the Mg2+ may also play roles during binding and/or play roles in the next step
SN2 attack of phosphorus by H2O with formation of a trigonal bipyramid transition state
5´-AMP is formed as an "inverted" product. Electronic charges conserve the net charge overall and across the transition state
Inhibitors
PDE3 inhibitors:
antagonize platelet aggregation
block oocyte maturation
increase contractility of the heart
enhance vascular smooth muscle relaxation
enhance airway smooth muscle relaxation
It has been demonstrated that PDE3A inhibition prevents oocyte maturation in vitro and in vivo. For example, when mice are made completely deficient of PDE3A, they become infertile.
Aggregation of platelets is highly regulated by cyclic nucleotides. PDE3A is a regulator of this process, and PDE3 inhibitors effectively prevent aggregation of platelets. Cilostazol is approved for treatment of intermittent claudication and is thought to involve inhibition of platelet aggregation and also inhibition of smooth muscle proliferation and vasodilation.
The most studied roles of PDE3B have been in the areas of insulin, IGF1, and leptin signaling. When PDE3B is overexpressed in β-cells in mice, it causes impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance.
Cancer
PDE3a expression has been described as a biomarker for sensitivity for PDE3-inhibitor Zardaverine in different types of cancer.
Asthma
Targeting PDE3 with optimal doses and timing, enoximone prevents allergic inflammation in HDM-driven models of allergic airway inflammation. PDE3 inhibitors enoximone and milrinone can be used as a rescue drug in life-threatening bronchial asthma/acute severe asthma.

The 1897 South Carolina United States Senate election was a unanimous election of the Democratic nominee on January 26, 1897 to select the U.S. Senator from the state of South Carolina. The Democratic primary election was held on August 26, 1896 and September 9. Prior to the ratification of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Senators were elected by the state legislature and not through the direct election by the people of the state. However, the Democratic Party of South Carolina organized primary elections for the U.S. Senate beginning in 1896 and the General Assembly would confirm the choice of the Democratic voters. Conservative Democratic Joseph H. Earle won the Democratic primary and was elected by the General Assembly for a six-year term.
Democratic primary
In 1896, Governor of South Carolina John Gary Evans entered the first ever election in the state of South Carolina for the U.S. Senate. He had the backing of Senator Ben Tillman and much of the farming interests in the state. However, the farmers' movement had largely run its course and the Tillmanite reform movement had angered a considerable number of voters in the state. Conservative Joseph H. Earle and Newberry native John T. Duncan announced their candidacy's in opposition to Governor Evans. In the primary on August 26 Evans emerged as the frontrunner, but did not garner over 50% of the vote and was forced to face Earle in a runoff election. Those who had voted for Duncan threw their support to Earle and it provided him with the margin he needed for victory over Evans.

Christopher John Wilkinson (1 July 1945 – 14 December 2021) was a British architect and co-founder of the architecture firm WilkinsonEyre. He was known for his techno-centric designs and execution of projects ranging from office spaces, factory floors, skyscrapers to botanical gardens. Some of his projects included the Magna Science Adventure Centre, Gateshead Millennium Bridge, Guangzhou International Finance Center, and the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore.
Wilkinson was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 2006, and was awarded an OBE in the Millennium Honours List for his contributions to architecture. His firm, WilkinsonEyre, was the first to win back to back RIBA Stirling Prizes in 2001 and 2002.
Early life
Wilkinson was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, on 1 July 1945. His mother Norma (née Treleaven Beer) had participated in World War II, while his father was a surveyor with the British multinational consumer goods company Unilever. He studied at St Albans School, Hertfordshire, where he was introduced to art foundation and drawing. He graduated with a degree in architecture from the Polytechnic of Central London in 1970.
Career
Wilkinson started his career working for the English architect Denys Lasdun who was then working on the Royal National Theatre. During this period he took some time off to travel to Greece. During this time, he came into contact with the works of English architects Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. He returned back and applied to both of their design firms and later joined Norman Foster's firm in 1971. At the firm, he worked with Foster's partner, Michael Hopkins and went on to work for Hopkins when he started his own firm in 1976. Some of the projects that Wilkinson worked on during this time included renovation of 10 Trinity Square, which was to be Willis Faber and Dumas' headquarters, and Greene King Brewery. In 1981, he moved on to work with Richard Rogers's firm, where he worked on the Lloyd's of London building. Working with Foster, Hopkins, and Rogers, he was exposed to the British modernist movement in architecture called hi-tech architecture that believed in exposing and expressing a building's structure.
Wilkinson started his own design firm in 1983 and partnered with Jim Eyre in 1987 to form WilkinsonEyre. The duo initially worked on smaller projects handed down by Rogers and Hopkins. Their first major work was the design for the Stratford Market Depot on the London Underground's Jubilee line extension. The project included maintenance facilities, office spaces, and other related facilities, and was built as a large steel structure with a long arc supported by steel columns, in what would later go on to become a hallmark of the duo's designs. The work was documented in his book Supersheds (1991) and revived interest in the concept of an "universal space" which included steel space-frames that held suspended canopies and would be the foundation for many structures including railway stations, supermarkets, and even airports.
Wilkinson worked on the Dyson company's headquarters in Malmesbury in 1992. His partnership with the company's founder James Dyson would continue for over three decades and include many facilities including offices, and even the student accommodation for Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology. The flagship store that he designed for the company in Paris in 2000 had them placing vacuums on pedestals like artwork. The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about the work and said that "It began a trend for technology stores designed like contemporary art galleries, which brands such as Apple and Samsung have since taken to extremes."
Wilkinson's 2001 work on the Magna Science Adventure Centre in Rotherham, won the firm a RIBA Stirling Prize. The work was considered a post-industrial design aiming to reimagine huge and redundant steelworks within large industrial buildings. Similarly, his work on the Gateshead Millennium Bridge across the Tyne, also called as "blinking bridge" had two giant parabolic arcs, one for pedestrian movement and the other supporting it and rotating on an axis is considered an icon of the region's riverside regeneration program. The firm won their second Stirling prize in 2002 for this work, making it the only firm to win the award in back-to-back years. Around this time, Wilkinson and his firm took up international projects including the Guangzhou International Finance Center a skyscraper in Guangzhou in China, and the Gardens by the Bay, an urban nature park in Singapore. Both of these projects won RIBA's Lubetkin international prize in 2012 and 2013.
Some of his other projects included the Mary Rose Museum, Liverpool Arena and Convention Centre, Waterfront Museum Swansea, Forum Project at University of Exeter, the new Earth Sciences building at Oxford University, and the Crown Sydney Hotel. In 2018, his firm was commissioned by the Marylebone Cricket Club to redesign the Compton and Edrich stands at Lord's Cricket Ground, which was completed in 2021. Earlier, in 2015, Wilkinson was commissioned to redevelop Victorian-era industrial gasholders in Kings Cross, London into modern residential apartments and office spaces, in what was then one of the largest regeneration projects in Europe. Wilkinson said that the project built on an idea of a watch, with the gasholders' interlocking cylinders resembling the watch's movement mechanism with cogs and gears. Wilkinson and his firm were also commissioned to redevelop the Battersea Power Station into an mixed office, retail, and residential space. The project is expected to open in 2022 and include Apple's UK headquarters amongst others.
Wilkinson was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 2006, granted an Honorary Fellowship of the American Institute of Architecture in 2007, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Millennium Honours List for his contribution to architecture. He became a Commissioner of English Heritage in 2007 having previously been a member of the English Heritage/ Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment Urban Panel.
In addition to his practice work, Wilkinson won awards for his work with art and design. In 1996, he was named designer of the year by both the Design Council and FX. His publications include Supersheds, an exploration of the history and evolution of large-volume universal spaces. His sketchbooks that documented his thinking and design process were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 2015. Wilkinson painted, working with acrylic paints.
Personal life
Wilkinson married his wife Diana (née Edmunds) in 1976. She was a supermodel in the 1970s and later went on to be an artist. The couple had two children.
Wilkinson died on 14 December 2021, at the age of 76.

Cinque Hommes Creek is a tributary of the Mississippi River flowing through Perry County, Missouri.
Name
The early Colonial French name for the creek was "à la viande" or "with meat". Cinque Hommes Creek was named after Cape Cinque Hommes on the Mississippi River, although this name most likely originates from the Canadian Catholic missionary priest Father Jean Francois Buisson de St. Cosme. The pronunciation of "St. Cosme" and "Cinque Hommes" is exactly the same in French, and the early Frenchmen who came after father St. Cosme, misunderstanding, called it by the latter name.
Physical geography
The stream rises in Cinque Hommes Township in Perry County, Missouri, and takes a winding course through Central and Salem townships. Its mouth empties into the Mississippi River near Menfro not far from Cape Cinque Hommes. Five cave systems are found within the Cinque Hommes Creek drainage: Moore Cave, Crevice Cave, Mystery Cave, Rimstone River Cave and Running Bull Cave.
A number of tributaries flow into Cinque Hommes Creek:
Cultural geography
A number of bridges have crossed Cinque Hommes Creek over the years. The Cinque Hommes Creek Route B Bridge was a truss bridge built in 1888, and collapsed on April 15, 1962, following a collusion by an overweight truck. It was replaced in 1963. The Cinque Hommes US 61 Bridge was a truss bridge built in 1930, and replaced in 1996 with a stringer bridge. Cinque Hommes Creek empties into the Mississippi River south of Menfro, Missouri in the Red Rock Landing Conversation Area.
History
Cape St. Cosme or Cape Cinque Hommes - a point on the Mississippi River - was conferred for Father Jean Francois Buisson de Saint Cosme (1667-1702), a missionary priest from the Quebec Seminary of Foreign Missions, who visited the spot in 1698 and erected a cross on Grand Tower. Jean St. Cosme was the son of Michael Buisson, a native of Cosme le Vert in the Diocese of Mans in France, and of Susanne Licheraffe. He was ordained a Seminarian priest at the age of twenty-three. Father St. Cosme was stationed first at Tamaroa, in Illinois, and also labored in Acadia, Louisiana, and among the Natchez Indians in Lower Louisiana. He was massacred by a party of the Chitimacha Indians while descending the Mississippi in 1702.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:D6 polytope}}
In 6-dimensional geometry, there are 47 uniform polytopes with D6 symmetry, 16 are unique, and 31 are shared with the B6 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 6-orthoplex, and 6-demicube with 12 and 32 vertices respectively.
They can be visualized as symmetric orthographic projections in Coxeter planes of the D6 Coxeter group, and other subgroups.
Graphs
Symmetric orthographic projections of these 16 polytopes can be made in the D6, D5, D4, D3, A5, A3, Coxeter planes. Ak has [k+1] symmetry, Dk has [2(k-1)] symmetry. B6 is also included although only half of its [12] symmetry exists in these polytopes.
These 16 polytopes are each shown in these 7 symmetry planes, with vertices and edges drawn, and vertices colored by the number of overlapping vertices in each projective position.

Pemphredon is a genus of digger wasps (Spheciformes) from the family Crabronidae. The genus is common in the Holarctic, 12 species are represented in Europe. Several species are considered beneficial because of their specialization in aphids.
Features
The Pemphredon species are often small and black coloured and have some similarity with ants. They have a short, furrowed abdominal stem, two submarginal cells in the forewing and a well developed head, especially behind the compound eyes. The species identification is difficult.
Based on the course of the submarginal veins the genus is divided into three species groups, which some authors also regard as subgenera. These are the lugubris, morio and lethifer groups. In the former, the outer vein of the second submarginal cell meets the marginal cell noticeably below the middle and the second returning vein ends in the second submarginal cell, which is usually longer than wide. In the morio group, the outer vein meets the marginal cell in the middle and the second submarginal cell is wider than long. Another feature of this group is a small spike between the antennae. In the third group, the outer vein meets the marginal cell near the middle, but the second returning vein joins before or just below the second submarginal cell, which is usually the same length or longer than wide.
Lifestyle
The females usually build their nests in hollow or marrowy stems or branches. Some species also use abandoned feeding tunnels in the wood or build their nests in plant galls. If there is a lack of space, the cells lie in lines one behind the other, otherwise they are branched. Short side passages are often first filled with bore dust and only later developed into cells. Each cell is supplied with 10 to 60 aphididae, whereby the selection of the species is unspecific. The prey is either stunned with a sting or killed with the mandibles. Then they are grabbed with the mandibles and transported to the nest. When a cell is completely supplied, an egg is laid on the ground or in the middle of the cell between the prey animals. In many species, the larvae do not pupate in a complete cocoon, but in a cap over the head, which can be a thin membrane that merges into the wall of the brood cell. Some species such as Pemphredon lethifer also produce a fine second membrane just below the cap.
From the inner cells of the nest usually hatch females, from the outer males. The genus develops proterandric, which means that the males hatch a few days before the females. In Central Europe, one generation per year is developed, in favourable years it can be two. The imagines of many species feed on honeydew, but sometimes also on the aphids themselves. Parasitoids of the genus are reported to be from the cuckoo wasps, ichneumon flies, Gasteruptiidae and chalcidoid wasps.

Chen Wen-yu (; 20 November 1925 – 7 December 2012) was a Taiwanese botanist, horticulturist and an inventor in agriculture science. He bred new strains and varieties of plants, including fruits, flowers, and vegetables over his 70-year-long career. At the time of his death, one fourth of the watermelon seeds in the world were supplied by Chen. He developed over 280 varieties of new watermelon species including seedless watermelons, yellow skinned watermelons with red meat (called “Diana”), and baby watermelons. He became known as the “Watermelon King” because of his extensive work with watermelons. He established Known-You Seed Cooperation at 1968, also as director of Known-You Social Welfare Foundation since 1991.
Early life
Born when Taiwan was under Japanese rule and raised in a rural village in Tainan's Yongkang District, which is in southern Taiwan, Chen realized the hardships farmers experienced in his childhood. When he was 14, he decided that he would study agricultural technology to help improve farmers' lives. After graduating from an agricultural school, he worked with Dr. Tsuneo Eguchi (江口庸雄) in the FengShan Tropical Horticultural Experiment Branch of the Agricultural Research Institute, a department of the Council of Agriculture (COA) in Kaohsiung. During this time, he was inspired by Luther Burbank and Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, who were pioneers in agricultural science. Two years later, he served in the Japanese Army near the end of World War II. After the war, he returned to the FengShan Tropical Horticultural Experiment Branch again, and he worked on plant breeding research. Recalling memories of his father's poor crops and the seeds they came from, Chen devoted himself to the research and development of seeds better suited to Taiwan's climate and soil. This in turn led him to study cross-pollination techniques. With funding from the US Agency for International Development, he pursued advanced studies in horticulture at Chiba University in Japan. He later returned to Taiwan and founded the Kaohsiung-based Known-You Seed Co with his friends in 1968. The name “Known-You” can be transliterated as “friends of farmers” in Taiwanese.
Work
Chen's company focuses on developing new varieties of watermelon seeds, but has also created around 1,100 new vegetable and fruit varieties, with 600 of them going into mass production. So far over 90 percent of watermelon seeds sold to farmers in Taiwan are created by Chen. Due to the species improvement he has made, watermelons are cultivated on the island in the four seasons and in various kinds of soils.
Meanwhile, the US seed-testing organization All-America Selections, which is the oldest, most established international testing organization to promote new seed varieties in North America, rewarded a total seven awards for watermelons, four of which were from Known-You.
The company has a seedling farm in the US and branch offices in China, India and several Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Inspired by Chen Wen-yu's mentor, Dr. Tsuneo Eguchi who mentioned about helping farmers in southeastern Asia, Chen funded the establishment of a hospital ( Known-You Seed Farmers' Hospital) in Myanmar to provide free medical services for farmers there in 2001 and also set up a foundation to help improve local farmers' welfare.
Seedless watermelon
Chen Wen-yu was particularly interested in the theory of seedless watermelons proposed by the Japanese researcher Hitoshi Kihara in 1951, according to which crossing a female tetraploid plant (itself the product of genetic manipulation) with diploid pollen creates a triploid plant that is sterile, but can produce seedless fruit if pollenized by a diploid plant. Sound as the theory was, in practice none of the seed companies in Japan could successfully cultivate the seedless variety on a commercial scale. After incessant experimentation, in 1962 Chen succeeded in the first seedless watermelon in the world. The subsequent boom for Taiwan's seedless watermelons generated an annual export value of more than NT$100 million, and led to a new era of hybridity and crossbreeding in fruit and vegetables.
Hobbies
Chen Wen-yu started "Known-Yu News" in order to encourage his colleagues to enjoy writing and painting. By using a pen-name "A-Ying", Chen has written a column called as "A-Ying's Drawing and Saying (阿英的畫話)" over 30 years. Two books has been published by selecting the popular articles in his column.
Rewards
2003 Chen Wen-yu received the honor of the “National Agricultural Medal of Honor, 1st Grade" by Council of Agriculture.
2006 Chen Wen-yu was one of six Taiwanese icons on Discovery Channel TV shows "Portraits: Taiwan".
2010 Chen Wen-yu received APSA SPECIAL AWARD.
2011 Chen Wen-yu was conferred The Order of Brilliant Star with Violet Grand Cordon, by President Ma Ying-Jeou in recognition of his great contribution to national and social development.

The Jackson Creek (sometimes incorrectly spelled as Jacksons Creek) is a watercourse of the Port Phillip catchment, located in the outer northern suburbs of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria.
Location and features
Formed by the confluence of the Distill, Gisborne and Slaty creeks that drain the southern parts of the Macedon Ranges, part of the Great Dividing Range through the Black Forest, the Jackson Creek rises northwest of , within the Rosslynne Reservoir. The creek flows east, then south, then south by east, joined by two minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Deep Creek to form the Maribyrnong River west of Melbourne Airport. In its upper reaches the creek flows east in a broad shallow valley in the Bullengarook area, then enters the deeper, narrower valley that characterises the remainder of the watercourse. The creek flows through the town of Gisborne before turning generally southwards to flow through eventually to join with Deep Creek south of Bulla, where the two waterways form the Maribyrnong River. The deep and relatively narrow valley cut by the creek in its southward course through the surrounding basalt plains is particularly prominent at such places as Emu Bottom and the Organ Pipes National Park. The creek descends over its course.
The incised meanders of the Jackson Creek demonstrate the downcutting of the Newer Volcanics and have formed rapids and small falls, along with outcrops of columnar basalts and tessellated pavements, for example at the Organ Pipes National Park near the Calder Freeway, a prominent display of basaltic columns so named because they look like organ pipes. Upstream, a bluestone flour mill near the falls south of Sunbury harnessed the major drop in river levels.
Etymology
The creek was named after the early Colonial settlers William Jackson and his brother, Samuel, who named the township of Sunbury after Sunbury-on-Thames, in Surrey, England when it was established in 1857.
By inference, as Deep Creek has been called the east branch of the Maribyrnong River, Jackson Creek could be considered the west branch. The creek has also historically been called Saltwater River Western Branch, Gisborne Creek, Macedon River, Saltwater River, and Saltwater Creek.
Crossings
Named and other significant bridges and crossing points along Jackson Creek include but are not limited to the following:
Holden Bridge (early concrete beam bridge replacing an earlier ford on Bulla - Diggers Rest Road)
Jacksons Creek bridge (Sunbury, historic twin arch bluestone bridge, pedestrians only)
Sunbury railway viaduct (constructed 1859 for Bendigo Rail Line)

The Vietnamese government often groups the various provinces and municipalities into three regions: Northern Vietnam, Central Vietnam, and Southern Vietnam. These regions can be further subdivided into eight subregions: Northeast Vietnam, Northwest Vietnam, the Red River Delta, the North Central Coast, the South Central Coast, the Central Highlands, Southeast Vietnam, and the Mekong River Delta. These regions are not always used, and alternative classifications are possible. Other classifications used can be: Northern, Central, Southern, and Mekong.

George Edwin Haas (born May 26, 1935) is a former outfielder, coach, manager and scout in American Major League Baseball.
Haas spent 14 years as a skipper in the farm system of the Atlanta Braves and replaced Joe Torre as Atlanta's manager after the 1984 season. His 1985 Braves squad went 50–71 (.413). With the Braves in fifth place in the National League West Division and 22 games out of the lead, Haas was fired on August 26, 1985, and succeeded by interim pilot Bobby Wine.
In his playing days, the , Haas was an outfielder who batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He graduated from St. John High School in Paducah and signed his first professional contract with the Chicago Cubs. He made the Majors with the Cubs in 1957 and was traded to the Milwaukee Braves in the offseason. His MLB career consisted of 55 games (1957–1958; 1960) with those two clubs, batting .243 with one home run and 17 total hits. A broken ankle cost him the entire 1959 season.
Haas remained with the Braves after his minor league playing career ended, managing and coaching in the minor leagues (1965–73; 1978–84), and serving as a Major League coach (1974–77). After his brief MLB managerial career, he served as a special assignment scout for the Montreal Expos (1986–94) and Boston Red Sox (1995–2003).
He comes from a baseball family: his brother, Louis, was an infielder in the Braves' organization from 1959 to 1962; two sons, Matt and Danny, are former minor league players who currently scout for the Baltimore Orioles; cousins Phil and Gene Roof are former Major League players and coaches and longtime minor league managers; and another cousin, Paul Roof, pitched in the minor leagues.

Maximillian Oppenheimer (; 6 May 1902 – 26 March 1957), known as Max Ophüls (; ), was a German-French film director who worked in Germany (1931–1933), France (1933–1940 and 1950–1957), and the United States (1947–1950). He made nearly 30 films, the latter ones being especially notable: La Ronde (1950), Le Plaisir (1952), The Earrings of Madame de… (1953) and Lola Montès (1955). He was credited as Max Opuls on several of his American films, including The Reckless Moment, Caught, Letter from an Unknown Woman, and The Exile. The annual Filmfestival Max Ophüls Preis in Saarbrücken is named after him.
Life
Youth and early career
Max Ophüls was born in Saarbrücken, Germany, the son of Leopold Oppenheimer, a Jewish textile manufacturer and owner of several textile shops in Germany, and his wife Helene Oppenheimer (née Bamberger). He took the pseudonym Ophüls during the early part of his theatrical career so that, should he fail, it wouldn't embarrass his father.
Initially envisioning an acting career, he started as a stage actor in 1919 and played at the Aachen Theatre from 1921 to 1923. He then worked as a theater director, becoming the first director at the city theater of Dortmund. Ophüls moved into theatre production in 1924. He became creative director of the Burgtheater in Vienna in 1926. he turned to film production in 1929, when he became a dialogue director under Anatole Litvak at UFA in Berlin. He worked throughout Germany and directed his first film in 1931, the comedy short Dann schon lieber Lebertran (literally In This Case, Rather Cod-Liver Oil).
Of his early films, the most acclaimed is Liebelei (1933), which included a number of the characteristic elements for which he was to become known: luxurious sets, a feminist attitude, and a duel between a younger and an older man.
It was at the Burgtheater that Ophüls met the actress Hilde Wall. They were married in 1926.
Exile and post-war career
Predicting the Nazi ascendancy, Ophüls, a Jew, fled to France in 1933 after the Reichstag fire and became a French citizen in 1938. After the fall of France to Germany, he travelled through Switzerland and Italy. In July 1941, before leaving for the United States, he stayed in Portugal, in Estoril, at Casa Mar e Sol. Once in Hollywood, championed by director Preston Sturges, a longtime fan, he directed a number of distinguished films.
His first Hollywood film was the Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. vehicle, The Exile (1947). Ophüls' Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948), derived from a Stefan Zweig novella, is the most highly regarded of the American films. Caught (1949), and The Reckless Moment (1949) followed, before his return to Europe in 1950.
Back in France, he directed and collaborated on the adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde (1950), which won the 1951 BAFTA Award for Best Film, and Lola Montès (1955) starring Martine Carol and Peter Ustinov, as well as Le Plaisir and The Earrings of Madame de... (1953), the latter with Danielle Darrieux and Charles Boyer, which capped his career. Ophüls died from rheumatic heart disease on 26 March 1957 in Hamburg, while shooting interiors on The Lovers of Montparnasse, and was buried in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. This final film was completed by his friend Jacques Becker.
Ophüls's son Marcel Ophüls became a documentary-film maker, director of The Sorrow and the Pity and other films examining the nature of political power.
Style
All his works feature his distinctive smooth camera movements, complex crane and dolly sweeps, and tracking shots.
Many of his films inspired filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson, who gave an introduction on the restored DVD of The Earrings of Madame de... (1953).
Some of his films are narrated from the point of view of the female protagonist. Film scholars have analyzed films such as Liebelei (1933), Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948), and Madame de... (1953) as examples of the woman's film genre.
Nearly all of his female protagonists had names beginning with "L" (Leonora, Lisa, Lucia, Louise, Lola, etc.)
Actor James Mason, who worked with Ophüls on two films, wrote a short poem about the director's love for tracking shots and elaborate camera movements:
A shot that does not call for tracks
Is agony for poor dear Max,
Who, separated from his dolly,
Is wrapped in the deepest melancholy.
Once, when they took away his crane,
I thought he'd never smile again.
Filmography
Also worked on Les amants de Montparnasse (1958), before his death.

Malvik Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Malvik municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It is located in the village of Malvik. It is the church for the Malvik parish which is part of the Stjørdal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The white, wooden church was built in a cruciform style in 1846 by the architect G.O. Olsen. The church seats about 550 people.
History
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1432, but the church was not new at that time. The original church was likely a wooden stave church with a rectangular nave and a narrower chancel that may have been built during the 14th century. That church had a tower on the roof near the west end of the church. In 1654, the old church was torn down and replaced with a new church on the same site. This new timber-framed building was consecrated in 1656. In 1843, the church was inspected and it was found to be in poor shape, so it was decided to replace the church building. In 1846, the old church was torn down and a new wooden, cruciform church was built on the same site. The new building was consecrated on 18 November 1846 by the Bishop Hans Riddervold.

The Pennsylvania Railroad Station-Wilkinsburg is located in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, on Hay Street at the foot of Ross Avenue. The building was completed in 1916 when the railroad embankment through town was elevated above street level to eliminate hazardous grade crossings. The two previous stations had been located three blocks southeast along Wood Street between Franklin and Rebecca Avenues.
The 1916 station was built of brick and stone in the current Beaux-Arts architecture style with a vitrified tile waiting room and monumental wooden benches. It served three 12-car-length island platforms with enclosed seating areas situated between three pairs of tracks (main and yard leads). Originally the platform surfaces were level with the floors of the railroad passenger cars, but they were later lowered to the level of the track, reportedly due to substandard lateral clearances between the platforms and carbodies caused by the tracks' partially curved alignment when lengthier cars came into use; the change further spared train crews the inconvenience of having to lower and raise trap doors over the coach stairwells for this single station alone when platform levels of the other stations on this commuter route (possibly excepting East Liberty) were not elevated to match. One of the platforms was removed altogether. Access to the platforms was available by stairways at the Penn Avenue, South Avenue, and Franklin Avenue underpasses, in addition to the station tunnel which also served as the Ross Avenue pedestrian underpass. There was also a separate tunnel at the station to deliver mail, express, and baggage to the platforms (a U.S. post office was later constructed across the street from the station, forming a sort of civic center in conjunction with the municipal building/public library, also across the street). The station's strategic location visible down Ross Ave. was negated when that street's motor traffic was made one-way in the opposite direction.
Some time after demolition of the nearby East Liberty station in 1963, the Wilkinsburg station was designated to assume its function as the satellite station for selected long-distance express trains serving passengers in the East End of Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Railroad commuter trains at Wilkinsburg were discontinued on Nov. 27, 1964; some of the long-distance trains continued to provide a limited commuter service even into the Amtrak era. The building was sold to the Borough of Wilkinsburg on Aug. 21, 1967. Although there was no ticket agent in later years, the waiting room remained open to customers and foot traffic during normal business hours until the freight agent was withdrawn, and then was used for the Borough's public-works purposes. The PRR was merged into the Penn Central Transportation Company on Feb. 1, 1968. Its long-distance passenger service was assumed by Amtrak on May 1, 1971, at which time the three most lightly-patronized of the four pairs of trains still making daily stops at the station were discontinued. Long-distance passenger-train service at Wilkinsburg ended on September 14, 1975 when Amtrak discontinued the stop, citing a total of 128 passengers boarding or alighting in the first six months of 1975, the lowest system-wide, a far cry from the Borough's and railroad's heyday when the borough's status as a dense bedroom community and commercial draw for the eastern suburbs meant that nearly every local train passing through stopped there, apparently second in importance once again to only East Liberty.
The last train serving Wilkinsburg station was the National Limited, which operated daily between New York City and Kansas City, Missouri. By then, Wilkinsburg had a reputation as an unsafe neighborhood, and the stop was scheduled normally during darkness rather than in daylight. The right of way was conveyed to Consolidated Rail Corporation on April 1, 1976, then to Norfolk Southern Railway on June 1, 1999. During the brief resumption of commuter service with Conrail's Parkway Limited in 1981, the platforms had been removed and the stairways were inaccessible, so these two pairs of trains made their Wilkinsburg stop about two blocks southeast of the station, nearer the location of the predecessor stations; the building was not used. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 18, 1985.
Plans are underway for a $6.5 million renovation for Wilkinsburg station. Plans include a renovation of the existing site amenities and landscape, comprehensive restoration of the building's exterior, restoration of significant historic spaces on the main floor, renovation of the lower level, new restrooms, new site utilities (including water, sewer, gas, and electrical service), and new mechanical, electrical, plumbing and fire protection services (completed according to historic property standards).

Mycteropoidea is an extinct superfamily of eurypterids, an extinct group of chelicerate arthropods commonly known as "sea scorpions". It is one of four superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Stylonurina. Mycteropoids have been recovered from Europe, Russia, South America and South Africa. Mycteropoid specimens are often fragmentary, making it difficult to establish relationships between the included taxa. Only two mycteropoid taxa are known from reasonable complete remains, Hibbertopterus scouleri and H. wittebergensis.
Mycteropoids were large bizarre Eurypterids found from the Early Silurian to the end of the Permian period. They were sweep feeders, inhabiting freshwater swamps and rivers, feeding by raking through the soft sediment with blades on their anterior appendages to capture small invertebrates. Their morphology was so unusual that they have been thought to be an order separate to Eurypterida. Recent work however confirms them to be derived members of the suborder Stylonurina, with the genus Drepanopterus being a basal member of their superfamily.
The mycteropoids are important within eurypterid evolutionary history as the last group of eurypterids to experience a significant radiation in diversity at the genus level (during the Late Devonian and Carboniferous) as well as being the latest known surviving members of the group, going extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event.
Description
Mycteropoids are diagnosed as stylonurines with a posterior cleft on the metastoma and rounded lenses overlaying the lateral eyes as well as having anterior prosomal appendages modified for sweep-feeding.
Sweep-feeding strategies evolved independently in two of the four stylonurine superfamilies, the Stylonuroidea and the Mycteropoidea. In both superfamilies, the adaptations to this lifestyle involves modifications to the spines on their anterior prosomal appendages for raking through the substrate of their habitats. Stylonuroids have fixed spines on appendages II-IV which could have been used as dragnets to rake through the sediments and thus entangling anything in their way. Mycteropoids show even more extreme adaptations towards a sweep-feeding lifestyle.
They possess blades on prosomal appendages II-III (and IV within the Hibbertopteridae), highly distinct from flattened spines such as in the kokomopteroid Hallipterus, being laterally expanded with a blunt and rounded termination that has sensory setae. The tactile function of these might have allowed mycteropoids to select prey from the sediments in a way that stylonuroids could not.
In the mycteroptids, appendages II and III were used for prey capture, whilst hibbertopterids also used appendage IV, while also retaining its use as a leg for walking. The coxae in Hibbertopterus are reduced, leading to part of the food masticatory process being assumed by the laden (plates overlaying the coxae). Some species of Hibbertopterus have even further adaptations towards sweep-feeding than other mycteropoids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that some species of Hibbertopterus would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.
Systematics and genera
Mycteropoids are so derived and unusual that their unique morphology on occasion has prompted researchers to place them as an order separate to Eurypterida. Recent research however resolve them as a sister group to Kokomopteroidea, united by a median ridge on the carapace between the lateral eyes and a distal thickening to the podomeres of the prosomal appendages, within the Stylonurina suborder of eurypterids.
Drepanopterus, the only member of the family Drepanopteridae, was resolved as a sister taxon to all other mycteropoids and is also the earliest known member of the group, occurring from the Lower Silurian to the Upper Devonian. Drepanopterus also shares certain characteristics with the kokomopteroids (such as having a clavate telson) and other mycteropoids (a posteriorly cleft metastoma and having blades on the anterior prosomal appendages). Other mycteropoids are classified within one of two families, the Hibbertopteridae or the Mycteroptidae. The Hibbertopteridae and Mycteropidae are united by the possession of a hastate telson with paired ventral keels and a cuticular ornament consisting of scales or mucrones.
It is worth noting that it is thought that several genera within the Mycteropoidea may represent different ontogenic stages. Though further work is required to either confirm or disprove such hypotheses, one example is the suggestion that almost all the members of the Mycteroptidae (Megarachne, Mycterops and Woodwardopterus) might represent ontogenic stages of a single genus, Mycterops.

The Raleigh Strika was a children's bicycle manufactured between 1976 and 1983 by the Raleigh Bicycle Company of Nottingham, England. It was part of the Action Bikes range, smaller in size than the Grifter but larger than the Boxer, with frame dimensions designed to accommodate 6 to 10 year olds.
Design and styling
The frame styling of the Strika visually resembles a BMX although it was probably intended to resemble a motorbike. The most notable features are the imitation front suspension forks and the chunky padded saddle. The Strika was heavy compared to a similar size BMX and reputed to have ungainly handling qualities for stunt riding.
Early models of the Strika were fitted with a back pedal brake in addition to hand brakes. This feature was omitted from later models manufactured after approximately 1978. Known production colours are flame red, lime green, black, and silver.
In 1980 the Strika was complemented by the Strika XL which differed only by having a yellow frame and blue tyres, and a saddle identical to that later used on the Mini Burner.
Successors
The Strika was replaced by the Burner and Mini Burner in the 1980s although the Raleigh brochures from 1982 and 1983 show both the Strika and the Strika XL being sold alongside the Burner. In the late 1990s, Raleigh released the Dirt Cross with a frame styling and design similar to that of the Strika.

The Squaw Man (known as The White Man in the United Kingdom) is a 1914 American silent Western film directed by Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar C. Apfel, and starring Dustin Farnum. It was DeMille's directorial debut and one of the first feature films to be shot in what is now Hollywood.
Plot
James Wynnegate (Dustin Farnum) and his cousin, Henry (Monroe Salisbury), are upper class Englishmen and trustees for an orphans' fund. Henry loses money in a bet at a derby and embezzles money from “the fund” to pay off his debts. When war office officials are informed of the money missing they pursue James, but he successfully escapes to Wyoming. There, James rescues Nat-U-Ritch (Lillian St. Cyr), daughter to the chief of the Utes tribe, from local outlaw Cash Hawkins (William Elmer). Hawkins plans to exact his revenge on James, but has his plans thwarted by Nat-U-Ritch, who shoots him dead. Later, James has an accident in the mountains and needs to be rescued. Nat-U-Ritch discovers him and carries him back to safety. As she nurses him back to health, they fall in love and later have a child.
Meanwhile, during an exploration of the Alps, Henry falls off a cliff. Before he succumbs to his injuries, Henry signs a letter of confession proclaiming James's innocence in the embezzlement. Before Henry's widow, Lady Diana (Winifred Kingston) and others arrive in Wyoming to tell James about the news, the Sheriff recovers the murder weapon that was used against Cash Hawkins in James and Nat-U-Ritch's home. Realizing that their son is not safe, the couple sends him away, leaving them both distraught. Facing the possibilities of losing both her son and her freedom, Nat-U-Ritch decides to take her own life instead. The movie ends with both the chief of the Utes tribe and James embracing her body.

Production background
The only onscreen filmmaking credit is "Picturized by Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar C. Apfel." The film was adapted by DeMille and Apfel from the 1905 stage play of the same name by Edwin Milton Royle, and produced by DeMille, Apfel, and Jesse L. Lasky for the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, its first film.
This first screen version of the story was the legendary DeMille's first movie assignment. It was also the first feature-length film shot in California, partly in what became Hollywood. Film historians agree that shorts had previously been filmed in Hollywood, with D. W. Griffith's In Old California (1910) considered the earliest. DeMille rented what is now known as the Lasky-DeMille Barn at the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets to serve as their studio and production office; today it is home to the Hollywood Heritage Museum. Shooting on The Squaw Man began December 29, 1913, and finished January 20, 1914.
DeMille wanted to emphasize the outdoors and wanted to shoot the movie in exotic scenery and great vistas. Initially he traveled to Flagstaff, Arizona to film the movie. After seeing the vast amount of mountains near Flagstaff, the production was moved to Los Angeles. Harbor scenes were shot in San Pedro, California and the western saloon set was built beside railroad tracks in the San Fernando Valley. Footage of cattle on the open range was shot at Keen Camp near Idyllwild, California, while snow scenes were shot at Mount Palomar. Cecil B. DeMille felt that lighting in a movie was extremely important and viewed it as the visual and emotional foundation to build his image. He believed that lighting was to a film as “music is to an opera”.
The Squaw Man went on to become the only movie successfully filmed three times by the same director/producer, DeMille. He filmed a silent remake in 1918, and a talkie version in 1931. The Squaw Man was 74 minutes long and generated $244,700 in profit.
Characters
The main character James Wynnegate played by Dustin Farnum, was cast as the hero for the film. Farnum was a notable Broadway star and his wife in real life Winifred Kingston was also a well-known actress. She played the English love interest. Red Wing (real name Lillian St. Cyr) was born into the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska on the Winnebago Reservation, and she played the American Indian wife.
Controversies
Non-Native American actor Joseph Singleton played the role of Tabywana, Nat-U-Ritch's father. Lillian St. Cyr of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska was cast to play the role of Nat-U-Ritch, a member of the Ute tribe. She is also known as "Princess Redwing". St. Cyr along with her husband James Young Deer (of the Nanticoke people of Delaware) have been regarded one of the first "Native American power couple" in Hollywood along with Mona Darkfeather and her husband director Frank E. Montgomery. DeMille had selected Lillian St. Cyr but his first choice had been Mona Darkfeather who was not available.
During the early silent film era, films based on Native Americans were popular. The central theme of this film was miscegenation. In the state of California, anti-miscegenation laws existed until 1948; however, while African Americans couldn't legally marry whites in California during filming, marriages between Native Americans and whites were permitted. Though there were Native American actors, whites were mostly cast as Indian characters.
During the early teens, Young Deer and his wife Lillian St. Cyr helped to transform how Native American characters were represented. The characters they created were sympathetic in complex ways, although other studios like Kalem were also attempting to accurately portray Natives in film. However, other scholars argue that Native American-themed silent films did not alter in any way the dominant perception of Indians themselves. Apparently, many films displayed the Native American experience from many different perspectives and did involve Native American writers, filmmakers, and actors during this time period.

Zwicken is an old Austrian and German card game for 4 to 6 players, which is usually played for small stakes and makes a good party game. It is one of the Rams group of card games characterised by allowing players to drop out of the current game if they think they will be unable to win any tricks or a minimum number of tricks.
History
Zwicken is an old game, first recorded in Austria in 1783 in Salzburg as a game of chance. The game was banned in Upper Austria in the late 1780s and in Styria and Bohemia in the 90s. This ban was extended to the whole of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by 1807. Nevertheless it continued to be played and its rules published during the course of the 19th century. In 19th-century Bavaria it was nicknamed Hombeschen [sic] after state minister von Hompesch introduced financial reforms that saw many pensions withdrawn or cut back.
Cards
Zwicken is played with 32 cards of a William Tell pack (especially in Austria) or a Piquet pack. The suits are illustrated in the table below. Card ranking is: Sow/Ace > King > Ober/Queen > Unter/Jack > Ten > Nine > Eight > Seven. However, as the permanent, second highest trump – the 7/7 – outranks all cards except for the Trump Sow.
Description
Zwicken is a very common Austrian and German gambling game that is usually played for small stakes and makes a good party game. It is like a more intense version of the German game of Tippen – the general rules and mode of play are much the same – but there are significant differences, especially its permanent trump, the 7, and its 'hop and jump' (Hupf und Sprung) element, in which, like Kratzen and Austrian Lampeln, the role of dealer may 'hop' to the next player or 'jump' over one or more players as a result of the cut. As in all games of the Rams group, players may always drop out of a particular deal at the start.
The main differences from Tippen are outlined below and are based on Katira, except where stated.
Permanent Trump. 7 / 7 is the permanent, 2nd-highest trump, ranking just below the Trump Ace / Sow.
Hop and Jump. Between shuffling and dealing, the player sitting to the right of the dealer (rearhand) cuts the cards and reveals the lowest card. If it is an Ace / Sow or Seven, the deal passes to the next player without playing, but the dealer's stake remains in the pool and the next dealer also pays 3 units . If it is the 7 / 7, the deal passes to the rearhand in clockwise order and both he and all the players in between pay the basic stake of 3 units.
Trump Ace. The player with the Trump Ace / Sow, must play it the first time he is leading to a trick.
Play
The aim is to win as many tricks as possible. After the dealer has been decided, taking account of any 'hop' or 'jump' as described above, he antes 3 chips to the pot and deals 2 cards to each player, turns the next for trumps and then deals a third card to each player. At this point, beginning with forehand, players may exchange up to 3 cards with the talon or announce that they will "pass" and drop out of the current deal. Forehand leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible, otherwise must trump and must head the trick if they can. The winner is the player with the most tricks.
Scoring
Players earn a third of the pot for each trick taken. In addition a player is gezwickt (i.e. has lost) and pays a basic stake if:
he plays and fails to take a trick
as the dealer, he fails to check the lowest card
he has the Trump Ace and does not lead it to a trick at the first opportunity
he has the 7 / 7 and loses it to the Trump Ace.
Anbieten, Freibieten and Sticheln
An historical variant of Zwicken was played in which only the last trick counted. This was variously known as Anbieten, Freibieten or Sticheln, and was banned, for example, in Upper Austria as in 1825 because it was "very similar to the forbidden card game of Zwicken and belongs to those games in which winning and losing depend more on the luck of the cards than on the skill of the player" and "because the stake could be increased time and again by the declarer" (Freibieter). It was probably also played in Bavaria as it is mentioned in the Bavarian Dictionary in 1836.
This variant should not be confused with Sticheln, another Austrian game which resembles Whist.

SeaWorld San Antonio is a marine mammal park, oceanarium and animal theme park in the Westover Hills District of San Antonio, Texas, on the city's west side. It is the largest of the three parks in the SeaWorld chain owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment and one of the world's largest marine-life theme parks focused on conservation, education and animal rescue. It is a member of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
History
The park, initially called Sea World of Texas, was developed by Harcourt, Brace and Jovanovich (now Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). Built for $170 million, it opened on May 27, 1988 and 75,000 people attended the opening. It had 3.3 million visitors in its first 12 months of operation, placing it among the Top 10 attractions in Texas. At the time of its debut, it was billed as "the largest educational, marine-life theme park in the world."
In 1989, Harcourt, Brace and Jovanovich (heavy in debt and fighting a hostile takeover) sold its SeaWorld and Boardwalk and Baseball theme parks to Anheuser-Busch, Inc. Plans to build a second Boardwalk and Baseball park adjacent to Sea World San Antonio were abandoned.
On November 26, 1988, Kayla (stage named "Baby Shamu") was the first killer whale born at the park. At the time of her death on January 28, 2019, she resided at SeaWorld Orlando.
Under Anheuser-Busch ownership, the park closed less popular attractions consisting of the Texas Walk, Cypress Gardens West, Joplin Square, U.S. Map Plaza, and the Garden of Flags and added its Budweiser Clydesdales to the park.
In 2008, Anheuser-Busch merged with InBev; soon after, the newly merged company sold the SeaWorld parks to Blackstone Group.
In March 2016, SeaWorld Entertainment announced that the current generation of killer whales at it parks would be the last. SeaWorld San Antonio currently houses 5 killer whales. It was also announced that the theatrical killer whale shows would be phased out and replaced with more naturalistic Orca Encounters. SeaWorld San Antonio's Orca Encounter opened on February 22, 2020.
From 14 March to 18 June 2020, in line with other SeaWorld parks, the park was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Killer whales
SeaWorld's killer whales are housed in Shamu Theater, most of which were born at SeaWorld except Kyuquot who was born at the defunct Sealand of the Pacific in Canada. There are currently 5 killer whales, Takara (F, Matriarch), Sakari (F), Kamea (F), Tuar (M), and Kyuquot (M).
Beluga whales
SeaWorld San Antonio has one of the most prolific beluga breeding programs in any zoological facility in the United States. Half of the belugas currently at the facility were born at the park and several belugas at other US facilities were originally born here.
This park has also been selected the permanent home of a rescued Cook Inlet beluga named Tyonek who was deemed unreleasable due to his young age and lack of survival skills. They were chosen due to their diverse beluga population of experienced mothers and younger belugas close to his age, but surprisingly he ended up bonding with Betty, one of the park's Pacific white-sided dolphins.
As of 2022, SeaWorld San Antonio has 10 belugas.
Dolphins
SeaWorld has 18 bottlenose dolphins that live in 2 different areas of the park. Discovery Point is where most of the park's female dolphins live, where they do interaction programs and are also on display via above water and underwater viewing areas. Zoological Support is a backstage area where all of the park's male dolphins live and where other animals could go for breeding purposes, specialized veterinary care, etc. While most dolphins were born within the SeaWorld parks except Notchfin, 4 of these dolphins are also rescued dolphins that were deemed nonreleasable by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
They also have 6 Pacific white-sided dolphins that live at Beluga Stadium. SeaWorld San Antonio is one of three zoological facilities in the United States that cares for Pacific white-sided dolphins.
Sea Lions, Seals, and Otters
In addition to the performing sea lions and otters, there is a large population of California sea lions and harbor seals living at this open air exhibit. Pinniped feeding opportunities are available for an additional fee. Unique to this SeaWorld is an exhibit for the park's Asian small-clawed and African spot-necked otters, while the other parks' freshwater otters can only be seen during shows.
Sea Turtles
The newest animal exhibit in the park which opened in May 2019 featuring rescued loggerhead and green sea turtles that live with schools of marine fish. It also has a natural biofiltration system consisting of an adjacent salt marsh with bacteria in the plant roots that feed on animal waste.
Aquatica San Antonio
Aquatica is a water park that was formerly a section of the park under the name, Lost Lagoon, which opened in 1993 and closed on September 5, 2011 to be replaced by Aquatica San Antonio, a separate gated water park based on the original Aquatica Orlando. The new park opened on Memorial Day weekend May 2012.

On 3 December 2021, the defending world champion Magnus Carlsen (as White) defeated the challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi in the sixth game of the World Chess Championship 2021 in 136 moves, which made it the longest game in the history of the World Chess Championship. The game was played in 7 hours and 45 minutes, finishing after midnight local time, to take Carlsen to a 3½–2½ lead in the best-of-14-game match.
It was the first classical game in a World Chess Championship in more than five years that did not end in a draw; after Magnus Carlsen won the tenth game of the World Chess Championship 2016 against Sergey Karjakin to level the score, there was the longest-ever streak of 19 draws in consecutive World Chess Championship classical games (games 11–12 in 2016, games 1–12 in 2018, games 1–5 in 2021). The game was widely praised, with chess players and commentators describing it as "epic" and an "all-time classic".
The game proved to be the turning point in the match. After it, Nepomniachtchi's play declined significantly from being on par with Carlsen to highly error-prone, with Carlsen ultimately retaining his title by 7½–3½.
Background
By winning the Candidates Tournament 2020–21, Ian Nepomniachtchi earned the right to challenge the defending world champion Magnus Carlsen in the World Chess Championship 2021, which was held during Expo 2020 at Dubai Exhibition Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, between 24 November and 10 December 2021. For the first time, Carlsen was challenged for the title by a player with a positive head-to-head record in classical games against him (4–1 with eight draws) before the start of the match.
The first five games of the match all ended in draws. Early in the match, some commentators thought that both players were too good to lose a game.
The game
White: Magnus Carlsen Black: Ian Nepomniachtchi Tournament: World Chess Championship 2021 Opening: Queen's Pawn Game, Symmetrical Variation, Pseudo-Catalan (ECO D02)
1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. g3
With this move order, White aims for a Catalan-like setup, except the move c4 is delayed.
3... e6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. b3
White's point is to side-step the main line with 6. c4, which was played in the second game of the match.
6... c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. c4 dxc4 9. Qc2
This move, pinning the pawn c4, delays re-capturing on c4 and avoids a queen exchange.
9... Qe7 10. Nbd2!? Nc6!
White wants to sacrifice a pawn, but Black does not accept and goes for rapid development.
11. Nxc4 b5 12. Nce5 Nb4 13. Qb2 Bb7 14. a3 Nc6 15. Nd3 Bb6 16. Bg5 Rfd8 17. Bxf6 gxf6
Black avoids a queen exchange even though that would be fine. In a resulting endgame, White could claim a "good" knight on d3 versus a potentially "bad" bishop, but the black pieces are active and the bishop on b6 would be nicely placed.
18. Rac1 Nd4 19. Nxd4 Bxd4 20. Qa2 Bxg2 21. Kxg2 Qb7+ 22. Kg1 Qe4 23. Qc2 a5 24. Rfd1 Kg7 25. Rd2
A more ambitious move was 25. e3 because the bishop does not have a comfortable retreating square and 25...Be5 26. Qe2 Bd6 27. Nc5! gives White a risk-free option to press.
25... Rac8 26. Qxc8 Rxc8 27. Rxc8 Qd5 28. b4 a4 29. e3 Be5?!
Black could have gone for an easy draw with 29...Bb2.
30. h4 h5 31. Kh2 Bb2?
Now the idea of putting the bishop on b2, which was a bail-out option for Black a couple of moves ago, suddenly loses.
32. Rc5 Qd6 33. Rd1?
In the time pressure, Carlsen does not exploit the winning chance, which was hard to spot and calculate, and goes for a continuation which gives up a pawn.
33... Bxa3 34. Rxb5 Qd7 35. Rc5 e5 36. Rc2? (diagram) Qd5?
Black had a couple of opportunities to capture the hanging b4-pawn before White connected his rooks.
37. Rdd2 Qb3 38. Ra2 e4 39. Nc5 Qxb4 40. Nxe4?
Carlsen managed to survive the time trouble and get a promising position; however, 40. Rdc2!! would have won the a4-pawn and resulted in a winning endgame.
40... Qb3 41. Rac2 Bf8 42. Nc5 Qb5 43. Nd3 a3 44. Nf4 Qa5 45. Ra2 Bb4 46. Rd3 Kh6 47. Rd1 Qa4 48. Rda1 Bd6 49. Kg1 Qb3 50. Ne2 Qd3 51. Nd4 Kh7 52. Kh2 Qe4?!
Black chooses to give up his a-pawn for White's h-pawn, which will give him a difficult position to defend.
53. Rxa3 Qxh4+ 54. Kg1 Qe4 55. Ra4 Be5 56. Ne2 Qc2 57. R1a2 Qb3 58. Kg2 Qd5+ 59. f3
This move weakens the e3-pawn and gives Black an opportunity to tie White's pieces to defending it.
59... Qd1 60. f4 Bc7 61. Kf2 Bb6 62. Ra1 Qb3 63. Re4 Kg7 64. Re8 f5 65. Raa8 Qb4 66. Rac8 Ba5 67. Rc1 Bb6 68. Re5 Qb3 69. Re8 Qd5 70. Rcc8 Qh1 71. Rc1 Qd5 72. Rb1 Ba7 73. Re7 Bc5 74. Re5 Qd3 75. Rb7 Qc2 76. Rb5 Ba7 77. Ra5 Bb6 78. Rab5 Ba7 79. Rxf5 Qd3 80. Rxf7+ Kxf7 81. Rb7+ Kg6 82. Rxa7
The arising position gives White the opportunity to steadily press for a victory without any risk and is very unpleasant for Black, although holdable with perfect defence. Nepomniachtchi manages to prevent further White progress for 28 moves.
82... Qd5 83. Ra6+ Kh7 84. Ra1 Kg6 85. Nd4 Qb7 86. Ra2 Qh1 87. Ra6+ Kf7 88. Nf3 Qb1 89. Rd6 Kg7 90. Rd5 Qa2+ 91. Rd2 Qb1 92. Re2 Qb6 93. Rc2 Qb1 94. Nd4 Qh1 95. Rc7+ Kf6 96. Rc6+ Kf7 97. Nf3 Qb1 98. Ng5+ Kg7 99. Ne6+ Kf7 100. Nd4 Qh1 101. Rc7+ Kf6 102. Nf3 Qb1 103. Rd7 Qb2+ 104. Rd2 Qb1 105. Ng1 Qb4 106. Rd1 Qb3 107. Rd6+ Kg7 108. Rd4 Qb2+ 109. Ne2 Qb1
Finally, with the Ne2 and the Rd4 protecting the King well, White can make progress again by pushing the e-pawn.
110. e4 Qh1 111. Rd7+ Kg8 112. Rd4 Qh2+ 113. Ke3 h4 114. gxh4 Qh3+ 115. Kd2 Qxh4 116. Rd3 Kf8 117. Rf3 Qd8+ 118. Ke3
Carlsen said it was important to bring the knight to g3.
118... Qa5 119. Kf2 Qa7+ 120. Re3
The recent developments give some hopes for White because putting his knight on g3 and king on f3 allow him to push his connected pawns forward.
120... Qd7 121. Ng3 Qd2+ 122. Kf3 Qd1+ 123. Re2 Qb3+ 124. Kg2 Qb7 125. Rd2 Qb3 126. Rd5 Ke7 127. Re5+ Kf7 128. Rf5+ Ke8 129. e5 Qa2+ 130. Kh3 Qe6? (diagram)
This was the losing move according to the endgame tablebases. The queen should have remained behind the pawns in order to hold the position (130...Qc2 or 130...Qb1 was still holding). Now all the White pieces move forward in a coordinated and decisive way.
131. Kh4 Qh6+ 132. Nh5 Qh7 133. e6!
The rook cannot be taken because of the royal fork with Ng7+.
133... Qg6 134. Rf7 Kd8 135. f5 Qg1 136. Ng7 1–0
After 136. Ng7, Black could have prolonged the game with series of checks, but White's king would have found refuge on g8. With White's pawns close to promotion at the far end of the board, Black resigned after 136 moves.
Computer analysis
Once Black captured White's h-pawn in the 115th move, only seven pieces remained on the board, and the game could be found in endgame tablebases as a theoretical draw. However, it does not mean that the draw is easily achievable for a human. Nepomniachtchi had to carefully find the right moves in order to hold the draw, while Carlsen was playing essentially without any risk. Nepomniachtchi made the decisive mistake with 130... Qe6?, which leads to a forced mate in 60 according to the computer analysis.
Records
With the win, Carlsen took a 3½–2½ lead in the best-of-14-game match. It was the first classical game in a World Chess Championship in over five years that did not end in a draw; after Carlsen won the tenth game of the World Chess Championship 2016 against Sergey Karjakin to level the score, there was the longest-ever streak of 19 draws in consecutive World Chess Championship classical games (games 11–12 in 2016, games 1–12 in 2018, games 1–5 in 2021).
The game lasted for seven hours and forty-five minutes. After Nepomniachtchi resigned following Carlsen's 136th move, it became the longest game in the 135-year history of the World Chess Championship. The previous record for the longest game had been game 5 of the World Chess Championship 1978 played between Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov, which was a 124-move draw. The longest decisive game up to that point had been game 16 of the World Chess Championship 1990, where Garry Kasparov defeated Karpov in 102 moves.
Reactions
The players discussed the game immediately after its finish and seemingly agreed that the objective result should have been a draw. In the press conference after the game, Carlsen compared it with the tenth game of the World Chess Championship 2016 which he won against Sergey Karjakin and said: "Obviously I'm elated to get this result. It was never easy. Frankly it shouldn't be. There were a lot of the same emotions as the game that I won against Karjakin (in Game 10 of the 2016 world championship), which was a marathon there as well. Obviously this is huge." Nepomniachtchi said that he felt it was reasonable to play for more than a draw in the game but admitted that the move 52...Qe4 was unnecessary. On the result, he added: "Anyway I would say that Magnus managed to capitalise on the very few chances he got. He got this game so that's very nice for him."
Former world champion Garry Kasparov praised the game and saw it as refuting the stereotypes that "chess isn't a sport" or "that physical condition isn't so important", as well as that "classical chess is dead". Former world champion challenger Nigel Short described the game as "epic" and called Carlsen's effort in the game "stupendous". His opinion was shared by chess historian Olimpiu G. Urcan, who added that the game itself was longer than all seven episodes of Netflix's mini-series The Queen's Gambit. The New York Times called game 6 "the breakthrough that blew open the contest" and "an epic struggle that rewrote the chess record books." The Guardian called the game "a heart-pounding psychodrama worthy of the sprawling canvas only the classical format can provide."
Impact and aftermath
Game 6 ended up being the turning point in the match. Nepomniachtchi had played solidly with five draws in the first five games; however, after his game 6 loss, he made blunders in three of the remaining games and eventually lost the match, 7½–3½. FiveThirtyEight mentioned that it was "the most lopsided championship in recent memory", while calling game 6 an "instant classic".
After taking the lead in the match as a result of his win in game 6, Carlsen went on to win the eighth game of the match, the next one he played as White, as Nepomniachtchi blundered a pawn with 21...b5?? and ended up in a desperate position. Following the game, Carlsen called on the sixth game to explain his opponent's blunder and said: "To be honest, this second win probably doesn't come without the first, so everything is kind of connected."
The match continued one-sidedly as Carlsen followed up with two other wins in the ninth and eleventh games, both of which he played as Black, again capitalising on an opponent's blunder in each of them. After Carlsen's third win in game 9, former world champion Viswanathan Anand noted that "in the first five games, Ian was able to match up to this and cope pretty well... but in game six it seemed that psychologically he collapsed first, and Magnus has been rampaging after that." Ultimately, Carlsen won the match by a final score of 7½–3½, winning four games, drawing seven and losing none, to claim his fifth World Chess Championship title.
The New Yorker praised Carlsen's play: "Watching [Carlsen] in this World Championship, though, he struck me as more superhuman than ever, not only for his vision over the board but for his mental stamina. Game 6 had been as even as possible, and yet he had turned it into a series of cascading advantages. As Carlsen made steady, calculated moves, Nepomniachtchi seemed to unravel." In an interview immediately after retaining the title, Carlsen said: "But we really shouldn't forget the fact that this match really, really turned on the sixth game."

William Hannon (1879–1950) was a Catholic priest from the United States who served as the fourth president of St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa from 1915 to 1926.
Hannon was born March 21, 1879 in Holbrook, Iowa. He graduated from St. Ambrose College in 1901 and studied for the priesthood at Kenrick Seminary near St. Louis, Missouri. He was ordained a priest in St. Louis in June 1903.
He was assigned to the faculty of St. Ambrose and taught English and history at the school from 1904 until 1912. He was named vice president, a position in which he served until 1915 when he took over the presidency. Hannon led the first endowment drive which raised $600,000 and oversaw the construction of the first gymnasium. Construction of Davis Hall was also begun when Hannon was president. Up to this time Ambrose Hall was the only building at St. Ambrose. He also updated the faculty and the curriculum. Each year he sent one or two of the priests on the faculty to a university to earn graduate degrees. He also increased the faculty's salaries to make the positions more attractive. The president's salary was raised to $1,000 a year, and the priests on the faculty were paid $300 a year and after 15 years they were paid $800 a year.
After his term as president ended in 1926 Hannon was named the pastor of St. Mathias Church in Muscatine, Iowa. In 1935 Pope Pius XI named him a Domestic Prelate upon the nomination of Bishop Henry Rohlman. Msgr. Hannon served as chairman of the diocesan building commission under Bishop Ralph Hayes. He died in 1950 at the age of 71.

Abraham Hall, constructed in 1889, is located on the northeast side of Old Muirkirk Road in the center of the historic African American community of Rossville, a section of Prince George's County, Maryland near Beltsville.
It was constructed by the Benevolent Sons and Daughters of Abraham, an African American society that was established for the social welfare of its members. Originally known as Rebecca Lodge #6 of the Benevolent Sons and Daughters of Abraham, the building was constructed by John W. Jackson in 1889 in the burgeoning community of Rossville. Abraham Hall, an excellent example of a multi-purpose building associated with African Americans, served as a meeting hall, a house of worship, a school, and a social hall for African Americans living in a segregated society. The lodge hall functioned as the community black school, until a Rosenwald School was built in 1922.
The structure is set back from the road on a grassy lot with mature trees. It is a three-bay, two-story gable front frame lodge building with a brick foundation, wood lap siding with cornerboards, and a shake roof with a boxed cornice. A brick chimney rises from the northwest slope of the roof. Both the interior and exterior of the building were carefully restored between 1986 and 1991 using original materials or in-kind replacements.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Monotoca glauca, known as goldy wood, is a heath family shrub endemic to Tasmania, Australia and is one of 17 described Monotoca species. It is a widespread and abundant understory species found on the margins of wet eucalypt forests and logged areas.
Description
Monotoca glauca is an evergreen, densely branched shrub or small tree with slender branches, often 2–3 m tall. Leaves are similar to Cyathodes glauca, however are not in whorls. Venation tends to be spreading or palmate, characteristic of the genus. Leaves are elliptic with a point, and are usually 1.5 cm long, with a yellowish-green, glabrous adaxial surface, and glaucous abaxial surface. Flowers are pentamerous, white and solitary in auxiliary spikes. M. glauca is usually hermaphroditic or sometimes unisexual by abortion of pollen or ovules. The corolla tube is short with spreading lobes. Flowering occurs in January and February. Fruit is an ovoid drupe, green when mature and 3mm in diameter.
Monotoca elliptica is superficially very similar, but can be distinguished by its terminal spikes, and its leaves tend to be wider and less linear.
Distribution and ecology
Monotoca glauca is a common understory shrub at the edges of wet eucalypt forests, mixed forest, buttongrass moorlands and in logged areas, found more commonly west of Tyler's Line.
Monotoca glauca is hardy to most frosts and light snowfalls, and tolerates moist, shady sites, and is susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi. It is phosphorus intolerant, but may be found on fertile, loam, poor and well drained soils.
Etymology
Monotoca glauca was first formally described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardière who gave it the name Styphelia glauca. It was renamed by English botanist George Claridge Druce who gave it its current binomial name in 1917.
"Glauca" comes from the Greek word glaukos meaning “gleaming, silvery”. In botanical terms, glaucous refers to the greyish, bluish or whitish waxy coating or bloom that is easily rubbed off.
Cultivation
Monotoca glauca is an ideal hedging plant, and may be grown from cuttings or seed but requires good drainage and part to full sun. Monotoca species are particularly difficult to germinate from seeds, and the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens seedbank has been making a concerted effort to resolve germination requirements.

Newton County is a county in the U.S. state of Arkansas. As of the 2010 census, the population was 8,330. The county seat is Jasper. Newton County is Arkansas's 46th county, formed on December 14, 1842, and named for Thomas W. Newton, an Arkansas Congressman. It is an alcohol prohibition or dry county.
Newton County is part of the Harrison, AR Micropolitan Statistical Area.
History
Newton County residents were divided during the Civil War, serving in both the Confederate and Union armies. John Cecil, who had served as Newton County's sheriff, served as a Confederate Captain. Jasper blacksmith James R. Vanderpool (ca. 1832–1880) served as Captain of Union Company C, 1st Regiment Arkansas Infantry Volunteers, while farmer and teacher John McCoy (1820–1903) served as Captain of Union Company F, 1st Regiment Arkansas Infantry Volunteers. Many Newton County citizens served under each of these men, as well as in other units. As an example of how the war divided families, Confederate Captain Cecil's brother, Sam, served as a sergeant in Union Company D, 2nd Regiment Arkansas Cavalry Volunteers. Violence took a severe toll on the civilian population, and at one point, Captains McCoy and Vanderpool escorted 20 wagons of Unionist families from Newton County to Missouri to seek refuge.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.
Newton County lies almost entirely within the rugged Boston Mountain range of the Ozark Mountains where elevations exceed . The Buffalo National River, a popular destination for canoeing and recreation, runs through the county from west to east. Highway 7, which traverses the county from north to south, has been rated as one of the most scenic drives in the region.

Results are discussed in two of her published articles/chapters: "The Morphology of Newton County, Arkansas: An Exercise in Studying Ozark Dialect," Mid–South Folklore 3 (1975), 115–125, and "Southern Mountain English" Chapter 5 of The Workings of Language, ed. R. S. Wheeler, Westport, CT, and London: Praeger, 1999, 67–79.
Government
The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Arkansas and the Arkansas Code. The quorum court is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are called justices of the peace and are elected from county districts every even-numbered year. The number of districts in a county vary from nine to fifteen, and district boundaries are drawn by the county election commission. The Newton County Quorum Court has nine members. Presiding over quorum court meetings is the county judge, who serves as the chief operating officer of the county. The county judge is elected at-large and does not vote in quorum court business, although capable of vetoing quorum court decisions.
Politics
Along with adjacent Searcy County, Newton is unique among Arkansas counties in being traditionally Republican in political leanings even during the overwhelmingly Democratic "Solid South" era. This Republicanism resulted from their historical paucity of slaves, in turn created by infertile soils unsuitable for intensive cotton farming, and produced support for the Union during the Civil War. These were the only two counties in Arkansas to be won by Alf Landon in 1936, Wendell Willkie in 1940, Charles Evans Hughes in 1916, and even Calvin Coolidge in 1924. Since the Civil War the only Democrats to gain an absolute majority of Newton County's vote have been Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and Jimmy Carter in 1976. In 2008, the Socialism and Liberation candidate, Gloria La Riva, had the notable achievement of winning the precinct of Murray, ahead of major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. The Republican nominee has received over sixty percent in all Presidential elections from 2000 to 2020 inclusive. In 2016, Newton County voted over 76 percent for Donald Trump, while Hillary Clinton received just 18 percent.
The county is in Arkansas's 1st congressional district, which from Reconstruction until 2010 sent only Democrats to the U.S. House. That year, it elected Republican Rick Crawford, who currently holds the seat as of 2021. In the Arkansas House of Representatives Newton County is represented by second-term Republican David Branscum from the 83rd (and formerly the 90th prior to 2013) district.
The state senator, Missy Thomas Irvin, is also a Republican, serving her second term from the 18th district.

London Waterloo International station was the London terminus of the Eurostar international rail service from its opening on 14 November 1994 to its closure on 13 November 2007, when it was replaced by London St Pancras International as the terminal for international rail services. It was on the western side of London Waterloo mainline station but was managed and branded separately.
In August 2017, the buildings and platforms were reopened for one month while platforms within the main station were rebuilt. After a period of redevelopment, platforms 20–22 reopened as part of the main station in December 2018, followed by platforms 23 and 24 in May 2019.
History
The station was designed by Grimshaw Architects with Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners appointed consultant engineers. In October 1990, Bovis Construction was awarded the construction contract. It was completed in May 1993, in time for the scheduled completion of the Channel Tunnel. Construction of the tunnel was delayed however, and the station did not open until November 1994, when it won the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture as well as the Royal Institute of British Architects' Building of the Year Award.
Waterloo International had five platforms, numbered 20 to 24, one (20) taken from the mainline station, and four new ones. Unlike the platforms at the main station, they were long enough to accommodate trains of up to 20 coaches (total length 394 metres). The platforms were all covered by a 400 m long glass and steel vault of 36 arches forming a prismatic structure, conceived by Anthony Hunt Associates. The five vaults are supported by a grid of cylindrical concrete columns that rise up from the carpark level, through the circulation levels to the platforms. A structural glass wall separated the existing Waterloo station from the International station.
A two-level reception area fronted the main station concourse. The curvature of the roof is steeper on the western side and here the trains passed close to the structure. The roof arches are made up of two dissimilar curved trusses, triangular in section, with compression booms of tubular steel (CFS) and tension booms of solid steel. Both compression and tension members are curved – structural engineer Anthony Hunt described the trusses as "banana shaped". Curved, tapering trusses were later used to great effect at Kirklees Stadium in Huddersfield.
The first Eurostar departure, on 14 November 1994 and the last service left on 13 November 2007. From the next day Eurostar services used their new London terminus of St Pancras International.
Post-Eurostar
Ownership of Waterloo International station passed from London & Continental Railways to BRB (Residuary) Limited, with no clear plans for the future use of the Eurostar platforms. Some reports had suggested that they might be used for shops, but a parliamentary written answer of 4 June 2008 stated platform 20 was to be used by some South West Trains services from December 2008. At the time of closure, Network Rail had no immediate plans to use the other four former international platforms for domestic use and they were disused from November 2007.
From 4 July 2010 to 2 January 2011 two of the disused platforms hosted theatrical performances of Edith Nesbit's The Railway Children. The audience was seated either side of the actual railway track. The show includes the use of a steam engine, coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970 film being shunted in and out of the theatre area as required by a Class 08 shunter.
All the former international platforms were temporarily used for regional services during the refurbishment of the main station from Christmas 2013. Platform 20 came back into regular use for timetabled services in May 2014.
In March 2016, it was announced that the platforms and terminal building were to be incorporated into the main station as part of a £800 million refurbishment. In August 2017, the platforms were used temporarily while other platforms were upgraded, and after a further period of closure for redevelopment, they were permanently brought back into use in December 2018 (20, 21 and 22) and May 2019 (23 and 24). The terminal building will house a shopping mall.

She already played piano, but picked up her first trumpet by accident at age nine because it was the only available instrument which she recognized in her teacher's list for school band classes. She began playing traditional jazz trumpet as a schoolgirl and went on to earn degrees in jazz studies at Ithaca College in New York state and in jazz trumpet performance at the New England Conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts.
Career
Bradley released her debut album Just a Little Bit on her own label in 2007. In 2009, she signed with Les Cutmore's Trippin' N' Rhythm Records and recorded her second, Bloom, with Grammy Award-winning producer Michael Broening at his studio in Phoenix, Arizona. Bloom won instant critical acclaim and Bradley followed it in 2011 with Unscripted. The hit single from that album, "Massive Transit", co-written by Bradley and Broening, remained at No. 1 on the US Billboard Smooth Jazz Songs chart for six weeks. Unscripted itself topped the Billboard Jazz Albums chart for two weeks.
Bradley cites her major influences in jazz as fellow trumpet players Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and Blue Mitchell. When she is not touring or playing at jazz festivals, she works as a public elementary school band teacher in New Jersey. Cindy is a longtime vegan and animal rights advocate.
Bradley's sixth solo album, The Little Things, was released in May 2019.

SynfiniWay was middleware with which a virtualised IT framework can be created that provides a uniform and global view of resources within a department, a company, or a company with its suppliers. This virtualised IT framework is service-oriented, meaning that applications are run as services, which are a system-independent view of applications. Several applications can be linked in a workflow, and data exchange between the applications participating in the workflow is implicitly managed by the IT framework. SynfiniWay is platform-independent, allowing almost any distributed heterogeneous platform to be linked into its virtualised IT framework.
IT framework
A virtualised IT framework is implemented with SynfiniWay by installing a component with specific software agents on each of the systems in the framework. There are three major types of components in SynfiniWay:
Director, which manages end-user connection, authentication & authorisation, and workflow task scheduling and execution.
Service Manager, which publishes and runs services on behalf of users and which executes data migration.
Acquaintance Manager, which links one remote network, known as a SynfiniWay neighborhood, to another to allow resource discovery and file transfer between components residing in different neighbourhoods.
All components are based on Java, so that they can be deployed in a multi-platform environment. An example framework with two neighbourhoods is shown in the figure. Adding or removing components is automatically detected by the framework. The SynfiniWay meta-scheduler automatically adjusts to changes in Service Manager or service availability.
Service management
SynfiniWay is geared towards service management. This means that an application or a command that will be utilised is defined as a service and published on the SynfiniWay IT framework. Simple or complex tasks can be abstracted into services for execution. By using these abstracted services, a user can easily run applications or commands regardless of how complex they may be or what underlying IT infrastructure is required. They provide a form of virtualisation of computing resources since the user need not be aware of where the service is available or how it is run.
Workflow management
A technical or business process is created by linking services in a workflow. Workflows in SynfiniWay are based on WfMC version 1.0. A workflow defines one or more tasks that will be executed with a given execution logic (branch, loop, conditional). SynfiniWay supports multi-instance tasks which run a service multiple times concurrently. Also it supports a workflow of workflows, whereby a workflow can be executed as a task of a higher level workflow.
Data handling
Files needed by a service are automatically transferred to the computer executing that service so that the user is freed from having to manage file transfers. A file transfer mechanism is used allowing files to be transferred directly from the source to the target computer system, going through any number of firewalls between source and target, without being stored on any of the intermediary systems. This mechanism uses the shortest path for transferring files to a target computer from the source.
Meta-scheduling
SynfiniWay employs a meta-scheduling capability, optimizing computational workloads by combining the multiple distributed Resource Managers an organisation is using, into a single aggregated view, allowing batch jobs to be directed to the best location for execution, using local resource managers such as LSF, PBSPro, SGE, LoadLeveler. SynfiniWay is able to schedule and execute services which are deployed on a mixed interlinked set of local resource managers.

The 1923–24 Ottawa Senators season was the club's 39th season of play and seventh season in the NHL. Coming off a Stanley Cup Championship in 1923, they had won three cups in the previous four seasons. The Senators moved into the brand new Ottawa Auditorium prior to the season. The club had an outstanding regular season, but lost in the NHL playoffs to the Montreal Canadiens.
Team business
The five-year partnership of the Ottawa Arena Club expired in 1923. The team's ownership was unified with the parent Ottawa Hockey Association which was to be owned by Frank Ahearn and Tommy Gorman. Ted Dey gave up his half-interest in the Senators first for an investment in the Association and the Auditorium, then sold his share to Ahearn and Gorman.
Regular season
Cy Denneny led the NHL in scoring with 22 goals and 23 points, while Frank Nighbor became the first player to win the Hart Trophy, awarded to the MVP of the league. The Sens defense were led by Buck Boucher and King Clancy, who both finished among the league leaders in points.
Clint Benedict had another very solid season, as his 15 wins and 3 shutouts led the NHL, and he had a personal best GAA of 1.99.
In a game in late February, the Senators were late for a game against the Montreal Canadiens in Montreal due to their train being snowbound in Hawkesbury, Ontario for the night. While out to try to get some food for his teammates Cy Denneny fell down a well, but sustained no injuries from the fall.
December
The defending Stanley Cup champions Ottawa Senators opened the 1923-24 season on the road in Hamilton on December 15. Ottawa, led by a two goal game by Frank Nighbor, defeated the Hamilton Tigers 3-2.
The Senators returned home on December 19, as their home opener was against the Toronto St. Patricks. Ottawa's Cy Denneny and Georges Boucher each scored twice, as the Senators defeated the St. Pats 5-2.
Ottawa did not play again for a week, as the Montreal Canadiens visited Ottawa on December 26. The Senators stayed hot, as Cy Denneny scored the overtime winner as the Senators defeated Montreal 4-3. The Senators winning streak would be snapped in their last game in December, as the Hamilton Tigers, led by an overtime goal by Shorty Green, defeated Ottawa 3-2 on December 29.
The Senators finished December with a 3-1-0 record in four games. The Senators and Toronto St. Patricks were tied for first with six points, however, the Senators had played one fewer game than Toronto.
January
The Senators opened the month of January with a road game in Toronto, as the team returned to the win column with a 4-3 win over the Toronto St. Patricks in a battle for first place on January 2. Three nights later, the clubs faced off once again, this time back in Ottawa. The Senators stormed out to a 6-0 lead after two periods, cruising to a 7-3 win over the St. Pats.
Ottawa stayed hot as the Montreal Canadiens visited on January 9. The Senators scored two late third period goals, including the game winner by Punch Broadbent with 50 seconds left in the game, to defeat the Canadiens 2-1. Ottawa extended their winning streak to four games with a 3-2 overtime win over the Hamilton Tigers on January 12, improving their overall record to 7-1-0.
Ottawa's winning streak was snapped, as the Montreal Canadiens, on an overtime goal by Sprague Cleghorn, defeated Ottawa 2-1 on January 16 in Montreal.
The Senators returned to the win column in their next game three nights later, as Ottawa defeated the Tigers 2-1 on an overtime winning goal by Cy Denneny. Ottawa returned to Montreal on January 21, as King Clancy scored twice for the Senators in a 3-2 win over the Canadiens. Two nights later, the Senators extended their winning streak to three games, demolishing the St. Patricks 5-1 in Toronto.
Ottawa's three game winning streak ended, as the Senators dropped a 5-1 decision to the Hamilton Tigers on January 26. In their final game of January, the Senators returned to the win column, as Ottawa easily defeated the St. Patricks 7-2.
Ottawa finished January with a record of 8-2-0 during the month. Overall, the Senators record at the end of January was 11-3-0, earning 22 points, as the Senators were in first place in the NHL, eight points ahead of the second place Toronto St. Patricks.
February/March
Ottawa began February with a 1-0 loss to the Montreal Canadiens as Georges Vezina earned the shutout for the Canadiens on February 2. The two clubs faced each other again four nights later in Ottawa, as the Senators, led by two goals by Cy Denneny and a shutout by Clint Benedict defeated the Canadiens 4-0.
On February 9, the Senators Clint Benedict recorded his second consecutive shutout, as the Senators defeated the Hamilton Tigers 1-0. Frank Nighbor scored the lone goal in the victory.
Ottawa headed to Toronto for a match-up against the Toronto St. Patricks on February 13. The Senators took an early 2-0 lead, however, the St.Patricks roared back, and won the game 4-2. The two teams met up again three nights later in Ottawa, however, the St. Patricks won 2-1, as Ottawa lost consecutive games for the first time all season. Ottawa's losing skid hit three games, as the Montreal Canadiens shutout Ottawa 3-0.
On February 21, the Senators snapped their losing skid, as Ottawa shutout Montreal 1-0, with Clint Benedict recording the shutout. Four nights later, the Senators King Clancy scored three goals, as Ottawa defeated the Hamilton Tigers 7-4.
The Senators lost to the Tigers in the second game of the home-and-home series in Hamilton on March 1. Four nights later, the Senators concluded the season with a 8-4 win over the Toronto St. Patricks, as Cy Denneny scored four goals to lead Ottawa to the win.
Ottawa finished the season with a 5-5-0 record during February and March. The Senators finished the season in first place in the NHL with a 16-8-0 record, six points ahead of the second place Montreal Canadiens.

Schedule and results
Playoffs
The Senators again qualified for the playoffs and faced the Canadiens for the brand-new Prince of Wales Trophy. Ottawa was defending champion and had the top record for the regular season. In an upset Montreal defeated Ottawa 5–2 in a two-game total goal series. Benedict's play came under criticism, with the Senators management publicly stating he was under the weather, and privately were withholding pay from Benedict on account of drinking affecting his play. The dispute ended up in court and Benedict would be traded to the Montreal Maroons before the next season.
On March 25, the Canadiens and Calgary Tigers Stanley Cup Final game was played at the Ottawa Auditorium, due to the Mount Royal Arena in Montreal not having artificial ice. Montreal won the game and the 1924 Stanley Cup.

The World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (WIPO Copyright Treaty or WCT) is an international treaty on copyright law adopted by the member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996. It provides additional protections for copyright to respond to advances in information technology since the formation of previous copyright treaties before it. As of August 2021, the treaty has 110 contracting parties. The WCT and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, are together termed WIPO "internet treaties".
History
During the earlier stages of negotiations, the WCT was seen as a protocol to the Berne Convention, constituting an update of that agreement since the 1971 Stockholm Conference. However, as any amendment to the Berne Convention required unanimous consent of all parties, the WCT was conceptualized as an additional treaty which supplemented the Berne Convention. The collapse of negotiations around the extension of the Berne Convention during the 1980s saw the shifting of the forum to the GATT, resulting in the TRIPS Agreement. Thus, the nature of any copyright treaty by the World Intellectual Property Organization became considerably narrower, being limited to addressing the challenges posed by digital technologies.
Protection granted by the Treaty
The WCT emphasizes the incentive nature of copyright protection, claiming its importance to creative endeavours. It ensures that computer programs are protected as literary works (Article 4), and that the arrangement and selection of material in databases is protected (Article 5). It provides authors of works with control over their rental and distribution in Articles 6 to 8, which they may not have under the Berne Convention alone. It also prohibits circumvention of technological measures for the protection of works (Article 11) and unauthorized modification of rights management information contained in works (Article 12).
The treaty has been criticised for being too broad (for example in its prohibition of circumvention of technical protection measures, even where such circumvention is used in the pursuit of legal and fair use rights) and for applying a "one size fits all" standard to all signatory countries, despite their widely differing stages of economic development and knowledge industry.
Implementation
The WIPO Copyright Treaty is implemented in United States law by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). By Decision 2000/278/EC of 16 March 2000, the Council of the European Union approved the treaty on behalf of the European Community. European Union Directives which largely cover the subject matter of the treaty are: Directive 91/250/EC, creating copyright protection for software; Directive 96/9/EC on copyright protection for databases; and Directive 2001/29/EC, prohibiting devices for circumventing "technical protection measures", such as digital rights management (also known as DRM).

Federal elections were held in Czechoslovakia on 8 and 9 June 1990, alongside elections for the Czech and Slovak Assemblies. They were the first elections held in the country since the Velvet Revolution seven months earlier. Voter turnout was 96.2%.
The movement led by President Václav Havel emerged as the largest bloc, with majorities in both houses of parliament–something that no Czechoslovak party or alliance had previously achieved in a free election. The Czech wing, Civic Forum (OF), won 68 of the 150 seats in the House of the People and 50 of the 150 seats in the House of Nations, whilst its Slovak counterpart, Public Against Violence (VPN), won 19 seats in the House of the People and 33 in the House of Nations. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, running in its first election since giving up power, made a stronger showing than expected, receiving 13 percent of the vote in both chambers, finishing second behind Civic Forum.
Although OF and VPN had more than enough seats between them to govern without the support of other parties, they sought a broader base. They let it be known that they were willing to go into coalition with any party except the Communists and the Slovak National Party.

The following is a list of annual leaders in putouts in Major League Baseball (MLB), with separate lists for the American League and the National League. The list also includes several professional leagues and associations that were never part of MLB.
In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by a Tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base (a tagout), catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a Force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a flyout), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference.
Jake Beckley is the all-time leader in career putouts with 23,743. Jiggs Donahue holds the record for most putouts in a season with 1,846 in 1907. Frank McCormick, Steve Garvey, Bill Terry, and Ernie Banks have all led the league in putouts 5 times. Albert Pujols is the active leader in putouts and has led the league 4 times.

Arthur Mueller "Joe" Pearce (28 January 1885 – 25 April 1915) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Throughout his life, he was always known as "Joe".
He was a member of the First AIF, and was killed in action whilst landing at Gallipoli, Ottoman Turkey on 25 April 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign. His 152 League games became the most of any VFL player killed in World War I.
Family
The son of Arthur John Pearce, the headmaster of the Bendigo Grammar School, and Lena Margaret Pearce, née Mueller, he was born at Sandhurst (Bendigo) on 28 January 1885. He was educated at Bendigo Grammar School, and was employed in a well-paid position in the Australian Mutual Provident Society, firstly in Bendigo, and then in Melbourne.
Once he had moved to Melbourne he became very involved in the community of the Anglican Holy Trinity Church, in East Melbourne; he was Church Treasurer, the Sunday School Superintendent, the Secretary of the Church of England Men's Society, and a member of the church choir.
His cousin, Jack Mueller, played 216 senior VFL games for Melbourne from 1934 to 1950.
Footballer
Recruited from the South Bendigo Football Club in 1904, he played as a strict amateur, and even refused to accept out-of-pocket expenses.
He played his first senior game for Melbourne, aged 19, against Collingwood, at the MCG, on Saturday, 14 May 1904 (round two). Pearce played well in a Melbourne team that lost by 6 points to Collingwood.
He played his last senior match for Melbourne against Essendon, on the MCG, on Saturday, 30 August 1913 (round eighteen). Essendon won by 10 points, 6.16 (52) to 6.6 (42), and Pearce was one of the best players in a losing team.
A specialist full-back, Pearce was a regular player for Melbourne from 1904 to 1913, and was noted for "clear[ing] his goal with a dash which took the ball past the centre", playing 152 games, and represented Victoria at the 1908 Melbourne Carnival.
In 1922, champion full-forward Dick Lee, who played for Collingwood from 1906 to 1922, told a reporter that he thought that Pearce was, by far, the best full-back of his day; and only matched in that time (1922) by the current Richmond full-back Vic Thorp.
Sportsman
He played sub-district cricket with Coburg, and also played with the Melbourne Cricket Club's Club XI's. He was also good at lawn tennis, and at lacrosse.
Soldier
Leaving his lucrative employment as a clerk with the Australian Mutual Provident Society, he enlisted in the First AIF on 17 August 1914 (he was the eighth man to enlist at Essendon on day one); he was immediate given the rank of Lance-Corporal, and was promoted to Corporal on 6 April 1915.
Death
He was killed in action with the 7th Battalion, whilst taking part in the landings at Gallipoli, Ottoman Turkey on 25 April 1915. He was shot before his boat could reach the beach.
In May 1919, an unidentified former Melbourne footballer, wrote to the football correspondent of The Argus as follows:
"In 1914 the Melbourne football team, after its junction with the University, was a fine team, and succeeded in reaching the semi-finals.Out of this combination the following players enlisted and served at the front:—C.

Lilley, who, as a matter of fact, takes the field under some disability owing to severe wounds which he received on service." — The Argus, 16 May 1919.
Remembered
He was buried at No 2 Outpost Cemetery, Gallipoli, Turkey (one and a half miles from where he first landed), and his name is located name is located at panel 51 in the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial. A bronze memorial plaque was erected at the Holy Trinity Church, East Melbourne.
On Saturday, 12 June 1915, playing against Essendon (in round eight), "the Melbourne players wore black armbands, as a token of respect for a former comrade, Lance-Corporal Pearce, a well-known back man of a few seasons ago, who was killed in action at the Dardanelles".
As a devoted church-man, Joe Pearce would have been pleased to know that he was the subject of a sermon, "Football, the Game and the Barracker", delivered by Rev. Ernest George Petherick (1879–1950) at the Horsham Presbyterian Church on Sunday, 12 September 1926.
His sister Ethel, and a "F.W. Hastings" each inserted an "In Memoriam" notice in the newspaper, every year, at least until 1956.

Gel casting is a direct foaming technique used to produce ceramic and polymeric scaffolds.
History
Gel casting was developed in Canada in the 1960s and ever since it became an interesting manufacturing forming process for near-net-shape, very large, high-quality, complex ceramic parts with specified threshold strength.
Process
In this technique, the precursor materials typically consist of a monomer, cross linker, free radical initiator or catalysts are placed into an aqueous suspension. Such precursor conforms a slurry that is then foamed before it undergoes direct consolidation step. In this step, the binder becomes polymerized to consolidate the particle structure within the precursor slurry. The process then forms a gel type of mixture which is then cast into a proper mould. The next step after the gel solidification, it is removed from the mould in a controlled manner and then being dried to form a green body. The outcome here has interesting mechanical properties and is capable of being machined at this step. Eventually, the binder is burnt out and the final scaffold sintering will take place.

The Central National Bank building is a 23-story Art Deco skyscraper located in Richmond, Virginia. Completed in 1929, it was one of the first skyscrapers in the city of Richmond not in the heart of the financial district. According to architectural historian Richard Guy Wilson, it and the West Hospital building, are the only two skyscrapers in Richmond to have used the fashionable Art Deco ziggurat-inspired setback, and only a few others exist elsewhere in Virginia. When the bank later changed hands, it was known as the Central Fidelity Bank. It was used as a branch bank for Wachovia Corp. until that closed in 2000. After nearly fifteen years of vacancy, it was converted into apartments, and the first resident moved into the building in mid-2016. The redevelopment is called to "Deco at CNB," a 200-apartment development by Douglas Development Corp.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is located in the Grace Street Commercial Historic District.

Spectral modeling synthesis (SMS) is an acoustic modeling approach for speech and other signals.
SMS considers sounds as a combination of harmonic content and noise content. Harmonic components are identified based on peaks in the frequency spectrum of the signal, normally as found by the short-time Fourier transform. The signal that remains following removal of the spectral components, sometimes referred to as the residual, is then modeled as white noise passed through a time-varying filter. The output of the model, then, are the frequencies and levels of the detected harmonic components and the coefficients of the time-varying filter.
Intuitively, the model can be applied to many types of audio signals. Speech signals, for example, include slowly changing harmonic sounds caused by vibration of the vocal cords plus wideband, noise-like sounds caused by the lips and mouth. Musical instruments also produce sounds containing both harmonic components and percussive, noise-like sounds when the notes are struck or changed.

The Nordfjord—Sogn Detachment (NSD) is a major extensional shear zone up to 6 km in thickness, which extends about 120 km along strike from Nordfjord to Sognefjord, bringing Devonian continental coarse clastic sedimentary rocks into close contact with eclogite facies metamorphic rocks of the Western Gneiss Region. It formed towards the end of the Caledonian Orogeny and was mainly active during the Devonian. It has an estimated displacement of at least 70 km and possibly as much as 110 km. It was reactivated during the Mesozoic and may have influenced the development of fault structures in the North Sea rift basin.
Extent
The NSD is recognised from the western end of the Sognefjord through to the northern shore of Bremanger, a distance of about 120 km. The exposure is fairly continuous, broken occasionally by fjords and some later high-angle faults, such as the Standal Fault. There is evidence from seismic reflection data that the structure continues offshore to the west.
Geometry
The NSD has an overall low westward dip, although its sinuous outcrop shows that it has a folded geometry with a series of west-plunging antiforms and synforms, with Devonian sediments preserved in four of the larger synforms as the Solund, Kvamshesten, Håsteinen and Hornelen basins. It places rocks of the Upper Plate in tectonic contact with rocks of the Lower Plate.
Bounding plates
The upper plate of the NSD consists of rocks of the highest tectonostratigraphic levels of the Norwegian Caledonides, the upper allochthon, unconformably overlain by conglomerates and sandstone of Devonian age.
The lower plate of the NSD is formed by the Western Gneiss Region.
The detachment
The detachment itself consists of a thick sequence of highly deformed rocks with both lithological banding and foliation parallel to the top of the zone. At the base of the zone, rocks of the Western Gneiss Region become progressively more reworked and more heavily deformed upwards, passing from protomylonite to mylonite. Towards the top of the zone it becomes an ultramylonite before that in turn becomes overprinted by brittle deformation structures, including veins of pseudotachylyte, with a thin zone of cataclasite marking the top. The base of the zone contains eclogites but the metamorphic grade of the mylonites decrease upwards from medium-grade (amhibolite facies), to low-grade (greenschist facies) near the top. The protolith of the mylonites changes from gneissic basement towards the base of the zone to sedimentary and volcanic towards the top.
Cause
The NSD is one of the largest structures formed during the extensional late orogenic to post-orogenic collapse of the Caledonian mountain belt. This zone of thickened crust, which reached an estimated thickness of over 80 km, began to spread gravitationally during the Devonian period. This period of extensional tectonics affected most of the Caledonian belt, including Northern Scotland, East Greenland and Norway. In Norway, after initial reactivation of the larger thrusts in extension, the whole pile of Caledonian thrust sheets was cross-cut by a series of large extensional shear zones, including the NSD, the Hardangerfjord Shear Zone, the Karmøy Shear Zone and the Bergen Arc Shear Zone.

Giuseppe Andreoli (San Possidonio, Province of Modena, January 11, 1720 – Mirandola, April 3, 1776) was an Italian painter.
Biography
He studied in Bologna, under Giuseppe Peracini. He painted for the Duomo of Mirandola, a canvas depicting St Possidonio, destroyed during the restorations of 1858. He painted a canvas depicting the Assumption of the Virgin with twelve Apostles donated to the church of San Francesco. He painted the sacristy of the Oratory of the Santissimi Sacramento the Annunciation and two medallions in the Choir.
He painted a San Luigi Gonzaga for the parish church of Tramuschio, a frazione of Mirandola, commissioned by Domenico Paltrinieri. Late in life he developed gangrene and required bilateral leg amputation.
This painter is likely related to Giuseppe Andreoli, also born in San Possidonio, born 1791, and died in Rubiera, October 17, 1822) who was a priest and Italian patriot.
A painter of the same name, born 1932 in Carpi, began painting in 1997.

Mohsen Emadi () (born 29 October 1976) is a poet, translator and filmmaker. Born and raised in Iran, he left for Finland in 2009 and has resided primarily in Mexico since 2012, working as a lecturer and researcher in poetry and comparative literature for various institutes in the country.
Biography
Mohsen Emadi was born in Sari, in northern Iran province of Mazandaran. He began writing poems during childhood and appeared in numerous magazines as a young adult.
In 1995, he moved to Tehran to study computer engineering at Sharif University of Technology, where he co-founded multiple student magazines and co-organized two conferences on cinema and philosophy, all confronted by university authorities. Being influenced by Federico García Lorca and the folklore of Mazandaran, he got to know Ahmad Shamlou as his mentor, and was introduced to Generation of '27 of Spain by him. He was an active member of Iranian Student Protests of July 1999, and again 10 years later, 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, the latter forcing him to leave the country. He has since been described as being "exiled" from his home country.
He landed in Finland in 2009 to study digital culture at University of Jyväskylä. Later he lived in the Czech Republic and Spain, before moving to Mexico in August 2012, working as a lecturer and researcher in poetry and comparative literature.
Although he has spent some time in the United States, Emadi reportedly left in early 2017 after then president of the United States, Donald Trump, made Executive Order 13769, which would temporarily ban citizens of various Muslim-majority countries.
Poetry
His first poetry collection, La flor en los renglones (The Flower on the Lines), was published in Spain in 2003.

Victoria Day () is a federal Canadian public holiday celebrated on the last Monday preceding May 25. Initially in honour of Queen Victoria's birthday, it has since been celebrated as the official birthday of Canada's sovereign. It is informally considered to be the beginning of the summer season in Canada.
The holiday has been observed in Canada since at least 1845, originally falling on Victoria's actual birthday (May 24). The holiday has always been a distinctly Canadian observance and continues to be celebrated across the country. It falls on the Monday between the 18th and the 24th (inclusive) and so is always the penultimate Monday of May ( in and in ).
Victoria Day is a federal statutory holiday, as well as a holiday in six of Canada's ten provinces and all three of its territories. In Quebec, before 2003, the Monday preceding May 25 of each year was unofficially the , a commemoration of Adam Dollard des Ormeaux initiated in the 1920s to coincide with Victoria Day. In 2003, provincial legislation officially created National Patriots' Day on the same date.
History
The birthday of Queen Victoria was a day for celebration in Canada long before Confederation, with the first legislation in this regard being passed in 1845 by the parliament of the Province of Canada to officially recognize May 24 as the Queen's birthday. It was noted that on that date in 1854, the 35th birthday of Queen Victoria, some 5,000 residents of Canada West gathered in front of Government House (near present-day King and Simcoe Streets in Toronto) to "give cheers to their queen". An example of a typical 19th century celebration of the Queen's birthday took place on May 24, 1866, in Omemee, also in Canada West: the town mounted a day-long fête to mark the occasion, including a gun salute at midnight, pre-dawn serenades, picnics, athletic competitions, a display of illuminations, and a torch-light procession; such events were common around the colony and, by the 1890s, the day had become a "patriotic holiday".
Following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, May 24 was made a legal holiday to be known as "Victoria Day", a date to remember the late queen, who was deemed the "Mother of Confederation", and, in 1904, the same date was by imperial decree made Empire Day throughout the British Empire. Over the ensuing decades, the official date in Canada of the reigning sovereign's birthday changed through various royal proclamations until the haphazard format was abandoned in 1952. That year, both Empire Day and Victoria Day were, by order-in-council and statutory amendment, respectively, moved to the Monday before May 25 and the monarch's official birthday in Canada was by regular viceregal proclamations made to fall on this same date every year between 1953 and January 31, 1957, when the link was made permanent by royal proclamation. The following year, Empire Day was renamed Commonwealth Day and in 1977 it was moved to the second Monday in March, leaving the Monday before May 25 as both Victoria Day and the sovereign's official birthday.
Victoria Day celebrations have been marred by major tragedy at least twice: In 1881, the passenger ferry Victoria overturned in the Thames River, near London, Ontario. The boat departed in the evening with 600 to 800 people on board—three times the allowable passenger capacity—and capsized part way across the river, drowning some 182 individuals, including a large number of children who had been with their families for Victoria Day picnics at Springbank Park. The event came to be known as the "Victoria Day disaster". Then, on May 26, 1896, the Point Ellice Bridge disaster occurred in Victoria, British Columbia, when a bridge collapsed under the weight of a streetcar overloaded with passengers on their way to attend Victoria Day celebrations.
In 2013, a group of prominent Canadian actors, authors, and politicians sent a petition to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, requesting that the holiday be renamed "Victoria and First Peoples Day".
Provincial and territorial legislation
Most workplaces in Canada are regulated by the provincial or territorial governments. Therefore, although Victoria Day is a statutory holiday for federal purposes, whether an employee is entitled to a paid day off generally depends on the province or territory of residence (with the exception of employees in federally regulated workplaces such as banks).
The status of Victoria Day in each of the provinces and territories is as follows: It is a general holiday in Alberta, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, and Yukon and is a statutory holiday in British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. Victoria Day is not a paid public holiday in Newfoundland and Labrador, but is a government holiday; Nova Scotia, where it is also not a designated retail closing day, but is considered a "non-statutory holiday"; and Prince Edward Island, although provincial legislation defines "holiday" to include Victoria Day.
In Nunavut and New Brunswick, the date is set as a general holiday (for New Brunswick, a prescribed day of rest on which retail businesses must be closed) to mark the reigning sovereign's official birthday. In Quebec, the day was nicknamed the which commemorated Adam Dollard des Ormeaux. In 2003, the National Assembly of Quebec named it National Patriots' Day, commemorating the patriotes of the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837.
Practice
Canada is the only country that commemorates Queen Victoria with an official holiday. Federal government protocol dictates that, on Victoria Day, the Royal Union Flag is to be flown from sunrise to sunset at all federal government buildingsincluding airports, military bases, and other Crown owned property across the countrywhere physical arrangements allow (i.e. where a second flag pole exists, as the Royal Union Flag can never displace the national flag).
Several cities hold a parade on the holiday, with the most prominent being that which has taken place since 1898 in the monarch's namesake city of Victoria, British Columbia. In nearby New Westminster, the Victoria Day weekend is distinguished by the Hyack Anvil Battery Salute, a tradition created during colonial times as a surrogate for a 21-gun salute: Gunpowder is placed between two anvils, the top one upturned, and the charge is ignited, hurling the upper anvil into the air. Other celebrations include an evening fireworks show, such as that held at Ashbridge's Bay Beach in the east end of Toronto, and at Ontario Place, in the same city.
In Ottawa, the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony takes place on Parliament Hill or at Rideau Hall on occasion. The reviewing officer in the ceremony is the monarch, with members of the Royal Family, the Governor General, the Minister of National Defence or the Chief of the Defence Staff taking his place in his absence. The participating units in the parade include personnel of the Governor General's Foot Guards and The Canadian Grenadier Guards, both of which are part of the ad hoc Ceremonial Guard.
Across the country, Victoria Day serves as the unofficial marker of the end of the winter social season, and thus the beginning of the summer social calendar. Banff, Alberta's Sunshine Village ends its lengthy ski season on Victoria Day and, likewise, it is during this long weekend that many summer businesses—such as parks, outdoor restaurants, bicycle rentals, city tour operators, etc.—will open. Victoria Day is also a mark of the beginning of the cottage season, when cottage owners may reverse the winterization of their property. Gardeners in Canada will similarly regard Victoria Day as the beginning of spring, as it falls at a time when one can be fairly certain that frost will not return until the next autumn. There is also a change in fashion: lighter-coloured summer clothing was traditionally worn from Victoria Day through until Labour Day.
The holiday is colloquially known in parts of Canada as "May Two-Four"; a double entendre that refers both to the date around which the holiday falls (May 24) and the Canadian slang for a case of twenty-four beers (a "two-four"), a drink popular during the long weekend. The holiday weekend may also be known as the "May long weekend", "May Long", or "May Run", and the term "Firecracker Day" was once employed in Ontario.
A traditional, short song about Victoria Day went as follows: "The twenty-fourth of May / Is the Queen's birthday; / If they don't give us a holiday / We'll all run away!" The holiday is referenced in the song "Lakeside Park" by Canadian rock band Rush, from their 1975 album Caress of Steel. The song features the line, "everyone would gather on the 24th of May, sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display".

The 87th Tactical Missile Squadron is an inactive squadron of the United States Air Force last based at RAF Molesworth, England. The squadron was originally activated as the 8th Reconnaissance Squadron. The unit served on antisubmarine patrol early in World War II, then as a training unit until it was disbanded in 1944.
The 887th Tactical Missile Squadron was active as a Mace missile unit in Germany from 1962 to 1966.
In September 1985 the two squadrons were consolidated. However, the consolidated squadron remained inactive until August 1986. In that month it was reactivated as a BGM-109G Gryphon cruise missile squadron in the United Kingdom. It was inactivated in January 1989 as required by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
History
World War II
The squadron was first activated as the 8th Reconnaissance Squadron (Light) in early 1941. It was one of the four original squadrons of the 46th Bombardment Group. In August the squadron changed its role to bombardment and was redesignated the 87th Bombardment Squadron. The 87th was equipped with Douglas A-20 Havoc aircraft at Hunter Field, Georgia. The 51st participated in maneuvers, including desert maneuvers, and flew anti-submarine warfare patrol and search missions over the Gulf of Mexico in early 1942.
The squadron later served as an operational training unit, which involved the use of an oversized parent unit to provide cadres for "satellite groups." In late 1943 the squadron mission changed to replacement training of individual pilots and aircrews. Just before disbanding, it began to convert to North American B-25 Mitchells.
However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit. This resulted in the squadron, along with other units at Morris Field, being disbanded and its personnel, equipment and functions transferred to the 333d AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Light Bombardment).
887th Tactical Missile Squadron
The 887th Tactical Missile Squadron was organized in September 1962 at Sembach AB, Germany and assigned to the 38th Tactical Missile Wing. At Sembach the squadron operated the TM-76A Mace missile from Site III "Hacksaw" – ENE of Sembach AB .
The squadron was discontinued and inactivated on 25 September 1966 along with its parent wing as United States Air Forces Europe reduced its tactical missile force.
From 1975 – 1978, Site III "Hacksaw" was used by Det B, 502nd Army Security Agency (ASA) Bn for the Guardrail I, II, and IIa Integrated Processing Facility (IPF) site. The unit was redesignated as the 330th Electronic Warfare Aviation Company (Forward) (330th EW Avn Co (FWD)), and resubordinated to the 2nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Aerial Exploitation) in 1978. It appears that this unit used the RC-12 Guardrail aircraft.
From 1979 – 1985, Site III "Hacksaw" was upgraded to the Guardrail V (GRV) IPF, and in the fall of 1985 the unit moved to Echterdingen Army Airfield (Stuttgart International Airport). The site was subsequently used by various and sundry communications units on deployment before being closed and turned over to the German government.
In September 1985, the 887th TMS was consolidated with the 87th Bombardment Squadron but it remained inactive.
Ground Launched Cruise Missile
The consolidated squadron was redesignated 87th Tactical Missile Squadron and reactivated at RAF Molesworth as a BGM-109G Gryphon cruise missile squadron in August 1986. It maintained 64 operational cruise missiles at combat readiness. The squadron was inactivated in January 1989 as a result of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which resulted in the elimination of the BGM-109G missile from service.

Jules Vuillemin (; ; 15 February 1920 – 16 January 2001) was a French philosopher, Professor of Philosophy of Knowledge at the prestigious Collège de France, in Paris, from 1962 to 1990, succeeding Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Professor emeritus from 1991 to 2001. He was an Invited Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey (1968).
At the Collège de France, Vuillemin introduced analytical philosophy to France. Vuillemin's thought had a major influence on Jacques Bouveresse's works. Vuillemin himself vindicated the legacy of Martial Gueroult.
A friend of Michel Foucault, he supported his election at the Collège de France, and was also close to Michel Serres.
Biography
After studying at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, he completed his agrégation in 1943, being received premier ex aequo alongside Tran Duc Thao. A student of French historical epistemologists Gaston Bachelard and Jean Cavaillès, he was however at first influenced by phenomenology and existentialism, before shifting towards study of logics and science. In 1962, he published a book titled The Philosophy of Algebra, dedicated to the mathematician Pierre Samuel, a member of the Bourbaki group, as well as to René Thom, to the physicist Raymond Siestrunck and to the linguist George Vallet. Vuillemin thought that renewals of methods in mathematics have influenced philosophy, thus relating the discovery of irrational numbers to Platonism, algebraic geometry to Cartesianism, infinitesimal calculus to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Furthermore, he observed that philosophy had not yet taken into account the changes brought to mathematics by Joseph Louis Lagrange and Évariste Galois.
In 1968, he co-founded with Gilles-Gaston Granger the journal L'Âge de la Science. He was one of the main commentators of Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rudolf Carnap and Willard Van Orman Quine in France.
Vuillemin also took an interest into aesthetics, beside writing several books on Kant, Anselm or on Diodorus's master argument (see problem of future contingents).
Jules Vuillemin's Archives
The Jules Vuillemin's Archives are located in France at the Laboratoire d'Histoire des Sciences et de Philosophie - Archives Henri Poincaré.
Gilles-Gaston Granger was, until his death in 2016, the president of the scientific committee of Jules Vuillemin's Archives.

Paul E. Haeberli is an American computer graphics programmer and researcher.
Biography
Paul Haeberli studied for a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, United States.
Haeberli was recruited by James H. Clark to join Silicon Graphics during the company's founding. Haeberli's early work included code, developed with David J. Brown and Mark Grossman, for SGI's first product – the Iris1000. Between 1983–1999, Haeberli continued at Silicon Graphics in Silicon Valley, California. He worked on the early MEX window system for Silicon Graphics workstations. He was also involved in non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) techniques in computer graphics, producing software to implement this approach. He devised the Silicon Graphics Image (SGI) format for graphics files. Later, he became an initial member of the research team at Silicon Graphics.
After Silicon Graphics, Haeberli joined Shutterfly, where he developed much of the online technology and image-processing foundations for the system that Shutterfly later employed in production.
Subsequently he founded Lamina Design, which allows freeform structures to be constructed from sheet material using computer-based techniques. The company is based in Madison, Wisconsin.

The Doktoringenieur (acronym Dr.-Ing., also Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften) is the German engineering doctorate degree, comparable to the Doctor of Engineering, Engineering Doctorate, Doctor of Science (Engineering), Doctor of Science (Technology) or a PhD in Engineering or Architecture.
It was first introduced in 1899, in the context of the centenary of the Technical University of Berlin, at the Prussian Institutes of Technology. The other German states adopted it in the following years. In contrast to the other historic doctoral degrees (e.g. Dr. phil., Dr. iur. or Dr. med.), the Doktoringenieur was not titled in Latin but German, and therefore written with dash (Dr.-Ing.).
In the field of mathematics, computer science and natural sciences, some universities offer the choice between Dr.-Ing. and Dr. rer. nat. based on the primary focus of the dissertation. If the contributions focus slightly more on applied scientific engineering a Dr.-Ing. is given, while a Dr. rer. nat. is preferred if the dissertation contains more theoretical scientific contributions. A German doctorate is usually a research doctorate and is awarded in the context of the so-called Promotion that also requires a dissertation.
It should not be confused with a Dutch double title dr. ing., indicating that one holds both a research doctorate (dr.) from a university and an engineer's degree (ing.) from a Dutch polytechnic (i.e. Hogeschool).

The Johore Battery was a former British coastal artillery battery located in Changi on the easternmost side of mainland Singapore. It consisted of three large BL 15-inch Mk. I naval guns installed on land by the British government in the late 1930s to defend the approaching path to the east of the island to their large naval base located at Sembawang in the north (accessed via the Johor Straits) from an attacking enemy naval force.
History
Five massive 15–inch naval guns were installed in Singapore by the British government before 1940, with three based in Changi to the east and two located in Buona Vista to the southwest. Collectively, the three naval guns in Changi formed the Johore Battery, named after the King of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim, who gave King George V of the UK a grand royal gift of £500,000 for his Silver Jubilee in 1935, of which £400,000 of the amount was used by the British government to fund the installation of the three large naval guns in Changi. In early 1942, the Johore Battery was employed in the Allied artillery bombardment of Johor Bahru, which at that time was under Japanese military occupation following the retreat of all Allied forces from British Malaya to Singapore.
Built by the British government in 1939 for the naval defence of Singapore (in particular, to defend Singapore from an aggressive Imperial Japan, which had possessed a strong and a powerful navy by the later part of the 1930s and was expanding deeper and deeper into China), the Johore Battery is a large gun emplacement site consisting of a labyrinth of tunnels. These tunnels were used to store quantities of ammunition for the three 15-inch guns (most of which were of the armour-piercing (AP) type rather than the high-explosive (HE) type as these naval guns were intended to be employed against heavily armoured enemy warships).
These naval guns were the largest to be installed on land outside of Britain itself during World War II. They were all destroyed before the official surrender of the British Army on 15 February 1942 to the conquering Imperial Japanese military and the related tunnels (for the storage of the ammunition for the guns and gun-crew quarters) were sealed up and almost forgotten after the war in 1945.
In 1948 one of the guns was demolished and returned to England as scrap. In 1950 the Royal Army Ordnance Corps began an exercise to remove live gun shells that were buried at Changi during the British evacuation in 1942.
The location remained a largely-unknown secret until the Singapore Prisons Service re-discovered them by chance in April 1991.
Conservation
The former site of the Johore battery now includes a replica of the large naval gun and a dummy 15-inch shell, placed upon a modern large lifting-lever; allowing visitors to have a feel of its 800kg weight by trying to hoist it up from the ground. The old, and still inaccessible, tunnels are marked out in a maze of above ground trails. A plaque detailing the history of the battery is present at the hut forming the entrance to the site.
Admission to the site of the battery is free with opening hours 09:00 to 17:00 Monday to Friday. The compound also includes a restaurant. .

The geographical center of Earth is the geometric center of all land surfaces on Earth. Geometrically defined it is the Centroid of all land surfaces within the two dimensions of the Geoid surface which approximates the Earth's outer shape. The term center of minimum distance specifies the concept more precisely as the domain is the sphere surface without boundary and not the sphere as three-dimensional body.
Explained in a different way, it is the location on the surface of Earth where the sum of distances to all locations on land is the smallest. If you had an airplane with an infinite energy resource and fly from one start location on Earth to one location on a land surface somewhere on Earth and back again and repeat that from the same start location to all possible destination locations, the starting locations where the total travel distance sums up as the smallest, marks the geographical center of Earth.
Its distance definition follows the shortest path on the surface of Earth along the Great Circle (orthodrome).
History of the concept
In 1864, Charles Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, gave in his book Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid the coordinates with , the location of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. He stated that this had been calculated by "carefully summing up all the dry land habitable by man all the wide world over".
In October of that year, Smyth proposed to position the prime meridian at the longitude of the Great Pyramid because there it would "pass over more land than [at] any other [location]". He also argued the cultural significance of the location and its vicinity to Jerusalem. The expert committee deciding the issue, however, voted for Greenwich because "so many ships used the port of London". Referring to Smyth's book, Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard wrote in his 1884 book, The Imaginary Metrological System of the Great pyramid of Gizeh , that the perfect location of the Great Pyramid along the longitudinal line could only have been purposefully done by its builders.
In the September 1919 issue of Trestle Board Magazine, Mason William Galliher stated that knowledge of the Great Pyramid being the geographical center was "determined by many years of scientific investigation" and that the Great Pyramid was likely to be the "last of the present land surface of the Earth" to survive a cataclysmic event, due to its positioning.
In 1973, Andrew J. Woods, a physicist with Gulf Energy and Environmental Systems in San Diego, California, used a digital global map and calculated the coordinates on a mainframe system as , in modern-day Turkey, near the district of Kırşehir, Kırşehir Province, approx. 1,800 km north of Giza. In 2003, a refined result was yielded by Holger Isenberg: , also in Turkey, near the district of İskilip, Çorum Province, approx. 200 km northeast of Ankara. In 2016, Google Maps marked Isenberg's result of as the geographical center of Earth.
Differentiation from other definitions and calculations
Various definitions of geographical centers exists. The definition used by the references in this article refer to calculations within the 2 dimensions of a surface, mainly as the surface of Earth is the domain of human cultural existence. Other definitions refer to calculations based on three-dimensional objects, for example the Newtonian gravity center of the whole Earth (physical Barycenter) or the Newtonian gravity center of only the continents as uniform thick three-dimensional objects. Those centers can be found inside Earth mostly near its core. A projection of those centers towards the surface would be then an alternative definition of the geographical center, some of those calculations result in a surface location projection not that far away from the geographical center.

Latter Day Saint martyrs are persons who belonged to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) or another church within the Latter Day Saint movement who were killed or otherwise persecuted to the point of premature death on account of their religious beliefs, or while performing their religious duties.
Although the term "martyr" is not frequently used in Latter Day Saint terminology, Latter Day Saints recognize a number of prophets, apostles, and other religious persons as recorded in the Bible, including both the Old Testament and New Testament, and Book of Mormon as martyrs within the same religious tradition (albeit at an earlier time) to which they subscribe. For Latter Day Saints, the most notable martyr is Jesus Christ. Other scriptural examples include Abel ("the first martyr"), John the Baptist, James, the brother of John, Stephen whose stoning is recorded in the Book of Acts, Abinadi, women and children of Ammonihah, etc. Latter Day Saints also acknowledge as "Early-day Saint" martyrs those early Christians who were killed for their faith prior to or as a result of the Great Apostasy.
The most notable post-Biblical Latter Day Saint martyrs are Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum Smith.
Individuals who die "in the Lord's service" are believed to be rewarded with eternal life: "And whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name's sake, shall find it again, even life eternal." Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, declared: "I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel ... in the great world of the spirits."
In 1989, following the death of two LDS Church missionaries in Bolivia, apostle L. Tom Perry noted that from 1831 until 1989, "only seventeen LDS missionaries [were] killed by assassins." Also at that time, apostle M. Russell Ballard "indicated that of the 447,969 missionaries who have served since the days of Joseph Smith, only 525—about one-tenth of 1 percent—have lost their lives through accident, illness, or other causes while serving. 'When you contemplate that number,' he said, 'it appears that the safest place to be in the whole world is on a full-time mission.'"
Missionaries who died from illness or accident are not listed. However, depending on the circumstances of their death, they could be deemed "martyrs" for having died while in religious service.
Many Mormon pioneers and other early church members who suffered privation and early death on account of their religious beliefs would likely qualify as "martyrs." However, they are too numerous to list here. This list also does not include early Mormon settlers who were killed in encounters with Native Americans during the Mormon settlement of the American West.

KHOC (102.5 FM, "Heart 102.5") is a commercial radio station located in Casper, Wyoming.
All Mt. Rushmore Casper stations are located at 218 N. Wolcott in downtown Casper.
History
The station was first known as KKRR, starting on 1997-10-06. On 1998-10-23, the station changed its call sign to the current KHOC. Citing technical difficulties, the station, along with its five other sister stations went dark for a period of time in August 2011. KVOC, KMLD, and KHOC remained silent as of December 17, 2011. Other than equipment reasons, no further information as to why the three stations were off the air has been provided.
Fines
KHOC, along with other Casper stations owned by Mt. Rushmore Broadcasting were fined $68,000 for using unlicensed Studio/transmitter links, which the company had been using for 16 years. The FCC fined the company $68,000 for "willfully and repeatedly" violating the law, giving the stations' owner 30 days to get licenses for its STLs for KHOC, and sister stations KMLD, KASS, and KQLT.
In 2012, station owner Jan Charles Gray was named in a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Labor for improperly paying employees. Gray called the claims in the lawsuit "bogus".
In 2013, Gray informed the Casper Star Tribune that the lawsuit and a $68,000 fine for unlicensed STLs were "a lot of baloney." Gray said if the FCC doesn't back down, he plans to "sue them on behalf of every radio owner in America that has been wronged by them".

WLKN (98.1 FM, "Lake 98.1") is a radio station licensed to Cleveland, Wisconsin with an adult contemporary format consisting mainly of music from the 1980s until the current day, serving the lakeshore cities of Sheboygan and Manitowoc/Two Rivers, Wisconsin, along with Manitowoc and Sheboygan Counties in general. The station's studio is located in Manitowoc, and the station is owned by Seehafer Broadcasting. The station's transmitter is located north of Cleveland, in the Town of Newton.
The station has some interference within Manitowoc and Two Rivers proper with two stations on adjacent frequencies from Green Bay, WTAQ-FM (97.7) and WQLH (98.5). Because of this, WLKN simulcasts using an FM translator station, W278BQ, at 103.5 FM to serve those cities from the WOMT transmitter site. That translator is separately owned by Magnum Media, which has entered into several sales to Seehafer Broadcasting in the 2020s.
History
The station was formerly WKTT "Kat Country" prior to a format change in 2003, and had been at 103.1 before a frequency change in 1993 in conjunction with WWJR in Sheboygan from 97.7 to 93.7 to facilitate the launch of Kaukauna's WOGB on 103.1. There were more than six FM's affected by the frequency switch, at the time.
On October 9, 2009 after a sale for $600,000 and a four-year consulting fee of $25,000 annually from former owner Radio K-T, Inc. headed by former Clear Channel programmer Jack Taddeo, the station came under the ownership of Seehafer Broadcasting, a locally-run company based in Manitowoc which has owned WOMT (1240) and WQTC-FM (102.3) for decades. Seehafer continues to base WLKN at their Cleveland offices, along with utilizing the station's web provider to create a more state-of-the-art website presence for the latter stations under WLKN's existing Internet technology agreement. Beyond usual staff turnover, WLKN's programming format, which is female orientated and schedule have remained unchanged since the sale, though overflow local high school basketball games are carried on WLKN, especially during the playoff season. Since the WLKN conversion the station airs an all-Christmas music format through the holidays from Thanksgiving Day to December 26.
At the end of 2013, WLKN allowed a new Two Rivers-licensed station, WEMP (98.9), to undergo a one-day program test authority period using their studios and transmitter in order to maintain the license. This arrangement eventually had WEMP launch full operations in December 2014, using the WLKN tower to host their transmitter, along with leasing studio space in the basement of WLKN's facility and access to WLKN's post office box to launch the station with their assistance. WEMP was run by its owner, Mark Heller until he sold the station in August 2015 to Seehafer, and the operations for the station were moved to the WOMT/WQTC facilities on Mangin Street in Manitowoc. Seehafer also purchased WCUB and WLTU-FM, after closing on the WEMP purchase. WLKN's operations were moved to the Mangin facility in November 2016, ending 30 years of operation direct from Cleveland.
Programming
Notable programming includes syndicated evening host Delilah, and the Sunday morning "Dave Koz Radio Show", home improvement tips from Chicago-based do-it-yourself expert Lou Manfredini, The Lou Dobbs Financial Report from the Salem Radio Network, and the Saturday morning Shopping Spree program, which features half-off deals from local merchants and was brought over by former program director Barry Hersch to fill the need for such a program after his former station, WHBL canceled the program in the late 1990s under the title Name Your Price as brokered weekend syndicated programming became popular.
The station is managed by Dave Jetzer. The station is voicetracked by local personalities for shifts outside of the station's morning show, hosted by Sandi Davis.

He recorded and released his first album Fidjo Malguado in 1978, an instrumental work that relieves its virtuosity with a guitarist. At 19 years of age, Tito Paris later moved to Lisbon under the request by Bana, he wanted to play the bass guitar. In Portugal, he took part of the band named Os Gaiatos in 1980 and recorded in Portugal as an exile band from 1982 to 1985.

In 1996, he recorded his third album Graça de Tchega. Afterwards, he released two live albums, one about B. Leza in 1998 and the other was recorded on 27 July 1990, released in 1999. In 2002, he released his new album Guilhermina, his two Acústico albums were released, the first was Aula Magna released in 2004 which was the African edition and the second was the African edition in 2007. His recent album is titled Mozamverde which featured tracks with musical styles of Cape Verde and Mozambique. Most of the albums were released on the Paris-based record company Lusafrica.
He paid tribute to Miguel Portas at Teatros Luiz in Lisbon, where he sang a song titled "Sodade", originally sung by Cesária Évora. As a composer, he also wrote songs for Bana and Cesária Evora.
Tito Paris has toured numerous nations including Portugal, Spain, France especially Cannes, New York City and Boston in the United States, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Brussels in Belgium and Norway.
In 2012, he celebrated 30 years of his career, with a huge concert in Rotterdam with the Metropolitan Orchestra of the Netherlands, a launch of a photobiography together with a documentary.
On 8 April 2017, he was awarded the rank of the Commander of the Portuguese Order of Merit by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa Not long after, he released a new album titled Mim ê Bô, which features with the special presentation of the former King of Morna Bana, as well as Boss AC and the Brazilian musician Zeca Baleiro.

Aron John Baynes (born 9 December 1986) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Brisbane Bullets of the National Basketball League (NBL). He played college basketball for Washington State University before starting his professional career in Europe. In 2013, he joined the San Antonio Spurs, and a year later, won an NBA championship with the Spurs. He has also played with the Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, and Phoenix Suns. Baynes also plays for the Australian national team.
Early life
Baynes was born in Gisborne, New Zealand to New Zealand parents in 1986. His family moved to the relatively small Australian town of Mareeba, Queensland when he was three years of age. He grew up playing rugby league in Far North Queensland while attending Mareeba State High School until the age of 15 when his older brother, Callum, introduced him to basketball. As a result, Baynes decided to focus on pursuing a career in basketball and subsequently quit rugby league. Shortly after high school graduation, he joined the Australian Institute of Sport in 2004–05 and accepted a college scholarship offer from Tony Bennett to play for Washington State University in 2006. During his college career under Bennett, Washington State tied the school wins record twice consecutively, going 26–8 in 2006–07 and 26–9 in 2007–08.
Professional career
Europe (2009–2013)
On 29 May 2009, Baynes signed a two-year deal with Lietuvos Rytas of the Lithuanian Basketball League. In July 2009, he played for the Los Angeles Lakers' Summer League team. Following the 2009–10 season, he parted ways with Lietuvos Rytas.
On 15 July 2010, Baynes signed a two-year deal with EWE Baskets Oldenburg of the German Basketball Bundesliga. In 40 games for Oldenburg in 2010–11, he averaged 6.8 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. On 29 June 2011, he parted ways with Oldenburg.
On 24 August 2011, Baynes signed a one-year deal with Ikaros Kallitheas of the Greek Basket League.
On 1 August 2012, Baynes signed a one-year deal with Union Olimpija of the Slovenian Basketball League. On 5 January 2013, he played his final game for Olimpija, as he later left the team in pursuit of an NBA contract.
San Antonio Spurs (2013–2015)
On 23 January 2013, Baynes signed with the San Antonio Spurs. In his second NBA game, Baynes recorded seven points, nine rebounds and one block in a 102–78 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. During the 2012–13 season, he was assigned multiple times to the Austin Toros of the NBA Development League. He made his first NBA start in Game 4 of the Spurs' first-round playoff match-up against the Los Angeles Lakers, and was tasked with defending Dwight Howard. The Spurs went on to reach the 2013 NBA Finals but lost the series in seven games to the Miami Heat.
On 1 December 2013, Baynes was reassigned to the Austin Toros. He was recalled on 2 December, reassigned on 8 December, and recalled again on 9 December. On 6 May 2014, he recorded playoff career-high numbers of 10 points and seven rebounds in a 116–92 win over the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 1 of the Western Conference semi-finals. Baynes went on to help the Spurs defeat the Miami Heat 4–1 in the 2014 NBA Finals to claim his first NBA championship.
On 26 September 2014, Baynes re-signed with the Spurs. On 20 December 2014, he scored a then career-high 16 points while starting in place of Tim Duncan in a 99–93 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. On 1 April 2015 and 3 April 2015, Baynes had back-to-back 18-point games.
Detroit Pistons (2015–2017)
On 12 July 2015, Baynes signed with the Detroit Pistons. On 19 March 2016, he scored a career-high 21 points in a 115–103 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
On 14 November 2016, Baynes scored 20 points against the Oklahoma City Thunder while starting in place of Andre Drummond. On 19 March 2017, Baynes grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds alongside 13 points in a 112–95 win over the Phoenix Suns.
Boston Celtics (2017–2019)
On 19 July 2017, Baynes signed with the Boston Celtics. In a game against the Charlotte Hornets, Baynes injured Celtics teammate and star point guard Kyrie Irving. On 8 November 2017, he matched his career high with 21 points in a 107–96 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. In the Celtics' regular season finale on 11 April 2018, Baynes led a short-handed Boston lineup with a career-best 26 points and 14 rebounds in a 110–97 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
On 7 July 2018, Baynes re-signed with the Celtics. On 19 December 2018, in a 111–103 loss to the Phoenix Suns, Baynes broke a bone in his left hand. He was subsequently ruled out for four to six weeks. He returned to action on 16 January 2019 against the Toronto Raptors. On 3 February, he was sidelined with a left foot contusion.
Phoenix Suns (2019–2020)
On 6 July 2019, Baynes, along with the draft rights to Ty Jerome, was traded to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 protected first-round pick. After Deandre Ayton was suspended for 25 games due to diuretic usage on 24 October, Baynes was promoted to being the team's starting center during that period of time. On 30 October, Baynes recorded 24 points, 12 rebounds, and a career-high 7 assists in a 121–110 win over the Golden State Warriors. On 6 March 2020, Baynes scored 37 points and hit nine three-pointers, both career-highs, along with 16 rebounds, in a 127–117 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. He not only tied a franchise record for most three-pointers made in a single game, but he also joins James Harden as the only other player to record 35+ points, 15+ rebounds, and 9 three-pointers in a single game.
On 23 June 2020, the Suns reported that two of their own players tested positive for COVID-19. In an interview on 22 July, Baynes revealed himself as one of the two players to test positive for COVID-19. Unlike his other teammate that tested positive, Baynes did rejoin the team in the 2020 NBA Bubble until after the scrimmage games were finished, making sure he completely tested negative for the virus before entering the bubble. Because of his late entry and subsequent quarantine period, he was not able to play on 31 July against the Washington Wizards. After recovering from the virus, Baynes was later diagnosed with a right knee contusion, leaving him out of action for the rest of the resumed regular season. Despite being out of action for most of the game, Baynes was considered clear to play for the team's last game of the season, but decided against it despite the blowout 128–102 win over the Dallas Mavericks, ending the resumed season with an 8–0 record.
Toronto Raptors (2020–2021)
On 25 November 2020, the Toronto Raptors signed Baynes to a multi-year contract. On 31 January 2021, Baynes had eight points and a season-high 16 rebounds in a 115–102 win against the Orlando Magic. On 4 August 2021, he was waived by the Raptors.
Brisbane Bullets (2022–present)
After suffering a career-threatening spinal cord injury during the Tokyo Olympics, Baynes returned to professional basketball by signing a two-year deal with the Brisbane Bullets of the National Basketball League on 28 July 2022.
National team career
Baynes has played for the Australian national team, the Boomers, at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey, the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain, the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China. Baynes was also part of the national team for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but a spinal cord injury ruled him out for the second half of the tournament as the Boomers went on to win the bronze medal.
Baynes' injury at the Tokyo Olympics was much more serious than had initially been reported, and as of January 2022, he was still recovering with hopes of returning to the NBA.

Irbis Shekui Khagan (full title: Yǐpíshèkuìkĕhàn 乙毗射匮可汗) (r. 642–651) was the penultimate ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate.
He was linked to the Nushibi faction and was son of El Kulug Shad.
Reign
In 642, he overthrew Yukuk Shad (r. 638–642) with support from the expanding Tang dynasty Chinese. Although Yukuk Shad was still active and controlling a part of the territory, Irbis Shekui had the support of Nushibi (western) tribes. During the early years of his reign the rivalry between the Nushibi and Dulu factions cooled off.
In 646, he sought a Chinese princess for his bride. In return, Emperor Taizong of Tang demanded the return of several Tarim Basin cities. When this was refused the Chinese invaded the Tarim. Two years later several Dulu leaders took refuge in China. With them the khaganate also lost Dzungaria to China.
Later in his reign, Ashina Helu rebelled against him in 646, but was defeated. In 651 he was overthrown by Ashina Helu who was supported by the Dulu faction and Tang China now.

HP CloudSystem is now branded HP Helion CloudSystem and is an integral component of the HP Helion portfolio.
Cloud migration challenges
The migration of traditional IT, in which IT directly controls IT purchasing, deployment, management, and use, to a cloud computing model holds a number of challenges. A paper titled "Cloud Migration: A Case Study of Migrating an Enterprise IT System to IaaS," by researchers at the Cloud Computing Co-laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews, raises several socio-technical issues related to the migration of IT services to the cloud. The researchers state that in-house IT personnel are at risk of becoming dependent upon the cloud service vendor, of which the user organization has no control over. The researchers also note that the user organization could also require more resources to carry out migration to the cloud and overcome the issues that could crop up after migration, such as a lack of in-house knowledge of cloud operations.
The researchers also note that the user organization's customer representatives could take longer to resolve customer problems, as their questions may require input from the external cloud services provider. Furthermore, migrating to cloud computing could reduce job satisfaction among IT staffers, whose jobs change from a hands-on technical role to managing external service providers. User organizations must also learn to cope with a new way of managing IT as they are no longer in charge of software support contracts or hardware maintenance issues.
Other cloud migration challenges that have been cited include security, vendor management and technical integration. Security experts have raised the issue that because public clouds are multi-tenant (see: Multitenancy), meaning that the cloud provider hosts data from many different user organizations, opening up security risks. Vulnerabilities or defects in one organization's applications could negatively affect other applications hosted by the same service provider.
Under the vendor management issue, user organizations must also take responsibility of ensuring different cloud providers meet their Service-level agreements. User organizations must identify what is required to integrate the cloud service with their existing IT infrastructure. The user organization may need to create a virtual machine template that describes the infrastructure, application and the security that's required of the service provider.
Dan Kusnetzky, cloud computing analyst at research firm the 451 group cites resistance to change as an inhibitor to cloud computing. He is quoted as saying: "Basically, IT people are charged with keeping the status quo, because the possibility for changes introduces the chances that things will stop working." HP's Cloud Discovery Workshop and HP Cloud Roadmap Services has been described as created to address these concerns. The workshops aim to educate user organizations about the impact of cloud computing to company culture. The opportunities and risks of cloud computing are also discussed. The roadmap service is offered as an addition to the discovery workshop. It aims to help organizations plan and adopt cloud computing.
CloudSystem environments and characteristics
Cloud Service Automation Software
CloudSystem includes HP Cloud Service Automation Software, a set of system management tools used to provide and manage the lifecycle of IT services. That is done in an automated way. Cloud Service Automation Software is based on technology from a company acquired by HP in 2007 called Opsware. The tools that are part of CSA manage the following cloud tasks: workflow, configuration, provisioning, management and monitoring.
Lauren Nelson, an analyst with industry research company Forrester Research has been cited as describing CSA as offering tools to create a cloud that would be similar to Amazon Web Services or Rackspace Cloud from a collection of servers.
CloudSystem Matrix
Industry analyst company Illuminata has described CloudSystem Matrix as a "coordinated system for setting up pools of modular resources and flexibly deploying IT services across those pools."
HP CloudSystem Matrix is a platform for private clouds. It has been described as helping to shorten the time it takes for user organizations to deliver complex applications and IT infrastructures.
HP CloudSystem Matrix 7.0 cloud automation environment was launched in November 2011. It includes pre-integrated server, network, storage and software components. This version also includes cloud bursting capabilities and automated self-provisioning.
Judith Hurwitz, a widely recognized industry analyst described CloudSystem Matrix as a linchpin of HP's cloud strategy. She has described CloudSystem Matrix as a unified computing system that combines virtual and physical server blades. A central console is used to manage resource pools, physical and virtual servers and network connectivity. Among the virtualization hypervisors supported are VMware, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V, Hurwitz writes in her article.
The engine of CloudSystem Matrix is the Matrix Operating Environment, which manages, monitors and provisions servers for physical and virtual resources. Matrix OE also carries out network management. It is an infrastructure lifecycle management software that enables users to provision and modify complex infrastructures according to dynamic business demands.
CloudSystem Matrix includes HP Cloud Maps, a set of templates to assist user organizations to architect cloud computing infrastructures to deliver applications and services. HP Cloud Maps templates are pre-configured to include workflow and deployment scripts for cloud services. Cloud Maps have also been described as pre-configured templates for creating application stacks. These stacks could include workflows or third-party applications from Microsoft, SAP and Oracle to be delivered as cloud services. The templates can be loaded into CloudSystem to create a cloud services catalog. HP has been cited as describing Cloud Maps as reducing the time it takes to provision cloud services by 80%, and to reduce the time it takes for compliance management by up to 75%.
HP CloudStart
HP CloudStart enables user organizations to design, build and install a private cloud based on CloudSystem Matrix. CloudStart includes Cloud Service Automation and a virtual infrastructure provisioning product that features a self-service portal. It also provides resource metering and chargeback facilities for private clouds. IT services are also included with CloudStart, including an assessment of the user organization's existing IT infrastructure plus recommendations for how the organization could use cloud computing. The cloud configuration is set up by HP, which also moves the defined services to the cloud. Training is also provided to the user organization. HP has been cited as saying that it can create a private cloud for user organizations within 30 days of its initial engagement with the organization.
Cloud orchestration
Cloud computing disperses applications and services among multiple servers and, in some cases, multiple data centers. Cloud orchestration coordinates the different cloud elements to ensure systems and applications management, integration, support, billing, provisioning, service-level agreement management and contract management. Cloud orchestration is a part of CloudSystem and the feature is based on Opsware Workflow, a centralized console for provisioning and server and patch management.
CloudSystem Enterprise
CloudSystem Enterprise provides a single environment for the creation and management of private clouds. Based on Cloud Service Automation, CloudSystem Enterprise manages private clouds running on standalone physical servers, and hybrid clouds running across private and public clouds. CloudSystem Enterprise includes a lifecycle management tool to manage the deployment and retirement of applications and infrastructure.
HP CloudSystem Service Provider
CloudSystem Service Provider is a platform for service providers to deliver public and virtual hosted private cloud services. It is aimed at service providers building Private clouds or Public clouds for Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service, or software-as-a-service. CloudSystem can be used by service providers to provide cloud services on carrier-level networks and IT infrastructures. It also allows service providers to automate and provision cloud services.
Cloud bursting
In November 2011, HP announced a cloud bursting feature for CloudSystem. This feature enables CloudSystem to use the capacity of external private and public clouds when demand increases.
CloudSystem includes other software. This includes HP TippingPoint, which provides intrusion detection, network security and traffic management. CloudSystem is based on templates called CloudMaps that provide common enterprise application stacks. Compliance is provided by HP ArcSight.
Third-party support
CloudSystem is supported by a partner program, which helps cloud computing services vendors to build Cloud Centers of Excellence. These have been described as demonstration clouds for HP CloudSystem and HP Converged Systems platforms. The centers can include products from HP Networking, HP TippingPoint and HP 3PAR storage.
Certified HP partners are also able to offer HP workshops, such as the HP Cloud Discovery Workshops and other training support. The Cloud Discovery Workshop is designed to educate attendees about cloud computing and helps attendees establish how cloud computing fits into their organizations and discusses best practices.

This is a list of cover versions by notable music artists who have recorded one or more songs written and recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna. Many artists began covering her songs since her debut in the 1980s. These covers are in several different languages and genres, and some have received positive reviews from music critics and featured on record charts.
Gary Trust from Billboard commented in 2012, that "Madonna's songs have found a place atop a Billboard ranking even when she's not singing them (covers)", adding also that this reinforces that her music "continues to reign among each new generation". In regards being a source of numerous covers, Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy stated that "her influence has spread like a spider web into the wider (and weirder) world of music". Similarly, Guinness World Records listed Madonna as the most remixed and sampled act arguing that "is a testament to just how incredibly influential she is".
A subject of diverse listicles, media outlets such as Paste, StyleCaster, Rolling Stone, Digital Spy and Stereogum among others have created best-of lists covers of Madonna songs. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Robinson noticed several covers made by male musicians, including Marilyn Manson, Marc Almond, KMFDM and Teenage Fanclub. One of the most commercially releases, is the version of "Like a Prayer" by Mad'House, which marked the debut of the band and sold 2 million copies throughout Europe according to Dutch agent Jan Vis; in France alone, Charts in France reported sales of 326,000 copies as of 2014. Similarly, singers Kelly Osbourne ("Papa Don't Preach") and Cristina Scuccia ("Like a Virgin") made their musical debut covering a Madonna song.
Covers of Madonna's cover versions of songs by other artists – such as "Fever" by Little Willie John and "American Pie" by Don McLean – are not included in this list. This article does not contain the media appearances, namechecking and other cultural depictions of Madonna singles.

Kika is a 1993 black comedy film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar and starring Verónica Forqué as the title character. Forqué won the Goya Award for Best Actress, the second female lead on an Almodóvar film to do so.
Plot
Kika, a naïve make-up artist, recalls how she met her lover Ramón. She had given her phone number to his stepfather, American writer Nicholas Pierce, and he had called her not for sex as she had hoped, but to make up the younger man's corpse. He was, however, merely catatonic and suddenly awoke. Ramón is a fashion photographer with voyeuristic tendencies who was traumatised by his mother's suicide after several attempts. He lets Nicholas, who has returned to Madrid, live above their flat and the two discuss whether to sell the family home outside of town, Casa Youkali, which they jointly own. Ramón proposes to Kika, who accepts but feels conflicted as she has been cheating on him with Nicholas.
Nicholas is working on a novel about a lesbian serial killer, but he makes ends meet by freelancing discreetly for an outrageously exploitative television show which focuses on bizarre and macabre events. The show is devised and presented by Andrea Caracortada ("Andrea Scarface"), who wears over-the-top outfits and a persona to match. Andrea used to be a psychologist, and Ramón was once her patient, then her lover. He tells Nicholas that she scarred her own face when he left her and she is now stalking him.
On her show, Andrea reports that Paul Bazzo, a dim-witted sex maniac and former pornographic actor jailed for rapes, has escaped while attending a religious procession. He turns up at Ramón and Kika's flat because their maid Juana is his long-suffering sister. Juana instructs him to tie her up, knock her unconscious and steal valuables, then hide at a cousin's place. Paul, however, finds Kika napping and rapes her at knife point. An unseen voyeur peeping at Kika's room notifies the police and two incompetent inspectors eventually arrive, shoot up the door and with great difficulty interrupt the rape. Paul escapes and bumps into Andrea, kitted out in a futuristic reporter's outfit complete with helmet-mounted video camera. She asks for an interview, but he pushes her off and steals her motorcycle. She then enters the flat and harasses Kika. The police are puzzled at her presence, because although they often tip her off, they did not in this case. Andrea credits an unknown peeping tom for alerting her and broadcasts video footage of the rape on her show, causing Kika to break down.
In the aftermath, Kika finds Ramón to be no help and she overhears him confess to Nicholas that it was he who called the police: he liked to peep on her from his photographic studio's window. She leaves him in silence, as does a guilt-ridden Juana who confesses her part in the rape. Ramón also tells Nicholas that he has held on to his mother's diaries but never found the strength to read them. He does so, however, after Nicholas has moved back to Casa Youkali, and discovers that the farewell letter to him that Nicholas had passed on was actually ripped from an old entry. Ramón confronts Nicholas and accuses him of murdering his mother.
Meanwhile, it turns out that Andrea and Ramón both spied on the flat from separate addresses. While reviewing footage of the upper floor, Andrea realises that Nicholas appears to have murdered one of his several girlfriends, Susana, when she visited him. Connecting this to his latest book, she also goes to Casa Youkali armed with a pistol and finds a freshly dug grave in the garden. Nicholas barricades himself, but she breaks in aggressively and offers to interview him and let him run away before the broadcast. They fight and shoot each other. Kika also appears and Nicholas confesses with his dying breath that his novel about a lesbian serial killer is actually a disguised autobiography, as Andrea had figured out. Kika also finds the bodies of Andrea, Susana and Ramón, but she manages to resurrect the latter a second time with electric shocks. Ramón had gone into shock after finding Susana's body in the bathroom.
While Ramón is taken to hospital, Kika picks up a stranded driver and takes an instant interest in him, stating that she might need a new direction.

The Ennead or Great Ennead was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology worshipped at Heliopolis: the sun god Atum; his children Shu and Tefnut; their children Geb and Nut; and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. The Ennead sometimes includes the son of Osiris and Isis, Horus.
The Great Ennead was only one of several such groupings of nine deities in ancient Egypt. Its claims to preeminence by its Heliopolitan priests were not respected throughout Egypt. As close as Memphis (also within modern Cairo), the priests of Ptah celebrated him as superior to the Nine. In addition to Memphis having its own creation myth, the Ogdoad/Hermopolitan centered around physical creation and eight primordial gods was another creation story that existed at the same time.
Names
Ennead is a borrowing via Latin of the Greek name Enneás (), meaning "the Nine". The term was a calque of the Egyptian name, written and also meaning "the Nine". Its original pronunciation is uncertain, since hieroglyphs do not record vowels, but may have been in Old Egyptian, in Middle Egyptian, and in Late Egyptian. Egyptologists conventionally transcribe it as Pesedjet.
History
The ancient Egyptians created several enneads as their unification under Dynasty I brought numerous local cults into contact with one another. The ancient Egyptian mythology often had many different explanations for the same phenomenon. This concept is especially unique because no single story was more accurate than another, but rather the truth was a mix of them all. The Pyramid Texts of Dynasties V and VI mention the "Great Ennead", the "Lesser Ennead", the "Dual Ennead", and the "Seven Enneads". Some pharaohs established enneads that incorporated themselves as gods. The most notable case is Seti I of Dynasty XIX, whose temple at Redesiyah celebrated an ennead of six major gods and three deified forms of himself. In the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days, the ennead mentioned may reference the Pleiades.
The most important was the "Great" or "Heliopolitan Ennead" of Awanu (), known under the Greeks and Romans as Heliopolis. It celebrated the family of the sun god Atum (sometimes referred to as Atum-Re) and thrived from the Old Kingdom to the Ptolemaic period.
Its development remains uncertain, although it appears to have first appeared when Ra's cult—supreme under Dynasty V—declined in importance under Dynasty VI. Egyptologists have traditionally theorized that the Heliopolitan priesthood established it to establish the preeminence of Atum over the others, incorporating some major gods in lesser positions and omitting others entirely. The most prominent of such deities was Osiris, god of vegetation and the afterlife, who was incorporated into the Ennead as Atum's great-grandson. However, in the 20th century, some Egyptologists question the whole scenario. After the Great Ennead was well established, the cult of Ra—identified with Atum—recovered much of its importance until superseded by the cult of Horus. The two were then combined as Ra–Horus of the Horizons.
Myths
According to the creation story of the Heliopolitan priests, the world originally consisted of the primordial waters of precreation personified as Nun. From it arose a mound on the First Occasion. Upon the mound sat the self-begotten god Atum, who was equated with the sun god Ra. Atum evolved from Nun through self-creation. Atum either spat or masturbated, producing air personified as Shu and moisture personified as Tefnut. The siblings Shu and Tefnut mated to produce the earth personified as Geb and the nighttime sky personified as Nut.
Geb and Nut were the parents of Osiris and Isis and of Set and Nephthys, who became respective couples in turn. Osiris and Isis represent fertility and order, while Set and Nephthys represent chaos to balance out Osiris and Isis. Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis, is often included in this creation tradition. Due to the duality of Ancient Egyptian myths, this is only one of many creation stories. The Egyptians believed no specific myth was more correct than the other, rather that some combination of these myths was correct. This creation story, the Heliopolitan tradition, is one of physiological creation. The other major creation traditions are the Memphite Tradition and Hermopolitian/Ogdoad.

Cyclamen pseudibericum (incorrectly spelled pseudoibericum), the false Iberian cyclamen, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Cyclamen of the family Primulaceae, native to the Amanus or Nur and Anti-Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. It is an herbaceous, tuberous perennial growing to . It is similar to Cyclamen coum, but with longer petals.
Description
The tuber develops roots from the center below. The leaves are longer than wide, with a hastate or Christmas-tree pattern in green and silver. The spring-blooming flowers with five reflexed, upswept petals, are fragrant and magenta-purple or pink, with a darker blotch and a white zone at the end of the nose (larger than that of C. coum). After flowering, a pod develops on a coiled stem that rests on the ground, releasing its seeds directly on to the soil surface.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).
Subdivisions
Forms
There are two naturally occurring forms, distinguished by predominant flower color. C. pseudibericum f. pseudibericum is magenta-purple and C. pseudibericum f. roseum is light pink to nearly white.
Hybrids
Cyclamen × schwarzii Grey-Wilson is a fertile hybrid of Cyclamen pseudibericum × Cyclamen libanoticum. This hybrid can cross back with one of the parents. According to Grey-Wilson some very pale forms of C. pseudibericum f. roseum could actually be C. ×schwarzii or a back-cross of it.

James Franklin (born July 23, 1991) is an American former professional Canadian football quarterback. He played college football at Missouri. He was the Tigers' starting quarterback from 2011 to 2013. He was also a member of the Detroit Lions, Edmonton Eskimos, Toronto Argonauts, and Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Early years
Franklin attended Lake Dallas High School in Corinth, Texas.
He was rated the #4 Dual-Threat Quarterback in the country by Rivals.com.
|}
College career
As a freshman in 2010, Franklin was the backup to Blaine Gabbert. He played in 10 games, completing 11 of 14 passes for 106 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He also ran for 116 yards on 23 carries with two touchdowns. He became the starter in 2011 after Gabbert entered the 2011 NFL Draft.
As a sophomore in 2011, Franklin started all 13 games for Missouri, leading them to an 8–5 record. He completed 63.3% of his passes for 2865 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He also rushed 217 times for 981 yards and 15 touchdowns. Franklin led Missouri to a number of comeback victories, erasing a 14-point deficit against the Texas A&M Aggies and the Texas Tech Red Raiders, and a 10-point deficit against the Kansas Jayhawks. Franklin also led Missouri to its first win over the Texas Longhorns since 1997.
Franklin was named MVP of the 2011 Independence Bowl after leading Missouri to a 41–24 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, accounting for 274 total yards of offense and 3 touchdowns.
On March 19, 2012, it was announced that Franklin would have surgery on his throwing shoulder but he was expected to recover in time for the start of the regular season. He returned for the start of the season, but battled injuries throughout the season, appearing in only nine games. He finished the season with 1,562 passing yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions.
As a senior in 2013, Franklin appeared in 10 games, missing four due to injury. He finished the season with 2,429 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. In his final college game, he helped lead the Tigers to a victory in the 2014 Cotton Bowl.
Professional career
Detroit Lions
Franklin went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft. However, on May 10, 2014, the Detroit Lions signed Franklin to a rookie free-agent deal. On August 25, 2014, he was released.
Edmonton Eskimos
According to his Twitter account, Franklin signed in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Edmonton Eskimos on April 10, 2015. Franklin began the 2015 CFL season as the number 3 quarterback on the depth chart; behind Mike Reilly and Matt Nichols. In two preseason games, Franklin completed 26 of 40 pass attempts for 316 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. In his next two seasons in Edmonton, Franklin would only sparingly see action as he continued to back-up Mike Reilly. In three seasons with the club, Franklin attempted 176 passes, completing 116 of them for 1,449 yards with 12 touchdowns and only one interception.
Toronto Argonauts
On December 12, 2017, Franklin was traded by the Eskimos (along with a 2018 third round pick) to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for national offensive lineman Mason Woods. Franklin was a pending free agent and needed to be re-signed by the Argos prior to February 13, 2018; which the Argos accomplished on January 5, 2018 when they signed him to a two-year deal. Franklin was brought in by the Argos to be an understudy to veteran quarterback Ricky Ray for his final season, before taking the reins in 2019: However, Ray suffered a spinal injury in Week 2, ending his season (and possibly his career), accelerating the Argos timeline with Franklin making him the starting quarterback in Week 3. Nevertheless, after a poor performance in Week 7 Franklin was demoted to backup quarterback behind McLeod Bethel-Thompson. Bethel-Thompson won his first two starts, but was ultimately unable to lead the Argos to the playoffs, and with the team eliminated Franklin returned to the starting role in Week 18. Both quarterbacks finished with the same starting record of 2-6 as the Argos limped to a 4-14 last place finish. As a short yardage quarterback, Franklin tied a CFL record held by Doug Flutie of most rushing touchdowns in a season, with 14.
Franklin began the 2019 season as the Argos' starting quarterback, but suffered a hamstring injury in the team's Week 3 loss to the Roughriders and was subsequently placed on the six-game injured reserve list. He was announced as the team' starting quarterback again after Week 15 as the club fell to a record of 2-10. Franklin started the next two games for the Argos, but was unable to lead them to victory in either outing and was demoted to back-up quarterback behind McLeod Bethel-Thompson. The Argos re-signed McLeod Bethel-Thompson on February 4, 2020 and signed veteran quarterback Matt Nichols on February 7, 2020, and subsequently released Franklin later that same day.
Saskatchewan Roughriders
Franklin signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders on February 11, 2020. He signed a one-year contract extension with the team on January 12, 2021. The team announced his retirement on April 9, 2021.

A Place in the Stars is a 2014 Nigerian crime thriller film written by Ita Hozaife and J. K. Amalou, co-produced and directed by Steve Gukas. It stars Gideon Okeke, Segun Arinze, Matilda Obaseki, Yemi Blaq, Femi Branch and Dejumo Lewis. The film was inspired by the tenure of Late Professor Dora Akunyili as the Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).
The film is set in 2006, and narrates the story of Kim Dakim (Gideon Okeke), a young lawyer who has information about the trafficking of counterfeit drugs and stands to make millions of dollars if he doesn't pass on the information. However, the drug baron, Diokpa Okonkwo (Segun Arinze) is ready to kill in order protect his thriving illegal trade and Kim has him to contend with, while battling with his conscience and everything he has been raised to believe is right.

Production
A Place in the Stars focuses on "how fake and adulterated medical drugs are being traded for billions of dollars". Gukas decided to make a film on fake drugs, having been inspired by the tenure of the now late Dora Akunyili as the Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). According to him, the zeal and dedication of Akinyili helped a lot to reduce the prevalence of fake drugs in Nigeria to a minimum level at the time.
The film which was partly funded by Nigeria's National Film and Video Censors Board, is a co-production of Native Filmworks with Jungle FilmWorks, Massive Entertainment, Consolidated Media Associates, Pepper Fruit Consult, MichelAngelo Productions and T-Large Media. According to Gukas, the total amount spent on producing the film is over a million dollars. It was shot in Jos, Abuja and Lagos. The film's development through production took a period of five years. The director noted the funding style as the reason behind the long duration.
Music and soundtrack
The music was composed by George Kallis; Instrumentation for the music composition was done by a ninety-piece orchestra and it was recorded in Budapest, Hungary. The music score is majorly of an uplifting tempo. The theme song for the film "A Place in the Stars" by Jeremiah Gyang of Chocolate City music label was released on 21 September 2014, along with its music video.
Promotion and release
The film was officially announced to the press on 20 August 2014 at Freedom Park, Lagos Island. The official trailer for the film was unveiled at the event, before it was uploaded on YouTube the same day. Exclusive behind-the-scenes footage; including the making of the film, the music score and music video of the film's soundtrack were also screened for guests at the event. On 1 October, a social media campaign was launched on Twitter, which involves users, including celebrities, twitting the name of people who they think deserve a place in the stars, with the hash-tag "#APlaceInTheStars". A private screening was held for the film at the Four Points Sheraton Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos on 12 October 2014. The film premiered on 7 November 2014 at Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos, and slated for a general release on 14 November.
Reception
Critical reception
The films received generally negative critical reviews. Wilfred Okiche of YNaija says A Place in the Stars is "a disappointing film", faulting almost everything in it. He cited Gideon Okeke as an unengaging leading man, says the screenplay is not dramatic enough, and concludes : "Any director would have presented A Place in the stars in this way and it would be terrible. But Gukas, whose profile is enough to inspire certain lofty expectations, proceeds with this effort, to dash every single one of them. Nothing inspiring, entertaining or admirable about this [film]". Oris Aigbokhaevbolo of "True Nollywood Stories" gave 5.4 stars, also generally panning the film and Okeke's performance, but commended its motive. He concludes: "Okeke's smug-plated acting aside, this is the trouble with A Place in the Stars: it is an NGO enlightenment campaign for television. Screenwriter Ita Hozaife's and J.K Amalou's hearts are in the right place, but their film is showing at the wrong space".
Amarachukwu Iwuala of 360Nobs criticized the scripting and continuity, but commended the music, commenting "The orchestra is so solemn that one is forced into sober reflections. The technical quality of the film is topnotch whilst many of the actors give sublime performances. [However,] A Place in the Stars is not exceptional, coming from the director of Keeping Faith. Ukamaka of Olisa TV says the film seems like a documentary, which is overwhelmed by the beautiful cinematography; she concludes: "Though A Place In The Stars subscribes to a standard all its own, which is a triumph, it could have been better if the story wasn't so linear [...] But A Place in the Stars stands tall among its peers; daring to pull off impressive stunts and starting an important conversation".
Accolades
A Place in the Stars was nominated in eleven categories at the 2015 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards, and won the award for "Best Drama Film".

In the fictional Star Trek universe, the Rules of Acquisition are a collection of sacred business proverbs of the ultra-capitalist race known as the Ferengi.
The first mention of rules in the Star Trek universe was in "The Nagus", an episode of the TV series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 1, Episode 10). In a later Deep Space Nine episode, "The Maquis: Part 1", Sakonna (a Vulcan) asks Quark (a Ferengi) to explain what a Rule of Acquisition is. He states, "Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by 285 Rules of Acquisition to ensure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned... well most of them anyway."
Background
The first Rule was made by Gint, the first Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, a role with political, economic, and even quasi-religious duties. The Rules were said to be divinely inspired and sacred (thus furthering the original marketing ploy.)
Although it has been stated within Star Trek that there are 285 Rules, not all of them have been stated in canon. Most of the Rules were written by Ira Steven Behr, a writer for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, in a book The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition (). The book's cover credits authorship as being "By Quark as told to Ira Steven Behr." Additional rules were published in Legends of the Ferengi () by Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe, another writer for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine when Behr was the executive producer of the series.
The Star Trek: Voyager episode "False Profits" mentions a book containing all of the Rules:

Indirect injection in an internal combustion engine is fuel injection where fuel is not directly injected into the combustion chamber.
Gasoline engines equipped with indirect injection systems, wherein a fuel injector delivers the fuel at some point before the intake valve, have mostly fallen out of favor to direct injection. However, certain manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford have developed a 'dual injection' system, combining direct injectors with port (indirect) injectors, combining the benefits of both types of fuel injection. Direct injection allows the fuel to be precisely metered into the combustion chamber under high pressure which can lead to greater power, fuel efficiency. The issue with direct injection is that it typically leads to greater amounts of particulate matter and with the fuel no longer contacting the intake valves, carbon can accumulate on the intake valves over time. Adding indirect injection keeps fuel spraying on the intake valves, reducing or eliminating the carbon accumulation on intake valves and in low load conditions, indirect injection allows for better fuel-air mixing. This system is mainly used in higher cost models due to the added expense and complexity.
Port injection refers to the spraying of the fuel onto the back of the intake valve, which speeds its evaporation.
An indirect injection diesel engine delivers fuel into a chamber off the combustion chamber, either a prechamber or swirl chamber, where combustion begins and then spreads into the main combustion chamber. The prechamber is carefully designed to ensure adequate mixing of the atomized fuel with the compression-heated air.
Gasoline engines
An advantage of indirect injection gasoline engines versus direct injection gasoline engines is that deposits on intake valves from the crankcase ventilation system are washed by the fuel. Indirect injection engines also tend to produce lower amounts of particulate matter compared to direct injection engines as the fuel and air are more uniformly mixed.
Diesel engines
Overview
The purpose of the divided combustion chamber is to speed the combustion process, and to increase power output by increasing engine speed. The addition of a prechamber increases heat loss to the cooling system and thereby lowers engine efficiency. The engine requires glow plugs for starting. In an indirect injection system the air moves fast, mixing the fuel and air. This simplifies engine (piston crown, head, valves, injector, prechamber, etc.) design and allows the use less tightly toleranced designs which are simpler to manufacture and more reliable. Direct injection, by contrast, uses slow-moving air and fast-moving fuel; both the design and manufacture of the injectors is more difficult. The optimisation of the in-cylinder air flow is much more difficult than designing a prechamber. There is much more integration between the design of the injector and the engine. It is for this reason that car diesel engines were almost all indirect injection until the ready availability of powerful CFD simulation systems made the adoption of direct injection practical.

Classification of indirect combustion chambers
Swirl chamber
Swirl chambers are spherical cavities located in the cylinder head and separated from the engine cylinder by a tangential throat. About 50% of the air enters the swirl chamber during the compression stroke of the engine, producing a swirl.
After combustion, the products return through the same throat to the main cylinder at much higher velocity, so more heat is lost to the walls of the passage. This type of chamber finds application in engines in which fuel control and engine stability are more important than fuel economy. These are also called Ricardo chambers, named after the inventor, Sir Harry Ricardo.
Precombustion chamber
This chamber is located at the cylinder head and is connected to the engine cylinder by small holes. It occupies 40% of the total cylinder volume. During the compression stroke, air from the main cylinder enters the precombustion chamber. At this moment, fuel is injected into the precombustion chamber and combustion begins. Pressure increases and the fuel droplets are forced through the small holes into the main cylinder, resulting in a very good mix of the fuel and air. The bulk of the combustion actually takes place in the main cylinder. This type of combustion chamber has multi-fuel capability because the temperature of the prechamber vaporizes the fuel before the main combustion event occurs.
Air cell chamber
The air cell is a small cylindrical chamber with a hole in one end. It is mounted more or less coaxially with the injector, said axis being parallel to the piston crown, with the injector firing across a small cavity which is open to the cylinder into the hole in the end of the air cell. The air cell is mounted so as to minimise thermal contact with the mass of the head. A pintle injector with a narrow spray pattern is used. At its top dead centre (TDC) the majority of the charge mass is contained in the cavity and air cell.
When the injector fires, the jet of fuel enters the air cell and ignites. This results in a jet of flame shooting back out of the air cell directly into the jet of fuel still issuing from the injector. The heat and turbulence give excellent fuel vaporisation and mixing properties. Also since the majority of the combustion takes place outside the air cell in the cavity, which communicates directly with the cylinder, there is less heat loss involved in transferring the burning charge into the cylinder.
Air cell injection can be considered as a compromise between indirect and direct injection, gaining some of the efficiency advantages of direct injection while retaining the simplicity and ease of development of indirect injection.
Air cell chambers are commonly named Lanova air chambers. The Lanova combustion system was developed by the Lanova company, which was founded in 1929 by Franz Lang, Gotthard Wielich and Albert Wielich.
In the US, the Lanova system was used by Mack Trucks. An example is the Mack-Lanova ED diesel engine fitted to the Mack NR truck.
Advantages of indirect injection combustion chambers
Smaller diesels can be produced.
The injection pressure required is low, so the injector is cheaper to produce.
The injection direction is of less importance.
Indirect injection is much simpler to design and manufacture, especially for gasoline engines. Less injector development is required and the injection pressures are low (1500 psi/100 bar versus 5000 psi/345 bar and higher for direct injection)
The lower stresses that indirect injection imposes on internal components mean that it is possible to produce petrol and indirect injection diesel versions of the same basic engine. At best such types differed only in the cylinder head and the need to fit a distributor and spark plugs in the petrol version whilst fitting an injection pump and injectors to the diesel. Examples include the BMC A-Series and B-Series engines and the Land Rover 2.25/2.5-litre 4-cylinder types. Such designs allow petrol and diesel versions of the same vehicle to be built with minimal design changes between them.
Higher engine speeds can be reached, since burning continues in the prechamber.
Alternative fuels like bio-diesel and waste vegetable oil are less likely to damage the fuel system in an indirect-injection diesel engine, as high injection pressures are not needed. In direct-injection engines (especially modern engines using high-pressure common rail fuel systems), keeping fuel filters in good condition is more critical as debris can damage the pumps and injectors when waste vegetable oil or waste engine oil are used.
Disadvantages
Fuel efficiency with diesel engines is lower than with direct injection as the larger exposed areas tend to dissipate more heat and the air moving through the ports tending to increase pressure drops. However, using higher compression ratios will somewhat negate this inefficiency.
Glow plugs are needed for a cold engine start on diesel engines; many indirect injection diesel engines cannot start at all in cold weather without glow plugs.
Because the heat and pressure of combustion is applied to a very small area on the piston as it exits the precombustion chamber or swirl chamber, such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging, supercharging, or tuning) than direct injection diesels. The increased temperature and pressure on one part of the piston crown causes uneven expansion which can lead to cracking, distortion, or other damage, although advancements in manufacturing techniques have allowed manufacturers to largely mitigate the effects of uneven expansion, allowing for indirect injection diesels to use turbocharging.
Indirect engines are often much noisier than direct injection common-rail engines.
Starting fluid ("ether") often cannot be used in an indirect injection diesel engine as the glow plugs greatly increase the risk of preignition compared to direct injection diesels.

Elater ferrugineus, the rusty click beetle, is a species of click beetle belonging to the family Elateridae.
Varietas
Varietas include:
Elater ferrugineus var. morio Schilsky, 1888
Elater ferrugineus var. occitanicus de Villers, 1789
Distribution
This species is widespread in the Western Palearctic realm.
Description
Elater ferrugineus can reach a length of . This species is rather variable. Head is dark brown. Pronotum and elytra of males are usually bright orange or reddish, while females show a uniform dark brown color and are smaller than males. The legs are black. The antennae are mid-brown to black. In males they extend up to the posterior edge of the pronotum, while in females they are shorter.
Biology
Larvae develop in hole of ancient trees of various species, mainly oak (Quercus robur), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and elm (Ulmus spp.). The life cycle lasts 4–6 years. Pupation occurs in spring. These larvae are predatory. They especially prey on hermit beetle (Osmoderma eremita) and rose chafer (Cetonia aurata).
When male E. ferrugineus are attracted to a female, they release compounds that attract other males to the site. These compounds include geranyl, nerylacetone and 6-methyl-5-heptene-2-one. Attraction of males only occurs in the presence of females, ensuring increased mating opportunities.

Riverstone Holdings is a multinational private equity firm based in New York City focused on leveraged buyout, growth capital, and credit investments in the energy industry and electrical power industry sectors. The firm focuses on oil and gas exploration, midstream pipelines, electricity generation, energy and power services, energy and power technology, and renewable energy infrastructure and technology. Riverstone has raised approximately $41 billion since the firm's inception in 2000.
History
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City.
Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.
Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.
Then in 2013, Riverstone (operating without Carlyle) raised $7.7 billion for its fifth main energy fund, Riverstone Global Power & Energy Fund V.
In 2016, Riverstone raised $5.1 billion for its sixth main energy fund, Riverstone Global Power & Energy Fund VI.
Also in 2016, Riverstone raised its first flagship credit fund. In 2018 Riverstone raised $750 million for its second credit fund.
In October 2020 Riverstone's Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq: DCRB) priced a $200 million IPO. In February 2021, Riverstone's Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation II (Nasdaq: DCRN) priced a $350 million IPO.
Operations
As of 2020, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy, two credit funds, and a renewables investing platform with approximately $41 billion of total raised capital. It also manages Riverstone Energy, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Green/Environmental initiatives
In June 2009, Riverstone/Carlyle acquired renewable energy company Pattern Energy Group LP, representing Riverstone's 10th transaction in the Renewable Energy Sector. Pattern Energy is one of the world's largest private renewable energy companies, with large operating and development footprints in the United States, Canada, and Japan.
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers.
The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, a developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid. In July 2020, Enviva Holdings, LP successfully completed a recapitalization with more than $1 billion of new equity contributions and incremental equity commitments from affiliates of Riverstone.
In January 2021, Riverstone made a commitment to FreeWire Technologies, in electric vehicle (EV) charging and power. Also in January, Riverstone Energy Limited announced an investment of $25 million in Loanpal, LLC, a sustainable home improvement fintech provider used in over half of U.S. residential solar system sales.
In February 2021, Riverstone published their second annual ESG report detailing their commitment to ESG and responsible investing.

The Rumba Kings is an original American world music band co-founded in 2015 in Seattle, Washington, by producer/songwriter/bassist and former Capitol Records recording artist, Johnny Bacolas,(best known for being a member of the band Second Coming),
and guitarist/songwriter, George Stevens. The songwriting is strongly influenced by Latin and Mediterranean music, and is mostly nylon-guitar driven, influenced by such artists as Yanni and The Gipsy Kings.Regarding the band's songs, Stevens states, "If it isn't beautiful, it doesn't make the cut," while Bacolas describes the band's music as "passionate and beautiful."
In 2018, the band released their debut double-album, The Instrumental and Vocal Sessions, Vol. I, and in 2019, released their sophomore full-length album, The Instrumental Sessions, Vol. II.Subsequently, the band released three singles in 2020.
History (2015–present)
In June 2015, Bacolas and Stevens formed The Rumba Kings. Bacolas and Stevens began collaborating in the studio for the next two years writing their debut album. Soon after Bacolas and Stevens formed a live band from musicians they both knew. In April 2016, the group began performing live at local small bars and bistros.
In 2018, band released their debut double-disc debut album The Instrumental and Vocal Sessions, Vol. I. The album was produced by Johnny Bacolas and mixed and mastered by Martin Feveyear. In 2019, the group released their sophomore full-length album, The Instrumental Sessions, Vol. II. The album was also produced by Johnny Bacolas and mixed and mastered by Martin Feveyear.
During the production of both records, Bacolas traveled to Greece on two occasions, to record several musicians on songs for The Rumba Kings' albums, and to film and direct music videos for the band's new albums. Filming for the music videos took place on location on Mykonos, Santorini, and as well as throughout the mainland of Greece.In a November 1998 interview in The National Herald, Bacolas states, "My ultimate dream is to build a small villa in Santorini with a recording studio."
The group released their Latin single, "Mirame", written by Horacio Alcantar (Lyrics), and George Stevens (Music), and produced by Johnny Bacolas in January 2020. Natalis is the featured vocalist.
The Rumba Kings released their Greek single "Den tha se ksehaso", written by Sofi Alexandrou (Lyrics), George Stevens (Music), and John Paul Adams (Lyrics/Music), and produced by Johnny Bacolas in July 2020. Also in July 2020, the band released their Latin single "Dance with me", written by Johnny Bacolas (Lyrics), and George Stevens (Music), and produced by Johnny Bacolas. Natalis is the featured vocalists on "Dance with me."
During the pandemic of 2020, when live music was paused, the group released several quarantine videos. During this time, Bacolas and Stevens redesigned their show, growing it from 90 minutes to almost three hours in length, adding several new songs, as well as instrumentalists."We're really progressing with the show, revamping and adding a lot of new elements," says lead guitarist George Stevens. "This downtime that we've had really put everything in perspective as to what needed to be done and gave us the time to do that." Bassist and producer Johnny Bacolas adds, "That's been our attitude from the outset of this, to turn lemons into lemonade and to utilize this time, since everybody was going to be at home. George and I put the entire show under a microscope. We added songs, auditioned several additional musicians, brought in new percussionists and three new vocalists, and spent a lot of time training other instrumentalists. It was a really good time for us, since everybody has a home studio and we were able to collaborate electronically. It ended up being a really positive thing."

Gustav Otto Klemm (8 March 1884 in Leipzig – 5 January 1939 in Leipzig) was a German psychologist and philosopher, as well as the first chair as Professor of Applied Psychology at the University of Leipzig.
While his psychological work is largely irrelevant today, Klemm is one of the best-known representatives of the Leipzig School of Gestalt psychology. His studies on human motor, which were carried out under his guidance, had scientific validity, both in terms of their findings and the careful methodology. He is next to Nikolai Alexandrovich Bernstein among the first researchers who have studied the phenomenon of variability of partial movements in relation to the stability of destinations and Final parameters systematically and extensively.

International Automotive Design (IAD UK Ltd) was a British design company, based in West Sussex, England.
IAD UK Ltd was founded in 1976 by John and Yvonne Shute. Initially work came in the form of design services for Rail cars which then led to Automotive Body and Chassis Engineering but due to the increasing customers requirements it soon expanded to encompass everything from Design/ Styling and Engineering through to small-scale production.
IAD UK Ltd had at its peak a large R&D facility in Worthing, West Sussex, UK plus 5 overseas operations in the USA (California and Detroit), France (5 facilities), Spain and Germany (3 facilities) along with liaison offices in Korea, Japan and Russia. The US, German and Spanish offices having their own Styling studios.
It was the world's largest R&D consultancy not only working in Automotive, Commercial Vehicles and Aerospace. The British company was in competition with Italdesign, Pininfarina, Bertone. By the early 1990s the company employed over 1400 professionals. The majority of the projects completed by IAD was never made public keeping the high level of security that John Shute believed was the key to customers allowing IAD to be considered for future projects.
The company was awarded the Queen's Award for Export and Industry many times and ultimately John was appointed an OBE (Order of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth II for his endeavors on behalf of the British Motor industry.IAD Worthing Herald Article
IAD designed and developed many cutting edge and memorable concept cars developed as showcases demonstrating the company's creative and engineering expertise including the IAD Alien, IAD Hunter, IAD Interstate, IAD Arrival, IAD Royale, IAD Mini MPV, IAD Venus and finally the IAD Magia. IAD amassed a talented group of designers, engineers and prototype builders who have subsequently gone on to senior positions within the automotive industry.
They specialized in car prototyping and engineering design. Mayflower Corp. purchased IAD after it went into receivership in the early 1990s with the Engineering, Design groups and facilities were sold to Daewoo Motors 1993.
The Mazda MX5 (Miata) was one of the many projects IAD was involved in, developing not only Exterior and Interior style for the vehicle in the UK/ US (California) but also building prototypes locally prior to volume production in 1989. Mazda came to IAD to replicate the "true" British sports car invoking the MG's success of handling, and even directed the Chassis team to copy the exhaust note of early MGBs.
Personnel
The founder John Shute was a great entrepreneur who was a tough but shrewd businessman. He saw possibilities for
expansion in the Automotive R&D consultancy business and grabbed it.
He had a knack along with his sales team of getting projects out of a manufacturer which would often led to bigger projects later on. Overall John, who died from cancer in the 1990s was an enigmatic character who suffered fools badly but rewarded people who tried.

"Chequered Love" is the second single by British singer Kim Wilde. The song was released in the spring of 1981 to follow Wilde's successful debut "Kids in America". As with that single, writing credits were given to Wilde's father and brother Marty and Ricky Wilde, with the latter also being given production credits. The 12" version is no longer in length than the 7"; however, better sound quality is achieved by the grooves not being as compressed - a common practice for "marketing" during the 1980s. The song later appeared on Wilde's self-titled debut album.
"Chequered Love" became another hit for Wilde, reaching the number four on the UK Singles Chart, number one in South Africa (succeeding "Kids in America"), and peaking inside the top 10 all around the world except North America. It was certified gold in the UK, and has sold over a million copies worldwide.

Raymond Chikapa Enock Phiri (23 March 1947 – 12 July 2017) was a South African jazz, fusion and mbaqanga musician born in Mpumalanga to Thabethe Phiri, a Malawian immigrant worker, and South African guitarist nicknamed "Just Now" Phiri. He was a founding member of the Cannibals in the 1970s. When the Cannibals disbanded Ray founded Stimela, with whom he conceived gold and platinum-selling albums like Fire, Passion and (1984), Look, Listen and Decide (1986). He collaborated with Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambazo on Simon's Graceland (album) project in 1985.
Career
Ray Phiri was born near Nelspruit in the then Eastern Transvaal, now Mpumalanga Province, in South Africa. In 1985, Paul Simon asked Ray along with Ladysmith Black Mambazo and other South African musicians to join his Graceland project, which was successful and also helped the South African musicians to make names for themselves abroad.
Phiri was to collaborate with Simon again on Simon's Rhythm of the Saints album, which saw him perform in over 30 nations during 1990 and 1991, including Paul Simon's Concert in the Park (August 1991, Central Park) and New York's Madison Square Garden, as well as appearing on Saturday Night Live and other top television shows in the United States. The tour concluded in early 1992 with concerts staged in South Africa at venues in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban. In 2012 Simon organised a European Graceland 25th Anniversary Tour in which Phiri also contributed his voice, guitar and leadership.
In a 2011 interview with The Sunday Times Phiri said that there was "bad blood" between him and Simon. Phiri maintained that Simon never gave him credit for the songs he had written for Graceland, and that Ladysmith Black Mambazo "hardly got any royalties". But he added: "maybe I wouldn't have been able to handle all that wealth. I sleep at night, I have my sanity and I enjoy living. The big rock 'n' roll machine did not munch me."
Personal life and death
Phiri was involved in a series of car accidents which affected his personal life and musical career. Phiri was badly injured in 1987 in a crash that claimed the lives of his band manager and six others. In 2003, his wife was killed in a car accident, but Ray escaped serious injury. Phiri was diagnosed with lung cancer and died at the age of 70 on 12 July 2017 at a Nelspruit hospital. A memorial service for Phiri was held at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit on 20 July, and the funeral service took place at the same venue on 22 July.
Achievements
Phiri has received many awards in recognition for his contribution in the music industry, one of these is the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver awarded to him by the South African president. This was to honor his sterling contribution to the South African music industry and the successful use of arts as an instrument of social transformation.

Batra was born in New York City where her father Roger W. Tubby was a journalist and secretary to President Truman, later serving in the United Nations as US Ambassador during the Kennedy period. At a young age, she was exposed to outdoor life, natural history, fishing and hunting especially after the family moved to the Adirondacks. She graduated from Saranac Lake (New York) High School in 1956 and received a Bachelor of Arts in zoology from Swarthmore College in 1960. She married her botany professor Lekh R. Batra (1929–1999) and continued her studies in the University of Kansas under Charles D. Michener. She received a PhD in 1964 for studies on sociobiology of sweat bees. She studied solitary bees in the family Colletidae, including on the chemistry of their waterproof nest-cell linings made of polyesters.
Batra had a daughter (1964) and a son (1967). She joined the US Department of Agriculture in Maryland in 1967, retiring in 1999. She continues to study bees at the Smithsonian Institution.

Uprising for Change is an Afghan civil disobedience movement that started with tent sit-ins in central Kabul in June 2017 in response to the 31 May 2017 Kabul bombing, the killing of protestors by Afghan security forces on 2 June, the 3 June suicide bombings at a funeral of one of the 2 June victims, and subsequent police violence. On 11 June 2017, the commander of the Kabul Garrison, Ahmadzai, and Kabul police chief Hassan Shah Frogh were suspended from duty following the protests. In March 2018, Uprising for Change called for the Afghan government to be replaced by a six-month interim government.
Background
Nonviolent resistance in Afghanistan dates back to at least Khudai Khidmatgar, which held long-term campaigns of nonviolent resistance to the British colonial government in the 1930s. In the 2010s, the Tabassum movement in November 2015 and the Enlightenment Movement, which was especially active during 2016–2017, were two new grassroots movements in which massive, multiethnic protests, with women playing significant roles, took place in Kabul and across Afghanistan in favour of Hazaras' rights, calling for improved security and criticising both the Afghan government and the Taliban.
Creation
On 31 May 2017, a car bomb exploded in central Kabul near embassies and the presidential palace, killing 100 people. An anti-violence vigil started the following day, on 1 June, with the participation of 25 civil society organisations. A protest march took place on 2 June, during which six of the protestors were killed by Afghan security forces. In the evening, tents were set up in protest against the new killings.
On 3 June, some of the protestors proposed the name Uprising for Change () as a broad name for the protests.
Leadership and membership
In the early phases of the June protests, numerous groups and individuals coordinated without a centralised leadership. Two of the main groups involved included Khorasanian, a cultural association of young Tajiks aiming to remove words of Arabic and Pashto origin from Dari, and Jombesh-e Guzar (), a group involved in party politics and related to Jamiat-e Islami. Members of the Enlightenment Movement came to the tents and publicly declared opposition to the police attacks, but "avoided" public signs of participation during the days that followed. On 21 June 2017, one of the Uprising for Change leaders, Barna Salehi, stated the Uprising for Change had a 45-member central committee and several sub-committees. The groups and individuals were mostly Tajiks, while describing their aims as "all ethnicities against the government".
Independence
In June 2017, activists in Uprising for Change insisted that they were happy for Jamiat-e Islami to support them, but were independent from the party. Jamiat-e Islami also claimed that the protestors were independent "civil society groups and ordinary civilians alike". Tabish Forugh argued that Uprising for Change was not sufficiently well organised and was "vulnerable and exposed" to cooptation and manipulation by established political parties and opportunist politicians. On 3 July 2017, Asar Hakimi of Uprising for Change stated that the group is "not related to any political group or political movement".
Actions
Protests
On 3 June, the day that the name Uprising for Change started circulating, three suicide bombings killed 20 of the participants at a funeral of one of the victims shot by security forces in 2 June protest, the son of a Senator. In anger at the new killings, more protestors joined and set up more protest tents, reaching a total of seven tents on 6 June, each typically occupied by "a few dozen people". Similar tents were set up in towns in Baghlan Province and Takhar Province.
Around 13 June, the Kabul protestors removed six of their tents. On the night of 19–20 June, security forces removed the remaining tent, using live fire against the protestors, killing a 23-year old protestor. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission criticised the "continuation of violence" by the authorities. On 22 June, the Ministry of the Interior defined that police carried firearms while removing the last tent.
On 3 July 2017, Uprising for Change held a driving rally protest around Kabul, flying flags and honking horns for two hours, calling for prosecution of those responsible for ordering the use of live fire by security forces in June. The protestors also called for the head of the National Directorate of Security and the Minister of Interior Affairs to be dismissed.
Proposals
In March 2018, Uprising for Change proposed to replace the government of Afghanistan by a six-month interim administration. A member of Afghan Lawyers Union, Wahidullah Farzaye, argued that the government had been formed in violation of the constitution, so the interim government proposal appeared legitimate and possibly effective.
Effects
The tent sit-ins and government roadblocks set up in response created considerable traffic blockage. Uprising for Change mitigated public frustration and took into account mediation efforts by reducing the number of tents from seven to one.
Uprising for Change demanded that officials suspected of responsibility for the killing be suspended. President Ashraf Ghani responded by organising public meetings with representatives of civil society, summarising highlights of the meetings that criticised the tent sit-ins, and refusing to suspend suspected perpetrators. A parliamentary commission was prepared, calling for investigations and prosecutions. On 11 June, before the commission was formalised, the commander of the Kabul Garrison, Ahmadzai, and Kabul police chief Hassan Shah Frogh were suspended from duty.

Harvey Johnson Jr. (born December 21, 1946), is an American politician from Mississippi. He was elected in 1997 as the first African American Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, serving two terms. He was known for his achievements in gaining reinvestment in the city to revitalize downtown.
He ran again in 2009 and was elected. When he ran for what would have been his fourth term, he was defeated in the Democratic primary in July 2013 by challengers Chokwe Lumumba, who was elected as mayor, and Jonathan Lee.
Biography
Harvey Johnson Jr. was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and attended the Vicksburg public schools, graduating from Rosa A. Temple High School. He received a bachelor's degree in political science from Tennessee State University and a master's degree in political science from the University of Cincinnati.
His professional career includes the founding of the Mississippi Institute of Small Towns, a non-profit agency developed to assist small economically depressed towns with minority leadership with housing, community development and infrastructure needs. In 1990 Governor Ray Mabus appointed the subject to a six-year term on the state tax commission, which included the oversight of the newly established gaming industry.
In 1993, Johnson ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Jackson, placing third in the Democratic primary behind two white candidates, incumbent mayor J. Kane Ditto and former mayor Dale Danks. But in 1997, Johnson defeated Ditto in the Democratic primary, and later defeated Republican opponent Charlotte Reeves in the general election, becoming Jackson's first African-American mayor.
Supporters credited Johnson with overseeing a dramatic renaissance in the city, leading the charge for several projects to help revive a decaying downtown area, including the revitalization of the Farish Street Neighborhood Historic District and passage of a controversial bond issue to build a convention center. Critics charged that he was an unresponsive leader who was not appropriately concerned with the city's large crime problem, neglected the maintenance of streets, and did little to curb the exodus of Jackson's upper- and middle-class residents to places outside the city limits.
During his reelection bid in 2001, Johnson faced off against Republican challenger, C. Daryl Neely, a city councilman. It was the first time in the city's history that two African-American mayoral candidates faced each other in the general election. Johnson soundly defeated Neely with 61% of the vote.
In 2005, Johnson was challenged in the Democratic primary by Frank Melton, a controversial TV station manager; the challenger promised to solve the city's crime problem in 90 days while giving few specific crime plans, making crime the central focus of the election. Critics charged that Johnson said crime was only a "perception." But he had complained about the "perception of hopelessness" which he said the media's focus on crime engendered. The phrase "perception of crime," while inaccurate, was used widely by opponents and critics of the incumbent mayor. Melton defeated the incumbent by 63 percent of the vote in the Democratic Primary. Melton easily defeated Republican challenger Rick Whitlow in the general election and succeeded Johnson as mayor of Jackson.
Johnson is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is an alum of National Urban Fellows, class of 1976. Johnson is also a deacon at the Hope Springs Missionary Baptist Church of Jackson, Mississippi.
In early 2009, Johnson again ran for Mayor of Jackson. On Tuesday, May 5, 2009, he led a crowded field of ten candidates in the Democratic primary. Gaining 28% of the vote, Johnson was forced into a runoff with City Councilman Marshand Crisler, who had finished a close second with 27% of the vote. In the runoff two weeks later, Johnson defeated Crisler, winning in five of the seven wards, despite being outspent four to one. In a majority-black city that votes heavily Democratic, Johnson handily defeated Republican challenger George Lambus and four independent candidates in the June 2nd general election. Johnson's election has made him become the city's first three-term mayor since Dale Danks.
Running for re-election in the Democratic primary on May 7, 2013, the veteran mayor was defeated by Chokwe Lumumba, Ward Two Councilman, and Jonathan Lee, former Chamber of Commerce president, in every city ward. Lumumba was elected but died in office in 2014.

The Rathcoole ambush () was an ambush carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) near the village of Rathcoole in County Cork on 16 June 1921 during the Irish War of Independence. Under the command of Paddy O'Brien, the IRA's 2nd Cork Brigade attacked an armed convoy of the Auxiliary Division returning to their barracks in Millstreet after collecting supplies. After 50 minutes of intense fighting, the IRA managed to inflict heavy casualties on the Auxiliaries before a shortage of ammunition forced them to withdraw.
Background
After the railway line leading to Millstreet had been cut by the IRA in several different places, the Auxiliary Division's L Company stationed in Mount Leader House were forced to travel in convoys to the railway station in Banteer to collect their supplies. Each convoy was escorted by armoured cars with the Crossley tenders each carrying a Lewis gun to provide further protection. As many roads and bridges in the area had been sabotaged by the IRA, the only route the Auxiliaries could take was the Millstreet–Banteer road. In May, following a meeting by the leaders of the 2nd Cork Brigade's Millstreet battalion, the republicans decided to ambush the convoy.
After monitoring the route for 12 days and recording the Auxiliaries movements, the IRA noticed that the size and strength of the convoy could vary each trip, with the smallest composed of 2 Crossley tenders carrying 20 personnel and the largest consisting of 6 vehicles and 40 men. Due to the presence of armoured cars and the possibility of facing a British convoy at full strength, the IRA decided to use mines for the operation. As armoured cars were beginning to see more extensive use by Crown forces, the column had been training their men throughout the Spring in the manufacturing and deployment of mines as a means of countering them. 16 June was chosen as the day for the attack as the republicans believed the British would make two trips that day. It was also decided that they would only attack the second convoy returning in the evening, as the setting sun would allow the column to successfully withdraw.
The IRA chose a site along the Millstreet−Banteer road about a mile from the village of Rathcoole. The site gave the IRA an advantageous position; to the south of the road was an elevated position, which could provide the volunteers with natural cover, and a pine wood that would allow them to observe the Auxiliaries without being spotted.
On 14 June, the IRA commanders sent messages to the brigade's other battalions in Newmarket, Kanturk, Mallow and Charleville requesting that they send all available men to the Rathcoole area. After the battalions had assembled the following day, the IRA force commanded by Paddy O'Brien numbered 140 men armed with rifles, shotguns and a Hotchkiss machine gun. Parts of the column also worked on creating barricades which were to used as road blocks once the engagement commenced.
Ambush
On the morning of 16 June, the IRA laid 6 5–7 pound mines along the road, spacing each one about 150 yards apart. At around 10:30 a.m., the first of the 2 convoy was sighted, but was allowed to pass without incident. The British again drove through the ambush site at about 4:30 p.m.; the convoy consisted of 3 Crossley tenders with an armoured Lancia leading at the front and carried 25 personnel. At 5 p.m., the volunteers moved to their positions in preparation for the convoy's return. O'Brien divided the column into 10 sections: 8 of the sections were situated in the hill and woods overlooking the road, with the remaining 2 assigned to the north to prevent the British from taking cover behind the stonewalls. 6 of the southern sections and 1 from the north covered each mine along the road with the remaining sections assigned to protect the flanks. The IRA planned to have each section to target a certain vehicle, this way they could pin down each of the lorries and prevent the Auxiliaries from consolidating and fighting as a whole unit.
When the Auxiliaries arrived back at the area on their return trip, the volunteers held off from attacking the first 3 lorries in the convoy and waited until the fourth vehicle had reached the sixth mine. Once the Crossley tender was in position, the mine was detonated; however, due to the ground being too soft, the blast was absorbed and only disabled the vehicle. The volunteers immediately opened fire on the stricken lorry, pinning down the Auxiliaries and preventing them from leaving their vehicle. The IRA also opened fire with their Hotchkiss machine gun, though they were later forced to disuse it due to jamming. At the same time, the Lancia, which was travelling at the front of the convoy, turned around to provide assistance, but was also disabled after it drove over another mine. The volunteers then attempted to assault the fourth lorry, but were forced back by machine gunfire from the third lorry.
Despite being taken completely by surprise, the Auxiliaries managed to form defensive positions by taking cover in and around their vehicles. They immediately began firing towards the IRA's positions with their Lewis gums, but due the terrain providing the volunteers with natural protection they failed to inflict any casualties. However, due to the intensity of the machine gun fire, the IRA were not able to advance beyond their positions. Attempting to outflank the republican positions, a group of 5 Auxiliaries from the third lorry left their vehicle and began making their way up the road. Upon seeing this, the volunteers set off another of their mines as the Auxiliaries were passing over it, incapacitating 3 of them. The remaining 2 men who weren't affected by the blast began firing towards IRA before both of them were eventually shot.
After recognising the precarious situation he was faced with, the commander of the convoy William Edward Crossey ordered one of his men, Francis Scott, to run back to their barracks in Millstreet and alert the rest of their company. Despite coming under heavy gunfire during the initial part of his journey, Scott managed to reach Mount Leader House and reinforcements were immediately sent to relieve the convoy. However, whilst driving to the ambush site, the relief force found that the road was blocked by 3 cut down trees. Subsequently, some of the men then began making their way on foot but would arrive after the ambush had ended.
At around this time, the IRA's supply of ammunition was becoming exhausted as each man only carried 40 rounds with them. After around 50 minutes of fighting, the republicans disengaged and began making their way along pre-planned lines of retreat. British reports at the time attributed the IRA's withdrawal to an aircraft which was flying nearby; however, most republican sources do make any mention of a plane. Out of the 25 men that were in the convoy, the Auxiliaries suffered 16 casualties, of which 2 were killed and 14 wounded. The IRA on the other hand did not suffer a single casualty. For their actions during the ambush, constables Crossey and Scott as well as William Kay and Henry W. T. George were awarded the Constabulary Medal.
Aftermath
The IRA considered the ambush to be a success. In an article for An Cosantóir, Paddy O'Brien wrote of the ambush that:
The following day, an IRA detachment sent to the ambush site to retrieve the undetonated mines managed to recover 1,350 rounds of ammunition which had been abandoned by the Auxiliaries whilst they were clearing up the area. This was beneficial has they were able to replenish their ammunition stocks which they had depleted during the ambush.
Despite suffering heavy casualties, Crossey was pleased with how his men performed during in the ambush. In his after action report, Crossey stated:
On 24 June, about a 1,000 British troops from the towns of Macroom, Kanturk, Tralee, Ballincollig, Ballyvonaire, Buttevant and Killarney carried out large scale searches around the Rathcoole area. On the same day, the Auxiliaries arrested and killed IRA volunteer Michael Dineen. According to IRA accounts, Dineen was reportedly tortured by the Auxiliaries before having some his bones broken and being repeatedly shot. On 1 July, Auxiliaries shot dead Bernard Moynihan, another volunteer, and burned down Rathcoole wood. The IRA then began making plans for an attack on Mount Leader House, but these were postponed due the announcement of the truce on 11 July.

The Tristan hotspot is a volcanic hotspot which is responsible for the volcanic activity which forms the volcanoes in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It is thought to have formed the island of Tristan da Cunha and the Walvis Ridge on the African Plate.
Geology
It is also believed to be closely connected with the Paraná and Etendeka flood basalt provinces, which formed over the hotspot during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.
The Tristan and Gough hotspots are widely spaced end-members of the volcanic system that generated the Walvis Ridge on the African plate and the Rio Grande Rise on the South American plate beginning at when the Paraná and Etendeka traps formed. Whether or not Tristan and Gough represent two distinct volcanic centers is still debated.
argued that the Walvis Ridge is not the product of a deep mantle plume or the Tristan hotspot, but that changes in the internal stress in the spreading African and South American plates trigger changes in the magmatic processes in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Walvis Ridge should then have developed as a result of these periodic stress releases along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
found that the hotspot trails in the eastern South Atlantic (Tristan, Gough, Discovery, Shona, and possibly Bouvet) started forming synchronously . Older seamounts east of these hotspot trails formed at the edge of the African swell where the oceanic crust was spreading apart and are not the product of hotspot volcanism. The Tristan-Gough trail switched from forming a series of aseismic ridges to a broader line of guyots and smaller volcanic ridges at about the same time.
The hotspots of the eastern South Atlantic formed along the plume generation zones (PGZs) of the African large low seismic velocity province (LLSVP). LLSVPs are dense and stable structures, and most of the plumes, kimberlites, and large igneous provinces (LIPs) on Earth can be rotated back to the PGZs. All major African LIPs (Karoo, Paraná-Etendeka, and Agulhas) formed at the PGZs of the African LLSVP but the Tristan-Gough hotspot was the only hotspot located at a spreading boundary and therefore the only African hotspot that started to form a volcanic trail.
Palaeoclimatic and evolutionary role
Based on molecular estimates, found that the Homo-Pan divergence occurred (in contrast to earlier estimates that suggested around 5 Ma). Arnason et al. also estimated the Platyrrhini-Catarrhini divergence to have occurred around and found that the latter evolved in South America before their dispersal into Africa. Arnason et al. hypothesised that the Rio Grande-Walvis Ridge system was exposed above sea level and formed a chain of islands across the South Atlantic during the Maastrichtian and Palaeocene allowing the primates to disperse across the ocean. Other researchers dismiss the hypothesis of Arnason et al. instead favouring a less spectacular rafting event.
Other hints of transoceanic island hopping in the fossil record is Lavocatavis, a flightless terror bird found in Eocene layers in Algeria, the only one found outside South America.

Apep, also spelled Apepi or Aapep, (Ancient Egyptian: ; Coptic: ) or Apophis (; Ancient Greek: ) was the ancient Egyptian deity who embodied chaos (ı͗zft in Egyptian) and was thus the opponent of light and Ma'at (order/truth). He appears in art as a giant serpent. Apep was first mentioned in the Eighth Dynasty, and he was honored in the names of the Fourteenth Dynasty king 'Apepi and of the Greater Hyksos king Apophis.
Etymology
Development
Ra was the solar deity, bringer of light, and thus the upholder of Ma'at. Apep was viewed as the greatest enemy of Ra, and thus was given the title Enemy of Ra, and also "the Lord of Chaos".
Apep was seen as a giant snake or serpent leading to such titles as Serpent from the Nile and Evil Dragon. Some elaborations said that he stretched 16 yards in length and had a head made of flint. Already on a Naqada I (c. 4000 BCE) C-ware bowl (now in Cairo) a snake was painted on the inside rim combined with other desert and aquatic animals as a possible enemy of a deity, possibly a solar deity, who is invisibly hunting in a big rowing vessel.
While in most texts Apep is described as a giant snake, he is sometimes depicted as a crocodile.
The few descriptions of Apep's origin in myth usually demonstrate that it was born after Ra, usually from his umbilical cord. Combined with its absence from Egyptian creation myths, this has been interpreted as suggesting that Apep was not a primordial force in Egyptian theology, but a consequence of Ra's birth. This suggests that evil in Egyptian theology is the consequence of an individual's own struggles against non-existence.
Battles with Ra
Tales of Apep's battles against Ra were elaborated during the New Kingdom. Storytellers said that every day Apep must lie below the horizon and not persist in the mortal kingdom. This appropriately made him a part of the underworld. In some stories, Apep waited for Ra in a western mountain called Bakhu, where the sun set, and in others, Apep lurked just before dawn, in the Tenth region of the Night. The wide range of Apep's possible locations gained him the title World-Encircler. It was thought that his terrifying roar would cause the underworld to rumble. Myths sometimes say that Apep was trapped there, because he had been the previous chief god overthrown by Ra, or because he was evil and had been imprisoned.
The Coffin Texts imply that Apep used a magical gaze to overwhelm Ra and his entourage. Ra was assisted by a number of defenders who travelled with him, including Set and possibly the Eye of Ra. Apep's movements were thought to cause earthquakes, and his battles with Set may have been meant to explain the origin of thunderstorms. In one account, Ra himself defeats Apep in the form of a cat.
What few accounts there are of Apep's origin usually describe it as being born from Ra's umbilical cord.
Worship
Ra's victory each night was thought to be ensured by the prayers of the Egyptian priests and worshippers at temples. The Egyptians practiced a number of rituals and superstitions that were thought to ward off Apep, and aid Ra in continuing his journey across the sky.
In an annual rite called the Banishing of Chaos, priests would build an effigy of Apep that was thought to contain all of the evil and darkness in Egypt, and burn it to protect everyone from Apep's evil for another year.
The Egyptian priests had a detailed guide to fighting Apep, referred to as The Books of Overthrowing Apep (or the Book of Apophis, in Greek). The chapters described a gradual process of dismemberment and disposal, and include:
Spitting Upon Apep
Defiling Apep with the Left Foot
Taking a Lance to Smite Apep
Fettering Apep
Taking a Knife to Smite Apep
Putting Fire Upon Apep
In addition to stories about Ra's victories, this guide had instructions for making wax models, or small drawings, of the serpent, which would be spat on, mutilated and burnt, whilst reciting spells that would kill Apep. Fearing that even the image of Apep could give power to the demon, any rendering would always include another deity to subdue the monster.
As Apep was thought to live in the underworld, he was sometimes thought of as an Eater of Souls. Thus the dead also needed protection, so they were sometimes buried with spells that could destroy Apep. The Book of the Dead does not frequently describe occasions when Ra defeated the chaos snake explicitly called Apep. Only Book of the Dead Spells 7 and 39 can be explained as such.

The School District of Greenfield is a school district located in southwestern Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which serves the City of Greenfield.
In 2012, the district selected former district educator and administrator, Lisa Elliott, to become superintendent of the school district.
History
Before Greenfield incorporated as a city in 1957, there were a number of school districts throughout the town for neighborhood elementary schools. Parents could pick which high school in Milwaukee County they wanted to send their children. But in the late 1950s, changes in state law and overfilled high schools meant that Greenfield needed to build a high school of its own. This task was made difficult as the surrounding municipalities of Milwaukee, West Allis, West Milwaukee, Hales Corners, and Greendale continued to carve out pieces of the Town of Greenfield. Every annexation required the school districts affected to pay money to the annexing municipality, draining coffers. In the late 1950s, Greenfield incorporated as a city and the several small school districts consolidated into two: Whitnall School District and Greenfield School District.
Passage of two referendums allowed for major additions and improvements to Greenfield High School that included a new performing arts center, fitness center, academic wing, and swimming pool. After the 2010 construction was completed, district offices were combined with the high school complex.

Nusinersen, marketed as Spinraza, is a medication used in treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare neuromuscular disorder. In December 2016, it became the first approved drug used in treating this disorder.
Since the condition it treats is so rare, Nusinersen has so-called "orphan drug" designation in the United States and the European Union.
Medical uses
The drug is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy associated with a mutation in the SMN1 gene. It is administered directly to the central nervous system (CNS) using intrathecal injection.
In clinical trials, the drug halted the disease progression. In around 60% of infants affected by type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, it improves motor function.
Side effects
People treated with nusinersen had an increased risk of upper and lower respiratory infections and congestion, ear infections, constipation, pulmonary aspiration, teething, and scoliosis. There is a risk that growth of infants and children might be stunted. In older clinical trial subjects, the most common adverse events were headache, back pain, and other adverse effects from the spinal injection, such as post-dural-puncture headache.
Although not observed in the trial patients, a reduction in platelets as well as a risk of kidney damage are theoretical risks for antisense drugs and therefore platelets and kidney function should be monitored during treatment.
In 2018, several cases of communicating hydrocephalus in children and adults treated with nusinersen emerged; it remains unclear whether this was drug related.
Pharmacology
Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SMN1 gene which codes for survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. People survive owing to low amounts of the SMN protein produced from the SMN2 gene. Nusinersen modulates alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, functionally converting it into SMN1 gene, thus increasing the level of SMN protein in the CNS.
The drug distributes to CNS and peripheral tissues.
The half-life is estimated to be 135 to 177 days in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 63 to 87 days in blood plasma. The drug is metabolized via exonuclease (3′- and 5′)-mediated hydrolysis and does not interact with CYP450 enzymes. The primary route of elimination is likely by urinary excretion for nusinersen and its metabolites.
Chemistry
Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide in which the 2'-hydroxy groups of the ribofuranosyl rings are replaced with 2'-O-2-methoxyethyl groups and the phosphate linkages are replaced with phosphorothioate linkages.
History
Nusinersen was developed in a collaboration between Adrian Krainer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (formerly called Isis Pharmaceuticals). Initial work of target discovery of nusinersen was done by Dr. Ravindra Singh and co-workers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School funded by Cure SMA.
Starting in 2012, Ionis partnered with Biogen on development and, in 2015, Biogen acquired an exclusive license to the drug for a license fee, milestone payments up to , and tiered royalties thereafter; Biogen also paid the costs of development subsequent to taking the license. The license to Biogen included licenses to intellectual property that Ionis had acquired from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and University of Massachusetts.
In November 2016, the new drug application was accepted under the FDA's priority review process on the strength of the Phase III trial and the unmet need, and was also accepted for review at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at that time. It was approved by the FDA in December 2016 and by EMA in May 2017 as the first drug to treat SMA. Subsequently, nusinersen was approved to treat SMA in Canada (July 2017), Japan (July 2017), Brasil (August 2017), Switzerland (September 2017), and China (February 2019).
Society and culture
Economics
Nusinersen list price in the USA is per injection which puts the treatment cost at in the first year and annually after that. According to The New York Times, this places nusinersen "among the most expensive drugs in the world".
In October 2017, the authorities in Denmark recommended nusinersen for use only in a small subset of people with SMA type 1 (young babies) and refused to offer it as a standard treatment for all other people with SMA quoting an "unreasonably high price" compared to the benefit.
Norwegian authorities rejected the funding in October 2017 because the price of the medicine was "unethically high". In February 2018, the funding was approved for people under 18 years old.
In August 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which weighs the cost-effectiveness of therapies for the NHS in England and Wales, recommended against offering nusinersen to people with SMA. Children with SMA type 1 were treated in the UK under a Biogen-funded expanded access programme; after enrolling 80 children, the scheme closed to new people in November 2018. In May 2019, however, NICE reversed its stance and announced its decision to recommend nusinersen for use across a wide spectrum of SMA for a 5-year period.
The Irish Health Service Executive decided in February 2019 that nusinersen was too expensive to fund, saying the cost would be about €600,000 per patient in the first year and around €380,000 a year thereafter "with an estimated budget impact in excess of €20 million over a five-year period" for the 25 children with SMA living in Ireland. Both the manufacturer and patient groups disputed the numbers and pointed out that actual pricing arrangements for Ireland are in line with the negotiated price for the BeneluxA initiative which Ireland has been a member of since June 2018.
As of May 2019, nusinersen was available in public healthcare in more than 40 countries.
In December 2021, nusinersen was included in the extended insurance coverage of China, and the price was reduced from ¥697,000 per vial to around ¥33,000 (~US$5,100) per vial.

The Federal Court of Malaysia () is the highest court and the final appellate court in Malaysia. It is housed in the Palace of Justice in Putrajaya. The court was established during Malaya's independence in 1957 and received its current name in 1994.
History
The earliest predecessor of the Federal Court was the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island (now Penang), Singapore and Malacca, which was established by the Second Charter of Justice, issued by the Crown as letters patent dated 27 November 1826. The Court was presided over by the Governor of the Straits Settlements and Resident Councillor of the settlement where the court was to be held, and another judge called the Recorder. The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 reorganised the Court, providing the Straits Settlements with two Recorders, one for Prince of Wales' Island and the other for Singapore and Malacca.
Following the reconstitution of the Straits Settlements as a Crown colony with effect from 1 April 1867, the Court of Judicature was replaced by the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements. The Governor and Resident Councillors ceased to be judges of the Court.
Further changes to the Court's constitution were made in 1873. It now consisted of two divisions – the Chief Justice and the Senior Puisne Judge formed the Singapore and Malacca division of the Court, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior Puisne Judge formed the Penang division. The Supreme Court also received jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal in civil matters. In 1878 the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay first to the Court of Appeal and then to the Queen-in-Council, the latter appeals being heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
As a result of legislation passed in 1885, the Supreme Court consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges. The Court was significantly altered in 1907. It now had two divisions, one exercising original civil and criminal jurisdiction and the other appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction.
During the Japanese occupation of Singapore (1942–1945), all the courts that had operated under the British were replaced by new courts established by the Japanese Military Administration. The Syonan Koto-Hoin (Supreme Court) was formed on 29 May 1942; there was also a Court of Appeal, but it was never convened.
Following the end of World War II, the courts that had existed before the war were restored. There was no change in the judicial system when the Straits Settlements were dissolved in 1946 and Singapore became a crown colony in its own right, except that the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements became known as the Supreme Court of Singapore.
The courts of Penang and Malacca merged with the rest of Malaya to form the Supreme Court of the Federation of Malaya. This continued upon independence in 1957 until 1963. When Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, and Singapore formed Malaysia in 1963, the court was renamed the Federal Court of Malaysia.
The judicial power of Malaysia was vested in a Federal Court, a High Court in Malaya, a High Court in Borneo (now the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak), and a High Court in Singapore (which replaced the Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore). Appeals lay from the High Court in Singapore to the Federal Court in Kuala Lumpur, and then to the Privy Council.
The merger did not last: in 1965 Singapore was expelled from the Federation of Malaysia and became an independent republic. However, the High Court of Singapore remained part of the Malaysian Federal Court structure until 1969, when Singapore enacted the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to regularise the judicial system.
Before 1985, the Federal Court remained the second highest court in the land, being subordinate to the Privy Council in England. On 1 January 1978, appeals to the Privy Council in criminal and constitutional matters were abolished, while appeals in civil matters were abolished on 1 January 1985. When appeals to the Privy Council were abolished, the court was renamed Supreme Court of Malaysia. Finally, on 24 June 1994, as part of reforms, the court was once again renamed the Federal Court of Malaysia.
Current judges
The court is composed of the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal, the Chief Judges of the High Court in Malaya and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak and 11 other Federal Court judges. The Chief Justice is also the head of the judiciary in Malaysia. All judges are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister of Malaysia. All judges mandatorily retire at the age of 66 and 6 months. In order of seniority, they are as follows:

The Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad is a short-line railroad operating in North Carolina. At one time the AR was a Class 2 railroad. The railroad has of track that runs from Aberdeen to Fayetteville, North Carolina.
History
The AR was incorporated in 1892 by businessman John Blue. He built the railroad to get his timber and turpentine products to market. On June 30, 1895, the first stretch of road was opened from Aberdeen to Endon. In 1898 the company added a line from Ashley Heights to Raeford which soon became the main line with the Endon line as a branch. Shortly thereafter, the Endon branch was extended to Juniper. The main line was extended to Dundarrach in 1900, Rockfish in 1902, Fenix in 1904 and a branch from Rockfish to Hope Mills was added in 1905. For a while, Aberdeen–Hope Mills became the main line, with branches to Juniper and Fenix.
On November 14, 1909, another branch from Raeford to Wagram was opened. In 1912, the company abandoned the Endon branch and used the rails to construct an extension from Fenix to Fayetteville which opened on December 23 that year. At the same time the line to Hope Mills was abandoned, as it became unnecessary with the new link to the main line of the Atlantic coastline Railroad in Fayetteville. Over the years the railroad's traffic has shifted from lumber to agriculture products. The AR is still owned by the Blue family and operates freight trains from Aberdeen to Fayetteville. The Wagram branch was sold to the Laurinburg and Southern Railroad in 1921. Passenger service ended in 1949.

Sonar Records is an English, Coventry-based record label. It is a family business that is not associated with any major record label. it continues to release new music as well as back catalogues of Coventry artists.
Creation
The Sonar Records Group includes four labels: Sonar Records, Frantic, Dodgy Ticket, and Psalm Reader Records. Owners John and Cary Lord also owned Cabin Studio in Coventry and used the studio to record their label artists. The Sonar Record label was established in 1983 with the first 45" vinyl single from Coventry guitarist/singer/songwriter, Dave Pepper under the guise of the new romanticism of ‘Courtiers of fashion'. This is a very rare recording and the first record on the Sonar record label catalogue number SON1 and would have been recorded on 8 track analogue at Cabin Studio. Paul Sampson produced and engineered the single.
Coventry – Spring 1983. The Furious Apples vocalist Greg Crabb recruited Robin Hill (Pink Umbrellas) on drums, John Westacott (ex-Urge) on bass and Raphael Moore on guitar, along with Mike Crabb, and Abbe Collins on keyboards to record a 7″ vinyl single – "Engineering" b/w "Belladonna", was released in October 1983 recorded at 8 track Cabin Studios in Coventry. This was the second release on the Sonar record label and Paul Sampson engineered and produced both songs.
Coventry artists The Crokodile Tears have been releasing product on dodgy Ticket records since the beginning. The Croks are still active on the coventry music scene.
25th Anniversary
In 2009, Sonar Records released a compilation album to celebrate their 25th anniversary and arranaged an accompanying gig at the spencer sports club in Coventry. It was well attended. The artists and details are listed online.

"The Well" is the eighth episode of the first season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they search for an Asgardian weapon while fighting a paganist hate group. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Monica Owusu-Breen, and directed by Jonathan Frakes.
Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode serves as a direct tie-in to the film Thor: The Dark World, depicting the immediate aftermath of the film, but has its own stand alone storyline revolving around a separate Asgardian character (portrayed by guest star Peter MacNicol). The storyline also begins to reveal the backstories of several main characters, especially Dalton's Grant Ward, whose memories of the titular well are revealed as flashbacks throughout the episode.
"The Well" originally aired on ABC on November 19, 2013, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 6.89 million viewers.
Plot
In Norway, the leaders of a pagan hate group obsessed with Norse mythology find part of a staff, hidden within an ancient tree, that grants them superhuman strength. Agent Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, having recently assisted with the cleanup of London following the Convergence, investigate the tree and deduce that it contained an Asgardian staff. Consulting with Elliot Randolph, a professor of Norse mythology, they learn of the Berserker, an Asgardian warrior who remained on Earth after a long ago war, and broke his war staff into three pieces. The professor reveals three poems, each pointing to the location of a piece; one matched the tree in Norway. Randolph sends the team to Baffin Island, but they soon realize that this was misdirection. They follow one of the poems to underground catacombs in Spain, where Randolph forces agent Grant Ward to touch a second piece of the staff, unlocking painful memories of a young boy in a well.
The pagans attack Randolph with their own piece of the staff, taking his. Coulson arrests Randolph, and they discover that he is the Asgardian Berserker. He directs them to Ireland, to a church where he hid the third piece of the staff, but the pagans also find the church. The staff causes great surges of adrenalin within its users, and for Ward this comes from his memories—he had been forced by his older brother to trap their younger brother in a well. Ward manages to defeat the pagans, with the help of agent Melinda May, who can control the staff after learning to live with her own bad memories. Coulson, Jemma Simmons, and Leo Fitz manage to keep Randolph alive long enough for his Asgardian heart to heal itself, and though Coulson wishes to touch the staff himself to try and unlock memories from his death and resurrection, Randolph convinces him not to. That night, Ward turns down agent Skye's offer to talk about his past, instead going to May's hotel room.
Production
Development and writing
In October 2013, Marvel revealed that the eighth episode would be titled "The Well", and would be written by Monica Owusu-Breen, with Jonathan Frakes directing. It was originally produced as the seventh episode. Speaking to the repressed darkness Grant Ward experiences, Owusu-Breen said the darkness to a character like Ward is "inherent" continuing, "so there's something interesting about what it means to have that controlled violence and what it would be inside of you. Especially on the hero side. Where that darkness can come from was really interesting to us."
Casting
Main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively. It was revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Peter MacNicol as Professor Elliot Randolph, Michael Graziadei as Jakob Nystrom, Erin Way as Petra Larsen, Toby Wilson as Neils, Alex Neustaedter as Maynard and Sylvia Brindis as Elena. Wilson, Neustaedter, and Brindis did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Neustaedter's character, whose name is not used within the episode, would later be renamed Christian for the second season of the series.
Filming
Filming occurred from September 24 to October 3, 2013. Location shooting for the episode occurred in Downtown Los Angeles, the Ebell of Los Angeles, and Griffith Park. Various locations were considered for the Irish monastery, but they were not suitable for the required mounting necessary for the various stunts that take place in the location, so a set was constructed. Dalton broke a bone in his hand during the filming of a fight sequence, hitting it against the hard foam prop of the Asgaridan staff. As such, the injury had to be incorporated into the next episode. The episode uses footage from the 2006 Dublin riots to portray riots in Norway.
Music
Because the actual story of the episode stands apart from the episode's tie-in with Thor: The Dark World (2013), composer Bear McCreary "felt no pressure from either the producers" or himself to incorporate material from the scores for the Thor films into the episode. Instead, McCreary composed his own Asgard theme, which introduces "a new tone to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., one that embraces Marvel's fantasy roots". McCreary wrote the theme as "an old fanfare, a melody that captured the majesty of Asgardian nobility", but because of the more grounded nature of the series, and the fact that the theme was often needed for quiet dialogue scenes while MacNicol's Randolph recounts Asgardian legends, McCreary often just used the "essence" of the theme in the episode: for MacNicol's scenes, McCreary "thinned [the theme] out to subtle wisps", while English horns, bassoon, and cello quote the theme in "mysterious settings".
The anarchist group that opposes the protagonists in the episode is represented musically by "a snarling distorted synth bass, oscillating in minor thirds", which McCreary designed as a metaphor for "how their minds are altered when they touch the staff and absorb the Asgardian rage". For the series of flashbacks revolving around the titular well, McCreary used "a recurring cluster of pitches that rings disturbingly hollow. The sound is not urgently scary, nor is it sad. It leaves the audience alone to interpret the images on screen." Though he didn't consider it a theme, referring to it as the "Ward Chord", McCreary said that "it does function thematically because it recurs with each flashback, and increases tension each time."
Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins
To tie-in with the Thor: The Dark World, the episode opens with a montage of footage from the film briefly featuring Chris Hemsworth as Thor. Director Jonathan Frakes said many on the series were "so excited" about this episode being the first official tie-in with the films, and figuring out how the film assets from The Dark World would fit into the episode. However, as the episode was being edited, the amount of material diminished, resulting in the very brief opening montage.
The episode then deals with the immediate aftermath of the film, showing the series' characters literally cleaning up the mess left behind by the film's characters. Executive producer Jed Whedon explained that S.H.I.E.L.D. cleaning up after superhero events is something that has always happened, but never been depicted in the series before. Actress Bennet noted that it was not actually necessary for audiences to see the film to understand the episode. The rest of the episode's story deals with Asgardians in general. Whedon described this as the episode's story spilling "into more of the ancient aspects into Asgardians and how they visited us long ago, so we get into a little bit of that aspect of Asgard and how it's affected our planet in the past and currently." Coulson mentions that he consulted with Randolph around the events of Thor.

Controversy
Following the airing of the episode, Rajan Zed, the president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, called for an apology for its insinuation that the Hindu god Vishnu could be an alien. In a statement concerning the incident, the Society said that "faith was something sacred and attempts at debasing it hurt the adherents. Television and Hollywood should be more conscious while handling faith related subjects, as television and cinema were very mighty mediums and these could create stereotypes in the minds of some audiences." Zed elaborated that "Hinduism ... should not be taken lightly. Symbols of any faith, larger or smaller, should not be mishandled." A fictional version of Vishnu has previously appeared as a character in Marvel Comics.

In Nepal, some customary units of measurement are still used, although the metric system has been the official standard since 1968.
Length
The kos (kosh, krosh, koss) is a very ancient measure of distance, measuring about 2.25 miles or 3.7 km.
1 angul = approx. 0.75 inch
4 angul = 1 dharnugrah (bow grip) = 3 in
8 angul = 1 dhanurmushti (fist with thumb raised) = 6 in
12 angul = 1 vitastaa (span) = 9 in
2 vitastaa (cubit) = 18 in
1 haath = 1.5 ft.
1 dand or dhanush (bow) = 4 haath = 6 ft
2000 dand = 1 kos or Gorut = 4000 yards or 2.25 miles
4 kosh = 1 yojan = 9 miles = 14.48 km
Land area
The precise land measurement conversions as per Nepal standard are as follows:
In a nutshell, The following is a partial list of everyday units used to calculate land area in Nepal.
1 Khetmuri = 25 Ropani
1 Bigha (बिघा) = 20 Kattha (कठ्ठा) = 6772.63 m² = 72900 sq.ft. = 13.31 Ropani
1 Katha (कठ्ठा) = 20 Dhur (धुर) = 338.63 m² = 3645 sq.ft.
1 Dhur (धुर) = 16.93 m² = 182.25 sq.ft.
1 Ropani (रोपनी) = 16 Aana (आना) = 64 Paisa (पैसा) = 508.72 m² = 5476 sq.ft. = 256 Daam (दाम) = 4 llka
1 Aana (आना)= 4 Paisa (पैसा) = 31.80 m² = 342.25 sq. ft. = 16 Daam (दाम)
1 Paisa (पैसा) = 4 Daam (दाम) = 7.95 m² = 85.56 sq. ft.
1 Daam (दाम) = 1.99 m² = 21.39 sq. ft.
The units of measurement of area of land depends on the part of the country where they are being used, with the Bigha-Katha-Dhur measurements common in the Terai region while the Ropani-Aana measurements are common in hilly and mountainous regions.
Terai region
In the Terai region, the southern parts of Nepal, the customary units are those used elsewhere in South Asia:
1 katha = 20 dhur
1 bigha = 20 katha
Hilly and mountainous regions
A different system is used in hilly regions:
1 paisa = 4 dam (daam)
1 ana (aana) = 4 paisas
1 ropani = 16 anas
Conversions
1 ropani = 74 feet × 74 feet
1 bigha = 13 Ropani 5 Anna
1 kattha = 442 square yards or 338 square meters
Volume
10 Mutthi (fistful) = 1 Mana
8 Mana = 1 Pathi (4.54596L)
20 Pathi = 1 Muri

Bennifer is a name given by the media to the high-profile relationship between American entertainers Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. The pair had a widely publicized 18-month romance from 2002 to 2004. They collaborated on two films together during their relationship, Gigli and Jersey Girl. The pair were engaged in late 2002, but postponed their wedding before breaking up in early 2004. They rekindled their romance in May 2021 and got married in July 2022.
Early stages
Although they had crossed paths several times before (most notably at the 70th Academy Awards and at the premiere of Armageddon, both in 1998), the first major meeting of Affleck and Lopez took place in late 2001 on the set of their film, Gigli, while Lopez was still married to Cris Judd. It was rumored by the tabloids that the pair had started an affair due to their friendly and flirty ways, but they both denied these claims, stating that they were strictly just friends. After wrapping filming for the movie in March 2002, Affleck had spent a reported $18,000 on a set of half-page advertisements to express the pleasure he had working with Lopez. He had defended his reasoning for doing so, citing that he had been ashamed of his "preconceived notions" of Lopez. Later that April, it was reported that Affleck and Lopez were "cozying up" during the opening of her restaurant Madre's. Lopez and Judd separated that summer and Lopez entered a relationship with Affleck. They were photographed together in July 2002.
Engagement and romance
Lopez and Affleck's relationship garnered the first couple portmanteau name in Hollywood, 'Bennifer'. Lopez' single 'Jenny From The Block' which featured Affleck in the music video brought on even more attention to the couple, with Lopez describing it as a tabloid frenzy. After three months of dating, Affleck proposed to Lopez at his mother's home in October 2002 with a $1.2M 6.1-carat Harry Winston pink diamond ring. Later that month, Affleck and Lopez began filming their 2nd film together, Jersey Girl. Lopez dedicated her 2002 album This Is Me... Then to Affleck, stating that he was "her life and sole inspiration for every lyric. She included songs such as 'Baby I Love U!', 'I'm Glad' and 'Dear Ben' which were about her romance with Affleck. On July 18, 2003, Lopez and Affleck had their first primetime interview together on Dateline NBC. On August 1, 2003, Lopez and Affleck's box office bomb film Gigli released, being considered one of the worst films in history. After this happened, the media started to portray them in a more negative manner. As Jason Bailey in a piece for the Guardian has observed: "it's important to frame this ghastly reception within the atmosphere of the moment. Affleck and Lopez met during the film's production and quickly became an item – such a public one that, by the time it hit theaters a year later, the “Bennifer” backlash had built up quite a head of steam. They were young, impossibly good-looking, fabulously wealthy, and clearly hot for each other, so it seemed like a good time to knock them down a peg." Lopez had described the experience as overwhelming, and stated that Affleck hated the attention the pair was getting. The following month, the couple postponed their planned September 2003 wedding just days before it was set to take place due to 'excessive media attention'.
Breakup
The pair continued dating for four months before deciding to separate. The former couple's second movie, Jersey Girl, premiered two months later in March 2004, garnering another box office bomb for the pair. Affleck and Lopez remained in contact in the years after their breakup and spoke highly of each other in public. Affleck called out "sexist and racist" critics for comments about Lopez, while Lopez cited the constant media attention as one of the main reasons of their breakup. In 2008, Affleck discussed how he felt during his relationship with Lopez, saying that neither of them "anticipated" the degree of attention they would receive, saying: "we fell in love, we were excited and maybe too accessible," but pushed back against the "curious notion" that he should view the relationship as a mistake, and reflected on the prevailing tabloid culture at the time "where it's about one person and everybody focuses on them." Lopez has seconded Affleck's words, saying that the media coverage destroyed their relationship "from the inside out" and that she felt “eviscerated“ by it. In 2014, Lopez expressed that her breakup with Affleck was her "first real heartbreak," and in 2015 she stated she had "no regrets" about their relationship. In April 2021, Affleck praised Lopez for her work ethic, great talent, and success.
Aftermath
Lopez then went on to marry singer Marc Anthony five months after Lopez and Affleck split. Affleck then went on to marry actress Jennifer Garner the following year in 2005. Lopez and Anthony ended their seven-year marriage in 2011, officially divorcing in 2014 while Affleck and Garner officially announced their split in 2015, and their divorce was finalized in 2018.
Rekindled romance
In April 2021, 19 years after the start of their initial romance, it was reported that Affleck and Lopez had seen each other a couple times, two weeks after Lopez split from baseball player Alex Rodriguez. They were then photographed together for the first time since their initial romance on May 11, 2021. On May 24, 2021, Lopez and Affleck were spotted at Lopez's rental home in Miami with Affleck wearing the watch Lopez had given him in her 2002 "Jenny From The Block" music video. On June 1, 2021, Affleck and Lopez were photographed holding each other, their first public display of affection in their rekindled romance. On June 14, 2021, photos and videos of Affleck and Lopez kissing were released to the media for the first time in almost two decades, confirming that their romance was back on. Lopez publicly confirmed their rekindled relationship that July, while they were on vacation in France and Italy. On September 10, 2021, the couple had made their red carpet debut for the first time in 18 years for the premiere of Affleck's film The Last Duel during the Venice Film Festival in Italy. Both Affleck and Lopez have spoken of the gift of a second chance with each other since reuniting. For Valentine's Day, Affleck directed and gifted to Lopez, shared through her OntheJLo Email, a remix of her song On My Way He also made his second cameo appearance in an official Lopez music video: Marry Me (Ballad Version).
Lopez announced on April 8, 2022, that the pair were engaged again, 20 years after the first proposal. The couple married on July 16, 2022, filing their marriage licence in Las Vegas. Lopez legally changed her name to Jennifer Affleck and confirmed the marriage the next day. The following month, they held a wedding celebration for family and friends.

"Black Widower" (originally titled "The Return of Sideshow Bob") is the twenty-first episode of the third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 1992. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by David Silverman. Kelsey Grammer guest starred as Sideshow Bob for the second time. In the episode, Sideshow Bob — Bart's new archenemy — returns, wanting to kill Bart as revenge for sending him to jail. He instead marries Bart's aunt Selma, but when Bart later realizes that Bob is planning to kill Selma, he prevents the attempted murder and Bob is sent back to prison. "Black Widower" finished 39th in Nielsen ratings for the week that it originally aired. Reviewers generally enjoyed the episode, and gave Grammer's portrayal of Sideshow Bob particular praise.
Plot
The Simpsons prepare to have dinner with Selma and her mysterious new boyfriend, who reveals himself to be a redeemed Sideshow Bob. During dinner, Bob reveals that while he was in prison, he began building up hatred and the desire to kill Bart for exposing his crime of framing Krusty the Clown ("Krusty Gets Busted") and started plotting revenge. However, after receiving Selma's response to his "Prison Pen Pal" ad, he fell in love with her and was inspired to become a model prisoner, earning an early release.
Bob proposes to Selma and she accepts. He makes an appearance at a Krusty the Clown telethon and they reconcile. Lisa encourages Bart to forgive Bob, but Bart refuses to believe he is reformed. When Selma discovers that Bob detests her beloved MacGyver, the marriage is nearly called off until Bob takes Homer's suggestion to let Selma watch it alone while he takes a walk.
Selma reveals that she has no sense of smell or taste after a mishap with a bottle rocket and has cut back on cigarettes, smoking only after meals and episodes of MacGyver. Selma sends the Simpsons a tape of their honeymoon which captures Bob's tirade over the lack of a gas fireplace in their hotel room. While watching MacGyver, Bart realizes that Selma has one hour to live and tries to explain it to Homer unsuccessfully (with Marge realizing immediately), and the Simpsons rush to the hotel room.
When Selma retires alone to watch MacGyver, her hotel room explodes. Bob returns, expecting Selma dead, but she is unscathed and the Simpsons and the police apprehend Bob. Bart explains how he exposed Bob's scheme: Bob opened the gas valve in the hotel room, knowing Selma would not smell the leak. He left while she watched MacGyver, knowing she would light a cigarette afterwards and cause an explosion. Although Bart foiled the plot, Chief Wiggum absent-mindedly threw a match into the room after smoking a celebratory cigar, causing the explosion. Bob, vowing revenge on Bart, is led away by the police. As Selma blames herself for almost getting killed, Marge praises Bart for foiling Bob's plot and not losing his mistrust of him.
Production
"Black Widower" was written by Jon Vitti and directed by David Silverman. The staff wanted an episode involving a "mystery", so executive producer Sam Simon approached Thomas Chastain, head of the organization Mystery Writers of America, to help construct the mystery. A number of clues leading up to the revelation at the end were inserted into the script so viewers would be able to solve the mystery on their own. As the episode was being written, the writers had their eyes towards winning an Edgar Award, which is awarded by the Mystery Writers of America to the best mystery fiction in print, television and film published or produced in the past year. Despite their efforts, "Black Widower" was not nominated for an Edgar Award.
In the episode, the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote by having Sideshow Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect. For "Black Widower", director David Silverman updated the character model of Bob to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird. One of Bob's friends from jail seen in the episode is Snake Jailbird. The character first appeared in the season two episode "The War of the Simpsons" only as "Jailbird", but his full name was first mentioned in "Black Widower". The writers gave him the name Snake because of the snake tattoo on his arm, and the character has gone by that name ever since.
"Black Widower" was the second episode Kelsey Grammer guest starred in as the voice of Sideshow Bob. He had previously appeared in the season one episode "Krusty Gets Busted", in which Bart gets Bob sentenced to jail for framing Krusty for armed robbery. Grammer initially expected to voice Bob in a one-time role, but the character was amazing enough to have him brought back. Sideshow Bob eventually became one of the most popular roles Grammer ever played, and Bob became a recurring character on the show. Grammer bases his Bob voice on theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. He had once worked for Rabb, whose "lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob".
Cultural references
The episode begins with the family, except for Marge, watching a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims "It's like they saw our lives and put it right on screen," and points at the television screen. Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty says there is something "disturbing" about him, which results in Lisa's imagining him as The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is a reference to the soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the "Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program" category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Misérables. The karaoke song Selma and Sideshow Bob sings as a montage is the Frank/Nancy Sinatra duet of “Somethin' Stupid”. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty.
"Black Widower" was the second episode to show Patty and Selma's obsession with the character Angus MacGyver from the television show MacGyver, which has become a recurring joke on The Simpsons. When Sideshow Bob goes into the room to see Selma's corpse, he turns around the chair, only to see Bart sitting in it. Bob turns around and sees Selma in the doorway. These shots, from Bob turning the chair to Selma in the doorway, are a reference to the ending of the film Psycho. The music in the scene, written by composer Alf Clausen, is also a reference to Psycho. In Bart's retelling of the story at the end of the episode, Homer shouts "To the Simpsonmobile!", a reference to Batman's batmobile. When Sideshow Bob realizes he's been caught he says, "My best laid plans have gang aft agley," this is a reference to the poem To a Mouse.
Reception
In its original American broadcast, "Black Widower" finished 39th in Nielsen ratings for the week of April 6–12, 1992, making The Simpsons the third-highest rated television series on Fox that week, after Married... with Children and In Living Color.
In I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn wrote that he considered the episode a "terrific show", appreciating Grammer's work in particular, and he also enjoyed the Dinosaurs gag and Bob's reaction to MacGyver, which he remarked "make the whole thing great fun". Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict rated the episode 97%, and considered it a "timeless treat" because of Sideshow Bob's appearance, calling it "excellent from beginning to end".
Nate Meyers of the website digitallyOBSESSED rated the episode a 3(of 5). He felt the episode was "not a strong entry to the series", noting that "the love story between Bob and Selma never seems to play as well as it should". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide remarked that later episodes of The Simpsons seasons were typically of lesser quality than episodes that appeared earlier in a season because of "general tiredness and the pressure of creating so many programs". However, he found "Black Widower" an exception, noting that most episodes featuring Sideshow Bob rarely disappoint.
Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town applauded Grammer's performance as Sideshow Bob in the episode, saying he could not "get over Sideshow Bob´s evil and conniving tone of voice, all delivered in a pseudo-Anglophile accent".

The Northeast Iowa Conference (NEIC) is a six school athletic conference made up of mid-sized schools in the Northeast Corner of Iowa. The conference dates in 1920, making it one of Iowa's oldest existing athletic conferences.
Members
Departing members highlighted in red.
Waverly-Shell Rock will be removed from the NEIC as of June 30, 2023, due to an imbalance of enrollment when compared to the other members. Likely landing spots for the school include the Iowa Alliance Conference or the Mississippi Valley Conference
Invited Members
The following school districts were invited to the NEIC on April 25 for the 2023-24 school year. No school district has yet announced its intentions.
Oelwein and Osage were formerly charter members. Osage left the conference in 1958, Oelwein in 2021
History
The NEIC was founded in 1920 by seven schools in northeastern Iowa. These seven schools were Charles City, Cresco, Decorah, New Hampton, Oelwein, Osage, and Waverly. All of the schools were located in some of the largest cities in Northeastern Iowa and most were located in their respective county seats. Cedar Falls joined the league in or around 1948, pushing membership to eight. By the early-1960s, Osage and Cedar Falls had left the conference to join a more local and a larger conference, respectively. Cresco also merged with other small area schools to become Crestwood High School around this time, while the small Shell Rock district joined Waverly. The membership of the conference stayed at six for a few years until Allamakee School District in Waukon joined the conference. Membership has been the same since at least 1970. As of 2011, all of the schools are either 3A or 2A by classification, Iowa's second and third largest classes. New Hampton has been a 2A school since 2010, and Waukon moved to class 2A in 2012. 2021-22, Oelwein left for the NICL leaving the conference with 6 members

String Bass
Keyboard
The band reports directly to the AFM's 4th Regiment.
History
Predecessors
The AFM Band's precursor was known as the Royal Malta Artillery Band (RMA Band), which was established in 1890 and provided the basis for the AFM Band later on. The RMA Band itself traces its origins to the year 1800, when a band with fifes and drums formed part of the Malta Light Infantry Regiment. During the Second World War, the band was suspended as its members were serving on active duty missions on mainland Europe. Music was also provided by the Band of the 1st Battalion, The King's Own Malta Regiment, which maintained its own corps of drums alongside a brass and reed band.
AFM Band
The RMA Band was reactivated in 1943. The AFM Band was established in 1970 by Warrant officer Chircop Anthony. Today, the AFM Band is directed Warrant officer Jonathan Borg. Apart from the position of commanding officer, the AFM Band also has a president and secretary, two positions that are served by Colonel Mark Mallia AFM and Major Edric Zahra respectively.
Duties
Its repertoire of music ranges from military marches to classical and popular music. Since the 1970s, the AFM Band has been represented at various massed–band displays and organized military tattoos sponsored by the AFM, the British Army, and other music organizations. Among This is the Malta Military Tattoo, of which it is the main participant. In particular, the last decade saw the AFM Band travel to festivals in Germany, Italy, Russia, Libya, Switzerland and Scotland. It also has provided full military honours towards officials such as President George H. W. Bush and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev during the Malta Summit of 1989.

Microinsurance is the protection of low-income people (those living on between approximately $1 and $4 per day( below $4)) against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payment proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risks involved. This definition is exactly the same as one might use for regular insurance except for the clearly prescribed target market: low-income people. The target population typically consists of persons ignored by mainstream commercial and social insurance schemes, as well as persons who have not previously had access to appropriate insurance products.
The institutions or set of institutions implementing microinsurance are commonly referred to as a microinsurance scheme.
Definitions of microinsurance
Microinsurance is insurance with low premiums and low caps / coverage. In this definition, "micro" refers to the small financial transaction that each insurance policy generates. "General micro insurance product means health insurance contract, any contract covering the belongings, such as, hut, livestock or tools or instruments or any personal accident contract, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-I appended to these regulations"; and "life microinsurance product" means any term insurance contract with or without return of premium, any endowment insurance contract or health insurance contract, with or without an accident benefit rider, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-II appended to these regulations as those within defined (low) minimum and maximum caps. The Indian Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) characterizes microinsurance by the product features. This is further complemented by their definition for microinsurance agents, those appointed by and acting for an insurer, for distribution of microinsurance products (and only those products).
Microinsurance is a financial arrangement to protect low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved. The author of this definition adds that micro-insurance does not refer to: (i) the size of the risk-carrier (some are small and even informal, others very large companies); (ii) the scope of the risk (the risks themselves are by no means "micro" to the households that experience them); (iii) the delivery channel: it can be delivered through a variety of different channels, including small community-based schemes, credit unions or other types of microfinance institutions, but also by enormous multinational insurance companies, etc.
Microinsurance is synonymous to community-based financing arrangements, including community health funds, mutual health organizations, rural health insurance, revolving drugs funds, and community involvement in user-fee management. Most community financing schemes have evolved in the context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. The common feature within all, is the active involvement of the community in revenue collection, pooling, resource allocation and, frequently, service provision.
Microinsurance is the use of insurance as an economic instrument at the "micro" (i.e. smaller than national) level of society. This definition integrates the above approaches into one comprehensive conceptual framework. It was first published in 1999, pre-dating the other three approaches, and has been noted to be the first recorded use of the term "microinsurance". Under this definition, decisions in microinsurance are made within each unit, (rather than far away, at the level of governments, companies, NGOs that offer support in operations, etc.).
Insurance functions on the concept of risk pooling, and likewise, regardless of its small unit size and its activities at the level of single communities, so does microinsurance. Microinsurance links multiple small units into larger structures, creating networks that enhance both insurance functions (through broader risk pools) and support structures for improved governance (i.e. training, data banks, research facilities, access to reinsurance etc.). This mechanism is conceived as an autonomous enterprise, independent of permanent external financial lifelines, and its main objective is to pool both risks and resources of whole groups for the purpose of providing financial protection to all members against the financial consequences of mutually determined risks.
The last definition therefore, includes the critical features of the previous three:
transactions are low-cost (and reflect members' willingness to pay);
clients are essentially low-net-worth (but not necessarily uniformly poor);
the essential role of the network of microinsurance units is to enhance risk management of the members of the entire pool of microinsurance units over and above what each can do when operating as a stand-alone entity.
Microinsurance products
Microinsurance, like regular insurance, may be offered for a wide variety of risks. These include both health risks (illness, injury, or death) and property risks (damage or loss). A wide variety of microinsurance products exist to address these risks, including crop insurance and livestock/cattle insurance, which are increasingly sold as index-based insurance, theft or fire insurance, health insurance, term life insurance, death insurance, disability insurance, and insurance for natural disasters.
Microinsurance has made a significant difference in countries like Mali, as Maxime Prud'Homme and Bakary Traoré describe in Innovations in Sikasso. Still, many countries face continuing challenges. Specifically in Bangladesh, micro health insurance schemes are having trouble with financial and institutional sustainability, Syed Abdul Hamid and Jinnat Ara describe, but things are improving. Progress in Bangladesh
Microinsurance delivery models
One of the greatest challenge for microinsurance is the actual delivery to clients. Methods and models for doing so vary depending on the organization, institution, and provider involved. As Dubby Mahalanobis states, one must be thorough and careful when making policies, otherwise microinsurance could do more harm than good. Tricky challenges In general, there are four main methods for offering microinsurance the partner-agent model, the provider-driven model, the full-service model, and the community-based model. Each of these models has their own advantages and disadvantages.
Partner agent model: A partnership is formed between the micro insurance(partner as MFI) scheme and an agent (insurance companies), and in some cases a third-party healthcare provider. The microinsurance scheme is responsible for the delivery and marketing of products to the clients, while the agent retains all responsibility for design and development. In this model, microinsurance schemes benefit from limited risk, but are also disadvantaged in their limited control. Micro Insurance Centre is an example of an organization using this model.
Full service model: The microinsurance scheme is in charge of everything; both the design and delivery of products to the clients, working with external healthcare providers to provide the services. This model has the advantage of offering microinsurance schemes full control, yet the disadvantage of higher risks.
Provider-driven model: The healthcare provider is the microinsurance scheme, and similar to the full-service model, is responsible for all operations, delivery, design, and service. There is an advantage once more in the amount of control retained, yet disadvantage in the limitations on products and services.
Community-based/mutual model: The policyholders or clients are in charge, managing and owning the operations, and working with external healthcare providers to offer services. This model is advantageous for its ability to design and market products more easily and effectively, yet is disadvantaged by its small size and scope of operations.
Microinsurance scheme
A microinsurance scheme is a scheme that uses, among others, an insurance mechanism whose beneficiaries are (at least in part) people excluded from formal social protection schemes, particularly, informal economy workers and their families. The scheme differs from others created to provide legal social protection to formal economy workers. Membership is not compulsory (but can be automatic), and members pay, at least in part, the necessary contributions in order to cover benefits.
The expression "microinsurance scheme" designates either the institution that provides insurance (e.g., a health mutual benefit association) or the set of institutions (in the case of linkages) that provide insurance or the insurance service itself provided by an institution that also handles other activities (e.g., a micro-finance institution).
The use of the mechanism of insurance implies:
Prepayment and resource-pooling: the regular prepayment of contributions (before the insured risks occur) that are pooled together.
Risk-sharing: the pooled contributions are used to pay a financial compensation to those who are affected by predetermined risks, and those who are not exposed to these risks do not get their contributions back.
Guarantee of coverage: a financial compensation for a number of risks, in line with a pre-defined benefits package.
Microinsurance schemes may cover various risks (health, life, etc.); the most frequent microinsurance products are:
Life microinsurance (and retirement savings plans)
Health microinsurance (hospitalisation, primary health care, maternity, etc.)
Disability microinsurance
Property microinsurance – assets, livestock, housing
Crop microinsurance
Dirk Reinhard provides a good list summarising reading pertinent to microinsurance. Small means, massive impact
Microinsurance and development
Microinsurance is recognized as a useful tool in economic development. As many low-income people do not have access to adequate risk-management tools, they are vulnerable to fall back into poverty in times of hardship, for example when the breadwinner of the family dies, or when high hospital bills force families to take out loans with high interest rates. Furthermore, microinsurance makes it possible for people to take more risks. When farmers are insured against a bad harvest (resulting from drought), they are in a better position to grow crops which give high yields in good years, and bad yields in year of drought. Without the insurance, however, they will be inclined to do the opposite; since they have to safeguard a minimal level of income for themselves and their families, crops will be grown which are more drought resistant, but which have a much lower yield in good weather conditions.

Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is a crossover fighting video game between Mortal Kombat and the DC Comics fictional universe, developed and published by Midway Games, the last entry in the franchise before the company went bankrupt in 2009 and sold the franchise to Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is also the eighth main installment in the Mortal Kombat series, despite the story not being connected to the first seven games or any other game that was released after this one. The game was released on November 16, 2008 and contains characters from both franchises. Its story was written by comic writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. The game was followed by a Mortal Kombat reboot in 2011 and by Injustice: Gods Among Us in 2013.
The game takes place after Raiden, Earthrealm's god of thunder, and Superman, Metropolis' defender, repel invasions from both their worlds. An attack by both Raiden and Superman simultaneously in their separate universes causes the merging of the Mortal Kombat and DC villains, Shao Kahn and Darkseid, resulting in the creation of Dark Kahn, whose mere existence causes the two universes to begin merging; if allowed to continue, it would result in the destruction of both. Characters from both universes begin to fluctuate in power, becoming stronger or weaker.
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 and is available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It is the first Mortal Kombat title developed solely for the seventh generation of video game consoles. Most reviewers agreed that Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was entertaining and made good use of its DC Universe license, but the game's lack of unlockable features as opposed to past installments of Mortal Kombat and toned-down finishing moves garnered some criticism.
Gameplay
The game features a story mode, playable from two different perspectives. The perspectives consist of one segment from the DC Universe side, and one from the Mortal Kombat side, each split up into various chapters. Depending on which side players choose, the characters from one universe see those from the opposite universe as the invaders of their own. The player has the ability to play as all the characters in the story mode at one point during development, but the story mode ultimately lacked story arcs for a few characters.<ref name="MKvsDC storymode">{{cite video game|title=Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=November 16, 2008 |level=Story Mode}}</ref> Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe also contains a mode called "Kombo Challenge", where players must perform ten pre-created combos of increasing difficulty.
Intertwined within fight matches, which are played in a 3D fighter style, are new gameplay modes, such as "Free-Fall Kombat" or "Falling Kombat," which are activated automatically after throwing the opponent to a lower level in the arena. The players can fight in the air during the fall in a quasi-mini-game, with one player having to hit certain buttons to be above the other during the fall and land on the other player when the fall ends. "Klose Kombat" is a mode the players can enter during a fight, causing the characters to lock with each other and the perspective to change to a close-up shot of the two, to make for an interval of close-quarters fighting. A "Test Your Might" mini-game is also worked into the gameplay; while fighting in certain areas, the player can smash the opponent through a series of walls and engage in a tug-of-war with the damage meter at the top of the screen. The player on the offense presses buttons to increase damage given, while the player on the defense presses buttons to decrease damage taken.
Another in-fight feature called "Rage mode" is introduced in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. The Rage mode is governed by a rage meter placed below the player's health meter that fills progressively every time the player receives damage or attacks. Once the meter is completely filled, Rage mode can be activated and lasts for several seconds. Rage mode enables the player to break the opponent's guard on the second hit, prevents the attacker from experiencing hit stun, knockdown or pop-up, and increases the damage of an attacker's moves. During fights, characters show permanent signs of damage, such as bruises, scrapes, bleeding, and broken or torn clothing. All of the characters except Darkseid, Shao Kahn, and Dark Kahn have finishing moves; the Mortal Kombat characters and the DC villains can execute Fatalities, while the DC heroes can execute moves called "heroic brutalities," which function in the same manner but do not kill opponents, in order to stay in tone with the heroes who have an established reputation of never taking a life.
Plot
After Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm is halted by Raiden's forces of light, Raiden blasts and sends Kahn through a portal. At exactly the same time on Earth, Superman stops Darkseid's Apokoliptian invasion by blasting Darkseid with his heat vision as he enters a boom tube. These acts do not destroy either of them, but merge them into Dark Kahn, and causes the DC and Mortal Kombat universes to merge. As this happens, the characters' abilities fluctuate, causing violent "rage" outbreaks that are actually the feelings of Dark Kahn being infused in the characters from afar. Because of this, certain characters gain either strength or vulnerability. This allows for such things as the possibility of Superman being defeated due to his vulnerability to magic, and giving the Joker the ability to fight skilled martial artists such as his nemesis Batman and Deathstroke. With each world thinking that the other is responsible for the merger, they fight each other until only one fighter from each side remains: Raiden and Superman. In the final battle, the two fight while Dark Kahn feeds on their rage. Both realizing that neither is working with Dark Kahn, Raiden and Superman overcome their rage for each other and defeat their fused enemy, restoring the two worlds to their normal separation. While everyone else has been sent to their original universe, Darkseid and Shao Kahn have been switched and are both rendered powerless. In the end, they both face eternal imprisonment in the other's universe; Darkseid is restrained in the Netherrealm, while Shao Kahn is trapped in the Phantom Zone.

DevelopmentMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was Midway Games's last project before filing for bankruptcy and selling the rights to Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in 2009. In February 2007, Midway Games announced they were planning a new game in the Mortal Kombat franchise, inspired by seeing a showcase of Gears of War. "Mortal Kombat 8" would have been "dark, gritty, serious" and a "back to basics reboot" of the series. Eventually, during the planning process, a deal with DC Comics was made and this project was cancelled, thus leading to the development of a different game. An announcement in April 2008 confirmed the game as a crossover, and a trailer was released. The only notable aspect that remained from the original project was the use of the Unreal Engine 3, also used in Gears of War.Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was co-published by Midway Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and was the final Mortal Kombat title to be developed under the Midway label prior to its purchase by Warner Bros. Interactive. Midway used AutoDesk software to develop Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, according to Maurice Patel, entertainment industry manager at AutoDesk, and Illuminate Labs products for lighting.
The use of a DC license imposed some restrictions on the characteristic violence in Mortal Kombat games. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was thus restricted to a "Teen" ESRB rating. Therefore, certain Fatalities such as Sub-Zero's "Spine Rip" were excluded or replaced due to their graphic nature. In order to keep that rating, two of the Fatalities in the game were censored in North America. In the United Kingdom version, both the Joker and Deathstroke's first Fatality depict them each finishing their opponent with a gunshot to the head, both shown uncut from a distance. The North American version has the camera quickly pan toward the victor before the shot is fired, thereby cutting the victim out of the shot completely. Additionally, one of Kitana's Fatalities which involved impaling the opponent in the head and the torso with her fanblades was modified so that both fanblades impaled her opponent's chest instead.
According to interviews, the characters were chosen for their popularity, and for parallels between them from both universes. Ed Boon, creative director of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and co-creator of the Mortal Kombat franchise, has said that some of the characters' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been toned down to make them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed that two new characters were developed as downloadable content, Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also hinted earlier at the prospect of Kung Lao and Doomsday being downloadable characters.
For the release of the Kollector's Edition of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, a new cover was created by Alex Ross. Also included in the Kollector's Edition is a 16-page comic book prequel, Beginnings, which was illustrated by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias.
Downloadable content (DLC) had been confirmed by Major Nelson, but was canceled due to Midway's financial issues. Ed Boon had stated that they would have been updating Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe periodically with new content all the way up to the release of the next installment of the Mortal Kombat series: "I'd like to have [DLC] as soon as possible. I think that might be a great Christmas gift to reinvigorate the game". Ed Boon said on his Twitter account that the plan for DLC had been scrapped, which occurred because, as clarified by 1UP, Midway had filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Warner Bros. Interactive after the suggestion of downloadable content.
ReceptionMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Adam Sessler of X-Play stated: "Whether it's a decade-late answer to the Marvel vs. Capcom team up games or an off-the-cuff boardroom joke gone wildly too far, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is destined to make just about anyone's shortlist of bizarre video game team-ups. Still, sometimes two disparate things can merge to create a unique synergy that makes the melding work, however unlikely it may have seemed at the outset." In GamePro, Sid Shuman called it "surprisingly enjoyable." Wired.com's preview stated that the concept of the game was "nose-pokingly ludicrous", noting that Superman's powers could be used to easily defeat a character with the comment, "from Sub-Zero to Well-Done in eight seconds flat." ABC News praised the game's story because it did "a great job of giving players a cohesive, if far-fetched, story line that's fun if not engaging," as well as "comic book-like" dialogue. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universes Kombo Challenge mode was criticized as a thin and frustrating mode with combos that required very precise timing. The modes of Klose Kombat and Free-Fall Kombat were praised as concepts but were criticized in their execution as they appeared to slow the gameplay down and took the player out of the fast gameplay experience. Critics noted that the change in the amount of gore was disappointing to longtime fans of the series who were used to the "insane amounts of gore."
The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry approved of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe because of its departure from the earlier M-rated games of the series praising its "simpler play, familiar graphics and adjustable gore content" but still not recommending it for younger players. In 2008, GamePro, ranked it as the 15th best fighting game out of 18.
Midway Games announced that as of January 26, 2009, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe had shipped 1.8 million copies since its release in mid-November 2008, not including the sales of the Kollector's Edition. The chief operating officer of GameStop stated that the Kollector's Edition of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe made up 55% of the game's total sales at GameStop locations in its first week. In their 10-K filing, Midway Games revealed the title had sold over 1.9 million units, making it one of the company's most successful titles since 2002. According to Wired.com, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe also "holds the distinction of being the most pre-ordered MK game of all time." In a ranking by Rentrak, the Xbox 360 version of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was the sixth most rented game of 2009.
Legacy
Midway's work on Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe's cinematic story mode would influence development of future Mortal Kombat games and the Injustice series after Midway filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and became NetherRealm Studios. Future fighting games like Guilty Gear Xrd, Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, and Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite'' attempted to create similar film-like experiences.

The Hibbert Trust was founded by Robert Hibbert (1769–1849) and originally designated the Anti-Trinitarian Fund. It came into operation in 1853, awarded scholarships and fellowships, supports the Hibbert Lectures, and maintained (from 1894) a chair of ecclesiastical history at Manchester College.
Robert Mortimer Montgomery, who became a member of the Hibbert Trust in 1914, served as its Chairman from 1929 until three weeks before his death, in 1948.

Richmond Hill is an ecumenical fellowship, residence and urban retreat center. The St. John's Church Historic District in Richmond, Virginia includes several churches of various denominations, including this former Catholic convent and school which is a contributing property that continues to address the area's spiritual and educational needs.
History
In 1737, explorer and future planter William Byrd II named the future city from near this site on the highest of Richmond's hills. It overlooks the James River near its fall-line and faces the setting sun. The view reminded Byrd of his home Richmond-on-Thames. Native peoples called the area Tsenacomoco. Byrd commissioned Col. William Mayo to survey and lay out a city, and the survey lines remain in legal descriptions to this day.
The area known alternately as Church Hill or Richmond Hill was first developed by Richard Adams, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, beginning in 1769. Adams built a house, probably across the street from the current property, when Richmond was declared Virginia's capital in 1779. British troops occupied the wood frame house during the American Revolution. Around 1810, another house was added to the property, in the Federal style. Because of Adams' social standing, several correspondents described parties in the house. By 1844, the court clerk, Palmer, owned the house, which he sold in 1859 to William Taylor. Taylor transformed the house into an Italianate-style brick and stucco mansion. The building grew from six to 20 rooms, as well as added another storey. Richard A. Wilkins, a Virginian who had returned from operating a sugar plantation in Louisiana to educate his children, bought the property in 1860 for $20,000. His wife operated a hospital for recovering soldiers in the mansion during the Civil War, and their son watched battles from the cupola. After the Confederate capital fell in 1865, a Union general used it as his headquarters, and relegated the Taylors to the upper floor. They sold it to the Catholic bishop and moved to Tennessee.
After the war ended, Catholic Bishop John McGill requested nuns from the Archdiocese of Baltimore, to pray for the devastated city as well as to educate girls. The first order to respond was the Sisters of the Visitation, whose superior, Mother Mary Baptista, was a native of Norfolk, Virginia and sister of Father Alexander Hitzelberger (who joined the Jesuits after serving in Norfolk and Petersburg).
Although the Sisters of the Visitation were generally a contemplative order in Europe, for more than sixty years they ran an elite boarding and day school on this site, which they named Monte Maria. Other nuns who responded (and opened schools at different locations within Richmond) included the Daughters of Charity (whose school was at St. Patrick's on the opposite side of the hill/St. John's Church), and Benedictine nuns from Pennsylvania who taught at St. Mary's parochial school (also briefly staffed by the School Sisters of Notre Dame).
In 1895, following a donation from Thomas Fortune Ryan, the Visitation order built a Romanesque revival style brick chapel and service building to the east of the original Taylor House. In 1900 they enclosed the buildings and gardens with a high brick wall. In 1923 a three-story brick dormitory with Colonial Revival details was built between the house and chapel. Some smaller buildings on the property, and the old Adams mansion, were demolished circa 1929. A bequest from the Mother Superior in 1927 allowed the Visitation nuns to close the school and concentrate on their contemplative activities, so the sisters renovated the dormitories into individual cells. The nuns also produced the sacramental bread for local parishes, and even the Atlantic Fleet during the Second World War. In 1952 a print shop was added in a cinder block wing that replaced a small porch on the building's west side. In 1955 they removed the cupola, fearing a lightning strike similar to that at Trinity United Methodist Church. Although the order renovated the chapel consistent with the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the nuns were aging and the order needed to further consolidate its properties. In 1985, the sisters decided the sell the property and build a monastery in rural Rockville, Hanover County.
Current use
The historic district designation interfered with some developers' plans, and many in the community wanted to preserve both the historic structure and its spiritual mission. In February, 1986, a non-profit corporation was formed by an ecumenical group which included members of 15 denominations. It purchased the Monte Maria property the following November following a strange series of coincidences. Renovated and renamed Richmond Hill, the residential community and conference center continues the practice of daily prayers for Richmond and the surrounding metropolitan area, and works for personal spiritual development and interracial harmony. The debt to purchase the property was paid off in 2012.

The Algiers putsch ( or ), also known as the Generals' putsch (Putsch des généraux), was a failed coup d'état intended to force French President Charles de Gaulle not to abandon French Algeria, along with the resident European community and pro-French Muslims. Organised in French Algeria by retired French Army generals Maurice Challe (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), Edmond Jouhaud (former Inspector General of the French Air Force), André Zeller (former Chief of Staff of the French Army) and Raoul Salan (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), it took place from the afternoon of 21 to 26 April 1961 in the midst of the Algerian War (1954–1962).
The organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debré's government had started with the anti-colonialist National Liberation Front (FLN). General Salan stated that he joined the coup without concerning himself with its technical planning; however, it has always been considered a four-man coup d'état, or as De Gaulle famously put it, "un quarteron de généraux en retraite" ("a quartet of generals in retirement").
The coup was to come in two phases: an assertion of control in French Algeria's major cities Algiers, Oran and Constantine. The metropolitan operation would be led by Colonel Antoine Argoud, with French paratroopers descending on strategic airfields. The commanders in Oran and Constantine, however, refused to follow Challe's demand that they join the coup. At the same time information about the metropolitan phase came to Prime Minister Debré's attention through the intelligence service.
On 22 April all flights and landings were forbidden in Parisian airfields; an order was given to the Army to resist the coup "by all means". The following day, President De Gaulle made a famous speech on television, dressed in his World War II uniform (he was 70 years old and long since a civilian head of state) ordering the French people and military to help him.
Context
The majority of the French people had voted in favor of Algerian self-determination during the disputed referendum of 8 January 1961 organised in metropolitan France. The wording of the referendum was "Do you approve the Bill submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic concerning the self-determination of the Algerian population and the organisation of the public power in Algeria prior to self-determination".
French citizens living abroad or serving abroad in the military were allowed to vote, as were all adult Algerians, regardless of ancestry, in a single electoral college. Speaking for the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (the political arm of the FLN), Ferhat Abbas called for a boycott of the referendum, as did 16 retired French generals and factions among the pied noir (French settler) community opposed to independence. Self-determination was approved by 75% of voters overall and 69.5% in Algeria. The government reported voter turnout of 92.2%. Other sources claim that four out of ten of the individuals in France and Algeria entitled to vote abstained.
Following the outcome of the referendum, Michel Debré's government started secret negotiations with the GPRA. On 25 January 1961 Col. Antoine Argoud visited with Premier Debré and threatened him with a coup directed by a "colonels' junta"; the French Army was in no way disposed to let the French Algerian départements created in 1848 after the 1830 conquest become independent.
Chronology
On 22 April 1961, the retired generals Maurice Challe, André Zeller and Raoul Salan, helped by colonels Antoine Argoud, Jean Gardes and civilians Joseph Ortiz and Jean-Jacques Susini (who would later form the pro-colonialist OAS terrorist group), took control of the territory's capital, Algiers. General Challe criticised what he saw as the government's treason and lies toward French Algerian colonists and loyalist Muslims who trusted it, and stated that
During the night the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1e REP), composed of 1,000 men and headed by Hélie de Saint Marc, took control of all of Algiers' strategic points in three hours. The units directly involved in the putsch were the 1st and 2nd REP, the 1er REC and the 14th and 18th Regiments of Chasseurs Parachutistes. Together they comprised the elite units of the airborne divisions of the French Army. Initially, there were pledges of support from other regiments (the 27th Dragoons, the 94th Infantry, the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs and several Marine infantry units), but these seem to have reflected the views of senior officers only and there was no active participation.
The head of the Parisian police, Maurice Papon, and the director of the Sûreté nationale, formed a crisis cell in a room of the Comédie-Française, where Charles de Gaulle was attending a presentation of Racine's Britannicus. The president was informed during the entracte of the coup by Jacques Foccart, his general secretary of African and Malagasy Affairs and closest collaborator, in charge of covert operations.
Algiers' population was awakened on 22 April at 7:00 am to a message read on the radio: "The army has seized control of Algeria and of the Sahara". The three rebel generals—Challe, Jouhaud, and Zeller—had the government's general delegate, Jean Morin, arrested as well as the National Minister of Public Transport, Robert Buron, who was visiting, and several civil and military authorities. Several regiments put themselves under the command of the insurrectionary generals.
Gen. Jacques Faure, six other officers and several civilians were simultaneously arrested in Paris. At 5:00 pm, during the ministers' council, Charles de Gaulle declared: "Gentlemen, what is serious about this affair is that it isn't serious". He then proclaimed a state of emergency in Algeria, while left-wing parties, the trade union CGT and the NGO Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, Human Rights League) called to demonstrate against the military's coup d'état.
The following day, on Sunday 23 April, Gen. Salan arrived in Algeria from Spain and refused to arm civilian activists. At 8:00 pm President de Gaulle appeared in his 1940s vintage military uniform on television, calling on French military personnel and civilians, in metropolitan France or in Algeria, to oppose the putsch:
Due to the popularity of a recent invention, transistor radio, de Gaulle's call was heard by the conscript soldiers, who refused en masse to follow the professional soldiers' call for insurgency and in some cases jailed their officers. The putsch met with widespread opposition, largely in the form of civil resistance, including a one-hour general strike called by the trade unions the day after de Gaulle's broadcast. Within the army itself much depended on the position taken by individual senior officers. The 13th Light Division of Infantry, responsible for the strategic Zone Sud Oranais (south Oran zone) and including Foreign Legion units, followed the lead of its commander, Gen. Philippe Ginestet, in remaining loyal to the government in Paris. Ginestet was subsequently assassinated by the OAS in retaliation.
On Tuesday 25 April government authorities in Paris ordered the explosion of the atomic bomb Gerboise Verte (lit. "green jerboa") in the Sahara as part of a scheduled testing program. Gerboise Verte exploded at 6:05 am. While the test and test site were already prepped as part of the French national nuclear program, the test timeline appears to have been accelerated to ensure that the security of the device was not compromised.
The few military units which had followed the mutinying generals progressively surrendered. Gen. Challe gave himself up to the authorities on 26 April, and was immediately transferred to metropolitan France. The putsch had been successfully quashed, but Article 16 granting full and extraordinary powers to de Gaulle was maintained for five months. "The Battle of the Transistors"—as it was called by the press—was quickly and definitively won by de Gaulle.
Casualties
The only known fatality was French Army Sgt. Pierre Brillant, who was killed by the parachutists while defending the radio transmitter at Ouled Fayet, Algiers. Brillant was aiming at 1st REP 3rd Company Capt. Estoup when he was shot by a legionnaire.
Trials and amnesty
A military court condemned Challe and André Zeller to 15 years in prison. However, they were granted an amnesty and had their military positions restored five years later. Raoul Salan and Jouhaud escaped. Salan was condemned in absentia to death (later commuted to life sentence), as was Jouhaud. Salan and others later founded the OAS, a terrorist paramilitary organization that attempted to stop the ongoing process of the April 1962 Independence Evian Agreements for the Algerian territories of France. A July 1968 act granted amnesty; the 24 November 1982, law reintegrated the surviving generals into the army. Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud and six other generals benefitted from this law.
Theories involving CIA and BND involvement
Suggestions began to appear in French media that the perpetrators might have the backing of reactionary elements in president Kennedy's administration, particularly the CIA. A day after the rebelling generals completed the takeover of Algeria, Italian newspaper Il Paese first editorialized that "It's not by chance that some people in Paris are accusing the American secret service headed by Allen Dulles of having participated in the plot of the four ‘ultra' generals.” The next day in Russia Pravda stated that the mutiny was encouraged by NATO, the Pentagon and the CIA. Reports appeared claiming that the rumor was partly spread by or at the encouragement of minor officials in the Elysée Palace. French officials seemed to want to put out the story that "the generals plot was backed by strongly anti-communist elements in the United States Government and military services." Within days Le Monde ran a front-page editorial that the CIA involvement was rogue and not politically approved: “It now seems established that some American agents more or less encouraged [Maurice] Challe.... President Kennedy, of course knew nothing of all this". Subsequently President John F. Kennedy, through his White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger's meeting with French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville, reassured de Gaulle that the plot was not backed by the CIA or any other U.S. government entity. The next day M. de Murville appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to testify that there was no evidence of U.S. complicity. U.S. President John F. Kennedy himself contacted de Gaulle to pledge his support, including military assistance, if needed. President de Gaulle declined Kennedy's offer, fearing any controversy if American troops shot any French counterparts.
Il Paese Sera was financed directly by the Communist Party of Italy who had unofficial editorial control. Its editor, Mario Malloni, was a member of the Soviet-backed World Peace Council. IPS, it has been said, "consistently released and reported anti-American and pro-Soviet bloc stories which are either distorted or entirely false." During a June 1961 hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary in the United States Senate, Richard Helms testified that the article published by il Paese was likely part of a Soviet propaganda campaign designed to divide the U.S. and French governments.
There were other claims of foreign support: French journalist Patrick Pesnot contended that the French generals also had the support of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (West German Federal Intelligence Service) leader and Dulles protégé Reinhard Gehlen. However, Gen. Challe himself always contended that he had never been in contact with any foreign countries in this affair.

McHale's Navy is a 1997 American military comedy film starring Tom Arnold. It is based on the 1962-1966 television series of the same title. Ernest Borgnine was the only member of the original television show's cast to appear in the film.
Plot
On the Island of San Moreno, a trio of important-looking men (a Chinese militant, a Russian General, and a European businessman) are meeting with the island's governor. After paying him a suitcase full of money for a special operation, the three men are joined, via helicopter, by Major Jake McPherson Vladakov, the second best terrorist in the world, who will oversee the operation. This entire event is witnessed by a young boy named Roberto who takes pictures of the governor, the Major, and his men.
The next morning finds retired Lt. Commander Quinton McHale making his way to the Naval base of San Ysidro, where he does some trading with the officers. Such goods and services include selling home-brewed beer, ice cream, and swimsuit calendars to the men of the San Ysidro Naval Base in exchange for things like medicine and satellite photos to help the people of San Moreno. The satellite photos are his way of spying on the opposing children's baseball team. Stationed at the base are his old crew: Virgil, a cigar-chomping ladies' man and gunner; Happy, the team lookout who lives in a treehouse; Willie, the team techie and moonshine maker; Gruber, a slightly portly card-player and cigar hoarder; and Christy, the group's musclehead who can unscrew a bottle cap with his eye.
However, Captain Wallace B. Binghamton and Lieutenant Penelope Carpenter command the base now. Capt. Binghamton believes his men have gone native and confiscates all the products McHale has sold them. He wants to resurrect his career after having mistakenly sunk a luxury cruise liner, for which he is famously known.
Vladakov takes control of the baseball field and beach on San Moreno to set up his base of operations. After Roberto inadvertently alerts Vladakov to McHale's presence, (mostly thanks to the jersey that McHale gave him and the team), Vladakov uses his new stealth boat to blow up McHale's home and nearly destroys his PT-73, a decommissioned PT Boat, which reveals that they have a bad history with each other. When the governor tells Vladakov that his operations are disrupting the lives of the villagers, Vladakov and his men invade the village during their fiesta, blowing it up, and displacing everyone that lived there.
At the Pentagon, Cobra, an admiral, finds out about Vladakov's presence on San Moreno and instructs Binghamton to stand down in favor of McHale, revealing that he was once a highly decorated, top covert operative. This shocks Binghamton, but he relays the message to McHale. McHale rejects the mission, saying he wants nothing to do with it, or with Binghamton. Upon learning that the village was destroyed, McHale accepts the assignment with the stipulations that he be given his old crew, men stationed at San Ysidro, and complete autonomy from Binghamton. Binghamton appears to agree but enlists Ensign Charles Parker (David Alan Grier) to spy on McHale. Slowly both Parker and Carpenter realize that Binghamton is an incompetent officer.
McHale sets up a camp site for the villagers and, after invading Vladakov's base to find out what's going on, heads to Cuba for supplies to fix the re-commissioned PT-73 and to combat Vladakov. McHale and his crew use a pirated variety show broadcast to prevent Vladakov from stealing missile launch codes and entertain the villagers. Binghamton, tired of sitting on the side lines, attempts an attack on Vladakov's base but upon arrival, it is vacated and shown to be a front. Vladakov has killed the men that hired him to blow up The Pentagon as his motives are finally revealed. He was monitoring communications between McHale and Cobra and is aware that Cobra is en route to San Moreno to help take out Vladakov.
Vladakov attempts to kill Cobra using his stealth boat. Roberto is aboard and he tries to short out the boat to no avail. He is captured by Vladakov, but manages to jump ship. After Ensign Parker saves Roberto, McHale successfully kills Vladakov using a torpedo he bought in Cuba, as revenge for Vladakov killing Roberto's father in Panama. Cobra lands safely and reveals that he is McHale's father, none other than now Admiral Quinton McHale, Sr. and former WWII era commander of the PT-73.
Finally, the film ends with the commendations of McHale's crew, and the promotions of Lt. Carpenter and Ensign Parker, the US Navy rebuilding the baseball field, McHale re-retiring so that he may pursue a relationship with Carpenter, and Binghamton's apparent demotion to umpire for a kids' baseball game.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 3% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 2.01/10 and the consensus: "About as funny as a keelhauling, McHale's Navy will leave most viewers feeling they've been the victim of a particularly dishonorable discharge." Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C+" on scale of A to F.
Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in a very negative review: "By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch."
Leonard Klady of Variety wrote: "Time and adapters have not been kind to the fun-loving series."
Awards
McHale's Navy was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Remake or Sequel, losing to Speed 2: Cruise Control. It won the awards for Worst Actor (Arnold) and Worst Resurrection of a TV Show at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

Shuna (Gaelic Siuna) is one of the Slate Islands lying east of Luing on the west coast of Scotland.
History
In 1815, James Yates, a Glasgow native living in Woodville in Devon, bought the island from Colonel McDonald of Lynedale. In 1829 Yates bequeathed the island in trust to the magistrates and council of Glasgow, with profits from the estate divide two fifths to the city, two fifths to Glasgow University and one fifth to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. This was disputed by Yates' heir, who accepted £300 from the trustees to settle his claim. The revenue from the island was scarce and the trustees sold it in 1911.
Shuna Castle was built as recently as 1911. It fell into disrepair in the 1980s when the cost of maintenance become too great.
Unlike the other Slate Islands, Shuna has little slate, and has historically been farmed, although it is now overgrown with woodland. There are several cairns in the south and west of the small island.
During the nineteenth century the population numbered up to 69, but by the 2001 census, Shuna was one of four Scottish islands with a population of one. The island has been privately owned by the Gully family since 1946. It is now occupied by a farmer and his family, who let four houses as holiday cottages and had a usually resident population of 3 in 2011.
Wildlife
The island has healthy populations of red, roe and fallow deer; along with otters, common and grey seals, porpoises and dolphins out on the water.

Wake Me When It's Over is a 1960 DeLuxe Color comedy film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Ernie Kovacs and Dick Shawn in CinemaScope. The screenplay concerns a World War II veteran who gets called back into service by mistake and sent to a dreary Pacific island. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Howard Singer.
Plot
Gus Brubaker (Dick Shawn) is a self-described schnook. Soon after the end of the Korean War, his wife talks him into applying for G.I. insurance for which he is eligible from his World War II service with the Air Force. Gus is reluctant because he was shot down and became a prisoner of war, but the military listed him as killed. A red-tape foulup results in Gus being back in uniform, assigned to a ramshackle radar station on a backwater island near Shima, Japan. Boredom has made the airmen assigned there apathetic, slovenly, and unmotivated. Its equipment and supplies are a collection of junk, abandoned or surplus.
Capt. Charlie Stark (Ernie Kovacs), a free-wheeling nonconformist Air Force pilot, is in charge. His superiors have all but forgotten the base is still on the island. Gus gets to know Ume Tanaka (Nobu McCarthy), daughter of the village's unfriendly mayor, who shows him a pool of natural hot springs. Gus and Charlie conspire to open a resort hotel, using the men as labor and the broken-down equipment as materials, with Doc Farringtom (Warden) scamming journalist Joab Martinson (Robert Emhardt) about the water's "healing powers" to gain free publicity.
Doc summons no-nonsense Lt. Nora McKay (Margo Moore) to lend a woman's touch to the project, and Charlie develops a romantic interest in her. The airmen, including Charlie, are motivated by the project and their pretty young lieutenant, become a military outfit again, and construct a first-class facility, the Hotel Shima. Nora staffs the hotel with 40 young women from the village, and following local custom, the girls are "sold" for two years to Gus as their "papa-san" at the insistence of their fathers. Nora and Charlie fall in love, but when he asks her to marry him, she is doubtful that he is marriage material.
When Martinson gets drunk and embarrasses himself in front of all the guests, he vindictively writes a story painting the hotel as a den of sin. Gus is court-martialed as a scapegoat despite the fact that 100 airmen are its owners. When Charlie becomes outraged and demands to testify, he is transferred by his reputation-conscious commander to prevent it. A congressional panel from Washington, DC also launches an investigation, Charlie ends up buzzing the trial in a jet as Doc Farrington blackmails Colonel Hollingsworth with the knowledge that he received Hotel Shima-supplied luxury goods. Stark ends up testifying on Gus's behalf while all sorts of crazy antics occur during the trial.
Ultimately, Brubaker is found not guilty on one count, but guilty of taking government property. During sentencing, the court discovers it has tried the wrong man due to the earlier government error. Stymied, the panel finally decides to find Gus not guilty and leave the hotel to the people of the island. Charlie and Nora reconcile from an earlier disagreement over the trial and decide to marry. As Gus says goodbye to Ume and sets off to leave, he sees that Colonel Hollingsworth (now demoted to sergeant) has been assigned to the base in his place. Ume waves goodbye as Gus starts for home.

Keith Kensel Owens (born May 31, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association. The forward played one season with the Lakers in the 1991–92 season. He played college basketball for four seasons for the UCLA Bruins from 1987 through 1991.
Early life
Owens was born in San Francisco, California. He was and played center in high school at Birmingham High in Van Nuys, California.
College career
Owens was more concerned with his education than being able to play basketball. He rejected athletic scholarship offers from Cal Poly Pomona and Hawaii. He attended college at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) instead, where he made the Bruins basketball team in his first year in 1987 as a walk-on under coach Walt Hazzard. However, Owens played so infrequently that year that he calculated his points and rebounds by the minute rather than by the game. By his sophomore year under new coach Jim Harrick, Owens earned a scholarship. He became an integral part of the team in his final two seasons. In his senior year, he was co-captain of the team and averaged 6.3 points and 5.3 rebounds a game and blocked 61 shots. Harrick called Owens "the best post defender we have—a real force for us."
Professional career
Owens made the Los Angeles Lakers roster for the 1991–92 season after beginning on their Summer Pro League team. After being waived by the Lakers before the following season in October 1992, he played in France in 1992–93 with Montpellier Paillade Basket in the Ligue Nationale de Basket. Owens returned to the United States and played in the Continental Basketball Association in 1993–94, splitting the season between the Oklahoma City Cavalry and the Fargo-Moorhead Fever, averaging 13.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per game that year. Afterwards, he went to Spain for a stint with Joventut Badalona in the Liga ACB.
Later years
Owens co-hosted the show Bruin Talk on Fox Sports West in 2000, interviewing UCLA athletes and coaches.

Banjo, of the Overflow is a poem by Australian poet Francis Kenna. It was first published in The Bulletin magazine on 27 August 1892 in reply to fellow poets Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson and Edward Dyson. This poem formed part of the Bulletin Debate, a series of works by Lawson, Paterson, and others, about the true nature of life in the Australian bush.
In Up The Country, Lawson had criticised "City Bushmen" such as Banjo Paterson who tended to romanticise bush life. Paterson, in turn, accused Lawson of representing bush life as nothing but doom and gloom. Kenna's poem is a parody of Paterson's popular work, Clancy of the Overflow, playfully pointing out the irony of a city-dweller writing poems about life in the country. The author of the poem was initially credited only as "K."

The Lake States Transportation Division (LSTD) was a wholly owned division of the Soo Line Railroad that existed from 1986 until 1987. The bankruptcy of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) saw Soo Line acquire its routes to add trackage between Chicago and the Twin Cities in 1985. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) mandated that Soo Line must divest of some lines in the interest of preserving competition.
Soo Line created the LSTD on February 10, 1986 to operate the original Soo Line mainline from Forest Park, Illinois to Minneapolis via Withrow, Minnesota, as well as from Withrow to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and branch lines from Argonne, Wisconsin to Neenah, Wisconsin and former Milwaukee Road branch lines from Green Bay to Milwaukee. The LSTD was around long.
The Canadian Pacific Railway's Soo Line subsidiary operated the LSTD with tri-weekly service on main lines and less frequently on branch lines. The entire LSTD was sold to newly formed Wisconsin Central Ltd. in 1987 for $133 million as per the ICC ruling. The WC was acquired by the Canadian National Railway in 2001 and the CN became the dominant operator of trains on its Chicago-Minneapolis mainline.

Clancy Sigal (September 6, 1926 – July 16, 2017) was an American writer, and the author of dozens of essays and seven books, the best-known of which is the autobiographical novel Going Away (1961).
Early life and education
Sigal was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a poor family. His father, Leo Sigal, and mother, Jennie Persily, were both labor organizers; He "acquired his chutzpah and resilience in 30s Chicago," Kim Howells wrote in The Guardian, "raised by his tough Jewish mother in a neighborhood blighted by gangsters, poverty and violence." He later wrote a book about his mother, A Woman of Uncertain Character (2007). There he describes joining the Communist Party at 15. Marc Cooper, reviewing the book for the Los Angeles Times, explained that "Nothing, he figured, could be a greater affront to Jennie, who was an ardent socialist but an even more ardent anti-Communist." During World War II, "The army saved my life," he later wrote. The high point of his time as a soldier in Occupied Germany, he later said, came when "I went AWOL to the Nuremberg War Crimes trial bent on shooting Hermann Goering." After the war he worked as an organizer in Detroit for the autoworkers' union, but was expelled in a purge of communists and fellow travelers. He then moved to Los Angeles and enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under the G.I. Bill; he was managing editor of the student newspaper, the Daily Bruin. His "drinking buddies," he later wrote, "included the later Watergate conspirators, Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, the latter of whom reported me regularly to the FBI."
Career
After graduating from UCLA in 1950, he got a job at Columbia Pictures, but was fired by Columbia boss Harry Cohn for making copies of radical leaflets on studio equipment (he dropped the leaflets over Los Angeles from an airplane). He then went to work as a Hollywood agent, during the blacklist years of the 1950s—the basis of his memoir Black Sunset. He was subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he wrote in that book, but his hearing was abruptly cancelled. Soon after, in 1957, he left Los Angeles and the U.S.—the story he told in Going Away—and settled in Great Britain.
In 1961 he published Going Away. The book is set in 1956 and tells the story of the author's drive from Los Angeles to New York "to look at America and figure out why it isn't my country any longer." It won a National Book Award nomination. John Leonard later wrote in the New York Times: "Better than any other document I know, Going Away identified, embodied and re‐created the postwar American radical experience. It was as if On the Road had been written by somebody with brains.... (Sigal's) intelligence is always ticking. His ear is superb. His sympathies are promiscuous. His sin is enthusiasm."
In London he lived with Doris Lessing, with whom he had a four-year affair. She portrayed him as "Saul Green" in The Golden Notebook. He later wrote about those years in The Secret Defector. The New York Times Book Review declared about that book, "Lenin and Stalin may have fallen, but Mr. Sigal still stands, dispensing his memories of the left with wit, irony and sheer pratfall comedy." In London he ran an underground operation for U.S. Army deserters, which he later wrote about for the London Review of Books. He was also part of the Philadelphia Association experiment with R. D. Laing at Kingsley Hall, drawing on his experiences there for his satirical novel Zone of the Interior. The novel could not find a British publisher in the 1970s willing to risk the libel laws.
Sigal was The Observer correspondent for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and after 30 years in England decided to return to Los Angeles after falling in love there with writer Janice Tidwell. They soon married, and became a screenwriting team. Together they wrote the screenplay for the Oscar-winning 2002 Salma Hayek film Frida. In 2016 he published his Hollywood memoir, Black Sunset: Hollywood Sex, Lies, Glamour, Betrayal and Raging Egos. "The beauty of Black Sunset," Paul Buhle wrote in the Los Angeles Review of Books, "will be found in the details, lovingly or painfully described, page after page . . . Clancy Sigal brings the innocent and guilty back, once more, at close range, and proves himself the liveliest of literary nonagenarians in the process."
His final book, The London Lover: My Weekend that Lasted Thirty Years, a memoir of his London years, was published in 2018.

Personal life
Sigal's first marriage, to Margaret Walters in 1980, ended in divorce in 1989. In 1995, Sigal had a son, Joseph, with his second wife, Janice Tidwell. Sigal died July 16, 2017, in Los Angeles, California, of congestive heart failure.

Richard George Fariña (Spanish IPA: ) (March 8, 1937 – April 30, 1966) was an American folksinger, songwriter, poet and novelist.
Early years and education
Fariña was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States, the son of an Irish mother, Theresa Crozier, and a Cuban father of Galician origin, also named Richard Fariña. He grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and attended Brooklyn Technical High School. He earned an academic scholarship to Cornell University, starting as an engineering major, but later switching to English. While at Cornell he published short stories for local literary magazines and for national periodicals, including Transatlantic Review and Mademoiselle. Fariña became good friends with Thomas Pynchon, David Shetzline, and Peter Yarrow while at Cornell. He was suspended for alleged participation in a student demonstration against campus regulations, and although he later resumed his status as a student, he dropped out in 1959, just before graduation.
Ascent on Greenwich Village folk scene
On returning to Manhattan, Fariña became a regular patron of the White Horse Tavern, the well-known Greenwich Village tavern frequented by poets, artists, and folksingers, where he befriended Tommy Makem. It was there that he met Carolyn Hester, a successful folk singer. They married 18 days later. Fariña appointed himself Hester's agent; they toured worldwide while Fariña worked on his novel and Carolyn performed gigs. Fariña was present when Hester recorded her third album at Columbia studios during September 1961, where a then-little-known Bob Dylan played the harmonica on several tracks. Fariña became a good friend of Dylan; their friendship is a major topic of David Hajdu's book, Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fariña, and Richard Fariña.
Fariña then travelled to Europe, where he met Mimi Baez, the teenage sister of Joan Baez, in the spring of 1962. Hester divorced Fariña soon thereafter, and Fariña married 17-year-old Mimi in April 1963. Thomas Pynchon was the best man. They moved to a small cabin in Carmel, California, where they composed songs with a guitar and Appalachian dulcimer. They debuted their act as "Richard & Mimi Fariña" at the Big Sur Folk Festival in 1964 and signed a contract with Vanguard Records. They recorded their first album, Celebrations for a Grey Day (released under the name Mimi & Richard Fariña), in 1965, with the help of Bruce Langhorne, who had previously played for Dylan. During the brief life of Richard Fariña, the couple released only one other album, Reflections in a Crystal Wind, also in 1965. A third album, Memories, was issued in 1968, after his death.
Fariña, like Dylan and others of this time, was considered a protest singer, and several of his songs are overtly political. Several critics have considered Fariña to be a major folk music talent of the 1960s. ("If Richard had survived that motorcycle accident, he would have easily given Dylan a run for his money." – Ed Ward).
His best-known songs are "Pack Up Your Sorrows" and "Birmingham Sunday", the latter of which was recorded by Joan Baez and became better known after it became the theme song for Spike Lee's film 4 Little Girls, a documentary about the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. "Birmingham Sunday" was also recorded by Rhiannon Giddens in 2017, on her album Freedom Highway. He also wrote "The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood", which was recorded by Sandy Denny.
At the time of his death, Fariña was producing an album for his sister-in-law Joan Baez. She ultimately decided not to release the album. Two of the songs were included on Fariña's posthumous album, and another, a cover version of Fariña's "Pack Up Your Sorrows", co-written by Fariña with the third Baez sister, Pauline Marden, was released as a single in 1966; it has been included in a number of Baez' compilation albums.
Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me
Fariña is known for his novel Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, originally published by Random House in 1966. The title comes from the Furry Lewis song "I Will Turn Your Money Green" ("I have been down so long/It seems like up to me"). The novel, based largely on his college experiences and travels, is a picaresque novel, set in 1958 in the American West, in Cuba during the Cuban Revolution, and mostly at Cornell University (called Mentor University in the novel). The protagonist is Gnossos Pappadopoulis, who enjoys dope, paregoric, feta cheese, Red Cap ale and retsina; attacks authority figures with anarchic glee; and lusts after the girl in the green knee-socks while searching for the right karma. The book has become a cult classic among fans of the 1960s and counterculture literature. Thomas Pynchon, who later dedicated his book Gravity's Rainbow (1973) to Fariña, described Fariña's novel as "coming on like the Hallelujah Chorus done by 200 kazoo players with perfect pitch... hilarious, chilling, sexy, profound, maniacal, beautiful, and outrageous all at the same time."
Death
On April 30, 1966, two days after the publication of his novel, Fariña attended a book-signing ceremony at a Carmel Valley Village bookstore, the Thunderbird. Later that day, while at a party to celebrate his wife Mimi Fariña's twenty-first birthday, Fariña saw a guest with a motorcycle, who later gave Fariña a ride up Carmel Valley Road, heading east toward the rural Cachagua area of Carmel Valley.
At an S-turn the driver lost control. The motorcycle tipped over on the right side of the road, came back to the other side, and tore through a barbed wire fence into a field where a small vineyard now exists. The driver survived, but Fariña was killed instantly. According to Pynchon's preface to Been Down..., the police said the motorcycle must have been traveling at , even though "a prudent speed" would have been .
Fariña is buried in a simple grave, its marker emblazoned with a peace sign, at Monterey City Cemetery in Monterey, California.
Legacy
On April 27, 1968, Fairport Convention recorded a live version of "Reno Nevada" for French TV programme Bouton Rouge, featuring vocals by Judy Dyble and Iain Matthews. They recorded the song for a BBC session later in the same year, this time with Dyble's replacement in the band Sandy Denny, subsequently included on the album Heyday. Denny also recorded "The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood" for her 1972 album Sandy. Matthews later recorded "Reno Nevada" and "Morgan the Pirate" for his album "If You Saw Thro' My Eyes" as well as "House of Un-American Blues Activity Dream" for his album Tigers Will Survive, and other Fariña compositions appeared on subsequent Matthews solo albums and on recordings by Matthews' band Plainsong.
South Carolina-based rock band A Fragile Tomorrow covered a version of Mimi and Richard's song "One Way Ticket" on their 2015 release Make Me Over. Their version is a collaboration with Joan Baez and Indigo Girls. Brothers Dom Kelly, Sean Kelly, and Brendan Kelly of A Fragile Tomorrow are third cousins of Richard and had wanted to cover his music with Baez.
Joan Baez's song "Sweet Sir Galahad" commemorates Fariña's death, the grieving of his widow Mimi, and Mimi's eventual recovery and remarriage.
Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel Gravity's Rainbow is dedicated to Richard Fariña.
Richard Barone's 2016 album Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s contains Barone's interpretation of Fariña's "Pack Up Your Sorrows" performed as a duet with Nellie McKay.
In Richard Linklater's movie Slacker, Fariña is described as a "young truth with balls," who could "think and fuck at the same time" (along with Richard Feynman, Italo Balbo, et al.), which is why "history buried him."

Nelson A. Boylen Collegiate Institute (Nelson A. Boylen CI, NABCI, Boylen CI, or Boylen); originally Nelson A. Boylen Secondary School was a Toronto District School Board secondary school facility located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada operated as a high school from 1966 to 2016. Opened by the former North York Board of Education in 1966, the school was part of the Toronto District School Board as a very small school, yet the student body is known to be one of the most multicultural in Toronto, with students representing countries from all around the world. The school ceased to exist as an operating school on June 30, 2016 and as of , the school building remains vacant. The motto was "Veritas et Virtus" (Truth and virtue).
History
Although building the school began in late 1964, it wasn't ready for students until 1966. Students were accommodated on an afternoon "shift" at Queensborough Junior High. It wasn't until early 1966 that Nelson A. Boylen Secondary School opened its doors to welcome its first students. It later became a Collegiate. It was designed as a 2-story "H" model (with "Sesame Street" forming the crossbar of the "H") and almost from the outset needed portables to accommodate the student body. The school was named after Nelson A. Boylen, who served as North York Township Deputy Reeve for Ward 3 from 1941 to 1945 and from 1947 to 1949. He served as the township's 7th Reeve from 1950 to 1952 and served as Councillor for Ward 3 from 1954 to 1955.
In its prime years Nelson A. Boylen was a vibrant high school with a well-rounded student community focussed on academic, artistic and athletic achievement.
In its later years, Nelson A. Boylen had a considerable percentage of students living with disabilities. As an effort to ensure the success of all students, the school had a Multiple Exceptionality program to help those that are struggling in school because of a mental and/or physical disabilities. Because the student body was so ethnically diverse, many students required English as a Second Language (ESL)/English Literacy Development (ELD) training to enhance classroom efficiency. The ESL/ELD program at Nelson A. Boylen was considered one of the strongest in the TDSB.
Decline and closure
By September 2013, the school had stopped accepting Grade 9 students due to lack of enrolment and the same for grade 10 in September 2014. Boylen had been experiencing an enrolment decline since 2009 and was expected to become a subject of the Pupil Accommodation Review along with Downsview Secondary School and Weston Collegiate Institute in late 2014/early 2015. The school now operates grades 11 and 12 only. However, some of the space was to be leased to the Toronto Catholic District School Board for three years due to overcrowding at St. Fidelis Catholic School which now occupies grades 6 to 8.
Without a massive pupil review, the Toronto District School Board decided that Boylen be closed by June 2015. The school was one of the 60 schools considered for closing after Liz Sandals pressured the board to review underutilized schools. The TCDSB, however, preferred to accommodate the entire St. Fidelis population by 2016 (This, however, did not materialize). The final reunion for the school was held in June 2015 organized by Brian Inkster
and the school closed its doors on June 30, 2016. The school's final principal was Ian Bootnick.
As a TCDSB school facility
Since 2019, the Boylen property became part of the Toronto Catholic District School Board.
Overview
International studies
Nelson A. Boylen is one of very few TDSB secondary schools that offer the International Studies program. Since the student body represents countries from all around the world, school administrators felt that this type of program would represent the school well. The program attracts hopeful students from across the TDSB, and has a strong focus on business, science, and technology, three fields in which there are many job opportunities. Students who enrol are offered enriched opportunities such as participation in the I.S. Student Association, enriched co-curricular activities, international co-op/visits, and education travel. In order to successfully complete the program, students are required to take two to three I.S. credits per year, complete at least three modern language courses, participate in at least two enriched co-curricular activities yearly, and complete a minimum of 10 I.S. credits by graduation. Upon successful completion of the program, students will receive a special International Studies certificate, as well as the standard Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). It is the hope of Nelson A. Boylen Collegiate Institute and the International Studies program that all graduating I.S. students will be well-prepared for life in the 21st century.
Co-curricular activities
Nelson A. Boylen continuously encourages students to actively participate in school life. The school doesn't have many sports teams or clubs as can be found in the larger schools.

The Bari–Taranto railway is an Italian long railway line, that connects Bari with Gioia del Colle and Taranto.
The line was opened in two stages between 1865 and 1868. On 1 June 1865 the section from Bari to Gioia del Colle opened; the line was further extended on 15 September 1868 to Taranto.
Route upgrade
Work has been carried out to upgrade and double the line since 1994. The first section opened on 31 May 1994 between Acquaviva delle Fonti and Bitetto.
On 14 September 1997 the double track between Gioia del Colle and Palagianello opened. The line was rerouted which saw the closure of stations in Caratini, San Basilio and in Castellaneta town centre.
On 20 December 2004 the line was doubled between Acquaviva delle Fonti and Gioia del Colle, and on 27 May 2007 between Palagiano and Bellavista.
On 22 June 2008 the line was doubled between Grottalupara and Palagiano, which included a new alignment avoiding the centre of Palagianello and the opening of a new station.
On 31 May 2009 the line was doubled between Bari Centrale and Bari Sant'Andrea, which led to the closure of Bari Policlinico station. The southern section of the line was also doubled in 2010.
The final section, between Modugno and Bitetto will be realigned and doubled in 2014.

The Division of Water Resources within the Kansas Department of Agriculture governs the use and allocation of the state's water resources; regulates the construction of dams, levees and other changes to streams; represents Kansas on its four interstate river compacts; and coordinates the National Flood Insurance Program in Kansas. These responsibilities are accomplished through the administration of 30 state laws, including the Kansas Water Appropriation Act, Groundwater Management District Act, Obstructions in Streams, and the Levee Law.
The Division of Water Resources is one of several state agencies managing the state's water resources. Its role is principally regulatory. Other agencies and their roles associated with water include the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (water quality regulation); Kansas Water Office (water planning and policy); and the Division of Conservation (soil and water conservation projects).
The chief engineer leads the Division of Water Resources. David Barfield has served as chief engineer since 2007, being the fifth chief engineer since the Division's inception. The Division of Water Resources is organized around three programs: Water Appropriation, Water Structures, and Water Management Services. The Division of Water Resources is headquartered in Manhattan, Kansas, with field office locations in Topeka, Stafford, Stockton, and Garden City.
History
1927-1951
The Division of Water Resources was created in 1927, which effectively consolidated the Kansas Water Commission of 1917 and the Division of Irrigation of 1919. George S. Knapp, who had been appointed state irrigation commissioner, became the first chief engineer in 1927. Under his 32 years of service, various laws were enacted, including the Levee Law (1929), Obstructions in Streams (1929), Water Storage Law (1941), and the Kansas Water Appropriation Act (1945). Also signed at this time were the Republican River Compact (1943) and the Arkansas River Compact (1949).
1951-1972
In 1951, Robert V. Smrha became the second chief engineer and served for 21 years. Under his administration there were major amendments to the Kansas Water Appropriation Act in 1957 that addressed water right changes and filing requirements. In addition, the Kansas-Oklahoma Arkansas River Compact (1966) and the Big Blue River Compact (1971) were signed. In 1972 the Groundwater Management District Act was enacted.
1972-1983
Guy E. Gibson was the third chief engineer, who served from 1972 to 1983. Under Gibson, Groundwater Management District Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were formed in Kansas from 1973 to 1976. Major amendments to the Groundwater Management District Act occurred in 1978, which added a process to allow for the creation of intensive groundwater use control areas. This addition to the statutes provided the chief engineer authority to implement more comprehensive corrective control provisions for water supply protection when local conditions require it or by the request of local stakeholders. Intensive groundwater use control areas were designated in McPherson in 1980 and the Pawnee River Valley in 1981. In addition, the enactment of the Water Plan Storage Act (1974) and the Water Transfer Act (1983) occurred under Gibson's administration.
1983-2007
In 1983, David L. Pope became the fourth chief engineer and served for 24 years. Over his tenure, extensive rules and regulations were developed and adopted under the Kansas Water Appropriation Act, Obstructions in Steams, and the Levee Law. He also designated additional intensive groundwater use control areas in Burrton (1984), Lower Smoky Hill River Valley (1984), Hays (1985), Arkansas River Valley (1986), Upper Smoky Hill River Valley (1988), and Walnut Creek (1992). In addition, Kansas v. Colorado was filed in 1985 to enforce terms of the Arkansas River Compact. In 1998 Kansas v. Nebraska and Colorado also filed to enforce terms of the Republican River Compact. The Final Settlement Stipulation of the Republican River Compact occurred in 2003. For the Arkansas River Compact violations, damages exceeding $35 million were paid to Kansas in 2005-2006. Other milestones under Pope's administration included the enactment of the Water Assurance Program Act (1986), Floodplain Zoning Ordinances Act (1991), and the Water Banking Act (2001).
2007-Current
The present chief engineer, David Barfield has initiated the enforcement of the Republican River Compact Settlement in 2007 and concluded the Kansas v. Colorado litigation enforcing the Arkansas River Compact in 2009 in favor of Kansas. Barfield has worked to increase the development of groundwater modeling to analyze hydrologic conditions and for use as a tool to support decisions in water resource management. Barfield has ongoing dialogues with the Groundwater Management Districts and stakeholders regarding options to address areas with over appropriation of water resources, many of which are located in the Ogallala aquifer.
Programs
Water Appropriation – Administers the Kansas Water Appropriation Act and rules and regulations pertaining to the management of water resources. This program issues permits to appropriate water, changes to existing water rights, regulates water use, and maintains records of all water rights in the state.
Water Structures – Regulates, stream modifications, levees and floodplain fills for the protection of life, property and public safety; also provides technical assistance and coordination to local communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Water Management Services – Provides technical service and data management and support to agency water programs. Consists of the following sub-programs:
Interstate Water Issues – Assists the chief engineer in his responsibilities related to ensure Kansas fulfills its obligations and receives the full benefits under Kansas four interstate water compacts: the Kansas-Colorado Arkansas River, Big Blue River, Kansas-Oklahoma Arkansas, and the Republican River.
Basin Management Team – Addresses water resource issues identified in the Kansas State Water Plan by developing water management strategies. Basin Management Team staff is involved in groundwater modeling, data analysis and report writing activities for project areas in Kansas.

Alexander L. Kielland was a Norwegian semi-submersible drilling rig that, on 27 March 1980, capsized in the Ekofisk oil field in the North Sea, killing 123 people. To capsize was the worst disaster in Norwegian waters since the Second World War. The rig, located approximately 320 km east of Dundee, Scotland, was owned by the Stavanger Drilling Company of Norway and was on hire to the U.S. company Phillips Petroleum at the time of the disaster. The rig was named after the Norwegian writer Alexander Lange Kielland.
The rig was built as a mobile drilling unit at a French shipyard, and delivered to Stavanger Drilling in July 1976. The floating drill rig was not used for drilling purposes but served as a semi-submersible 'flotel' providing living quarters for offshore workers. By 1978 additional accommodation blocks had been added to the platform, so that up to 386 persons could be accommodated. In 1980, the platform was providing offshore accommodation for the production platform Edda 2/7C. Within a few days it was scheduled to start a new contract with Shell UK as a drilling rig.
Accident
Early in the evening of 27 March 1980, more than 200 men were off duty in the accommodation on Alexander L. Kielland. Conditions were rainy with dense fog, with the wind gusting to and waves up to high. Kielland had just been winched away from the Edda production platform.
Minutes before 18:30, those on board felt a 'sharp crack' followed by 'some kind of trembling'. Suddenly Keilland heeled over 30° and then stabilised. Five of the six anchor cables had broken, the one remaining cable preventing the rig from capsizing. The list continued to increase and at 18:53, the remaining anchor cable snapped and the rig capsized.
130 men were in the mess hall and the cinema when the capsizing occurred. Keilland had seven 50-man lifeboats and twenty 20-man rafts. Four lifeboats were launched, but only one managed to release from the lowering cables. (A safety device did not allow release until the strain was removed from the cables). A fifth lifeboat came adrift and surfaced upside down; its occupants righted it and gathered nineteen men from the water. Two of Kiellands rafts were detached and three men were rescued from them. Two 12-man rafts were thrown from Edda and rescued thirteen survivors. Seven men were taken from the sea by supply boats and seven swam to Edda.
No one was rescued by the standby vessel Silver Pit, which took an hour to reach the scene. Of the 212 people aboard the rig, 123 had been killed, making it the worst disaster in Norwegian offshore history since the Second World War and the deadliest offshore rig disaster of all time up to that point. Most of the workers were from Rogaland.
At around 21:30 hrs. a vessel from the Dutch company Smitlloyd came on location. The crew of this vessel heard people shouting for help. Maneuvering with great caution the Smitlloyd vessel encountered a life raft from the rig and after checking this raft it was found empty. It was very difficult to get this life raft on deck so the crew let the raft go. 2 more liferafts were found by the Smitlloyd vessel and they also were found empty. The crew heard still people shouting for help but due to the dense fog nobody was seen. The Smitlloyd vessel stayed on location for several days helping the coordinated rescue operation.
Investigation
In March 1981, an investigative report concluded that Keilland collapsed due to a fatigue crack in one of its six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg to the rest of the rig. This was traced to a small 6mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength.
Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of lamellar tearing in the flange plate and cold cracks in the underlying groove weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea) seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse. Judging by paint on part of the fractured surface, the crack was probably due to improper work during the rig's construction in 1976. Other major structural elements then failed in sequence, destabilising the entire structure. The design of the rig was flawed owing to the absence of structural redundancy.
Keilland was recovered in 1983 at the third attempt. The rig was scuttled later that year in the Nedstrand Fjord after a search for missing bodies had been completed, as well as several tests to determine the cause of the disaster.
Consequences
In response to the Kielland disaster, North Sea offshore installations tightened their command organization, identifying a clear authority who would order abandonment in case of emergency. The fourteen minutes between initial failure of the leg and the rig's eventual capsize left a window in which most of the personnel on board could have escaped, had a more effective command structure been in place. These revised command structures, similar to conventional shipping command structures, are now frequently put into use when vessels lose anchorage in storm conditions or when fixed installations are threatened by out-of-control vessels.
The failure to deploy lifeboats led to new legislation regarding on-load release hooks for lifeboats on oil rigs. As a consequence, the International Maritime Organization issued a requirement for all lifeboats on merchant ships to be fitted with hooks that could be released even when they were under load.
A memorial to the disaster was erected in 1986 on the coast of Kvernevik. Named "Broken Chain" (), the memorial depicts a broken chain link. It weighs about and stands high.
Similar incidents
Not long after Kielland capsized, her sister rig, Henrik Ibsen, suffered a jammed ballast valve, causing her to list twenty degrees, but was later righted again. Approximately eighteen months later, Ocean Ranger capsized in similar weather conditions off the Newfoundland coast. An investigation into the cause of the Ocean Ranger disaster by the United States Coast Guard established that structural failure was not a factor.

The Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) is a New World warbler, that breeds in eastern North America and winters in the West Indies and Central America. Plain brown above, it is white below, with black streaks and with buff flanks and undertail, distinguishing it from the closely related northern waterthrush. The habitats it prefers are streams and their surroundings, and other wet areas.
Range
It breeds in eastern North America from southernmost Canada and south through the eastern United States, excluding Florida and the coast. The Louisiana waterthrush is migratory, wintering in Central America and the West Indies. This is a rare vagrant to the western United States. They are one of the earlier neotropical migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring, often completing their migration in late March or early April, which is almost two months before most other warblers reach their breeding grounds. They are also one of the earliest warblers to vacate their breeding grounds, with some departing as early as July; almost all will have left by late August.
Description
The Louisiana waterthrush has a plain brown back and white underparts streaked with black. The flanks and undertail are buff. There is a strong white flared supercilium, and the legs are bright pink. All plumages are similar, but young birds have buff underparts rather than white. The main confusion species is the closely related northern waterthrush (Parkesia noveboracensis), which has white flanks and undertail, a striped throat, a slightly smaller bill, a shorter supercilium and duller pink legs.
In a study of the two waterthrushes in Connecticut nesting grounds, the Louisiana waterthrush, at an average of , was rather larger than the Northern, at an average of . The Louisiana waterthrush is the largest species of wood warbler. It measures in length and spanning across the wings. The weight of adult birds can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail , the bill is and the tarsus is .
The male's song is a musical, distinctive series of descending notes followed by a warble. The pitch of the beginning notes of the Louisiana's song usually descend, just as does the hilly stream that is its preferred habitat, whereas in the northern waterthrush the song does not vary in pitch as much. The call is a hard chink.
Like the closely related northern waterthrush, the Louisiana waterthrush frequently bobs its tail.
Ecology
The male Louisiana waterthrush does not sing on its wintering grounds before it leaves. It sings immediately when it arrives on its breeding territory. Whether it begins singing during migration is not known. When establishing his territory, a male sings vigorously nearly all day. After he acquires a mate, singing decreases quickly and he concentrates his singing into the morning hours. The breeding habitat is wet woodlands near running water and does not occur outside such areas as a breeder. However, during winter, the Louisiana waterthrush mainly forages along flooded roads or trails, and in parks, lawns and gardens, rarely entering true forest, even forested wetlands, in the subtropics. The northern waterthrush prefers stagnant, swampy waters and is generally a more terrestrial forager. Louisiana waterthrushes prefer dense vegetation along the water's edge for nesting, since this provides the main protection of nest from predation. Louisiana waterthrushes nest in a rock crevice, mud bank or amongst tree roots, laying 4–6 eggs in a cup nest from late May to mid-June. Both parents construct the nest, which is built from wet, muddy leaves, pine needles, grass, and small twigs. The female Louisiana waterthrush incubates the eggs for 12 or 13 days. The fledging period lasts for 9 or 10 days, with both adults feeding the young for a further 4 weeks.
They are one of a few passerine species that does most of its foraging in actively running water, which only the dippers are known for at the family level. Mostly they depend on aquatic insects, molluscs, and crustaceans. Occasionally ground-based insects, such as beetles and ants are taken, as well as flying insects, such as flies, which may be hawked on the wing. Alternately, they forage amongst the leaf litter. In circumstances where the insect prey is low, Louisiana waterthrushes can target prey as large as salamanders and small fish.
Status
Less common and widespread today than it was two centuries ago, the Louisiana waterthrush's decline is mainly due to the reduction of suitable habitat, through clearing and channelization of streams, as well as pollution, and the impounding of rivers and streams to create reservoirs. Additionally, because the Louisiana waterthrush is dependent on large areas of continuous forest, this species is likely to be threatened by increasing forest fragmentation. Timber harvesting, agriculture, urban development and gas drilling may further reduce the available habitat for this species. The population seems be quite sensitive to changes in habitat quality and quantity. Threats to the Canadian population of this species include reduced insect prey and reductions in water supply due to agricultural drainage, excessive irrigation and climate change, as well as logging and habitat fragmentation.

The 2020 United States presidential election in Wyoming was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election in which all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated. Wyoming voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump and running mate Vice President Mike Pence, against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris. Wyoming has three electoral votes in the Electoral College. Trump, the Republican nominee and incumbent president of the United States, won the state's three electoral votes.
Trump routed Biden in Wyoming, with his 69.94% vote share there making it his strongest win in the election. He won the sparsely populated state by a margin of 43.39%, down from his 45.77% four years earlier. Prior to the election, all news organizations declared Wyoming a safe red state, therefore justifying its status as one of the safest red states in the country, not being won by a Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide victory. Trump's 69.94% of the vote is the second-highest ever by a presidential candidate in Wyoming, only surpassed by Ronald Reagan during his 1984 landslide.
Despite his loss, Biden scored a landslide win in Teton County, garnering a larger vote share in it than any nominee since 1984. He also narrowly flipped the bellwether of Albany County, anchored by the college town of Laramie, which had supported Obama in 2008 before returning to the Republican Party in 2012 and 2016, albeit by a narrow margin. Per exit polls by the Associated Press, Trump's strength in Wyoming came from whites, who comprised 89% of the electorate, and from voters prioritizing energy policy, with 62% believing the government should focus on expanding production of fossil fuels such as oil, gas, or coal.
Caucuses
Democratic caucuses
The Democratic caucuses were originally scheduled for April 4, 2020. On March 22, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wyoming Democratic Party canceled in-person voting in favor of mail-in voting. The deadline was also extended to April 17.
Republican caucuses
The Republican state party convention was held in May to officially select the final delegates to the national convention.

Fundamental modeling concepts (FMC) provide a framework to describe software-intensive systems. It strongly emphasizes the communication about software-intensive systems by using a semi-formal graphical notation that can easily be understood.
Introduction
FMC distinguishes three perspectives to look at a software system:
Structure of the system
Processes in the system
Value domains of the system
FMC defines a dedicated diagram type for each perspective. FMC diagrams use a simple and lean notation. The purpose of FMC diagrams is to facilitate the communication about a software system, not only between technical experts but also between technical experts and business or domain experts. The comprehensibility of FMC diagrams has made them famous among its supporters.
The common approach when working with FMC is to start with a high-level diagram of the compositional structure of a system. This “big picture” diagram serves as a reference in the communication with all involved stakeholders of the project. Later on, the high-level diagram is iteratively refined to model technical details of the system. Complementary diagrams for processes observed in the system or value domains found in the system are introduced as needed.
Diagram Types
FMC uses three diagram types to model different aspects of a system:
Compositional Structure Diagram depicts the static structure of a system. This diagram type is also known as FMC Block Diagram
Dynamic Structure Diagram depicts processes that can be observed in a system. This diagram type is also known as FMC Petri-net
Value Range Structure Diagram depicts structures of values found in the system. This diagram type is also known as FMC E/R Diagram
All FMC diagrams are bipartite graphs. Each bipartite graph consists of two disjoint sets of vertices with the condition that no vertex is connected to another vertex of the same set. In FMC diagrams, members of one set are represented by angular shapes, and members of the other set are represented by curved shapes. Each element in an FMC diagram can be refined by another diagram of the same type, provided that the combined graph is also bipartite. This mechanism allows modeling all relevant layers of abstraction with the same notation.
Compositional Structure Diagram
Compositional structure diagrams depict the static structure of a system, and the relationships between system components. System components can be active or passive. Agents are active system components. They perform activities in the system. Storages and channels are passive components which store or transmit information.
The image to the right is an example of a compositional structure diagram. It contains the agents Order Processor, Supplier Manager, Supplier, Online Shop and an unnamed human agent. Agents are represented by rectangles. The dots and the shadow of the agent Supplier indicate that this agent has multiple instances, i.e. the Supplier Manager communicates with one or many suppliers. The so-called human agent represents a user interacting with the system.
The diagram contains the storages Orders, Purchase Order and Product Catalog. Storages are represented by curved shapes. Agents can read from storages, write to storages or modify the content of storages. The directions of the arrows indicate which operation is performed by an agent. In the diagram, the Supplier Manager can modify the content of the Product Catalog, whereas the Order Processor can only read the content of the Product Catalog.
Agents communicate via channels. The direction of information flow is either indicated by arrows (not shown in the picture), by a request-response-symbol (e.g. between Supplier Manager and Supplier) or omitted (e.g. between Order Processor and Supplier Manager).
Dynamic Structure Diagram
Dynamic structures are derived from petri nets.
"They are used to expressing system behavior over time, depicting the actions performed by the agents. So they clarify how a system is working and how communication takes place between different agents."
Value Range Structure Diagram
Value range structure diagrams (also known as FMC Entity Relationship Diagrams) can be compared with the Entity-relationship model.
"[They] are used to depict value range structures or topics as mathematical structures. Value range structures describe observable values at locations within the system whereas topic diagrams allow a much wider usage in order to cover all correlations between interesting points."

The California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) regulates amateur and professional boxing, amateur and professional kickboxing and professional mixed martial arts (MMA) throughout the State by licensing all participants and supervising the events.
In May 2017, CSAC implemented a 10-point plan against extreme weight-cutting inclusive of fine fighters who missed contracted fight weights, missed weight fighters may ask to move to higher weight class, a 30-day and 10-day weight check for “high level title fights among others On October 25, 2019 CSAC passed a vote of 5–0 on cancelling a fight if fighters weighted more than 15% above their contracted fight weight on the day of the event.

Barry Gray (born John Livesey Eccles; 18 July 1908 – 26 April 1984) was a British musician and composer best known for his collaborations with television and film producer Gerry Anderson.
Life and career
Born into a musical family in Blackburn, Lancashire, Gray was encouraged to pursue a musical career from an early age. Starting at the age of five – with piano lessons – he studied diligently and became a student at the Manchester Royal College of Music and at Blackburn Cathedral. He studied composition under the Hungarian born émigré composer Matyas Seiber. Gray's first professional job was for B. Feldman & Co. in London, where he gained experience in scoring for theatre and variety orchestras. From there, he joined Radio Normandy as a composer-arranger. After serving for six years with the Royal Air Force during World War II he returned to the music industry to work with such names as Vera Lynn and Hoagy Carmichael.
In 1956 Gray joined Gerry Anderson's AP Films and scored its first marionette puppet television series, The Adventures of Twizzle. This was followed by Torchy The Battery Boy and Four Feather Falls, a puppet Western based on a concept suggested by Gray. His association with Anderson lasted throughout the 1960s. Although best known for his score to Thunderbirds (in particular the "March of the Thunderbirds" title music), Gray's work also included the themes to all the other "Supermarionation" productions, including Fireball XL5, Stingray, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Joe 90. Recording sessions were held at Olympic Studios, Pye Studios and CTS Studios in London, Anvil Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire and Gray's own studios at his residence in Esher, Surrey.
Additionally, Gray is known as the composer for the Anderson live-action series of the 1970s, such as UFO and Space: 1999 (though he was not involved in scoring The Protectors). His work in cinema included the scores to the Thunderbirds feature films Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968), and the live-action science-fiction drama Doppelgänger (1969). Gray's professional association with Anderson and his career in TV and film scoring ended when he decided to leave the production of Space: 1999 after the completion of the first series. His replacement for the second series was Derek Wadsworth, who composed new title music.
In 1970, Gray moved from Esher to St Peter Port, Guernsey. Later, after his retirement, he served as resident pianist at the Old Government House Hotel. Gray died in hospital on Guernsey on 26 April 1984. He had a son, Simon.
Composing style
Gray's music is characterised by the use of brass and percussion sections. It made extensive use of leitmotifs, with each machine in Thunderbirds having its own theme and the eponymous title character of Joe 90 being accompanied on-screen by a wordless representation of his name. The ensembles required for Gray's scoring in series such as Thunderbirds and Stingray dwarfed those used in the production of most contemporary television programmes; even the orchestra employed for the first Anderson-produced series to carry the "Supermarionation" label, Supercar, comprised some forty instrumentalists. A standout example is Stingray: March of the Oysters (1964), which was later recorded by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Nic Raine.
Besides composing and conducting orchestral scores for television and film, Gray developed an interest in the Ondes Martenot, which he used to produce unconventional musical notes as well as electronic sound effects in several of his scores, including those for Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Doppelgänger (1969). Gray's knowledge and recognition in the field resulted in commissions to provide electronic music and sound effects for such films as Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965), Island of Terror (1966), and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), and uncredited work on Fahrenheit 451 (1966).
Gray believed that the score for the live action Doppelgänger was his best. It was recorded in three studio sessions between 27 and 29 March 1969. The first of these sessions used a 55-member orchestra, the second 44 and the third 28. The scenes of Ross and Kane's journey to the Counter-Earth are accompanied by a piece titled "Sleeping Astronauts" featuring the Ondes Martenot, played by French ondiste Sylvette Allart. Archer and Hearn describe this piece as "one of the most enchanting" ever written by Gray, adding that the soundtrack as a whole evokes a "traditional Hollywood feel" in contrast with the film's future setting.
Fanderson, the official appreciation society dedicated to the productions of Gerry Anderson, has gained access to all Gray's original studio tapes and undertaken a major re-issue project, compiling the theme and incidental music from Gray's various collaborations with Anderson onto a series of re-mastered CDs. Silva Screen Records has released several single-disc versions of the tv series soundtracks (Supercar, Fireball XL5, Thunderbirds) and feature film Thunderbirds are Go Unlike the Fanderson releases (members-only) the Silva Screen discs are available to the general public.
Centenary concert
On the evening of 8 November 2008, to mark the centenary year of Gray's birth, a concert was held in the Royal Festival Hall at London's South Bank Centre. Ralph Titterton, restorer of the Gray archive and co-producer of the original soundtrack CDs, and Cathy Ford, a librarian, researcher and biographer, joined film composer, conductor and arranger François Evans to produce the event in aid of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.

Louis Klein Diamond (; May 11, 1902 – June 14, 1999) was an American pediatrician, known as the "father of pediatric hematology."
Early life and career
Diamond was born in Chişinău, Bessarabia Governorate
as the son of Jewish parents, Eliezer Dimant and Lena Klein.
His family emigrated to the United States in 1904, following the Kishinev pogrom.
He began his medical studies at Harvard University in 1919 and, on graduating in 1923, entered Harvard Medical School, receiving his M.D. in 1927. Shortly after finishing medical school, Diamond studied briefly with Florence Sabin at the Rockefeller Institute before returning to New England, where he spent several years studying pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Kenneth Blackfan.
Diamond set up one of the first pediatric hematology research centers in the United States at Children's. Focusing on anemias, by 1930, he had succeeded in identifying thalassemia, a hereditary anemia that affected children of Italian and Greek ancestry. In 1932, along with Blackfan, he identified erythroblastosis fetalis, later called hemolytic disease of the newborn, at that time a significant disorder among newborns. In 1938, Diamond and Blackfan described 4 cases of infant erythroid hypoplastic anemia and which was to become known as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. He also discovered the blood diseases Gardner–Diamond syndrome, a painful bruising disorder, and Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects many different organs. He invented a Rhesus blood factor test with Neva Abelson (wife of physicist Philip Abelson).
Diamond died at his home in Los Angeles on June 14, 1999, at the age of 97. His son Jared Diamond is a popular science writer and Professor of Geography at UCLA.

Byzantine: The Betrayal is a video game, released September 30, 1997 for Microsoft Windows.
Gameplay
The game consists of a series of 360º screens ala Zork Nemesis, with live actors and photo realistic backgrounds. 16-bit models were designed to be placed into the backdrops for plot twists and puzzles. 45 minutes of live action footage was shot on location in Turkey.
Plot
The protagonist is an American journalist who travels to Turkey to chase an exclusive scoop, and ends up being caught up in a murder mystery. Your friend tells you to travel to the country, and when you arrive you are told by police that the friend isn't as innocent as you first thought, and that by proxy you are under suspicion of smuggling priceless artifacts out of the country. Their journey takes them to virtual reconstructions of historic locations such as Aya Sofya, Suleymaniye Mosque, and the Archaeological Museum.
Development
Byzantine was the first title in the planned Planet Explorer series by Discovery Channel. This series offered a range of cultural experiences from TV to gaming to online expeditions The tie-in television special to this game (by Enterprise Studios) was called Intrigue in Istanbul. The tie-in online expedition was called Selam: The Secret Language.
Serious Games and Edutainment Applications asserts that the flagship game in "cultural entertainment", Versailles 1685, paved the way for other historical video games such as this, as well as China: The Forbidden City, Egypt 1156 B.C.: Tomb of the Pharaoh, Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon, Rome: Caeser's Will, and Vikings.
According to Byzantine executive producer Harry Moxley, it took the team 16 months to produce the game, during which time they travelled throughout Turkey with the government's permission, and captured rolls of pictures and tapes of anything of interest from vehicles to museums to religious buildings. The team hired Turkish soap star actors to record lines for the game, despite many of them barely being able to speak English.
According to Byzantine artist Martin Servante, the project went through a crisis situation during the completion of one of the levels.
J.D. Sussman, vice president of Enterprise Studios, said: "the techniques and tools we've had to use to convert the Byzantine title from CD-ROM to DVD-ROM are all new. We have had to come up with custom solutions and this title has paved the way to develop solutions for other titles that follow."
Package design for the DVD was done by Zimmerman Crowe Design. The game was released in the United States in Oct, 1997. In Germany, the game was distributed by Egmont Interactive GmbH, was re-dubbed into German by voice recording company Tonsynchron, and was released in 1998. The game was also dubbed and subtitled into Castillian.
Reception
The game has a rating of 75.17% on GameRankings based on 6 reviews.
Skinny Minnie of Tap Repeatedly wrote that the soundscape consisted of ethnic Turkish-sounding strings and percussion. Just Adventure appreciated that the sex of the protagonist remains undefined. Adventure Classic Gaming felt that the game provided a satisfactory simulation of a tour through Byzantine (modern day Constantinople). Przygodoskop thought the game provided both an interesting and entertaining mystery. Game Revolution thought the narrative was engrossing yet convoluted at parts. Gamespot was impressed by the game's seamless blending of "Muslim and Christian religions" with "modern and conservative cultures". Metzomagic noted that the player is able to die throughout the game, so recommended the player keep autosave open.
Byzantine was a finalist for the Software Publishers Association's 1997 "Best Adventure/Role-Playing Software Game" Codie award, which ultimately went to Diablo. It was also nominated in the "Best Overall Multimedia Production" and "Best Use of Visual Arts in Multimedia" categories. Similarly, the Computer Game Developers Conference nominated Byzantine for its 1998 "Best Adventure/RPG" Spotlight Award, but this went ultimately to Final Fantasy VII.

Thomas Brown (9 January 17782 April 1820) was a Scottish philosopher and poet.
Biography
Early life
Brown was born at Kirkmabreck, Kirkcudbrightshire, the son of Rev. Samuel Brown (died 1779) (minister of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale) and Mary Smith.
Their son was a wide reader and an eager student. Educated at several schools in London, he went to the University of Edinburgh in 1792, where he attended Dugald Stewart's moral philosophy class, but does not appear to have completed his course. After studying law for a time he took up medicine; his graduation thesis De Somno was well received. But his strength lay in metaphysical analysis.
Career
Brown set an answer to the objections raised against the appointment of Sir John Leslie to the mathematical professorship (1805). Leslie, a follower of David Hume, was attacked by the clerical party as a sceptic and an infidel, and Brown took the opportunity to defend Hume's doctrine of causality as in no way inimical to religion. His defence, at first only a pamphlet, became in its third edition a lengthy treatise entitled Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect, and is a fine specimen of Brown's analytical faculty.
In 1806, Brown became a medical practitioner in partnership with James Gregory (1753–1821), but, though successful, preferred literature and philosophy. After twice failing to gain a professorship in the university, he was invited, during an illness of Dugald Stewart in the session of 1808–1809, to act as his substitute, and during the following session he undertook much of Stewart's work. The students received him with enthusiasm, due partly to his splendid rhetoric and partly to the novelty and ingenuity of his views. In 1810 he was appointed as colleague to Stewart, a position which he held for the rest of his life. Brown was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815. He wrote his lectures at high pressure, and devoted much time to the editing and publication of the numerous poems which he had written at various times during his life. He was also preparing an abstract of his lectures as a handbook for his class. His health, never strong, gave way under the strain of his work.
He was advised to take a trip to London, where he died in 1820 aged 42. His body was returned to Kirkmabreck for burial.
Criticism of Erasmus Darwin
One of Brown's notable works included a critique of Erasmus Darwin's theory of transmutation. The philosopher published it in the form of a detailed study Observations on the zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin (1798), which was recognized as a mature work of criticism.
There, Brown wrote:
Noteworthy, Brown's criticism of the Darwinian thesis, like that of Rudolf Virchow, did not come from any religious feeling. In fact, Brown's critique bears an uncanny resemblance to Thomas Robert Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) in which Malthus's main objection against Darwin's thesis, like that of Brown, was epistemological rather than religious.
Reception
Brown's philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later associational psychology, to which he really belonged. Later criticism of Brown's philosophy lessened its popularity, a severe attack being made by Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet in his Discussions and Lectures on Metaphysics. A high estimate of his merits was shown in John Stuart Mill's Examination of Hamilton. Also, in David Welsh's Account of the Life and Writings (1825) and James McCosh's Scottish Philosophy. Friedrich Eduard Beneke, who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines.
The philosopher Schopenhauer wrote of him in 1844:
Quite recently Thomas Brown has taught ... in his extremely tedious book Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect (4th ed., 1835), ... that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and instinctive conviction; he is therefore essentially on the right path. However, the crass ignorance is unpardonable by which, in this book of 476 pages, 130 of which are devoted to the refutation of Hume, no mention at all is made of Kant, who cleared up the matter seventy years ago.|The World as Will and Representation, Vol. II, Chapter IV
In his On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, § 20, Schopenhauer claimed that Brown intended to provide support for the Cosmological Proof of God's Existence. "… sometimes there is an intention…a theological design flirting with the Cosmological Proof…. We find the clearest instance of this in Thomas Browne's [sic] book, On the Relation of Cause and Effect…this Englishman rightly recognizes, that the causal law has invariably to do with changes, and that every effect is accordingly a change. Yet…he is unwilling to admit that every cause is likewise a change and that the whole process is therefore nothing but the uninterrupted connection of changes succeeding one another in time. On the contrary, he persists in clumsily calling the cause an object or substance, which precedes the change…in order that his definition may on no account stand in the way of the Cosmological Proof…."
His friend and biographer, David Welsh (1793–1845), superintended the publication of Brown's text-book, the Physiology of the Human Mind, and his Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind, which was published by his successors, John Stewart and Edward Milroy. The Lectures were well received both in England (where it reached a 19th edition) and in the USA.
Among Brown's poems, which were influenced by Alexander Pope and Akenside were: Paradise of Coquettes (1814); Wanderer in Norway (1815); Warfiend (1816); Bower of Spring (1817); Agnes (1818); Emily (1819); a collected edition in 4 vols. appeared in 1820. His poetry, though graceful, lacked force, and is now forgotten.
Brown was one of the first contributors to the Edinburgh Review. In its second number, he published a criticism of Immanuel Kant's philosophy, based on Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's account of it.

The Lingxiao Pagoda () is a Chinese pagoda west of the Xinglong Temple in Zhengding, Hebei Province, China.
History
The original pagoda that stood at the same site was dubbed the Wooden Pagoda, and was built in 860 AD during the Tang dynasty (618-907). The pagoda's present form of brick and wood dates to 1045 AD during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022–1063) of the Song dynasty (960-1279), and was renovated and restored in the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It was formerly part of the Tianning Monastery, and although the latter no longer exists, the pagoda has been well preserved since the 11th century. In 1966 the pagoda was damaged in an earthquake, but immediate repairs have kept it standing and open to the public.
Features
The brick base and structure of the 42 m (137 ft) tall pagoda ends after the 4th floor, as the rest of its height from the 5th floor up is purely wooden construction. It features a total of nine stories with nine wooden tiers of eaves encircling the octagonal frame of the pagoda. In the center of the pagoda stands a large column, a feature of Chinese architecture in pagodas that was discontinued sometime after the Song and Yuan periods. Built a decade later in 1055, the Liaodi Pagoda (China's tallest pre-modern pagoda) also features an inner column, in the shape of another pagoda. Within the interior of the Lingxiao Pagoda, a wooden staircase leads up to the 4th floor. The pagoda is also crowned with a cast iron spire. It is at the foot of this pagoda, that Dutch bishop Mgr. Frans Schraven (1873-1937) and his companions suffered their martyrdom in 1937, at the hands of the Japanese army, because of their refusal to hand over to the soldiers the Chinese women and girls whom had taken refuge in his compound.

Juraj Križanić (c. 1618 – 12 September 1683), also known as Jurij Križanič or Yuriy Krizhanich (), was a Croatian Catholic missionary who is often regarded as the earliest recorded pan-Slavist. His ideal, often misunderstood - even today - was to bring about a union of the churches, which Rome and Constantinople had tried to do without success for centuries. He believed that this might come about through closer relations between Slav Catholicism and the Russian Orthodox Church, and supported the idea that all Slavs had a common language and ethnic origin.
However, he was not a pan-Slav if this meant seeking the political unity of all Slav people under Russian leadership. He considered that the only possible role for the Tsar to 'correct' or unify the orthography and script used in Slav-language books and awaken Slav consciousness was through works conducive to education and logic. In extremis the South Slavs might join with the Russian tsar as a sovereign of the same language and people if the Catholic rulers supported his leadership in a war against the Ottomans.
After lengthy travels and fifteen years of exile in Siberia, Križanić died, misunderstood and disappointed, in battle during the Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683. Although he had no direct followers, Križanić's work influenced many later South Slav thinkers who championed both reliance on Russia and South Slav cultural and political unification.
Biography
Early life, education, and early missionary work
Križanić was born in Obrh, near Ozalj (in present-day Croatia) in 1618, a period of political turmoil and of Turkish invasions into Croatia. He attended a Jesuit grammar school in Ljubljana and a Jesuit gymnasium in Zagreb from 1629 to 1635. His father died when he was 17 years old, at approximately the same time he graduated from the gymnasium. He began attending the University of Bologna in 1638 to study theology and graduated in 1640. Shortly after graduating Križanić began attending the Greek College of St. Athanasius, a center in Rome for the training of Catholic missionaries who would work with Orthodox Christians, from which he graduated in 1642. By the end of his life he was proficient in ten languages. While Križanić had a strong desire to travel to Moscow with the ambitious goal of uniting the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, he was assigned missionary duties in Zagreb, where he was a teacher at the Zagreb Theological Seminary as well as a priest in several neighboring towns.
Life in Russia
Križanić managed to secure permission from the papacy for a brief visit to Moscow from 25 October to 19 December 1647. as part of a Polish embassy. However, he was not able to secure permission for a prolonged stay until 1658 (it was retracted shortly after being issued, a fact that Križanić simply ignored) and he did not arrive in Moscow until 17 September 1659. Another author said that he pretended to be an Orthodox Serb. He was assigned the duty of translating Latin and Greek documents and preparing an improved Slavic grammar. However, he was exiled to Siberia on 20 January 1661. The reason for his exile is still unknown. Possible explanations put forward have included the fact that he was a Roman Catholic priest, his criticism of Russian society and of the Greeks, with whom Patriarch Nikon was attempting reconciliation, and other political and social motives. Križanić postulated that he was exiled because of "some foolish thing" he had said to someone, and that whatever he had said had been mentioned to the authorities.
After his stay of roughly a year and a half in the Russian capital, Križanić arrived in Tobolsk in Siberia, on 8 March 1661. He lived there for 15 years, surviving on a state stipend and working on the treatises On Divine Providence, On Politics, and On Interpretation of Historic Prognostications amongst others. In these books, written in his self-devised "Common Slavonic language" (a Pan-Slavonic grammar named Grammatitchno Iskaziniye that incorporated numerous Slavic languages), he set forth a comprehensive program of reforms required for the Russian state, including reforms to administration, Russian serfdom, economic policy, education, grammar, and Russia's primitive agricultural system. Many of the reforms he recommended were in fact carried out by Peter the Great, although there is no concrete evidence of Križanić's direct influence in his doing so. His Politika, which he wrote from 1663-1666, was published by Peter Bezsonov (Russia in the Seventeenth Century, 1859–60) and for the first time in English in 1985 and is his most well known and influential work.
His appeal to the Czar to head the Slavs in the fight against the Germans shows a remarkable political foresight. Križanić was freed from exile on 5 March 1676. After that he remained in Moscow until 1678, when he travelled to Vilnius and later to Warsaw. He accompanied a Polish force on its way to liberate besieged Vienna from the Ottomans during the Battle of Vienna, where he died near Vienna while participating in its defence against the Turks in the Ukrainian troops that adjoined the troops of the Polish king Jan Sobiesky in 1683.
Ideas and theories
Križanić was one of the earliest proponents of Pan-Slavism. The language he created and used in his writing was called Ruski jezik ("Russian language"), but in reality it was a mixture of several Slavic languages and was devised to serve as a symbol of and even to promote Slavic unity. He wanted to unite the Slavic nations under the Russian Tsar and unite Catholic and Orthodox against the German Protestants and Turkish Muslims.
A key component of Križanić's theories concerning necessary reforms for the Russian state were his "Five Principles of Power." His five principles were: Full autocracy (essentially absolute monarchy), closed borders, compulsory labor or a ban on idleness, government monopoly of foreign trade, and ideological conformity. Križanić argued that Russia would be strengthened if immigration were tightly restricted and if native Russians were prohibited from leaving the country without justification. The autocrat should use his power to eliminate bad customs, modernize the country and give the nobles and clergy privileges on the model to the Western Ständestaat.
His works, which also include writings on music and economics, were re-discovered and printed in the mid-19th century.

The Strange Case of Rachel K is a 2015 short story collection by American author Rachel Kushner.
The book was released on March 24, 2015 through New Directions Publishing and it consists of three short stories which appeared previously in various literary journals. The two first stories, "The Great Exception" and "Debouchement" are early versions of parts of Rachel Kushner's debut novel Telex from Cuba (2008)
Title
In the short preface of the book, the author explains that The Strange Case of Rachel K is the name of a "Cuban film made in the early 1970's, during Cuba's great revolutionary renaissance" which recounts the story of a real person named Rachel K "a 1930's courtesan found murdered in a hotel room". Although Kushner has not seen the film, she uses this story as the basis of her own interpretation of the event.
Reception
The novel received generally positive reviews upon its release. A review for the Chicago Tribune points out that "those already sold on Kushner will be eager to read the raw materials of her debut novel" and that it shows "a compelling case for [Kushner's] prose". Another review for the Toronto Star says the stories show "a sense of how excitingly intense and weird Kushner can get" and that they give "a seeming prescience [of her later novels] that will only give her fans reason to love her more".

Coconut Island, or Moku o Loe, is a 28-acre (113,000 m²) island in Kāneʻohe Bay off the island of Oʻahu in the state of Hawaiʻi, United States. It is a marine research facility of the Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) of the University of Hawaiʻi.
History
In 1934–1936, Chris Holmes II, an heir to the Fleischmann yeast fortune, doubled the original island with coral rubble, sand, and earthen landfill. He established a residence with aquaria, kennels, and aviaries for his many pets. The island was converted to a rest and relaxation station for United States Navy flyers during World War II.
In 1946 a group of five Los Angeles businessmen, including Edwin W. Pauley, bought the island from the estate of Chris Holmes II with the idea of converting it to the exclusive Coconut Island Club International, 1946-7, and hired architects Paul Williams, A. Quincy Jones, and C.W. Lemmon of Belt Lemmon and Lo, Architects of Honolulu to design a community of cottages, tennis courts, a yacht club and other recreational facilities including remodeling the Holmes mansion and barracks. The Pauley group wanted to develop the island into a private, membership only resort. In 1949 this idea was dropped and a scaled-back Coconut Island Hotel with accommodation for 32 guests opened in February 1950.
In 1948, Pauley donated a portion of the island to the University of Hawaii to be used as a marine research facility. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the Pauley family used the island for summer get-aways and hosted many notable guests. From the mid-80s to mid-90s Japanese real estate investor Katsuhiro Kawaguchi owned the island and permitted the University of Hawaii to use some of its areas for research. In 1995, the Edwin Pauley Foundation granted a gift of $9.6 million to the University of Hawaii Foundation to purchase the private half of the island and build new laboratories on it.
The island is now completely owned by the state and is the facility for the Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology, part of the University of Hawaiʻi. It is the only U.S. laboratory built on a coral reef. (Heron Island, Lizard Island and a number of labs in the South Pacific are located outside of the U.S.)
Coconut Island was used for the opening sequence of the television program Gilligan's Island
Coconut island original name is Moku ‘o Lo'e which means island of Lo'e who was a lady that resided there in ancient times. .

He was then signed by the WWE in 2007 and sent to Florida Championship Wrestling under the new ring name Rycklon which was later changed to Ezekiel Jackson after his main-roster debut in 2008. During his time in WWE, Jackson was the final man to win the ECW Championship making him the third African-American to hold the championship, the sixth black world champion (after The Rock, Booker T, Bobby Lashley, Ron Simmons and Mark Henry) and the only South American-born world champion in WWE history, he later joined The Corre but was kicked out, thus starting a feud with the stable's leader Wade Barrett and he would go on to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Jackson would leave WWE in 2014 and briefly wrestle for TNA in the same year. He also competed in one season of Lucha Underground as Big Ryck from 2014-2015.

He is the owner of the Redwood City, California-based professional wrestling promotion and school Bryckhouse Pro Wrestling. In total, Jackson was a one-time world champion in professional wrestling.
Early life
Stephens attended the University at Buffalo.
Professional wrestling career
World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE
Florida Championship Wrestling (2007–2008)
Stephens signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment in March 2007 and debuted in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in late June. In his debut match on June 27, he teamed with Keith Walker to defeat Kofi Kingston and Eric Pérez. He continued to compete in the promotion in both tag team and singles matches. On February 8, 2008 he competed in a match with tag partner Bryan Kelly in a losing effort against Steve Lewington and Heath Miller in a mini-tournament to face the WWE Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz. On May 6, 2008, Stephens wrestled his final match in FCW before being called up to WWE's main roster.
The Brian Kendrick's bodyguard (2008–2009)
After being trained in FCW, Stephens debuted on the July 18, 2008 episode of SmackDown under the name Ezekiel, as The Brian Kendrick's bodyguard. On the August 8, 2008 edition of SmackDown, his ring name was tweaked to Ezekiel Jackson, and he was revealed as being Kendrick's "advisor". He then began interfering in Kendrick's matches against Jeff Hardy, Finlay, and WWE Champion Triple H. On the October 17 episode of SmackDown, Jackson made his official in-ring debut by quickly defeating Super Crazy, after replacing a supposedly sick Kendrick. In late 2008, Jackson began teaming with Kendrick and both began feuding with the WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), although Kendrick and Jackson failed to win the championship. He suffered his first defeat on the February 13, 2009 episode of SmackDown, when he lost a single match to R-Truth. Jackson made his final appearance on the SmackDown brand in a losing effort against Jeff Hardy on the April 3, 2009 episode.
The Ruthless Roundtable and ECW Champion (2009–2010)
On April 15, 2009, Jackson was drafted to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft, therefore breaking up the team of himself and Kendrick. He made his ECW debut defeating Jack Meridol on the July 9, 2009 episode. Jackson then began an angle with Vladimir Kozlov in which, week after week, after one of them had squashed a local competitor, the other would come out and hit their finishing move on the fallen opponent in a game of one-upmanship. On the August 18 episode of ECW, Jackson formed an alliance with Kozlov and William Regal after betraying the ECW Champion, Christian, during a tag team match to side with them, and attacking Christian at Regal's request. Kozlov and Jackson aided Regal in his feud with Christian over the ECW Championship, but Regal was unable to capture the title.
On the November 24 episode of ECW, Jackson attacked both Regal and Kozlov after Kozlov accused Jackson of costing Regal a match. The following week, Jackson once again betrayed Kozlov and Regal by walking out on Kozlov during a tag team match against Christian and Shelton Benjamin. Jackson, however, realigned himself with Regal, when he was aided by Regal in defeating Kozlov on an episode of ECW. On the January 12, 2010 episode of ECW, Jackson won the ECW Homecoming battle royal to earn a match for the ECW Championship. He faced Christian for the ECW championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view but was unsuccessful. On the final episode of ECW on February 16, Jackson defeated Christian to win the ECW Championship in an Extreme Rules match. Upon winning the title, WWE credits Jackson as the final ECW Champion.
The Corre and Intercontinental Champion (2010–2011)
On the February 19 episode of SmackDown, a video package aired, promoting Jackson's return to the brand. He made his return on the March 5 episode of SmackDown without Regal, who instead joined Raw, and defeated Jimmy Wang Yang. On April 10, 2010 at a house show in Glasgow, Scotland, Jackson suffered a tear in his right quadriceps muscle during a match against Kane, and was expected to be inactive for approximately six months. During his injury, Jackson was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft.
Jackson made his return to the ring on September 13, 2010, defeating Zack Ryder in a dark match prior to the Raw tapings. He returned to television on the October 18 episode of Raw, where he was revealed as a member of Team Raw for the Bragging Rights pay-per-view. At Bragging Rights, Jackson was one of the final two remaining members of Team Raw, but they lost to Team SmackDown. On the November 22 episode of Raw, Jackson qualified for the 2010 edition of the King of the Ring tournament by defeating Alex Riley, who replaced Jackson's original opponent The Miz. He faced Drew McIntyre in the quarter-finals, but the match ended in a double countout, so neither advanced.
In December 2010, Jackson was traded back to the SmackDown brand. On the January 11, 2011, taping of the January 14 edition of SmackDown, Jackson joined Wade Barrett, Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater in assaulting The Big Show, appearing to form an alliance with the three. The following week the group was named The Corre. On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Jackson defeated Big Show in a singles match, but refused to celebrate with the other members of The Corre afterward. Backstage, the other members of The Corre attacked him in retaliation, turning Jackson face.
Jackson went on to face Barrett for the Intercontinental Championship at Over the Limit, and won by disqualification, which meant that Barrett retained the championship. Jackson continued to feud with the other members of The Corre, winning against Barrett by disqualification and countout respectively.
On June 19, at the Capitol Punishment pay-per-view, Jackson defeated Barrett to win the Intercontinental Championship for the first time. Jackson successfully retained the championship in a rematch against Barrett on the following episode of SmackDown and also successfully defended it against Ted DiBiase on the July 15 episode. On August 12 episode of SmackDown, Jackson lost the Intercontinental Championship to Cody Rhodes, ending his Intercontinental Championship reign at 51 days. He went on to feud with both Rhodes and DiBiase. On the August 19 episode of SmackDown, he lost a rematch for the championship to Rhodes. Jackson was part of a ten-man battle royal for the Intercontinental Championship, but was eliminated by Rhodes.
Final feuds and departure (2012–2014)
On January 29, 2012 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Jackson entered the Royal Rumble match as the thirteenth entrant, but he was eliminated by the returning Great Khali. Jackson started a losing streak losing to the likes of Jinder Mahal, Drew McIntyre, and David Otunga. Jackson finally ended his losing streak by teaming with The Great Khali to defeat the team of Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks on the May 16 episode of NXT. However, he lost to the Big Show on the May 26 episode and May 27 episode of Smackdown.
Around mid–2012, Jackson suffered an upper body injury and was inactive for many months. After almost a year of inactivity due to his injury, Jackson returned at a live event for WrestleMania Axxess on April 4, 2013 by teaming up with Yoshi Tatsu to defeat the team of Hunico and Camacho. On January 4, 2014, Jackson announced he was undergoing another surgery. As a result of this, on April 6, 2014, Jackson reported that he had officially parted ways with the WWE.
Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2014)
He made his debut, along with Gene Snitsky, in TNA on the June 25 taping of Impact Wrestling (which aired on July 24) using the ringname Rycklon as a heel; attacking Tommy Dreamer, Bully Ray and Devon, and aligning himself with Dixie Carter. It also marked the very first time that the final champion of the original and the new ECW were in the ring at exactly the same time (Rhino and Rycklon) Rycklon and Snitsky were fired by Dixie Carter on the August 7 edition of Impact Wrestling. Earlier on the show they had competed in an Eight-Man Hardcore War between Team EC3 (EC3, Rhino, Rycklon and Snitsky) in a losing effort against Team Bully (Bully Ray, Devon, Tommy Dreamer and Al Snow).
Lucha Underground (2014–2015)
In September 2014, Stephens worked at Lucha Underground under the ring name Big Ryck, where he was forming a heel trio named The Crenshaw Crew with Cisco, Bael and Cortez Castro. Ryck feuded with Johnny Mundo and Prince Puma. Their feud concluded in a three-way ladder match, which was won by Mundo. On the October 5, 2014 taping, Ryck participated in an Aztec Warfare Battle Royal to crown the first Lucha Underground Champion but was eliminated. On January 21, 2015, Cisco, Castro and Bael attacked Ryck and burned his eye with a cigar, turning face in the process. Ryck returned to action on February 25, 2015, distracting The Crew in a match against Sexy Star, Mascarita Sagrada, and Pimpinela Escarlata. On March 4, 2015, Ryck defeated Star to earn a match against The Crew. Ryck defeated The Crew in a one-on-three handicap match. On February 8, 2015, Ryck, along with Killshot and Willie Mack participated in a tournament for the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, but they were defeated in the finals by the eventual winners Angélico, Son of Havoc and Ivelisse. After their loss, Ryck left Mack and Killshot and was hired by DelAvar Daivari, attacking Texano on May 20, 2015, turning heel in the process. At Ultima Lucha, Daivari ran out and distracted Ryck by firing him, hinting at a face turn. However, nothing came of this due to Stephens departing Lucha Underground in 2015 due to traveling conflicts. It was revealed that Big Ryck was one of five missing people on the April 20 episode of Lucha Underground. In the four issue mini series following that, it's explaining what had happened after Ultima Lucha and before season two. It was revealed that Ryck was "killed" by The Disciples of Death, officially writing his character off the show.
International promotions and retirement (2015)
On October 17, 2015, Stephens, as Big Ryck, made his debut for the German Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw) promotion, in what was also his last match. He unsuccessfully challenged Karsten Beck for the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship. Stephens retired from professional wrestling on October 18, 2015, and is now working as a trainer as of 2016.

Stephens has been married to his wife Jenn Stephens since 2004. Stephens is a devout Christian.

Jahid Afrail oglu Huseynli (), known professionally as JONY (born , in Baku, Azerbaijan) is a Russian singer and songwriter. The winner of the second season of the show «The Masked Singer» (2021) on the NTV channel.
Biography
Early period
Jahid was born on February 29, 1996, in Baku. By nationality - Azerbaijani. At the age of 4 he moved with his family to Moscow. At the age of 6 he went to the 1925th gymnasium in Novokosino. In the first grade, he began to sing in the school choir and impressed his teachers with his vocals. And already in the ninth grade, the future singer realized that he wanted to seriously connect his life with music.
However, Jony's father did not support his son's decision, as he wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a businessman. Therefore, after graduating from school, Jony entered State University of Management at the Faculty of International Business. True, according to the artist himself, he studied there without much enthusiasm.
After graduation of Master's degree Jony realized that he wanted to play music professionally and asked his father to give him a chance to try his hand at it.:«I was 22 years old when I asked my father to give me a chance to try my hand at something I love. Working for my father, who is the director of the company, is the easiest way, but he did not suit me and did not satisfy my ambitions.
I only added at the same time that if something doesn't work out for me, I will return and admit that I am a fool. But in the depths of my soul I knew that I could not come to my father with my head bowed and admit my defeat - what kind of man am I after that?".

As a child, Jahid really liked the cartoon «Johnny Bravo», so his mother jokingly began to call him Jony. Later, the singer began to introduce himself this way at school, when classmates could not remember his name.«I got used to the name "Jony", even my mother calls me that since I was three years old. Only my grandparents in Azerbaijan call me by my first name. But parents and friends - almost never. Most often "Jony", "Jo"».

John Young Stone (23 April 1843 – 26 June 1928) was an American politician.
John Young Stone was born near Springfield, Illinois, on 23 April 1843. He was one of three children of parents Mary Ellen McLemore and William Langford Stone. The Stone family moved to Silver Creek Township, Mills County, Iowa, after his mother's death in February 1856, following his grandfather, Spencer Stone, who had acquired land in the township three years previously. Stone served in the American Civil War with the Union Army from 1861. He was elevated to the rank of first lieutenant by the end of the conflict, after which he became a newspaper publisher. He was part-owner of the Glenwood Opinion alongside P. T. Ballard, and also edited the publication for two years, starting at the age of 22. Stone pursued a career in law as well, practicing alongside William Hale, with whom he had read law until passing the bar in 1868. From 1884, Stone began planting an apple orchard in Mills County. His land holdings later included a vineyard, and by 1892, numbered 800 acres, 100,000 trees and 75,000 grapevines. This venture ended after blight and a cold winter heavily affected yield.
Politically, Stone was affiliated with the Republican Party. He served two consecutive terms as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives from 1868 to 1872, two years each for District 16 and District 17. Stone was then elected to a single four-year term on the Iowa Senate for District 9. Between 1876 and 1880, Stone returned to the lower house of the state legislature, representing District 18 until 1878, when he assumed the District 20 seat. From 1876 to 1878, Stone was speaker of the house. Concurrently with his second stint as a state representative, Stone served as a member of the Republican National Committee. He was a delegate to two Republican National Conventions, in 1876 and 1884. Stone again held statewide office between 1889 and 1895, serving as Attorney General of Iowa. On 26 June 1928, Stone died in Glenwood, Iowa.

Tisamenus, the son of Antiochus, is mentioned in book 9 of The History by Herodotus. Tisamenus was a soothsayer for the Greek army during the Persian War. A Delphic oracle had foretold that he would win five great battles, and so the Spartans wished to hire him. Although he was from Elea, he and his brother were made citizens of Sparta as part of the deal. They were the only foreign men this privilege had ever been bestowed upon.

Microcotyle sebastisci is a species of monogenean, parasitic on the gills of marine fish. It belongs to the family Microcotylidae.
Systematics
Microcotyle sebastisci was first described by Yamaguti in 1958, from mature specimens only, out of 41 specimens recovered from three Sebastidae Sebastiscus marmoratus, Sebastodes güntheri (currently Sebastes ventricosus) and Sebastichthys pachycephalus (currently Sebastes pachycephalus) and one Serranidae Epinephelus akaara .
Unnithan erected the genus Caenomicrocotyle and the subgenus Caenomicrocotyle and transferred Microcotyle sebastisci as
Caenomicrocotyle (Caenomicrocotyle) sebastisci.
In 1972, Caballero y Caballero and Bravo-Hollis erected the genus Paramicrocotyle to describe Paramicrocotyle tampicensis and Paramicrocotyle atriobursata off Mexico and placed within this genus sixteen species previously assigned to the genus Microcotyle including Microcotyle sebastisci, as Paramicrocotyle sebastisci. Mamaev, in his revision of the family Microcotylidae, considered Paramicrocotyle a junior subjective synonym of Microcotyle.
Morphology
Microcotyle sebastisci has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a flattened, fusiform body with an anterior end forming a flat elevation beyond the anterior buccal suckers. The body comprises an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is wedge-shaped, and bears 29–62 clamps(11–31 clamps on each side), arranged as two rows. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two buccal suckersslightly smaller than the pharynx at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a globular pharynx, and a posterior intestine with two branches provided with irregular outer and inner branches; the right branch ends at the posterior end the body proper while the left one extends into the haptor. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include a reniform genital atrium, surrounded by radiating muscle fibers and covered inside with short spines except for the median anterodorsal areas, an oval to elliptical unarmed vagina opening middorsally at the anterior end, a single ovary in form of an interrogation mark, 8-20 testes that occupy the whole postovarian intercecal field. Eggs are fusiform, with a long filament at each pole.
Etymology
The specific epithet sebastisci is derived from the generic name of the type-host Sebastiscus marmoratus.
Diagnosis
According to Yamaguti, Microcotyle sebastisci is most closely related to Microcotyle tanago as indicated by the general shape of the body, and the two species can be distinguished by the presence of a prominent conical cirrus in Microcotyle sebastisci. Microcotyle sebastisci differs from Microcotyle ditrematis in the shape and organisation of the genital atrium, and the size and structure of the cirrus. Microcotyle sebastisci also resembles Microcotyle caudata and Microcotyle sebastis in the number of clamps, but they differ in the number of testes and egg size.
Hosts and localities
The type-host of Microcotyle sebastisci is the False Kelpfish Sebastiscus marmoratus (Sebastidae). It was also recorded on two other Sebastidae; the rockfish Sebastodes guntheri and Sebastichthys pachycephalus (currently Sebastes pachycephalus). Yamaguti recorded the Hong Kong grouper Epinephelus akaara (Serranidae) as host of Microcotyle sebastisci. The record of this species on the black Scorpionfish, Scorpaena porcus (Scorpaenidae) is uncertain.
Microcotyle sebastisci was first described from fish from the Inland Sea and Sagami Bay (Japan).
It was also recorded off Nagasaki and Ōita (Japan)
as well as off Naples, Italy.

Nani Soewondo-Soerasno (born 15 August 1918) is an Indonesian lawyer, suffragist, and women's rights activist.
Early life
Soewondo-Soerasno was born in Semarang in 1918 to a middle-class family. Her parents supported her choice to study law in what was then called Batavia (now Jakarta). She graduated in 1942 from the Faculty of Law at the University of Indonesia. While studying, she was assistant to Soepomo, who would become known as the Father of the Indonesian Constitution.
Career
Soon after graduating, Soweondo took a position with the Department of Justice. Soewondo was a member of the NTR Commission (Nikah, Talak, Rudjuk) on marriage inequity set up by the 1949 Women's Congress, serving as secretary. In 1950, the Indonesian government backed this commission and asked it to form new matrimonial legislation.
Soewondo continued to work closely with Maria Ulfah Santoso and the Indonesian Women's Congress in the early 1950s. She was vice-president of the Women's Congress in the 1950s. She served as editor-in-chief of Suara Perwari, the publication of Perwari (the Union of the Women of the Republic of Indonesia). Soewondo also filled the role of president of the legal part of Perwari. In 1955, she helped organize the Perhimpunan Wanita Universitas Indonesia (Association of Indonesian University Women), with herself as inaugural leader.
In 1957, she served as a delegate to a United Nations conference in Colombo on increasing participation in civic life for Asian women. In 1958, she participated in a 'study tour' of Australia to build cross-country links between Indonesian and Australian women's organizations. In 1959, she was awarded a scholarship in honor of Elin Wägner by the Swedish government to carry out research on the history of Indonesian women's rights. Described as a "forthright and experienced" woman, she was one of a number of prominent feminist leaders of the 1950s. Mujīburraḥmān, an Indonesian historian, calls her "a leading activist of women's rights" in post-independence Indonesia.
The main part of her work was aimed at marriage laws. In the late 1950s, Soewondo served as part of a three-member commission to develop the precise wording of the proposed marriage act, which she subsequently advocated for. Soewondo wrote in her book, Kedudukan wanita Indonesia, that the "deplorable situation" of Indonesian women would not improve until legislation to "protect women against polygamy and repudiation" are enacted. She contrasted Indonesia unfavorably with another Muslim nation, Tunisia, which she viewed as being more active in providing legal protection for women in marriage and outlawing child marriage.
She worked to raise the age of marriage for girls, showing "outstanding dedication"; a 1973 research report on child marriage, which she helped author, helped lead to the 1974 Marriage Law reforms. She also worked to combat polygamy and served as the vice-president of Planned Parenthood in Indonesia from 1957. In 1981, she published a book on the status of Indonesian women under the law, which the Australian historian Susan Blackburn notes was unusual for its time period.
Soewondo had five children.

The beautiful woodpecker (Melanerpes pulcher) is a bird species in the woodpecker family (Picidae). It is endemic to Colombia.
Until recently, it was united with the golden-naped woodpecker (M. chrysauchen) of Central America as subspecies. But the different appearance and allopatric ranges argue in favor of recognizing the two as distinct species. According to "Birds of Northern South America" by Robin Restall the back is barred and the belly and breast are white, but that appears to be in error based on photos of the birds in Colombia.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest.
Description
The beautiful woodpecker is a colourful bird about long. It is similar in appearance to the black-cheeked woodpecker and the golden-naped woodpecker but their ranges do not overlap. The sexes are similar apart from the male having a yellow fore-crown while the fore-crown in the female is black. Both sexes have a red mid-crown and yellow nape, and a black mask surrounding the eyes and running to the nape. The lores, cheeks, chin, throat and breast are cream or pale yellow. The mantle and upper wings are mainly black, with some white barring of the flight feathers, and the back and rump are white, sometimes blotched with black. The tail is brown, the lower breast, belly and flanks are barred in black and white, and there is a red patch on mid-belly. The iris is black, the beak is greyish-black and the legs are grey.
Distribution and habitat
The beautiful woodpecker is endemic to the valley of the Magdalena River in Colombia, where it occurs at altitudes of up to or occasionally higher. It is present in both dry and humid forests and plantations, and sometimes in forest remnants and secondary growth.
Ecology
The beautiful woodpecker is largely frugiverous, its diet including figs, bananas, fruits of the Cecropia tree and palm nuts, as well as insects and small invertebrates. It is able to catch flying insects on the wing.

The Jo Stafford Show is a 15-minute musical variety program which aired on CBS in prime time in the 1954–1955 television season. Paul Weston wrote a special theme song for the show.
The show had the same cast of regular performers Stafford worked with during her Chesterfield Supper Club shows from Hollywood. Paul Weston and his Orchestra and the Starlighters provided the music and vocal accompaniments on the television show just as they had done on Stafford's hosted "Supper Club" radio programs.
The television program was done live. During the year it aired, an episode featured loss of her skirt on one show while singing "Let Me Go, Lover!". One of the cast members tripped, and as he fell, a button on his coat caught in Stafford's costume. Her skirt falling along with the actor, Stafford tried holding onto it while singing "Let me go".
The decision to end Stafford's television program was not hers, but that of CBS. At the time of the cancellation, the show's sponsor, Gold Seal Company, contemplated moving the Stafford program to NBC. The loss of the television show was another factor in Stafford's move from Columbia Records, owned by CBS, back to Capitol Records, where she had her first solo recording contract. Stafford received an Emmy nomination in 1955 as Best Female Singer for her work on the program.

Norwegian Forest Owners Association () is an association representing 43,000 owners of forest in Norway. The main functions of the organisation is to assist the members, who are mostly farmers, to manage their forest. This includes forestry plans, part of the cutting of timer and negotiating agreements with lumber mills and paper mills. The association is one of the 13 agricultural cooperatives in Norway and based in Oslo with 366 local groups and eight district organisations, organised as BAs. In 2005 83% of all domestic timber was organised through the association.
The eight regional organisations are Havass Skog, Glommen Skog, Mjøsen Skog, Viken Skog, AT Skog, Vestskog, Sogn og Fjordane Skogeigarlag and ALLSKOG. Both the regional and central associations hold major ownerships of Norske Skog and Moelven Industrier. The associations are members of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO).
History
The first forest owner association was founded along Glomma in 1903, soon to be followed by others. Because of the nature of logging, the associations were organised by river instead of by county. The national association was founded in 1913 as a union between the regional associations. The first mayor task was to buy the Borregaard corporation based around Glomma from the British Kellner-Partington company, that was finalised in 1917. In 1962 the association founded Nordenfjelske Treforedling that opened the Norske Skog Skogn plant in 1966. Norske Skogindustrier was founded in 1972 as a massive merger between various companies throughout the country. The association still owns about 20% of the corporation, that has become the world's largest producer of newsprint. Ivar Aavatsmark served as Director of the association for 40 years, between 1942 and 1982.

Mary Lloyd Jones (born 1934) is a Welsh painter and printmaker based in Aberystwyth. Her works are multilayered and use devices that reflect an interest in the beginnings of language, including early man-made marks and the ogham and bardic alphabets. She has exhibited across Wales and internationally.
Work
Lloyd Jones was born in Devil's Bridge, Cardiganshire (now Ceredigion) and attended art school immediately upon leaving school. Her ambition was always to be an artist. However, she did not begin to exhibit work publicly until 1966, when she was in her early 30s. Ceridwen Lloyd Morgan attributes this relatively late flowering to the fact that she was a Welsh woman from a rural background. As Lloyd Jones has stated: "At times I felt that I belonged to the wrong sex and was living in the wrong time and place to be a successful artist." In 1989 she gave up her job as visual arts officer for the county of Dyfed to become a full-time artist. From this point her work evolved to take the form of large, irregularly shaped paintings which were unstretched. Such works were associated with cloth, stitching and dye-soaking into the cloth. Later she returned to more traditional forms of painting, as well as producing proclamatory banners.
Lloyd Jones's work is greatly inspired by the landscape in which she grew up, a prominent feature of which is the scarred landscape associated with a legacy of lead mining. This sense of place is further augmented by her own Welsh-language cultural inheritance. Ann Price-Owen has referred to her work as that of a custodian of her cultural heritage, which is implicitly language-based. Experiences outside Wales have also provided key stages in her work's development. An interest in early alphabets was precipitated by a visit to Ilkley Moor to view cup and ring marks. Incorporation of such marks into the work led to an identification with the 18th-century Welsh bard, scholar and antiquarian Iolo Morganwg, who created his own bardic alphabet, "Coelbren". She regards the use of scripts such as the ancient ogham script in her work as an oblique reference to the otherness of Welshness. Iwan Bala argues that these works demand some form of contextualising, revealing the artist's concerns and her position within her own culture. In the Summer of 2009 Ruthin Craft Centre showed Lloyd Jones's early textile work, which led to a re-evaluation of this work by a new audience. A second show in 2013 was reviewed in the magazine Embroidery. In February 2013 she was awarded the first Artist Residency at the Old College, Aberystwyth University, and moved into a new studio there. Some of her paintings are in the public collections of the National Library of Wales, Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales and Cardiff University.
Lloyd Jones joined the 56 Group Wales as an associate member in 1971, and was a full member from 1973 to 1986.
In October 2014 she published her autobiography, No Mod Cons, an account both of her struggles to paint and of her attempts to organise a better world for Welsh artists.

Jaguar Land Rover Engine Manufacturing Centre, is an engine producing factory located on the outskirts of Wolverhampton and South Staffordshire. It is strategically built adjacent to the M54 motorway on the i54 business park. Opened in 2014 by Her Majesty, it currently produces Ingenium petrol and diesel engines.
Having already been expanded once in the past, in 2015 it was announced that Jaguar Land Rover would spend £450 million on doubling the size of the engine plant. Once complete, the factory's workforce will increase from 700 to 1,400 people.
Solar Panels
The engine assembly plant is fitted with over 21,000 photovoltaic panels, which produce 5.8MW of energy. This accounts for more than 30% of the plant's energy requirements. The panels have enough energy to power more than 1,600 homes and reduce the plant's carbon footprint by over 2,400 tonnes per year.

Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu and Beja (or Fernando, , 17 November 1433 – 18 September 1470) was the third son of Edward, King of Portugal and his wife Eleanor of Aragon.
Biography
Ferdinand was born in Almeirim on 17 November 1433, and died in Setúbal on 18 September 1470.
He was twice sworn Prince of Portugal (title granted to the presumptive heir to the throne): first between 1438 and 1451, once his older brother became king Afonso V of Portugal and had no children; and for the second time, in 1451, when Prince João was born, but died months later.
When Afonso V's first daughter, Princess Joan, was born (1452), Infante Ferdinand finally lost this title.
In 1452, Ferdinand fled the country looking for adventure. Some say he wanted to go to the north African cities controlled by the Portuguese; others say that he wanted to join his uncle, the King Alfonso I of Naples, in his campaigns in southern Italy. It seems Ferdinand had the hope to inherit his uncle's kingdom, as he had no legitimate children.
However, his brother, King Afonso V of Portugal, as soon as he knew about Ferdinand's escape, ordered to the Count of Odemira, which was patrolling the strait of Gibraltar with a fleet, to intercept the infante's ship and bring him back to mainland Portugal.
Duke of Beja and Viseu
In 1453, his brother, King Afonso V of Portugal granted him the title of 1st Duke of Beja.
When his uncle, Prince Henry died, in 1460, he also became 2nd Duke of Viseu as well. He also succeeded his uncle as Master of the Order of Christ and responsible for the Discoveries (1460–1470).
He was finally allowed to fight in north Africa: first in 1458 he escorted the king to the conquest of the Moroccan city of Alcácer Ceguer; and for a second time, in 1468, he led a Portuguese fleet that conquered and destroyed the port of Anfa (Anafé in Portuguese), today included in Casablanca, which was a barbary corsairs base.
He was buried in the Religiosas da Conceição monastery, in Beja, founded by his wife.
Marriage and children
He married his cousin Beatrice of Portugal (Portuguese: Beatriz) in 1447, daughter of Infante João, Lord of Reguengos (his uncle). From this marriage, Ferdinand had nine children:
Infante João (1448–1472), 3rd Duke of Viseu, 2nd Duke of Beja, 7th Constable of Portugal.
Infante Diogo (1450–1484), 4th Duke of Viseu, 3rd Duke of Beja;
Infanta Eleanor of Viseu (1458–1525), married to King John II of Portugal, becoming Queen of Portugal;
Infanta Isabella of Viseu (1459–1521), married to Ferdinand II, Duke of Braganza;
Infante Duarte of Viseu (1462-died in childhood);
Infante Dinis of Viseu (1464- died in childhood);
Infante Simão of Viseu (1467-died in childhood);
Infante Manuel (1469-1521), 5th Duke of Viseu, 4th Duke of Beja. Became King of Portugal, as Manuel I, following his cousin's (John II) death;
Infanta Catarina of Viseu.

The Tangail Airdrop was a successful battalion-size Para Commandos (India) operation mounted on 11 December 1971 by the 2nd Battalion (Special Operations) (2 PARA) of the Indian Army's Parachute Regiment and the 49 Squadron of the Indian Air Force during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 for the liberation of Bangladesh. The main objective of the operation was the capture of Poongli Bridge on the Jamuna River which would cut off the Pakistani 93rd Brigade which was retreating from Mymensingh in the north to defend the capital of East Pakistan, Dacca, and its approaches. The paratroop unit was also tasked to link up with the advancing Maratha Light Infantry on the ground to advance towards the East Pakistani capital.
Operation
Para drop
A battalion of Para Commandos (India) led by Lt Col Kulwant Singh Pannu was reinforced by an artillery battery of 17 Para Field Regiment, an engineering detachment, an ADS, a surgical team and other administrative troops from 50th (Indep) Parachute Brigade. Tasked to cut off the retreat of the Pakistani troops from the north towards Dacca, the unit touched ground at 4:30pm and were greeted by a jubilant crowd of local people, with some even helping the troops carry their packs and ammunition. The drop was dispersed over a wide area, but the Paras regrouped quickly and commenced their attack. By 7.00pm they had captured their main objective, cutting off the Pakistani 93 Brigade retreating from the north. Link-up with 1 Maratha LI was established after the Marathas broke through at Tangail Road and reached the bridgehead that very evening. The Pakistanis, attempting to retake the bridge rushed the Indian positions that evening, however, were repulsed.
The Tangail Airdrop operation involved An-12, C-119s, 2 Caribous and Dakotas from 11 sqn and 48 Sqn. 49 Squadrons 'the Paraspears', of the Indian Air Force was instrumental in raising and training the 'Kilo' flight of the Mukti Bahini. It was also the Paraspears who led the famed DELTA ORANGE formation of the Tangail drop which dropped troops of the 2 Para regiment which was a vital element in achieving the liberation of Bangladesh. The IAF also carried out feint drops using dummies dropped from Caribou aircraft to hide the true location and extent of the operation. The only hitch was a Hangup from the lead Dakota. One Paratrooper had a static line hangup, who, after carrying out emergency procedures, was dropped safely about 50 miles away.
Pakistani war crimes
Indian Army which took over the Poongli Bridge from the Pakistani Army was "shocked" at "the sight of mutilated bodies of women, whom the Pakistani troops had killed just before fleeing from Poongli Bridge."
Aftermath
The Tangail Airdrop and the subsequent capture of the Poongli bridge gave the advancing Indian Army, assisted by Kader Bahini, the maneuverability to side-step the strongly held Tongi-Dacca Road to take the undefended Manikganj-Dacca Road right up to Mirpur Bridge at the gates of Dacca (Dhaka).
Pakistan Army's 93,000 troops unconditionally surrendered to the Indian Army and India's local ally Mukti Bahini on 16 December 1971.
Battle awards
Indian commander Lt Col Kulwant Singh was awarded the MVC for his leadership in battle. The 2Paras were subsequently the first Indian forces to enter Dacca. For this and their role in Capture of the strategic bridge, the Paras received battle honour for Poongli Bridge and theatre honours for Dacca.

Lydiadas of Megalopolis () was an ancient Greek tyrant of his city Megalopolis in Arcadia. He came to power around the year 245 BC, but after ten years he decided to step down, leading his city to join the Achaean League. As a reward the Achaeans elected him to the post of strategos, that is (commanding general) of the League, for three terms in 234/33, 232/31 and 230/29 BC. In 227 BC he lost the elections against Aratus of Sicyon, but was chosen as hipparch, in this position he fell at the gates of his city during a cavalry charge against the Spartan king Cleomenes III.
Biography
Probably a son of Eudamus from Caphyae, Lydiadas was raised as a citizen of Megalopolis. Almost nothing is known of the steps by which he rose to power, but the sources represent him as a man of an ambitious yet generous character, who was misled by false rhetorical arguments to believe that a monarchical government was the best for his fellow-citizens. His elevation appeared to have taken place about the time that Antigonus Gonatas made himself master of Corinth (244 BC) Pausanias mentions him as one of the commanders of the forces of Megalopolis at the battle of Mantineia (c. 249 BC) against the Spartans under Agis
As he was associated on that occasion with another general, Leocydes, it may be inferred that he had not then established himself in absolute power. If he came to power around 245 BC, he had held the position for power about ten years, when the progress of the Achaean League and the fame of its leader Aratus of Sicyon led him to form projects more worthy of his ambition. After the fall of the tyrant Aristippus of Argos, instead of waiting until he was attacked in his turn, Lydiadas determined voluntarily to abdicate as tyrant and permit Megalopolis to join the Achaean League as a free state. This generous resolution was rewarded by the Achaeans by the election of Lydiadas to the prestigious post of strategos or commander-in-chief of the confederacy the following year 233 BC.
His desire for fame and his wish to distinguish the year of his command through some brilliant exploit led him to plan an expedition against Sparta, which was, however, opposed by Aratus, who is said to have already begun to be jealous of Lydiadas' favour and reputation. Lydiadas, indeed, proved to be a formidable rival; he quickly rose to such esteem in the league as to be deemed second only to Aratus, and notwithstanding the opposition of the latter, was elected strategos a second and third time, holding that important office alternately with Aratus. The most bitter enmity had by this time arisen between the two men. Each strove to undermine the other in the popular estimation. But though Lydiadas was unable to shake Aratus' long-established standing, he maintained his ground, not withstanding the insidious attacks of his rival, and the suspicion that naturally attached to one who had formerly borne the name of tyrant.
In 227 BC, the conduct of Aratus, in avoiding a battle with Cleomenes III of Sparta at Pallantium, gave Lydiadas fresh cause to renew his attacks, but they were again unsuccessful, and he was unable to prevent the appointment of Aratus for the twelfth time to the office of strategos, in 226 BC. Instead, Lydiadas was elected hipparch and had to serve under the command of his rival. The two armies under Aratus and Cleomenes met a short distance from Megalopolis, and though Aratus would not consent to bring on a general engagement, Lydiadas, with the cavalry under his command, charged the right wing of the enemy and put them to the rout, but being led by his eagerness to pursue them too far, got entangled in some enclosures, where his troops suffered severely, and he himself fell, after a gallant resistance. His body was left on the field, but Cleomenes had the generosity to honour a fallen foe, and sent it back to Megalopolis, adorned with the insignia of royal dignity.<ref>Polybius II 44,51 ; Plutarch Aratus 30, 35, 37, Cleomenes 6 ; Pausanias VIII 27,12-15.</ref>

The Pan American Combined Events Cup (Spanish: Copa Panamericana de Pruebas Combinadas) is a track and field competition in men's decathlon and women's heptathlon. Organized by the Association of Panamerican Athletics (APA), newly constituted in 2011, it is an annual contest for combined events athletes representing countries in the region. It is typically held in late May or June.
The competition was launched in 2005 as part of the IAAF Combined Events Challenge as NACAC Combined Events Championships, and was initially organized by the North American, Central American and Caribbean Athletic Association (NACAC), with the first edition taking place in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The event was repeated in San Juan the following year and had its third outing in 2007 in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. The size of the competition was expanded in 2008 as it was renamed the Pan American Combined Events Championships with the organization of the event being transferred to the Pan American Athletics Commission, a subdivision of the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO). It became open to combined events specialists representing any of the countries in the Americas. A record of 40 athletes from 15 countries took part in that edition.
The championships underwent another name change the following year, being held in Havana, Cuba as the Americas Combined Events Cup. Headed by the Cuban Federation President, former Olympic champion Alberto Juantorena, it was incorporated into that year's Barrientos Memorial, Cuba's national track and field championships. No edition was held in 2010 and the event returned under its inaugural moniker for the 2011 season. In the year 2012, the Championships were renamed to its present name. The inaugural Pan American Combined Events Cup took place in Ottawa, Canada.
Cuba's Yordanis García holds the championship record for the decathlon with his score of 8496 points. The heptathlon best is points by American Sharon Day. Four athletes have won at the event on two occasions: Maurice Smith of Jamaica, Ryan Harlan of the United States, as well as Yordanis García and Yorgelis Rodríguez of Cuba.

Millettia laurentii is a legume tree from Africa and native to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The species is listed as "endangered" in the IUCN Red List, principally due to destruction of its habitat and over-exploitation for timber. Wenge, a dark coloured wood, is the product of Millettia laurentii. Other names sometimes used for wenge include faux ebony, dikela, mibotu, bokonge, and awong. The wood's distinctive colour is standardised as a "wenge" colour in many systems.
Wood
Wenge ( ) is a tropical timber, very dark in colour with a distinctive figure and pattern. The wood is heavy and hard, suitable for flooring and staircases.
Several musical instrument makers employ wenge in their products. Mosrite used it for bodies of their Brass Rail models. Ibanez and Cort use it for the five-piece necks of some of their electric basses. Warwick electric basses use FSC sourced wenge for fingerboards and necks as of 2013. It is also used by Yamaha as the centre ply of their Absolute Hybrid Maple drums.
The wood is popular in segmented woodturning because of its dimensional stability and colour contrast when mixed with lighter woods such as maple. This makes it especially sought after in the manufacture of high-end wood canes and chess boards.
The wood is sometimes used in the making of archery bows, particularly as a laminate in the production of flatbows. It can also be used in the making of rails or pin blocks on hammered dulcimers.
The wood may also be used for kendamas. Though a ken could be made entirely out of wenge, it's generally used to substitute a portion of the big/small cups while the rest of the ken is made out of a softer, less dense wood. This concentration of weight in the big and/or small cup facilitates balance tricks such as lunars.
Health hazards
The dust produced when cutting or sanding wenge can cause dermatitis similar to the effects of poison ivy and is an irritant to the eyes. The dust also can cause respiratory problems and drowsiness. Splinters are septic, similar to those of greenheart (the wood of Chlorocardium rodiei).

In 1912, the Chicago White Sox debuted one of the most enduring and famous logos in baseball – a large "S" in a Roman-style font, with a small "O" inside the top loop of the "S" and a small "X" inside the bottom loop.
History of SOX Logo
This logo was first used in 1912.
This is the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team, and the 1919 Black Sox.
With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark blue logo with the large "S" lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block style into the 1940s).
Team Colors
Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were primarily navy blue trimmed with red.

Montezuma County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,849. The county seat is Cortez.
Mesa Verde National Park, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Yucca House National Monument, and Hovenweep National Monument preserve hundreds of ancient Amerindian structures, including the famous cliff-dwellings, found in the county. Montezuma County is also home to most of the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation, home of the Weeminuche Band of the Ute Nation, known as the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, with its headquarters at Towaoc.
History
Montezuma County has been settled since approximately AD 600, and had an estimated population of approximately 100,000, four times its current population, in the 12th century. However, a series of events caused virtually all permanent settlements to be abandoned between 1200 and 1300, and the area was contested between nomadic Ute and Navajo bands until resettlement occurred in the 1870s. Montezuma County was created out of the western portion of La Plata County by the Colorado Legislature in April 1889. It was named in honor of Moctezuma II, who reigned as emperor of the Aztec Empire in Mexico during its decline at the hands of the Spanish invasion. The building ruins in Mesa Verde National Park were thought to be of Aztec origin at the time.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.
A large county, roughly 1/3 of its area is tribal land, 1/3 is federal land (administered by the National Park Service, the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management), and 1/3 private or state/county land. It is also varied topographically, ranging in elevation from about to more than , and from high Colorado Plateau desert to alpine tundra. The county has the second largest reservoir in Colorado, McPhee Reservoir, many other large reservoirs, and hundreds of private lakes and ponds. Much of the county is irrigated cropland, and it produces fruit, large numbers of cattle and sheep, and beans. It is served by U.S. Highways 160 and 491 (formerly US 666), and by Cortez Municipal Airport. It has no rail service, although both Mancos and Dolores were established as railroad towns in the 1890s.

Politics
In its early history Montezuma County favored the Democratic Party. It was one of the few counties in the West to be won by Alton B. Parker in 1904, and along with neighboring La Plata County was one of only two Colorado counties to give a plurality to John W. Davis in the three-way 1924 election. However, since the 1940s Montezuma has been a strongly Republican county: no Democrat since 1968 has won over forty percent of the county's vote in a Presidential election. Recently (28 July 2020), the county government has openly endorsed viewpoints described as far-right by posting web links under a "News" banner on the official county web page. These links have since been removed after community members objected to partisan positions on the county website.
In gubernatorial elections, Montezuma County is also Republican-leaning: in 2010 it was along with neighboring Dolores County one of only two counties to give a plurality to Dan Maes. The last Democratic gubernatorial nominee to win Montezuma County was Roy Romer in 1990 when he carried all but four counties statewide. The last Democratic senatorial candidate to carry Montezuma County was Ben “Nighthorse” Campbell – later to switch to the Republican Party – in 1992.

The Selmer guitar — often called a Selmer-Maccaferri or just Maccaferri by English speakers, as early British advertising stressed the designer rather than manufacturer — is an unusual acoustic guitar best known as the favored instrument of Django Reinhardt. Selmer, a French manufacturer, produced the instrument from 1932 to about 1952.
History
In 1932 Selmer partnered with the Italian guitarist and luthier Mario Maccaferri to produce a line of acoustic guitars based on Maccaferri's unorthodox design. Although Maccaferri's association with Selmer ended in 1934, the company continued to make several models of this guitar until 1952. The guitar was closely associated with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.
Construction
In its archetypal steel-string Jazz/Orchestre form, the Selmer is distinguished by a fairly large body with squarish bouts, either a "D"-shaped or longitudinal oval sound hole, and a cutaway in the upper right bout. The strings pass over a movable bridge and are gathered at the tail, as on a mandolin. Two "moustache" markers are fixed to the soundboard to help position the movable bridge. The top of the guitar is gently arched or domed — a feature achieved by bending a flat piece of wood rather than by the violin-style carving used in archtop guitars. The top is also rather thin, at about . It has a comparatively wide fretboard (about at the nut) and a snake-shaped, slotted headstock. The back and top are both ladder-braced, which was the norm for French and Italian steel-string guitars of the time (unlike American guitars, which frequently employed X-braced tops by this period).
Other models can be more conventional in appearance and construction, with the Modèle Classique, for example, essentially being a standard fan-braced, flat-top classical guitar.
Early days: "Maccaferri" or D-hole guitar
Early models have a large, D-shaped sound hole (the "grande bouche", or "big mouth"), which was shaped specifically to accommodate an internal resonator invented by luthier Mario Maccaferri — this was designed to increase the volume of the guitar and to even out variations in volume and tone between different strings. The scale, at 640 mm, and fretting of the early guitars was very similar to other contemporary guitars (including the Gibson and Martin guitar designs from which most modern acoustic guitar patterns ultimately derive), but with a wide fretboard more typical of a classical guitar; they also had 12 frets clear of the body, although left hand higher fret access was facilitated by a (then novel) cutaway in the upper right bout. These guitars were made in several versions, including gut string (classical), steel string, seven string (Hawaiian) and four string ("Grand" and "Ténor") versions, plus a special four string "Eddie Freeman" model (see below). Many of these guitars, produced during 1932 and 1933, were sold to the UK market via Selmer's London showroom (which also distributed the guitar to regional dealers) and it was during this period that the guitars became known as "Maccaferris" to Britons.
Post-Maccaferri or Oval-Hole guitar
Maccaferri designed the original guitars and oversaw their manufacture, but his involvement with Selmer ended after 18 months. Over the next few years, the design evolved without his input (including some transitional models with round soundholes). By 1936, the definitive version of the Selmer guitar had appeared, with an oval hole in place of the large D-shaped hole, no internal resonator, and a neck with 14 frets clear of the body in place of the original 12. It was officially called the "Modèle Jazz", but also known as the "Petite Bouche" (small mouth) or "Oval Hole". These later guitars also have revised internal bracing and a longer scale length of . The vast bulk of guitars produced after the Maccaferri period were sold in Selmer's native France; these later guitars are always referred to as "Selmers" (as are the earlier guitars by the French).
While Maccaferri may no longer have been around (and his resonator had been abandoned), the later guitars retain many unusual characteristics of his original innovative design, including the cutaway, the world's first sealed oil-bath machine heads and a top that is bent, mandolin-style, behind the floating bridge — something that contributes to the guitar's remarkable volume when played.
Use
Before the advent of amplification, the Selmer guitar appealed to European players the way archtop guitars did in America: it was loud enough to hear over other instruments in a band. The "petite bouche" model has an especially loud and cutting voice, and remains the design preferred by lead players in Django-style bands, while the accompanying rhythm players often use D-hole instruments. (This was the lineup in Django's Quintette du Hot Club de France during its classic period in the late 1930s, and it remains the pattern for bands that emulate it.) Modern exponents of the style often amplify their instruments in concert, but may still play acoustically in small venues and jam sessions. Gypsy jazz players usually couple the guitar with light, silver-plated, copper-wound Argentine strings made by Savarez (or copies of these), and heavy plectrums, traditionally of tortoiseshell.
Today, the Selmer guitar is almost completely associated with Django Reinhardt and the "gypsy jazz" school of his followers. From the 1930s through to the 1950s, however, Selmers were used by all types of performer in France and (in the early days) in the UK. The first Selmers sold in the UK were used in standard dance bands, and were associated with performers such as Len Fillis and Al Bowlly.
In France, the Selmer was the top professional guitar for many years, and is heard in everything from musette to the backing of chansonniers. Leading players included Henri Crolla and Sacha Distel. More recently, the style of guitar (albeit a modification developed by Favino) has been associated with Enrico Macias.
Other Selmer guitars
Though best known for its steel-string D-hole and oval-hole guitars (known initially as the "Orchestre" and later the "Jazz" model), during the Maccaferri period Selmer also made and sold Maccaferri-designed classical guitars, harp guitars, 6- and 7-string Hawaiian guitars, tenor guitars, a 4-string "Grande" model and the "Eddie Freeman Special", a 4-string guitar with the scale-length and body-size of a standard guitar, designed to use with a special reentrant tuning that was briefly successful in the UK market. Most of these instruments featured Macaferri's distinctive D-shaped sound hole and cutaway design, and many contained the resonator. Production of all but the Modèle Jazz ended by the mid-1930s. Selmer also contracted the well-known American luthier John D'Angelico to construct a small number of archtop guitars to be sold under the Selmer brand for the U.S. market; this arrangement was short-lived and apparently only three instruments were constructed, of which a single one (from 1934) is known to survive.
Copies, replicas, and similar guitars
Selmer did not make many guitars — fewer than 1,000 — and the company stopped all production by 1952. Playable original Selmers are rare and command high prices. One of the largest collections was owned by Louis Gallo (1907-1988), a close friend of Mario Maccaferri, who also possessed blueprints of these guitars and was the consultant for the Ibanez CSL copies. Before the current rise in interest in Django and his guitars, other European builders produced instruments that emulated the Selmer design with their own variations. These instruments began to appear in the 1930s with Busato, Di Mauro and—from the 1940s—Jacobacci, Favino, Anasatasio, the Gérôme Brothers, Olivieri, Rossi, Bucolo, Patenotte, Siro Burgassi, and a few others. In the 1970s, Selmer copies were produced in Japan for CSL and Ibanez, and in the 1980s for Saga Musical Instruments under the "Saga" brand. Meanwhile, a few French luthiers continued production. These include Jean-Pierre Favino and, more recently, Maurice Dupont.
Elsewhere, some high grade luthiers have offered Selmer-style guitars. These include Marco Roccia, Jerome Duffell, AJL (Ari-Jukka Luomaranta), John Le Voi, David Hodson, Rob Aylward, Chris Eccleshall, and Doug Kyle in the U.K., Michael Dunn and Shelley D. Park in Canada, Leo Eimers in the Netherlands, Risto Ivanovski in Macedonia and Rodrigo Shopis in New York City. More recently, inexpensive factory instruments from Asia have become available under the Gitane and Dell'Arte/John S. Kinnard brands.
Common departures from the original designs include omitting the internal resonator, adding a scratchplate, using solid (non-laminated) woods, and building D-hole models with a 14th fret neck-join rather than the original 12th fret join.
Surviving original Selmers
The number of surviving original Selmer guitars is not known exactly. Fewer than 200 are publicly known.
Other Maccaferri guitars
Prior to his association with Selmer, Maccaferri had acquired a reputation for building classical guitars with some of the features incorporated into his Selmer design including the cutaway, possibly the D-shaped sound hole, and in some cases, additional bass strings (harp guitars); photographs survive of Maccaferri himself performing on such instruments during the 1920s.
Following his severance from Selmer, in 1939 Maccaferri moved to the United States and became interested in plastic manufacturing. He produced plastic classical and steel-string guitars — of similar shape to his Selmer designs, albeit with F-holes — in the 1950s and 60s, along with many musical and non-musical plastic products. Produced first under his own name, and after 1964 under the name "Mastro", the guitars were of short scale, but accurately fretted and intonated. These instruments were not a huge success at the time and are now considered oddities. However, the many variants of Maccaferri's plastic ukulele enjoyed a considerable vogue in the 1950s and sold in large numbers.
Maccaferri also collaborated with Ibanez guitars in the late 1970s and early 1980s to produce 440 updated versions of his original D-hole design. They were individually signed by him and are considered quite playable and collectable.

Paul Belloni Du Chaillu (July 31, 1831 (disputed)April 29, 1903) was a French-American traveler, zoologist, and anthropologist. He became famous in the 1860s as the first modern European outsider to confirm the existence of gorillas, and later the Pygmy people of central Africa. He later researched the prehistory of Scandinavia.
Early life and parentage
There are conflicting reports of both the year and place of Du Chaillu's birth. The year is variously given as 1831 (the consensus of modern scholars), 1835, or 1839; the date when given is July 31. Accounts usually cite either Paris or New Orleans as his likely place of birth. A contemporary obituary quotes a statement made by Du Chaillu referring to "the United States, my country by adoption, and ... France, my native land." His entry in the 1901-1902 edition of Marquis Who's Who — which was based on information he supplied directly to the editors — says 1838 in New Orleans. His grave marker identifies his place of birth as Louisiana, and the year as 1839.
Edward Clodd, Du Chaillu's friend, told the story differently in his memoirs. Clodd mentioned New York as another claimed location, but asserted that Du Chaillu's true birthplace was the French Indian Ocean island territory of Île Bourbon (now called Réunion). He further claimed that du Chaillu's mother was a mulatto woman. In 1979, historian Henry H. Bucher presented evidence to back Clodd's view, including records of Du Chaillu's father. Bucher argued that Du Chaillu, as a member of the European scientific community, would have tried to obfuscate or conceal the family history that would have labeled him a quadroon. In the 19th century atmosphere of scientific racism, great apes and Sub-Saharan Africans were often considered to both have small cranial capacity, and thus be innately unable to achieve civilization; Du Chaillu's credibility as a scientist and explorer would have suffered as a result. Indeed, comments in a letter by Du Chaillu's contemporary, the ethnologist of Africa Mary Kingsley, indicate that at least some scientists who thought poorly of Du Chaillu knew of his ancestry or other discrediting information about him.
In his youth, he accompanied his father, a French trader in the employment of a Parisian firm, to the west coast of Africa where, at a station on the Gabon, he was educated by missionaries and acquired an interest in and knowledge of the country, its natural history, its natives, and their languages before emigrating to the U.S. in 1852.
Africa
He was sent in 1855 by the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia on an African expedition. Until 1859, he explored the regions of West Africa in the neighborhood of the equator, gaining considerable knowledge of the delta of the Ogooué River and the estuary of the Gabon. During his travels from 1856 to 1859, he observed numerous gorillas, known to non-locals in prior centuries only from an unreliable and ambiguous report credited to Hanno the Navigator of Carthage in the 5th century BC and known to scientists in the preceding years only by a few skeletons. He brought back dead specimens and presented himself as the first white European person to have seen them.
A subsequent expedition, from 1863 to 1865, enabled him to confirm the accounts given by the ancients of a pygmy people inhabiting the African forests. Du Chaillu sold his hunted gorillas to the Natural History Museum in London and his "cannibal skulls" to other European collections; a fine cased group shot by Du Chaillu may be seen in the Ipswich Museum in Suffolk, England. Narratives of both expeditions were published, in 1861 and 1867 respectively, under the titles Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa, with Accounts of the Manners and Customs of the People, and of the Chace of the Gorilla, Crocodile, and other Animals; and A Journey to Ashango-land, and further penetration into Equatorial Africa. While in Ashango Land in 1865, he was elected King of the Apingi tribe. A later narrative, The Country of the Dwarfs was published in 1872.
At the time, he was in great demand on the public lecture circuits of New York, London, and Paris. Although there were initial challenges of his accounts, they came to be accepted, although Encyclopædia Britannica speculated that "possibly some of the adventures he described as happening to himself were reproductions of the hunting stories of natives."
In addition to his zoological work on gorillas, Du Chaillu collected and identified a number of new species to science. He was the first person to scientifically describe the giant otter shrew (Potamogale velox), taking precedence over John Edward Gray's description of the same animal as a mouse instead. He also collected the type specimens for the southern needle-clawed bushbaby (Euoticus elegantulus), the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), and the African pygmy squirrel (Myosciurus pumilio), all West African species. Despite not being an ornithological collector, he collected the types specimens for thirty-nine valid species of African birds. Du Chaillu collected the type series of Amnirana albolabris (Hallowell, 1856) from Gabon.
Northern Europe
After some years' residence in America, during which he wrote several books for the young based on his African adventures, Du Chaillu turned his attention to northern Europe. After a visit to northern Norway in 1871, over the following five years, he made a study of customs and antiquities in Sweden, Norway, Lapland and Northern Finland. He published in 1881 The Land of the Midnight Sun (dedicated to his friend Robert Winthrop of New York), as a series of Summer and Winter Journeys, in two volumes.
His 1889 work The Viking Age, also in two volumes, was a very broad study of the early history, manners, and customs of the ancestors of the English-speaking nations. He labored for eight and a half years and carefully read hundreds of Sagas that describe the life of the people who inhabited the Scandinavian peninsula from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages (including literary remains). This scholarly work demonstrates what is now generally recognized, the importance of the Norse, including Norway, Sweden, and Denmark to the cultural dimension and transformation of British Isles during the fifth to eleventh centuries. This view was then unfamiliar and was ridiculed by Canon Isaac Taylor. This book, in two volumes, is now a very collectible item. In 1900, he also published The Land of the Long Night.
Personal life
Du Chaillu was a friend of Edward Clodd and was present at one of Clodd's Whitsun gatherings at Strafford House, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, in company with John Rhys, Grant Allen, York Powell and Joseph Thomson. He was a member along with a variety of mostly literary figures in author J. M. Barrie's amateur cricket team, the "Allahakbarries".
He died following a stroke of paralysis at St. Petersburg, while on a scholarly visit to Russia as part of his research on the Scandinavian peoples. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

William Hill Brown (November 1765 – September 2, 1793) was an American novelist, the author of what is usually considered the first American novel, The Power of Sympathy (1789), and "Harriot, or the Domestic Reconciliation", as well as the serial essay "The Reformer", published in Isaiah Thomas' Massachusetts Magazine.
Life
Brown was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Gawen Brown and his third wife, Elizabeth Hill Adams. Gawen Brown was from Northumberland, England and was a clockmaker. William was christened at the Hollis Street Church on December 1, 1765.
In 1789, William Brown published the novel The Power of Sympathy. Brown had an extensive knowledge of European literature, for example of Clarissa by Samuel Richardson, but tries to lift the American literature from the British corpus by choice of an American setting. The book drew close comparison to a local scandal and was subsequently withdrawn from sale. He contributed a number of essays to the Columbian Centinel.
Around October 1792, Brown himself withdrew to join his sister, Eliza Brown Hinchborne, at the Hinchborne plantation near Murfreesboro, North Carolina, and began to read law with William Richardson Davie at Halifax. Eliza died in January 1793. Not yet acclimated to the Eastern North Carolina climate, William Brown died of fever, probably malaria, the following August, at the age of twenty-seven.
Works
Brown held the conviction that novels should aim at some high moral purpose.

Bartsia alpina is a species of perennial flowering plant, known by the common name alpine bartsia or velvetbells. It is found in the mountainous regions of Europe and also occurs in Iceland, Greenland and north‐eastern Canada.
Description
Bartsia alpina is a hemiparasitic perennial plant with a woody rhizome, growing to a height of between . The stem is erect and sometimes branched, hairy and purple in colour. The leaves are in opposite pairs, with oval leaf blades up to long and toothed margins. At the base of the plant, the leaves are green, but higher up they are tinged with purple. The corolla is dark purple and is about long. It is narrow at the base and has two lips, an obtuse upper lip and a smaller lower one, with three blunt, equal-sized lobes. It has four stamens fused to the corolla and two ovaries fused to the style. The fruit is an oval brown capsule.
Distribution and habitat
Bartsia alpina has a European Arctic-montane distribution, and is also known from North America. It occurs in the mountainous regions of northern Russia, Finland, Norway and Sweden, and in the Alps and other mountains in Central Europe, as far south as the Pyrenees and south‐west Bulgaria; it also occurs in Iceland, Greenland and north‐eastern Canada.
It has a very restricted distribution in the British Isles, occurring only in a few locations in upland areas in northern England, and in the central Scottish Highlands. It used to occur in damp pasture, in basic flushes and runnels and wet, steep, species-rich banks, but it has largely been eliminated from these habitats by over-grazing and trampling by livestock. It has persisted better away from grazing animals in ledge communities on mica-schist crags.

Erwin von Busse also known as Granand or Erwin von Busse-Granand (12 January 1885 – 10 April 1939) was a German writer, artist, theater director, art historian and critic. His 1920 collection of short stories devoted to erotic male relationships was banned; it was republished in German in 1993 and in an English translation in 2022 as Berlin Garden of Erotic Delights. As a stage director for several years he worked with some of the most prominent figures of his time and he directed the world premiere of James Joyce's drama Exiles in 1919. He devoted himself to painting in his later years, living in exile in Brazil.
Biography
Early years
Erwin Oskar Leopold von Busse was born on 12 January 1885 in Magdeburg. His parents were Lieutenant Hugo Maximilian von Busse (1855–1922) and his wife Marie Louise Elisabeth Helene née Weste (1861–1935). He had a brother Rudolf Maximilian von Busse (1886–1957).
Erwin von Busse went to school in Magdeburg and Kiel. Beginning in 1898, he attended several military schools, ending with graduation in 1905 from the Prussian military academy in Gross-Lichterfelde. He spent the next two years performing his compulsory military service.
Beginning in 1907 he studied law in Munich, changing to art history in 1909. In 1912 he interrupted his studies for a trip to Brazil and a sojourn in Paris.
Art criticism
In 1912 he contributed an essay about Robert Delaunay to the Der Blaue Reiter Almanach. Reproductions of two recent Delaunay works, St. Séverin (1909) and The Window on the City (1911), illustrated the text. This essay has been praised for its "extraordinary insight" into Delaunay, who was soon to prove a critical leader in discovering the principles of expressionist and abstract art. Analyzing a few critical Delaunay canvases, von Busse traced the artist's shift from respect for the physical subject, to fracturing the object into particles formed and colored as "the dynamic needs of the space" require, and finally to excluding all references to the external world so that shape and color become the form and subject of the painting. Delaunay, in von Busse's words, now explores "the problem of space dynamics" without reference to the external world as he searches for the rules of "subjective understanding and representation".
Von Busse returned to his studies before the end of 1912, now at the University of Bern. There he received his doctorate in 1914 with a thesis on ("The Historical Evolution of the Depiction of the Masses in Italian painting").
Theater
Von Busse then turned to the theater and before long settled in Berlin, where he edited , a theater magazine, in 1917. By that year he had also taken up the position of director and dramaturge at the Deutches Theater under Max Reinhardt, a dominant figure in the German-language theater. He directed several productions there in 1918–19. In 1919 he directed a revival of Walter Hasenclever's expressionist play The Son (1916), achieving greater success than Reinhardt had with the original production in 1918.
He moved to Munich and worked for Hermine Körner, who had starred in The Son. There he directed the world premiere of James Joyce's 1918 drama Exiles at the Munich Theater on 7 August 1919.
Other plays he directed included Candida by Shaw and Die Soldaten by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz. By 1925 he was no longer associated with a theater.
Fiction
Von Busse adopted the pseudonym Granand to publish (Erotic Comedy Garden) in 1920. Its five stories depict a variety of sexually charged encounters between men, with characters that range from military school cadets and dance-hall regulars to a foreign businessman and a burglar. Granand wrote that his garden "has crooked, convoluted, and uncontrolled paths" but "over it all the great, hot sun shines, the melancholy moon passes by, and the innocent stars twinkle." There were two editions: a private edition of 100 copies with six illustrations by Rudolph Pütz (1896–1986) and a public edition of a few thousand copies with a slightly different text and five illustrations and a cover design by Ludwig Kainer (1885–1967). Above an enthusiastic review, Der Eigene, a bi-weekly gay newsletter, called the small printing a "luxury edition" and identified the bookstore that was handling sales.<ref name=Eigene> Review of Granand, Das erotische Komödien-Gärtlein.</ref>
Von Busse wrote with discretion to avoid government censorship. Though the Weimar Republic is celebrated for its "radical remaking of sexual norms", and its 1919 constitution prohibited censorship in principle, it also permitted statutes to regulate films, printed matter, and public presentations. For example, the film Different from the Others, which argued for the decriminalization of homosexuality, was released in May 1919 and banned nationwide in October 1920.
Regional courts in Berlin and Leipzig in 1920 and 1921 banned the distribution of von Busse's collection of stories because of "indecency" and ordered all copies confiscated or destroyed. The banned 1920 edition was not reprinted until 1993. Its first English translation was published in 2022 as Berlin Garden of Erotic Delights. Consistent with the 1920 edition, it identified the author as "Granand".
A second set of stories, this time heterosexual, appeared in 1921 as (Lovers' Fairy Tales). With illustrations by Kainer, its stories were "literary imitations of selections from Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra''" (1832). An attempt to ban this volume failed.
Later years
In 1925, von Busse contributed a slight volume to an art history series. By this time he was using a composite name, having added his pseudonym to his birth name to become "Erwin von Busse-Granand".
Using that name he emigrated to Brazil in 1928. In 1931 he took part in the group exhibition (Revolutionary Salon) at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, the first of its annual exhibitions to host modernists.
He became a Catholic in 1933 and in London on 10 April of that year married Simonette Mathilde Kowarick, a wealthy woman and native of Brazil. They had no children. In Brazil he devoted himself to painting, concentrating on the South American landscape. He taught for a time at the Olinda School in São Paulo.
He died in São Paulo on 10 April 1939. A few months later, mounted a memorial exhibition of von Busse's paintings at his galleries in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo; the catalog included several illustrations of von Busse's paintings, two essays about Brazil by the artist, and a brief biography that did not mention his short story collections.

Jackson was a member of the Oakland Raiders, Albany Firebirds, Calgary Stampeders and Ottawa Redblacks.
Early years
Jackson was born on June 10, 1985 in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Dunwoody High School in Georgia for four years. During his senior season, he totaled 93 tackles, two tackles for losses and four forced fumbles. During high school Jackson played at defensive back.
College career

During his sophomore season in 2005, Jackson played in all 12 games and had career high 30 tackles. Jackson made four tackles in his first collegiate start against North Carolina. He added seven tackles which became his career high against Oregon State and then two against Kentucky.
In 2006, as a junior he played in all of the Cardinals 13 games which included the Orange Bowl. He ranked third on the team with 57 tackles and second in the Big East in sacks and tackles for a loss. Jackson led Louisville in sacks with nine and tackles for a loss with 16. In the Orange Bowl he had four tackles and two for a loss, also recording a sack and a fumble recovery. The fumble recovery came with 1:55 left in the second half and was considered controversial as to whether Kenneth Moore of Wake Forest's knee had hit the ground. His fumble recovery was also the first of his Louisville career. After the season, he was named to the second-team All-Big East team.

Sprint kayak is a sport held on calm water (lakes, flatwater streams, etc. with little waves). The paddler is seated, facing forward, and uses a double-bladed paddle pulling the blade through the water on alternate sides to propel the boat forward. Kayak sprint has been in every summer Olympics since it debuted at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Racing is governed by the International Canoe Federation.
History and design
Boats may have one rudder which must be under the hull of the boat. The rudder is controlled by the feet of the paddler (the foremost paddler in multi–person designs). The boat to be designed to be a sit-in, as opposed to a sit-on surf ski.
Crews or individuals race over 200 m, 500 m, 1000 m, or 5000 m, with the winning boat being the first to cross the finish line.
In competition the number of paddlers within a boat is indicated by a figure beside the type of boat; K1 signifies an individual kayak race, K2 pairs, and K4 four-person crews.
A K-3 kayak has been developed in South Africa for use in the Fish River Canoe Marathon.
Modern sprint kayaks are generally made of lightweight composite materials such as carbon fiber and fiberglass; wood was previously used on older kayaks along with steel for some sections of the boat (i.e. the rudder). They are narrow, extremely unstable, and expensive. Due to this, they are not intended to be used in anything other than flat watercourses - they can capsize and/or be dragged underwater in moderate waves. The beam of a flatwater boat is typically barely wider than the hips of its paddlers and requires the paddler to bend their legs in the boat, allowing for a long and narrow shape to reduce drag.
Canoe sprint kayaks are similar to sprint canoes, with both styles of the boat usually at the same club or with the same team.
Paddles used for sprint boats are made out of carbon fiber and/or fiberglass. At the discretion of the paddler, the paddle may be angled to fit with the paddler's stroke. In addition, wingtip paddles, with the upper cusp of the paddle angled to form a cup (like cupping one's hand to paddle water) are often used to assist with speed increases and control in turns and drag while maintaining balance.

James Walsh (4 February 1911 – 26 December 1977) was an Irish hurler who played as a left wing-forward for the Kilkenny senior team.
Born in Ballyhale, County Kilkenny, Walsh first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. He made his debut during the 1932 championship. Walsh immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All-Ireland medals, seven Leinster medals and eight National League medals. The All-Ireland-winning captain in 1932, he was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions.
As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Walsh won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he was a six-time championship medallist with Carrickshock.
Walsh retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1944 championship.
Playing career
Club
In 1928 Walsh was just seventeen-years-old when he was included as a key member of the Carrickshock junior hurling team. That year he won a Kilkenny Junior Hurling Championship medal in that grade, as Carrickshcok secured promotion to the senior ranks following a 2–3 to 1–2 defeat of Wellbrook in the decider.
Three years later in 1931, Carrickshock reached the senior decider, having been runners-up in their inaugural senior championship campaign in 1929. Urlingford provided the opposition on that occasion, however, a 5–8 to 3–8 victory gave Walsh his first championship medal.
Carrickshock lost the next four championship deciders, and it was 1938 before Walsh reached his next senior showpiece. A 2–5 to 1–5 defeat of Éire Óg gave him a second championship medal.
Back-to-back titles proved beyond Carrickshock again in 1939, however, the team was back in a third successive decider the following year. A narrow 1–4 to 1–2 defeat of Mullinavat gave Walsh a third championship medal.
Old rivals Éire Óg provided the opposition in the 1941 county final, however, Carrickshock finally retained the title following a one-point 4–5 to 3–7 victory. It was Walsh's fourth championship medal.
Carrickshock's great run of success continued in 1942 as the club qualified for a fifth successive final. Threecastles, who were appearing in their first decider in thirty-five years, were the opponents, however, a 3–2 to 2–3 victory gave Walsh his fifth championship medal.
In 1943 Carrickshock set a remarkable record in Kilkenny hurling by winning a fourth successive championship. The 3–6 to 1–3 defeat of Mullinavat gave Walsh a sixth championship medal.
Five-in-a-row proved beyond Carrickshock, with the club losing the next three championship deciders. Walsh's last game for the club was the 1946 final defeat by Thomastown.
Inter-county
Early successes
In 1932 Walsh joined the Kilkenny senior hurling team and had the honour of being appointed captain of the side in his inaugural season. He won his first Leinster medal that year following a 4–6 to 3–5 defeat of Dublin. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1932 saw Clare provide the opposition for the first time in almost twenty years. In a low-scoring game, Clare's Tull Considine scored two goals and was foiled for what would almost certainly have been a third. These goals were negated by Kilkenny's three goal-scoring heroes Matty Power, Martin White and Lory Meagher, who scored a remarkable goal from a line ball. The final score of 3–3 to 2–3 gave victory to Kilkenny and gave Walsh an All-Ireland medal while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. At 21 years and 222 days old, he remains one of the youngest All-Ireland-winning captains of all-time.
1933 saw Walsh add a National Hurling League medal to his collection following a 3–8 to 1–3 defeat of Limerick. He later won a second Leinster medal following a stunning comeback against Dublin which produced a 7–5 to 2–5 victory. The All-Ireland final on 3 September 1933 saw a record crowd of 45,176 travel to Croke Park to see Kilkenny face and up-and-coming Limerick. After being level at the interval, the game remained close in the second half until a solo-run goal by Johnny Dunne sealed a 1–7 to 0–6 victory. It was Walsh's second consecutive All-Ireland medal.
Continued dominance
After surrendering their provincial crown to Dublin in 1934, Kilkenny faced Laois in the decider again the following year. A 3–8 to 0–6 victory gave Walsh a third Leinster medal. Another record crowd gathered at Croke Park for the All-Ireland final between Kilkenny and Limerick on 1 September 1935. In spite of rain falling throughout the entire game both sides served up a classic. At the beginning of the second-half Lory Meagher sent over a huge point from midfield giving Kilkenny a lead which they wouldn't surrender. A narrow 2–5 to 2–4 victory gave Walsh a third All-Ireland medal.
Kilkenny dominated the provincial series again in 1936 and Walsh won his fourth Leinster medal following a 4–6 to 2–5 defeat of Laois. The lure of a Kilkenny-Limerick clash brought a record crowd of over 50,000 to Croke Park for the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1936. The first half produced a game that lived up to the previous clashes, and Limerick had a two-point advantage at half-time. Jackie Power scored two first-half goals, while a solo-run goal by captain Mick Mackey in the second-half helped Limerick to a 5–6 to 1–5 victory.
After being dropped in 1937, Walsh was recalled to the team for Kilkenny's unsuccessful championship campaign in 1938. The following year he was appointed captain for the second time and won a fifth Leinster medal following a 2–12 to 4–3 defeat of reigning All-Ireland champions Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland final with Cork on 3 September 1939 is regarded as one of the most famous championship deciders of all-time. The game was an exciting one with an explosive finish, as a spectacular thunderstorm lit up proceedings. Willie Campbell landed a long-range free in the net for an equalising goal for Cork and a draw looked likely. Terry Leahy doubled on a Paddy Phelan 70-yard free to secure the winning point for Kilkenny on the stroke of full-time. The 2–7 to 3–3 score line gave Kilkenny the victory and gave Walsh a fourth All-Ireland medal.
Decline
Walsh won a sixth Leinster medal in 1940 following a 3–6 to 2–5 defeat of Dublin. The All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1940 brought Kilkenny and Limerick together for the last great game between the two outstanding teams of the decade. Early in the second-half Kilkenny took a four-point lead, however, once captain Mick Mackey was deployed at midfield he proceeded to dominate the game. Limerick hung on to win the game on a score line of 3–7 to 1–7.
In 1943 Walsh collected his seventh and final Leinster medal following a 3–9 to 2–6 defeat of Dublin. Kilkenny were later defeated by Antrim in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the greatest hurling shocks of all-time.
A defeat by Wexford in the 1944 Leinster semi-final brought the curtain down on Walsh's inter-county career.
Inter-provincial
In 1933 Walsh was at right wing-forward on the Leinster team that faced fierce rivals Munster in the inter-provincial final. A thrilling contest resulted in a narrow 3–6 to 2–6 victory for Leinster, and a first Railway Cup medal for Walsh.
After back-to-back successes for the southern province, Leinster were back in the decider once again in 1936. A narrow one-point 2–8 to 3–4 victory gave Walsh a second Railway Cup medal.

The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers is an international guideline regulating how rivers and their connected groundwaters that cross national boundaries may be used, adopted by the International Law Association (ILA) in Helsinki, Finland in August 1966. In spite of its adoption by the ILA, there is no mechanism in place that enforces the rules. Notwithstanding the guideline's lack of formal status, its work on rules governing international rivers was pioneering. It led to the creation of the United Nations' Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. In 2004, it was superseded by the Berlin Rules on Water Resources.
Provisions
Applicable to all drainage basins that cross national boundaries, except where other agreement between bordering nations exists, the Helsinki Rules assert the rights of all bordering nations to an equitable share in the water resources, with reasonable consideration of such factors as past customary usages of the resource and balancing variant needs and demands of the bordering nations. It also mandates protection of the resource by bordering nations with respect to water pollution in Chapter 3 (Articles IX to XI) and sets forth recommendations for resolving disputes over usage of such watercourses.
The Helsinki rules consist of 37 articles spread over 6 chapters.
Chapter 2, Article 4 states: "Each basin State is entitled, within its territory, to a reasonable and equitable share in the beneficial uses of the waters of an international drainage basin".
In determining what is reasonable and equitable share, all relevant factors are to be considered together and a conclusion reached on the basis of the whole. The list provided in Article 5 (2) is produced in full below:
1. The geography of the basin, including in particular the extent of the drainage area in the territory of each basin State
2. The hydrology of the basin, including in particular the contribution of water by each basin State
3. The climate affecting the basin
4. The past utilization of the waters of the basin, including in particular existing utilization
5. The economic and social needs of each basin State
6. The population dependent on the waters of the basin in each basin State
7. The comparative costs of alternative means of satisfying the economic and social needs of each basin State
8. The availability of other resources
9. The avoidance of unnecessary waste in the utilization of waters of the basin
10. The practicability of compensation to one or more of the co-basin States as a means of adjusting conflicts among uses
11. The degree to which the needs of a basin State may be satisfied, without causing substantial injury to a co-basin State
Article 6 precludes inherent preference of any use over others. Article 7 prohibits denial of reasonable use to a basin state on the basis of future uses of other states.
Article 8 relates to "existing reasonable uses".
Section 8 (1) states: "An existing reasonable use may continue in operation unless the factors justifying its continuance are outweighed by other factors leading to the conclusion that it be modified or terminated so as to accommodate a competing incompatible use".
Section 8 (2) defines the entry & exit criterion of an existing use.
Section 8 (3) prohibits a use that is incompatible with an already existing reasonable use at the time of becoming operational from being treated as an existing use.
Limitations
Although "an important set of draft rules," according to Stephen McCaffrey of the McGeorge School of Law, the Helsinki Rules do not address independent aquifers, but only those connected to a river. Accordingly, the United Nations decided in 1970 to create a more inclusive set of guidelines, which after more than twenty years of investigation by the International Law Commission resulted in the adopting of the Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses in 1997. The ILA itself addressed this limitation in adopting the Rules on International Groundwaters, also known as the Seoul Rules, in Seoul, Korea in 1986 and the Berlin Rules on Water Resources in 2004, which superseded this guideline.

Benu is a three-Michelin star restaurant located in the SoMa district of downtown San Francisco opened in 2010 by chef Corey Lee, the former Chef de cuisine at the French Laundry. Benu made the list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2019.
Restaurant
Corey Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea and moved to the United States at age five. Prior to opening his restaurant, he was the head chef at The French Laundry, working for Thomas Keller at both The French Laundry and Per Se for a total of nine years.
At Benu, he serves a set tasting menu that features a wide variety of seafood and vegetables, few meat courses, and some sweets. Lee draws from many different cuisines, including Korean and Cantonese. He states that “Benu is open to the influence of all different kinds of cultures. We have Asian influences, of course. We have Western influences. We have influences that are technique-driven. Some are flavor-driven. Some are ingredient-driven. But it accepts all those things and it defines the kind of food we serve.”
Master Sommelier Yoon Ha is the restaurant's beverage director. In addition to the tasting menu, Benu offers an optional beverage pairing that includes beer, wine, and sake. The restaurant is open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday.
Benu is housed on the ground floor of a historic building that dates back to 1922–originally the headquarters of the San Francisco Newspaper Company. Crown Point Press, an art studio, gallery, and bookstore, now owns the building and resides directly above the restaurant.
In 2015, Phaidon published Benu–a collection of recipes and essays that explores the restaurant's food, influences, and collaborators–with forewords by Thomas Keller and David Chang, designed by Julia Hasting.
Awards and honors
Benu currently holds the highest Michelin Guide rating possible: three stars.

Indy Champ (, foaled 21 February 2015) is a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse. After winning his only start as a juvenile in 2017 he showed good form in the following year when he won three races and finished third in the Mainichi Hai. He emerged as a top-class performer in 2019 winning the Tokyo Shimbun Hai in February and going to take both of Japan's open age Grade 1 mile races, the Yasuda Kinen and the Mile Championship. In the following years he won the Yomiuri Milers Cup and was placed in both the Yasuda Kinen and the Mile Championship.
Background
Indy Champ is a dark bay horse with a white star and stripe bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During his racing career he was trained by Hidetaka Otonashi and raced in the blue and red colours of the Northern Farm affiliate Silk Racing.
He was from the twelfth crop of foals sired by Stay Gold a horse whose wins included the Dubai Sheema Classic and Hong Kong Vase in 2001. He went on to sire many major winners including Orfevre, Gold Ship, Nakayama Festa, Rainbow Line and Fenomeno. Indy Champ's dam Will Power who won four minor races in five seasons on the track between 2009 and 2013 was a half-sister to several winners including Real Impact (Yasuda Kinen, George Ryder Stakes) and Neorealism (Queen Elizabeth II Cup).
Racing career
2017: two-year-old season
On 28 December 2017 at Hanshin Racecourse Indy Champ made his racecourse debut in a 1400-metre event for previously unraced juveniles and won narrowly from Amore Jody and twelve others.
2018: three-year-old season
Indy Champ made a successful start to his second season when he won a minor race over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 13 January. He was then stepped up in class and distance for the Grade 3 Mainichi Hai over 1800 metres at Hanshin in March when he started at odds of 3.1/1 and finished third of the ten runners, two and a quarter length behind the winner Blast Onepiece. In April at the same track he was beaten just over a length when he came home fourth behind Tower of London in the Grade 3 Arlington Cup. Indy Champ was dropped back in class in June and finished second to the filly A Shin Twinkle in a minor race over 1600 metres at Hanshin. At Chukyo Racecourse on 14 July he started favourite for a race over 1600 metres and won from the four-year-old Clear The Track. After a break of more than five months Indy Champ returned to the track on 16 December and won the Motomachi Stakes over 1600 metres at Hanshin.
2019: four-year-old season
On his first run as a four-year-old Indy Champ started the 1.7/1 in a fifteen-runner field for the Grade 3 Tokyo Shimbun Hai over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 3 February. Ridden by Yuichi Fukunaga he raced on the inside rail and turned into the straight in sixth place before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish. He opened up a clear advantage before holding off the late challenges of Red Olga and Satono Ares to win by half a length and a head. On his next appearance he came home fourth behind Danon Premium in the Yomiuri Milers Cup at Kyoto on 21 April after he failed to settle in a slowly-run race.
In the 69th edition on the Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres over 1600 metres at Tokyo on 2 June Indy Champ was partnered by Fukunaga and went off at odds of 18.2/1 in a sixteen-runner field. Almond Eye started the odds-on favourite while the other contenders included Danon Premium, Aerolithe (Mainichi Okan), Persian Knight (2017 Mile Championship), Mozu Ascot (winner of the race in 2018), Keiai Nautique (NHK Mile Cup) and Stelvio (2018 Mile Championship). After racing in fifth place as Aerolithe set the pace Indy Champ threaded his way through the field in the straight, took the lead in the final strides and won by a neck, with the fast-finishing Almond Eye a nose away in third. Fukunaga commented "He was tuned up well, was in great shape, and had a good draw, so I just tried hard not to miss our break. He tends to get distracted when he's up front so I kept him off the pace. We were up against fierce competition, but I believed that he had a good chance as long as I didn't make any mistakes and he certainly responded beautifully to our expectations".
After a break of four months Indy Champ returned in the Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 6 October in which he raced in second place for most of the way before finishing third behind Danon Kingly and Aerolithe. On 17 November he was one of seventeen horses to contest the 36th running of the Mile Championship at Kyoto and with Kenichi Ikezoe in the saddle he started the 5.4/1 third choice in the betting behind Danon Premium and Danon Kingly.The other runners included Al Ain, Mozu Ascot, Red Olga, Persian Knight and Diatonic (Swan Stakes). Ikezoe tucked Indy Champ in behind the leaders in fourth place on the inside before making a forward move exiting the final turn. He went to the front 150 metres from the finish, broke clear of his rivals and won by one and a half lengths from Danon Premium. Ikezoe, who took the ride at short notice when Fukunaga was suspended, said "I was told that he is a bit unstable at the start but he broke well and we were able to race in good position while eyeing Danon Premium. He responded really well when asked at the lane".
For his final run of the year Indy Champ was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse to contest the Hong Kong Mile on 8 December and started joint-favourite alongside the local champion Beauty Generation. Ridden by Damian Lane he struggled to obtain a clear run in the last 400 metres and although he kept on well he was unable to reach the leaders and came home seventh of the ten runners behind Admire Mars.
In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Indy Champ was voted Best Sprinter or Miler taking 211 of the 274 votes. He also finished second to Win Bright in the poll to determine Best Older Male Horse, receiving 118 votes to the winner's 136.
2020: five-year-old season
Indy Champ was ridden by Yuichi Fukunaga in all of his races as a five-year-old. He began his fourth campaign on 1 March at Nakayama Racecourse when he raced over 1800 metres and came home fourth behind Danon Kingly, Lucky Lilac and Soul Stirring in the Grade 2 Nakayama Kinen. On 26 April he ran for the second time in the Yomiuri Milers Cup and started the 0.6/1 favourite in an eleven-runner field. He settled in third place as Lance of Puraana set the pace from Besten Dank before moving up on the outside to take the lead 200 metres from the finish and winning easily by two lengths. Fukunaga later commented "I thought he really shouldn't lose and the small field made reading the race easy... He has a lot of quirks but that was part of the attraction. I had the impression from before being asked to ride him that he was a difficult horse and that he had difficulties at the break. Now, a lot of that has been fixed." On 7 June at Tokyo the horse attempted to repeat his 2019 success in the Yasuda Kinen and started the 6/1 second favourite behind Almond Eye. He raced in mid-division before angling to the outside to make rapid progress in the straight but after moving into second place behind Gran Alegria he could make no impact on the leader and lost second place to Almond Eye in the final strides.
Indy Champ was expected to resume his season in the Sprinters Stakes over 1200 metres at Nakayama in October but bypassed the race after experiencing "pain in his right hindquarters". After being off the track for five and a half months the horse attempted to defend his Mile Championship title at Hanshin on 22 November and went off the 7.8/1 third choice in the betting behind Gran Alegria and Salios. He settled in seventh place before moving up on the outside and gaining the advantage from Admire Mars 200 metres out, but was caught by Gran Alegria in the closing stages and beaten three-quarters of a length into second place. On 26 December Indy Champ ended his campaign in the Grade 2 Hanshin Cup over 1400 metres in which he started the 0.5/1 favourite but despite producing a strong late run from the rear of the sixteen-runner field he came home third behind the fillies Danon Fantasy and Maltese Diosa.
In the 2020 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Indy Champ was rated on 119, making him the equal 57th best racehorse in the world.

Harold Smith (1926 – February 19, 2005) was a noted investigator and detective.
Smith represented Lloyd's of London and many other insurance companies for over 50 years, specializing in fine-art and jewelry theft. He also was a security consultant for leading jewelers, museums and art galleries in the United States and overseas, including Sotheby's, Christie's, the Smithsonian, and the Getty Museum.
Among his cases were the largest gold robbery in the history of the United States and the master theft of 13 paintings from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990, which included a remarkable Vermeer, "The Concert."
Smith, who had an unusual appearance in latter years – an eyepatch and rubber nose as a result of skin cancer – was featured in the 2005 documentary film Stolen. The film was dedicated to Smith's memory. Ulrich Boser's 2009 book, The Gardner Heist, gives an in-depth recounting of the many leads Smith followed in his investigation of the stolen paintings. In passing, it also provides biographical details about Harold Smith himself.
Born in the South Bronx, Smith attended local Catholic schools and then the Merchant Marine Academy in New York. After the Second World War he became an insurance adjuster for Lloyd's. It was while working in merchant shipping that Smith contracted a dry-skin condition and allowed himself to be subjected to experimental treatments. Smith was covered with oil and exposed to full-body ultraviolet light, which developed into skin cancer throughout his body. Eventually he lost a lung, his right eye and finally his nose, along with all sense of smell.
He was the father of eight children.

HMCS LaSalle was a that served with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic and in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. She was named for LaSalle, Quebec.
LaSalle was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 4 June 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 11 December 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN on 29 June 1944 at Quebec City.
Background
The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a "twin-screw corvette", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name "frigate" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.
Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.
River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.
Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy.
Service history
After working up in Bermuda, LaSalle she returned to Canada in October 1944 and joined escort group EG 27 for local convoy escort. During her time with EG 27, she fought in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. She remained with the group performing anti-submarine patrols and support duty until June 1945. In June she sailed to the west coast where she was paid off at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 17 December 1945.
She was sold to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia in 1947 and stripped and sunk as a breakwater in Kelsey Bay, British Columbia in 1948.

Villa DeSales, built in 1877–1878, is a large five-by-three bay, three-story frame High Victorian Gothic dwelling with a two-story south service wing, located at Aquasco, Prince George's County, Maryland. The historic home is significant for its architectural character which includes a complex of six 19th century outbuildings. This architectural style is an unusual one in Southern Maryland, an area heavily agricultural historically. The large size of the house, the decorative slate roof, amount and variety of cornice and gable trusses, brackets, and pendants; and the well preserved interior with original Gothic Revival-style lighting fixtures and parlor and bedroom furnishings make the house exceptional. In the rear yard are seven domestic and agricultural outbuildings in good condition. The stable is the only High Victorian Gothic barn or stable in Prince George's County.
Villa DeSales was built for George Forbes (1844-1931) and his wife, Fanny Bowling Forbes (1853-1929), near her family home in Aquasco. The Bowling and Forbes families were large landowners in southern Prince George's and neighboring Charles County, Maryland during the 19th century.
Villa DeSales was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

The Sanvitale conspiracy () was a plot to assassinate Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, and members of his family at the baptism of his new-born son Alessandro in 1611. The conspiracy may also be referred to in Italian as the , "conspiracy of the feudal lords", or as the , "conspiracy of 1611".
The plot was exposed and the conspirators were arrested and tortured. They were found guilty of lèse-majesté and ten of them were publicly executed in Parma on 19 May 1612; the event was called the , or "great justice", and attracted attention throughout Italy and abroad. The gran giustizia brought immediate advantages to the Farnese, who were at the same time rid of troublesome rivals and enriched by the appropriation of their money and lands. However many, including some in powerful foreign courts, believed that the plot had been entirely fabricated by Ranuccio for exactly these purposes. Ranuccio's reputation was seriously and permanently damaged. The question of whether the plot was real or a fabrication is still open.
Background
The Sanvitale conspiracy was the third plot against the Farnese family in the space of seventy years. The first was the successful conspiracy, supported or instigated by Ferrante Gonzaga, of Giovanni Francesco Anguissola, Gianluigi Confalonieri, Agostino Landi and Alessandro, Camillo and Gerolamo Pallavicino to assassinate Pier Luigi Farnese, who was stabbed to death by Anguissola and two hired killers in Piacenza on 10 September 1547. The second was the failed conspiracy of Claudio Landi, Prince of Val di Taro, with Giambattista Anguissola and Giammaria and Cammillo Scotti to assassinate Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma in 1582, following which Landi lost the Val di Taro to the Farnese, and the other conspirators lost their heads.
Barbara Sanseverino was heiress to the fief of Colorno, which her ancestor Roberto Sanseverino, Conte di Caiazzo had received from Francesco Sforza in 1458. She had married on 6 September 1564, in her fifteenth year, Giberto IV Sanvitale, Duca di Sala, and following his death in 1585 had obtained from Ottavio Farnese a decree that allowed her to pass Colorno to their only son Girolamo Sanvitale. In the early 1600s this was contested by Ranuccio Farnese on the grounds that the fief could not pass by maternal succession. He claimed Colorno, and sent troops to occupy it.
