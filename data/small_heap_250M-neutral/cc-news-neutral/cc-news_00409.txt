You don't have to tell the Raptors players or coaching staff that the team's work on the defensive glass this season has left quite a bit to be desired.
There have been several games where an inability to haul in a board or two late has given an opponent the opportunity to steal a victory out of the clutches of defeat. This happened most recently at Washington on Thursday, a game that saw the Raptors absolutely crushed on the glass.
Toronto ranks just 19th in the NBA in defensive rebound percentage and 18th in defensive rebounds per 100 possessions. While the team has been elite at offensive rebounding, the story has been quite different at the other end. Whether it's good defensive sequences ruined by allowing an extra look, simple bad luck, or bad technique, it's an issue that needs to be cleaned up.
To that end, the coaching staff keyed in on that area before Friday's back-to-back closer against Portland.
“We talked about it, everywhere (against Washington) we had issues,” Jonas Valanciunas explained to Postmedia as they made their way out of a happy Raptors locker room.
“Not boxing out, not putting enough effort, not sandwiching so, trying to put your mind on it before the game to do a better job on the boards.”
Valanciunas led the team with eight boards in the blowout, 130-105 win and while the 17-4 Raptors advantage in the offensive rebounding totals was a major storyline, grabbing 25 defensive boards on 73 Portland shots compared to just 32 Portland defensive rebounds on a whopping 99 Toronto shots was also impressive.
They got back to basics and upped the desire level.
“Rebounds, you've got to put effort in. Sometimes the ball bounces funny, sometimes it's not enough effort,” Valanciunas said.
“(Against Portland) we focussed on rebounds and we did a good job. First of all we boxed out so that led us to get rebounds.
“It's just effort how hard you fight, how hard you want it.”
The trick now will be not letting that just be a one-night thing. It must be a consistent, constant focus.
LETTING THEM FLY
Valanciunas chuckled when someone jokingly called them Ray Allen after their latest big night from beyond the three-point arc.
Both Valanciunas (four) and DeMar DeRozan (10) set career highs for three-point attempts, nine Raptors hit at least one three and the team hit 19 in all, two off of the franchise record.
Valanciunas has now hit a pair of treys in two straight games and in 3-of-5. He's hit 15-of-32 overall, including 10-of-18 since Jan. 1. He's not Dirk Nowitzki or Kristaps Porzingis out there, but he's becoming a 7-footer that can make opponents pay for leaving them open. Dwane Casey has been saying since training camp that one day Valanciunas will be a legitimate floor spacer. Casey always made it seem like that day was a year or two in the distance, but Washington was starting to panic when they spotted up and while Portland largely ignored them out there, it clearly was a mistake.
Asked if he's feeling comfortable as a three-point shooter, Valanciunas nodded.
And about a player like Jusuf Nurkic backing off and daring them to fire away?
“I mean, if they are going to give me space, I'm going to shoot.”
The six made three-pointers by DeRozan tied their career-high, set on Dec. 21 at Phladelphia and they nearly had seven, with one long shot being ruled a two-pointer because they had a toenail on the line.
Five of their 10 career games with at least four makes have come this season.
Asked if it was more surprising to see DeRozan let so many flies or Valanciunas, Fred VanVleet said it was an easy answer.
“Oh DeMar for sure,” VanVleet said.
“We'd seen J.V. shoot them last year. They thought about it a lot. You could tell they were on the verge of doing it (but didn't) … DeMar, so set in their ways to be one of the best mid-range guys the league has seen in a long time, for them to shoot 10 times from three is a big jump from last year.”
DeRozan said they aren't surprised that opponents aren't closing out on Valanciunas yet, because “they still go under (screens) on me on three-pointers.”
EAGLES ALL THE WAY
Kyle Lowry often sports a Philadelphia Eagles or Villanova cap, no surprise since he's a proud Philadelphia native.
After defeating Portland, Lowry said they were still trying to figure out the plan for Sunday's Super Bowl, which will kick off not long after the Raptors finish playing Memphis on Sunday.
Lowry says an Eagles upset over New England would be a huge deal in Pennsylvania.
“It would mean a lot, just for the city of Philadelphia, the fan base. It's been a long time since we had a championship, besides the Phillies,” Lowry said.
Philadelphia is in a bit of a drought. The Phillies won the World Series in 2008 and 1980, the 76ers last won in 1983 and the Eagles have never won a Super Bowl (including a loss to New England where the score was tied entering the fourth quarter) and last won a pre-Super Bowl NFL championship in 1960.
Lowry's prediction: “Eagles 27, Patriots 21.”
OG OK?
OG Anunoby went right to the back in the fourth quarter after taking a bump but Casey said: “He's OK. I'm sure their brother hit them harder than that.”
Anunoby's older brother Chigbo is 6-4, 324 and played in the NFL. Casey is likely correct.
MEMPHIS AT TORONTO TIPOFF
SUNDAY,12 P.M., TSN4
SCOUTING REPORT
This has been a challenging year for the Grizzlies, just 11-21 since firing David Fizdale, but the team went 6-7 in January, a marked improvement. Injuries have hurt, with star point guard Mike Conley Jr. healthy for only 12 games.
MARQUEE MATCHUP
Dillon Brooks vs. DeMar DeRozan
Brooks, from Mississauga, has been one of the bright spots for Memphis. They were named to the Rising Stars Challenge at all-star weekend and has been a steady starter at small forward and a much-needed Grizzlies draft success story (he was picked 45th last summer).
DID YOU KNOW?
Grizzlies holding out stellar sixth-man (and long-time Raptor-killer) Tyreke Evans ahead of Thursday's trade deadline.
Hong Kong: Activity in China's factories expanded at its fastest pace for eight months in May, official data showed Thursday (May 31), as demand at home and overseas improved despite brewing trade tensions with the United States.
The purchasing managers index came in at 51.9, up from 51.4 last month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said, in line with a Bloomberg News survey.

The reading, the first monthly economic indicator to gauge the world's second-largest economy, was well above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.
NBS analyst Zhao Qinghe said in a statement that high-tech manufacturing and improved export orders both contributed to the growth.
The May reading marks the fastest rate of expansion since September despite US President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs on China, and Beijing's vows to hit back.
The rise in new export orders "is perhaps due to frontloading by importers in fear of a possible trade war", Nomura chief China economist Lu Ting said in a research note.

Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard warned that the growth may not be sustainable.
"It appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand," they said.
China curbed activity in heavy industries in the country's northeast during winter months in an effort to reduce surplus capacity and lessen the heavy smog that typically blankets the region.
A manual count of contested votes in northern Iraq's Kirkuk region in the federal elections started yesterday with monitoring by judges.
Following the May 12 elections, the electronic vote counting was controversial, leading many to object to the results and demand the re-count. Due to these demands, approximately 160,000 votes are expected to be recounted in six additional more regions.
The Iraqi parliament earlier in June voted in favor of amending Iraq's election law, allowing votes to be recounted manually, a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Federal Court.
After the elections, Iraqi Turkmens and several Arab and Kurd groups in Kirkuk protested alleged fraud in the country's first parliamentary elections since the defeat of Daesh. Confusion has gripped Iraq since the win by Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr's electoral alliance with communists, even as negotiations to form a new government are underway. Protesters claimed their votes were illegally changed in favor of Kurdish parties by local officials at polling stations.
Prime Minister Haydar al-Abadi, who was defeated as their alliance came third, said the government's investigations of the elections stemmed from serious violations made by the independent election commission. Thus, the nine-member independent commission was dismissed and will be replaced by judges.
According to intelligence services, tests of electronic voting machines, used for the first time in Iraqi elections, produced varied results, appearing to give credence to the fraud claims.
Less than half of Iraq's 24-million electorate took part in the elections, dumping the old guard in favor of Sadr's alliance followed by a list of former fighters o
f the Hashd Shaabi alliance that last year played a key role in the defeat of the Daesh terror group.
LONDON: Caroline Wozniacki's honeymoon on grass was short-lived as they became the 11th women's seed to fall on the first three days at Wimbledon in a 6-4 1-6 7-5 second-round defeat by Ekaterina Makarova on Wednesday.
The Danish second seed, who won the Eastbourne tournament last week, fought to the bitter end against the tenacious Russian, succumbing on the sixth match point after an absorbing match lasting two hours and nine minutes on Court One.

Makarova, three days short of their 30th birthday, broke early to take command of the first set.
Wozniacki complained about a swarm of insects on court and asked for repellent spray which seemed to sting them into action as they won five games in a row before claiming the second set.
Makarova came back strongly, however, and looked poised for an easy victory when they led 5-1 in the third.
Wozniacki produced their best tennis, though, to save three match points when 5-3 and 40-0 behind and saved another before breaking to level the set.

With both women playing fine tennis and moving each other all round the court, Makarova earned three more match points and converted the second.
"I am so happy I played my game. It doesn't matter what the score was, I couldn't win with a lot of match points, but I kept fighting and playing an aggressive game and finally it worked," Makarova said after their second victory in nine meetings with Wozniacki.
"I was really nervous... I was a little bit 'hurry up' because I thought I needed to be more aggressive, but I am so happy I got calm at 5-5 and did my work again.
"When it was 5-5 I started thinking about those match points on my serve at 40-0, but I told myself 'no, you are not going to lose this match'. I forgot it and started over."

Although smoking has long been associated with being thin, a recent genetic study suggests that a tendency to have excess body fat, especially around the waist, is also tied to a person's odds of being a smoker.
(Reuters Health) - Although smoking has long been associated with being thin, a recent genetic study suggests that a tendency to have excess body fat, especially around the waist, is also tied to a person's odds of being a smoker.
The findings might indicate that extra body fat influences the likelihood of taking up smoking and how heavily a person smokes, or that the urges to overeat and to smoke may share some genetic origins, the authors note in The BMJ.

"These results highlight the role of obesity in influencing smoking initiation and cessation, which could have implications for public health interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence of these important risk factors," writes the study team, led by Robert Carreras-Torres at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.
The authors did not respond to a request for comments.
The researchers analyzed data from the UK Biobank and the TAG Consortium on more than 450,000 people of European descent. These databases contain genetic, medical and lifestyle information for their volunteer participants.
Past studies, the authors note, have already linked genetic variations known as SNPs to both obesity and smoking, suggesting that particular SNPs increase a person's vulnerability to both forms of "addictive behavior" - overeating and smoking. It's not clear, however, if people who smoke stay thinner because smoking curbs appetite, or even if smokers really do stay thin.

To avoid the confusing influence of smoking's effect on appetite, the researchers didn't just look at participants' actual body mass and other body fat measurements. They also created a genetic profile of predicted body traits based on a person's SNPs. Using both real measurements and this genetic profile, the team then analyzed each person's smoking history.
For actual body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, the researchers found that every additional 4.6 kilograms/meter squared was associated with a 5 percent lower risk of being a current smoker but also a 12 percent higher risk of ever having been a smoker, compared to never-smokers.
The same real-BMI increment was also linked to a smoking-intensity increase of 1.75 cigarettes per day for current and former smokers combined.
When researchers looked at the genetic body fat profile, however, they found that each incremental increase in projected BMI based on SNPs was linked to 24 percent higher odds of being a current smoker and an 18 percent increase in odds of being a former smoker.
Projected increases in waist circumference and body fat percentage based on genetic profile were similarly linked with increases in the odds of ever having smoked and increased smoking intensity.
Genetic body type was not linked with odds of smoking cessation, though. This detail and others lead the authors to suggest that rather than genetic predisposition to addictive behavior, excess body fat itself might influence cravings for nicotine.
Whatever the relationship between excess body fat and smoking, interventions to help people avoid these health risks need to take both into account, the authors conclude.
People may be tempted to start smoking to help them lose weight, said Lucy Popova, a researcher at the Georgia State University School of Public Health in Atlanta who wasn't involved in the research. Smoking decreases appetite because nicotine, the primary addictive chemical in tobacco, activates various receptors in the brain, and some of these receptors are on the nerve cells that regulate appetite and eating behavior, they said.
"Starting smoking in order to lose weight is a really bad idea. On one hand, you might weigh a couple of pounds less, but this weight reduction might come from lean muscles and not fat," Popova said.
Also, research shows that smokers, while having lower BMI, tend to have more fat around their abdomens than non-smokers, which is worse for health than simply having a high BMI, they said.
"On the other hand, smoking causes cancers, heart diseases, stroke, bad breath, yellow teeth, and all sorts of other negative consequences, including death. Smokers also have a harder time exercising due to the shortness of breath, so this makes losing weight even more difficult," Popova noted.

Report reveals deep pockets of deprivation in the Waikato
TOM LEE/STUFF Holland Road in Fairfield is in one of the most deprived areas in Hamilton and in the country.
For the country's poorest streets, look no further than Fairfield in Hamilton.
Even parts of Tokoroa, Huntly and Ngāruawāhia fair better.
A local government report has revealed that Waikato residents are living in one of the most deprived regions in the country.
TOM LEE/STUFF Housing was better than many other areas in New Zealand.
"The report showed that education was a big issue in the Waikato, as was income, crime and health. Housing is better, but everything else is worse than the New Zealand median," the report's lead author said.

* Digital census feared to worsen under-count of those under pressure and struggling
The data, using 2013 Census statistics, revealed 61 per cent of Hamilton residents live in areas of high deprivation. The top five deprived areas are all in Fairfield, not far from the city centre.
TOM LEE/STUFF What drags Fairfield down is the education, income, crime and health of its residents.
In 2013, the population was 141,612, meaning 86,383 people lived in areas of high deprivation.
Life is comfortable for those in the Waipa District, particularly in Cambridge, but there are deep pockets of poverty in Hamilton.
The report - called Socioeconomic Deprivation in the Waikato Region: Using the Index of Multiple Deprivation to Understand the Drivers of Deprivation - was presented to Waikato Regional Council.
TOM LEE/STUFF Areas of Fairfield ranked worse than Bader.
The Auckland researchers introduced a new tool to measure deprivation to better identify what drives poverty. The tool - the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) - was developed using data from government departments and 2013 Census statistics.
It identified drivers such as employment, income, crime, health and education across nearly 6000 areas (also known as data zones) in New Zealand.
"This report shows us that the mix of drivers for deprivation across the territorial authorities are totally different - you can't do a blanket policy across everything," report writer Rachael McMillan said.
"The report has thrown up some surprising statistics that just go to show that even district-level deprivation can mask real local issues."
The report defines socioeconomic deprivation as falling below the adequate standard of living when compared with the majority of New Zealanders.
Those who are identified as deprived have insufficient access to food, education, health care and other resources.
The Waikato is the 11th most deprived of the 16 regions in New Zealand. Canterbury is the least deprived and Gisborne is the worst.
However, Hamilton has the second most deprived data zone in New Zealand for income and crime and the third most deprived for heath.
Waharoa, in the Matamata-Piako District, has the second-most deprived zone for education, but the district overall has low deprivation.
McMillan hoped the report would help local governments.
"The key element is the localised response options for localised issues - the benefit of more detailed information.
"The IMD is part of building an understanding of our communities and what their needs are. We need a grounded approach to guide decision-making and this tool adds to the building blocks of our knowledge," they said.
"The IMD helps to show where we should focus our efforts."
Of the 61 per cent of the 141,612 Hamilton residents living in high deprivation areas, half were in the most deprived zones.
Other Hamilton suburbs that contained areas of high deprivation were Bader, Dinsdale, Enderley, Frankton, Melville and Nawton.
"The report we've produced has more detailed data than we've seen before on social challenges across Waikato.
"Some of the data compiled is completely new through the measures used - crime and health indicators, to give two examples.
"The intention here has been to make this a usable and informative detailed document – and that's what we've produced. Professionals and volunteers working in communities where there are social challenges will not be surprised by the themes and findings in this report."

“It's difficult to think anything but pleasant thoughts while eating a homegrown tomato.” — Lewis Grizzard
Tomato season has arrived and local farm markets are brimming with sensational, seasonal fruit of all sizes, shapes and colors. At the market you may find tomatoes that are deep red and rotund, or petite poppers of bright orange and yellow, dusky purple or pale pink heirlooms, or pale green orbs just the right size for breading and pan frying, or pureeing for cake batter.
A wildly popular component of the American diet year round, seasonal summer tomatoes are now at the pinnacle of perfection. Richly ripe, and saturated with sun soaked sweetness, tomatoes are a conscious cooks' dream ingredient. Sliced thickly and seasoned with just a spritz of sea salt, tomatoes embody the sun, each heat soaked slice rendering fabulous flavor.
Once considered toxic, tomatoes supposedly became an accepted ingredient in 1820, when a sea captain consumed a basket of tomatoes in front of a large crowd. When they survived their sizeable snack, the spectators were won over to the fruit and have consumed them copiously ever since. While the tomato is the fruit of a flowering plant, it is considered a vegetable for culinary use, and was designated a vegetable by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1893!
Tomatoes provide a superior source of lycopene, a powerful, natural antioxidant that may have the capability of offering protection against sunburn and certain cancers. High in fiber, tomatoes may benefit the body by being a cholesterol lowering food and a blood sugar stabilizer. Among their other significant health benefits, consuming tomatoes may help repair lungs damaged by bad air or cigarette smoking, combat heart disease, save vision, and provide anti-aging nourishment for the brain.
Beautiful and beneficial, tomatoes are an ever so versatile crop. Whether chopped into sauces and salsas, blended into silky bisques or soups, piled on platters and paired with creamy fresh mozzarella or tangy goat cheese and finished off with a shower of fresh basil leaves and extra virgin olive oil, layered with zucchini, eggplant and fresh herbs and baked until bubbling, tomatoes make a sublime summer meal.
Savor summer's heat as you prepare a delicious life!
Hot Tomato Toast
Makes 8 servings
2 large garlic cloves, minced
Sea salt or Kosher salt
8 tablespoons olive oil
3 Tablespoons white wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
1 pound of tomatoes (use any variety, super sweet cherry tomatoes would be lovely)washed and sliced
Freshly ground black pepper
8 slices of sturdy bread, baguette, ciabatta, etc. cut about 1 inch thick
1 cup of chopped fresh herbs ( basil, parsley, chives, thyme or any of your favorites)
2 very ripe avocados, peeled and mashed
Mix garlic together with a pinch of salt in a bowl and mash with a fork to make a paste. Add half of olive oil and vinegar. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and toss until well coated. Let sit for 30 minutes to blend flavors.
Meanwhile prepare a grill for medium high heat. Brush both sides of the bread slices with remaining olive oil and grill until nice brown grill marks appear, but do not blacken. Remove bread from grill and divide avocado mash between the 8 slices. Add herbs to tomato mixture, then divide tomatoes between the bread slices. Sprinkle with a dash of salt and serve.

A Toronto police officer who refused to shoot the man suspected of plowing a van into crowds of pedestrians on Monday, killing 10 people, was praised for restraint in the face of a suspect who claimed to have a gun.Video footage showed the police officer staring down the suspect at gunpoint in the middle of a street, while the man pointed what appeared to be a gun and shouted "Kill me." The video, obtained by CBC News, showed the suspect repeatedly pulling an object from their side and aiming at police.The arrest was praised as a welcome example of police restraint in the midst of chaos, coming just minutes after a white rental van plowed into a lunchtime crowd in north Toronto, killing 10 people and injuring 15 in one of the most violent incidents in Canadian history.As the suspect shouted "Kill me," the officer replied, "No, get down." When the suspect said, "I have a gun in my pocket," the officer responded: "I don't care. Get down."Toronto police identified the man arrested as Alek Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill, a neighbourhood close to Toronto."It's quite apparent that the suspect was trying to be executed. They were really looking for 'suicide-by-cop,'" Gary Clement, a retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police superintendent with 34 years experience of policing, told Reuters.The Toronto Police Service declined to name the officer involved in the stand-off, but Clement said they appeared to be a "very seasoned and mature officer.""I would say this individual met the right police officer," Clement said. "Nobody knows how they're going to react. In this situation a lot of it comes down to muscle memory. This guy reacted in a very mature manner."Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said the officer's behaviour reflected the "high caliber of training that takes place."They are taught to use as little force as possible in any given situation," they said.It helped that the officer had a clear view of the suspect, who was out of the van and pacing between the sidewalk and the arresting officer, Clement said.The non-violent end to the standoff won plaudits on social media."Wow, at how these Canadian cops brought in this suspected killer," said Twitter user Stuart A. Thompson in a posting.Police in the United States have been criticized for being too quick to pull the trigger after a series of high-profile police shootings and deaths of suspects during arrest.Witnesses in Toronto expressed horror at the murders.Young Lee, a 56-year-old attorney, looked out their third-floor office window on Yonge Street and was shocked to see medics attempting to resuscitate two of the victims."I've never seen violence like this here in Toronto," Lee said. "I felt a mix of rage and a lot of sympathy for the victims."
It's what Peterborough city council would reconsider, putting the cart before the horse, as residents from a neighbourhood in Peterborough's west end were up in arms over a proposal to build a Tim Hortons with a drive-thru at the corner of a new subdivision along Parkhill Road West and Chandler Crescent.
READ MORE: Proposed Tim Hortons drive-thru draws concerns from Parkhill Road residents in Peterborough
Residents like Galen Eagle who presented at council on Monday night, were concerned with the timing of the Tim Hortons construction project while the roadway and intersection construction were still under development.
“I would ask city council to at least hold off on approving this commercial development until significant improvements are made on Parkhill Road and particularly at Parkhill Road and the Chandler Crescent intersection,” said Eagle. “A drive-thru at this location is simply not a good idea.”
That feeling was echoed by their neighbour Randall Skelton who told council, it's not the right time for this development to take place.
“My concern was traffic and my concern was timing but my real concern was that we got it right,” said Skelton.

It appeared those around council table got the message, loud and clear, as both councillors, Henry Clarke and Don Vassiliadis, said roadway development should come first before commercial projects took shape.
“Reconstruction of Parkhill Road is necessary before any other development like a Tim Hortons or drive-thru restaurant goes in there,” said Vassiliadis.
Clarke applauded all sides in coming to an agreement.
“Thank you to the staff for working with the developer, and to the developer themselves for agreeing that this should not happen until the road is constructed.”
Council then heard a presentation by professional and local artist and Ad-hoc Arts Committee member Sarah Gibeault who made a presentation to council asking them to consider implementing a new property tax class for artist-run hubs, and cultural incubators like the artist-run facility at Water and Hunter streets, located in the old Commerce Building.

“You are undoubtedly aware that Peterborough is losing affordable spaces in its downtown as it undergoes a process similar to the Toronto market of gentrification and densification,” said Gibeault. “Incidentally, these artists are forced out of the area through rising rents.”
City staff will bring a report back to council regarding the tax break incentive and its potential, while consulting with the Ad-Hoc Arts Committee and the province to examine options as in Toronto where they have created a new tax category for non-profit art hubs in the community.
WASHINGTON: KT McFarland, picked by President Donald Trump to be the US ambassador to Singapore, withdrew from consideration for the job on Friday after their nomination became stalled in the US Senate.
McFarland was on Trump's presidential transition team and later appointed deputy national security adviser under Michael Flynn.
Trump nominated McFarland last May to be the US envoy to Singapore. When the US Senate did not act on the nomination by the end of 2017 the White House resubmitted their nomination in early January.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in December that McFarland's nomination had been delayed due to concerns about their testimony to Congress over communications with Russia.
McFarland had said in a written response to a question from Democratic Senator Cory Booker, a foreign relations committee member, that they were "not aware" of communications between Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn and Sergei Kislyak, when Kislyak was ambassador to Russia.
However, the New York Times reported early in December that it had obtained an email McFarland sent on Dec 29, 2016, the day former President Barack Obama's administration authorized new sanctions against Russia, saying Flynn would talk to Kislyak that evening.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about their contacts with Russia, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors delving into the actions of Trump's inner circle before they took office.
On Friday, McFarland, a former Fox News national security analyst, said in a letter to Trump, "I am asking that you withdraw my nomination to be the US Ambassador to Singapore."
"I have come to this decision reluctantly, because I believe in your mission," they wrote. A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters.
Trump said in a statement, "KT served my administration with distinction. Unfortunately, some Democrats chose to play politics rather than move forward with a qualified nominee for a critically important post," they said.
McFarland wrote that they believed Trump had "laid the foundations for a new foreign policy that puts America's interests ahead of, but not at the expense of, our obligations to others."
"Know that I have no intention of withdrawing from the national debate and I want to help you in whatever way I can."
Experts have urged overweight women trying to have a baby to slim down before sex.
The call comes after new research showed a rising risk of serious birth defects as the body mass index (BMI) of mothers increased.
Women of reproductive age should be encouraged to "adopt a healthy lifestyle and to obtain a normal body weight before conception," said the authors.
It was already known that being obese heightens the chances of a woman giving birth to a child with malformations that can affect physical appearance or the functioning of nerves and organs.
But the new study revealed a sliding scale of risk that went up as weight increased.
Researchers analysed data on more than 1.2 million live singleton births in Sweden, recorded between 2001 and 2014.
Among normal weight mothers with a BMI of 18.5 to 24, a total of 3.4% had children with birth defects.
Overweight mothers with a BMI of 25 to 29 had a birth defect risk of 3.5%. The rate of birth defects went up to 3.8% for obese women with a BMI of 30 to 34, and rose to 4.2% and 4.7% for higher categories of obesity.
BMI is a measurement obtained by dividing weight in kilograms by height in centimetres squared. It takes account of different stature when assessing weight.
The scientists, led by Martina Persson, from Sweden's Karolinska Institute, wrote in the British Medical Journal: "Risks of any major congenital malformation and several subgroups of organ specific malformations progressively increased with maternal overweight and increasing severity of obesity.
"For women who are planning pregnancy, efforts should be encouraged to reduce adiposity in those with a BMI above the normal range."
Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said: "Poor diet in pregnancy can affect the future health of unborn children. We already advise women to aim for a healthy weight before pregnancy and to be active and eat healthily while pregnant."
In 2013, the incumbent Liberal MLA John Rustad defeated NDP challenger Sussanne Skidmore-Hewlett by nearly a 2 to 1 margin (53 per cent to 27 per cent).
In 2009, Rustad defeated NDP candidate Byron Goerz by over 1500 votes (56 per cent to 35 per cent).
History & Geography: A large rural riding that spans the centre of the province, Nechako Lakes is a descendant of the old Omincea riding, which the Social Credit party held for 40 years, except for the 1972 election. The main corridor of the riding is Highway 16 from Vanderhoof to Houston, but goes as far north as Bulkley House, and far south as Eutsuk Lake. The area between Vanderhoof and Fort St. James has voted for the Liberals by 5-to-1 margins in recent elections, while the NDP has traditionally held support in Burns Lake.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their would-be partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), have made major progress in talks on forming a coalition government but remain at odds on issues like labour rules, a senior SPD member said on Friday.
As they emerged from lengthy talks that Merkel hopes will ultimately secure their fourth term and end political impasse in Europe's largest economy, SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said the parties had taken a “leap forward.”
“But we also saw that we have differences on some topics,” they said.
Senior conservative Peter Altmaier said Friday's talks had been good and the parties were optimistic but a “very tough stretch of road” lay ahead.
The parties became embroiled in another dispute over migration on Friday, with some SPD members saying they wanted to revisit January's coalition blueprint that said the parties did not expect annual migration to exceed 220,000 per year because they were annoyed that Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies seemed to be considering this as an upper limit.
But SPD deputy Ralf Stegner later said the parties had reached a deal. In an apparent defeat for the SPD, the wording of that migration prediction remained the same - as pushed for by the CSU, which calls for a migrant cap.
Stegner said the figure described “expected migration numbers” and beyond that the parties stood by the right to asylum enshrined in Germany's constitution.
They said the SPD had to make compromises: “We can't make progress on our issues without giving something in return.”
But they trumpeted an agreement on a “modern and transparent immigration law” as a success for the migrant-friendly SPD. The parties agreed to encourage skilled migration using criteria such as qualifications, age and language skills.
The two camps aim to finalise a deal for four more years of a “grand coalition” by the end of the weekend or early next week, some four months after an inconclusive election plunged Germany into unaccustomed political uncertainty.
But Merkel said, upon arriving for talks, that they faced divisions in crucial areas, adding: “We have goodwill to overcome them, but there is still a lot of work ahead for us.”
The parties have agreed some eye-catching measures, including a 50 percent tax write-down for fleet electric cars and a 12-billion-euro public investment programme to improve sluggish data networks, documents seen by Reuters showed.
In the field of labour rights, where the SPD wants to signal to its members that it has set its stamp on the deal, the SPD and conservatives agreed to the right for employees in companies with more than 45 employees to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work.
But long lines of text highlighted in yellow showed the parties had yet to decide on the exact wording of that agreement.
PROGRESS
Other agreements included to raise child benefits by 25 euros per child per month. Senior SPD member Katarina Barley said there would be a women's quota for management in the civil service after the last government focussed on this for firms.
The parties also agreed to give German authorities the ability to deprive people with dual citizenship of their German citizenship if they fight abroad for an extremist organisation.
They said they wanted to start allowing collective lawsuits. Consumer associations and politicians had called for class-action lawsuits to be made possible during the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal.
As they arrived for talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz said their party would insist on more progress in labour law and healthcare, where the party hopes to reduce differences in the service experienced by the privately and publicly insured.
They made some progress by agreeing to boost funds for hospitals for restructuring, digitalisation and new technologies.
The centre-left SPD has sagged further in polls since suffering its worst postwar result in the Sept. 24 election.
Many SPD activists, who must ratify any coalition deal in a postal ballot, would prefer to see their party reinvent itself in opposition rather than join another coalition with Merkel after serving as junior partner from 2013 to 2017.
Several politicians from both blocs suggested they may need until Monday and Tuesday to reach an agreement, with Schulz stressing they were not under time pressure. But Horst Seehofer, Merkel's Bavarian ally, said: “So far, there is no reason to expect we will need longer than Sunday.”
Will Ikea lose its way after the death of its almighty founder Ingvar Kamprad? Observers reject the notion, or at least downplay the risks facing the orphaned group.
"Ikea has no leader," industrial economics researcher Magnus Henrekson warned in an interview with Sweden's paper of reference Dagens Nyheter, suggesting the company could lose its compass without its guiding light following Kamprad's death on Saturday at the age of 91. After founding their flat-pack furniture company at the age of just 17, Kamprad devoted their entire life to developing it into a worldwide behemoth, remaining involved in the running of the group until the end. Known simply as "Ingvar" to their employees, from the stores' sales staff to senior executives, Kamprad kept a paternalistic eye on their "Ikea family," whom they rewarded with generous bonuses despite their well-known reputation for frugality. A method the British newspaper The Guardian in 2004 described as "some kind of cult, albeit a cult that worships untreated pine and Allen keys."
"He has always been here as a guide to inspire us," Andreas Hovare, an Ikea employee of 17 years, told AFP after a minute of silence held on Monday in Ikea's stores in Sweden.
So who will take on that role now?
Their three sons Peter, 49, Jonas, 47, and Mathias, 44, who all work for Ikea, will try to fill their father's shoes. But they have lived their lives out of the spotlight. Most Ikea employees "have no relationship to the three sons," Ulf Johansson, the head of Lund University's Centre for Retail Research, told AFP. In a joint statement after Kamprad's death, the brothers vowed to "honor their legacy."
None of them preside over the three main divisions of the Ikea empire, though they do hold key positions: Mathias at Inter Ikea Holding (which owns the Ikea concept and brand) and the Interogo Foundation, Jonas at Ingka Holding (which operates the stores) and Peter at Ikano (the banking and real estate company owned by the family).
Bertil Torekull, a friend and confidant of Kamprad's, says doomsayers who predict post-Ingvar woes at Ikea have nothing to fear.
"You can never rule out a war between the three brothers... But they're smart enough to understand they've inherited a goose with golden eggs and to keep Ikea on course," Torekull, the author of the 1998 book "The Story of Ikea," told Dagens Nyheter. While the three brothers are "pale copies" of their father, they yield "immense" influence over the group, according to Johan Stenebo, a former Ikea executive who served as Kamprad's assistant for three years. As did their father, who only stepped down from the board of Inter Ikea at age 87 but remained a senior adviser until their death.
Despite that, "the rules are very clear, the Kamprad family cannot hold a majority on the board of directors," recalled Lars-Johan Jarnheimer, Ikea heavyweight and chairperson of the supervisory board of Ikea's Dutch holding company Ingka Holding B.V. and chairperson of the board of Ikea Group, in daily Svenska Dagbladet. If there are any darks clouds on Ikea's horizon, it is how it will adapt to a rapidly changing market - in particular whether it will be able to make up for its slow foray into e-commerce. In 2017, online sales totaled 1.7 billion euros, accounting for just 4.4 percent of global sales of 38.3 billion. One thing is certain: thanks to its complex structure and success, Ikea will not be going public anytime soon, said Ulf Johansson. "Ikea has nothing to gain from it," they said.

“Grey's Anatomy” star Jesse Williams is dating stunning SportsNet New York anchor Taylor Rooks — sources exclusively tell Page Six — after moving on from their breakup with Minka Kelly earlier this year.
We hear that Williams and Rooks were spotted together at Kevin Hart's comedy show at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, NJ, over Memorial Day Weekend on a date.
An insider told us: “They are eager to keep their romance under wraps. He's been going through a difficult divorce [from Aryn Drake-Lee], but he's found solace with Taylor.”
Williams filed for divorce last year.
The source added of Williams and Rooks, “The two slipped into Atlantic City for 24 hours” on Saturday.
Oddly, the pair were rumored to have stayed at an Atlantic City hotel — the Ocean Resort Casino — before it opens next month, as the only two guests in the 1,400-room resort. (Sounds like it could be a romantic version of “The Shining.”)
But sources close to the TV star — as well as a rep for the hotel — shot down the cozy creepy concept.
Rook has become a rising star for their “TimeOut With Taylor Rooks” YouTube show and podcast, which has recently included interviews with guests including Meek Mill, Dion Waiters and Dwyane Wade.
Reps for Rooks and Williams did not comment.
Infinity War and Avengers 4 have been advertised as the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it, hinting at the deaths of some major Marvel characters at the hands of the mighty Thanos and their Black Order. While it's not clear if Hulk will make it through the battle alive, actor Mark Ruffalo hinted on social media that they won't be returning to the role. However, the actor's contract with Marvel Studios has not been fulfilled, leading many to believe that the Hulk could appear in the next phase of the MCU.
In a new social media post, Mark Ruffalo posted a picture of themselves in the motion capture gear that they say they found on Reddit. The actor is seen walking and carrying a bindle, which several fans think is a nod to the original Hulk TV Series. The actor captioned the photo with, "saw this on Reddit. Haha. My last day on IW. The final exit." Fans have taken Ruffalo's comment of "the final exit" to mean that he's not coming back as Bruce Banner or the Hulk.
Obviously, the post could just be from the final day of filming Infinity War or Avengers 4 and that's all that Mark Ruffalo means by that. It's been reported that Ruffalo is still under contract with Marvel Studios, so we could possibly see the actor return as the Hulk in the next phase. But, that will almost certainly not include a standalone movie since Universal still has the rights to distribute any movie focused primarily on the character. That could change in the near future, but as of right now, that doesn't seem very realistic.
Chris Hemsworth's contract with Marvel Studios is complete and they have admitted that they would like to return as Thor at some point. Hemsworth and Taika Waititi had so much fun making Thor: Ragnarok that they've discussed the possibility of a 4th installment. That's far from official news, but if they did, Mark Ruffalo would almost certainly have to return as well. The onscreen chemistry between the two, even when Ruffalo is in motion capture gear, is a big component of why Thor: Ragnarok works as well as it does.
Mark Ruffalo might be done with the Hulk character for now, but it's unclear what the future holds. Ideally, a standalone Hulk movie would be what Marvel fans want to see, but as previously noted, that probably will not happen any time soon. Infinity War and Avengers 4 may be the last time that we see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner on the big screen, which may be the result of a battle with Thanos and their Black Order that ends in death. We're only a few short months away from Infinity War hitting theaters, so hopefully we'll get some answers then. For now, you can check out the picture of Hulk wrapping production below, from Mark Ruffalo's Facebook page.

The level of photocopying and downloads going on in Nigerian tertiary institutions is significantly high. There is need therefore for a system through which authors and publishers would be adequately compensated for their works. This was the position of the National Working Group of Reproduction Rights Societies of Nigeria (REPRONIG), as they rose from a two-day meeting on the copyright licensing in tertiary institutions.
Incorporated in the year 2000, REPRONIG is an umbrella body of various copyright owners' associations, including Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) Academic and Non-fiction Authors Association of Nigeria (ANFAAN) and National Association of Translators and Interpreters (NATI). Others are Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Nigerian Publishers Association (NPA) and Photographers Association of Nigeria (PAN).
Representatives of these bodies had met in Abuja to strategize on the implementation of licensing for copyright reproduction in Nigerian higher institutions.
In fact, the major focus of the two-day meeting of the NWG was to develop a framework for collective management and licensing of rights in tertiary institutions for the benefit of authors and publishers.
The group, which was chaired by the immediate past Vice Chancellor, Landmark University, Professor Aize Obayan, was also charged with the responsibility of examining and defining roles of the various stakeholders in the efficient implementation of the licensing for copyright reproduction. It was also expected to recommend appropriate strategies for ensuring that authors and tertiary institutions maximize the benefits derivable from the system of collective management of rights, and consider the terms of a draft licensing framework.
The NWG was organized in collaboration with the Association of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities (AVCNU) and with support from the Nigerian Copyright Commission.
Meanwhile, participants at the meeting were drawn from the National Universities Commission (NUC); National Board for Technical Education (NBTE); National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE); Nigerian Law School and the heads of tertiary institutions. Also at the meeting were representatives of various associations under REPRONIG.
The lead facilitator was the former Chief Executive Officers, Australian Copyright Agency and Vice President, International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organizations (IFRRO), Mr. Jim Alexander.
Inaugurating the National Working Group last week, Director General, Nigerian Copyright Commission, Mr. Afam Ezekude, stated that the occasion has provided an opportunity for sharing of information on the importance development in copyright administration as well re-emphasized the relevance of copyright system to national development.
Admitting that the distribution of copyright content has assumed worrisome dimension in the country, the DG called for a strong synergy between right owners, investors in creative works, tertiary institutions as well as commercial enterprises. “It is against this background that we commend the present initiative of REPRONIG in adopting the dialogue and enlightenment approach as a prelude to its licensing drive “It is our expectation that this will provide a platform for more intense engagement towards finding an effective solution to the issue of appropriate remuneration for reprographic activities of organized institutions and the private sector”, the DG said.
At the Nigerian Copyright Commission, the DG said, efforts are on-going to reform the framework of the copyright protection to proactively respond to the challenges of the digital environment. Earlier, the Chairman, REPRONIG and President, Nigerian Academy of Letters, Professor Olu Obafemi, stated that the meeting was in recognition of the important role participants had to play in rescuing the tertiary book industry in Nigeria.
Noting that Nigerian authors were some of the most brilliant and celebrated in the world in various disciplines, including fiction and non-fiction, they however decried the pitiable fortunes of authors and publishers.
According to him, the inauguration of NWG was a demonstration of the Society's new policy of inclusiveness and consultations towards addressing the collective management of rights in the literary field, as a first step in finding enduring solutions to some of the challenges that threatened its sustainability. “Studies have confirmed the huge volume of photocopying and reckless abuse of copyright that goes on in our tertiary institutions. One would have thought that the heads of these institutions, themselves being authors, would be more concerned. “Unfortunately, the experience of the REPRONIG in the last two decades of its operation has been one of total neglect and even disdain from the institutions. “With the exception of Covenant University, no other university in Nigeria has ever deemed it fit to obtain a reproduction license.”
Adding: “By taking a blanket license, a tertiary institution will not only be avoiding the legal repercussion of the activities of its staff and students, it will also be showing the need to respect copyright, promote and encourage creativity”, the Prof stated.
The chairperson noted that members of the Working Group were carefully chosen to represent all major stakeholder groups, including the agencies responsible for the setting of standards for tertiary institutions. “If Nigerian institutions are to be globally competitive, it is imperative that that we begin to insist on global best practices. Together we speak the same language and that is to ensure adequate recompense for the authors and publishers.”
While commending the Federal Executive Council for recently approving the ratification of four copyright treaties, Professor Obafemi tasked government on early deposit of the instrument of ratification. “And to translate this to concrete gains for Nigeria, we also appeal to government to hasten the transmission of the draft Copyright Bill to the National Assembly for early passage”, they said.
Ahead of the meeting, Professor Obafemi had visited NUC with their team, where they sought the collaboration of the Commission in managing the rights of authors and publishers particularly at the tertiary level. “REPRONIG is willing to collaborate with NUC in addressing issues of piracy, plagiarism, photocopying, digital downloads and other abuses of copyright in Universities “It therefore requests the NUC to include the availability of proper licensing and rights management policy as part of the requirements for the accreditation of universities.”
They stated that “while REPRONIG welcomes the increasing use of electronic libraries in universities, it insists on adequate standards to protect the interest of authors, publishers and guarantee the sustainable growth of the local book industry.”
Several papers were presented at the meeting. The Executive Secretary, REPRONIG, Barrister John Essien, took the meeting on how to reposition REPRONIG for actualization of its goals.
They also highlighted the association's mandate, objectives, its activities as well as challenges, and expressed the need for universities to have licenses to reproduce.
According to him, an institution can have only one license to enable the students and lecturers reproduce as stipulated by the body.
According to Essien, lack of litigation was not as a result of ignorance of the activities of copyright violators. Rather, right owners appeared overwhelmed by the level of impunity at which literally works were reproduced. “The vision of REPRONIG was to have efficient management system for literary works. The mission is to ensure fair recompense for authors and publishers. If these do not happen, we have not started”, Essien said.
An international consultant – former Vice President and Treasurer, IFRRO and former CEO Copyright Agency of Australia, Mr. Jim Alexander, spoke on the global perspectives of operations and benefits of right reproduction organizations, the tariffs, licensing and distribution of royalties as well as development of framework and strategy for licensing.
At the end of their deliberations, the NWG observed the need for affordable, convenient, timely and flexible access to materials in Nigerian Tertiary Institutions. Aware that it was practically impossible for authors to know all the places, where their works are used or negotiate payment terms, they expressed the need for collective administration of rights.
The meeting also observed that the global average contribution of publishing to a nation's GDP is 5.49 per cent, translating to $22.2billion out of Nigeria's 2016 GDP of $405.1billion.
Describing the current system of data collection and management on the secondary use of copyright works in the tertiary institutions as inadequate, it expressed the need for creating a need for effective framework for data collection.
Considering its observations, Working Group developed a framework for the introduction and management of copyright licensing agreements in tertiary institutions. According to it, license agreements should be made with the tertiary institutions, subject to review every three years; the agreements should include a clause specifying that parties are free to agree on rolling over of agreements or review based on the results of monitoring usage, while the tariff payable under the agreements should be based on the number of students per institution.
It also recommended that the permissible limit of reproduction under the license should be restricted to not more than 20 per cent of the material.
Meanwhile, the scope of the license agreement should include both hard copy and digital materials, while license agreement should provide for flexibility on allowable alternative formats for visually impaired and print disabled users.

The Dodgers included oft-derided reliever Pedro Baez on their National League Division Series roster, and their manager, Dave Roberts, framed the decision as an easy choice.
Speaking before Game 1's first pitch Friday at Dodger Stadium, Roberts stopped short of saying they will deploy Baez as their primary set-up man for closer Kenley Jansen, as they did for much of the regular season. Still, they spoke confidently about the 29-year-old right-hander, the subject of significant scorn from the team's fans.
“Ultimately, Pedro has been a big part of what we've done all year,” Roberts said. “I trust him. Arguably, he's been our high-leveraged reliever outside of Kenley all year. So, I just think it makes sense.”
For the season, Baez authored a 2.95 earned-run average over 64 innings. But fans still recall their past postseason failures, and, this year, their flareups coincided with the team's. They logged a 20.77 ERA over the first three weeks of September, seemingly hit around every night.
Baez then struck out seven of the last 12 hitters they faced over the season's final week. Roberts hinted at the move Wednesday, when they stressed the importance of recency in roster decision-making.
Baez's candidacy was also bolstered by their competition. The Dodgers opted against keeping nascent base-stealing threat Tim Locastro. Two other candidates for a bullpen spot, rookie right-handers Walker Buehler and Brock Stewart, struggled in September. Another, left-hander Luis Avilan, got hurt.
Buehler and Stewart have traveled to Camelback Ranch, where they will continue to throw in the off chance the club calls on them later on this month.
Confidence behind Kelowna's bid to host the 2020 Memorial Cup is growing.

We have the perfect venue, and we've made significant investments in infrastructure across the City but more importantly, we have the most supportive and engaging community in Canada,” Dyas said.
The Committee estimates Kelowna could see an economic boom ranging from $12 – $15 million.
The host for the 2020 Memorial Cup will be announced in Calgary next October.
The last time the Rockets hosted the Memorial Cup was in 2004 — capturing the cup on home ice.

Actress and liberal activist Cynthia Nixon, one of the stars of the hit television series "Sex and the City," announced on Monday they would run for governor of New York, challenging incumbent Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination."I love New York, and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor," Nixon, 51, said on Twitter.Her campaign sets up a battle for the Sept. 13 primary between a celebrity on the left of the Democratic Party and a moderate governor who is often mentioned as a possible presidential hopeful in 2020.Cuomo, 60, the son of late New York Governor Mario Cuomo, is seeking their third term. The general election is Nov. 6. If successful in both the primary and general elections, Nixon would become New York's first female and first openly gay governor.A statement by Nixon's campaign called them a progressive alternative to Cuomo, referring to the governor as a centrist whose aides were mired in legal trouble. It also made note of the state's role in operating New York City's antiquated and much maligned subway system.An accompanying video, which shows Nixon at home with their wife, Christine Marinoni, and their young son Max, also addresses income inequality."Our leaders are letting us down," Nixon says in the video. "We are the most unequal state in the entire country, with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty."Nixon is aligned with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who is politically to the left of Cuomo. The two men have feuded over issues such as public transit and housing in the nation's largest city.Cuomo's office had no immediate comment.In an opinion poll by Siena College, Cuomo held a lead over Nixon of 66 percent to 19 percent, according to results released on Monday before Nixon's announcement. The poll, conducted March 11-16 by telephone, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Word of a potential Nixon campaign was first reported by NY1 television on March 6.Nixon could be banking on their celebrity to overcome an incumbent with long ties to the Democratic Party establishment.In Cuomo's 2014 re-election, a primary challenger with little name recognition, Zephyr Teachout, won roughly 34 percent of the vote to Cuomo's 62 percent, leading to speculation Cuomo might be vulnerable to a challenge from a well-funded progressive.Nixon starred in the HBO television series from 1998 to 2004 about four women in New York City, playing the part of attorney Miranda Hobbes. The show later led to two feature films.  They are also a Tony Award-winning stage actor.
WASHINGTON: US marshals served a subpoena on Wednesday (May 30) on former Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon to compel them to appear before a US Senate subcommittee on Jun 5 on efforts to protect athletes from abuse, a committee spokesperson said.
Simon, who resigned from Michigan State in January, and Steve Penny from USA Gymnastics were criticised for not doing enough to halt abuse by former doctor Larry Nassar, who was convicted last year of molesting gymnasts and was sentenced to an effective life term in prison.

A lawyer for Penny, who resigned in March 2017, accepted a subpoena on their behalf, said spokesperson Frederick Hill of the Senate Commerce panel that has been investigating abuse of athletes. Simon was served with a subpoena in Traverse City, Michigan, Hill said.
A lawyer for Simon, Mayer Morganroth, did not respond to a request for comment. But they told the Detroit Free Press that Simon had been on vacation in Traverse City and would appear at the hearing. "There is not much they can say," they told the newspaper. "They know that. They didn't have any direct contact at all with Nassar."
Witnesses can assert the right not to answer questions if they fear the answers could be used against them in a potential criminal prosecution.
Simon, who became president in 2005, said in their resignation letter in January that "as tragedies are politicised, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger."

A third former official, Rhonda Faehn, who was the women's program director of USA Gymnastics and was dismissed earlier this month, has also been called and agreed to testify, Hill said.
It was not immediately clear who is representing Penny or Faehn.
Earlier this month, hundreds of women sexually abused by Nassar tentatively agreed to a US$500 million settlement with Michigan State University.
Kerry Perry, chief executive of USA Gymnastics since December, apologised last week to hundreds of female athletes sexually abused by Nassar and told a US House of Representatives subcommittee hearing that "those days are over."
Miguel Arteta's “dramedy of manners” will kick off festival on June 1.
Beatriz At Dinner will open the 2017 Sundance Film Festival: London (June 1-4).
The film will be introduced by director Miguel Arteta, screenwriter Mike White and lead actor Salma Hayek at Picturehouse Central on June 1.
Beatriz At Dinner had its world premiere at this year's Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, USA and co-stars alongside John Lithgow, Connie Britton, Chloë Sevigny and Jay Duplass.
Hayek plays Beatriz, a Mexican immigrant in California whose life changes forever when they meet a self-made billionaire at a dinner party.
The full programme for the Sundance Film Festival: London will be announced soon.
The UK offshoot of the Sundance Film Festival, which puts a spotlight on American independent cinema, retains a June berth in 2017 following last year's shift from its previous April slot.
John Cooper, director of the Sundance Film Festival, said: “We look forward to launching our fifth festival in London with Beatriz At Dinner, a masterful dramedy of errors from director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Mike White and starring Salma Hayek. This was a standout at our Utah Festival in January and is a wonderful example of the continued innovation and creativity of our independent filmmakers that we'll showcase in London again this year.”
The 2017 Sundance Film Festival ran from January 19-29 in Utah, USA.

Roaming charges for using mobile phones when travelling within the European Union disappear on Thursday, capping a decade-long battle by Brussels to show increasingly sceptical Europeans it can make their lives better.
BRUSSELS: Roaming charges for using mobile phones when travelling within the European Union disappear on Thursday, capping a decade-long battle by Brussels to show increasingly sceptical Europeans it can make their lives better.
Yet for all the excitement it is generating within European Union institutions, opt-outs secured by major telecoms firms and member states' refusal to give up their lucrative national airwaves may leave many holidaymakers disappointed this summer - and facing higher bills at home.
Ending the practice of adding hefty charges to surf the internet, call or send texts when abroad within the EU has been a cause celebre for the European Commission and Parliament which saw it as an affront to common market ideals.
"The European Union is about bringing people together and making their lives easier. The end of roaming charges is a true European success story," the institutions said on Wednesday.
The Commission draped a victory banner down its Berlaymont headquarters reading "Goodbye roaming fees".

The change in legislation finally passed several months ago was certainly welcomed by some visitors to Brussels.
"I think it's excellent," said Charlie Wild, a musician from Scotland. "I've been in Europe for two weeks spending three pounds (US$3.80) a day to be able to use my phone, and tomorrow I don't have to, and it's great."
Julie DuBlanc, visiting from France for work, said, "We'll be checking our phones more often, as we would in Paris."
But they may need to be careful. The project has faced numerous setbacks as mobile phone operators have lobbied to maintain what has been a significant source of revenue while the realities of a fragmented telecoms market have confounded politicians' efforts to do away with the charges.
The snag was that while customers can no longer by law be asked to pay extra when using phones abroad, operators still face wholesale fees from the foreign networks that connect them.
A solution which involves capping wholesale charges has proved fiendishly complex since it means setting a cap that suits companies in all 28 member states, even though domestic mobile rates vary hugely.
NORTH VS SOUTH
In northern Europe countries, which are effectively net exporters of tourists, there is concern that high wholesale fees being paid to networks in southern holiday destinations, combined with the loss of roaming revenue, could force firms to stop letting customers use their phones abroad at all.
Alternatively, the companies in the north could raise charges at home to offset the losses, effectively forcing poorer, stay-at-home customers to subsidise travellers.
In the tourist-magnet south, governments argued that low wholesale charges would hurt their local phone operators which play host to visitors, and force them to jack up rates for customers at home as well.
The compromise struck pleased the larger operators but smaller firms said the wholesale roaming caps were still too high, and the effects are beginning to ripple out.
"The regulated wholesale cost still remains relatively high comparative to usage," said Phillip Malloch, vice-president and head of group public affairs at Swedish operator Telia.
As a result, Telia will stop offering roaming as part of its Swedish data-only mobile broadband price plans, Malloch said.
Operators in Scandinavia and the Baltics, including Telia in Estonia and Lithuania, have also applied for exemptions from the obligation to stop levying roaming charge - something EU rules allow if the companies face at least a 3 percent revenue hit.
Some in the business were not impressed by the loopholes.
"It's a real shame and disappointment that the incumbent operators, who fought against lower roaming charges so hard, are now abusing the system to over-charge their customers," said an executive at a virtual network operator, or a company that offers network services using the networks of other providers.
Credit Suisse analysts estimated in April that the introduction of roam-like-at-home was leading to increases in base tariffs to offset the lost revenue, which is expected to be between 2 percent and 5 percent across Europe.
However, Malloch at Telia said it was too early to say who would be the winners and losers, as the end of roaming was likely to lead to higher data consumption as people lounging on the beach stop holding back from sharing their holiday snaps.
"It definitely carries some opportunity also," Malloch said.

LISBON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court dismissed on Wednesday an appeal by Goldman Sachs for compensation from Portugal's Novo Banco over a $835 million loan to Novo Banco's bankrupt predecessor, Banco Espirito Santo (BES), which was carved up by the state in 2014.
The decision, announced by the court on its website, sets a precedent that could help Portugal fend off other lawsuits involving major bondholders in BES, such as Pimco and Blackrock, which have challenged similar decisions by the Portuguese central bank in 2015 not to transfer liabilities to Novo Banco.
The loan arranged by Goldman Sachs was extended to BES by Luxembourg-based vehicle Oak Finance in 2014, shortly before the bank went bankrupt under the weight of the debts of its founding family, and Goldman has sought compensation from Novo Banco, which took over the healthy operations of BES.
Britain's Supreme Court said it unanimously rejected the appeal, even though the original loan agreement was governed by English law. Novo Banco declined to comment.
After the collapse of BES in August 2014, Portugal's central bank transferred some assets and liabilities to Novo Banco, which took over BES operations after an injection of about 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of public funds. It was acquired last year by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star.
In December 2014, the central bank specified the Goldman Sachs loan was not eligible for the transfer and had never been transferred, to which Goldman objected.
The court said it understood "that an English court must treat the Oak liability as never having been transferred to Novo Banco. It was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause."
It added there were ongoing administrative law proceedings in Portugal challenging the December 2014 decision, which have not yet been resolved.
A range of other lawsuits by bondholders in BES and Novo Banco also challenge a central bank decision at the end of 2015 to transfer more than 2 billion euros of bonds from the rescued Novo Bank back to BES, which is being liquidated.
London-based hedge fund Winterbrook Capital said last week it considered several notes issued by Novo Banco to be in default as a result of the resolution measures taken by Portugal's central bank in 2014 and 2015.
Despite the warning, Novo Banco placed 400 million euros worth of subordinated debt notes just two days later on June 29, its first issue since the rescue, to strong investor demand.

Dynamite Entertainment has announced something pretty groovy, as they're going to be making an Army Of Darkness board game. The news comes not long after Ash vs. Evil Dead was canceled by Starz, leaving a void to be filled. While we're sure to hear news of other on-screen projects in the future, this new tabletop game may very well help many fans fill the hole in their heart. Here's what Dynamite CEO Nick Barrucci had to say about it.
"Army of Darkness was the first license we signed at Dynamite and it still holds a very special place in our heart. So we couldn't think of a better, more exciting brand to use for our first miniatures game. We can't wait to show tabletop gamers and horror fans what we have planned!"
In Army of Darkness: The Board Game, players will take on the role of unlikely hero Ash Williams, the chainsaw-wielding, time traveling S-Mart employee. In this multiplayer game, Ash and their allies will lead an army of medieval knights against a horde of unliving Deadite zombies. Lynnvander Studios, who previously worked with Dynamite on their Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Re-Animator board games are working on this new game. The game will come with some very detailed mini figures and other miniatures that can be supplemented with expansions and other accessories.
This new Army of Darkness game has nothing to do with the Evil Dead 2 board game, which was funded on Kickstarter in 2016. The makers of that game, Space Goat, purchased a license but unfortunately ran out of money and haven't been able to fulfill products for their backers. So this Army of Darkness game may serve as a bit of solace for those who have been waiting on that game to actually arrive. As Nick Barrucci explains, Army of Darkness and Evil Dead are owned by different studios and Dynamite has held the license for the former for quite some time.
"The IP holder for Army of Darkness and the IP holder for Evil Dead are two entirely different rights holders who have nothing to do with each other. The Army of Darkness movie is owned by MGM and I'm not certain who owns the Evil Dead franchise. We've produced Army of Darkness comics and merchandise for 14 years. Yes, Ash is in both, but different rights holders for each franchise. And Space Goat and Dynamite are two entirely different companies."
Bruce Campbell, unfortunately, retired as Ash Williams in the wake of Ash Vs. Evil Dead getting the ax, but they recently teased that there are going to be new incarnations of the franchise heading our way. It may not be a movie, but this board game is a great place to start. Currently, there is no word on when the game may be released, but you can check out some early artwork (which isn't finalized) for Army of Darkness: The Board Game for yourself below, courtesy of Dynamite.
Last week it was announced that the Hellboy reboot will simply be called Hellboy, and not Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen as previously reported. Today, we have even more details about the script, including some new and returning characters that will be featured in this thrilling adventure. Comic book creator Mike Mignola recently teased that this reboot will include the Bureau of Paranorman Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.), and today we have more details about where the B.P.R.D. will be setting up shop, along with news of never-before-seen characters from the comics, along with a few that were featured in the first two Hellboy movies. There will be potential SPOILERS below, so read on at your own risk.
One of Splash Report's sources reveals that the B.P.R.D. headquarters will be located, "on a snow-capped mountainside," although no specific location details were given. Inside the B.P.R.D. fans will get to see, "cryptid skeletons, freakish things encased in formaldehyde, period weapons," along with "the symbol of a hand holding a sword, with the words: IN ABSENTIA LUCI, TENEBRAE VINCIUNT," the Latin motto of the B.P.R.D. which translates to "In the absence of light, darkness conquers." This report also reveals who the members of this organization will be in the reboot.
Alongside David Harbour's Hellboy, the B.P.R.D. will also include Abe Sapien, played by Doug Jones in the original movies, along with characters who haven't been featured in the movie before, such as Alice Monaghan, who can "hear dead people" and will also be using the "Spirit Wrack," and Major Ben Daimio, described as a "rugged military type with cold, calculating eyes, close-cropped hair and three jagged scars raked across their grizzled face." This character will also have a "cool transformation" in the movie, which was not disclosed. Other characters that will be featured include the Gruagach, a "fairy creature that looks like a pig and is a vengeful adversary of Hellboy," who blames the title character for their "current state and wants revenge." Others include Babe Yaga the Witch along with King Arthur and Merlin.
This report also confirms that this project will in fact be an R-rated reboot, which we've heard several times in the past, with the plot said to be a "darker horror story" instead of lighter, more comedic stories that have been told in the first two movies. Production will take place in London, with the story also featuring a massive creature with giant tentacles which wraps its limbs around the London Bridge. This report also claims that the story will be left "wide up for a sequel," with the end of the movie showing who Hellboy will be going after next.
This report doesn't shed any light on a report from May, which claimed that the Hellboy reboot starts filming in September. Lionsgate has yet to set a release date, and the studio is still in casting mode, with Ian McShane recently coming aboard to play Professor Broom, with Milla Jovovich taking on a rare villainous role as the infamous Blood Queen. It isn't reported when we may have casting news about the other characters mentioned in this report, but if filming on this Hellboy reboot will in fact begin next month, we could hear more about this project sooner than later.
The BC Lions crashed an aquafit class in Kamloops this week
If you like their moves on the field you'll be delighted with what they bring to the pool.
The BC Lions held their annual training camp in Kamloops this past week, but what was different about this year was an impromptu team workout session.
The football players piled into the pool at the Canadian Games Aquatic Centre for a little aquafit workout.
Several members of the Lions were filmed splashing about after taking a break from their training at Hillside Stadium.
Players also invited members of the public to attend their club's 2018 FanFest, last weekend, where those big and small had a chance to watch a practice and meet the Lions.
The team will be in Kamloops until June 7 for training.

An American wrestler using Donald Trump's schtick is body-slamming their way to fame in Mexican wrestling.
Sam Adonis - real name Sam Polinsky - has used the anti-Trump feeling in Mexico to their advantage.
And fans love to hate him.
“I hear it all, and the Mexican fans are screaming the worst expletives they can at me. They are throwing beers at me, they are throwing popcorn at me,” the wrestler told Reuters.
Adonis gives fans plenty of ammunition by wearing an American flag cape with Trump's mug emblazoned on it. Wayward beer bottles fired their way aren't unusual.
Like Nikolai Volkoff and the Iron Sheik before him, Adonis is a bad guy - or “rudo” in Mexican wrestling parlance. The good guys are known as “technicos”.
Adonis says the atmosphere is electric.
“Fans in Mexican lucha libre are some of the best on earth. Two thousand people in Mexico can make more noise than 20,000 people in the United States,” they said.
But despite the boos, young fans love him.
Second only to soccer in terms of popularity, lucha libre wrestling, Adonis shifted from pretty boy ladies man to the Trump act as the reality TV star was rising.
Does life imitate art?
“I can't say I support Trump but I definitely respect Trump,” they said. “He is just himself, and if you like it, you like it, and if you don't, you don't.”
Oslo, Norway – December 7, 2017 – Nobel Peace Prize Concert organizers today announced that one of the six existing “Hibaku Pianos,” a remarkable collection of pianos which survived the atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, will make a special appearance at the 24th annual event in Oslo, Norway on December 11th at Telenor Arena, honoring the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.
The Yamaha upright piano, built in 1938, was exposed to the atomic bombing at a private home in Ujina, Minami-ku, Hiroshima City, 3km from the hypocenter. The owner donated the piano to Yagawa Mitsunori, a 66-year-old noted piano tuner/technician of Yagawa Piano Studio, who specializes in restoring pianos that were exposed to the Hiroshima bombing, and is also a second-generation atomic bombing survivor. Mr. Yagawa has restored the piano to be able to be used in performances, while keeping its condition as close as possible to its condition at the time of the bombing. The piano has featured in many concerts throughout Japan, as well as at a series of events in New York in 2010.
“Music has no borders,” said Yagawa Mitsunori, who tours across Japan, playing the piano at peace concerts. “I hope that people hearing the timbre of the Hibaku Piano at this concert will be an opportunity for them to reflect upon the preciousness of peace, and the horror of nuclear weapons.
This piano has experienced the tragedy of the atomic bombings. Therefore, there is a message which only it can convey. As a second generation Hibakusha (atomic bomb survivor) in Hiroshima, and as a piano tuner, continuing this is my life's mission.”
“We are privileged to be able to present one of the Hibaku Pianos at this year's Nobel Peace Prize Concert,” said the concert´s producers Odd Arvid Strømstad and Kristian Kirkvaag. “Yagawa Mitsunori's lifelong dedication to preserving the pianos that survived the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and spreading a message of peace is singular, and we're honored to share their life's work at the Concert.”
Internationally acclaimed actor, producer and activist David Oyelowo will host the 24th Annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert with headliner John Legend, Danish band Lukas Graham, Swedish singer/songwriter Zara Larsson, Norwegian DJ/producer Matoma, Norwegian singer/songwriter Sigrid, and youth performance company Le PeTiT CiRqUe®

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned that an attack by North Korea against the United States could quickly escalate into war, and said the military would try to shoot down any missile that threatened Guam.North Korea last week said it was drawing up plans to test-fire four missiles that would fly toward Guam but splash into the sea before hitting the small US Pacific island territory, after President Donald Trump promised to meet ongoing threats from Pyongyang with "fire and fury.""If they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly," Mattis told Pentagon reporters yesterday.Mattis's comments came after they and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said America has "no interest" in regime change in Pyongyang or the accelerated reunification of the two Koreas, and stressed the importance of a diplomatic solution to the crisis.The defense chief said the Pentagon is able to tell "within moments" where North Korea's missiles are headed, and said the United States would try to shoot down anything that threatened America."We will defend the country from any attack at any time from any quarter," they said.If North Korea fires missiles deemed to be a threat to Guam, "then it's game on, and we will try and do our best to make sure it does not hit the United States," Mattis said.When asked if they would order the shoot-down of missiles headed toward Guam -- but which would fall short of actually hitting the island -- Mattis said they did not want to signal whether the United States would still try to stop them."If it falls short of Guam, then it becomes an issue that we take up however the president chooses," Mattis said."I need a certain amount of ambiguity on this because I am not going to tell them what I'll do in each case.

SINGAPORE: Singapore has appointed 40-year-old Murat Özyeğin as its Honorary Consul-General in Istanbul, Turkey.
The role will have jurisdiction over Istanbul and Izmir, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a media statement on Monday (Jan 2).
It will also support the work of the Singapore Embassy in Ankara, headed by Ambassador A Selverajah.
According to MFA, Mr Özyeğin is the Head of Strategic Planning and Business Development of Fiba Group, a company which controls the investment portfolio of brand names in both financial and non-financial sectors.
 They are an executive board member of FINA and FIBA Holding, and Chairman of all of Fiba Group's non-banking businesses.
 They are also a Board Member of the Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen Association, Hüsnü M. Özyeğin Foundation, Endeavor Turkey and World Wildlife Fund Turkey, and Chairman of the Turkish-Dutch Business Association.
MFA said: "This appointment will further enhance Singapore's bilateral ties with Turkey which have been strengthened in recent years by the signing of the Joint Declaration on a Strategic Partnership in October 2014 and the Turkey-Singapore Free Trade Agreement in November 2015."
As Honorary Consul-General, Mr Özyeğin will perform representational duties and notarial functions, as well as extend consular assistance to Singaporeans.
The address of the Singapore Consulate-General in Istanbul is as follows:
Growing up, Dr. Read Hayes saw their father and grandfather, both physicians, study the human body and how disease affects it. They read their medical journals with interest in the science behind medicine.
Today, Dr. Hayes, who has a doctorate in criminology, is a scientist who studies criminals, loss prevention and shoplifting. As co-director of the Loss Prevention Research Team at the University of Florida, they have spent their entire career in loss prevention and retail security.
Theft and fraud cost U.S. retailers billions in annual losses, as well as generating violence, demonstrating human decision-making gone bad. University of Florida scientists with Dr. Hayes are working with more than 75 technologies in their Innovation Lab in Gainesville, Florida, as well as in more than 20 stores in that city to refine ways to deter crime attempts in a variety of environments.
Dr. Hayes and their team have help from more retailers including Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Home Depot, CVS, Walgreens, Bloomingdales, Best Buy, AutoZone, Verizon, T-Mobile, Toys R Us and
TJ Maxx, who work together via 11 working groups to tackle in-store, parking lot, supply chain and online crime and loss problems.
With the blessing of both the penetration tester “criminals” and the store staff, the researchers watch thieves as they decide what, how and if to steal, though the shoplifters stop short of actually leaving with the goods.
Dr. Hayes and their team also study crime prevention begins before customers even enter the store: they and their colleagues evaluate security cameras that can report the license plate of a car parked in front of a store that might be poised for a getaway, as well as facial recognition technology so sophisticated that it can detect the age, gender, even mood of a would-be criminal. Another camera can recognize known offenders and alert staff to their presence.
Why do you believe in learning the science of shoplifting?
I look at it like a physician studies medicine. When you try to prevent heart attacks, you look at how much a role is played by diet, exercise, stress. You have to understand how the disease works to design the cure and evaluate how the cure is working. We apply the same principles to understanding how bad guy stuff works and how our tools work.
I was a security practitioner for many years, starting as a store detective, then a loss prevention manager. The more I studied shoplifting, the more I realized that it can have very serious outcomes, including life safety. Working as a part-time store detective early in my career, I was watching the sales floor from the stockroom above when I noticed a woman taking clothes off their hangers and giving them to an accomplice, who put them in their bag while a third person acted as a lookout. I called my manager, and we approached the three of them. One by one, they started resisting, then attacking. An off-duty deputy sheriff ran over, and they started fighting us. By the end, about six police officers were involved. One of the offenders was a big, powerfully built guy who was able to throw people around, and who managed to kick out the side window out of patrol car.
What are you studying in your Innovation Lab?
We have adopted a medical model in our research, looking at retail crime the way doctors look at disease. And we look at many things, such as the height of the shelves to the placement of the cash registers and how they influence criminal decision-making. We test innovations in theft prevention, watching how customers and criminals react. Just as interesting to us are the deterrents that criminals don't notice, such as security cameras. A good deterrent makes a would-be criminal reconsider, but isn't so intrusive that it makes paying customers feel uncomfortable
Crime control techniques are designed to make theft seem too risky, too difficult, or not worth it to would-be thieves. After these tactics are developed or enhanced, active criminal offenders are exposed to these “treatments,” and many are evaluated in dozens of stores using medical style field experiments known as randomized controlled trials.
You also have three basic approaches to theft…
It's called “See – Get – Fear”. Criminals have to first see the deterrent, understand what it does, and fear that it will work well enough to land them in jail. So we get real-world insight from active offenders, who tell us not only into what they see, get and fear, but why they steal particular items. Razor blades, Tide laundry detergent, Crest Whitestrips, baby formula and the heartburn medication Prilosec are favorite targets worldwide. These items check many of the boxes defined by researchers as desirable to thieves: They're easy to carry and hide, available in a wide variety of stores, expensive to purchase and simple to resell. We try to understand how many thieves discount and assess personal risk. It's fascinating to understand how criminals will grossly underestimate the risk.

Reality is that we have had fantastic press freedom in Kenya .
Sadly the same media have gone overboard. The stuff we see and read puts to shame even the west who we try to emulate .
Even now with the 3 Key TV stations shutdown they are still streaming online. The net has NOT been affected in any way nor social media, all papers are running normaly including radio stations so in essence we can't say it's a crackdown.
When we loosely use words like Dictatorship, do we really know what that means ? Ethiopia and Rwanda rising African nations or even Egypt will not entertain an iota of what we go through here.
Media is supposed to stand for the truth without any fear or favour but we have senior key journalists who have openly taken sides . Let's face it , watching or listening to some of the journalists you wonder how on earth will they be fair ? Their personal social media handles or pages are even worse. If these journalists truly feel that they want to actively take part in politics then leave the media house. You cannot choose to eat your cake at the same time have it.
Opposition does not mean you say anything you wish and you dont expect to be held to account . Day in day out you keep daring the Goverment of the day .That is total abuse of so-called freedom. Granted main media has not dubbed in such extremes but they ain't innocent either.
Finally how many of us truly truly miss the TV Stations ? Self styled analysts where majority would always be driven by tribal card and where their bread is buttered.
Media Kenya must seriously reflect on way forward and this shutdown period should be period for them to review what is right and what is wrong . They should consider this a sabbatical and reflect hard.
As a Rotarians I urge Media Kenya to reflect on our Four Way Test:
The 4-Way Test of the things we think, say or do:
1. Is it the TRUTH?
2. Is it FAIR to all concerned?
3. Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?
4. Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?
Sadly the biased journalists have completely failed Test No 2. I hope and trust that these few days of these TV stations shutdown they will use the time to seriously reflect on the future.
There is a huge difference of running a mainstream media channel right in the heart of a capital city as opposed to some guerrilla owned TV station broadcasting from some safe haven.
I leave you with the wise words of Lee Kuan Yew when they said ” Singapore needs a press that is free as is needed to Serve Singapore” well the same should apply to Kenya as we also demand for non partisan media and as always I choose to remain an optimist.

ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — A man diagnosed with schizophrenia who says they were forcibly injected by a health worker in the back of a car is suing Newfoundland's largest health authority.
Marc Arsenault says the forced injection last January is one of many times Eastern Health violated their Charter rights.
They said two Eastern Health workers arrived at their St. John's home, asking if they wanted their monthly shot.
“They were taking me out to McDonald's to have a coffee,” Arsenault said in an interview.
Arsenault has been under various community treatment orders (CTOs) since Aug. 2, 2013, including “the compulsory injection of mind-altering medications,” says the statement of claim. CTOs force patients to accept treatment or face arrest.
Arsenault said they were not under a CTO at the time that forces injections. But they said they kept asking if he'd take it voluntarily.
“They kept on manipulating me, mentally abusing me,” they said.
They stopped at a church while they rode with them to McDonald's, and “they injected me right in the parking lot there, in the back seat of the car.”
Arsenault, 59, is seeking unspecified compensation from Eastern Health for negligence, unlawful detainment and battery. The health authority has not filed a statement of defence in response to the unproven allegations.
Arsenault's lawyer, Ches Crosbie, said the incident is “simply intolerable.”
“It just illustrates the cavalier approach that Eastern Health seems to be taking toward observing the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens.”
CTOs are designed for psychiatric patients who are otherwise in and out of hospital.
Families and mental-health officials say they offer a lifeline in the most desperate situations when psychosis takes over. But they are also among the most coercive medical interventions, criticized as abuse-prone tools of control.
CTOs are governed by legal safeguards to protect Charter rights and have raised concerns in other parts of Canada, especially Ontario, where orders have drastically increased in recent years.
Eastern Health declined to specifically comment on Arsenault's lawsuit and has not yet filed a defence.
“Eastern Health takes any concerns regarding community treatment orders very seriously and has taken steps to ensure they are administered as per provincial legislation,” said an emailed statement.
The provincial government last March announced it had discovered 13 recent cases where patients subject to CTOs “did not receive advice from rights advisers as required by law.”
“This is a very serious issue and the regional health authorities are in the process of contacting all those affected to ensure rights are protected and treatment is not disrupted,” Health Minister John Haggie said at the time.
They also apologized and said two rights advisers were fired.
The health department said it would improve how community treatment orders are issued and monitored.
As of mid-December, there were 13 CTOs in effect across the province.
Crosbie said their client's case is especially troubling because alleged oversight gaffes and rights violations continued even after a judge admonished them.
Judge William Goodridge ruled in September 2015 that a community treatment order against Arsenault was invalid in part because the psychiatrist did not provide supporting facts that they met required criteria.
Goodridge wrote that legal protections to shield vulnerable residents from “significant state intervention in the context of no criminal activity” must be upheld.
“There is no option for non-compliance or partial compliance with these provisions.”
Still, oversight lapses continued, Crosbie alleges.
“Either Eastern Health takes these seriously and follows the procedures that are established before people are compulsorily treated, or they don't,” they said.
“If it's necessary to seek punitive damages to make them pay attention, then that's what my client will do.”
Arsenault said they were asked in mid-December if they wanted another injection but said no. They will meet again with health workers in January.
Soft spoken and cheerful, they blamed the shots for weight gain, tremors and skin sores.
Arsenault said he's not convinced they were properly diagnosed with schizophrenia.
“My hope is to stop the abuse and the injections,” they said of the lawsuit.
“I want it stopped.”
You're already backing up apps and documents with Google Drive, so why not backup everything else, too?
Beginning June 28, you'll be able to back up all of your files and folders from a Mac or PC to your Google Drive. It's called, very simply, Backup and Sync, and once installed, it will help you keep things in check even when you're not checking them.
From the official blog post:
On June 28th, 2017, we will launch Backup and Sync from Google, a tool intended to help everyday users back up files and photos from their computers, so they're safe and accessible from anywhere. Backup and Sync is the latest version of Google Drive for Mac/PC, which is now integrated with the Google Photos desktop uploader. As such, it will respect any current Drive for Mac/PC settings in the Admin console.
Since its inception, Google Drive has required that you manually sync any data stored on your main computer, or move files and folders so that they're saved directly to the cloud account. But once the new app goes live, you'll be able to choose which files and folders to stay synced. It'll also be integrated with the current Google Photos Backup tool for Mac and PC.
On the mobile side, this means you'll have access to those files and folders from any tablet or smartphone that has access to Google Drive. It also means you won't have to two different desktop apps installed to keep Photos and Drive synced at the same time.
Google suggests that if you're planning to use the backup feature for your work-related G Suite account, you should use the Drive File System instead because it allows for larger data uploads. Also, not all G Suite users will automatically be upgraded to the ability — managers of the G Suite account will need to turn on the option for employees to utilize the backup feature for them to get access to Backup and Sync.
Jordin Sparks has a new man.
The “American Idol” winner and their beau, Dana Isaiah, made their first public appearance as a couple at the Harold & Carole Pump Foundation Gala on Friday.
Sparks, 27, and model Isaiah, 25, have been getting cozy since this spring, but only made it Instagram official when they posted a sweet snap of them together at Disneyland with the caption “Mine” on June 25.
The pair is proof that the couple that sweats together stays, as Isaiah's Instagram feed is full of photos and videos of themselves and Sparks at the gym.
A post shared by Dana Isaiah (@_danaisaiah) on Jul 3, 2017 at 8:46am PDT
Sparks famously dated Jason Derulo for three years before splitting up in 2014. Talking with People, the songstress says they gave them self 21 days to get over Derulo. What made their breakup even more devastating was that Sparks nursed Derulo back to health after they broke their neck in January 2012.
Sparks also briefly dated rapper Sage the Gemini following their breakup.
Revenge thriller “Ruin” has led the 2017 version of the Black List — an annual ranking of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.
The project is set up at Marc Butan's Mad River Pictures. The script is written by the team of Matthew and Ryan Firpo and centers on an ex-Nazi captain in post-World War II Germany. They seek atonement for their crimes by tracking down the surviving members of their former SS Death Squad.
“Ruin” received 68 votes from among the more than 250 executives voting. Mario Correa's “Let Them Speak” was the second-highest on the list with 42 votes. That project centers on Senator Wendy Davis and their 24-hour filibuster to save 75% of abortion clinics in Texas. Sandra Bullock is attached to star.
Christy Hall's “Daddio,” which Daisy Ridley is attached to star in, received 40 votes. The script is the story of a passenger and their cab driver who reminisce about their relationships on the way from the airport to their apartment in New York.
Samuel Franco and Evan Kilgore's screenplay “Keeper of the Diary” came in fourth with 32 votes. It's a chronicle of Otto Frank's journey, with the help of a junior editor at Doubleday Press, to find a publisher for the diary their daughter Anne wrote during the Holocaust.

Last year's Black List was led by Elyse Hollander's “Blond Ambition” screenplay about Madonna's first album. Three projects tied for second place with 35 votes each: Dan Fogelman's multi-generational story “Life Itself”; Tony Tost's “The Olympian,” about an underdog rower trying to compete at the 1984 Olympics; and Liz Hannah's “The Post,” about how Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham and editor Ben Bradlee overcame their differences to publish the story about the Pentagon Papers.
“The Post,” starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, is directed by Steven Spielberg. It opens on Dec. 22 and scored multiple Golden Globe nominations Monday morning.
A total of 76 scripts made the list this year, including Ben Jacoby's “Newsflash.” Producers announced Monday that Seth Rogen will play legendary anchor Walter Cronkite in “Newsflash,” centered on CBS' coverage of the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. David Gordon Green is directing the drama. Former Warner Bros. production president Greg Silverman is producing through their Stampede Ventures, along with Adam Kolbrenner of Madhouse Entertainment.
“Newsflash” received 15 votes. The rest of the top vote-getters on list, which is on the Black List web site:

“When Lightning Strikes” by Anna Klassen; 20 votes.
“Breaking News in Yuba County” by Amanda Idoko; 19 votes.
“Sleep Well Tonight” by Freddie Skov; 18 votes.
“The Great Nothing” by Cesar Vitale; 17 votes.

“When in Doubt, Seduce” by Allie Hagan; 16 votes.
NORRISTOWN: Bill Cosby's lawyers on Tuesday (Apr 24) urged a US jury to acquit the disgraced star of alleged sexual assault and save them from "ruin," savaging the case against them in the first celebrity trial of the #MeToo era.
The frail 80-year-old could spend the rest of their life behind bars if convicted of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand, then a Temple University employee, in January 2004.
Wearing an orange embroidered coat and sunglasses, Camille, Cosby's wife of more than half a century, on Tuesday made their first appearance at their retrial, embracing them tenderly and beaming before taking a seat.
"Mr Cosby must be acquitted of all counts. They must walk out of here free," said defence lawyer Tom Mesereau. "He's a distinguished man. They made some mistakes for sure but they are no criminal."
The case has trashed the legacy of the actor once adored by millions as "America's Dad" for their role as lovable father and obstetrician Cliff Huxtable on the 1984-92 hit television series "The Cosby Show."
The defence brands 45-year-old Constand a "con artist" who pursued a lonely, grieving father and falsely accused the star to bag a US$3.38 million civil settlement in 2006 to escape debt.

Prosecutors in Montgomery County brought five other women to testify that Cosby was a serial rapist and predator who preyed on much younger women who looked up to them by drugging and assaulting them.
Cosby claims they gave the Canadian an over-the-counter antihistamine to relieve stress and that relations were consensual.
'PATHOLOGICAL LIAR'
Constand says Cosby drugged and assaulted them after they went to their mansion to ask for advice about quitting their job as director of operations for the women's basketball team.
"You're dealing with a pathological liar, members of the jury, you are," said Mesereau, calling it "very, very serious" that an 80-year-old man was "looking at absolute ruin. Absolute ruin."
"They're not inconsistencies, they're lies," said Mesereau, calling the 2006 civil settlement "one of the biggest highway robberies of all time."
In a case with no physical evidence, which essentially boils down to she-said, he-said, Mesereau drilled into the detail of inconsistencies in Constand's testimony to police and in sworn statements.
Cosby's first trial in Norristown, a Philadelphia suburb, ended in a hung jury in June, with a sequestered panel hopelessly deadlocked after six days of testimony and 52 hours of deliberations.
This time they have more testimony to consider.
Last time the defence brought just one witness. This time the defence star witness is a former Temple University employee who claimed that Constand spoke of wanting to set up a celebrity for cash.
They have presented phone and travel records to suggest that Cosby was not in Philadelphia to carry out the alleged assault in January 2004.
'NOT SNOWFLAKES'
They brought an expert who said Constand's side-effects were consistent with neither the over-the-counter antihistamine nor Quaaludes, a 1970s party drug that Cosby admitted during a 2006 deposition that they had obtained with a view to having sex.
"If they can't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, our highest legal standard, the case is over," said Mesereau, ending a two-hour closing argument begun by former federal prosecutor Kathleen Bliss.
Bliss besmirched Constand as "not a good girl," who fooled around with "a married man old enough to be their grandfather" and delivered a stinging attack on the five accusers as fame-hungry opportunists.
In an astonishing personal assault on the most famous of the five, Bliss called Janice Dickinson an "aged-out model" who "sounds as though she's slept with every single guy on the planet."
The defence also sought to neuter any influence that the cultural watershed of the #MeToo movement may exert on jurors.
"Mob rule is not due process," said Bliss. "Just like sexual assault, the denigration of women is real," they added. But women are "not snowflakes. We're not like delicate flowers."
"As men and women we reject gossip and speculation and false promises," they said. "That's what makes for due process ... Never ever let anyone or anything shame you into a conviction."
Prosecutors initially declined to prosecute the case, but reopened it in 2015, arguing new evidence had come to light, while an avalanche of women came forward publicly to accuse the star of decades of assault.
They will deliver their closing arguments later on Tuesday before the case goes to the jury.
Turnover of Azerbaijani securities market almost triples
2018-04-24 18:44 | www.trend.az | 2
Baku, Azerbaijan, April 24
By Anvar Mammadov – Trend:
The turnover of securities has amounted to 6.19 billion manats in Azerbaijan in the first quarter of 2018, which is by 2.7 times more than the same period of 2017, Azerbaijan's Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FIMSA) said on April 24.
The turnover in the state securities market increased by 9.2 times, while turnover in the secondary corporate securities market decreased by 22 percent.
For everyone holding their breath since the last episode—Jaime is alive. Bronn, the sellsword with a heart of gold somehow manages to fish out the army commander with a hand of gold (and a full armour) from the lake, swim across and save their lives, proving once again that no matter on what team, Bronn is the real MVP.
On the other, smoky, soot-covered side of the water, Tyrion walks across the ravaged fields in the wake of Daenerys' aftermath, not looking too happy given the unequivocal win for their team. Is it because they see people who were their kin not too long ago burnt to a crisp, or is they a tiny bit queasy at a teaser of how a war involving three dragons, a horde of bloodthirsty Dothraki warriors and two power-hungry queens will turn out? What follows—Dany's live roast of two-thirds of the Tarly men, despite their advising, near-begging the Mother of Dragons otherwise—does not seem to put their fears to rest. #ByeDickon #GoneTooSoon
Back in Dragonstone, Varys offers words to Tyrion's fears, counselling them to find a way to control Daenerys. Neither seems too happy about Dany's Mad Queen avatar, especially Varys, having experienced the Targaryen madness first hand as part of Mad King Aerys' small council.
Speaking of mad queens, things are not looking up for Cersei. Them army is destroyed, they just found out their son was murdered not by their delinquent brother Tyrion but by the scheming Queen of Thorns Olenna Tyrell, and they will never have the satisfaction of giving them a painful death. To top it all, Jaime is meeting said delinquent brother (who still murdered their father, if not Joffrey) behind them back, but like Cersei says, nothing happens in King's Landing without them knowing of it. They will accept the Dragon Queen's invitation for an armistice, yes, but Tywin's daughter knows a thing or two about pausing only to strike at the right moment. Which is what they do to Jaime. Poor Jaime. The twincest has resulted in yet another baby—or so Cersei has their brother/lover believe. They probably know this one will die too, what with the prophecy claiming all three of their other children, but that won't stop them from using their pregnancy to manipulate Jaime squarely on to their side, right when they may have started to question them sanity.
Ser Jorah comes back from their self-imposed exile, interrupting Jon just when they were about to explain to Daenerys the awkward bit about coming back to life after being stabbed multiple times. In their weekly ‘Way Forward' meetings, Jon comes up with a brilliant (read: extremely stupid) suicide mission beyond the Wall for themselves and a few others—at least we know that the next episode is going to be a nail biter.
Gendry is also back (at last!) and in a cheeky nod by the showrunners to all the memes after season three, Davos greets them saying, “Thought you might still be rowing.” Gendry is not much of a swordsman—the Baratheon bastard prefers the warhammer, just like their father.
At Winterfell, Arya thinks Sansa only wants power and isn't supporting Jon like they should. Sansa thinks that Arya is homicidal and tactless. Littlefinger is making most of the sibling rivalry, trying to put a wedge in them to further their own interests. Bran shows off their cool warging skills by controlling ravens for an arial visual of where the white walkers are at.
And finally—we have another hint of Jon Snow's parentage. And it's not Sam, poring through and rewriting old maesters' dusty records (much to their frustration), who finds it. It's Gilly, who among bits of useless trivia about the number of windows in the Sept of Baelor and the steps in the Citadel, reads out about the annulment of marriage of a Prince “Rhager”, followed by a secret wedding to another woman in Dorne. While Samwell dismissed Gilly and launched into a little work rant before absconding, scrolls, Gilly and baby in tow, we were just casually left with a piece of Very Important Information. What, we wonder, could they possibly be talking about? (WE KNOW.)
Why watch: Although this episode wasn't an action-packed one like the last, the plot is getting thicker by the minute—literally—with the showrunners trying to cram in every little bit into the last few episodes of the season. Tensions are brewing high in Winterfell with Littlefinger stirring the pot, seasoning it with their trademark Baelish slime. And that moment with Drogon up close as they lean in to kiss Jon (LOL, JK)? That is the kind of CGI budget most commercial movies dream of.
What to skip: Will Arya and Sansa just let go of their ridiculous adolescent resentment against each other? Someone makes them stand in a corner till they sort it out (calling Jon Snow). Then there are the maesters who continue to act like the old fogeys they are, frustrating Samwell to the extent that they miss out on a piece of Very Important Information.
Thoughts: Dany, Jorah and Jon's love triangle is as weird as they come. Will Daenerys choose their nephew or a man 30 years their senior? Also, we're secretly glad that Ghost is nowhere in sight, because after the scene with the huge arrow-weapon and Drogon, we can't stand the thought of another direwolf dying.
Death count: Two very well-done Tarlys courtesy Drogon, and two Lannister soldiers, courtesy Gendry's shiny new warhammer.

African banks are increasingly keen on working with fintech startups, even if we are unlikely to see many acquisitions.
Yet what benefits are there for startups in such arrangements? Simply put, the answer is scale, with banks able to provide the infrastructure, capital and access to markets even the most innovative fintech startups lack.
For Camilla Swart, ecosystem manager at Barclays' Rise innovation hub in Cape Town, the reality for fintechs like the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go on your own. If you want to go far, go together.”
“Sometimes the relationship can take a while with all the layers of approvals and processes but what the dynamic definitely brings is scale,” they said.
“For startups, partnerships with banks allow them to scale their technology and access the capital they need to grow by gaining access to more customers.”
George Wakaria, vice president of cash management at Citibank in Kenya, agrees.
“Many fintech models require high levels of ramp up on customers or transactions to make the return on investment work. With their regional and global footprint, banks offer fintechs a clear distribution network to get their solutions out to more clients in varied markets,” they said.
Zachariah George, co-founder and chief investment officer of Startupbootcamp Africa, said a major challenge for fintech startups is access to market, clients and distribution channels.
“Economies of scale make it very hard for young fintech companies to stress test their tech savvy solutions with large sample sizes,” they said. “So, partnering with banks through pilots and proof of concept experiments allows fintech companies to validate their product offerings quicker and through the ‘safe haven' of it being done through a perceived ‘trustworthy' banking partner.”
Trust is an important issue here, with Entersekt chief executive officer (CEO) Schalk Nolte saying startups can piggyback on the relationship banks already have with their customers.
“Dealing with payments or financial services by its nature requires trust, and this is not easily or cheaply obtained – trust is not built overnight. Banks have trust and a large customer base which can lead to quick market acquisition or attaining critical mass for the tintech,” they said.
This is a view shared by Swart, who says banks come with brand recognition that can be helpful for building credibility in the market.
“Banks offer support and relationship with the regulator and the bank has expertise in risk management, which is enormously helpful to the fintech. At Rise we even have a risk and compliance officer on hand to help strategise on regulatory frameworks for fintechs,” they said.
Wakaria also points to a bank's regulatory and compliance experience as a major benefit to a startup partner.
“Fintech companies have quickly come to realise how heavily regulated the financial industry is and how costly compliance is. They know that compliance requires expertise and investment and this is something that the banks have experience in,” they said.
George agrees regulatory constraints are another driver to develop partnerships.
“Often fintech companies, particularly those that specialise in digital platforms, may not have the necessary licenses to offer financial services directly. Other fintechs may be too early in their development to request a license. In both cases, they partner with microfinance institutions, banks or others to provide these services,” they said.

It's a testament to a film that it always seems to resonate whenever it's rediscovered, dusted off for special occasions or unwittingly stumbled upon, which makes the special screening of Bill Douglas' epic Comrades all the more tantalising.
The screening, at Studio 74, in the Exeter Phoenix, is to mark the 20th anniversary of the Bill Douglas Cinema Museum, housed in Exeter University's old library. It's hot on the heels (kinda) of the film's Continental renaissance. And it comes with an introduction by the film's script editor and Bill Douglas' buddy Peter Jewell, plus the Bill Douglas cinema museum's curator Phil Wickham.
Clear your afternoon and your mind, because there's so much to get your teeth into and enjoy with the film, the screening and the introduction.
The story of Comrades is based on that of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. They were a group of Dorest farmworkers who were arrested and transported to Australia in 1834 for trying to improve their conditions by forming an early form of trade union. How apt their story appears in a modern society of no-hours contracts and increasing splintering of working experience and protection.
Throughout the film the character of the travelling lanternists appears in many guises, spreading news and entertainment and having a spell-binding magical element in tying things together. This brings in aspects of the history of film and the use of the medium, which is now taking on sinister overtones faced as we are with overwhelming fake news and media manipulation.
But at its heart, and surely the key to Comrades' ultimate appeal, longevity and relevance is that it's a story about people: how the performances and the film capture essential aspects of humanity; how personal stories and artistic vision combine in the power of film.
Let's leave the last words to actor Phil Davis when describing Comrades. It has a political message, they say, but it's not a political film, it's a film about people.
Comrades is at the Studio 74 at the Exeter Phoenix, with a special introduction from Phil Wickham and Peter Jewell on Saturday, April 29 at 2pm.
Here are some jumping off points to whet your appetite and convince you to pop along. Plus you really should make a trip to the Bill Douglas Museum, it's a cornucopia of cinema history, social history and a joyous collection.
First off, here's a link to snippets of a Comrades Q&A with Philip Davis and Phil Wickham at the BFI, and below are some fascinating short documentary pieces on the film.

The man charged with killing 17 people at Florida high school qualifies to have a public defender represent them at taxpayer expense, even though they may inherit money from their late mother's estate, a Florida judge ruled on Tuesday.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.: The man charged with killing 17 people at Florida high school qualifies to have a public defender represent them at taxpayer expense, even though they may inherit money from their late mother's estate, a Florida judge ruled on Tuesday.
The 19-year-old suspect, Nikolas Cruz, has a current net worth of about US$28,000 and access to only part of that sum, Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer wrote in a court ruling. As a result, paying for a private lawyer would impose a substantial hardship on the defendant, they said.
The judge said they would reconsider the question of whether Cruz qualified for a public defender should they inherit money from the estate, according to a court filing.
Cruz is accused of using an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle on Feb. 14 to kill 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and wound 17 others. Cruz is a former student at the school in Parkland.
At an April 11 hearing on Cruz's finances, Melissa McNeil of the Broward Public Defender's office told the court that Cruz wanted to donate to charity any money left to them in a trust set up by their mother.
Before the shooting, Cruz told the parents of a schoolmate who took them in after their mother's death that they would inherit US$800,000 when they turn 22. Their mother died in November 2017, according to a report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper. Their father died a few years earlier.

Any money that Cruz inherits would have to be split with their younger brother, Zachary.
Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein also said in an email on Tuesday that the attorney handling the estate has not yet filed to open it for administration.
Prosecutors have signalled their intention to seek the death penalty for Cruz in the massacre, which was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. Their public defence attorneys have said they would plead guilty if prosecutors withdrew the threat of capital punishment, but they have declined to do that.
"We still stand ready to plead guilty to 34 consecutive life sentences without parole," Finkelstein said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday.
"We still believe it is in the best interests of the families and the community to end this case," they wrote.

"The Handmaid's Tale" returns to television this week with its chilling portrait of a near future where women are turned into second-class citizens seeming even darker and more prescient than ever.
LOS ANGELES: "The Handmaid's Tale" returns to television this week with its chilling portrait of a near future where women are turned into second-class citizens seeming even darker and more prescient than ever.
That's not by chance. As the Emmy-winning series moves away from Margaret Atwood's dystopian 1985 novel, it delves further into how the United States moved from democracy into a fictional totalitarian state called Gilead.
Here, pollution has caused widespread infertility, women are forbidden to read, cannot control money, and people spy on each other.
"We began Season 1 feeling we cannot let Margaret Atwood down," said Warren Littlefield, one of the show's executive producers.
"Then right after the (2016 presidential) election, as this pre-Gilead Trump administration unfolded, we felt the responsibility that we can't let down America.
"We are storytellers, but our world that we depict is relevant and the themes are more relevant than ever before," Littlefield added.

Season 2 starts on Wednesday on streaming platform Hulu, resuming immediately where Season 1 ended last June, with the pregnant Offred (Elisabeth Moss) taken away to face punishment for an act of mass rebellion by a group of handmaids in Gilead.
Pre-Gilead flashbacks show the undermining of human and civil rights, where women need their partner's consent to get birth control, are pressured to be stay-at-home mothers, and gay people lose legal protections to face persecution.
It also gives viewers a first, terrifying glimpse of the book's polluted colonies, where infertile or dissident women are sent to live in concentration camp-like conditions.
"There is a lot that we draw upon from the world we are living in," Littlefield said. "The series tried to dramatize some of the human rights issues that we are experiencing in the world and understand, 'How did that happen?'"
Season 1 premiered in April 2017 but production started long before Hillary Clinton lost their bid to become the first woman in the White House and Donald Trump was elected U.S. president.
The TV series, striking for its handmaids dressed in red capes and white face-obscuring bonnets, won awards in its first season.
Canadian author Atwood remains as a consultant and producer as the second season moves beyond their book, which became one of the top 10 best-selling novels of 2017.
"Margaret is probably the biggest cheerleader for go, move, do not fear going past the book," Littlefield said.

Lansing — Gov. Rick Snyder and Republican legislative leaders have agreed to deposit $35 million into a statewide infrastructure fund and $150 million into a “rainy day” savings fund as part of a final budget deal for fiscal year 2018.
The Legislature had cut proposed deposits from Snyder's recommended budget in an attempt to free up $495 million for a teacher pension reform plan, which has since been revised and now is expected to cost significantly less.
The budget deal, which leaders hope to send to the governor's desk next week, is expected to include $55 million to cover two-year upfront costs for teacher pension reforms along with $200 million to pay down debt accrued in the state's legacy pension system.
Additional money will “go back into budget priorities for the administration,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Dave Hildenbrand, R-Lowell.
Snyder's original $56.3 billion budget proposal had recommended a $266.5 million deposit into the rainy day budget stabilization fund and $20 million for the Michigan Infrastructure Fund, which legislators had cut despite fears of another sinkhole or water crisis like those that have occurred in Fraser and Flint, respectively.
Democrats opposed to the pension reform plan had proposed using any identified budget savings for road and bridge repairs.
While the overall spending plan is largely set, Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, acknowledged an ongoing debate with the Snyder administration over “boilerplate” budget language, including a controversial pilot program proposal to integrate behavioral and physical health systems.
Snyder and leaders also still are discussing programs and funding levels in the Department of Corrections budget.
“We're pretty close,” Meekhof said.
Meekhof and House Speaker Tom Leonard, R-DeWitt, froze Snyder out of budget talks last month but invited them back to the table after negotiating the pension reform plan.

President Trump tweeted upon arriving in New York on Monday night, as they prepared to stay overnight there for the first time since they took office.
Trump traveled to Manhattan after a brief visit to the White House, which is undergoing renovations while they vacation at their golf resort in New Jersey.
The native New Yorker said Friday that they had stayed away since January because they realized the impact of the street closings and other aspects of a presidential visit.
"I would love to go to my home in Trump Tower, but it's very, very disruptive to do," they said.
Protesters were awaiting the president's arrival Monday. Trump had taken a firmer stand earlier in the day on the white supremacist violence that wracked Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend.
But for many of the protesters, their remarks were too late, overshadowed by their statement on Saturday that "many sides" were responsible for the Charlottesville violence and their initial failure to name white supremacist groups as aggressors.
BEIJING: China warned on Monday (Aug 14) that nobody would win in a "trade war" with the United States as President Donald Trump prepared to launch an investigation into Chinese intellectual property practices.
Trump was due on Monday to sign a memorandum directing US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether any Chinese laws, policies or practices discriminate against or harm American innovators and technology companies.
The investigation could lead to sanctions against Beijing.
Asked about the US move, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said any member of the World Trade Organisation must respect WTO rules.
"Fighting a trade war has no future. There will be no winner and everybody will lose," Hua said at a regular news briefing.
"I believe China and the US should continue to work together for the stable and sound development of China-US economic and trade relations," they said.

US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, bluntly accused China on Saturday of "stealing our intellectual property" -- long a concern of Western companies seeking a share of the enormous Chinese market.
The looming investigation follows high tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has accused China of failing to rein in the nuclear ambitions of its ally North Korea.
The US officials, however, said the North Korean issue and the investigation into China's trade practices are not linked.
China on Monday announced that it would ban from Tuesday imports of iron, iron ore and seafood from North Korea as it follows through on new UN sanctions approved earlier this month.

"I want to say that China-US cooperation should be based on mutual respect and mutual trust," Hua said. "The Korean peninsula nuclear issue and the China-US trade issue are totally different and it's not appropriate to use one issue as a tool to keep pressure on the other issue."
WHEN a League One side loses at the home of a club who are sitting third in the top flight and en route to the Champions League final, frustration is not supposed to be the over-riding emotion in the away dressing room at the final whistle.
That, though, was how Huddersfield Town felt in the wake of the club's last meeting with Chelsea, an FA Cup fourth-round tie in 2008 that the Londoners won 3-1 thanks to two goals from Frank Lampard.

“It was really strange in the dressing room afterwards,” recalls Matt Glennon, in goal that afternoon. “There was a sense among the players – and (then manager) Andy Ritchie also touched on it – that we could have done better, almost as if we had let ourselves down.
“That sounds daft, considering where we were in the league and the size of Chelsea. Most League One clubs would consider 3-1 a decent result.
“But we had played well and maybe should have at least brought them back to Huddersfield for a replay.”
Town's sense of ‘what might have been' was fuelled by the manner in which Chelsea had been rocked by an equaliser from Michael Collins before half-time.

Roared on by a travelling army of 6,000 fans who had earlier movingly chanted their support for former manager Peter Jackson following their diagnosis with throat cancer the previous week, the Yorkshire side could then have taken the lead.
Andy Holdsworth, however, was unable to connect and, on the hour, Lampard fired in their second after Glennon had saved the England man's earlier shot. Salomon Kalou then sealed the win 20 minutes from time to end an FA Cup odyssey that had taken Huddersfield from the rundown surrounds of Accrington Stanley in round one to the King's Road.
“Chelsea had made changes but there was still the likes of Lampard, John Terry and a few others in the starting XI,” said Glennon, now a pundit with BBC Radio Leeds.
“They also brought on (Andriy) Shevchenko and (Nicolas) Anelka, so it wasn't a bad team.”
SEOUL: South Korea has banned the sale of 10 models of Nissan, BMW and Porsche vehicles after the carmakers were found to have fabricated certification documents, in the latest fallout from the Volkswagen emissions scandal.
The government announced in August that it would ban all 10 models after conducting an investigation into whether foreign carmakers besides Volkswagen AG falsified documents on emissions and noise-level tests.
Nine of the models have been banned since last month and Nissan's Qashqai diesel sport utility vehicle has been banned since June, the environment ministry said on Monday.
It said it has also fined the carmakers' local units a combined 7.17 billion won (US$5.9 million) for the affected 4,523 vehicles already sold in South Korea.
Spokespersons at the South Korean units of Nissan Motor Co Ltd and BMW AG acknowledged the findings in the government investigation, saying they would try to achieve certification for those affected models again. A spokesperson at Porsche AG, which is owned by Volkswagen, was not immediately available for comment.
South Korea has been tough with Volkswagen, filing complaints against local executives, suspending sales of most of its models and imposing fines for alleged forging of documents on emissions or noise-level tests.
In the latest move, South Korea said last month that it will file criminal complaints against five former and current executives at Volkswagen AG's South Korean unit and fine the company a record 37.3 billion won for false advertising on vehicle emissions.
South Korea's sales of imported cars fell 7 percent in the first 11 months of last year, heading for their first annual sales decline since 2009.

Toledo has a problem that likely affects other cities around the world as well: it wants to memorialize its history and its leaders, but oftentimes no one wants to lead the charge. Spearheading an initiative takes a lot of work, and often requires parting a lot of people from a little bit of their money— and don't forget all the forms and legal hoops a leader has to jump through to get the city on board. That's why people like Sue Terrill are important. Them efforts (and those of their group) are gaining widespread recognition for Edward Libbey, founder of Libbey Glass, the company that largely earned Toledo its “Glass City” nickname.
It seems strange that this city has never had an Edward Libbey Day before April 17, 2017. Not only did Libbey bring jobs and prominence to this city, but they were a champion for local works and education, including founding the Toledo Museum of Art. They were also president of Toledo's Board of Education, president of the Toledo City Plan Commission and a major benefactor of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library. In short, much of Toledo's best attributes came from the man who once made the glass.
And yet, nobody had put in the legwork that Terrill and their fellow Edward Libby Day Group members have to gain them this day. But their work isn't done yet. Currently, the group is raising $3000 to have a plaque erected on the grounds of Libbey High School (it was demolished in 2012). And they are meeting on May 10 to formulate plans to grow next year's Edward Libbey Day.
“We always knew and respected Mr. Libbey, but we didn't know anything about him,” Terrill, one of three members on the ELD board who actually attended Libbey Elementary School, said of the day. Terrill first became interested while doing research to help the campaign to save the school. But now that research has turned into a cause.
“It oftentimes takes a person or group to say we want to honor someone. And if you look at other Toledoans who have been honored, it's a short list,” said Paul Walters, a history enthusiast and former teacher who showed up for the open house presentation held at the Main Branch Library.
“We are not family members of Mr. Libbey,” said Terrill. “But all of us are beneficiaries (of their legacy. We want people to see this is coming from the citizens who really do appreciate those gifts they have given.”
Hopefully Moses Fleetwood Walker and Art Tatum, other Toledo luminaries, find champions like Terrill and their group.

Breathing dirty air causes stress hormones to spike, new research suggests, which could help explain why long-term exposure to pollution is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and a shorter life span.
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Breathing dirty air causes stress hormones to spike, new research suggests, which could help explain why long-term exposure to pollution is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and a shorter life span.
Dr. Haidong Kan of Fudan University in Shanghai, China, and colleagues looked specifically at the health effects of particulate matter (PM), small particles less than 2.5 millimeters in diameter, from industrial sources, that can be inhaled and become lodged in the lungs. While PM levels have gone down in North America in recent years, they are on the rise worldwide.
“This research adds new evidence on how exposure to PM could affect our bodies, which may (ultimately) lead to higher cardiovascular risk,” Dr. Kan told Reuters Health in an email interview. “Our result may indicate that particulate matter could affect the human body in more ways than we currently know. Thus, it is increasingly necessary for people to understand the importance of reducing their PM exposure.”
The new study, published in Circulation, included 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, a city with pollution levels in the middle range compared to other Chinese cities, according to Dr. Kan.
They and their colleagues put working or non-working air purifiers in each student's dorm and left them in place for nine days. After a 12-day period during which the filters were removed, the researchers did another nine-day test: the students in the original functioning-filter group got non-working filters, and those in the original nonfunctioning-filter group got filters that worked. At the end of each nine-day period, the researchers tested levels of a wide range of small molecules in students' blood and urine as indication of their exposure to PM.
Students' levels of the stress hormones cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine and norepinephrine rose with dirtier air, as did their levels of blood sugar, amino acids, fatty acids and lipids. Higher exposure to PM was also associated with higher blood pressure, a worse response to insulin, and markers of molecular stress on body tissues - all of which can, over time, increase the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other problems.

Air purification cut the amount of PM students were exposed to in half, from 53 micrograms per cubic meter of air to 24.3 micrograms per cubic meter – but that was still well above the World Health Organization's Air Quality Guideline of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.
Dr. Robert D. Brook of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study, told Reuters Health by email that the stress responses triggered by these small pollution particles “are larger and more varied than previously known.”
They added: “Simple actions taken at a personal level, including usage of air purifiers with HEPA filers, can substantively reduce exposures and help lessen the harmful heath effects of (PM) over a few days.”
Moving forward, they said, the findings “help set the stage for what we believe is urgently needed now - clinical trial evidence that personal-level actions (air purifiers, N95 respirators) can actually reduce hard cardiovascular events and mortality among high risk patients living in heavily polluted countries.”
“This evidence-based proof is needed to help provide clinical recommendations for the millions of people with heart diseases living in regions where the poor air quality is not likely to significantly improve over the upcoming decades,” Brook said.
“Air pollution is a global threat to the health of all humans living everywhere,” they added. “We are all at risk to the hazards of air pollution and are all at least partially responsible. It is time to move forward with cleaner ‘green' sources of energy and transportation - for our own good and for the benefit of everyone else on the planet.”

PARIS: Fiery Benoit Paire toyed with and teased the emotions of their fellow Frenchmen for a smidgeon shy of three hours on Wednesday, before bowing out of their home Grand Slam in the second round.
Beaten 6-3 2-6 4-6 6-2 6-3 by Japan's Kei Nishikori - a former U.S. Open runner-up and 19th seed in Paris - the 29-year-old showed flashes of brilliance and, at two sets to one up, large sections of the crowd had started to believe.

It was a typically flamboyant performance from Paire who, with their bushy black beard and dyed white hair, cuts quite a figure on the Roland Garros clay.
But despite all the drop shots, the pummelled backhands and the animated pleas to the crowd for support, it proved not to be enough.
"It was a beautiful match, a beautiful fight. I did what I
could and I really did my best. I would have liked - of course, I would have preferred winning. You can't win every single match," Paire told reporters.

The expected stormclouds stayed away but the crowd was denied what it yearned for: a French victor in this most French of arenas.
Nishikori's compact, safety-first game was met with mute indifference by the otherwise boisterous supporters who roared their approval and leapt up from their seats every time Paire struck a blow.
The French tennis crowd have always been enthusiastic embracers of the "Mexican Wave" and time and time again it swirled through the stands as Paire's supporters willed their man to win.
"Of course, I'm disappointed I've lost, but there's a lot of pride... of having fought back and being able to win over the audience," Paire said. "And they responded and supported me and that was really heartwarming."
Nishikori, though - as quiet as Paire is animated, as careful as Paire is hit-and-miss - refused to be diverted from them mission.
Nishikori next faces another Frenchman Gilles Simon - and patriotic crowd - after Simon beat 12th seed Sam Querrey. If the Japanese baseliner is to go deep in this tournament, they will have to do it the hard way.
"Well, today wasn't too bad. Could get more crazy here," the Japanese player smiled. "I had a couple of tough ones a couple of years ago. So I think I got used to this crowd."

Public health officials consider this year's flu season one of the worst in recent history — and with good reason. To date, more than a few dozen people have died and thousands have been hospitalized because of H3N2, the main flu subtype that's spreading across the country. And it seems the flu season will only get worse than 16 more children have died due to the outbreak, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday. While this is indeed alarming to hear, here's what parents need to know to fight the spread of the virus and help keep kids safe.
The CDC released its weekly flu report on Friday, revealing that 16 influenza-related pediatric deaths were reported for the week of Jan. 21 - 27, according to CNN. That brings the total number of children who died from the flu up to 53 since October, when the flu season began. (The CDC received 17 reports of flu-related pediatric deaths during this time period, but one of those deaths occurred during the 2015-2016 seasons, but at the time, no subtyping was performed, according to the weekly flu report.)
The 2017-2018 flu season thus far is not the deadliest in modern history; 2014-2015 saw 148 influenza-related pediatric deaths, the most out of the last four seasons, according to CDC data. But public health officials warn that this year's flu epidemic is not over — not by a long shot.
As CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told CNN:
We have not hit our peak yet, unfortunately. It is not going down yet. Really, the bottom line is there is still likely many more weeks to go.
The H3N2 strain is the same influenza strain that infected an estimated 34 million people and led to thousands of deaths during the 2014-2015 season, according to The Cut. The CDC considered that year to be a "moderately severe" flu season.
By all means, the 2014-2015 season was awful. But it seems this year's flu outbreak will have a deadlier impact. Just compare hospitalization rates: during week four of 2014-2015 season, 43 people per 100,000 landed in the hospital because of the flu. This year, 51 people per 100,000 ended up hospitalized, CNN reported. And cases continue to spike.
But why is the flu virus so dangerous this year? Norlund told The Cut it's because of how widespread the H3N2 has become across the country, explaining:
In previous seasons it tends to happen in different parts of the United States at different times. This is one of the first years we've really seen that widespread activity is everywhere. Flu is really across the board in every state at the same time.
That's why it's especially important for parents to follow all flu-fighting tips and practice proper hygiene. Young children are among the most vulnerable to the potentially deadly H3N2 strain because of their undeveloped immune systems, according to the CDC. They become more prone to serious or life-threatening flu complications, such as pneumonia.
Although this year's flu vaccine doesn't seem to be as effective as previous seasons, the CDC still urges families to get vaccinated, as studies show that annual immunization helps lower your odds of catching the flu. Even if it's not the best protection, it's better than none at all. In addition, parents should always wash their hands and help their children do the same, disinfect surfaces, cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home when you're ill, among other flu prevention tactics.
Not sure what to look out for? Unlike the common cold, flu symptoms come on suddenly and are typically accompanied by a fever. Your child will feel weak; have a headache, dry cough, sore throat, and runny nose; feel pain and tiredness around your eyes; have severe aches in the joints and muscles; and have warm, flushed skin, and watery red eyes.
But some symptoms indicate the illness is severe. If your child has trouble breathing, sudden dizziness, confusion, severe vomiting, convulsions, coughing up blood, or has pain or pressure in the belly or chest, it's time to take them to the doctor.
The 2017-2018 flu season doesn't seem to be calming down anytime soon. For parents, that's pretty scary news. No one wants to their child or loved one to come down with a preventable illness, or worse, lose them to it. As everyone fights to stay healthy, let's remember to do our due diligence to keep our families safe and always check with your doctor if you have concerns about your child's — or your own — well-being, but especially during flu season.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said in a report submitted to Congress this week that expanding sanctions on Russia to include new sovereign debt would have “negative spillover effects” on global financial markets and businesses.
Given Russia's large economy and deep connections to world markets, widening debt-related sanctions could hurt “both the Russian Federation and U.S. investors and businesses,” said the report, submitted to Congress on Monday and obtained by Reuters on Friday.
Russian government bonds, known as OFZs, rallied on the news of Treasury's position. Investors in OFZ bonds, popular for their lucrative yields, have been on alert about new sanctions recently and have bought Russian debt for fear of losing access to it in the future.
While Treasury's memo does not make any recommendation for or against future sanctions, the congressionally mandated report repeatedly cites the risk that expanded measures could harm U.S. investors.
The memo, which was first reported by Bloomberg, said that strengthening sanctions on sovereign debt could put downward pressure on Russian economic growth, increase the strain on the banking sector and “lead to Russian retaliation against U.S. interests” and could affect the “competitiveness of large U.S. asset managers.”
The United States imposed sanctions on Russia to punish Moscow over its 2014 annexation of Crimea. The sanctions targeted some of the most important sectors of the Russian economy by limiting U.S. financing available to some of Russia's most powerful energy enterprises and banks.
For example, last year Washington toughened restrictions on energy giants like Gazprom and Lukoil, prohibiting U.S. banks from issuing them new debt with longer than 60-day maturity.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday that new sanctions would eventually be imposed on Russia in response to Moscow's interference in the U.S. election.
A Treasury spokesperson said in an emailed reply to questions that while expanding the debt sanctions even more would hurt Russia, it could also “hinder U.S. business in both the financial sector and real economy and potentially disrupt global markets.”
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday published a list of 210 Russians, including 96 so-called oligarchs worth $1 billion or more, as required under a sanctions law passed by Congress.
It did not, however, immediately impose any new penalties on them, drawing criticism from senior Democrats in Congress, who accused Trump of being soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
All candidates for the seat — currently held by longtime Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Costa Mesa), who is running for reelection this year — have been invited.
Unlike Richards' new, much smaller All My Friends festival in downtown L.A., Hard Summer (which remains under Live Nation's auspices) looks to continue more or less as it has been over the last few years. It will return to the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana and is expected to draw close to its peak of around 150,000 fans over two days.
An “earthquake atlas” that details Cebu's earthquake fault line and areas vulnerable to it was launched by the Philippine Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) in Cebu City yesterday.
Dr. Renato Solidum Jr., Science and Technology undersecretary and acting Phivolcs chief, said their Metro Cebu Earthquake Model (MCEM) Atlas can aid local officials in mapping out their own contingency plans for their local governments.
Solidum said their MCEM Atlas which can be downloaded through the Phivolcs website (www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph) can be used as reference by local governments, developers and homeowners in building earthquake resistant homes and buildings.
The launching was attended by Metro Cebu and provincial officials.
Solidum warned that the Central Cebu fault line which cuts through five cities and three towns, can cause a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that “can result in thousands of casualties.”
The Central Cebu Fault runs through the cities of Cebu, Talisay, Danao, Naga and Toledo and the towns of Compostela, Minglanilla and Balamban.
“Aside from loss of life, these will also result to damages to major infrastructure facilities, temporary loss of water and energy supply, revenue, livelihood and it would affect transportation and mobility. This needs to be addressed (before the powerful earthquake hits Cebu),” Solidum said.
They said the atlas is a seismic ground motion hazard assessment plan specific for Metro Cebu.
“Local governments can reference the atlas for their land use plan. We can reduce the incidence of destroyed properties (that way),” Solidum said.
They said they plan to “laypersonize” the atlas for the average user and include other data like surveys to determine how safe a structure/house is from an earthquake.
Nagiel Bañacia, chief of the Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO), said the atlas can be used for their disaster preparedness program in dealing with quake hit areas in the city.
“The fault line in Cebu City can be found in the mountain barangays like Tabunan, Tagbao, Lusaran and Sudlon I. We also conduct trainings in barangays to capacitate them against disasters and calamities,” they said.
Baltazar Tribunalo, Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Officer (PDRRMO), said the atlas can be used to remind families to retrofit their house design to make it quake resistant.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that welfare and social spending must take precedence over the increased military expenditure demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump.
BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that welfare and social spending must take precedence over the increased military expenditure demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The conservative leader's Social Democratic (SPD) rivals in an election on Sept. 24 have accused them of bowing to the U.S. administration's demand that Germany meet NATO's spending target of 2 percent of national output on defence.
The SPD, who lag Merkel's Christian Democrats in the polls by some 15 percentage points, said Germany would have to nearly double current defence spending from 37 billion euros (US$43.65 billion) to meet the NATO target.
Merkel's ruling coalition, which includes the SPD as junior partner, has approved defence spending hikes that fall short of the NATO target.

That didn't take long at all.
At 11:20 Wednesday morning, a train carrying Republican lawmakers through Virginia rammed a garbage truck that was stopped on the tracks. A passenger in the truck died.
Just over an hour later, the AP could offer some facts:
BREAKING: White House: 1 dead in Virginia train-truck collision, no lawmakers or staff seriously injured. — The Associated Press (@AP) January 31, 2018
And only 65 minutes after that, a fully-fledged conspiracy theory was launched and promoted on Twitter:
The Amtrak train crash featuring Republican members of Congress was a false flag orchestrated by the Deep State in an attempt to avoid the release of the FISA Abuse memo, according to White House sources. #TrainCrash https://t.co/TegVlQM0aN — Your Newswire (@yournewswire) January 31, 2018
That's quite a conclusion to come to after a 65-minute investigation, but then YourNewsWire has been one of the more cheerfully shameless of the fake news sites. Others resort to hard-to-see figleaf disclaimers or to claims they are “just raising questions,” but YourNewsWire goes straight for the bald fabrication. It's more straightforward, on some level.
Gateway Pundit was more coy, claiming only that “rumours swirl” after the accident, and embedding tweets that claimed the crash was “deep state sabotage,” and insisting in all caps that “NOTHING IS COINCIDENCE.”
At InfoWars, Alex Jones asked if “the stalled dump truck crash meant to send a warning to lawmakers to block Trump's agenda.” Jones quickly produced two YouTube videos floating conspiracy theories about the accident. When we looked them they were the #5 and #8 results for a YouTube search for train gop time-limited to the last week. At the time, they had about 140,000 views.
Another strain of argument, which blazed very brightly on Twitter Wednesday, blamed Antifa, it being an immovable article of faith in some circles that whenever a mishap involves a train, Antifa must in some way be behind it.

Now, the fever swamp is what it is, and there's not much to be done about that — the Alex Joneses of the world will always be with us.
The practical question is how the grownups should respond. The Internet democratized the means of publication, which we'd still like to believe did more good than harm, but as we know, it also has its dark side.
The platforms — Google, YouTube, Facebook — to a large extent have left editorial decision-making to their algorithms. Sometimes this works out, and other times, like when Google's top stories featured a 4chan thread for hours accusing the wrong person of being the Las Vegas gunman, it doesn't.
On Wednesday, the Daily Beast pointed out that conspiracy theories were a prominent feature of the ‘People Are Saying' feature of the Facebook topic page on the incident. Facebook conceded that “the type of stuff we're seeing today is a bad experience,” and promised a fix.
But the cycle has become a familiar one:
In a breaking news situation, the platforms' algorithms publish fake news and conspiracy theories, unbeknownst to the platform
Humans point out the problem to the platform
Humans at the platform fix the immediate problem, but not the larger reason the problem occurred, which is editorial decision-making by machine
The platform, embarrassed, promises to do better
WATCH: GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne said in a phone interview Wednesday that the “train jerked very hard” when describing a train collision with a garbage truck in Virginia. At least one person, an occupant of the truck, is reported dead.

State prosecutors in Germany have started fresh enquiries into suspicions of market manipulation at Volkswagen as part of the diesel emission scandal, German magazine WirtschaftsWoche cited a spokesperson for the investigators as saying on Tuesday.
BERLIN: Volkswagen said on Tuesday that its global headquarters were searched again by German prosecutors in early March as part of an investigation into its diesel emissions scandal, confirming a magazine report.
WirtschaftsWoche reported earlier on Tuesday that state prosecutors had started fresh enquiries into suspicions of market manipulation at Volkswagen (VW) to determine whether VW had understated carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) on more cars than it had publicly admitted.
Authorities from the city of Braunschweig searched 13 offices in the nearby VW headquarters in Wolfsburg at the start of March, seizing documents and computer files that will now be reviewed over the next few weeks, WirtschaftsWoche cited a spokesperson for the investigators as saying.
The authorities said they were checking a statement issued by VW on Dec. 9, 2015 over suspicions its contents were not correct and whether it therefore represented a case of market manipulation.
VW shares did not react to the news of new searches and were trading up 0.4 percent at 160.2 euros at 0827 GMT.
VW said in Dec. 2015 that its own investigations found it had understated fuel consumption, and hence CO2 emissions, on no more than 36,000 vehicles. That was much lower than its own preliminary estimate of around 800,000 vehicles disclosed five weeks earlier.

It also said it had found no evidence of unlawful alterations to CO2 emissions data, providing some relief as it battled the fallout from emissions cheating revealed by United States regulators in Sept. 2015.
WirtschaftsWoche quoted VW as saying that it believed it met the requirements for such regulatory statements.
A VW spokesperson merely confirmed that latest searches in Wolfsburg but declined further comment. The prosecutor's office in Braunschweig was not immediately available to comment when contacted by Reuters.

In a new study from Temple University's Fox School of Business, three researchers found something that anyone who's ever gotten irritated on Instagram can confirm: the short-term returns of social marketing couldbe offset by long-term drawbacks. The reason? Brands are overdoing it.
"Firms and consumers hold different views of social media," said Shuting Wang, the study's lead author. "Firms see a potential to contact consumers, but users can consider commercialized social posting annoying if they are too frequent or sent at busy times."
Wang and co-author Paul Pavlou were quick to note that the study is limited in scope, since their data came from a single CPG firm advertising to Chinese customers using WeChat (the Chinese equivalent of Facebook). But the results were clear: without the right strategy, social marketing can drive consumers away permanently. While the brand they studied saw a 5 percent bump in sales immediately following a social post, it experienced an overall 300 percent drop in engagement in the form of unfollows—the brand lost an audience it had already captured.
The study squares, to some extent, with the experiences of Jeff Nichols, CMO at digital agency VaynerMedia. "It takes a lot of risk in associating a negative connotation with social advertising, but the callout is correct," they said. "You have to realize that there's both risk and reward on social and not have a negative interaction."
Instead, effective social campaigns should be highly nuanced, taking into account not only audience demographics but how the product plays—or, more importantly, if it doesn't—on a feed. Nichols pointed to VaynerMedia's recent work for carpet cleaner StainMaster as an example of how to leverage social for a brand that doesn't naturally gel with those platforms.
"For CPG products that aren't exciting and cool like SnapChat, you have to create an environment in which you can talk to a person and still relate to your product," they said. "We created content"—a series of narrative spots—"that had entertainment aspect in a social environment. No one would watch the classic ‘swipe two windows side by side' TV commercial, but they did watch a minute and a half video that looked like a movie trailer."
Wang's study examined ads with much lower production value, but the findings likely apply to campaigns of any budget, since the takeaways related less to how to market a brand but when. Engagement dropped most steeply during commute hours and among consumers in big cities— in other words, people who are already stressed and look to social media as a way to escape or relax. It's the last time anyone wants to see an ad they've already scrolled past, or one for a product they've already purchased.
"The main thing brands should take away from this study is that they need to be careful," said Pavlou. "There's a tendency to send too many messages, because that short-term bump looks nice, but companies [need to] focus on the long-term effect. Otherwise, they'll annoy customers, not only in the moment but in association with the brand."
Nichols said he's personally experienced that annoying moment of seeing something they bought pop up in their feed, but they cautioned brands and agencies not to get spooked after reading Wang's study. Take heed, certainly, but don't panic.
"Audit from the top around common sense: who is going to buy my product, and do they want to talk to me on these platforms? Then, audit how much control you have over your data to understand what you can signal off of to move people in different clusters. And finally, audit your strategy and how you deploy your investment, and what partners are doing that on your behalf."
Because as both they and the researchers agreed, eliminating, or even reducing, social spend is a losing move. Brands must adapt or die—just look at Dollar Shave Club, whose social campaigns formed deep bonds with customers and helped the upstart brand trample longstanding competition.
"All the Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies losing market share, it's always to B2C market players who are doing well in these spaces," Nichols said. "Those brands are going to win because they're speaking to consumers in ways they want to speak with brands."

LONDON British Prime Minister Theresa May edged closer to clinching a deal to stay in power with the support of Northern Irish kingmakers on Wednesday, but faced a battle over Brexit just days before divorce talks are due to begin.After days of political turmoil sparked by their botched gamble on a snap election, May's Conservative Party resumed talks with a small Northern Irish Protestant party on securing the support of its 10 members of parliament to pass legislation.May said late on Wednesday that the talks were continuing, but that a fire that devastated a 24-storey tower block in London, killing at least 12 people, had taken priority. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), met May for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday but Sky News reported they had returned to Belfast on Wednesday evening, leaving party colleagues to continue the negotiations."We are continuing to have talks but today, as you will imagine, there has been a real focus on this terrible tragedy in London," May said.Even with a deal nearing to secure their government's survival, May is so weakened that their Brexit strategy has become the subject of public debate inside their own party, with two former prime ministers urging them to soften their approach.May has said the divorce talks, likely to be the most complex in Europe since World War Two, will begin as planned next week and their Brexit minister, David Davis, said Britain's negotiating position was unchanged. "There is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom," May said following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. "It's a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that their government gets on with that and makes a success of it."But with so much at stake for Britain and its $2.5 trillion economy, pressure was mounting on May from within and without their party to heed other voices.
May now faces the task of satisfying both the pro-European and eurokceptic factions of their party, keeping Northern Ireland calm and negotiating a divorce with 27 other EU members whose combined economic might is more than five times that of Britain.ALICE IN WONDERLAND?
Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU, involving withdrawal from the EU single market, limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU.The Times newspaper said finance minister Philip Hammond would push May not to leave the customs union - an arrangement that guarantees tariff-free trade within the bloc but prohibits members from striking trade deals with third parties.But a newly appointed junior Brexit minister, Steve Baker, told Reuters: "I don't foresee any change ... The reality is that where we stand follows logically from leaving, so, if we're leaving, what we need to do is do it smoothly and successfully and gain economic benefit."France's Macron said the door was still open for Britain to remain in the EU, though they added that it would be difficult to walk back once negotiations start.
The European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, struck a harsher tone: Britain, they said, could change its mind, but it would be poorer."Like Alice in Wonderland, not all the doors are the same. It will be a brand-new door, with a new Europe, a Europe without rebates, without complexity, with real powers and with unity," Verhofstadt said.May has not yet responded to a proposal from some Conservatives for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to agree a national position on Brexit. "We would restore faith in politics if we could show that this parliament can at least function in presenting a view in the national interest which would command a majority on a cross-party basis," said veteran pro-European Conservative lawmaker Ken Clarke.Former prime minister David Cameron said May needed to listen to opposition parties, and that there would be pressure for a softer Brexit that would give greater priority to a close trading deal with the EU.
Yet many of their lawmakers and party members favour a sharp break with the EU - a sign of the divisions over Europe that helped sink the premierships of May's predecessors Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Cameron. The performance of the British economy could also influence perceptions: Data on Wednesday showed average weekly pay in the three months to April was down 0.4 percent, year-on-year, in inflation-adjusted terms - the biggest fall since the three months to September 2014.

May has given no indication that they will change their plan for Brexit, though they have said they will try to achieve broader agreement across their party.Whatever their ultimate plan, they will be heavily reliant upon the 10 lawmakers from the euroskeptic DUP, who would help them edge past the 326 votes needed in parliament to avoid the government collapsing.However, putting the pro-British unionist DUP in a position of influence in London could also undermine the British government's ability, enshrined in a 1998 peace agreement, to function as an impartial broker between Northern Ireland's unionists and its Catholic Irish nationalists.Major, who helped to bring about that peace, said they were concerned that May's arrangement with the DUP could pitch the province back into turmoil by persuading 'hard men' on both sides of the divide to return to violence.The Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, which wants the British province to join a united Ireland, said the prospect was causing anxiety and fear in Northern Ireland. While the DUP are deeply euroskeptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-called hard Brexit -- including the potential loss of an open border with the Republic of Ireland -- and the talks were likely to touch on efforts to minimise the potential damage to Northern Ireland.

With the threat of a nuclear conflict growing ever more real, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to a coalition of disarmament activists that lobbied for the first treaty to ban atomic arms.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it was honoring the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons for its work “to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons.”
The decision marks an attempt to reinvigorate the drive for worldwide nuclear disarmament, a goal that appears increasingly out of reach at a time when North Korea has been carrying out aggressive tests of its nuclear technology and trading threats of annihilation with President Trump.
The U.S. administration has also signaled that Trump next week could decertify the 2015 agreement that imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, a decision that could lead to the unraveling of the landmark accord.
“We live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said when they announced the prize in Oslo. “Some states are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea.”
Though they said the committee wasn't “kicking anybody's leg with this prize,” they noted that none of the nine world powers known or believed to have nuclear weapons have so far supported the ban, which was approved by 122 countries at a United Nations meeting in July.
The treaty includes a commitment "never under any circumstances to develop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices." It also bans the transfer, use or threat to use of nuclear weapons.
The treaty will enter into force after it has been ratified by 50 parties. So far, only three have done so.
The United States and close allies, including France and Britain, have rejected the effort, calling it misguided and dangerous.
“A purported ban on nuclear weapons that does not address the security concerns that continue to make nuclear deterrence necessary cannot result in the elimination of a single nuclear weapon and will not enhance any country's security, nor international peace and security,” the three countries said in a statement issued after the treaty was adopted.
The recipient of the award, a Geneva-based coalition known by the acronym ICAN, disputes the premise that nuclear weapons are a legitimate and essential source of security.
"We can't threaten to indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of security. That's not how you build security,” the group's executive director, Beatrice Fihn, told reporters Friday.
They said ICAN received a call about the award minutes before the official announcement, but they thought it was a prank until they heard the group's name during the televised ceremony.
“This prize is a tribute to the tireless efforts of many millions of campaigners and concerned citizens worldwide who, ever since the dawn of the atomic age, have loudly protested nuclear weapons, insisting that they can serve no legitimate purpose and must be forever banished from the face of our earth,” ICAN said in a statement.

Aaron Ramsey scored a hat-trick on Saturday as Arsenal thrashed Everton 5-1 in the Premier League at the Emirates with a display of free-flowing football that the Gunners have sorely lacked away from home this season.
LONDON,: Aaron Ramsey scored a hat-trick on Saturday as Arsenal thrashed Everton 5-1 in the Premier League at the Emirates with a display of free-flowing football that the Gunners have sorely lacked away from home this season.
The home side blasted in four in the first half to put the game beyond doubt, leaving their woeful midweek loss at Swansea well behind them.
Ramsey scored twice in the first half, either side of a headed goal from defender Laurent Koscielny.
The Gunners' new record signing, Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, renewed their scoring partnership with former Borussia Dortmund teammate Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the 38th minute, chipping their neatly flicked-in pass over the onrushing goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
Everton's Theo Walcott was substituted off on the hour mark to a standing ovation from their former club, and was replaced by forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin who moments later headed in from close range.
The win leaves Arsenal unchanged in sixth place in the table, three points adrift of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Liverpool on Sunday. The Gunners travel to Spurs in a week's time.

Washington: President Donald Trump and their wife Melania met Republican Congressman Steve Scalise, who was critically injured in the shooting during a practice session for an annual baseball game in a Washington suburb.
Their surprise visit at a city hospital came late last night after a rifle-wielding man sprayed bullets during a practice session in Alexandria, Virginia.
"Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but they are a real fighter. Pray for Steve!" Trump wrote in a tweet yesterday.
Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but they are a real fighter. Pray for Steve! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017
They also met the doctors treating Scalise, including Ira Rabin, vice president for medical operations of the hospital and talked to Scalise's wife Jennifer, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters.
"He entered the room, spoke with Scalise's family, and sat by their bedside with Mrs Trump," they said.
House Majority Whip Scalise, 51, was shot in the hip while five others, including two police officers, were injured by the gunman identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, who was shot dead by the police.
Trump and their wife Melania were accompanied to the hospital by the president's personal physician Ronny Jackson. Jackson rode in the motorcade, but had been to the hospital to confer on Scalise earlier, Spicer said.
Melania offered Scalise's family a bouquet of white flowers.
Trump and Melania also met Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner and their wife. Spicer said the president and their wife talked to other Capitol Police officers who were at the hospital.
Rabin was seen accompanying the Trumps to the exit when they were leaving.
Spicer noted that Trump does not plan to attend the congressional baseball game today due to security and logistical concerns.
"While the president would like to attend the game and show their support for all of these brave public servants, they have been advised that there is not enough time to follow Secret Service protocols," they said in response to a question.
SEOUL/BEIJING: Reining in North Korea's nuclear ambitions will top South Korean President Moon Jae-in's agenda in Beijing during a visit this week aimed at breaking the ice after a furious row with China over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system.
While both Seoul and Beijing share the goal of getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two neighbours have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.
China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tensions with North Korea.
At their third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this year on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea's agreement with China in late October the two would normalise all exchanges and move past the year-long spat over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two.
The THAAD dispute had dented South Korea's economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were cancelled.
While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea's decision to deploy it.

In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD's presence is inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.
"South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China's security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this," Moon said.
Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have "good results" if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, they added.
Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have "friendly cooperation" with China, and that China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula.
In its latest missile provocation, Pyongyang test-launched what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it continues its mission to create a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the United States.
During their first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses partaking in the four-day visit.
Before returning to Seoul, Moon will head to Chongqing to meet with its Communist Party boss Chen Miner, a close ally of Xi's.

Chrissy Teigen wants to expand their family, but she's nervous about doing it the old fashioned way.
“I would definitely adopt or have foster children. But I loved being pregnant. Maybe I should be scared [of having postpartum depression again], but I don't know,” they tell Marie Claire's July issue. “It couldn't be any worse than it was–could it?”
Teigen, 31, welcomed daughter Luna with husband John Legend in April 2016. They were later diagnosed with anxiety, which they treat with an anti-depressant.
“Every step I take feels a little shaky,” they said. “It's such a weird feeling that you wouldn't know unless you have really bad anxiety … You feel like everyone is looking at you.”
They didn't reveal their battle with postpartum depression until nearly a year later, in Glamour's April issue.
“I was different than before. Getting out of bed to get to set on time was painful. My lower back throbbed; my shoulders — even my wrists — hurt,” they told the publication. “I didn't have an appetite, would go two days without a bite of food, and you know how big of a deal food is for me. One thing that really got me was just how short I was with people.”
The “Cravings” cookbook author struggled just to leave the house.
“I'd ask people who came inside why they were wet. Was it raining? How would I know — I had every shade closed,” they revealed. “Most days were spent on the exact same spot on the couch and rarely would I muster up the energy to make it upstairs for bed.”
Legend later said it was their “job” to support their wife through their battle.
If anything, the Clippers have concluded over the last two days, they can't let the Utah Jazz be the sole instigators of all the action in their first-round playoff series.
“The point is we have to join in,” Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said. “They're still going to do what they do. They should. That's who they are. But we didn't do what we usually do. So when you have two teams who are both trying to instigate action, it's a better game. It's a better game for us. I don't know if we can take it away from them. I think we just have to do it ourselves.”
Undoubtedly, the first provocation wasn't delivered by the Clippers, who are down 1-0 to the Jazz in the best-of-seven series that resumes Tuesday night at Staples Center.
Rivers knows how their team can initiate things.
“Just hitting first. Engaging first,” they said. “I thought they engaged first in everything. They blew up a lot of our dribble handoffs — a lot of things where we just went to the ball instead of engaging them and getting into it first. It's simple, but you have to do it.”
Clippers unfazed about Redick
On the surface, the Clippers weren't overly concerned about Utah's concentrated effort to ground J.J. Redick.
By keeping defenders close to Redick, the Jazz limited the Clippers' shooting guard to only six shots; they made three and scored seven points.
Utah's guards stayed attached as much as possible to Redick and also ran them off the three-point line. Utah's big men slowed the constantly moving Redick by stepping in front of them and not giving them a direct line to their spots on the court.
When asked how the Clippers were going to get Redick going, Rivers said they aren't worried about the team's proficient three-point shooter getting more involved.
“I don't worry about that, because in the past when teams have paid a lot of attention to J.J., it opens up other things for other guys and we end up scoring,” Rivers said. “I thought we spent too much time trying to get J.J. going, quite honestly. I think J.J. is going to get going. We're going to get them shots. But when we're not getting them shots, we should be getting layups and other shots. We didn't do either one.”
Injury update
Reserve guard Austin Rivers, who has sat out the Clippers' last seven games because of a left hamstring injury, will not play in Game 2. Doc Rivers said that their son was “probably out for Game 3 as well.”…Jazz center Rudy Gobert, who suffered a hyperextension and bruise bone in their left knee early in Saturday's game, won't play in Game 2.

A single arrow was nestled symbolically in the treble 20 bed on the dartboard adorning their coffin.
And as a glittering cast of champions turned out to pay their respects, Eric Bristow checked out for the last time.
The Crafty Cockney, who collapsed and died suddenly – aged 60 – at a Premier League darts event in Liverpool earlier this month, was laid to rest in the Potteries they had adopted as their home.
Among the mourners were 16-times world champion Phil 'The Power' Taylor, the protege they mentored to greatness, current world No.1 Michael van Gerwen and old rivals from Bristow's heyday on the oche including John Lowe, Cliff Lazarenko and Dennis Priestley.

Despite teeming rain, hundreds gathered outside the Carmountside crematorium in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, to bid farewell to the first superstar of darts at a private funeral for family and close friends.
When the cortege arrived, with proud patriot Bristow's coffin draped in the Union flag, the Embassy world championship trophy they lifted five times between 1980-86 made the final journey with him.
And there was standing room only in the packed chapel, with some of the congregation wearing Bristow's favourite red polo shirts – the colour they often wore on stage.

Keith Deller, who beat Bristow in the 1983 world championship final, was also at the service and conveyed the sadness which transcends a sport.
They said on Twitter: “Today we say goodbye to our friend and a darting genius... we will remember the good times and say our farewells but the sporting icon will always live on. RIP Eric.”
After the 45-minute service, hundreds of Bristow's friends and well-wishers convened in some of their favourite watering holes in their long-time home town Leek, Staffs.

In the Black Swan, the Rewind Bar and the Fountain, drinkers raised pints of Guinness – Bristow's favourite tipple – on the day before what would have been their 61st birthday.
When news of the Crafty Cockney's death filtered through to 8,000 stunned fans at Liverpool's Echo Arena on the night they died, they broke into a spontaneous chorus: “There's only one Eric Bristow.”
Earlier this month Taylor, who was launched towards their astonishing success by a £10,000 bursary from Bristow 30 years ago, paid tribute saying: “Eric was like a brother to me. Quite simply, I owe them everything.”

Prospect and main camp to be held from August 25 to 30 at Western Financial Place
The Kootenay Ice announced the schedule for their 2017 training camp on Monday afternoon and also revealed the full list of players who will be in attendance.
The six-day camp begins with a ‘Prospects Camp' which starts on Friday, August 25. The team's ‘Main Camp', for returning players, will then begin on Monday, August 28.
The prospects camp will include 12 ice times, as well as fitness testing, meetings and presentations with Ice staff members. Main Camp will follow a similar schedule but with 18 ice times and will also feature a barbecue with players, parents, billets and alumni.
The camp will include several intrasquad scrimmages with groups, named after former Ice players and current team ambassadors, facing off at various times.
As part of the prospects camp, Team Cracknell will play Team Sinclair at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 26 and again on Sunday, August 27 at the same time.
At main camp, Cracknell will play Sinclair at 3:00 p.m. on Monday, August 28. On Tuesday, Cracknell will play Team Lieuwen at 10:00 a.m. and Sinclair will play Lieuwen at 4:45 p.m.
The intrasquad Black/White game will then be held at 7:00 p.m on Wednesday, August 30.
The roster for camp includes 31 forwards, 18 defencemen and six goalies. This list features 16 returning players and 19 players who spent the majority of last season in the WHL.
Players from last year's roster who are not returning include forwards Austin Wellsby and Reed Morison, defencemen Troy Murray, Kurtis Rutledge and Fedor Rudakov, and goaltender Payton Lee.
Only two of these players were known to not be returning to the Ice; Lee aged out of the WHL at the conclusion of the 2016-17 season and Wellsby announced their signing with the BCHL's Chilliwack Chiefs in late June.
With the absence of Wellsby, Murray and Rutledge, the Ice are already at their allowed three 20-year-old players for next season with those spots taken by returning forward Colton Kroeker and off-season acquisitions Jordan Henderson, a defenceman, and Mario Petit, a goalie.
Training Camp sessions will be held at Western Financial Place and are free to the public, however, the team stated in their release that “donations to the Ice Education Fund will be accepted and greatly appreciated.”
For a complete look at the training camp schedule and roster, follow the links on the team's original press release on their website.

CRYSTAL PALACE 0 HUDDERSFIELD TOWN 3
Aug 12 (Reuters) – Striker Steve Mounie scored twice as promoted Huddersfield stunned Crystal Palace with a 3-0 victory at Selhurst Park, spoiling Frank de Boer's debut as a Premier League coach on Saturday.
Huddersfield took the lead after 23 minutes when Aaron Mooy's corner was turned goalwards by Chris Schindler's glancing header and the ball went in off Palace defender Joel Ward in a goalmouth melee.
The visitors, who outmuscled Palace in midfield in the opening 45 minutes, went two up three minutes later, their new signing Mounie heading Mooy's cross emphatically past Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.
Mounie, who joined the promoted side from France's Montpellier in July, scored their second goal 12 minutes from time in a counter-attack after being set up by substitute Collin Quaner.
Forwards Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke both had chances to put Palace, who staved off relegation last season, back in the game in the dying minutes of the first half, while Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl made good saves from both in the second.

This statement was originally published on rsf.org on 24 November 2017.
As Honduras prepares for a presidential election on 26 November 2017, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) voices deep concern about the appalling state of media freedom in this Central American country.
Eight years after a coup d'état in June 2009, the level of press freedom is still sinking in Honduras. Journalists continue to be the targets of judicial proceedings, violence and murder, reinforcing a climate of fear and self-censorship that has worsened under Juan Orlando Hernández, the president since January 2014.
After getting the supreme court to strike articles from the constitution banning a second presidential term in 2015, Hernández is running for reelection and is expected to win. Their record on media freedom during their first term was particularly bad, so the prospect of their reelection is very disturbing for RSF.
Dangerous country for journalists
Honduras is one of the western hemisphere's most dangerous countries for the media. According to its National Commission for Human Rights (CONADEH), 70 journalists and media workers were killed in Honduras from January 2001 until August of this year. No fewer than 91% of these cases are still unpunished.
According to RSF's tally, at least four journalists have been killed in direct connection with their work since January 2014. The latest murder, that of Canal 22 journalist Carlos William Flores on 13 September, caused an international outcry. Many other journalists have been killed in Honduras in recent years but, in the absence of reliable information and proper investigations, it is hard to establish a clear link between their murder and their journalistic work.
The creation of a national mechanism for protecting human rights defenders and journalists in May 2015 has unfortunately not led to any improvement. Lacking staff and funding, this mechanism has yet to meet initial expectations. And in a country mired in corruption and impunity, it inspires no confidence in journalists.
In March 2017, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) voiced concern about the mechanism's ineffectiveness and made a number of recommendations, shared by RSF, for improving it.
"On the eve of this presidential election, we sound the alarm about the extremely dangerous environment in which Honduran journalists are operating," said Emmanuel Colombié, the head of RSF's Latin America desk.
"The winner of this election, whoever they are, needs to address the difficult task of ending this spiral of violence and reviving the status of journalism in Honduras. This requires political will and concrete action to reinforce the protection and risk-prevention mechanisms in a sustainable manner, to combat impunity and to end the systematic censorship of those who criticize."
State censorship, judicial proceedings
The Hernández administration has used all possible means to try to control reporting and gag critics. The community media and opposition press have in particular been subjected to measures that include restrictions on access to public information, difficulty getting accreditation, procedural harassment and threats.
Journalists who investigate violence, human rights violations, corruption, organized crime and organized crime's infiltration of the state are the most likely to be the targets of reprisals.
The cases of Libertad TV director and presenter Ariel Armando D'Vicente, who was sentenced to three years in prison in 2016 on a defamation charge, and Julio Ernesto Alvarado, the target of prolonged judicial proceedings, are prime examples of how the authorities persecute critics.
A Radio Globo y TV presenter, Alvarado was prosecuted on a defamation charge in 2013 and was then banned from working as a journalist in 2015. RSF has issued many press releases about their case.
Many other journalists, whom RSF met during a visit to Honduras last month, are embroiled in complex problems in which they are being targeted by organized crime or corrupt elected officials.
They include Jonny Lagos, the editor of the El Libertador newspaper, who escaped a murder attempt in Tegucigalpa on 26 August, Jairo Lopez, the victim of a major smear campaign and defamation proceedings marred by irregularities, and Milthon Robles, who fled to Spain in December 2016 to escape the threats they were getting in Honduras.
Honduras is ranked 140th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2017 World Press Freedom Index. In 2008, it was ranked 100th.
Freedom University provides education for immigrants
Wednesday, April 12, the College of William and Mary kicked off the third of three campus COLL 300 presentations on “Inclusion and the University” with a presentation by Executive Director of Freedom University Emiko Soltis. Soltis was accompanied by Rafael, Mileidi and Irene, three students from Freedom University whose last names are being withheld because they are living in the U.S. illegally. The theme of this session, coordinated by Hispanic Studies Program Director and professor Silvia Tandeciarz, was “unrest.”
Freedom schools were alternative, temporary free schools in the South for African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. Freedom University is inspired by these schools and provides a tuition-free education for undocumented students banned from higher education in Georgia.
“I started teaching as a volunteer professor back in 2013 and my experience specifically with student labor activism and civil disobedience came in handy when students wanted to be more engaged in terms of coming out of the shadows, not just going to a secret school,” Soltis said. “I have 40 incredible students in my life every semester who change me, and I also have the opportunity to have a really big impact on their life, not only as a teacher but as somebody who absolutely affirms their humanity and their dream of going to college — their dream of doing anything that they want.”
Soltis discussed the foundation and principles of the university. Freedom University provides tuition-free, college-level classes, application assistance and leadership development for students living in the United States illegally who are denied higher-level education. Its mission statement begins, “We believe that all human beings — regardless of race, ethnicity, class, religion, gender, sexual orientation or citizenship status — have a right to education.”
The university first opened its doors in 2011 to combat the passage of Georgia Board of Regents Policies 4.1.6 and 4.3.4, which ban youth living in the United States illegally from attending Georgia's top five public universities and from receiving in-state tuition. According to their website, the implications of these policies are a prime example of modern era segregation in southern educational facilities.
Soltis joined Freedom University in 2013 as a volunteer professor and is now the executive director for the university. Having spent most of their twenties working with immigrant communities fighting for immigrant rights with migrant farmworkers, Soltis said they were more than qualified to take on a role fighting for students living in the United States illegally.
I think what's also rewarding is being able to see that it's not just theory of social movements or that young people can change things, but to actually be a part of a movement that's transforming a national dialogue on a very important issue: creating change step by step though changing private university admission policies to winning gains on these discriminatory laws to changing culture,” Soltis said.
“I think what's also rewarding is being able to see that it's not just theory of social movements or that young people can change things, but to actually be a part of a movement that's transforming a national dialogue on a very important issue: creating change step by step though changing private university admission policies to winning gains on these discriminatory laws to changing culture,” Soltis said.
During the presentation, the presenters, who were all born in Mexico, shared a glimpse into the life of students living in the United States without legal permission.
Irene crossed the U.S. border first at age one, then again at age three. For their second journey to the United States, they and their mother used borrowed Visas: Irene, per their paperwork, became a boy and their mother became their aunt.
Rafael, who crossed the border around the age of six, said they recalled always being aware of their lack of documentation. They said it robbed them of childhood pleasures and socialization as a young adult. Rafael said that while getting pulled over while driving is next to nothing for most people, for them it would have resulted in being ripped from the arms of their family and dumped in a country they knew nothing about.
Mileidi discussed similar feelings as Rafael, particularly the embarrassment that came from constantly fabricating excuses as to why they could not do seemingly normal things and the fear that accompanied everyday actions.
Irene said their visit to the College was “what would have been the college experience for me.”
As a result of the Georgia laws, many youths who entered the country illegally do not get a college experience. The plan for many of these students is to go straight into the work force after graduating from high school. The presenters said that the Georgia Board of Regents Policies 4.1.6 and 4.3.4 deny the human right to education to students living in the United States illegally.
“Freedom U is an institution that helps undocumented students get into college,” Mileidi said. “It teaches about activism and how we can become more involved in our communities, how to successfully plan and execute an event. It brings a sense of community to undocumented students; it helps us feel more normal, more like students.”
The Freedom University students were housed and accompanied by students from the College's Border Studies Program. Students like Grace Norwaldy '17 went on a one-week trip to Tucson, Ariz. to learn about the border crisis first-hand. The students talked to lawyers and activist groups, and visited a detention center to get an “on-the-ground perspective” of the issue.
“The organization that sponsored us, they're kind of motto is, ‘Come to Tucson, see what it's like here, then go back home and act somehow',” Norwaldy said. “This was our action when we got back, to host the Freedom University students. I think what's been really striking to all of us is that they're — I don't want to call them normal kids, but like they're anyone I would know here.”
During a question and answer session at the end of the presentation, one individual brought up the possibility of professors at the College teaching classes online for Freedom University. The panel said that the best way for people to get involved and assist the movement is to be informed allies — to research and read up on immigration conditions and laws, then sit down with family, friends and peers and spread the knowledge.
No matter who you are and no matter where you are there's something you can do to help,” Norwaldy said.
“No matter who you are and no matter where you are there's something you can do to help,” Norwaldy said.
At the end, Freedom University representatives thanked the faculty and staff of the College. The thanks were complemented by pleas for those in attendance to sit down with someone and discuss what they had learned from the presentation and spread the word of Freedom University and its mission.
“[People] should just treat us like humans,” Irene said. “Have respect for other people, do not just assume they are immigrants. Treat us normal, because we are all human beings.”

(CNN) – A 9-year-old boy retrieved a gun from their parents' bedroom and shot their 13-year-old sister to death, authorities said, after the two got into an argument over a video game controller.
The incident occurred over the weekend in rural Monroe County, Mississippi, as the children's mother was preparing lunch in the kitchen, the county sheriff said.
“He wanted the controller, and I guess they knew where to find the gun,” Sheriff Cecil Cantrell told CNN.
The boy grabbed a handgun, which was kept in a nightstand next to the bed, and shot the sister in the back of the head, the sheriff said.
“This is the first time I've ever dealt with any child that was shot like that,” Cantrell said. “And I hope I never deal with it again.”
The girl was taken to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, where they were pronounced dead Sunday. The case is still under investigation and authorities have not filed charges. “We are talking to the district attorney,” Cantrell said.
Sometimes scrolling through your Twitter feed can feel like a real bummer. There's an awful lot of nasty political commentary and negative trolling going on. And yet, sometimes you stumble upon something that's so pure, so uplifting, you can't help but smile. When I saw Jordan Adam's post about their nephew Ethan's preschool cookbook, I had to give it a look. I'm so glad I did because these recipes from preschoolers will seriously make your day. If you've lost faith in humanity, all you need to do is a take a look at what these tots have cooking, and your hope will be restored.
I have a preschool-aged daughter who loves to help me in the kitchen. They like dumping in the spices and licking the bowl, naturally. But I know that if they were the one creating the recipes, we'd end up with a bowl full of sugar, chocolate chips, milk, and all of the sprinkles. From perusing Ethan's class cookbook, it seems like she'd be best buds with Ethan himself, who was the mastermind behind "Ethan's Eggs." It turns out you don't need eggs for this genius recipe, just pancakes, sugar, and sprinkles! And if you're thinking of heading to the grocery store to stock up on these key ingredients, slow your roll. According to Ethan, the best place to buy them is none other than the Texas Roadhouse, though you can go to their house for the "eggs" you won't need anyway.
If you read through the recipe for Ariana's Macaroni, you'll quickly realize that this little girl really thinks outside the box. Who said recipes need to be limited to edible ingredients anyway? To make their mouthwatering mac n' cheese, you'll need toys, a backpack and a doll! Another gem of theirs comes from their detailed cooking instructions, which reveals that she's got a party to go to and that their sister sure does ask a lot of questions.
"The oven has to be hot like fire…like a candle…like for birthdays. Now you need to tell everyone that its time to leave. And I have to leave because I am going to a party with a swimming pool. My sister says, 'Why do you go to the swimming pool?' and I say, 'Because I like it.' Now I go home and I am waiting for it not to be hot and then my sister says, 'Why do you do that?' it's because you blow on the macaroni so it wont be hot. You need to wait. Now its done!" explained Ariana.
Next up in the cookbook is Joe's Tacos, but their heart really isn't in this one. No, no, poor Joe just wants to make cheesy roll ups or better yet, watermelon. And don't get them started on things like serving size or cost. "I don't even know," little Joe admitted.
Last but certainly not least you get to Sebastian's Pancakes, and while this recipe costs a whopping $70 to make, it only calls for one (very pricey) ingredient — salt. You also have to be very careful when cooking these pancakes. "You get a thingy from the house and you put it in the hot thingy. Turn on the hot thingy and it burns so you have to be careful. You make like, something and you put it in it and it cooks. Then you get a plate and finish it. Don't leave the plate on the table, you have to throw it away in the sink or the flies with get on it," advised Sebastian.
These hilarious recipes reveal so much about the pint-size chef's creating them. I can't stop laughing at the inventive ingredients they chose and the specific instructions they included‚ and it looks like I'm not the only one utterly delighted by Adam's tweet. It has been retweeted 73,209 times and liked 179,562 just at the time this story was published. Looks like a lot of people are getting ideas on what they will — or won't — be making for dinner tonight.
Horgan has spoken with both Trudeau and Notley in recent days to reiterate their government's position
B.C.'s premier says their government is trying to protect the province, not be provocative, over a proposed ban on an increase of diluted bitumen shipped from the west coast.
John Horgan said Friday that their government's announcement earlier this week is cautionary and designed to make sure B.C. doesn't suffer in the event of a catastrophic spill.
“I did not set out to be provocative,” they said at a news conference. ”In fact, I would suggest that a press release saying we're going to have a consultation should not be the foundation of a trade war between good friends.”
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley suspended talks Thursday on buying B.C. electricity, and has described the proposal as an unconstitutional attempt to stop Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline.
The expansion project would triple capacity along the pipeline between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., and increase tanker traffic off the coast seven-fold.

READ MORE: ‘That pipeline is going to get built:' Trudeau dismisses B.C.'s Trans Mountain move
Ottawa has already approved the expansion and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised again on Friday that Trans Mountain will go ahead, saying it's an important part of Canada's energy plans.
Horgan said he's spoken with both Trudeau and Notley in recent days to reiterate their government's position that expanding the pipeline would pose a significant threat to B.C.'s economy and environment.
The province is already challenging the project in Federal Court, arguing that B.C. was not adequately consulted.
The government has sought legal advice on the new proposed regulations, but that advice is confidential, Horgan said.
Talking to residents is well within the province's rights, they added.
“We are not putting in place regulations today, we are not putting in regulations at the end of the month. We are putting in place a consultation and an intentions paper so that the public has an understanding of the potential impact of a catastrophic spill within British Columbia.”
B.C. is not trying to take on the rest of the country with the proposed rules, Horgan said, but does want to be an equal partner in the federation.
They noted that there are many other issues where they agree with Notley and Trudeau, and hopes they can move forward on those.
“I think there's great potential for positive working relationships on a number of fronts and I prefer to focus on those,” they said.

An Australian archbishop, the most senior Catholic cleric in the world found guilty of concealing child sex abuse in the church, said on Wednesday they would appeal their conviction and resist pressure to resign.
SYDNEY: An Australian archbishop, the most senior Catholic cleric in the world found guilty of concealing child sex abuse in the church, said on Wednesday they would appeal their conviction and resist pressure to resign.
Philip Wilson, 67, was convicted in May of not disclosing to police abuse by another priest, James Fletcher, after being told about it in 1976 by two victims, one of them an altar boy who told them inside the confessional.

They have stepped aside as archbishop of Adelaide, but has not resigned, despite pressure from Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as well as victims' groups.
"I intend to lodge an appeal against my conviction," Wilson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
"I do not intend to resign at this time. However, if I am unsuccessful in my appeal, I will immediately offer my resignation to the Holy See."
Lawyers for Wilson, who maintained their innocence throughout the legal process, had argued that they did not know Fletcher had abused a boy. Fletcher was found guilty in 2004 of nine counts of child sexual abuse and died in jail in 2006 after a stroke.

Wilson was sentenced on Tuesday to a year's detention over the cover-up, but remains on bail while they are assessed by prison authorities for home detention, instead of jail.
"I am surprised that they have not resigned," Turnbull had told reporters in South Australia on Wednesday. "Clearly, given the outcome of the case, the lawsuit and prosecution, they should resign."
Allegations of sexual abuse cover-ups have continued to rock the Catholic Church years after perpetrators of sexual abuse started regularly appearing before the courts.

The Charleston Marathon charity event was held Saturday morning at 8 a.m.
The Charleston Marathon is a community event to benefit the Youth Endowment for the Arts program.
The program provides a way to enhance the educational experience of children in the Lowcountry. Youth Endowment for the Arts offers equitable, quality cultural arts experiences to Charleston area children. With the support of the Charleston County School District, the Charleston Marathon helps bring arts to the students along with an awareness of the importance of fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
The course time length had a 6.5-hour time limit, and all runners needed to finish within that window to receive an official time and a finisher's metal.
Jeffery Greene won this year's marathon, along with Esther Atkins who was the female winner and third overall winner.
The marathon started downtown near Joe Riley Stadium. The finish line was located near North Charleston High School. The route took runners through a scenic 26.2-mile run that showed the unique southern charm that is in the Lowcountry and all of its beauty and history.
To keep the runners motivated there was local entertainment spaced out through the course that paved the way. The Charleston Marathon Association provided the runners with 15 aid stations to keep them hydrated and fueled for their run and within those there were multiple first aid stations to assist with any minor injuries. To keep all participants and spectators safe there were police, EMS, medical personal and ham radio throughout the course, along with many course volunteers.
Proceeds from the Charleston Marathon go to Engaging Creative Minds, which fund fine arts programs in Charleston County schools.

A group of 69 rejected Afghan asylum seekers arrived in war-torn Afghanistan's capital on Wednesday after being deported from Germany, officials told dpa.
It was the largest group since the start of direct deportation flights from Germany in December 2016.
They arrived in Kabul around 08:40 am (0410 GMT) on a chartered plane from Munich, migration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said.
One migration official accused the German government of breaking an agreement to not place more than 50 passengers on board of such flights.
Asked about the high number, German police allegedly told them they wanted to make up for the low number of people on past flights.
The largest group deported from Germany had been 34.
The latest collective deportation from Germany was the 14th since December 2016. Including Wednesday's flight, more than 300 people have been deported.
Germany had halted collective deportations after a May 2017 truck bombing in front of the German embassy in Kabul killed more than 90 people and injured some 400 others.
But Berlin restarted deportations in September in three categories: suspected terrorists, criminals, and individuals who did not cooperate with the German government regarding their documents.
The deportations are taking place amid a worsening security situation in Afghanistan.
The Taliban militants are refusing to come to the peace table and are intensifying offensives against the government and security forces. In addition, the Daesh terror group is increasing their attacks in urban areas.

Former Japanese tax agency chief Nobuhisa Sagawa, a key figure in a cronyism scandal that has sparked a political crisis for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, will be summoned to testify in parliament on March 27, a ruling party source told Reuters.
TOKYO: Former Japanese tax agency chief Nobuhisa Sagawa, a key figure in a cronyism scandal that has sparked a political crisis for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, will be summoned to testify in parliament on March 27, a ruling party source told Reuters.
Abe's support ratings have dropped sharply since the finance ministry said it had altered records relating to a discounted sale of state-owned land to school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which had ties to Abe's wife, Akie Abe.
Opposition lawmakers have been calling for Sagawa, who headed the division that submitted the documents before they became tax agency chief in July, to testify in parliament. Sagawa resigned this month.

Rahul Gandhi on Monday is expected to be elected as the president of the Congress party, succeeding their mother Sonia Gandhi. Monday was the last date of withdrawal of nomination in the party's organisational elections.
They will however, officially take charge only on 16 December marking a generational shift in the grand old party when their mother and its longest-serving president Sonia Gandhi would formally hand over the baton to him.
They have become the sixth member of the Nehru-Gandhi family to take charge of the Grand Old Party of India.
Senior party leader M Veerappa Moily said outgoing Congress president Sonia Gandhi will continue to play an effective role and guide the destiny of the party.
The Congress Working Committee (CWC) had cleared the decks for Rahul's elevation in a meeting chaired by Sonia and attended by top party leaders, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, and party general secretaries.
The 47-year-old scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family will face monumental challenges as Congress president. As Debobrat Ghose wrote for Firstpost, "Rahul as Congress vice-president failed during the Assembly elections, be it allying with the Left in West Bengal or in Uttar Pradesh. Many times, Rahul has been accused of being an absentee politician. When they take over, dealing with alliances will be a major challenge."
Another challenge would be overhauling the party cadre through internal restructuring, they wrote.
The Congress party will also have to mount a strident campaign for state elections in 2018 to begin gathering a momentum that can put it in a better position for the general elections in 2019 Hindustan Times reported.
BRUSSELS: Trying to create the shortest supply chain possible, a supermarket in Brussels is selling produce grown on its own roof only hours after being harvested.
Delhaize, a Belgian supermarket chain part of Ahold Delhaize, said it launched the "Urban Farm" project to satisfy the growing number of consumers who are concerned about where their food is sourced and eating healthy.

"The products are harvested in the morning at 8 o'clock and an hour later they're in the store," store employee Marie Delvaulx said.
The garden on the 360-square-metre roof also generates its energy sustainably with solar panels and by recuperating heat from the store building.
The farm - which this year produced tomatoes, lettuces and strawberries - operates year round and can withstand the cold months thanks to a greenhouse.
Creating a farm in a roof on city comes with some challenges. The produce can easily be destroyed because the farm lacks biodiversity to mitigate the damage from insects, and there also is the question of the weight constraints.

While the farm, the first of its kind in Delhaize stores, currently only produces a fraction of the supply needs, it will serve as a test for expanding the programme to other stores.

BEIRUT (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The screams of a dozen Syrian and Palestinian children pierce the air of a community centre in Lebanon's Shatila refugee camp.
Yet the children are not hurt. They are yelling to express the anger and fear they feel as victims of conflict in special "peace education" classes.
"We don't hit each other. We don't say bad things about each other. Boys don't hit girls," said 11-year-old Hala, who asked not to be identified for security reasons.
Hala fled Deir el Zor in Syria and has been living in Lebanon for less than two years. They said one of their favourite activities is "playback", where each child will tell a story or describe a situation that is bothering them and will have the other children act it out.
Organised by Basmeh and Zeitooneh, a local charity, the classes in a chaotic fifth floor room were set up to help children voice their opinions, release the stress caused by war and displacement and rediscover their imaginations, staff say.
They hope by providing children with activities such as painting, dram and storytelling, they will be less vulnerable to recruitment by militant groups preying on children and teenagers who may be out of school with little to occupy them.
"These kids have been through a lot. They're traumatised in many different ways," said "peace education" project manager Elio Gharios.
"They're agitated, maybe introverted, aggressive at times," they told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Lebanon is home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, half of them children.
In 1949, it opened the Shatila camp in Beirut to host Palestinian refugees fleeing Israel's founding in 1948.
As a new wave of Syrian refugees joined the ranks of the displaced, Shatila has grown upwards, with some buildings now six floors high. Houses are damp and overcrowded, and the tangled electricity wires that hang across the streets cause multiple deaths a year.
More of an urban slum than a traditional refugee camp, Shatila which covers one square kilometre is home to as many as 42,000 people, according to Rasha Shukr, the Beirut area manager for Basma and Zeitooneh.
BRAINWASHING
Gharios, a charismatic 24-year-old Lebanese psychology graduate, said children aged between seven and 14 attend the classes with up to 20 children in each session.
Each class starts with the children deciding on rules for how they can and cannot treat each other.
"They need to know that finding peaceful ways to resolve conflicts is a very important matter ... They are reminded every time that violence is not the solution, it's not the way," Gharios said.
"They're young, it is the teenagers who are easiest to brainwash. Many children know how to roll a joint, say, and they're 12 or 11. Many have witnessed things happen in here where someone would hold a gun against someone else's head."
Young Syrian refugees are at particular risk of being recruited by extremist groups in Lebanon and elsewhere because their recent displacement often fuels a sense of hopelessness, says UK-based charity International Alert, which funds projects in Shatila camp, including the classes.
Palestinian groups including Hamas militants and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement are active inside Shatila, according to charities working there.
Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, another extremist group, have also been known to target young refugees online, they say.
International Alert says these classes make children less vulnerable to recruitment because they provide them with a safe environment to discuss problems, learn conflict resolution skills and to rebuild a sense of purpose.
RECRUITMENT
Caroline Brooks, Syria projects manager at International Alert, which supports similar programmes throughout Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, said there were many reasons why children may join an extremist group.
Often there is a need for a sense of significance, purpose, and belonging, and sometimes there is a desire for revenge, they told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
A lack of alternatives and the need to make a living are also strong pull factors, Brooks said.
Conflict and displacement tend to fuel the abuse and exploitation of children, refugee experts say.
For example, many children are forced to work or beg to feed themselves and their families, young girls face greater risk of being married off and domestic violence increases, they say.
"Peace education" classes, which started this year, have already had some impact, Brooks said citing a 17-year-old in the programme who was approached by an Islamic State recruiter through Facebook.
The teenager immediately reported it to a member of staff involved in the classes.
For Hala, the classes which they have been attending for right months have made a huge difference to them and their younger siblings.
"My brothers changed. They became much happier," they said.

Kenyans largely ignored an opposition call to go on strike on Monday, re-opening shops and returning to work as they shrugged off demands for demonstrations against President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election and against the killing of protesters.
NAIROBI: Kenyans largely ignored an opposition call to go on strike on Monday, re-opening shops and returning to work as they shrugged off demands for demonstrations against President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election and against the killing of protesters.
Cars, buses and motorcycles returned to the streets of the capital, Nairobi, and the western town of Kisumu after days of inactivity due to fears of violence after last Tuesday's vote, in which Kenyatta beat rival Raila Odinga by securing more than 54 percent of the vote, according to official results.
A Kenyan human rights group said 24 people had been shot dead by police since election day. The government put the number of dead at 10, and said they died "in the course of quelling riots and unlawful assembly". All deaths would be investigated, it added.
Allegations by Odinga of widespread electoral fraud have raised tensions in the East African country, where some 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 displaced in widespread ethnic violence after they lost the 2007 election to Mwai Kibaki.
Relief at the relatively muted protests this time, along with the re-election of a leader seen as pro-business and pro-growth, helped the stock market rise 2.5 percent on Monday. Shares have now climbed nearly 7 percent since the eve of the Aug. 8 election.
In Kibera, Nairobi's biggest slum, where opposition support is strong, many residents appeared to be observing the strike but minibuses wove their way through the rubble-strewn streets, and some food stalls and phone and money outlets had opened.

Ken Nabwere, a Nairobi resident, said they had little choice but to return to work even though they supported the opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition which called the strike.
"I was supposed to vote and (leave) the rest to the politicians because if I was to boycott work today those guys don't pay my bills," they told Reuters. "I would advise others that unless you have permission from your boss, then you better go to work."
"NO WORK, NO FOOD"
Kenya, a country of 45 million people, provides the economic motor of East Africa. International observers said the vote was largely fair and a parallel tally by domestic monitors supported results that showed Kenyatta had won by a margin of 1.4 million votes.
But protests have erupted in opposition-supporting areas of Nairobi and Kisumu, where Odinga has strong support. The Kenya Red Cross said on Monday it had treated 170 people, of whom 108 had serious injuries, since the election.
Kenyatta reiterated an appeal for the opposition to shun violence and take any complaints to court.
"I truly believe there is no single Kenyan anywhere who wants to see violence, looting and demonstrations that end up destroying property," they said.
They also urged police to exercise restraint.
The opposition has ruled out going to court and says it will announce its strategy on Tuesday.
"They should tell people to go back to work and wait for their next move," said university lecturer Samuel Mukoma.
Diplomats have piled pressure on Odinga to either concede or take their challenge to court. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry on Monday offered its congratulations to Kenyatta.
Many in the Kibera quarter of Nairobi were backing NASA'S strike call. "It's only a small portion of people who are working. People need food and money," said 32-year-old community health volunteer Thomas Ogoni.
A small group of young men lit a fire of tires and planks at a busy junction and danced round the flames. Nearby, a dozen women dressed in black and holding candles were sitting in the middle of road in a small peace vigil.
Business activity had largely resumed in Kisumu, with some supermarkets open and motorcycle taxi operators out and about. Civil servants also returned to their desks.
Some opposition supporters said they remained determined to overturn the result but, for many, the priority was earning some money after days of inactivity.
"No work, no food," said Eric Wanjero, a motorcycle driver looking for passengers. "Business is disrupted still but I had to go out (today) and try to make my living."

Retailers were hit by a drastic drop in the number of bargain-hunting shoppers passing through their doors on New Year's Day, figures show.
Shopping centres saw footfall plummet by almost half (49.5%) compared to the same day in 2016, according to research from retail analysts Springboard.
The high streets were also noticeably sparser of customers this year, down 12.7% on the year before, with a 23.8% average decline across all types of retailer.
Bad weather, reduced opening hours and spending sprees at the start of the festive period were all blamed for the dip.
On average, the weekend as a whole saw a drop of 16.1% across high streets, shopping centres and retail parks, the analysis said.
But increased sales poured in over the two days thanks to online shopping, which shot up 6.8% - including 18.2% on New Year's Eve.
High street footfall on New Year's Eve also fell, but less sharply than in 2015, down 2.4% compared with last year's drop of 5.1%
Diane Wehrle, Springboard's insights director, said: "Retailers traditionally see the first trading weekend of the New Year as a sign of things to come, and if this still rings true the industry is set for a rocky 2017.
"The ease and comfort of online shopping proved too enticing for shoppers keen to snap up further discounts in the sales rather than bracing the cold outdoors.
"Shopping centres in particular have a challenge ahead in 2017. Having experienced a decline in footfall during 2016, these destinations need to up their game in order to provide additional reasons to draw shoppers away from their devices with an offer going beyond retail."

A petition for a P120 minimum wage increase will be filed before the office of the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board in Central Visayas (RTWPB – 7) either this afternoon or tomorrow morning by the Associated Labor Unions – Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU – TUCP).
In a press conference today, ALU – TUCP Regional Vice President lawyer Nora Analyn Diego said their proposal covers all employees in Central Visayas.
The current minimum wage in Central Visayas is only P308.34.
“Why P120? To reach with the buying capacity of the current minimum wage of P366. It's P366 not P308,” said Diego.
“We're very confident that the RTWPB will approve our petition. One, because of the effects of TRAIN (Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion) law. Second, we're not making up the figures. It comes from the government,” Diego added.
FILE PHOTO: The logo of Uber is seen on an iPad, during a news conference to announce Uber resumes ride-hailing service, in Taipei, Taiwan April 13, 2017.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ride-services company Uber is facing a divided board of directors and angry shareholders after investor Benchmark Capital filed a lawsuit against the company's ousted chief executive, Travis Kalanick, dealing another blow to the firm as it struggles to recover from a series of scandals and hire a new leader.
On Friday morning, three Uber investors asked Benchmark to divest its shares and step down from Uber Technologies Inc's board, according to an email published by news website Axios and confirmed by Reuters.
Also on Friday, members of the board of directors sent an email to Uber staff expressing dismay over the Benchmark lawsuit, according to a copy of the note obtained by Reuters.
"The Board of Directors is disappointed that a disagreement between shareholders has resulted in litigation," the directors wrote. "The Board has urged both parties to resolve the matter cooperatively and quickly, and the Board is taking steps to facilitate that process."
Benchmark, in its lawsuit filed on Thursday, is seeking to force Kalanick off the board, and accuses them of concealing a range of misdeeds and scheming to retain power at the company even after they were forced to resign as chief executive in June.
Benchmark was among the Uber investors in June who pressed Kalanick to step down after a string of setbacks.
Investors Shervin Pishevar of Sherpa Capital, Ron Burkle of Yucaipa Companies and Adam Leber, an angel investor who works for music company Maverick, on Friday wrote an email to shareholders and board members calling for Benchmark to remove itself from the company board and divest enough of its shares so that it would no longer have the right to appoint other board seats.
"We have investors ready to acquire these shares as soon as we receive communication from Benchmark that they are willing to withdraw their lawsuit and sell a minimum of 75 percent of their holdings," the email said, according to Axios.
Reuters confirmed the email with a source close to one of the investors. The three investors and Benchmark could not be reached for comment.
The division and hostility emerging among Uber investors and directors opens a new front in a highly unusual public battle for Silicon Valley. It is rare for a venture firm to sue the central figure of a valuable portfolio company, and equally unexpected for investors to make a counter-move to push out a fellow investor backing the same company.
Pishevar, Burkle and Leber -- who are not members of the board of directors -- said Benchmark's lawsuit harms Uber's valuation, interferes with fundraising efforts and impedes the company's search for a new CEO to replace Kalanick.
Benchmark's tactics are "ethically dubious and, critically, value-destructive rather than value enhancing," the investors wrote in the email, according to Axios.
The email from the board of directions was signed by Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Ryan Graves, Arianna Huffington, Wan Ling Martello and David Trujillo. Missing were the signatures of Kalanick and Benchmark board member Matt Cohler. It assured staff that there were "several outstanding candidates" for the CEO job.
One Uber investor told Reuters that Kalanick's continued role at the company has complicated the CEO search and scared off some good candidates.
HONG KONG: The dollar extended gains and most Asian markets resumed their rally on Wednesday (Feb 15) as traders cheered upbeat remarks on the US economy by Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen.
Wall Street hit record highs for a fourth successive day as Yellen reinforced the view that the world's top economy was in rude health, with the jobs market improving and inflation heading to the Fed's 2 per cent target.
They confirmed the next rate rise could come at any time, which leaves open the possibility of a move at the Fed's Mar 14 to 15 policy meeting.
I remarks, in the first of two days of testimony to Congress, helped drag US markets out of a morning slumber and reinvigorated the greenback against most of its peers.
"The US dollar was on the back foot during the Asian trade (Tuesday), but it got that boost from Yellen, so it will be on a stronger position (Wednesday)," said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader.
"She said rates need to rise. That's important because to wait is to risk having to overreact and then knock the economy - and markets - for six."
In Tokyo the dollar was at 114.35 yen from 114.27 yen in New York and well up from the 113.40 yen earlier in Asia. The pound and euro were sharply down from their levels in Asia Tuesday.
Higher-risk currencies retreated, with Australia's dollar, the South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and New Zealand dollar all well down.
"TRUMP RALLY CONTINUES"
Equity markets tracked the US surge. Tokyo shot up 1 per cent as the weaker yen helped exporters, while Hong Kong added 1.2 per cent.
Sydney ended up 0.9 per cent, Seoul gained 0.5 per cent and Singapore was up 0.5 per cent. Wellington and Taipei also advanced. However, Shanghai gave up earlier strength to close 0.2 per cent lower.
The broad advance extends a rally that began last week when President Donald Trump promised details of "phenomenal" tax reforms, raising hopes they will also honour other election promises of massive infrastructure spending and deregulation.
"In principle, the Trump rally continues," said Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities.
"Yellen seemed so positive" towards hiking interest rates, they told AFP.
In Tokyo, however, troubled conglomerate Toshiba plunged almost 9 per cent - extending Tuesday's 8 per cent decline - after warning it faced a 390 billion yen loss in the fiscal year to March, hit by a 700 billion yen writedown at its US nuclear unit Westinghouse.
The news prompted its chairperson to resign while it also hinted at another accounting scandal following a profit-padding crisis in 2015.
In early European trade London rose 0.4 per cent, Frankfurt added 0.5 per cent and Paris gained 0.3 per cent.

While swimming Masters, I introduced myself to a fellow swimmer and learned they had a four- and six-year-old in learn-to-swim and the youngest group on our club team. I told her, “You're going to have so much fun in the years ahead. Enjoy it!”
I felt a tinge of jealousy along with a flash of memories driving to meet in the early mornings with my kids, laughing with other parents in the stands, and watching my kids dive off the blocks earning a long sought-after cut. My years as a swim parent are closing, while this swim mom has years of exciting times ahead. They told me that their son insists on going to practice every single day. I told them my daughter is like that, too, and that's wonderful. We can't force them to love swimming.
Here are a few things I'd suggest to a new swim parent:
One
Passion for the sport
You cannot make your children love the sport. Children want to please us and they will try to swim if it's important to us, but if it's not their passion, it's tough to stick with it. We cannot want swimming more than they do. If they aren't passionate about swimming, let them explore something else they may love more.
Two
Stay away from drama
At some point, you'll see some problems erupt between kids or parents. You may notice some people who are negative and have nothing positive to say about your team, coach or other parents. Stay away from negativity and drama and you'll be a happier swim parent.
Three
Encourage your swimmer
We can encourage our kids by getting them to the pool consistently, cheering for them and volunteering. We can ask simple questions about how practice is going and how they felt during a race. We can be good listeners and enjoy hearing about their experiences.
Four
Allow them ownership
We can't swim for our kids or put in the effort day in and day out. Our kids are the ones who are putting in the hard work. They will learn so many lessons when they take responsibility for what they do on a daily basis in and out of the pool.
Five
Six simple words
I've seen parents visibly upset when their kids don't do well and even yell and pull their swimmers out of meets. If children love swimming, surely this isn't the way to get them to continue to enjoy it. The best advice I've heard is to say six simple words and see how it works with your kids: “I love to watch you swim.”
What advice would you share with a new swim parent?
Elizabeth Wickham volunteered for 14 years on their kids' club team as board member, fundraiser, newsletter editor and “Mrs. meet manager.” She's a writer with a bachelor of arts degree in editorial journalism from the University of Washington with a long career in public relations, marketing and advertising. Them stories have appeared in newspapers and magazines including the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Parenting and Ladybug. You can read more parenting tips on their blog.
“There's an energy and an optimism that those kids bring with them when they are performing,” Neisser said. “Life in those townships is not easy … but you do not get that bleakness when you are with those kids.”
Joey Barton has rejoined Burnley on a deal until the end of the season, the Premier League club have announced.
The Clarets recently agreed a deal in principle for the midfielder to sign for them in the January transfer window.
The issue had been complicated by a Football Association probe into alleged betting, with Barton facing a possible fine and suspension after being charged for allegedly placing 1,260 bets over a 10-year period.
But Burnley announced shortly after Monday's 2-1 loss at Manchester City that Barton's return to the Turf Moor outfit had been finalised.
The Clarets also revealed the one-match suspension Barton - who left Burnley to join Rangers over the summer - was handed in November by the Scottish Football Association for breaching betting regulations has now been served.
A statement from the Premier League club read: "Burnley Football Club can confirm that following detailed discussions regarding the recent FA charge brought against Joey Barton, the club have now reached an agreement with the player and their representatives over a contract with the club until the end of the season.
"Barton becomes available for selection from January 3 after completing their registration in time to serve a one match suspension against Manchester City, as a result of a carry-over suspension passed down from the Scottish FA relating to a previous offence."
Burnley's next match is Saturday's FA Cup third round tie at Sunderland.
Barton, who has until Thursday to respond to the English FA's charge, helped Burnley win the Championship title last term.
And after a short and ill-fated spell north of the border, the 34-year-old then started training with the club again in November.

With a first-round score of 335, the Eastern women's golf team is currently in ninth at the Ohio Valley Conference Championship in Owens Cross Roads, Ala.
The OVC Championship is a three day 54-hole tournament on the par 72 Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail. Leading the way for the Panthers are juniors Anne Bahr and Hannah Magda. Bahr is tied for 27th with a score of 79 and Magda is 34th with an 82 score.
Since the Panthers are currently ninth and in last, the team needs to remain positive in order to improve their ranking. Bahr said the Panthers' spirits are not low by any means and after day one, everybody is anxious to improve during tomorrow's round.
“I think we all know what we need to change for tomorrow,” Bahr said. “And it seems like we already have the mentality of wanting to attack the course tomorrow.”
Over the next two days, Bahr would like to finish the championship in the top-15, they said.
As the round came to an end, the Panthers struggled on some of the later holes. Senior Alexandra Pickens, who is tied for 39th with an 86, said the team shot well on the first nine holes, but finishing strong was the problem for the Panthers.
“Our goal is to finish strong,” Pickens said. “Everyone had a good nine hole score, we just need to stay with it for the other 9. For most of us, that was what the problem was.”
Pickens was not the only golfer who believed the Panthers struggled on the later holes. Bahr said this is not the first time those finishing holes have given the Panthers problems.
“I can't think of a specific one in general, but the finishing holes at this course are pretty tough,” Bahr said. “Sixteen, 17, and 18 have always given us problems in the past, especially 16 and 17. Hopefully we get revenge on some holes that caused us problems today.”
Finishing off the five Panther golfers are seniors Chloe Wong and Madison Burgett. Wong holds the 42nd place with an 88 and right behind them in 43rd is Burgett with a score of 91.
Eastern Kentucky and Murray State are tied for first place with a team score of 286, 2 under par. Individually, sophomores Elsa Moberly from Eastern Kentucky and Linette Holmslykke from Murray State are tied for first with a score of 68.

After stints as a gangsta, a rasta, a Martha Stewart cooking show co-host and youth football mogul, now Snoop Dogg is heading to church for their new album.
The Long Beach rap legend has spilled some details about their upcoming gospel-themed LP, “Bible of Love,” which they described on Beats 1 as a sound that's “always been on my heart. I just never got around to it because I always be doing gangsta business or doing this or doing that.”
SINGAPORE: Private property developers saw stronger sales in January despite the lack of new project launches, figures released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Wednesday (Feb 15) showed.
Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), 381 new private homes were sold last month, up 17.6 per cent from the 324 sold in January last year. Including ECs, 565 units were sold, up from the 480 sold in the same period a year ago.
Compared to December – a traditionally quiet month for property transactions – sales excluding ECs were up 3.8 per cent.
Property developers launched 108 new homes in January, down from the 159 units launched in January last year. The bulk of the units were from The Glades in Bedok Rise, which launched the remaining 76 homes in the 726-unit development.
BANGKOK: A major Laos drug lord dubbed "Mr X" was jailed for life on Tuesday (Mar 20) by a Bangkok court, as Thailand battles record meth trafficking through its borders.
Xaysana Keopimpha, a swaggering Laotian who before their arrest paraded their celebrity links and penchant for sports cars on social media, was picked up at Bangkok's main airport in January last year.
They were accused of being a kingpin in a meth smuggling ring that funnelled tonnes of Myanmar made "yaba" pills and ice - crystal meth - through Communist Laos and into Thailand.
The Laos route south is increasingly used by trafficking gangs keen to reach markets in Thailand, Malaysia and as far as Australia and Japan - where the price of the drug steepens.
A Bangkok court initially handed Xaysana the death penalty but reduced it to life imprisonment after they admitted several charges of drug smuggling, including over 1.2 million yaba pills in a case dating back to 2016.
"Due to their confession during the investigation process, the court decreases their sentence to life imprisonment," a Criminal Court judge said in their ruling.

Evidence pulled from mobile phones linked Xaysana with a smuggling network that used Nong Khai, the Thai border point with Laos, to move drugs south, the judge added.
Standing handcuffed in their prison uniform, Xaysana did not react as the verdict was delivered.
Details of Xaysana's colourful life unspooled after their arrest last year.
Investigators say they boasted a contacts book stuffed with the rich and powerful, including Thai celebrities, who may have helped shield their narcotics cartel.
According to Thai police, Bangkok and its surrounding suburbs offered crucial hideaways and protection for the drug syndicate, with high-end car dealers and celebrities helping to launder Xaysana's profits.
They allegedly helped move drugs manufactured in the "Golden Triangle" - a lawless border region where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar all meet.
Rampant corruption across the zone has allowed the drug trade to flourish.
Record amounts of yaba and the more addictive ice are being seized by Thai police.
But drug experts say the seizures are as much a sign of surging production as improved police work given cartels have easily been able to make up for confiscations and there has been no palpable increase in street prices.
In January a Thai naval patrol seized 11 million meth pills from traffickers using the Mekong River to move drugs Laos into Thailand.
Cops said estimated the haul to have a street value of up to US$100 million - with yaba pills worth up to US$10 a pop in parts of Southeast Asia.
Laos' opaque authoritarian communist regime has also turned the insular country into a sanctuary for both drug and wildlife traffickers fleeing more aggressive policing in Thailand.
The highest quality yaba pills (15 to 20 per cent meth purity) come from the factories of the North and South Wa - armed ethnic groups in a self-governing state on the Myanmar-China border - and by the Lahu hill tribe.
John Mayer is obsessed with himself.
The 'Free Fallin' hitmaker has confessed that they are "self-centered" but insists they don't think everything they do is great.
They said: "Well, like, I'm about myself, I'm self-centered, but I don't think everything I do is great. But I think about everything I do all of the time. More, all the time. All I do is think about what I do. Horrible, it's a horrible existence."
The 39-year-old singer credits music for helping to give them some sort of peace.
They added: "But then I'll go in the studio, and I'll come back and listen and I'll go, 'Oh, that is a great drumbeat. Listen to that guitar tone.

The Trump administration is unlikely to meet its self-declared August deadline for enacting tax reform, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday. That will make it more difficult for companies to factor any changes into their spending decisions for next year.
The failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, threw off a timetable that even Mnuchin had admitted was ambitious for the complex task of overhauling the tax code, they told the Financial Times.
“It started as [an] aggressive timeline,” Mnuchin said. “It is fair to say it is probably delayed a bit because of the healthcare” debate.
Mnuchin said Monday that they still expected tax reform to be enacted this year.
Shortly after taking office in February, Mnuchin said the administration wanted to pass major tax legislation by the time Congress left for its August recess. But they said at the time that the effort “could slip to later this year.”
Enacting tax reform, including a cut in the corporate tax rate, by August would have allowed businesses to take the changes — particularly expected lower tax rates — into account as they planned for 2018.
Congress also works better when facing a recess deadline, so failure to enact the legislation by August means it might not happen until sometime in the fall — if at all.
It's possible tax reform efforts could fail, as did the attempt to replace Obama's healthcare law. Or an overhaul of the tax system could take much longer than anticipated. The last major tax changes, in the 1980s, took more than two years to enact.
The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are still drafting their tax proposals. And the House Republican push for a controversial border-adjustment tax looms as a major sticking point.
The tax, which would subject importers to higher taxes than exporters or those that produce products in the U.S. for domestic consumption, could raise $1 trillion in revenue over 10 years. The money would help offset a sharp reduction in the 35% corporate tax rate.
But the border-adjustment tax has split the business community. Major exporters want it. But retailers that import a lot of goods, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., oppose it.
Mnuchin said Monday that Treasury officials were still studying the border-adjustment tax, but that there might be other ways to raise the $1 trillion in revenue.
“That is not to say we have taken it off the table,” Mnuchin said.
The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are trying to craft a tax overhaul without increasing the deficit. Mnuchin said that stronger economic growth triggered by an overhaul could help offset projections of lost revenues from lower rates.
“Economic growth creates lots of revenues,” they said. “When you calculate whether it is deficit-neutral or not, there are a bunch of different calculations and a bunch of models. I am just pointing out the magnitude of what economic growth does.”

Former UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar, who is currently suspended from competition, has informed the promotion their professional fighting career is over.
UFC officials confirmed the news to ESPN.com on Tuesday, following an initial report by MMAFighting.com.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) also confirmed it was aware of Lesnar's retirement. Due to the retirement, Lesnar is no longer included in USADA's testing pool, under the UFC's anti-doping program.

Last month, Lesnar, 39, was handed a one-year suspension from USADA due to a pair of failed drug tests in 2016. The Nevada State Athletic Commission also suspended Lesnar for one year. The suspensions do not affect their professional wrestling career in WWE.
Lesnar would have been eligible to return to active competition in July, but their USADA suspension freezes with this announcement. Should Lesnar (5-3) opt to resume their UFC career at any point, they would be required to fulfill the remaining five months of that suspension.
Lesnar has not commented publicly on their retirement.
A former NCAA Division I national champion wrestler, Lesnar came out of a nearly five-year retirement to face Mark Hunt at UFC 200 last July in Las Vegas. Lesnar won the fight via unanimous decision, but it was later changed to a no-contest after the positive tests were revealed.
Lesnar tested positive for the anti-estrogenic substance clomiphene. They denied knowingly taking the banned substance.
: The Shiromani Akali Dal on Sunday attacked Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, saying they should "talk less and deliver more", a day after they accused the SAD-BJP regime of framing "toothless" law on outdoor advertising and causing "revenue leakage".The opposition party also asked them to elaborate about their contributions made to the state after becoming a minister, except flagging off fire tenders.Former minister and SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, in a statement, said, "Today we have learnt of your latest dream that the state lost heavily in outdoor advertising during the last five-year of the SAD-BJP rule. We are looking forward to seeing how you will earn this so-called lost money for the state.He said that you should earn Rs 75 crore through the outdoor advertising in the next three months to prove your point."If you are unable to do that, then seek an apology from Punjabis for trying to be-fool them with false statements and cheap theatrics," the former education minister said.Sidhu, they said, seemed to have been "stricken by an Akali phobia" and claimed that it was because of this they were "hell bent" on reversing the every positive step taken by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government."Sidhu has stopped the BRTS project which was undertaken to decongest Amritsar. The project has been scrapped by them despite the fact that 15 of the 93 buses purchased for the project had already started running."Earlier, Sidhu scrapped the amphibious water bus project at Harike Pattan which was designed to put the wetland on the international tourist circuit," they alleged.Asking Sidhu not to let their "hatred" for the SAD come in the way of the state's development, Cheema said Sidhu should realise that they had been given a mandate to serve the people, not to discriminate against them."Governance is not a comedy circus where you will make a few guffaws and laugh off everything. Here you will have to deliver on your words. Five months have already passed. You have not made a single contribution to the state."Your one single act of flagging off fire riders also led to embarrassment for the government with the tenders breaking down after travelling a few meters after inauguration," they said, taking a dig at the minister.Sidhu, the local government minister, yesterday hit out at the Akalis for allegedly "looting" the state by facilitating individuals in outdoor advertisement and cable businesses.He had also alleged the previous SAD-BJP regime for "revenue leakage" by framing "toothless" law pertaining to outdoor advertising.

CLARENCE, N.Y. (WIVB) — A two-year-old boy was run over by a vehicle in Clarence Sunday morning.
New York State Police say that the child was with their family at Antique World. While there, authorities say they ran out of a storage garage and display area, and into the path of a pickup truck.
The truck, which was being driven by a 50-year-old Clarence man, ran over the boy's legs and pelvis, but their injuries were non-life threatening.
The child was subsequently taken to Women & Children's Hospital to undergo surgery.
The driver was not charged.
The Manitoba government has introduced legislation that will see harsher penalties for distracted drivers.
The Conservative government officially introduced a bill Monday that calls for a three-day licence suspension for first time offenders caught using their phones while driving and a seven-day suspension the second time.
Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said there will be a grace period.
“You will get a temporary license to get your vehicle home and then your three day suspension will kick in,” they said.

Len Eastoe fights tickets through their business the Traffic Ticket Experts. They said the changes are unfair.
“The immediate suspension means you're putting a penalty in place before a person's even been found guilty. You've suspended them for three days, it's done,” they said.
“You take away our system because the system is you get to go before court and the evidence has to come out in front of an adjudicator. Here we make the police officer the witness, the judge, the jury and decides the penalty.”

Last year there were 6,165 people charged with distracted driving, for using their cell phones or other hand-operated electronic devices.
Crashes caused by distracted drivers have been on the rise in the province. Data from Manitoba Public Insurance shows that between 2011 and 2016 the number of crashes rose from 2,415 to 11,086.

Right now distracted drivers are also slapped with five demerits and a $204 ticket. That fine is also under review.
The province isn't just targeting cell phone users, it also plans to make careless driving a serious driving offence, which could lead to a license suspension and two demerit points.
A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Congress leaders of having a "secret meeting" at Mani Shankar Aiyar's residence, alleged that Pakistan was interfering in Gujarat Assembly elections and asked why former prime minister Manmohan Singh did not "show the courage to order a surgical strike post the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, despite the readiness of the army", Singh released a statement responding to Modi.

Here is the full text of Singh's statement:
“I am deeply pained and anguished by the falsehood and canards being spread to score political points in a lost cause by none less than Prime Minister, Sh. Narender Modi. Fearing imminent defeat in Gujarat, desperation of Prime Minister to hurl every abuse and latch on to every straw is palpable. Sadly & regrettably, Sh. Modi is setting a dangerous precedent by their insatiable desire to tarnish every constitutional office, including that of a Former Prime Minister and Army Chief.
The Congress Party needs no sermons on “Nationalism” from a party and Prime Minister, whose compromised track record on fighting terrorism is well known. Let me remind Sh. Narender Modi that they had gone to Pakistan uninvited after the terrorist attacks in Udhampur and Gurdaspur. Let them also tell the country the reason for inviting the infamous ISI of Pakistan to our strategic Air Base in Pathankot to investigate a terror attack that emanated from Pakistan.
My track record of public service to the country over last five decades is known to everyone. No one, including Sh. Modi, can lamely question it to gain lost political ground.
I reject the innuendos and falsehoods as I did not discuss Gujarat elections with anyone else at the dinner hosted by Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar as alleged by Shri Modi. Nor was the Gujarat issue raised by anyone else present at the dinner. The discussion was confined to India-Pakistan relations. Names of the distinguished Indian public servants and journalists present at the dinner are enclosed to this statement. None of them could be accused of indulging in any anti-national activities.
I sincerely hope that they will apologize to the Nation for their ill-thought transgression to restore the dignity of the office they occupy.”

NEW YORK: A Bangladeshi man set off a homemade pipe bomb strapped to their body in a crowded New York City commuter hub during the morning rush hour on Monday, officials said, immediately calling it an attempted terrorist attack.
The suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, was taken to a hospital after suffering burns from the explosive device, which was attached to their body with Velcro and zip ties and did not fully ignite, officials said. Investigators told Reuters they believe the attack in midtown Manhattan was intended to be a suicide bombing.
The blast, which occurred around 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) in a busy underground passageway between the subway station underneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square subway station, sent commuters fleeing for the exits and police officers rushing to the scene, as officials scrambled to reroute trains and shut down streets.
Three people, including a police officer, suffered minor injuries.
The attack came just six weeks after police say an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, ploughed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians along a bike path in lower Manhattan, killing eight in an act for which Islamic State later claimed responsibility. In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when they set off a homemade bomb in New York's Chelsea neighbourhood.
In recent years, numerous people claiming to be inspired by Islamic State have carried out attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States.

A law enforcement official familiar with the Ullah investigation said investigators have found evidence that they watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet.
'AMATEUR-LEVEL'
The weapon used in Monday's attack was "amateur-level," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference near the explosion site. They told CNN the homemade bomb may not have fully ignited, possibly limiting the damage.
Officials said the attempted bombing underscored New York City's status as a target for such attacks, citing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people in all, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.
"Let's be clear, as New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways," Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. "And let's also be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack."
In a statement, President Donald Trump said the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.
"America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country," they said.
The president also criticized the visa programme that allowed Ullah to enter the United States in 2011 because they had family members already in the country, saying such family visas are "incompatible with national security."
Authorities did not immediately comment on Ullah's motives. When asked whether Ullah had claimed any connection to Islamic State, New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill said, "He did make statements but we're not going to talk about that right now."
Several U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no immediate information indicating Ullah was previously known to any American spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militants or terrorism, though a connection could still be found.
Ullah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country's police chief. They had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.
Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver's licence from 2012 to 2015, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.
Monday's incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in a long tunnel that connects sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on their torso.
'EVERYBODY WAS SCARED'
The explosion turned a normal start to the work week into a chaotic scene.
"There was a stampede up the stairs to get out," said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. "Everybody was scared and running and shouting."
The bus terminal was temporarily closed, and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway travel was disrupted but later returned to normal.
In December, New York experiences a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store window displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows.
More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city's busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Ten train lines stop at the station.
The bus terminal is the busiest in the United States, according to the Port Authority. On a typical weekday, about 220,000 passengers arrive or depart on more than 7,000 buses.
The bus terminal is adjacent to and above the subway station's western section. A long, narrow underground tunnel connects that part of the station to its eastern section, and is used by thousands of commuters during rush hour.
The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening stock markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries.
Technology and energy stocks closed higher Monday, helping Wall Street shake off uncertainties following the explosion.

President Trump signed legislation Wednesday to give terminally ill patients the ability to access experimental drugs that have not won approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
The "right to try" measure will let patients who have exhausted other options access drugs in early stages of FDA review. Trump has frequently noted their support for the idea, most recently during their State of the Union address in January.
"For countless patients, time is not what they have," the president said. "With the right to try, patients with life-threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions."
Trump has sought several changes in FDA policy this year, most of which have been aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs or speeding their review. Hinting at the possibility of another announcement, Trump said that pharmaceutical companies would announce a “voluntary, massive” reduction in prices in coming weeks.
The "right to try" legislation gives terminally ill patients the ability to access drugs that have cleared the initial phase of review but have not been fully cleared by the FDA. The House approved a Senate-passed bill earlier this month on a mostly party-line vote.
Supporters said the measure gives a lifeline to patients who don't have another option. Opponents are concerned about cutting the FDA out of the process and have questioned whether it would, in fact, give patients greater access to experimental drugs.
As the House and Senate negotiated different versions of the bill, Trump said they called on lawmakers to focus on the proposal that would have the most benefit for “the people,” not insurers and drug manufacturers.

SANTOS, Brazil: Twenty years ago, a coach named Betinho was watching a game of beach football when they spotted a skinny boy of six sprinting up and down the terracing, faster than he'd ever seen someone of that age. It was Neymar.
The boy, who would one day turn into the world's most expensive footballer, dashed around that afternoon in 1998 near Santos, south of São Paulo, under the eye of their mother. Their father, a recently retired professional right-back, played in an amateur game on the sand.

The experienced Betinho took it all in.
"This is how I saw it," Betinho, 60, told AFP in the small town of Sao Vicente, where they still live, not far from the beach where they struck footballing gold.
"The father plays well, the mother is tall, so if the boy turns out thin like her, and with their father's game, it will work."
Betinho knew what they were talking about.

Eight years earlier he'd discovered Robinho, who would go on to shine at Pele's old club Santos, then play for Real Madrid, Manchester City, AC Milan and in two World Cups with Brazil.
What Betinho didn't know was that he'd just spotted someone even better.
Approaching the parents, they asked if they could take the kid they called "Juninho" - the diminutive of Junior, which is how relatives still call the star - to train with the area futsal team, Gremetal. They agreed.
"All my career I wanted to find a player who could summon up the spirit of Pele. Lightening struck twice for me," Betinho said.
100 PER CENT JESUS
Betinho and Neymar stuck together in a journey that led from club to club before the prodigy was signed up to Santos Football Club's training programme at the age of 11.
The slender, skilled dribbler's reputation preceded him.
"We already knew who Neymar was. They were already taking care of them as if they were a future great," said their friend Pedro Lopes at Gremetal, where they first met 16 years ago.
Neymar was only nine when they arrived, but after just two training sessions they were moved up an age category.
"In most of our games, we'd pass the ball to them and wait for them to dribble through half the opposing team," Lopes says.

Lopes and Neymar became close both on the pitch and in school, but although Neymar was a good student, their destiny was already in motion.
"He had innate talent, which has been honed with time, especially in the team aspect of the game, because they were always someone very hungry for the ball. They wanted to get the ball, to dribble past everyone," said the Gremetal coach, Alcides Magri.
It was at Gremetal that Neymar got their first title, starting a streak that would later include a Champions League, Copa Libertadores and Olympic gold. It was also at Gremetal that they began their tradition of celebrating cup wins by wrapping on a headband given to them by their devout Evangelical Christian mother, reading: "100 per cent Jesus."
HIGH LIFE
To fans, Neymar has often come across as a spoiled playboy, never happier than when showing off their latest tattoo on Instagram.
But those who know them from the start say the star is playful and joyful, if not always understood by others.
"He's someone with incredible energy, happiness, an extrovert who always feels good about life. When I'm down, I try to get close to them because they transmit huge positivity," Lopes said.
With their dyed hair, tatoos and similar love of Instagram, Lopes fits right in with Neymar's band of friends who call themselves the "Tois." The gang rallied around the Paris Saint-Germain forward when they flew home for surgery on a broken foot bone in February.
"When they suffered the sadness of that injury, they turned to their family for comfort, to raise their self-esteem and to recuperate as quickly as possible," Lopes said.
One of Neymar's morale-boosting requests was for Lopes to bring them a Gremetal shirt to put in their collection.
It was a moment of nostalgia. But as their discoverer Betinho says, Neymar's roots are already far behind.
"I spent six years looking after him, which is a long time. But now he's part of the world."

Vernon residents are upset with number of needles being found around town with spring melt
An abundance of needles springing up around Vernon, B.C. has the public outraged with safety concerns.
The snow melt is revealing discarded needles in various locations around town – including Anderson Way, near the Civic Arena and walking trails around town.
And it's not just Vernon.
“Last time I was in Vernon at a school playground with my daughter we found needles littered around the school yard. It is a terrifying site when you have little ones playing near this trash,” said Zachary Linderman. “I hope a solution is found for the small group of people doing this!”
See related: Needles found at school
According to Interior Health: “Anyone using a needle to inject should dispose of it safely. However, that's not always the case, and sometimes discarded needles and drug paraphernalia are found in public areas.”
Therefore those who are cleaning up needles are urged to use safe needle disposal.
– Do not try to replace the cap on the needle, snap, break or bend the needle.
– Pick up needle using work or latex gloves and tongs or tweezers, holding needle point away from you.
– Put the needle in a metal or hard plastic container that has a lid, such as a product or drink bottle.
– Replace cap on container firmly and label it.
– Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
– Drop off the sealed container at your local health unit or at a community drop box.
The city of Vernon recently released an warning about debris being uncovered with spring melt.

When I first read The Bell Jar, I was shocked to discover that it is not, in fact, a huge bummer of a book. I'd been hoping for the sort of terrifically sad book that I could read while sobbing in the bathtub. But that wasn't what I got (although I did still read it in the bathtub, out of principle). The Bell Jar is witty. It's real. It's harrowing too, of course, as it chronicles young Esther Greenwood's struggle with depression and soul-crushing summer internships. It's not a book that romanticizes mental illness, though. It doesn't glamorize sadness. The Bell Jar shows us immense pain, but it also shows us recovery. It's ultimately hopeful. And yet we're always quoting it out of context.
Sylvia Plath, after all, is known for their death as much as for their writing. The fact that they eventually died by suicide has all but overshadowed their life. This problem doesn't seem to affect male authors nearly as much—Ernest Hemingway also died by suicide, but we rarely roll our eyes at A Farewell to Arms as a sad book fit only for sad teenage girls. And yet, Plath has been saddled with the reputation of being "too depressing, guys, too depressing," as one two-star review on Goodreads put it.
Which brings me to the "fig tree" quote.
The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, $13.19, Amazon
I read the quote long before ever reading The Bell Jar. You, too, may have come across the "fig tree" somewhere on the great wide web, or on the TV show Master of None. It goes like this:
"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."
Nearly every young person can relate to the fig tree: that horrible, suffocating feeling of indecision, the sense that every choice you make for the future means giving up on ten other choices. The knowledge that you can only move forward, and that if you choose the wrong "fig," the right fig might fall and rot before you get to it.
There's nothing necessarily wrong with plucking this quote out of The Bell Jar — in many ways, it captures the crux of Esther's depression in a single paragraph. They feel inadequate, paralyzed by indecision, and unsure of what they want. She's starving to death and yet unable to reach out and pluck a fig, any fig, from their tree. They can see future happiness, but doesn't know how to grasp it. She's numb to their own life. There's a reason that this quote resonates with so many people.
But people rarely seem to quote the page after the fig tree.
Esther has this disturbing vision while out on a date with Constantin, who's giving them a tour of the U.N. Being surrounded by all these accomplished, multilingual young people prompt Esther to start mentally listing all the things she's terrible at. They berate themselves on their own flaws (she can't cook, they don't know shorthand, she's a bad dancer) until they spiral into the fig tree metaphor, sure that they will never live up to their promise as a gifted, scholarship kid.
Then, however, Constantin takes them to a restaurant, and Esther has to sit down and eat. Then, there's this:
"I don't know what I ate, but I felt immensely better after the first mouthful. It occurred to me that my vision of the fig tree and all the fat figs that withered and fell to earth might well have arisen from the profound void of an empty stomach."
They were hungry.
Of course, that doesn't mean that the fig tree wasn't a genuine expression of their fears, or that a single sandwich has cured Esther of all their emotional anguish — but it's an important moment all the same. Plath isn't presenting us with a withering fig tree as the inevitable end to all young people with promise. She's showing us a young woman in great pain, who sometimes forgets to do things like eat. Esther's fears are valid, but the book is not about them succumbing to fear. It's about them slowly, steadily finding their feet again, one sandwich at a time.
The fig tree is an apt image for all those moments of indecisive panic. It's a good quote. But there are so many other metaphors in The Bell Jar that so rarely get quoted. Esther is often told that, in relationships, the man is the arrow and the woman is "the place the arrow shoots from." Six pages after the fig tree quote, they think to herself:
"The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket."
And then, of course, there's the very end of the book, when Esther leaves the hospital, excited at the prospect of meeting their own future:
"My stocking seams were straight, my black shoes cracked, but polished, and my red wool suit flamboyant as my plans. Something old, something new... But I wasn't getting married. There ought, I thought, to be a ritual for being born twice—patched, retreaded and approved for the road..."
Because no matter how Sylvia Plath's own life may have ended, Esther will not starve to death in the crotch of the fig tree.

Boyne City Police continue to investigate the vandalism and threatening message found at Boyne City High School last week.
According to Boyne City Police Chief Jeff Gaither, their department has interviewed numerous individuals but there are still no persons of interest.

REUTERS: U.S. computer maker Dell Technologies Inc and business software provider VMware Inc have decided to explore options that could include a potential merger of the two companies, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The move, which may not result in any deal, comes as Dell, the world's largest privately held technology company, seeks new avenues for growth following its debt-laden acquisition of data storage provider EMC Corp for US$67 billion in 2016.
Dell plans to announce as early as Friday that it will review a possible reverse merger with VMware, as well as other alternatives, including an initial public offering or asset divestitures, the three sources said.
VMware plans to announce that it will form a special committee of board directors to consider a combination with Dell, according to the sources. VMware is 80 percent-owned by Dell, so the special committee is aimed at making any combination subject to approval by disinterested directors who will safeguard the interests of VMware minority shareholders, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dell declined to comment, while VMWare did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dell is under pressure to boost its profitability after the EMC deal failed to deliver the cost savings and performance it projected, while higher component costs and a challenging data storage market have eroded its margins.

The Round Rock, Texas-based company has struggled with fierce competition in the storage market, as cloud-based rivals such as Amazon.com Inc's AWS and Microsoft Corp's Azure put pressure on prices. Dell's infrastructure chief, former EMC executive David Goulden, departed last fall, and the firm has since been working to reorganize its storage operations.
The PC market, which Dell CEO Michael Dell helped shape by founding Dell in 1984 as a college first-year student with US$1,000 in savings, has remained stagnant due to the popularity of smart phones and tablets, shrinking by 0.2 percent in 2017, according to International Data Corporation.
A reverse merger would see VMware, which has a market capitalization of US$51 billion, buy Dell, rather than Dell buy the minority stake in VMware it does not already own. A lockup provision prevents Dell from buying out VMware until September.
"Irrespective of whether VMware or Dell is the acquirer, we think the terms of trade would have to entail a premium to VMware minority shareholders," UBS Securities LLC desk-based analyst Evren Ergin wrote in a sales commentary note on Thursday.
Another consideration for Dell in its deliberations is offering an eventual path to private equity firm Silver Lake to cash out on its investment in the company. Silver Lake helped bankroll Michael Dell's US$24.9 billion deal in 2013 to take the company private and owns about 18 percent of the company.

MIRPUR (AJK) - The AJK government has approved the construction of a grand Rs35 million multi-storey academic block for the Govt Post Graduate College, Mirpur.
It was a result of the recent untiring efforts of the recently-formed Old Saroshians' Association – the organisation of Old Students of Govt Post Graduate College, Mirpur. This was disclosed here at a special ceremony held at the college hall on Tuesday. The special ceremony was hosted to mark the handing over of worth Rs50,000 books to the college management gifted by an old student of the college.
The ceremony was attended by a large number of the students, old students, academic staff and senior journalists.
The AJK government has placed Rs10 million for the new academic block in the new fiscal year budget at the first leg of the uplift of the first historic Mirpur Govt. College in the Southern region of the Jammu Kashmir state established in 1944 during the toppled dogra regime.
The union president underlined that the gigantic project of extension of the college was moved to the government in view of the acute shortage of classrooms – which are presently available for only up to 1,200 students. Rest of the students of the total capacity of 3,700, have to adopt alternative ordinary means including in the residential quarters of the teaching staff in the college premises, which have so far been vacated from the teachers to convert them into the alternative classrooms, they added.
Iqbal Ratayal said that the association had also moved to the government for early establishment of a digital library and the provision of giant high-power electricity generator for the college to maintain the uninterrupted power supply to the classrooms.
College Principal Prof Nazar Hussain highlighted the future activities of the Old Saroshians' Union with the coordination of the college management for the promotion of quality education.

Last Tuesday was the fourth anniversary of the beginning of the demonstration that turned into a revolution in Ukraine. To mark the occasion, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko visited the Maidan, the central square where much of the drama played out back in late 2013 and early 2014. Together with the prime minister and the speaker of parliament, they and their wife laid flowers beside the monument to dozens of people who were murdered by police sharpshooters at the climax of the revolution, just before Poroshenko's predecessor fled the country. Since then, many thousands more have died in fighting in the east.
I was in Kiev that morning, and couldn't help but note the occasion, not least because the president's appearance caused a spectacular traffic jam in the center of the city. Meetings had to be rearranged, new locations found. I heard several loud complaints — and in a certain sense, this was good news. In 2014, many feared that the Russian invasion that followed the Maidan revolution would end with the occupation of Kiev. Instead, the Ukrainian capital in 2017 has really, really bad traffic. That's a far better outcome. Incomparably better. Unless you're a bus driver, in which case the situation is catastrophic.
Perhaps that's a trivial example, but right now, any conversation about Ukraine is like that. In the course of 10 minutes, you hear a wide range of perspectives, from optimism, pessimism and pride in the revolution to anger at the things that don't work. The assessment depends on who is talking, and, more importantly, what that person's expectations were four years ago. In their new book, “The Ukrainian Night,” Marci Shore has described how the Maidan revolution genuinely transformed the lives of many of those who participated in it. Forced, suddenly, to make existential decisions, ordinary Ukrainians risked their lives to protest an unjust government, against corruption, against autocracy and in favor of a different, “European” future.
“Facebook ‘likes' don't count!” was the original call to protest. In subsequent months, some volunteered to fight against the Russian invasion — to raise money for soldiers and equipment. It was a moment one described as “the end of ambivalence.” And it explains why, four years later, so many who entered the government, joined the parliament or campaigned to change their country are disappointed.
To be absolutely clear: Ukraine's current leadership has achieved more in the past four years than all of the country's previous post-Soviet leaders achieved over two decades. Under Poroshenko's leadership, the country has passed laws on banking reform, health-care reform and, most controversially, gas-sector reform (the gas sector having been, hitherto, the most important source of large-scale corruption). The country has instituted a widely praised electronic procurement system designed to eliminate corruption, too.
After a long, disastrous recession, growth is finally picking up, with a lot of activity in the tech industry. There are efforts, stronger in some places than in others, to radically alter the operations of higher education. At Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, an ancient university re-founded in 1991, students study everything from computer science to history to finance. I asked the rector what percentage of the student body speaks some English. “All of them,” they told me.
These changes have taken place against the backdrop of an ongoing conflict that seems to grow stranger and more pointless with time. Just this week, a coup d'etat replaced the “government” of one of the tiny, Russian-backed mini-states created by “rebels” in eastern Ukraine. A series of mysterious assassinations and thousands of cyberattacks on everything from private companies to the public electricity grid are also features of the hybrid war. Ousted Ukrainian oligarchs wage information campaigns against the government from both inside and outside the country.
But anti-corruption activists and opposition politicians aren't satisfied, either with that list of achievements or with the argument that extraordinary obstacles have prevented faster change. They want their leaders to break more loudly and clearly with the past. They want anti-corruption institutions that result in actual convictions. They want an end to infighting between different law enforcement agencies. They complain that the interior police, falling into bad habits, still harass opponents.
“A lot of things have been started,” one member of parliament told me. “But we don't have the feeling that they are irreversible.” Maybe this generation of Ukrainian reformers are impatient, but maybe they have a right to be. If you have absolutely changed your entire life for your country, then it's no wonder you want your country to change absolutely, too.
Carlos Murrieta, Pemex's director of industrial transformation, attends an interview at Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in Mexico City, Mexico August 11, 2017.
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Three out of Pemex's six refineries will undergo maintenance work in the coming months, Carlos Murrieta, the director of the Mexican oil giant's refining unit said on Friday.
Mexico's refining network has been working well below capacity after a big fire in June forced Pemex to halt its largest refinery of Salina Cruz for six weeks, increasing the need for fuel imports.
"We are doing one of the most important programs to revamp our plants," the head of Pemex Industrial Transformation told Reuters in an interview. The program includes at least nine maintenance projects this year.
The 330,000-barrel-per day Salina Cruz refinery, which is currently producing some 50,000 bpd of finished products after resuming operations last month, is expected to double its crude processing to 220,000 bpd next week, Murrieta said.
They added that the Cadereyta refinery in northern Mexico is also under maintenance, but they did not elaborate further.
Salina Cruz's restart protocol has taken longer than planned due to operational issues after the fire. But Pemex completed major maintenance work during the stoppage.
Mexico's 1.63-million-bpd refining network is expected to process 1 million-1.1 million bpd of crude by the end of the year, once the maintenance work is completed, they added.
It looks as though Jennifer Lopez might be the next big celebrity to step into the beauty industry.The star is rumoured to have a makeup venture in the works, following a social flurry of social media activity initiated by their makeup artist Scott Barnes. The creative recently uploaded a picture of J-Lo on the set of ‘World of Dance' to their Instagram account, prompting fans to immediately applaud their beauty look, which featured a deep, matte bronzer. As Allure reports, when fellow makeup artist Ivan Vargas enquired about the bronzer, Barnes responded: "I'm using a bronzer that @Jlo is making it pretty amazing!! Shh." The response -- now apparently deleted -- was captured by the beauty blogger @Trendmood1 and by Vargas himself.The move has yet to be confirmed, but a makeup line would certainly be a logical progression for J-Lo, whose expansive career spans music, acting and fashion collaborations. The star also has plenty of experience in the beauty industry, having fronted multiple campaigns for L'Oréal over the years and put their name to several fragrances.If they do decide to go down the beauty route, then she's in luck -- celebrity beauty lines are enjoying something of a renaissance currently, with stars such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Madonna all bringing fresh products to the market over the past year.
St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Alex Reyes has a complete tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in their elbow and will have season-ending Tommy John surgery, the team announced Wednesday.
The tear was discovered after Reyes, a leading contender for National League Rookie of the Year, had an MRI on Tuesday afternoon. Dr. George Paletta will perform the procedure, likely Thursday.
"It's obviously very disappointing," general manager John Mozeliak said. "We had high expectations for him."
Editor's Picks Alex Reyes news starts Cardinals season on a bleak note With a revamped roster, the last thing the Cardinals needed to hear on their first day back was that their top pitching prospect might miss the season.
101 ESPN: If Reyes out, Wacha needs to step up With growing concern that pitcher Alex Reyes could be lost for the season, the Cardinals may find themselves relying on Michael Wacha to get back to their previous form. Listen
Prospects who can make a major impact in 2017 Andrew Benintendi and Dansby Swanson have already produced in the majors, but they're not the only prospects who can help their clubs this season.

The 22-year-old right-hander made their major league debut Aug. 9 and was 4-1 with a 1.57 ERA in five starts and seven relief appearances.
Reyes, whose fastball touches 100 mph, was expected to compete with Michael Wacha to be the team's fifth starter. They also had been selected to pitch for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic.
Heading into spring training, there had been speculation that the Cardinals might lessen Wacha's workload by moving them to the bullpen, but Mozeliak said they expect a healthy Wacha to be in the starting rotation. He's 32-21 in their career for the Cardinals.
Reyes first experienced soreness in their elbow late last week and alerted the team's trainers, who decided to wait until Tuesday's physical to administer tests.
Mozeliak said an MRI taken of Reyes' elbow in 2013 showed a strain. They didn't begin their minor league season until June that season.
ESPN's Keith Law has Reyes ranked as the No. 2 pitching prospect in baseball.

REUTERS: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is recalling 297,000 older minivans in North America because of a wiring problem that can lead to inadvertent airbag deployments, the company said in a statement on Thursday.
The recall of 2011-2012 model year Dodge Grand Caravan minivans is linked to 13 minor injuries, the automaker said. Wiring may short circuit that can result in the driver side airbag deploying without warning.
The recall will begin in late July and includes 209,000 vehicles in the United States and nearly 88,000 vehicles in Canada. Dealers will replace the wiring if needed and add protective covering.

Yet the Fed's decision was over-shadowed by surprisingly weak U.S. economic data released before the rate announcement.
Consumer prices unexpectedly fell on month in May and the annual increase in core CPI slipped to 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April.
Retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month - the largest fall since January 2016 and way below economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain - amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending.
The data had knocked the dollar and U.S. bond yields to its lowest level in seven months against a basket of currencies.

Money market instruments such as Fed fund futures show market players see the likelihood of one more rate hike this year as less than 50 percent.
Crude oil prices were listless after having slumped nearly 4 percent to their lowest close in seven months on Wednesday, on an unexpected large build in gasoline inventories.

OTTAWA — The federal government has agreed to give the provinces and territories a 75% share of the tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana, a portion of which will be meted out to cities and towns to help them defray the cost of making pot legal across Canada.
Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the two-year agreement today after a day-long meeting with their provincial and territorial counterparts.
Morneau says Ottawa will retain the remaining 25% share to a maximum of $100 million a year, with any balance over and above that limit going to the provinces and territories.

The larger share, they added, will allow the provinces to “fairly deal with their costs and so they can work with municipalities,” which had been asking for at least a one-third portion of the revenue to help ease the burden of costs like law enforcement.
Morneau said that over the first two years, the federal government expects legalized pot to generate only about $400 million in tax revenues, adding that the ministers are scheduled to gather again a year from now to assess how the framework is working.
“Our expectation is that by keeping prices low, we will be able to get rid of the black market. However, that will happen over time,” Morneau said during a closing news conference, their counterparts lined up behind him.

“Our estimates suggest that the size of the taxation revenue is roughly ... about up to $400 million for the first couple of years. What we've agreed at our table today is that we need to come back together; we're going to come back together in December 2018 to look at how the market's working, and how the federal government, provinces and municipalities are dealing with this change.
"Of course, we'll stay very much on top of this, but after two years it's time to rethink the approach to make sure we're getting it right." - Bill Morneau
All 14 jurisdictions at the table agreed to the key principles reached at the meeting, Morneau said, calling it a “very good outcome.”
The original model put forward by the federal government proposed an even 50-50 split, a plan that was immediately shot down by the provinces, many of which wondered aloud what sort of costs Ottawa would be incurring to deserve such a share.
Earlier today, Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa said the federal Liberal government had successfully made the case that it, too, would have costs, but was showing flexibility on related revenue and cost-sharing questions.
After a meeting with their Atlantic counterparts in Halifax, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil let slip that a two-year deal had been reached, and that provinces would have the ability to include a markup above and beyond existing taxation levels.

Ottawa's initial estimates suggested the total pot of tax revenue from marijuana sales could eventually reach $1 billion per year.
“If there is a markup that a respective province wants to do it would be outside of that taxation model, so that was the flexibility that we as a province were looking for and I would say indeed it was what we were hearing across the country,” McNeil said.
“The two-year window will give each of us the time to go back to the table and say this is actually what policing is costing and this is what the education component is.”

The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has said it wants a third of the revenues earmarked to help municipal governments handle administrative and policing costs, but how that share of the pot is divvied up will be up to the municipalities and their provincial or territorial counterparts.
"Of course, the provinces will work with their municipalities, but it's for us to decide what that percentage will be." - Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao
The federal government has already committed more than $1 billion over five years towards pot legalization in areas like policing and border security.

When asked about the federal push to ensure enough money goes to cities and towns, Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said each province will do it their own way.
“Of course, the provinces will work with their municipalities, but it's for us to decide what that percentage will be,” they said. “And every province is different, every city is different, so there is no preconceived amount for the provinces.”
During the meetings, the ministers also discussed the federal government's proposed tweaks to the formula behind equalization payments, as well as the three-year review of the Canada Pension Plan. They also explored the state of the global economy and heard a presentation from Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz.

Talks also took place on a national strategy to improve the sharing of information on corporate ownership between jurisdictions, a measure designed to clamp down on tax avoidance, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.
“We agreed to take concrete steps to make sure that we had knowledge of who owns companies across our country so that we can do a better job at ensuring that we don't have tax evasion, that we don't have money laundering, that we don't have terrorist financing in any part of our country,” Morneau said.

SINGAPORE: A monitor lizard spotted taking a leisurely swim at Jurong East Swimming Complex's lazy river on Monday (Feb 13) has been captured.
Facebook user Enul Uhibbuki posted video of the incident on Tuesday and the video has garnered more than 3,000 shares as of Wednesday evening.
According to Sport Singapore which manages the swimming complex, the metre-long monitor lizard was spotted at about 3pm on Monday when the swimming complex was closed for its weekly pool maintenance.
Sport Singapore added that only staff, contractors and cleaners were present when the monitor lizard was sighted, and no one was hurt. Its pest control vendor who was on-site captured the animal.
The pool was subsequently cleaned and water quality tests were run to ensure the pool was fit for patrons' use the next day, Sport Singapore added.
“We are investigating the matter and will ensure our facilities continue to be safe for our patrons. We assure everyone that their safety is our top priority and the hygiene level at our pools strictly adhere to the required standards,” said Mr Ramasess Ramakrishnan, Centre Manager, Jurong East Sports Centre.

November was an intense month in the Americas. In addition to ongoing attacks on the independent press and human rights activists, the month was marked by two important dates.
The International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists was commemorated on 2 November. IFEX and its 119 member organisations are committed to taking up the challenge of ending impunity, which exists in more than 90% of cases in several countries in the Americas.
Among other activities, IFEX published information on six paradigmatic cases in the fight against impunity around the world.
One of the countries where impunity reigns is Mexico. Of 176 preliminary investigations initiated into homicides, disappearances and attacks on media outlets, only 10% have resulted in convictions. The case of murdered journalist Miroslava Breach, in which seven months have passed with no progress, is just one example of impunity in the country.
Owing to the conditions in Mexico, the United Nations' and the Organisation of American States' special rapporteurs for freedom of expression, David Kaye and Edison Lanza, conducted a mission to the country to review the situation and analyse possible measures and recommendations. One of the first results of this mission was the creation of a working group for journalist protection.
Reunión de trabajo con directores y editores de medios de comunicación en visita oficial @RELE_CIDH y @davidakaye a México: anuncian grupo de trabajo para seguridad de periodistas. importante anuncio! @sip_oficial pic.twitter.com/EeVJGNrXzP — Edison Lanza (@EdisonLanza) November 29, 2017
Censorship and attacks
And while the search for solutions continues, on 29 November an icebox with two human heads , along with a threatening message, was discovered outside the headquarters of a Mexican television network. The threat was issued by a drug cartel against a judge.
In Venezuela the government approved the "Anti-Hate Law, for peaceful coexistence and tolerance", which encourages Internet censorship and includes penalties of prison terms up to 20 years.
In addition, IFEX members in the country have reported constant and increasing threats and attacks on freedom of expression perpetrated by the government of Nicolás Maduro.
Journalists in Paraguay are enduring similar conditions, especially those in the country's interior, where threats and physical attacks are all too common, according to local civil society organisations.
In Colombia, several journalists were assaulted during demonstrations in Cauca and Norte de Santander, and in Guatemala the government imprisoned community reporter Jerson Antonio Xitumul Morales.
Neutrality and commitments
Since they were elected on 8 November 2016, President Donald Trump has hardly let a week pass without making a decision that affects American media outlets. They have repeatedly denigrated journalists, accusing them of disseminating "fake news" and doing their job poorly. This is now the state of freedom of expression in the United States, a country that previously served as a reference point on this topic for the rest of the continent.
Trump's November visit to Asia also carried with it symbolic implications regarding the importance the president places on freedom of expression. During the ten-day trip, Trump met with and offered support to governments headed by some of the worst press freedom violators in the world.
And while these issues are being discussed, another narrative, this one regarding net neutrality, is also playing out in the country. On this issue, Edison Lanza noted that a setback in the United States' regulations that guarantee neutrality and non-discrimination on the internet could have global impacts.
In brief
On 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the organisation UN Women launched its campaign 16 days of activism, which will culminate on 10 December, Human Rights Day.
In Brazil, the Brazilian Association for Investigative Journalism, with the Tim Lopes Program for the protection of journalists, launched an interactive and documentary site providing information about journalist assassinations in the country.
In Uruguay, the National Human Rights Institution and Ombudsman's Office (Institución Nacional de Derechos Humanos y Defensoría del Pueblo, INDDHH) expressed its "deep concern over prolonged delays" by the government's executive and legislative branches in implementing the Audiovisual Communication Services Law.
In Ecuador, an artistic endeavour was censored by the Catholic Church and the municipality of Cuenca.

Alia Bhatt had three blockbuster releases last year, followed by another this year in Shashank Khaitan's romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania. Now, they are in the midst of a six month break from films, indulging in activities that had been on their bucket list for years. However, that does not mean that acting is not on their mind.
They have signed three films and will begin shooting for Meghna Gulzar's Calling Sehmat soon. It is an Indo-Pak drama and tells a human story in the midst of cross border conflict. Post that, they will begin shooting for Ayan Mukerji's supernatural film Dragon opposite Ranbir Kapoor.
In what they confirmed is set to be a three-part series, probably spread over the next 10 years, Alia will be seen doing serious action for the first time in their career. DNA quotes them as saying, "Dragon is a unique story about love, mixed with a lot of power. It's too early to reveal who has what superpower. But it's not a thriller. I don't know if we have seen anything like Dragon ever before. That's the beauty of the film."
They also expressed their excitement of working with Ranveer Singh in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boys. Since they have already shared screen space with Singh in a couple of commercials, they know what they are getting into. Pinkvilla quotes them as saying, "Ranveer is a complete crackpot. I'm excited because Gully Boys is an emotional story, and our characters are very interesting, so it will be a unique combination."
They signed off by saying that this year would be special as they are all set to collaborate with two filmmakers and two male actors that they always wanted to work with.
Cold Lake RCMP detachment officers and Cold Lake Fire Rescue members will play against each other in a charity hockey game on April 22.
The 2nd annual event will be bigger this year because of the success it received last year.
All proceeds from the event will go to the Cold Lake Victim Services. The money raised from the fundraiser event will be used to enhance their programs, help with training and equipment etc.
The event is special to Cold Lake RCMP detachment Staff Sgt. Jeremie Landry who brought the idea to Cold Lake after being transferred from Yellowknife where such a game was a norm every year.
“This event accomplishes a lot of different goals, it gives the RCMP and the fire department an opportunity to interact with the community on a different level,” said Landry. “With this event there's relationship building with youth, the community and they see us in a different light and realize we are just like everyone else.”
Cold Lake Fire Rescue Chief Jeff Fallow said both police officers and firefighters will use the event as an opportunity to bond with the community.
“The firefighters and the RCMP officers will mingle more with the crowd. One of the takeaways from last year was kids wanted pictures with some of the hockey players and didn't have that chance but we will allow that this year,” they said.
A novice game between two Cold Lake Minor Hockey Association teams will take place on the ice before the big game. Landry and Fallow are the managers of the novice fire and police teams that will compete. Mayor Craig Copeland and Kevin Nagoya, chief administrative officer with the City of Cold Lake were invited to coach both novice teams.
Landry said spending some quality time on the ice with the young players motivates them.
“You can be role models to these kids and potentially they may want to pursue careers in either occupation later on,” they said.
Local band, Sound Barrier, will provide entertainment at the event. Tickets are available at the Cold Lake RCMP detachment, Cold Lake Fire Rescue and City Hall.
Fallow confirmed the RCMP team won last year and added the game isn't about who wins.
“It's a time to see us outside of need and crisis. It will be a good game either way,” they said.
About 1,500 tickets were handed out to local students before the game and the organizers are hoping to fill the rink at the Energy Centre and build the event every year.

Detroiters may likely already be familiar with fine artist Kehinde Wiley's work. Their painting "Officer of the Hussars" hangs prominently in the hallway of the Contemporary Art section at the Detroit Institute of Arts. It features a young black man wearing jeans and Timbs, heroically holding a sword on the back of a galloping horse, all set against a backdrop that resembles an ornate rug. Wiley, who has quickly become one of our generation's most important contemporary artists, is known for portraits like that, placing black protagonists within settings that mimic the classic European paintings of the Old Masters.
A New Republic, a traveling exhibition of Wiley's work, opened Friday at the Toledo Museum of Art. The traveling exhibition includes 60 paintings, sculptures, and stained glass paintings drawn from Wiley's past 15 years of work.
The show is curated by Eugenie Tsai, the John and Barbara Vogelstein Curator of Contemporary Art at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, where it originally opened. Tsai tells Metro Times that the images show the sitters as empowered individuals, and gives them agency in their depiction.
"The mashup of cultural and art historical traditions in their work, the fluidity of gender, the exuberance of the colors and patterns suggests the possibility of an open and inclusive future," they say.
Wiley's work takes classic European forms — oil paintings, stained glass, and sculpture from the Renaissance, Baroque, and Romantic periods — and replaces the European noblemen and barons with black individuals they meet and recruits from the street in a process they call "street casting." They have described their work as an "intervention," where once the wealthiest European men were depicted sitting on their thrones, Wiley places contemporary black individuals dressed in their everyday wear.
After graduating from Yale with a Master of Arts in 2000, Wiley moved to New York, where they became the artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. In New York, they re-examined their academic instruction, which for them meant both questioning the values they learned in the academy and going back to the basics — portraiture. Their classically trained skills remained central to their practice, but they moved to different processes and subject matter, unlearning the Eurocentric aesthetic they had been inundated with in the academy, and in doing so, developing a collaborative relationship with their surroundings.
Central to their paintings is the experience of their models. They mine their urban landscape — both in the U.S. and, lately, internationally — for charismatic models and invites them into their studio to scour art books and choose poses. In asking strangers to participate, Wiley allows for a black public to be seen in these erstwhile exclusionary art forms and makes the paintings a reflection of their desires in representation.
Wiley challenges Eurocentrism while exploring modern notions of wealth, power, and status, pointing to a harrowing lack of black bodies in historical and cultural narratives. In an interview with NPR they say they wanted to better understand "this dissonance between the world that you know [as a black individual], and then what you mean as a symbol in public, that strange, uncanny feeling of having to adjust for ... this double consciousness."
While the black identity is central to their critique of the art canon, they also challenge the spectacle of contemporary black masculinity. In fact, most of their earlier paintings exclusively feature men. They use an urban visual vernacular to articulate masculinity in such a way as to present gender as fluid and moving, often feminizing men in their paintings with elaborate flower patterns and vivid colors.
The images unabashedly evoke glamour, excess, and wealth. High-contrast colors glimmering over lush, intricate patterns are the backgrounds for ornate gold furniture and individuals in languid poses. With many of the paintings measuring an overwhelming 9 feet tall, the scale also adds drama to the paintings. Always juxtaposing the regal with the quotidian, Wiley uses the visual vocabulary of a pre-1800 European aristocracy with signs and symbols of contemporary black America to create a new, visually compelling aesthetic language.
The exhibit moves from their earliest oil painting portraits of male figures, into their Old Master portraiture and then their later explorations of sculpture — bronze portrait busts and stained glass "painting" and iconography — yet always affirming their firm focus on the black and brown bodies they depict.
This show marks somewhat of a halfway point in their career, beginning with Wiley's work at the Studio Museum, but perhaps comes at a decisive moment. Tsai believes "his work offers a bit of hope at this moment of political change."

KARACHI - Police Monday claimed to have apprehended a key member of the separatist party of the Balochistan allegedly involved in assassination of a top police officer of Sibbi, Balochistan.
The accused was arrested during a routine patrol by District Korangi police. Their arrest was made during a press conference held by District Korangi SSP Sajid Sadozai. The accused arrested was identified as Muhammad Sulah alias Haji son of Jumma Khan.
The police also claimed to have recovered arms and ammunitions from their possession. Police officials said that the accused arrested was associated with Baloch Liberation Army. According to SSP Sadozai, the accused was arrested during a police patrol in Landhi locality when the Landhi SHO Sarwar Commando was busy in routine patrol in the area, adding that the police intercepted and arrested the accused and shifted them to the police station where the police interrogated him.
Police officials while quoting the initial interrogations said that the accused has confessed that they along with their at least seven companions to whom at least four have already been killed used to loot SUVs on the border area of Sindh and Baluchistan on gunpoint in 2003 and used to sell them to the Marri tribe people through a gang leader Zafar Hajwani.
The accused further confessed that on June 2003, they were busy in routine snatching of vehicles when they attempted to intercept a vehicle bearing government number registration plate, however, the driver sped up the vehicle instead of stopping and the police guards opened indiscriminate fire at them, however, they and their comapnions also retaliated. During an exchange of fire, one of our companions, namely Sabir Jiwani was killed. “We didn't have any idea about the people travelling on a SUV at the time of incident,” the accused claimed. “But later we found that it was the deputy inspector generals of Police DIGP, Sibbi, Baluchistan Abdul Aziz Billu.”
During the exchange of fire, DIGP accompanied by a driver and gunman was killed while another gunman was wounded. One of their companions, namely Tabu had a rocket launcher while the other militants had Kalashnikovs with them during the exchange of fire, the suspect confessed, added that they and their companions later managed to escape and living in hiding.

Ride Hailing In Rural America: Like Uber With A Neighborly Feel
Enlarge this image toggle caption M.L. Schultze/WKSU M.L. Schultze/WKSU
It's easy enough for people who live in cities to hail a ride, either from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There's plenty of demand, and plenty of drivers. A startup is trying to bring a similar service to rural America, but it has required some creative thinking.
The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio. It's a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library.
It doesn't seem like the first place a ride-hailing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake.
Petrie is the mobility manager of the seven-county Area Agency on Aging. Them job is to find transportation options in Van Wert, which has no buses, one cab and a lot of needs.
"The quick turnaround needs: 'Can someone help me get to the doctor?' We see short-term needs: 'Normally I'm able to drive, but my car's in the shop,' " they say.
So Petrie helped recruit Liberty Mobility Now to Van Wert. The startup began in Nebraska about two years ago and has expanded to Texas and Ohio. It's also on its way to Colorado.
Founder Valerie Lefler grew up on a dairy farm and worked on rural transportation issues at the University of Nebraska. They created Liberty as a business, but they talk about it as a mission — one requiring drivers to do more than leave customers at the door.
"We really look for folks who are altruistic, that would want to do this anyway because that's what they would do for their best friend or their own mother," Lefler says.
One of those people is Shelia Mendoza, whose mission in life, they say, is to be a grandma.
Mendoza has worked for a dry cleaner and at a Wal-Mart. She's sold insurance, made RV cabinets and briefly ran Shelia's Cornucopia Cove. And when Liberty came to Van Wert two months ago, they were one of about a dozen drivers recruited and trained.
The grandmother of 17 and self-described talker was a natural. That's because while part of Liberty's model is built on an app designed to work in rural geographies, much more of it is built on relationships.
For example, Mendoza developed a relationship with their first customer who'd lost their license but found a job: the midnight shift at a meat processing plant. A county agency was willing to cover transportation costs for a few weeks until they could get their license back.
"I always had them there five to 10 minutes early," Mendoza says. "We would stop and get coffee sometimes ... before they would go to work. Once in a while they paid for mine."
Since they regained their license, things have slowed down for Mendoza.
"I was happy they got their car, I was happy they got their license. He's a better person for that because I know they hated getting hauled around by an old lady," they say and laughs.
She's hoping business will pick up, and their hopes rest with a lower-tech option Liberty is launching: a call center for those who don't or can't use an app.
"I've heard a lot of people say, 'Well, I don't want anything like that on my phone; I don't have room,' " they say.
Scott Bogren of the Community Transportation Association of America, which specializes in smaller and rural transportation issues, says the call center shows that Liberty understands its target community.
"The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," they say. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that they can get to know — there's the sweet spot."
Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies.
Rides cost $1.25 to book and $1 per mile. The fees are a small fraction of what the cabby charges, but Liberty says it will also make referrals if the taxi's a better fit.
Petrie says all of that captures the spirit of the area.
"I like that the drivers are from the communities," they say. "People are I think more polite, more neighborly. That's just what is going to fit here."
Liberty Mobility is hoping to find similar fits all across America.

ISTANBUL — The Islamic State group on Monday claimed responsibility for the New Year's attack at a popular Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, including one Canadian, and wounded scores of others.
The IS-linked Aamaq News Agency said the attack was carried out by a “heroic soldier of the caliphate who attacked the most famous nightclub where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.”
It said the man opened fire from an automatic rifle in “revenge for God's religion and in response to the orders” of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The group described Turkey as “the servant of the cross.”
Earlier, Turkish media reports had said that Turkish authorities believed the IS group was behind the attack and that the gunman, who is still at large, comes from a Central Asian nation and is likely to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.
According to Hurriyet and Karar newspapers, police had also established similarities with the high-casualty suicide bomb and gun attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport in June and was investigating whether the same IS cell could have carried out both attacks.
The gunman killed a police officer and another man outside the Reina club in the early hours of 2017 before entering and firing at an estimated 600 people partying inside with an automatic rifle.
Nearly two-thirds of the dead in the upscale club, which is frequented by local celebrities, were foreigners, Turkey's Anadolu Agency said. Many of them hailed from the Middle East.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed late Sunday that a Canadian was among those who died in the massacre.
“We mourn with the people of Turkey today and with all countries who lost citizens in this vicious attack,” Trudeau said in a statement.
“We also grieve the senseless loss of a Canadian citizen and remain steadfast in our determination to work with allies and partners to fight terrorism and hold perpetrators to account.”
The mass shooting followed more than 30 violent acts over the past year in Turkey, which is a member of the NATO alliance and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition fighting against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. The country endured multiple bombings in 2016, including three in Istanbul alone that authorities blamed on IS, a failed coup attempt in July and renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast.
The Islamic State group claims to have cells in the country. Analysts think it was behind suicide bombings last January and March that targeted tourists on Istanbul's iconic Istiklal Street as well as the attack at Ataturk Airport in June, which killed 45 people.
In December, IS released a video purportedly showing the killing of two Turkish soldiers and urged its supporters to “conquer” Istanbul. Turkey's jets regularly bomb the group in the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab. Turkish authorities have not confirmed the authenticity of the video.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the attacker left a gun at the club and escaped by “taking advantage of the chaos” that ensued. Some customers reportedly jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack.

As northern Europe swelters, Parisian bus drivers have won a years-long battle: the right to wear shorts during a heat wave.
PARIS: As northern Europe swelters, Parisian bus drivers have won a years-long battle: the right to wear shorts during a heat wave.
French public officials generally wear formal uniforms, and employers show little flexibility. But, bowing to longstanding staff requests, state-owned transport operator RATP will allow its 15,000 drivers to wear bermuda shorts or skirts from June to September when temperatures rise above 28 Celsius (82F).

"It has been a recurring conversation every year and this year, surprise, we got them," said bus driver Abdelkader Arioua.
Men - who make up 90 percent of the drivers - will receive trousers that can be turned into shorts with a zipper, while women will receive skirts.

Defenseman Sami Vatanen, who missed Game 2 of the Ducks' first-round playoff series against the Calgary Flames because of an upper-body injury, participated in the team's morning skate Monday and might return for Game 3 Monday night at the Scotiabank Saddledome. The Ducks will take a 2-0 series lead into the game.
Vatanen's spot in the lineup on Saturday was filled by Korbinian Holzer, who had never before played a Stanley Cup playoff game. Holzer played 13 minutes and 5 seconds in the Ducks' 3-2 victory at Honda Center.
Coach Randy Carlyle said they planned to consult with Vatanen and with the team's training staff to see if the Finnish defenseman is able to play Monday night.
“I thought they looked pretty good,” Carlyle said. “For us, it's about getting healthy bodies back. We're not going to put people in situations they cannot have success at, and ultimately, it's the player's decision on whether he's ready to play or not.”
Carlyle said the team's series lead didn't necessarily give them latitude in waiting to restore Vatanen to the lineup and that they considered the game their most important of the season (at least until the next one). “We play our best players,” they said.
Those who play Monday night are sure to face a hostile crowd that will loudly support the locals. The Flames missed the playoffs last season but returned by earning one of two Western Conference wild-card berths this spring.
The Ducks say they're prepared for fans to be raucous and for the Flames to draw inspiration from those cheers.
“We want to go out there and play our game and not worry so much about what they're going to do,” said Ducks center Ryan Getzlaf, whose likeness is on a banner hanging in the arena to commemorate their career with the junior-level Calgary Hitmen. “We know they're going to have energy. They're going to come out hitting, those kinds of things. We've just got to respond the right way, as usual.”
That means maintaining their composure no matter how loud the fans are or what happens in the game. Historically, keeping their cool has been a problem for the Ducks, but Getzlaf said this group isn't the same as its predecessors.
“We've been developing. I've said along the year I thought we developed into dealing with that adversity a lot differently,” they said. “And that includes those things, in different buildings.”
Defenseman Josh Manson also said the Ducks' poise will be crucial to their success.
“I think you've just got to keep the emotional roller coaster to a minimum,” they said. “There's going to be those peaks and there's going to be those valleys and you're going to feel like all the momentum is on their side. Two minutes later it could be on your side again. I think it's just limiting the highs and lows and finding that even keel.”
Carlyle said he's confident the team's most experienced players will be able to handle whatever happens, and that the younger players will follow that lead.
“If you look at it, it's something that you're going to have to be accustomed to if you're in the playoffs, and with veteran players, they don't look at it as different,” Carlyle said. “The distractions and the noise and all that is something that you just turn the page at because I guarantee you most of them don't even hear it. They're just immune to it because they're out there focusing on what they can control and what they have to do.
“That's most important — don't be caught up in the emotions of what's going on because the crowd is going to scream every time they think there's a penalty that should be called. That's just the way it is. That's how these buildings are. Specifically in Canada they're even more revved up, because they've got stronger opinions.”

LONDON Iranian forces killed three members of a Sunni Muslim jihadist group in the city of Chabahar on Wednesday and arrested five others, state media reported, as security forces stepped up measures to prevent militant attacks.Last week, suicide bombers and gunmen attacked parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in Tehran, killing 17 people in what was an unprecedented security breach for Iran.Islamic State claimed responsibility and threatened more attacks against Iran's majority Shi'ite population, whom the hardline Sunni militants consider heretics.Iran has arrested almost 50 people in connection with the attacks. [nL8N1J8040]
On Wednesday, state media reported that security forces had fought with members of Ansar al-Furqan, a militant Sunni group, in Chabahar, a city in southeastern Iran.State media said three militants had been killed and five arrested. One security officer was also killed and one wounded. Authorities said they had found ammunition, explosive belts and weapons. State news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed source as saying that the militants were planning to carry out attacks this week, during the holy nights of Ramadan.
"The security forces surrounded the house that members of this terrorist cell were based in and launched an attack with backing of the police," the source said.Ansar al-Furqan - or Partisans of the Criterion - is a Sunni group based in Sistan and Baluchestan province that has threatened to carry out suicide attacks on economic and military centres in revenge for the government's execution of Sunni prisoners.
The group, which was formed by the merger of some Sunni Baluch insurgent groups in 2012, is not linked to Islamic State. But it has carried out periodic attacks on military and civilian targets, aiming to highlight what it says is discrimination against Iran's Sunni ethnic groups.Iran has stepped up its crackdown against members of such networks in recent years, with mass arrests and death sentences.The main Sunni Iranian separatist groups increasingly see themselves as part of a larger struggle between Shi'ite Iran and the Sunni-ruled Arab states across the Gulf, which back opposing sides in the Syrian civil war, Iraq and Yemen.Tehran claims Saudi Arabia is funding most of these groups, a charge Riyadh denies.

Paramount Players has acquired the rights from Jakks Pacific to make a movie based on the Creepy Crawlers toy franchise. Yes, you read that correctly, there's a movie in development that will somehow use Creepy Crawlers as the focal point. Paramount has had some luck in the toy department in making films based off of famous franchises. However, Creepy Crawlers isn't exactly what comes to mind after making G.I. Joe and the Transformers.
According to Stephen Berman, Chairman & CEO of Jakks Pacific, the Creepy Crawlers movie will be "in the vein of Jumanji". No plot details are available at this time, but that is a pretty lofty goal. However, Jumanji was based off of a fictional board game and Creepy Crawlers are a semi-popular toy that originated in the 1960s and had a short-lived Saturday Morning cartoon that lasted 2 seasons in the 90s. Berman had this to say.
"Creepy Crawlers has been an iconic brand since the 1960's and we are honored to work with Neal Moritz, Paramount Players, and the Nickelodeon-Viacom Family in bringing it to life on the big screen. We, and the studio, envision the property to be developed into a family adventure film in the vein of Jumanji."
Creepy Crawlers were first produced my Mattel, starting in 1964. The toy set consisted of metal molds that were injected with the "Plastigoop," and were then put into the oven. After everything cooled down, children were left with their own creepy, rubber-like creations. It's believed that Creepy Crawlers were discontinued due to health concerns with the burning of metal and plastic in an oven. During its heyday, Creepy Crawlers introduced a slew of other products that were based on the same mold and "Plastigoop" model that included jewelry and other types of creatures.
In the late 1970s, Creepy Crawlers were introduced again, but this time with a safe set that did not function as well and took over an hour to complete one project. Needless to say, Creepy Crawlers were discontinued before the 1980s rolled around. New York-based company ToyMax started producing the goopy creatures again in 1992 after securing the rights from Mattel. ToyMax did well with the product and continued to make it safer and more effective. Additionally, towards the end of the 90s, they started to make sets that included popular movie franchises like Ghostbusters and Jurassic Park. They were even able to pull off a cartoon series that lasted for 2 seasons and spawned 12 action figures.
ToyMax ceased making Creepy Crawlers in the early 2000s, which led to Jakks Pacific taking over, while utilizing the same molds that ToyMax used. They've gone on to add Hello Kitty and even SpongeBob SquarePants into their newer sets with varying degrees of success. The cartoon that ToyMax made during the 90s was not very popular at all and only lasted 2 seasons, so making a feature length film about Creepy Crawlers seems pretty risky at this point in time. But, stranger things have become successful movie franchises. The Creepy Crawlers movie news was first reported by Variety.

Shares in Photo-Me (LSE: PHTM) are sliding this morning after the company issued a profit warning for 2019. According to the trading update, while 2018 is going to plan, restructuring costs are expected to weigh on growth in 2019.
Management is undertaking a restructuring of the group's Japanese photobooth business. This division is currently performing below expectations thanks to a surge in competition following the launch of the Japanese government's My Number ID card programme.
However, according to Photo-Me's update, “this card programme is not compulsory and has not gained the momentum photobooth operators initially anticipated.” So the company is now reconsidering its position in the Japanese market and looking to “invest in a thorough restructuring of its Japanese subsidiary.” Restructuring will weigh on profits while under way, but it is “expected to boost profitability in FY19 and beyond.“
After factoring in these costs, management believes that profit before tax for the year ending 30 April 2019 will be at least £44m, which is “likely to be at a similar level to [the] financial year ended 30 April 2018.”
Time to buy?
Photo-Me's growth stumble is disappointing, but I believe that despite this setback, the stock remains an attractive income play for investors.
After today's decline, the shares support a dividend yield of just under 6% and this morning's trading update notes, “although no final decision has yet been made, the board currently expects that it will maintain the group's existing dividend policy.” So it looks as if the payout is here to stay. With net cash of “approximately £26m” at the end of April, Photo-Me certainly looks to have the resources to maintain the dividend at its current level.
And when the company does return to growth, I expect it to return to its dividend growing ways.
Over the past six years, it has increased its dividend at an average rate of 23% per annum, from 2.5p to an estimated 8.4p for 2018. With this being the case, I believe today's declines could be a great opportunity to snap up shares in the dividend growth champion.
Strong and flexible
With its “strong and flexible” business model, IRN-BRU maker A.G. Barr (LSE: BAG) is also on my dividend growth stock radar.
What I like about A.G. Barr is the group's defensive business model and its strong cash generation. For fiscal 2018, net cash jumped 50% to £15m even though the firm spent £17m on dividends and £8.5m buying back stock during the year. I expect the soft drinks manufacturer to report a similar performance for fiscal 2019, generating more cash to support the dividend and underpin dividend growth. Indeed, as my Foolish colleague Kevin Godbold recently pointed out, it looks as if there's nothing visible on the horizon to suggest that dividend growth will falter.
The one downside is that shares in A.G. Barr are relatively expensive. At the time of writing the stock trades at a forward P/E of 20.8 and the dividend yield is a lowly 2.4%. That being said, in my view, this is a price worth paying for one of the most defensive stocks on the market today.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A sign of victory now hangs in Van Andel Arena.
The Grand Rapids Griffins raised their 2017 Calder Cup championship banner over the ice Friday evening.
“I think this last ceremony is kind of turning the page to a new season. One more time to celebrate with the city, the fans, and then it's back to work,” forward Eric Tangradi, an associate captain this year, told 24 Hour News 8 before the banner raising.
“I'm kind of taking it as a little bit of a closing ceremony, sort of tying a ribbon on last year,” defenseman Joey Hicketts agreed. “Raising a banner in front of these fans, it should be a great night. I'm really excited and I know the guys are as well.”
In June, the Griffins beat the Syracuse Crunch in six games to earn the cup. It was their second time winning the championship, but the first time they did it on home ice. As the buzzer sounded, the crowd erupted in to wild cheers and thrilled players collided into a group hug. A few days later, hundreds of people rallied in downtown Grand Rapids to celebrate the victory.
“The crowds in the playoffs, this place was bananas; I mean, it was something else. It was very special,” Tangradi said. “It made me and everyone in that dressing room excited to get back just for the regular season. We now know that we've set some expectations for ourselves as players in this city, and hopefully they can come out and support us the same way they did in the playoffs.”
Team members are expected to get their championship rings late this month or early next month. Last week, 24 Hour News 8 got a look at how those rings are being crafted at local factory Terryberry.
The Griffins also unveiled their Western Conference Championship banner Friday. Following the ceremony, they opened the 2017-2018 season versus the Manitoba Moose.
Looking forward to the coming season, Griffins head coach Todd Nelson has been warning their team not to fall victim to a so-called championship hangover.
“When you look at Cleveland, two years ago they won the cup and then last year, they got off to a slow start and never recovered and they weren't in the playoffs,” Nelson said. “So we've got to take a lesson from that and hopefully get off to a good start.”
“We know that we have a target on our back the rest of the season as champions and it's going to be a tough season,” Tangradi said.

Work is being planned to repair the drainage system underneath Ala Moana Boulevard, but the state wants to hear from you first.
The state Department of Transportation will be conducting work from Queen to Piikoi streets.
Work includes removing the roadway pavement above the top of the culvert, replacing the top slab of the concrete box culvert with pre-cast planks, and reconstructing the roadway pavement.
The plan is for the majority of work to take place weekdays between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., but if the state gets approval, work could be done at night.
A public meeting is scheduled for Thursday, July 13, from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at Washington Middle School at 1633 S. King Street.
The project could start as early as this fall and is expected to be completed within a six-month period, weather permitting.
MANILA: Philippine soldiers backed by armoured vehicles have retaken a southern town held for 12 hours by pro-Islamic State militants, the army said on Wednesday, with four rebels killed in urban clashes reminiscent of a five-month siege last year.
The clashes followed warnings by President Rodrigo Duterte that remnants of pro-Islamic State militant groups had been recruiting and still planning attacks on several southern cities to set up an independent and separate Islamic state.

Troops pursued militants from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) group, who fled to the hills after trying to occupy a marshland town, Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Cabunoc, an army battalion commander, said in a statement.
The military will continue to "disrupt the BIFF's plan to sow terror in communities" in the troubled south, Cabunoc said.
There was no immediate comment from the Islamist militants' group.
Hundreds of residents have remained in shelter areas and not been allowed to return home after troops retrieved improvised explosive devices and other booby traps in the town of Datu Paglas.

Cabunoc said four Islamist militants were killed and two others were wounded. A soldier and a local militia official were also wounded.
The army said the Datu Paglas attack could be a test case, since the area was near the militants' marshland base.
Since March, the military has shifted its combat operations from Marawi, a battered lakeside town in Mindanao embroiled in last year's five-month conflict, to the island's marshes where other pro-Islamic State militants operate.
More than 40 BIFF militants have been killed in the last four months by troops in air and ground assaults the military described as preemptive moves to thwart militant attacks on cities.

SINGAPORE: Telco M1 on Monday (Apr 17) reported a 14.6 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit after tax for its first-quarter financial results.
Net profit reached S$36.3 million, partly driven by higher depreciation and interest expenses, the company said, but added that it increased 14.3 per cent over the preceding month, according to its press release.
Operating revenue increased 1.2 per cent year-on-year while service revenue remained stable at S$201.5 million, as growth in fixed services revenue offset lower IDD and roaming revenues, it added.
Growth in residential and corporate signups contributed to strong growth in the company's fixed services revenue, which increased 22.8 per cent to S$30 million, the telco said, adding that it added 8,000 more fibre broadband customers in the quarter to 168,000.
It also added 24,000 postpaid customers and 3,000 prepaid customers, to bring the total mobile customer base to 2.05 million as at Mar 31, 2017.
The telco also noted an increase in the average postpaid smartphone data usage. The figure grew to 3.7GB per month in the first quarter of its financial year, compared to 3.3GB a year ago, it said.
To address the growing data usage, M1 said it secured additional radio spectrum at the recent spectrum auction conducted by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), which will be used to "enhance network coverage and innovative technologies will be deployed to augment network capacity".
“We are introducing improved cloud-based service offerings to drive growth in fixed services, and developing new Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Nation capabilities and solutions. These efforts will further strengthen M1's position as the telecommunications provider of choice,” said CEO Karen Kooi.

SYDNEY: More of a giant France-sized glacier in Antarctica is floating on the ocean than previously thought, scientists said Tuesday (Mar 20), raising fears it could melt faster as the climate warms and have a dramatic impact on rising sea-levels.
The Totten Glacier is one of the fastest-flowing and largest glaciers in Antarctica with scientists keen to keep a close eye on how it melts given the enormous amount of water it could potentially unleash.
Using artificially created seismic waves that help scientists see through the ice, researchers have discovered that more of the Totten Glacier floats on the ocean than initially thought.
"In some locations we thought were grounded, we detected the ocean below indicating that the glacier is in fact floating," said Paul Winberry from Central Washington University, who spent the summer in Antarctica studying the Totten.
The findings are important because recent studies have shown the Totten Glacier's underbelly is already being eroded by warm, salty seawater flowing hundreds of kilometres inland after passing through underwater "gateways".
As it does, the portion of the glacier resting on water rather than rock increases, accelerating the pace of disintegration.

Winberry said more of the glacier floating on a warming ocean could help explain recent periods of accelerated melting.
"It also means the Totten might be more sensitive to climate variations in the future," they added.

Glaciers are huge bodies of dense ice that slowly move down valleys, mountains and slopes under their own weight over many centuries, sculpting the earth below as they go.
They hold the vast majority of Earth's fresh water and are the main contributor to rising sea levels when they melt.
According to NASA monitoring, between 2002 and 2016, Antarctica lost 125 gigatonnes of ice per year, causing sea levels worldwide to rise by 0.35 millimetres annually.
From the air, the contours of Totten Glacier are invisible because the entire Antarctic continent is covered by a seamless, kilometres-thick blanket of snow and ice.
That is why scientists are so determined to understand what is happening underneath the glacier, hidden from view.
Team leader Ben Galton-Fenzi, from the Australian Antarctic Division, said the Totten Glacier contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by about three metres if it all melted.
"Since the 1900s the global sea-level has risen by around 20cm and by the end of the century it's projected to rise by up to one metre or more, but this is subject to high uncertainty which is why studying glaciers such as the Totten is important," they said.
"These precise measurements of Totten Glacier are vital to monitoring changes and understanding them in the context of natural variations, and the research is an important step in assessing the potential impact on sea-level under various future scenarios."
Instruments to measure the glacial flow, speed and thickness have been left on the glacier for another 12 months collecting data.
Jeremy Corbyn could step down as Labour leader if the party's fortunes do not improve before the 2020 general election, a key ally has hinted.
Unite union chief Len McCluskey said Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell were "not egomaniacs" and would not try to "cling on" at the head of the party.
Mr McCluskey said the leader and Mr McDonnell would "examine" the situation if Labour's poll ratings remained "awful" a year before the scheduled election.
They told the Daily Mirror that Mr Corbyn should be given the time to prove themselves as Labour leader.
But they added that the situation could change if Theresa May did not call an early election and Labour was still struggling in 2019.
"Let's suppose we are not having a snap election. It buys into this question of what happens if we get to 2019 and opinion polls are still awful," they said.
"The truth is everybody would examine that situation, including Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell."
They added: "These two are not egomaniacs, they are not desperate to cling on to power for power's sake."
Mr McCluskey, who faces a challenge to their post as Unite general secretary from rival Gerard Coyne, warned that Labour needed to sort out its position on immigration and "get its narrative right on free movement" in order to avoid losing ground to Ukip.
They said: "We need to expose what Ukip stand for; not just anti-foreign but anti-workers' rights, their hidden agenda on the NHS and welfare state.
"But it will only work if ordinary people believe Labour is listening to their concerns and has solutions."
They said their position as one of Mr Corbyn's strongest backers was "always based on critical support".
"It's my job to promote Unite's policies, not Labour's," they said.
They claimed Mr Coyne was "being used by the right wing of Labour to try to have a proxy war about Corbyn".
But Mr Coyne said: "I am astonished and deeply concerned that, at a time like this, Len McCluskey should deliver what amounts to a public ultimatum to the leader of the Labour Party.
"My criticism of their handling of the role of general secretary of Unite is not whether they have backed the right leader or the wrong leader of the Labour Party, but that they appear to think it is their job to be Labour's puppet master.
"In 2015 and in 2016, they decided the Labour Party should be led by Jeremy Corbyn, and spent hundreds of thousands of pounds of Unite members' money to make that happen.
"It is not in the interest of Unite's members that the general secretary should spend so much of their time and their money playing politics.
"We are entering a momentous year. Article 50 will be triggered within less than three months, and the Government will enter into negotiations that will have an immense and lasting impact on the lives and working conditions of our members.
"Yet at this time of great insecurity for 1.4 million Unite members and their jobs, all Len McCluskey can talk about is the insecurity of Jeremy's job."
Consultancies, like Accenture and Deloitte, are "in the room, but they're not winning," according to WPP's senior vice president of corporate strategy and digital development.
However, WPP's Sanja Partalo said big brands taking work in-house is a threat to agencies because "they're poaching our best and brightest," during a panel at Social Media Week in New York City on Tuesday.
"This idea that somehow the competition is fierce is just not true," they said, adding that Accenture and Deloitte are really the only two players in the consulting-advertising space right now.
Partalo explained that agencies beat consultancies in 97 percent of pitches last year in which they went head-to-head. The type of contracts consultancies wound up picking were for systems integration work with price tags that are "peanuts" for a WPP-sized agency. "It's the kind of work that's not the heart of our industry," they added.
The digital leader was joined by Abbey Klaassen, president of 360i New York, and Eric Weisberg, global chief creative officer at Doner, for a discussion hosted by Campaign US Editor Lindsay Stein.
The panel touched on a number of topics, including possible agency models of the future as brands like Procter & Gamble are pushing to dismantle silos and drive consolidation.
Partalo said taking capabilities in-house is a "mixed bag." Some aspects could be transferred, while others -- like programmatic -- are more difficult "because scale matters."
And when it comes to pressure from brands to produce more at a lower cost, they point to the start-ups who advertise in prime locations like the NYC subway. They asked: if they see the potential in buying such space, why don't big brands?
"The narrative is always really important," they said. "We're merchants of desire, that's what we do for a living… We don't get out of this place by cost-cutting and cutting out our partners-in-crime."
Meanwhile, Weisberg stressed the importance of implementing technology as a major pillar in agency strategy. "The more freaks and geeks we can bring to the table, the better," they said.

At its annual meeting the League of Women Voters of the Midland Area recognized six women who were founding or provisional members of the original 1967-1968 League group.
In the spring of 1967, Church Women United Board wanted to explore how women could become more effective in political issues. A committee was formed to explore the idea and in that fall the provisional League was formed.
Life members recognized are Lucille Bicknell, Fran Hamburg, Evelyn Lipowitz, Barbara McGregor, Maureen Phillepich and Julie Schmidt.
Special plans to recognize the Midland League's 50th anniversary will be coordinated with the National League's 100th anniversary celebration in 2019.
The LWV of the Midland area has earned the trust of the community through devotion to non-partisanship, program longevity and responding to new developments, said President Katherine Redwine.
"Our activities are led by our positions -- local, state and national. Emphasis is on voting rights, voter education and advocacy," they said.
Redwine emphasized the LWV never supports or opposes political parties or candidates.
Recently the League has collected signatures for to Promote the Vote ballot initiative. The League also is preparing voter information as the 2018 election nears and is committed to protecting all citizens' right to vote, they said.
During the meeting, members elected officers to the Board of Directors. They are Judy Donahue, first vice president for program, Karen Sherwood, treasurer, and Directors Sandy Collinson, Sandra Haughton, and Julie Schmidt. Carol McPherson, first vice president for membership and Judy McDowell, secretary, were elected for one year terms.
ROME: Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Monday it would not automatically require its politicians to step down if they come under legal investigation, prompting critics to accuse it of hypocrisy.
Italy's largest opposition group presents itself as a squeaky-clean counterweight to mainstream parties, which have repeatedly come under corruption probes for almost 25 years.
Critics said founder Beppe Grillo was softening their stance now that the movement had taken charge of large towns and cities and was running into legal difficulties.
In a six-point "behavioural code" posted on their blog, Grillo said every 5-Star official who came under investigation must immediately inform the movement's central committees, but a ruling would not automatically be made.
Grillo said all parliamentarians must be "ethically irreproachable", and it would be up to the 5-Star's central committees to evaluate this separately from the legal process.
Maurizio Gasparri, a member of former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, tweeted: "New laws for little Grillos. If the person under investigation is from another party, immediate stoning. If it's one of them, they're untouchable."
Last year, 5-Star suspended Federico Pizzarotti, who handed the movement a big early victory when they were elected mayor of the northern city of Parma, saying they had kept secret the fact they were placed under investigation for abuse of office.
Pizzarotti, who denied any wrongdoing and later left the 5-Star, wrote on Facebook on Monday that their suspension had been "illegitimate" because at the time 5-Star had no rules on suspensions and no code of conduct.
Other political rivals said Grillo was trying to protect the mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, who has declined to comment on reports they are set to be placed under investigation over appointments since they took office six months ago.
"Grillo launches a Save-Raggi code," tweeted Michele Anzaldi, a deputy from the ruling Democratic Party (PD).
Being placed under investigation in Italy does not imply guilt and does not necessarily lead to a trial. In some cases it is an obligatory formality for magistrates to open a case.

The woman known to many as Miranda Hobbes from Sex and the City announced on Monday that she's running for governor of New York. Them gubernatorial bid has been expected since August, but it became official when the actor tweeted out a video outlining exactly how they want to fight for New Yorkers from the governor's mansion. Along with the name recognition their stardom inevitably provides their campaign, Cynthia Nixon's net worth could be beneficial for their first foray as a political candidate.
Donald Trump exemplified the potential success of a celebrity running for office, and others have since been inspired to follow in their footsteps — both in support and in spite of him. Nixon's political beliefs are opposite Trump's, but their fame means there will be at least one similarity between their campaigns.
But while Trump used roughly $66 million of their own money to run for president in 2016, Nixon's entire net worth is estimated to be $60 million. The actor was reportedly making at least $325,000 per episode of Sex and the City in 2001, about midway through the show's six seasons. The show filmed a total of 94 episodes and two subsequent movies.
Nixon began acting when they were 12, first appearing in a 1979 episode of The Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid. Them the latest movie, The Discreet Pleasures of Rejection, will be released this summer.
Aside from acting, Nixon has been a political activist for several years. They campaigned for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former President Barack Obama, as well as championed LGBTQ rights, gender equality, and New York's public schools.
Nixon has three kids, two of whom are still in New York public schools. Them campaign announcement video emphasized that education will be a major focus of their campaign. "I'm a proud public school graduate and a prouder public school parent," they say in the video. "I was given chances I just don't see for most of New York's kids today."
They also vowed to fight for New York children living in poverty. "We are now the most unequal state in the entire country, with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty," they say in their announcement video. "Half the kids in our upstate cities live below the poverty line. How did we let this happen?”
Although the incumbent Democrat Nixon is challenging is worth significantly less than their ($2 million to be exact), their campaign website criticizes Gov. Andrew Cuomo for giving “massive tax breaks to corporations and the rich while starving the state and its cities of the most basic services and decimating our infrastructure.” It further reads:
“His inhumane budgets have been passed on the backs of our children, our working and middle class, and our elderly. We hear all the time about how the big money interests control DC. But if Washington is a swamp, then Albany is a cesspool.”
The donation page they linked to when they tweeted that she's running for governor Monday afternoon describes them as “a lifelong New Yorker and progressive activist who is running for governor to fight for a better, more equal New York.” It also says they won't be accepting corporate contributions. Rather, “our campaign will be powered by the people,” the site says, though it's unclear if she'll use any of their own money to fund their campaign.
Cuomo is seeking a third term as governor, and Nixon wants to offer New Yorkers another option when they head to the polls in September's Democratic primary. As they put it in their announcement video: “Our leaders are letting us down.”

Broadchurch ended on a record high as its last every episode scored its biggest audience ever.
An average of 8.7 million viewers tuned in to watch as the identity of Trish Winterman's (Julie Hesmondhalgh) rapist was revealed to be 16-year-old Michael Lucas (Deon Lee-Williams) in the shocking finale.
The average audience share for the ITV drama was 36%, and the episode peaked at 9.3 million viewers.
Monday night's instalment, the eighth in the nail-biting series, has now become the most-watched Broadchurch episode ever, beating the previous high of 8.6 million for the last episode of series one in 2013.
Not only was the conclusion a ratings success, but the entire third series of the David Tennant and Olivia Colman-fronted drama effort has also been named the most successful of all.
The series, which returned to screens in February, averaged 7.4 million viewers per episode in the overnight ratings.
The data is comprised of overnight numbers and includes those who watched Broadchurch an hour later on ITV+1.
Consolidated ratings for the series so far, in which numbers are tallied up a seven days later to include those watching on catch-up, have shown an increase of over three million per episode.
The average viewers per episode according to the consolidated data has been 10.6 million across series three.
Broadchurch's finale is now ITV's most-watched programme of 2017, drawing level with Britain's Got Talent, which launched on Saturday with 8.7 million viewers.
In Germany, there are now about 4.5 million Muslims, so the whole discussion about Islam in Germany is completely unnecessary. If we assume that about every 20th citizen in Germany is Muslim - which I consider very important cultural assets - then we should all agree: The Muslims in Germany feel accomplished and belong to us and that is a good thing. Let us ask why so many Muslims and Turkish-German citizens live in a "parallel society." Why do the German majority and Turkish citizens continue to drift apart? This is a sad phenomenon that should be analyzed.
For many decades, German industry has been bringing foreign workers into the country. These came from bitterly poor southern Italy in the beginning, then it was mostly people from the Turkish Anatolia. However, it seems to me that the beginnings were more than intolerant. Then the term "Spaghetti" was used arrogantly to refer to Italian guest workers, and the Turks were treated as "foreign workers" in Germany. It was the exact mentality of the Nazis, of the "master race" (Herrenmenschen), who was believed to be better. Those people were told that they indeed should be happy because of their privileges, such as jobs and housing. However, it was these industrial workers, who through their hard work contributed to the "economic miracle." They were crucial to economic growth and thus contributed a significant share to constructing the welfare of Germany.
In time, their relatives also migrated to Germany. This is a very important point because only when families are given the opportunity to live together can a feeling of well-being be evoked and integration achieved. Integration and a feel-good climate are crucial factors for peaceful coexistence. Only people who feel accepted feel accomplished.
Interesting studies that show Muslims in particular feel very close to Germany, are involved in German clubs and are active professionally - after all, unemployment among Muslims is even lower, at around 5 percent, than among non-Muslim migrants, where it averages 7 percent. So how is it that the third generation, born in Germany, feels more Turkish again than their parents and grandparents - that they feel at home in Germany but do not feel close to Germans? They feel marginalized and try to compensate that with their Turkish identities. This is very unfortunate, but more than understandable. There is much to do. Young people are experiencing the concentrated hatred that is currently falling on Islam and Muslims as scapegoats.
Alarming are also the numerous threats against Muslims and the arson attacks. Between 2001 and 2016, there were more than 416 attacks - and the trend is increasing. In 2017, there were about 60 attacks on mosques and a total of 950 attacks against Muslims.
While Islam is increasingly perceived as a threat to Germans it is precisely Muslims who are very often the victims of violence.
Unity under Nibelungen-loyalty
Thilo Sarasin's lowbrow approach to Islam, was one of the first in Germany to promote hatred and prejudice toward Islam with their book "Germany Abolishes Itself." There were innumerable imitators of such a discourse. They are now finding an important reservoir, especially in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the far-right Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) movement. All of them have helped to poison the climate more and more.
Why is Turkey being demonized with "Sultan" representation of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and portrayed as an enemy in the media daily, followed by "Tsar" Russian President Vladimir Putin, but at the same time, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under special protection? Saudi Arabia and Egypt are also treated with kid gloves. Again, it is the "Springer-Presse" that excels especially in agitation. We experience this especially on weekends, when these media unite in "Nibelungen-loyalty" with the politicians.
If even the mainstream Christian Social Union (CSU) ministers of the "new and old" federal government try to exclude Islam and use it for their own election purposes, then it becomes very dangerous. Especially I would like to mention the Green Party's Volker Beck, who not only fights at the front line of the Israel lobby, but also gives cheeky free rein to their Turks and Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB) hatred. They defame the mosque association DITIB at every opportunity. For example, in an interview on March 31 with Beck, the DITIB is described by the moderator as "on a short leash" by Erdoğan, who believes that the DITIB must not have a status as a religious community and must have the status of a public corporation. Beck rejects the DITIB as a discussion partner since Ankara always sits at the table.
The other side of the table
Germany has a very good constitution that guarantees undisturbed religious practice and guarantees the freedom of faith and conscience. Unfortunately, I see that the separation of church and state is not so consistently adhered to but rather eroded more and more. So, I think it is more than inappropriate when services take place before political events or Bundestag meetings. In fact, more and more Germans are non-denominational laicists or atheists. So, if people are constantly talking about the "Christian" or "Christian-Jewish" worldview or worse, "values," then I think that is more than questionable.
Islam, in that respect is more than progressive, for after all, Islam, as repeatedly shown by some circles, is compatible with every political order. However, I wonder why a Muslim woman wearing a headscarf who does not want to shake hands with foreign men for cultural reasons is far more critical and disapproving than a kippa-wearing Jewish man who refuses to shake hands with women - so much for the equal treatment of religions.
If Jewish parallel societies are formed, then that is tolerated and do not really integrate, then that is tacitly accepted. A new dangerous phenomenon is to constantly point to growing anti-Semitism and more recently to those who are said to have "Muslim roots." This is a terrible development that I vehemently oppose, not the alleged Muslim anti-Semitism, which is claimed to have been brought into the country by Muslim immigrants, are the conditions, especially in the Jewish state, that promote anti-Semitism.
How can a Muslim person look away when Muslim brothers and sisters in illegally occupied Palestine are brutally murdered for peacefully campaigning for the freedom of Palestine? For 70 years, Palestinians have been denied their legal right to return. In the face of these facts, how can one criticize the fact that the Star of David banner or dummies of it are burned as the symbol of occupation and oppression?
Policy-making without understanding
As the situation escalated on March 30, the memorable day after more than 30,000 Palestinians from Gaza began their "march of return," to be continued until Nakba on May 15, were assassinated by snipers from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). So far, there were 18 Palestinian martyrs and more than 1,400 injured. The humanitarian situation is a disaster and medical care in the hospitals of Gaza unimaginable. In this sealed-off strip of misery there is a lack of everything, including clean drinking water as well as the power supply and medicine. Some 2 million people are living with the blockade. It is a brutal disconnection of land, water and even fresh air. Netanyahu's tear gas drones harass people. The situation reminds me of the previous massacres and the genocide of 2014.
You need to thank Erdoğan for their clear words. Yes, it was a massacre by the IDF and yes, Netanyahu is a terrorist and Israel is a terrorist state. It would be even more important, however, if Turkey acted immediately and provided material and non-material assistance to Gaza. Now, Erdoğan is the only statesman who dares to speak plainly to the rulers of the Jewish state.
Unlike Israel, Turkey is not an occupier state, nor is Israel the only democracy. Actually, Israel is not a democracy. It is downright teasing when Netanyahu repeatedly repeats the phrase claiming the "most moral of all armies," and Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman once again refuses an independent investigation - just like after the Mavi Marmara massacre on May 31, 2010, when the Enlightenment was denied the IDF's brutal killings. Because nothing scares Zionists more than the truth.
Lieberman also rejected demands for an independent investigation of the murderous shots fired at Palestinians on the border with Gaza and was so full of praise for the Jewish "defense soldiers" who only did what was necessary: The soldiers responsible for the massacre, according to Lieberman, should be given even awards.
While Turkey has an exemplary record with more than 3.5 million refugees and has signed a refugee agreement with us to keep the refugees from "necking," the Netanyahu regime despises black refugees and calls them invaders, imprisons them or wants to stop them from sending money to Europe and Africa. Only Jewish refugees are gladly accepted and receive a so-called "right of return," which has been denied to the Palestinians and their descendants since the expulsion, so the regime wants to promote the final solution of Judaization.
The worst part of this unbearable situation was when the new German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas made their "reconciliation trip" to the Jewish state and to Netanyahu, while they had the Palestinians flashed off and spoiled with a "KaDeWe" gift basket. Their comments on Turkey and Russia also promise little good. I already miss the predecessor Sigmar Gabriel, who had just tried to restore a good relationship with Turkey.
I sincerely hope that no hatred should be sown against Muslims and migrants, for those who sow hatred will grow violence.

TAMPA, Fla. — Police in Florida are investigating an incident at a nightclub where a photographer said they were “sucker punched” by singer Chris Brown.
Tampa police spokesperson Stephen Hegarty says 28-year-old Bennie Vines Jr. was hired by Aja Channelside to take photos during an event hosted by Brown.
Vines told officers that while they were snapping photos early Monday, Brown punched him. Brown was gone by the time officers arrived. Vines refused medical treatment and told officers they want to prosecute because of a minor lip cut.
The club confirmed the incident on its Facebook page Monday and apologized to patrons.
Brown, singer of the hits “Run It!” and “Deuces,” completed probation in a 2009 felony assault case for an attack on singer Rihanna, their then-girlfriend.
An email to the representative listed on Brown's website was not immediately returned.
SEOUL: Buses installed with a statue symbolising South Korea's wartime sex slaves began running through the capital Seoul on Monday, a day before the anniversary of independence from Japan's 1910-45 occupation.
Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also other parts of Asia including China, were forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War II.
The plight of the "comfort women" is a hugely emotional issue that has marred ties between the two Asian neighbours for decades. For many South Koreans it epitomises the abuses committed under Japanese rule.
Activists have in recent years set up dozens of statues - typically a young, barefoot girl wearing a traditional hanbok outfit with their hands on their knees - in public venues as a symbol of the victims.
The statues have drawn the ire of Tokyo, which has pressed for the removal of one of them outside its embassy in Seoul after Japan signed a deal with South Korea in December 2015 offering an apology and one billion yen (US$9 million) to open a foundation for those sex slaves still alive.
But the city bus company said it wanted to install statues on five buses running through downtown Seoul to keep the women's memory alive.

"It is designed to remind South Koreans of suffering the women went through," said Rim Jin-Wook, the head of Dong-A Traffic Service that organised the event.
"We wanted to urge people not to forget our painful history," they said, adding the statues would be removed in late September and sent to other public venues for permanent display.
The buses, whenever they pass by the Japanese embassy in central Seoul, play brief explanations about the wartime sex slaves over their audio systems.
"It's so heartbreaking to see this girl statue partly because they look about my age," Jennifer Lee, a 19-year-old college student, told AFP. "It horrifies me just to imagine what these women went through."

Last month, the new South Korean government under President Moon Jae-In launched a task force to investigate potential problems in the deal with Tokyo concerning the comfort women.
Reached by the administration of ousted President Park Geun-Hye, the agreement was condemned by some of the women and activists who took issue with Japan's refusal to accept legal responsibility and questioned the sincerity of its apology.
Activists are now pushing for Seoul to designate Aug 14 - a day before the anniversary of the country's independence - as a state memorial day for former comfort women.
England's hopes of clawing their way back into an Ashes series fast slipping from their grip will be put to the ultimate test at the WACA where the tourists have won only once in nearly 50 years.
MELBOURNE: England's hopes of clawing their way back into an Ashes series fast slipping from their grip will be put to the ultimate test at the WACA where the tourists have won only once in nearly 50 years.
The WACA bore witness to the meek surrender of the 2013/14 series by Alastair Cook's England, and at 2-0 down after Brisbane and Adelaide, Joe Root's men face a similar predicament when the third test starts on Thursday.
With its traditionally quick and bouncy wicket playing to the strengths of home pacemen, the WACA has been a house of pain for English cricket and Australians will be hoping for more of the same when the ground hosts its final test.
One has to delve deep in the records to even find the last time England drew a match.
That was in 1986, when Mike Gatting's unlikely band of hard-partying tourists put on 592 in the first innings to frustrate Allan Border's team.
The maiden win was in 1978 when Mike Brearley's side thrashed Graham Yallop-captained Australia by 166 runs, a victory that might otherwise have been remembered as a triumph of English cricket but for the fact that the hosts had been gutted by the World Series Cricket rebellion.

Australia have beaten England in their last seven matches at the WACA and with the hosts' pacemen licking their lips, it may take something truly special from Joe Root's men just to keep the series alive to the Boxing Day test in Melbourne.
Managing that would be a victory of sorts, given England need only to square the five-test series at 2-2 to keep the coveted urn.
Having fought hard but ultimately crumbled at both the Gabba and the Adelaide Oval, England's chances of rallying at the WACA have been given short shrift by bookmakers.
Their week has also included further off-field problems with coach Trevor Bayliss left fuming after English Lions batsman Ben Duckett poured a drink over the head of James Anderson in a Perth bar.
And yet, a small increase in application by the tourists could ensure a contest at the WACA.
England have paid dearly for a few dreadful sessions and the scoreline has, to an extent, flattered Steve Smith's Australia.
The vulnerability of the home side's batting was on full display in the second innings at Adelaide Oval as they crashed out for 133 to raise England's hopes of an unlikely victory.
Several of Australia's batsmen are under pressure, most notably number five Peter Handscomb whose place could be taken by Mitchell Marsh, an all-rounder with a poor batting record at test level.
Anderson and the England seamers, meanwhile, will have enjoyed a boost of confidence from Adelaide, where Craig Overton provided much better support than Jake Ball at the Gabba.
More will be needed from the English batsmen, though, given none have managed a century this series.
Root and their most senior batsman Alastair Cook have been particularly culpable for failing to set the benchmark by converting promising starts into big scores.
Both were present for England's last capitulation at the WACA and will be desperate to make a contribution to avoiding another.

Tourism bosses are anticipating a bumper period of trade in spring 2017 as holidaymakers take advantage of a pair of bank holiday weekends just two weeks apart.
Many workers in the UK will be able to take an 18-day break by using just nine days of their annual leave allowance between Good Friday on April 14 and the May Day bank holiday on May 1.
This quirk of the 2017 calendar means a number of destinations holding events during that period could see a boost in visitors.
Celebrations to mark the anniversary of William Shakespeare's birthday are taking place in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire on April 22 and 23, while the six-day Cheltenham Jazz Festival in Gloucestershire begins on April 26.
Scottish whisky lovers can head to Strathspey for the Spirit Of Speyside festival starting on April 27, and cycling fans can cheer on the riders in the Tour de Yorkshire from April 29.
Patricia Yates, director of national tourism agency VisitBritain, said : " Record numbers of Brits have been taking holidays at home this year and we anticipate that this will continue in 2017 due to the certainty of budgeting for a domestic holiday and the sheer diversity of events and attractions on offer.
"The Easter break and May bank holiday weekend are a chance for people to make the most of their annual leave dates and enjoy a great British holiday whether on a seaside, countryside or city break."
Holidaymakers will also be able to take advantage of a favourable time off to annual leave ratio over the 2017 festive period.
With December 23 and 24 falling on a weekend, many workers will be able to enjoy 10 days off between Christmas and New Year by booking just three days off from December 27-29.
Bank and public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave, meaning employers can choose to include them as part of their employees' statutory annual leave allowance of 28 days per year.
Kelowna RCMP have released a photo of an armed robber, hoping the public might be able to identify him.
The robbery happened last Thursday at the Subway restaurant on Lawrence Avenue.
Police said the suspect was armed with a gun and got away with some cash.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male, approximately 5′ 7″ tall, of slender build, seen wearing dark pants, dark shoes, and a black jacket with the hood over their head.
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi rejected suggestions that they might do a deal with President Joseph Kabila, at a rally which passed off peacefully on Tuesday.

Tshisekedi is one of two main figures expected to seek to run in a delayed election scheduled for December. Exiled business person Moise Katumbi is the other.
Tshisekedi dismissed speculation they might accept the post of prime minister, something Kabila has offered in the past to appease opponents.
“There is nothing like any dialogue for a prime ministerial post,” Tshisekedi told the cheering crowd.
“The (party) elected me to be presidential candidate, so how can I be lowered to prime minister? Rather, let me be led to the final victory in the presidential election.”
Kabila's opposition is weak and divided. Many opposition politicians joined a power-sharing government after the death of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, Felix's father, last year.
Dozens have died in protests, most shot dead by security forces, since Kabila refused to step down at the end of their constitutional mandate in December 2016. But Tuesday's rally was unusual in that it was permitted, watched closely by armed police.
Popular anger could easily boil over if elections are delayed again or are not perceived to be fair. In addition, several parts of the country are dealing with armed rebellions.
Donors have expressed concern about plans to use new electronic voting machines, saying the system is untested and could allow fraud. Congo's government reacted by saying it would reject foreign aid for the poll.
“Their machine is a machine to cheat. The electoral register is corrupt and merits a serious audit,” Tshisekedi said.
The electoral commission has denied accusations of bias.

The Long Beach rapper made what's considered to be the world's largest glass of gin and juice this past weekend at the BottleRock Napa Valley festival.
According to Mercury News, the drink was 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide, and was made up of 550 liters of juice donated by Whole Foods, as well as 180 bottles of Hendricks gin.
Warren G and Top Chef winner Michael Voltaggio helped Snoop with the elixir, which was an homage to their 1994 hit “Gin and Juice.” Once the drank was done, Guinness even gifted Snoop with a certificate for their record-breaking achievement.

BURQIN, West Bank: Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian teenager during an arrest raid in the village of Burqin in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian health officials said on Saturday.
A Reuters witness said about 200 Palestinians were throwing stones at Israeli military vehicles when a shot was heard, adding that a wounded person was then carried to a car.
Israel's military, which said it was checking the report, said its forces had been searching in Burqin for suspects involved in the fatal drive-by shooting of an Israeli rabbi from a nearby settlement on Jan. 9.
Israeli forces in the adjacent city of Jenin last month shot and killed a Palestinian gunman whom they suspected of involvement in the rabbi's shooting.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the teenager killed on Saturday was 19 years old, while the hospital in Jenin where they were taken said they had been shot in the head.
The Israeli military said rioting had broken out while troops were apprehending several suspects connected with the shooting of the rabbi and troops had responded with non-fatal "riot dispersal means".

Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December, since when at least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed.
Trump's reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who want to create an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.
U.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump's administration to restart negotiations has shown no real signs of progress.

A new group is being launched by the organisation which plans and buys health services in North Lincolnshire to ensure it fully involves patients and members of the public in its future plans.
The NHS North Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is now looking for people to join its patient and community assurance group (PCAG).
Janice Keilthy, the lay member of the CCG governing body responsible for public and patient involvement, said: “Making sure local people are fully aware of and understand what is happening with their NHS services is very important to us.
“We always aim to work very closely with staff, patients, stakeholders and members of the public when we plan our services as well as fully consult with our local communities before making any big decisions that involve changing the way they access treatment or care.
“The PCAG will serve as an independent group that will work with us to make sure we take every opportunity to really involve patients and members of the public in our plans and decisions.
“Because of the current challenges faced by the NHS in North Lincolnshire, there is no better time to get involved and I would encourage anyone with a real interest in health to consider taking up this opportunity.”

SINGAPORE: Pearls, now beloved of young trendsetters, are no longer the exclusive domain of turtlenecked tai tais.
This season, the lustrous little orbs are much in demand. As anyone who has been shopping the high street or binge-watching Netflix's The Crown will tell you – you can't throw a crumpet on that show without hitting a female royal dripping in pearls. And who could forget how formidable the Queen looked in that standout green dress and pearls?
Even if you don't have courtly aspirations, the allure of pearl jewellery is clear: The way it reflects light off your face makes it the perfect accessory for subtle elegance. And for the professional woman who wants to up their game, it might be time to splash out on some real pearls.
Nothing like a pearl necklace to feel like royalty. (Photo: Netflix)
But with so many varieties of pearls and wannabe pearls out there, how should a self-respecting fashionista go about selecting a really good piece of pearl jewellery? The options can be confusing.

Thankfully, we got a crash course in the subject from gemologists Loke Hui Ying and Tay Kunming, director and managing director of educational gemstone and mineral museum The Gem Museum.
Hopefully their tips come in handy. Just in case you get that invite to Princess Charlotte's brother's christening or Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding…
***
Q. What factors should I look at when buying pearls?
Consider the shape and lustre of the pearl. The rounder and more glowing the pearl, the more valuable it is. With a really good lustre, Loke says, you can even see your face reflected on the surface.
Not all pearls are created equal: the Australia South Sea pearl (left) has very good lustre and little blemishes, while the Burma South Sea pearl has good lustre and moderate blemishes.
Then there are colours. Even pearls that appear white to the eye can have silver, cream, blue or pink tones. The whiter the pearl, the more expensive.
Q. How much should I be paying?
There is no real answer to this one – prices range vastly because of the various types of pearls that exist. You could get a strand of freshwater pearls for a couple of dollars, or a better quality one for S$100. You could also fork out upwards of a few thousand for a strand of South Sea pearls.

South Sea pearls, which tend to be rounder, are more expensive because they are grown from oysters. The oysters require a sheltered bay with just enough current, and these exist only in a few places in the world, including in countries such as Australia, the Philippines and Myanmar. They are also at the mercy of natural disasters ranging from hurricanes to jellyfish invasions.
An example of a South Sea pearl is the Akoya pearl, which is found mostly in Japan and China and is known for its lustre, as “there are processing methods that the Japanese are very good at,” Tay says.
Freshwater pearls, which are more affordable, are grown from mussels, which have a higher survival rate than oysters. Also, each mussel can yield up to 10 times as many pearls as an oyster. Freshwater pearls are largely grown in China, where advancing technology is increasingly producing rounder and more lustrous pearls.

All the pearls in the market are cultivated pearls, Tay says. Natural pearls from the Arabian gulf do exist, but you are unlikely to be able to purchase them thanks to their extreme scarcity.
Q. How do I choose a good seller?
Firstly, make sure the jeweller has credentials, Tay says. They should have a diploma in gemology. Secondly, consider their reputation – if you're not sure, ask around.
Is it worth paying more for brand-name pearls? Tay thinks so. You aren't just paying for the brand, they explain, but for the uniformity and symmetry of the pearls in your necklace, which takes time and labour to achieve. Established jewellers such as Mikimoto or Tiffany “do a lot of selection. One harvest takes about 18 months to complete. Sometimes, one harvest is not enough to find pearls of the same size.”

You are also paying for an established brand's decades of research, reliability and history. Remember how US First Lady Melania Trump visited the Mikimoto store during the Trumps' official visit to Tokyo in November? The brand receives support from the Japanese government because it is a part of the nation's heritage.
Q. Is it important to have a certificate for my pearls?
Generally, the answer is no. “Diamonds are certified so that you know if they are natural or synthetic. But pearls are cultivated,” Tay says – so the certificate would not be giving you any useful information.
Q. How can I tell the difference between real and fake pearls?
At costume jewellery stores, the pieces are often made from “shell pearls”, which are carved out from the shell of the giant clam. A strand of these can cost around S$30 or S$40 dollars. “When you hold it in your hand, it feels very heavy,” Tay says.
An example of imitation pearl earrings. The magnified view highlights multiple scratches and pitted surface, due to the coating, which could be paint or guanine coating. (Photos: The Gem Museum)
Other costume pieces can be made of plastic or glass. “You can tell by looking at the surface,” Loke says, which may look as if it has been painted. Most real pearls have natural blemishes, but these are not evenly distributed. “Another trick is to look at the hole that has been drilled in. The paint usually accumulates around the drill hole.”
Q. Any other tips?
Ask the salesperson to show you the most expensive piece in the shop, as well as the least expensive piece, Tay suggests. Comparing these will give you an idea of their quality. “When it comes to gems and jewellery, our eyes often need to be trained. Take the best and the worst, and then find something in between.”
Ulaanbaatar: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Tuesday arrived in Mongolia, becoming the first Indian foreign minister to visit the resouce-rich country in 42 years.
Swaraj was received by Deputy Foreign Minister of Mongolia B Battsetseg at the airport.
 They are scheduled to hold bilateral talks to further strengthen political, strategic, economic, educational and cultural ties in the predominantly Buddhist nation.
"First visit of an Indian External Affairs Minister to Mongolia in 42 years! Reconnecting with our shared Buddhist heritage, Swaraj warmly received by Deputy Foreign Minister of Mongolia, B Battsetseg on their arrival in sunny Ulaanbaatar," tweeted Raveesh Kumar, official Spokesperson at the Ministry of External Affairs.
Swaraj, who is on a two-day visit to Mongolia, will co-chair the 6th round of India-Mongolia Joint Consultative Committee meeting with Foreign Minister D Tsogtbaatar. Swaraj is the first external affairs minister in 42 years to visit Mongolia.
India and Mongolia have close cooperation in trade and economy, science, health, agriculture, culture, education, communication and tourism. The two countries are also working closely to ensure security and curbing international crimes and terrorism. The total trade between the two countries amounted to $ 25.6 million in 2016.
During their visit, Swaraj is also scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the Kushok Bakula Birth Centenary Celebrations in Ulaanbaatar commemorating the birth anniversary of Late Venerable Kushok Bakula Rinpoche, a highly revered Buddhist leader and monk from Ladakh and a former Ambassador of India to Mongolia.
Bakula Rinpoche, the longest serving Indian Ambassador to Mongolia, made seminal contribution to promotion of India-Mongolia ties.
Swaraj earlier visited China where they participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting and on Sunday held wide-ranging bilateral talks with their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.
CAIRO: Russian President Vladimir Putin and their Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdoğan will discuss a possible political resolution to the Syrian crisis when they meet, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.
Peskov said the two leaders would also discuss preparations for the work of the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - an event Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and the opposition.

SINGAPORE: From an old skate park to a multipurpose building with a range of facilities bringing different services together under one roof, Heartbeat@Bedok aims to serve as a lifestyle hub for residents of all ages.
The seven storey building, with a land area that makes up the size of about three football fields, was officially open on Sunday (Feb 4) by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Heartbeat@Bedok houses multiple agencies managing different facilities, such as the sports centre, the Bedok public library, Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, Bedok Polyclinic and a Senior Care Centre that has yet to open.
There are also more than 30 retailers including F&B outlets, sports specialty shops and childcare and education centres. The amenities have been opening in phases from July 2017.
Rain or shine, sport enthusiasts will not have to worry about working out, with four swimming pools featuring aqua related programmes, as well as eight indoor badminton courts and six sheltered tennis courts on the rooftop.

The concept of Heartbeat@Bedok is almost similar to Our Tampines Hub, and Grassroots advisor Lee Yi Shyan said: “When we started to brainstorm on this idea, we never knew the Tampines Hub was in parallel, being developed. It was a pure coincidence. It was only much later that we realised”.
Mr Lee added that it's a more efficient use of land now that all the public facilities are congregated together in one place.
“In the past, we had all the amenities in a distributed fashion. The community centre was at one place, the library and polyclinic at another place.
"When we had a chance to rebuild, we thought it might be a good idea to bring everyone under one roof so that residents can access all these service within short distances. In terms of the freed up land, it's important to provide new housing options for young families to inject a younger population into this otherwise rather matured and also older demographics”.
With the amenities brought together, Mr Lee also said that this allows the agencies to do more than just providing services for the residents, but also come together to organise integrated programmes. They said it is a requirement that all the agencies have a minimum of 40 per cent of their services to be co-delivered at Heartbeat.
The polyclinic, for example, has been working with People's Association to refer its patients for healthy cooking classes, and it also collaborated with ActiveSG to send some patients for a gym orientation.
“We want to create a healthy ecosystem for our patients beyond the borders of our clinic. These referrals are mainly aimed at patients with chronic and lifestyle diseases so they can learn to pick up healthier habits and be less sedentary. We look forward to scaling up such tie-ups with the other agencies here so that patients that come to us are also healthier and it becomes a win win situation,” said Dr Juliana Bahadin, Clinic Director, Bedok Polyclinic.
To ensure the Heartbeat meets the needs of residents, a series of consultation were launched with some 11,000 people to get ideas and feedback on the type of programmes they would like.
According to Mr Lee, about 14 to 18 per cent of residents in Bedok are aged 65 and above. Hence, many of the activities at Heartbeat are related to social and physical wellness.

An angry Manchester United fan launched an astonishing tirade pointing out Jose Mourinho's failings following defeat in the Manchester derby.
The Red Devils were beaten 2-1 at Old Trafford on Sunday, as Pep Guardiola's side extended their lead to 11 points at the top of the Premier League.
Fans were unhappy at the way their team lined up negatively at home, and one supporter lost their cool in an interview with The United Stand after the game.
Slamming the entire team, the fan, who actually interrupted another interview, shouted: "F*** Lukaku off lad, Herrera. What type of midfielder is Herrera?
(Image: The United Stand)
"He's not a box-to-box, he's not a defensive, they can't do a f****** killer pass, what are they on the f****** pitch for?"
Discussing Mourinho's tactics, they added: "City have come here and f****** bossed us at Old Trafford. This is Man United we're talking about. City have come here and f****** bossed us.
(Image: REUTERS)
"We've hoofed it, Rojo, we got lucky on the f****** goal, what were their [Mourinho's] tactics? As soon as you get it Rojo just f****** boot it!?"
"We're not f****** Stoke, we're Man-f******-United, we should be battering f****** them. That was diabolical out there. Hoof, hoof, hoof."

High-tech innovation available in Kenya from LG that you can take home
LG is one of the high-tech companies that showcase their promising yet sometimes peculiar concepts at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).
CES, if you've never heard of it, is the world's biggest consumer tech event. This year's event took place earlier in the year in Las Vegas. At the CES 2018 event, LG made headlines by previewing their 88 –inch 8K television; the world is still learning how fully operate a 4K television so an 8K TV is a big deal.
However, that tech won't be available in Kenya for quite some time but there are still a few high-tech LG products you can buy.

The refrigerator is world-renowned for its innovative glass panel, revolutionary knock-on feature that reduces cold air loss, and sleek, premium design. Conventional refrigerators often sport ordinary doors with ice dispensers but LG's InstaView Door-in-Door is a first in the industry with its never-before-seen 33-inch sleek glass panel and an array of innovative features.
Janghoon Chung, Managing Director of LG Electronics East Africa, has said that the high-tech smart home device is the definition of a premium appliance, balancing innovation, style, and efficiency. It is set to transform how users interact with refrigerators.

KADUNA, Nigeria: Talba Goni has been trying without luck to get government funds or loans to restart a textile plant in Kaduna, the former industrial heartland in northern Nigeria, that they were running until it closed almost 15 years ago.
"We were not able to meet up with those conditions to access the funding ... the bureaucracy, you have to give this, you have to give that," they said. "There should be concessions, like the company income tax, a waiver for about 3-4 years."
Most importantly, Goni is unable to get enough petrol to power the plant's generators as the major oil producing country grapples with fuel shortages due to its derelict refineries.
"We can't operate without black oil (petrol), it's very expensive and also very scarce," they said.
President Muhammadu Buhari hopes to revive the once flourishing textile and leather industries in northern Nigeria to end the country's dependence on oil exports and diversify Africa's biggest economy.
But a collapse in vital oil revenues has pushed the West African nation into its first recession in 25 years, making it difficult to provide state loans or improve the erratic power supply that has led to closure of most plants.
Adding further woes, a central bank decision to keep the naira currency at a high rate versus the dollar has deterred foreign investors fearing to get caught eventually in yet another devaluation .
There have been some limited Chinese investments in recent years into what is left of Nigeria's leather and textile industry, but most plants have remained closed since throwing in the towel in the 1980s and 1990s.
Goni said they had to fire 2,500 workers, joining an army of unemployed from which Boko Haram jihadists waging an insurgency in the northeast have been recruiting.
"We are getting the people out of the woods," they said. "Once we are able to start the factory, we will solve a lot of this problem of unemployment."

Officials with the Coast Guard say federal and state authorities are continuing to investigate a potential threat which was reported at the Wando Terminal Wednesday night.
Coast Guard officials say the FBI is investigating a report of a "dirty bomb" aboard a vessel.
A dirty bomb is composed of conventional explosives and radioactive material.
According to emergency officials, no radiation has been found at this time.
A report by the Coast Guard states that at 8 p.m. authorities were made aware of a potential threat in a container aboard the vessel Maersk Memphis.
"The Maersk Memphis is currently moored at Charleston's Wando terminal which has been evacuated while bomb detection units from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies investigate the threat," Coast Guard officials said.
The Coast Guard says a unified command has been established to oversee the coordinated response.
Witnesses say the terminal was evacuated, and authorities were seen taping off a ship.
The Charleston County Sheriff's Office, Hazmat and EMS crews are also on scene.
Workers say they have since been sent home, and were told to leave the terminal around 9 p.m.
Boaters say they were also escorted off the water due to the situation.

LONDON: Newcastle United stayed top of the English Championship (second tier) as Jamaal Lascelles grabbed an 81st-minute equaliser to salvage a 2-2 draw at Norwich City on Tuesday.
Second-placed Brighton & Hove Albion were also held, drawing 1-1 at home to Ipswich Town to leave them one point behind Rafa Benitez's leaders with 15 games of the season remaining.
Newcastle went ahead after 23 seconds through Ayoze Perez, but the match was turned on its head as Jacob Murphy and Cameron Jerome scored to give Norwich the lead inside 17 minutes.
Newcastle dominated the second half but had to wait until the final 10 minutes to draw level as Lascelles's left-footed effort at the far post secured a point to put them on 66, with Norwich one place outside the playoff spots on 51.
Brighton missed the chance to go top after falling behind in the ninth minute to a Luke Chambers effort before Tomer Hemed levelled with their sixth goal in five league games after 29.
Their failure to claim all three points, however, allowed third-placed Huddersfield Town (61 points) to close the gap on the top two to four points with a 3-2 victory at bottom club Rotherham United thanks to a stoppage-time Tommy Smith winner.
Fourth-placed Reading (60 points) also won 3-2 at home to Brentford, while Leeds United (57) in fifth beat visitors Bristol City 2-1. Sheffield Wednesday (55), in sixth, won by the same score at home to Blackburn Rovers.
Former European champions Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa lost to leave them floundering in the bottom half of the table.
Forest were beaten 3-2 at Fulham to leave them 17th, a place below Villa who also have 36 points after losing 3-1 at home to Barnsley.

Argentine great Diego Maradona said England perpetrated a "monumental robbery" in their World Cup victory over Colombia and accused referee Mark Geiger of not being up to such a game.
NIZNHY NOVGOROD, Russia: Argentine great Diego Maradona said England perpetrated a "monumental robbery" in their World Cup victory over Colombia and accused referee Mark Geiger of not being up to such a game.
Maradona, notorious in England for their famous 'Hand of God' goal at the 1986 tournament, said the American official should have penalised Harry Kane rather than give a penalty for a foul by Colombia's Carlos Sanchez during Tuesday's knockout match

"Today I saw a monumental robbery on the pitch... a fatal mistake for a whole country," they said of the incident that put England 1-0 ahead in the second half.
"Here's a gentleman who decides, a referee who, if you Google him, shouldn't be given a match of this magnitude... Geiger, an American, what a coincidence," Maradona added on their nightly World Cup show for Venezuela-based Telesur broadcaster.
TV images showed Maradona wildly celebrating Colombia's late equaliser that took Tuesday's Round of 16 match to 1-1 and extra time. But they were despondent when England won a penalty shootout, taking them into a quarter-final against Sweden.
The ever-controversial former World Cup winner also pointed the finger at Pierluigi Collina, head of FIFA's referee committee, for allowing Geiger's designation.

"I'm just sorry for the whole Colombian people," Maradona said. "I cheered Colombia's goal as if I had headed it myself."

Gwyneth Paltrow selects movies which have the "best return on investment in terms of time and impact".
The 'Mortdecai' star knows they "doesn't do a lot of acting right now" but they are very selective about their projects as they want the best "return on investment".
Speaking as they collected the Sun Valley Film Festival Vision Award, they said: "I don't do a lot of acting right now, so when I do I look for what's going to have the best return on investment in terms of time and impact. It's fun to do something like 'The Avengers'. I get to go to Atlanta for two days, see my friends, do a scene with Robert [Downey Jr.], come home."
Meanwhile, Gwyneth previously confessed they still question their decision to put acting on the back burner.
Asked about their decision to reduce their acting commitments so they could start up their lifestyle brand Goop, they said: "I need to be here right now. I went to Atlanta to do Avengers 4, so I'm in and out for that, and it's weird to go back and forth. We're growing fast, and balls are dropping all the time. But honestly, I was on set and thought, 'You sit here for two hours sipping tea, Robert Downey Jr. and Don Cheadle are making me laugh hysterically - why the hell did I give this up?'"
Acting has also given Gwen some business lessons too.
They shared: "When you are an actor on a set, an unspoken component of your role is an energetic one to maintain balance and communication, which is a very feminine impulse. For me, when I'm on set, I try to make sure the energy is clean and people can communicate in a safe space, and that's what I bring to my leadership here at Goop, too."

With the last six majors producing six first-time winners and fitness concerns hanging over some of golf's biggest names, there is an air of uncertainty whistling through the knee high fescue at this year's U.S. Open.
Adding to the unpredictability is the venue Erin Hills, a sprawling links style layout nestled in the bucolic Wisconsin countryside, that will be making its major debut.
At a monstrous 7,741 yards Erin Hills will be the first par 72 U.S. Open since 1992 at Pebble Beach.
"We are excited about this site," said Mike Davis, executive director of the United States Golf Association. "We really do believe Erin Hills meets all of the criteria.

"When we looked at Erin Hills we looked at what the test of golf would be.
"We think it is a good test. A different kind of test."
Reigning U.S. Open champion Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson kept the golf world guessing whether they would or would not be in Erin Hills this week.
Johnson ended that speculation on Tuesday when they arrived in time for a practise round after partner Paulina Gretzky had given birth to their second child.
Mickelson, however, who needs a U.S. Open victory to complete a career grand slam, was going to take it down to the wire, hoping enough rain and bad weather will delay Thursday's start to allow them to attend their daughter's graduation and fly from San Diego to Erin in time for their 2:20 PM CT (1920 GMT).
Major winners world number one Johnson, Northern Irishman number two Rory McIlroy and Australian number three Jason Day all are big hitters and come to a layout that should favour them. But there are questions over their form.
"I mean the golf course I really like it," said Johnson, who is trying to become the first repeat champion since Curtis Strange in 1989. "It's a typical U.S. Open venue where the fact is that you have to hit the fairways. You can't really play from the rough.
"It's a difficult championship to win. It always plays very difficult."
Johnson, who missed the U.S. Masters after hurting their back, failed to make the halfway cut at the Memorial tournament last week while McIlroy has not played in nearly a month, since reporting back problems at the Players Championship.
Day, who pulled out of the WGC Dell Match Play to be with mother while they battled cancer, has slowly found some form following a tie for 60th at the Players with a runnerup finish at the Byron Nelson.
American young guns world number five Jordan Spieth, the 2015 U.S. Open winner, and number nine Rickie Fowler, zeroing in on a maiden major, will spearhead the American charge along with Johnson.
An American has hoisted the trophy the last two years and a strong international field will be determined to prevent a U.S. hat-trick of titles.
Masters champion Sergio Garcia of Spain and runner-up Justin Rose of England drive the ball just about as well as anyone, as does Australian Adam Scott, while South Africans Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen are always a threat.

Connecticut's average gas price today is $2.48, three cents higher than this time last week. Compared to this time last year, average prices are $.24 cents higher.
Nationally, average prices have increased for 20 consecutive days with today's price of $2.41, $.02 cents higher than this time last week; and $.30 cents higher than this time last year.
Average prices typically increase this time of year with the onset of the summer drive season, warmer weather and the conversion to more expensive summer blends. This year contributing to that increase are reports of possible extended production cuts by OPEC and a decline in oil inventories that American motorists have enjoyed over the last year or so.
AAA's weekly survey of prices in Connecticut's four regional areas as follows:
Greater Bridgeport/Stamford $2.54
New Haven/Meriden $2.46
Greater Hartford $2.46
New London/Norwich $2.47
Statewide average $2.48
Today, South Carolina continues to register the lowest average in the nation at $2.13, followed by Mississippi at $2.08. Hawaii continues to lead the nation with the highest prices at $3.06, followed by California at $3.01. Connecticut has moved down to 13th place from 12th as the state with the highest prices in the nation.

Prosecutors in Peru have uncovered new evidence that implicates a Canadian man, who was lynched in the Amazon last week, in the slaying of a revered indigenous medicine woman, a spokesperson for the attorney general's office said on Tuesday.
LIMA: Prosecutors in Peru have uncovered new evidence that implicates a Canadian man, who was lynched in the Amazon last week, in the slaying of a revered indigenous medicine woman, a spokesperson for the attorney general's office said on Tuesday.
Sebastian Woodroffe, 41, had bought a pistol a little over two weeks before the medicine woman, Olivia Arevalo, was shot dead near their home in the jungle region of Ucayali, said Ricardo Jimenez, the president of a regional group of prosecutors.
A witness has testified that a silver-coloured pistol fell from a backpack Woodroffe was carrying when villagers angry over Arevalo's death grabbed them before lynching him, Jimenez said.
"We want to see if that weapon actually existed. We haven't found it yet but we're looking for it," Jimenez said on a brief press conference by telephone.
"With the new evidence that has appeared, they are the main suspect," Jimenez later told Reuters by text message.
Jimenez said prosecutors believe Woodroffe may have killed Arevalo because their son owed them 14,000 soles (US$4,335).

Neither Woodroffe's nor Arevalo's family could be reached for comment.
Arevalo's slaying prompted outrage as it followed the unsolved killings or attacks on other indigenous people in the Amazon who had sought to defend native lands from encroachment by illegal loggers, miners and drug traffickers.
Policing is scant over much of the Peruvian Andes and Amazon and villagers in far-flung provinces often punish accused criminals according to local customs.
On Monday, a Peruvian judge ordered the arrests of two men accused of lynching Woodroffe. No arrests had been made by early on Tuesday.

The following essay was submitted to The Hockey Writers by Calvin White in response to our earlier piece, “Why the Blues Should Sign Jaromir Jagr,” written by our own James Gaughan.
While non-sports fans will not care, nor even know about, NHL legend Jaromir Jagr's so-far-failing quest to play another NHL season in which they will turn 46 years old, and sports fans will have a restricted view that it is a “hockey” stalemate, perhaps there is a deeper societal issue at play.
Currently, we are all hyper-alerted to how racism, sexism, and identity discrimination emerges, and the raucous denunciations are quick to result. Maybe with Jagr's plight, we are watching a clear example of ageism. And perhaps, a bit of ethnocentric discrimination.
Jaromir Jagr's Worth
Jagr is, and has been, a phenomenon. They continuously garner terms like legendary, ageless wonder, incredible, and exemplary. No one disputes their level of physical fitness and their attitude to game preparation. With the second highest number of career points in NHL history, they are acknowledged as a certain first ballot Hall of Famer.
This past season they scored 16 goals and played all 82 games while having to play with a variety of line-mates due to injuries to their normal ones. The previous season they scored 27 goals in 79 games. The past two seasons their plus/minus is positive, which means they have been on the ice for more goals for their team than against. Stats show their puck possession is strong, and all commentators mention how difficult it is to get the puck from them due to their lower body strength and their experience. They seldom misses games from injury.
This past season, they made sports highlight reels with a “wow” play in which they stole the puck behind the net from 25-year-old defenceman, Josh Manson, of the Anaheim Ducks and in several nifty moves scored an unassisted goal.
So, obviously, the stellar Jagr can still play at an elite level. In addition, all reports say that teammates like him, that they share knowledge abundantly, that their attitude in the locker room is great and that they inspire. So, too do they draw fans.
Ageism Hurting Jagr
Yet, as the off-season moves closer to training camps, no teams are making offers to sign him? Lesser players, by anyone's assessment, are being signed and at rewarding salaries and contract term lengths, while Jagr is not getting a sniff. Something is amiss! And it's the age factor. Not age as in can't do it hurts the team, but in age as age.
Simply put, it bothers NHL coaches and management that someone so old can compete so well in a “young man's” game that is riding on the impending glories of young superstars, Connor McDavid -20 years old and Auston Matthews – 19 years old. It's bad for the brand, so to speak.
This last season, for instance, a reporter asked Jagr if they would have a 45-year-old playing on the number one line of the Kladno team that they own in the Czech premier league. Such a disrespectful question clearly embarrassed him, and they replied that coaches make line decisions. The question was ageist because it directly implied there was something wrong with a 45-year-old being in such prominence. Imagine if the reporter had asked a black or gay player the same question.
As well, many in the coaching and management circles are former players. It is not a stretch to wonder if it galls them that Jagr can keep playing at such a high level and that they want to keep playing rather than “bowing out gracefully” which they all were forced to do because of diminishing skills or desire. In other words, somewhere in their psyche do they feel they make them look less than?
Plus, Jagr is a Czech. He's not a good old Canadian boy or an American cousin, but a “foreigner”, a Euro. And according to on-air comments by TSN analyst and former goalie, Jamie McLennan who once played with Jagr, he's a fantastic player but a “strange sort of dude”. How does all of that sit with the North American old boy's network?
Jagr Deserving of a Spot
Now the one seemingly reasonable explanation offered for the reluctance to sign a player capable of putting up 20 goals and adding to team chemistry and leadership is that Jagr is too slow. Throughout the past season, this was never brought up, but each of their record breaking feats were and the fan adulation was.
Every team has a mix of faster and slower players. The too slow argument would only hold ice if other teams had no skaters of Jagr's speed on their top two lines.
Similarly, the refrain that “we're going younger” sounds good at first glance but falls apart when reality shows that every team wants players who can score 20 goals and not have a negative plus/minus. Everyone also knows that youth does not guarantee year after year performance. No one disagrees that Jagr's pedigree and track record indicate that a 20 goal level in the coming season is a fairly good bet especially with consistent line mates.
A team may still come to its senses and snap up the legend, but right now the only conclusion to be drawn is that there is a distinct prejudice against age.

WASHINGTON: Defence Secretary Jim Mattis warned Monday (Aug 14) that an attack by North Korea against the United States could quickly escalate into war, as they and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to dial down tensions.
North Korea last week said it was drawing up plans to test-fire four missiles that would fly toward Guam but splash into the sea before hitting the small US Pacific island territory, after President Donald Trump promised to meet ongoing threats from Pyongyang with "fire and fury."
"If they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly," Mattis told Pentagon reporters.
Mattis' comments came after they and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said America has "no interest" in regime change in Pyongyang or the accelerated reunification of the two Koreas, and stressed the importance of a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
The two statesmen decided to write the piece a couple of weeks ago, and it had not been in response to last week's heated rhetoric, Mattis said.
"We were thinking it would be wise to put out something that shows how the State Department and the Defence Department work together, it's not one or the other, it's the two working together," they said.

Mattis and Tillerson said the United States favors a diplomatic solution to the nuclear stand-off, especially with help from China, though they stressed diplomacy is "backed by military options."
"The US has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea," Mattis and Tillerson wrote.
"We do not seek an excuse to garrison US troops north of the Demilitarised Zone. We have no desire to inflict harm on the long-suffering North Korean people, who are distinct from the hostile regime in Pyongyang."
Mattis and Tillerson called on China, which is North Korea's main trading partner and ally, to take advantage of an "unparalleled opportunity" to assert its influence on Pyongyang.
"If China wishes to play a more active role in securing regional peace and stability - from which all of us, especially China, derive such great benefit - it must make the decision to exercise its decisive diplomatic and economic leverage over North Korea," the US officials wrote.
Mattis and Tillerson also credited UN efforts and said the United States was willing to negotiate with North Korea, but said Pyongyang should indicate a desire to show good faith by halting weapons and nuclear tests.
General Joseph Dunford, who chairs the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and is the nation's top uniformed military officer, met on Monday with South Korea's defense minister Song Young-Moo and defense chief General Lee Sun-Jin.
They "conveyed America's readiness to use the full range of military capabilities to defend our allies and the US homeland," said spokesperson Captain Darryn James.

Brighton & Hove Albion secured their first Premier League win this year as they beat West Ham United 3-1 thanks to superb strikes from Jose Izquierdo and Pascal Gross in a thrilling game at the Amex Stadium.
REUTERS: Brighton & Hove Albion secured their first Premier League win this year as they beat West Ham United 3-1 thanks to superb strikes from Jose Izquierdo and Pascal Gross in a thrilling game at the Amex Stadium.
Brighton's Glenn Murray opened the scoring with their eighth league goal of the season but Javier Hernandez, who said they had wanted to leave the club ahead of the January transfer deadline, equalised before the break after jinking past three defenders.
But Brighton's second-half goals were stunning. First Jose Izquierdo rocketed a shot past West Ham keeper Adrian from the edge of the area after 59 minutes and then Pascal Gross capped a fine display by scoring from 25 metres in the 75th.
West Ham's midweek signing from Preston North End, striker Jordan Hugill, came off the bench but Brighton held on to complete their first league double over West Ham and move level with the 12th placed visitors on 27 points.

WATERLOO REGION — Most of Toronto's new streetcars built by Bombardier must be sent back for repairs, and now Waterloo Region's light rail vehicles are getting a close look.
"The Region of Waterloo is aware that some of the TTC's streetcars require corrective work," TJ Flynn, regional manager of Ion community relations, said Wednesday in an email.
"At this point, Bombardier is examining the region's light rail vehicles to determine if a similar issue is present on our vehicles."
Flynn did not know when the region would find out if its Ion vehicles would also need repairs due to welding problems.
"We remain focused on ensuring that service will begin in December 2018, and on providing a quality and safe service to our passengers in Waterloo Region."
The Toronto Star reported Wednesday that an investigation by Bombardier found the first 67 of the 89 cars it supplied to the Toronto Transit Commission had a welding defect that needed to be fixed or they could fail prematurely.
The repairs are expected to take until at least 2022, and the recall is only the latest problem to affect the repeatedly delayed vehicle purchase.
Waterloo Region has also been hit by delays due to repeated production issues at Bombardier.
The service was initially expected to start in July 2017. That was pushed back several times and now the launch date is expected for December.
The region announced late last year that the project's construction cost was up by $50 million — almost half of that increase related to vehicle delays. The province kicked in another $25 million and the region will try to recover the remaining from Bombardier.
CINCINNATI: With sidelined Serena Williams about to have a baby, five players have a chance to grab the world number one ranking at this week's US Open tuneup event in Cincinnati.
Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who announced their pregnancy and the end of their season in April, owned the top spot for 186 consecutive weeks through last September, matching Steffi Graf for an Open Era record, and traded the spot with Germany's Angelique Kerber earlier this year.
Defending Cincinnati champion Karolina Pliskova took over the top spot five weeks ago but will lose points from their title run, opening the door for rivals to overtake them
Romania's second-ranked Simona Halep, world number three Kerber, Ukraine's fourth-rated Elina Svitolina and fifth-ranked Dane Caroline Wozniacki could claim the top spot.

"Nothing has changed. I have a big responsibility. I'll do everything as I have before," Pliskova said. "I do think it's a huge thing but I don't want to do anything just because of the rankings.

"I don't try to behave differently. I try not to see the pressure."
Pliskova has won titles this year at Brisbane, Doha and Eastbourne but anything short of a repeat gives Halep a chance to reach number one by winning the title.
"To be number one in the world is a big thing. It shows you have been consistent. You have won the place. If I deserve the place, for sure I will win it," Halep said.
The Romanian however remains haunted by a French Open finals loss to Jelena Ostapenko in which they were up a set and a break before squandering a chance at their first Grand Slam title and number one.
"I still have bad dreams about that," Halep said. "I still suffer."
She's also trying to forget a 6-1, 6-1 loss to Svitolina in the Toronto semi-finals, one for which they apologized to spectators on Monday.
"I was really disappointed. It was a horror match for me," Halep said. "I couldn't feel the ball. I can't say I wasn't ready to play. It never happened to me before, not like that."
Svitolina, 22, has won titles this year in Taiwan, Dubai, Istanbul, Rome and Toronto.
They credit Dubai with inspiration but improved in their Canada title run last week.
"The title in Dubai really gave me that push. I played great," Svitolina said. "But this tournament in Toronto showed me I can go there not playing my best and fight back and still be able to win the title.
"It's one more step in a good direction."
'IT'S GOING TO BE A BATTLE'
Svitolina's hot season has inspired them to aim big.
"It's very special. It gives me more energy to go for more," Svitolina said.
They need a title and Pliskova out before the semi-finals to reach number one.
"I know this but I try not to put so much pressure on myself. Of course to be number one is a goal of mine. The important thing is to play well," Svitolina said.
"I know it's very close for everyone. I'd prefer to play well at big tournaments. Then the ranking will be there."
Kerber and Wozniacki need Pliskova to crash out in their opening match to have a chance at number one this week.
And while Spain's sixth-ranked Garbine Muguruza, can't overtake now, they would be a threat to do so at the US Open.
"It's going to be a battle," they said. "I like that I'm part of it and it's going to be a big thing. Now I feel like I've got to play. I can't miss a tournament. If I do I'm gone."

Iggy Azalea's fancy tastes may be out of their budget.
The rapper is being sued by American Express for $299,147.81 in unpaid credit card bills, according to legal documents obtained by E!
News.
AMEX is seeking the full amount — which is $250,000 over their credit limit — plus legal fees.
It's just the latest financial drama for the 27-year-old Aussie emcee.
Azalea was slapped with two tax liens in 2016: $269,980.20 for unpaid 2015 taxes and $391,056.55 for 2014, the year their debut album, “The New Classic,” dropped.
Azalea's net worth was estimated at $10 million in 2016, but it's unclear where that figure stands now. They spend $15,000 on rent every month apartment, and their sophomore album, “Digital Distortion,” was shelved indefinitely, though they assured fans it would come out eventually.
A rep for Azalea didn't immediately return a request for comment.
News of the rapper's credit woes was first reported by The Blast.

BERLIN: The German Defence Ministry said on Monday that the European fighter jet was in poll position to replace its Tornado jets, which it wants to phase out starting in 2025.
It added in a statement that Boeing's F-15 and F-18 fighters, as well as Lockheed Martin's F-35 aircraft, were secondary options. No final decision has been made.
The Eurofighter Typhoon is a joint project between British defence group BAE, France's Airbus and Italy's Finmeccanica.
France and Germany said earlier this year they plan to develop an European fighter jet as they seek to tighten defence and security cooperation.

Aug 11, 2017; Charlotte, NC, USA; Hideki Matsuyama reacts to their shot on the 16th tee during the second round of the 2017 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club. Mandatory Credit: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY Sports/Files
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Hideki Matsuyama has broad shoulders but is not finding it easy to carry the weight of an entire nation as they seek to become the first Japanese man to win a major.
Matsuyama started the third round of the PGA Championship tied for the lead with Kevin Kisner but never got into gear, a bogey at the first setting the table for a pedestrian one-over-par 72.
That was still good enough to remain in contention, a stroke behind Kisner, who dropped three shots in the final three holes.
"Probably the pressure had something to do with it, being in the last group in a major tournament," said Matsuyama.
"But I haven't been spot-on all week, and the worries I had about my swing showed up today in the way I played.
"I'm disappointed the way I played today, however I'm happy to be one stroke back and still have a chance and looking forward to tomorrow."
Matsuyama is coming off a closing 61 that clinched a runaway victory at last week's WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. They said at the time they had shot the stunning score despite being uncomfortable with their swing, words they repeated pre-tournament here.
Despite their struggles, the 25-year-old played the difficult final three holes better than their rivals, parring them all to finish the day much closer than they expected an hour previously.
The promise of monster dividends stretching long into the future makes Vodafone Group (LSE: VOD) a brilliant pick for your ISA before the upcoming investment deadline.

The promise of monster dividends stretching long into the future makes Vodafone Group (LSE: VOD) a brilliant pick for your ISA before the upcoming investment deadline.
City analysts are expecting the telecoms master to shell out a 15 euro cents per share dividend in the year to March 2018, up from 14.77 cents last year and helped by a 25% earnings rise. As a consequence, share pickers can lap up a gigantic 6.5% yield.
And the good news carries on. In fiscal 2019, for which a 10% profits advance is forecast, Vodafone is predicted to pay a 15.2 cent reward. This pushes the yield to an even better 6.6%.
Some investors may still baulk at the Footsie play's giant forward P/E ratio of 22.7 times. But look a little closer and the business could actually be considered decent value relative to its predicted growth trajectory, Vodafone rocking up with a sub-1 PEG multiple of 0.9.
The FTSE 100 is in great shape to keep reporting strong profits growth beyond the medium term too. Regulatory issues and problems surrounding phone sales in the UK have hampered performance in Europe more recently. But with the business having invested shedloads on improving its network in recent years, it is well placed to cotton on to improving economic conditions here.
Meanwhile, Vodafone is also continuing to reap the fruits of surging mobile demand in emerging markets as personal affluence levels grow. Indeed, during October-December, organic service revenues from the Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific (AMAP) region jumped 6.8%, up from 6.2% in the prior quarter.
I am confident its strong profits outlook and formidable cash flows should keep dividends growing at a steady rate.
Diversified demon
Another hot last-minute pick for ISA investors is Bunzl (LSE: BNZL). The support services play may not pack the sort of inflation-mashing dividends of those over at Vodafone. But for those seeking dependable payout growth year after year it is impossible to knock it. After all, Bunzl has raised dividends for the last 25 consecutive years.
The company has its fingers in many pies. It supplies a wide range of services spanning many industries, giving it exceptional profits protection should weakness occur in one or two segments.
What's more, Bunzl also carries splendid geographical diversification which gives earnings visibility that extra little boost, an essential characteristic of course for those seeking reliable dividend increases. And its aggressive approach to M&A (it spent a record £616m on acquisitions last year alone) is constantly building the foundations for sterling shareholder returns in the future.
Earnings at Bunzl are expected to spin 4% higher in both 2018 and 2019, providing a sound base for more dividend expansion.
Last year's 46p per share payout is predicted to edge to 49.2p in the current period and again to 51.8p in 2019. The resultant yields stand at 2.4% and 2.5%. Again, these may not be the biggest on the market but they are pretty well covered by anticipated earnings, at 2.5 times through to the close of next year.
At current prices Bunzl changes hands on a forward P/E multiple of 16.5 times. That is far too cheap for a share with as stunning a growth and dividend record as this, in my opinion.

India's National Security Strategy was launched in the form of India Armed Forces Joint Doctrine. This particular doctrine substantiates that India has evolved and moved from credible minimum deterrence to credible deterrence. Furthermore, the doctrine explicates that there is no restriction in development of their nuclear assets which means Indians would develop their armed forces horizontally as well as vertically. Moreover, the joint doctrine explains that Pakistan and China are direct military threat to the India's hegemonic posture. India may soon change this role in the global arms industry by transforming itself into a leading weapon exporting nation as the country has shifted its focus towards indigenous defense production. In addition to that, the document also reiterates that surgical strikes will become a formal retaliatory toolkit against terror provocations especially against Pakistan.
Since India has aspirations to become a regional power, its doctrine provides an impression and reflection of Unites States National Security Strategy. Most of the component in India's doctrine are taken from US security strategy. India is trying to harm Pakistan through kinetic and non-kinetic means, and the Government of Pakistan needs to stop its internal squabbles and focus on developing the country's national strength by virtue of strong and resilient armed forces, robust defense production infrastructure, and by developing an indigenous scientific research and development culture. Also, there is a need of greater debate in Pakistan on the introduction of tactical nuclear weapons for counterforce, targeting to offset India's conventional forces and it's Cold Start Doctrine (CSD). Additionally, Pakistan also needs to build its tri-services capability, in order to bridge the existing asymmetry between India and Pakistan by strengthening latter's nuclear as well as conventional deterrence.
Pakistan government, policy makes, military and political leaders and strategist must also be aware of the fact that this doctrine is not only limited to physical encounters, rather the doctrine also comprises elements of Hybrid Warfare. Pakistan needs to cater to these facets holistically rather than see them in isolation for its own national interests and national security. Regardless of what India did, Pakistan needs to put all its efforts in strengthening its economy and governance mechanisms as without these prerequisites, it would face insurmountable challenges in the future. One important factor is that Pakistan's national narrative must not be compromised at any level. With recent example of our political leader, defying the national narrative and security, defaming Pakistan's image in the international arena by claiming Pakistan's role in Mumbai attacks will assist India to pursue its mission of maligning Pakistan as a state that sponsors terrorism.
India has committed about 1394 ceasefire violations along the LoC in 2017, while from the beginning of 2018 till now, the Indian forces have carried out more than a 1000 ceasefire violations which clearly indicates the upsurge of Indian military aggression. International organizations, especially the United Nations must take notice of continuous Indian belligerence. Pakistan strongly believes that continued, comprehensive and result-oriented engagement between the two countries is important for peace and prosperity of the region and beyond, however if necessary, Pakistan is fully capable of giving a befitting response to any misadventure.

Trello, the popular card-based project management service owned by Atlassian, is getting a bit of a revamp today.
Traditionally, Trello was always about its cards and boards — and nothing else. But that also meant that power users often had to wade through a number of boards to figure out what they should focus on next. Now, Trello is getting a personalized newsfeed that will highlight activity from your Trello teams.
“By displaying a newsfeed of activity from your Trello teams, home surfaces the information you need, when you need it,” the Trello team writes today. “Let the information come to you and browse at your own pace. See what everyone on your team is working on without having to dig through every individual board.”

Novak Djokovic has undergone an elbow operation in an attempt to cure an injury that has troubled them for the past two years.
BELGRADE: Novak Djokovic has undergone an elbow operation in an attempt to cure an injury that has troubled them for the past two years.
The 30-year-old Serb said they had agreed to surgery after last month's Australian Open when they were treated on court in losing to unseeded South Korean Chung Hyeon in the last 16.
"I agreed with my team that I would try different methods after I finish in Australia and a few days ago I accepted to do a small medical intervention on my elbow. It seems like I am on the good road now to full recovery," they posted on Instagram.
The 12-time grand slam champion had hoped the extended break they took last year might solve the problem but said they decided on more drastic action after still experiencing pain in Melbourne.
"I've been carrying this injury for the past two years, and during this time I've been seeing many doctors," said Djokovic, who before last month had not competed since losing at Wimbledon last year.
"I took six months off last season hoping to come back fully recovered, but unfortunately I still felt pain," they said.

"It's quite a journey this one, I have to say. I'm learning a lot and for that I'm grateful. I've always taken care of my body and looked for the most natural ways to heal, and my body has rewarded me with some incredible years on tour.
"I am super positive and excited to follow my recovery through so I can come back to the place I love the most. The court."
Serbia's former Davis Cup coach Bogdan Obradovic predicted Djokovic would make a full recovery.
"I am convinced that Djokovic can return stronger, they have overcome many problems in their career," said Obradovic, who led Serbia to their maiden title in the competition in 2010.
"He has made all the right moves - they took a break in an effort to avoid surgery, played at the Australian Open and when it didn't work, having the surgery was the only option.
"He is still hungry for success and what they need to do now is be patient," they told Reuters.
Djokovic's rival, Britain's Andy Murray, is also recovering from surgery, to their hip, after also finding that rest did not cure their long-term injury.

Fugitive film director Roman Polanski has urged a judge to listen to their sex attack victim and drop the 40-year case against him.
Polsanski's lawyer Harland Braun has filed legal papers saying the Oscar-winning director believes the judge should respect the "wishes" of Samantha Geimer, who was 13 when they said Polanski plied them with champagne and a sedative during the assault.
Monday's filing comes after Ms Geimer, now 54, made their first personal plea to Los Angeles Superior Court for the case to be dropped as an "act of mercy" to them
Polanski, now 83, went on the run, having admitted a lesser charge of having unlawful sex with the girl during a photoshoot at Jack Nicholson's Hollywood Hills home in 1977.
Mr Braun said in the document: "Mr Polanski believes the court should respect the wishes of Ms Geimer as they stated in court.
"Mr Polanski hopes the court will understand why they are very sceptical that they will be treated fairly and hopes this court will prove them incorrect."
The filing intends to add pressure to Judge Scott Gordon, who is writing a response to Ms Geimer's motion to dismiss the case on Friday.
Ms Geimer, who reportedly received a payout of more than half a million dollars in 1993 after they sued Polanski, said they believe they have served their time after spending 42 days in jail.
They told the court: "I would implore you to consider taking action to finally put this issue to close as an act of mercy to myself and my family.
"A 40-year sentence has been imposed on the victim of the crime as well as the perpetrator."
Deputy district attorney Michele Hanisee made the case that their suffering had been extended because of Polanski's refusal to attend the court for sentencing.
Polanski, who won the best director Oscar for The Pianist, fled in 1978, fearing that a judge would extend their sentence.
Nicholson was not at home at the time of the offence and prosecutors dropped charges of rape and sodomy against Polanski, who is currently free to travel France, Switzerland and Poland.
The Daesh terrorist group on Wednesday claimed one of its militants killed two police officers and a student in the Belgian city of Liege this week, the Amaq propaganda agency linked to the group said.
"The author of the attack on the city of Liege in Belgium is a soldier," the group said in a statement published on Amaq's Telegram account a day after the attack, referring to the terrorist as a "soldier."
The attacker, who was later killed by police, was an inmate who had been granted a few hours release Monday but failed to return to prison, officials said. It wasn't immediately clear why they were imprisoned, but media reports say that he's a known drug offender.
Liege prosecutors' spokesperson Philippe Dulieu said the man approached two police officers from behind carrying a knife and stabbed them several times.
"He then took their weapons. They used the weapons on the officers, who died," Dulieu told reporters.
Dulieu said the attacker then shot dead a 22-year-old man in a vehicle that was just leaving a parking place outside a nearby high school. The attacker than took a woman hostage inside the school.
"Liege police intervened. They came out firing at police, wounding a number of them, notably in the legs. They were shot dead," the spokesperson said.
Belgian police and military have been on alert since suicide bombers killed 32 people at the Brussels airport and subway system in 2016.
It's not the first time Liege has been hit by a similarly violent attack. In December 2011, a man with a history of weapons and drug offenses left home with hand grenades and guns before they lobbed the grenades into a square filled with Christmas shoppers and fired on those who escaped. Five were killed, including the assailant.
KATHMANDU: At least 165 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal, India and Bangladesh, officials said on Monday (Aug 14), warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear.
Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 70 people in Nepal, 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh.
Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains.
Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels.
Huge swathes of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal, with the two countries trading blame for the disaster.
In Nepal, police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods.

As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the country's home ministry said another 47 people were missing, presumed dead.
The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country.
"In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards," spokesperson Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP.
"Several villages and settlements are unreachable. Telecommunications, mobile phones are still not working so it is difficult to give a full assessment."
In India, emergency workers were scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two passenger buses into a deep gorge on Sunday, killing at least 46 people in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh.
In the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand - which also borders Nepal - three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains, local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP.
BANGLADESH DEPLOY TROOPS
Bangladesh deployed troops to shore up embankments in the north of the country, where flooding has killed 22 people.
Local government administrator Kazi Hasan Ahmed told AFP up to 700,000 people had been marooned by flood waters after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain.
"We've not seen such severe floods in Dinajpur since 1988," they said, referring to the worst-hit district.
"The town protection embankment was washed away by flood water, submerging most of the main town."
The government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre warned that water levels in some major rivers would continue to rise over the next 72 hours, raising fears the flooding could spread.
In Nepal, the worst of the flooding was in the southern lowlands known as the Terai, the country's most fertile region and home to much of its agriculture.
"We are getting reports that about 70 percent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated," said Shankar Sapkota, senior agricultural economist with the government.
"Paddy fields, vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we cannot confirm the extent of damage."
Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June.
The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from the area expected to be hit.
Hundreds have died in torrential rain, floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon, which hits the country's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation, lasting into September.
The white supremacist riots in Charlottesville, Va. have given new life to a very old video: an anti-Nazi film released by the U.S. War Department just after the Second World War.
The video, titled “Don't Be a Sucker,” was produced in 1947. But something about its anti-fascist message evidently spoke to people watching the rallies and violence in Virginia this weekend.

On Saturday, hundreds of members of the neo-Confederate League of the South, neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement and white nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party showed up to protest, along with several high-profile white nationalist figures.
The rally turned violent and one woman, Heather Heyer, was killed when a driver rammed a car into a crowd of counter-protesters.
Many people online were alarmed by the sight of people carrying Nazi flags and their white supremacist messages. And that's when this video was re-discovered and went viral.
A B.C. man's tweet, including a short clip from the video, was shared over 137,000 times.

The 17-minute film discusses Nazi messages and their populist appeal and describes how Americans must be vigilant against such hateful speech.
The film, which can be viewed in its entirety at the Internet Archive, opens with a scene of a man falling for a gambling scheme, equating this with people who fall for Nazi-style rhetoric.

In a particularly poignant scene, a character named Mike attends a rally at which a fiery speaker rails against immigrants and black people who take jobs meant for “real Americans.” Mike believes in what the speaker is saying, until they name Freemasons as an enemy group – as Mike is a Freemason himself.
Mike also meets a Hungarian immigrant who tells them that he's heard this kind of speech before.
“In this country, we have no ‘other people,'” says the immigrant. “We are American people, all of us.” They then tells the tale of what they saw happen in Germany, which became a “nation of suckers” under the Nazi Party. Only the leaders ultimately benefited from the changed German society, they said.
WATCH: Peter Cvjetanovic, the 20-year-old photographed screaming at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, VA told CBS news that they were marching against what they call the “slow replacement of white heritage.”
A stalled appointment process; a botched attempt at installing a member of the Liberal family in a post that requires total independence from the government; a unilateral bid to change the rules of the House of Commons . . . if Stephen Harper, and not Justin Trudeau, were running things on Parliament Hill, they would stand accused of institutional malevolence.Exhibit A: Almost halfway through their mandate, Trudeau has yet to fill a single parliamentary watchdog vacancy. Most of the positions of agents of Parliament are currently held by interim appointees or by commissioners whose terms have been extended. Some, such as the ethics and the information commissioners, are on their second or third extensions.A full year after chief electoral officer Marc Mayrand gave their notice, the government has not yet come up with a permanent replacement. Under Harper, a prime minister whose relationship with Elections Canada was far from cordial, the transition took place over a matter of days. The job of running Canada's ever-evolving election system had traditionally been considered a sensitive one that requires a steady hand at the helm.Judicial appointments have been proceeding at a glacial pace. And with every passing week, more crown corporations are operating under skeleton boards. As of next week, for instance, the CBC/Radio-Canada board will be down to half its 12-member roster, leaving it with the bare minimum required to meet a quorum. A spokesperson for heritage minister Mélanie Joly told Le Devoir last week that a selection process would “soon” be in place!Connect all these dots and the result is an across-the-board weakening of federal and parliamentary oversight functions. By necessity day-to-day management is becoming a substitute for strategic planning.Article Continued BelowExhibit B: Trudeau justifies the unprecedented delays in the appointment chain by the quest for a merit-based system.But, if the Prime Minister thought the Harper-appointed agents of Parliament, whose terms they have extended, were chosen on a basis other than competence, would they not have been in a hurry to replace them?Trudeau's own first (failed) attempt at appointing a parliamentary watchdog — the nomination of former Ontario Liberal minister Madeleine Meilleur for official languages commissioner — did not pass the non-partisan smell test.
They had a good run, especially considering their slightly dubious beginnings. The pop group Fifth Harmony came into being in 2012, when the hosts of the reality singing competition show The X-Factor put five unrelated contestants together into a group. It's the same trick that the British version of the show had pulled off earlier with One Direction, and it worked nearly as well. Fifth Harmony became maybe the biggest American girl group since Destiny's Child, and their “Work From Home” has emerged as a sort of late-period pop classic, a song that never leaves rotation. But now, after six years, the members of the group are going their separate ways.
This was inevitable. Singing groups simply do not survive the departures of their most famous members, and that happened with Fifth Harmony at the end of 2016, when Camila Cabello left the group under contentious circumstances. Cabello has gone onto become even more successful as a solo artist. Meanwhile, the remaining members of Fifth Harmony had a go of it without Cabello, releasing their self-titled third album last year and memorably dissing Cabello onstage at the VMAs. But this morning, they announced their hiatus on Twitter.
In their statement on Twitter, the members of Fifth Harmony write, “After six years of going hard, non stop, we realized that in order to stay authentic to ourselves and you, we do need to take some time for now to go on a hiatus from Fifth Harmony in order to pursue solo endeavors.” They also say that they're playing the shows that they've currently got planned. Here's the tweet:

The feds don't want an ankle bracelet taken off of “Smallville” actor Allison Mack when they travel from California to New York to face sex trafficking and forced labor conspiracy charges, according to new court documents.
Mack – the alleged sidekick of accused NXIVM leader Keith Raniere – has been on house arrest at their parents' home in Los Alamitos, Calif., on a $5 million bond since their arrest last month for their alleged involvement in a sex cult.
The California federal court system would normally remove a defendant's GPS ankle bracelet for air travel, prosecutors wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Brooklyn federal judge Nicholas Garaufis.
But Brooklyn prosecutor Moira Penza balked.
“In light of the foregoing, the government respectfully requests that the Court order that Ms. Mack is to remain on continuous electronic monitoring while on pretrial release, including when traveling by air,” Penza wrote.
Mack's lawyers don't oppose the request, the court papers say.
Criminal defendants are permitted to travel on airplanes with the GPS ankle bracelets, according to a source.
Raniere and Mack, 35, allegedly blackmailed women into becoming sex slaves.
The victims were allegedly brainwashed, starved and even branded with Raniere's initials.
Raniere, 57, is in federal custody pending the pair's Oct. 1 trial.
Turkish weightlifting legend Naim Süleymanoğlu's remains were exhumed on Wednesday for a paternity lawsuit filed by Süleymanoğlu's alleged daughter Sekai Mori.
Mori alleges that Süleymanoğlu met with their mother Kyoko Mori, a Japanese journalist, at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. According to Mori, the couple got close and the rest is history. They requested a paternity test through their lawyer and Turkish officials decided to exhume the remains of Süleymanoğlu in order to obtain tissue samples for DNA tests.
Naim Süleymanoğlu died at age 50 in November 2017 after they were admitted to an Istanbul hospital due to liver failure caused by cirrhosis.
Süleymanoğlu's daughters, Esin and Sezin Süleymanoğlu had previously issued a statement through their lawyer Aziz Demir who had said "We don't want the exhumation. The dear departed will turn in their grave. If there was something like that, they would have had the DNA tests done themselves when they were in good health. Their daughters are very sad, they are devastated."
Demir was at the cemetery during the exhumation and told reporters that the action was "a violation of Süleymanoğlu's dignity."
"It is very sad," Demir said, describing the lawsuit as a financially motivated act to grab a piece of inheritance left by the late weightlifter.
Sekai Mori's lawyers were also present at the cemetery. Hülya Aksakal did not speak much but said their client would comment on the issue themselves "based on the outcome of lawsuit."

The athlete, nicknamed "Pocket Hercules" due to their short stature, became a global star after setting six world records, winning three Olympic gold medals and out lifting the winner of the weight class above them at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.
After winning the world championship in 1988, they retired at the age of 22. However, they returned in 1991 to win a second Olympic gold at Barcelona in 1992.
They built up one of the sport's greatest ever rivalries with Greece's Valerios Leonidis which was followed avidly by Turkish and Greek communities across the world. Trading world records with Valerios Leonidis, Süleymanoğlu eventually won their third Olympic gold medal.
In 2000 and 2004 they were elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame. They were awarded the Olympic Order, the highest award of the Olympic movement, in 2001.
Süleymanoğlu is the only weightlifter in history to win gold medals in three different Olympics.
In a shocking announcement, Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday called for an early general election to be held June 8 to seek a strong mandate as they negotiate Britain's exit from the European Union.
Standing outside 10 Downing Street, May said they would ask the House of Commons on Wednesday to back their call for an election, three years before the next scheduled date in May 2020.
They said that since Britons voted to leave the E.U. in June, the country had come together, but politicians had not. They said the political divisions "risk our ability to make a success of Brexit."
At present, May's governing Conservatives have 330 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. May said that "our opponents believe that because the government's majority is so small, our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course" on leaving the E.U.
"They are wrong," they said. "They underestimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country."
Under Britain's Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, elections are held every five years, but the prime minister can call a snap election if two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it.
The leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has previously said they would back such a call.
May took office in July after predecessor David Cameron stepped down following their failed attempt to get voters to back remaining in the E.U. Since then they have ruled out calling an early election to get their own mandate. But they said Tuesday they had "reluctantly" changed their mind.
Polls give May's Conservatives a double-digit lead on Labour, which is divided under left-wing leader Corbyn.
The pound rose 0.1% against the U.S. dollar after the announcement, to 1.257, recovering from a 0.4% drop an hour earlier.

After back-to-back lackluster seasons where the Florida Panthers missed the postseason, 2016 seems like forever ago, when the Panthers took on the New York Islanders in the first round. After a stellar 2015-16 season, the Panthers had home-ice advantage in the playoffs, which led many to believe that the team would dominate for years to come. While they have yet to see it through, perhaps next season is their year.
Panthers' Youth Ready to Carry the Load
The most significant difference for the 2018-19 outlook is the step forward that Florida's best players made this season. While the development of Aleksander Barkov, Jonathan Huberdeau and Vincent Trocheck has been a common theme throughout the last few summers, unlike other years, the wait for the trio to become legitimate threats is over.
Injuries are bound to happen at times, but as long as all three forwards can stay relatively healthy, then the sky is the limit for the Panthers. The potential of Florida's talented forwards has never been in question, but this season we finally saw the reason for the hype. Despite missing the playoffs, all three had career-high statistics, and there is no reason to think they would not continue to improve.
Perhaps even better is that all three are just entering their prime. Their best days are still ahead, but each has blossomed into a top-tier NHL talent already. Barkov and Trocheck, in particular, make up one of the best center duos in the NHL. They play a well-rounded game and are responsible at both ends of the ice — as we saw this season, they are difference-makers.
Comparing the 2015-16 Panthers to Next Season's
When comparing the Panthers' 2015-16 roster to next season's, there are reasons to believe 2018-19 could be the organization's best year. Following the 2015-16 season, in which Florida finished tied for fifth in the NHL with 103 points, their leading scorers were Jaromir Jagr (66 points), Jussi Jokinen (60), Barkov (59), Huberdeau (59) and Trocheck (53).
Heading into 2018-19, the top five scorers are Barkov (78 points), Trocheck (75), Huberdeau (69), Evgenii Dadonov (65) and Keith Yandle (56). Florida's fourth-best scorer from this season would have ranked second on the team that finished fifth in 2015-16. Their fifth-leading scorer, Yandle, would have been just four points out of second. Scoring that season was down compared to this season, but nonetheless, this season's roster was more talented than in years past.
Consistency Is Difficult for Older Players
Perhaps part of the reason the 2016-17 season was so forgettable was the expectations placed on veterans such as Jagr and Jokinen — specifically Jagr, who was impressive the season before. What wasn't considered was that a veteran's year-to-year production can vary greatly. Age matters in professional sports, and it is unreasonable to assume that players in their twilight years can repeat stellar seasons. Most wouldn't have been surprised if both Jagr and Jokinen produced 60 points in 2016-17, but that was not how it played out.
Instead, the older guys had a difficult time maintaining a high level of play, and former head coach Gerard Gallant took the fall for it. When Gallant was relieved of their duties it seemed as if the organization was grasping at straws. Rather than simply recognizing their older players were declining, and their younger players were not yet ready for the next step, they fired a coach who had brought them to the playoffs the season before. The difference between then and now is that this time, their best players and top-point producers are rising rather than falling.
Younger Generation Pivotal
Now that their forwards are consistent producers, defensemen Aaron Ekblad and Mike Matheson are fully developed professionals, and top prospects Henrik Borgstrom and Owen Tippett are poised for full-time roles in the NHL next season. This could be the step forward Florida fans have been waiting for. Borgstrom, specifically, has the tools to be a force in the league.
While they may not hit Matthew Barzal-like rookie numbers, if given the opportunity, they could be a difference-maker for the club. For the Panthers to live up to the hype, after finishing 30-10-1 in the second half of the season, it's players like Borgstrom that will need to put them over the edge.
Expectations Are High Once Again
Each of the past three summers, the Panthers seemed like a team ready to become a force in the NHL. Their talent level, combined with cap room to sign free agents, will once again make them a team in the spotlight going into next season. If they fall flat, then this may be the end of the hype. After all, a team that comes up short year after year only deserves so much patience.
About 500 people from Edmonton's vulnerable inner-city community filled their stomachs at a huge holiday meal served at the Hope Mission on Easter Monday.
About 50 volunteers made sure people who may not have a home still got to enjoy turkey, stuffing and other holiday favourites. The evening featured musical performances as well.
“This can be a really lonely season,” said Robin Padanyi, who works for the Christian not-for-profit organization. “A lot of guests coming to us are experiencing tremendous hurt and for us to come alongside them and to show them they are loved and we value them and to give the hope of Easter to those who are maybe in a season of hopelessness is really what this Easter meal at Hope Mission is all about.”

Diners were waited on by volunteers staff and volunteers transformed the facility to create an Easter atmosphere by hanging decorations.
“We are extremely grateful for the generosity of those who give of their time and resources to make this event happen, and are so excited to celebrate the joy of Easter with our friends in this exceptional way,” The Hope Mission said in a statement.

The Hope Mission began in Alberta's capital in 1929 when Rev. Harold Edwardson established a soup kitchen in the inner-city to serve meals to hundreds of people struggling with unemployment and homelessness.
The organization says it currently serves over 1,000 meals a day and provides shelter for about 500 people. It also operates a 24/7 “rescue van” to provide emergency care for people in need.

The unprecedented alliance between the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) may reportedly expand with other parties joining what has been termed as the "national agreement," as the two parties seek to increase their chances in the local and general elections as well as the presidential elections in 2019.
As President and AK Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gathered 54 deputies at AK Party headquarters in Ankara on Thursday, they said the alliance with the MHP is not only because they want to reach 50 percent of the vote plus one. They reportedly said there are ongoing talks with other parties, as well.
"There might be others who see themselves in this agreement, not only the MHP. There are meetings with other parties as well. Therefore this agreement should be seen in a broader way," Erdoğan was quoted as saying in the meeting with fellow deputies, which was closed to the press.
The parties that the AK Party is currently meeting are reportedly the Great Union Party (BBP) and the Felicity Party (SP).
As for the controversial issue of whether or not to lower the national election threshold, Erdoğan told fellow deputies that the 10 percent threshold would be kept the same. There have been rumors that a new election threshold would be implemented for alliances, which is speculated to be around 12 or 15 percent. However, the president did not confirm it in the meeting, per the media.
Under the new system, the votes of alliances will be counted together, and a party that stays below the 10 percent election threshold will not be left out of Parliament. Therefore, the AK Party administration is not planning to make a move to lower the threshold. MHP Chairman Devlet Bahçeli was the first to bring the issue to the agenda. Sources close to the parties have said as of now, all options are being considered with regard to the threshold.
Justice Minister Abdülhamit Gül, Parliament constitution committee head Mustafa Şentop and AK Party spokesperson Mahir Ünal represented their party, while the MHP was represented by Deputy Secretary-General Mustafa Kalaycı, lawmaker Mehmet Parsak from Afyonkarahisar province, and another parliamentarian from Istanbul province, İsmail Faruk Aksu.
The joint committee has so far gathered three times to discuss all options regarding the alliance and adjustment law packages. The two parties are reportedly having differences of opinion on the issue of how parliamentary seats will be distributed among candidates. According to sources close to the AK Party, the parties may come up with a mutual strategy or the Supreme Election Board (YSK) can apply the current D'Hondt system.
One of the alternatives in regard to how seats will be distributed is that each party will have deputies in provinces according to their vote share.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets plunged and bond yields soared on Friday after U.S. data showing the strongest annual wage growth since 2009 rattled investors who fear accelerating inflation will usher in more interest rate hikes than expected this year.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note shot up to a four-year high just minutes after the release of a Labor Department unemployment report for January that underscored strong momentum in the U.S. economy.
A gain of 200,000 jobs last month and annualised increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent led the dollar to surge against the yen, the euro and a basket of six currencies.
The price of the U.S. 10-year note later fell further, pushing the yield up as high as 2.854 percent from 2.773 percent late on Thursday.
The rapid rise in the 10-year note - the world benchmark for corporate lending - sent shockwaves through a market grown accustomed to low inflation and a steady tick higher in stocks.
“It feels as though the grand era of interest rates below 3 percent will soon be in the rear-view mirror,” said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund in New York.
While wage growth may be good for the economy it could spell trouble for the bond market as inflation portends rate hikes, which augur a repricing of fixed income, they said.
The spike in bond rates made everybody nervous, said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. But the stock sell-off was long overdue, they said.
“The correction looks a whole lot worse than maybe it is because of the fact that we hadn't had a correction for so long that we all got used to watching this market go up,” they said.
Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said next week investors will kick themselves for selling assets for all the wrong reasons in a sell-off akin to throwing the baby out with the bath water.
“Next week we will start sorting and saying, ‘Wait a minute. We sold financials because interest rates are going higher?'”
It was the biggest single-day percentage decline for the benchmark S&P 500 index since September 2016 and for the Dow since June 2016. The S&P 500 is still up 3.2 percent for the year.
A stock slide of at least 1 percent in Europe later accelerated on Wall Street as the strong labour market data boosted chances the Federal Reserve will raise rates four times this year instead of the three hikes analysts had expected.
“What is good for the average American worker ends up being negative for stocks because it increases the odds of further rate hikes,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665.75 points, or 2.54 percent, to 25,520.96. The S&P 500 lost 59.85 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,762.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.92 points, or 1.96 percent, to 7,240.95.
Disappointing results from some of the largest U.S. companies also weighed on stocks. Oil majors Exxon and Chevron fell 5.1 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly profits.
Google-parent Alphabet fell 5.3 percent after an earnings miss and Apple fell 4.3 percent as investors focused on its muted forecast rather than strong iPhone prices.
MSCI's all-country world index of equity performance in 47 countries fell 1.8 percent while its gauge of emerging market stocks lost 1.43 percent.
Deutsche Bank's disappointing results pulled the heavyweight banking sector down to help European shares post their biggest weekly loss in more than a year, while Britain's top share index sealed its weakest week in nine months on BT's results.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 1.37 percent and the blue-chip FTSE 100 index in London closed down 0.63 percent.
The dollar index, tracking the unit against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.59 percent, with the euro down 0.38 percent to $1.2460. The Japanese yen weakened 0.64 percent versus the greenback at 110.12 per dollar.
The U.S. bond market's gauges of inflation expectations added to their rise. The gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and 10-year Treasury notes reached its widest since September 2014.
Crude prices fell on the surging dollar though adherence to output cuts by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and rising global demand kept much of this year's rally in oil in place.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down 35 cents to $65.45 a barrel. Brent lost $1.07 to $68.58. The deep decline in Brent cut the gap between it and WTI to its narrowest since August.
U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled down $10.60, or 0.8 percent, at $1,337.30.
Review: Logan Lucky
(M) Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, Daniel Craig
Steven Soderbergh (Oceans Eleven) has had an amazing career as a director and has delivered some of the most significant films of the past three decades. From Sex, Lies and Videotapes to their Academy Award winner of Erin Brockovich, they have proven to have skills and the pliability to change within an industry that has changed extensively over the years. One of the hallmarks of Soderbergh's directorial style is their ability to bring together an array of on-screen talent. From George Clooney to Julia Roberts to Channing Tatum, they have been able to draw some of the best performances out of this star-studded talent pool, which has benefited film history. When they announced their retirement in 2015, many asked why they would quit at the height of their career and how long this premature retirement would last? The second question was at least answered with the announcement that they would be releasing the latest heist comedy, Logan Lucky.
The film opens in the hills of West Virginia where the Logan family has had extreme ups and downs throughout their years in the Appalachians, which many in their community consider to be a family curse. Jimmy (Channing Tatum) is out to prove this blight on the family name wrong, even though they were recently let go from their construction job. Partnering with their siblings, Mellie (Riley Keough) and Clyde (Adam Driver), they put together a plan to steal millions of dollars from the Charlotte Motor Speedway during the much lauded NASCAR race, the Coca-Cola 600. With the assistance of a well-known felon, Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and their dim-witted brothers, the two hillbilly families work to steal the funds from the lucrative sporting facility. With their attempt to disprove the familial curse also meaning breaking Joe out of prison to do the job – really what could possibly go wrong?
For fans of Soderbergh's other heist films like the Oceans Eleven series and Out of Sight, the director chose to come back in a genre that is like visiting an old friend. Logan Lucky has all of the markers of their past brilliance, but with a fresh lot of characters and twists that will give audiences the satisfaction and familiarity they have come to enjoy throughout their career.
For the plot to be interpreted as sophisticated shows the abilities of the director and cast. From Seth McFarlane (Ted) to Dwight Yoakum (Slingblade) to Hillary Swank (Million Dollar Baby), regardless of the amount of screen time given to each character, they all show the value added to the final story. This is true of the lead actors, also. Tatum, Craig, Driver and Keough all provided the right combination of comedy and drama to make this caper film come to life. The highlights are found in the over the top antics of Daniel Craig as the incarcerated thief and Adam Driver as the put upon Logan. The former is given a character that shows the depth of their talent, which reaches beyond their James Bond persona. While Driver continues, to show the value of their understated demeanour and how it adds to the story.
It is an enjoyable and humorous joy ride through West Virginia and North Carolina. With Soderbergh's return after a short retirement, this is a welcomed inclusion into their cinematic canon and it makes a trip to the local theatre worthwhile.
Looking Deeper
Does the end justify the means? The age-old question of doing the right thing, but getting there by questionable methods. In recent films like John Wick: Chapter 2, Baby Driver and Logan Lucky, the lead character comes to a moral crossroads and must determine if questionable methods are worth considering achieving the preferred result.
The question of justification is a philosophical question that has continually plagued humankind, one that extends well beyond the few words found at the end of a film review. Yet, it is worth starting the conversation by saying the answer comes in the form of another question: ‘Who' determines your moral position?
If the answer is based in mere personal or societal standards, the rationale behind questionable methods could be easier to explain. These definitions can be rather fluid and could provide short-term peace of mind for an individual, but this answer never fully satisfies the question. For someone who considers themselves to be a follower of Jesus, what could be said is that the standard is set by someone else. This makes things somewhat easier, but also difficult at the same time. In this scenario, if the means of achieving a goal puts that person in the place of going against God's standard, then there is no justification.
It is a discussion that may seem pretty deep for a comedy/heist film review, but it is one worth contemplating. A good place to start could be by looking into the very words of this person, Jesus. The book of Mark is a great place to start.

SINGAPORE: A couple who got into an ugly spat with an elderly man at a hawker centre in Toa Payoh was charged in court on Thursday (Jun 15).
Chow Chuin Yee, 46, and Tay Puay Leng, 39, were arrested in April, after the police said they received reports about a couple who allegedly used offensive language and force against a 76-year-old man at a hawker centre on Toa Payoh Lorong 8.
Video circulating widely on social media showed them arguing with the elderly man over the use of a table which Tay allegedly reserved, and Chow is seen shoving the elderly man from behind, nearly knocking them over.
Chow was charged on Thursday with using criminal force against the elderly man. They were also charged with behaving in a disorderly manner for pushing bowls and plates off the table at the hawker centre.
Tay was charged with using abusive words with intent to cause alarm.

If convicted of using abusive words, Tay could be jailed up to six months and fined up to S$5,000.
General Motors CEO Mary Barra's decision to put the company's European operations on the block marks a turning point for the automaker that once prided itself on being the No. 1 vehicle maker in the world. If Barra succeeds in concluding a deal with French automaker Peugeot SA -- and people familiar with the discussions cautioned on Tuesday that many details are yet to be settled -- they will have delivered in an unexpected way on their promise to have GM “disrupt ourselves” rather than wait to be jolted by outside forces.

There are great reasons to believe in the positive power and impact of the Olympics. The international sporting competition encourages more children to play sports and has a positive impact by inspiring children to lead healthier lifestyles.
Playing sports encourages kids to get off their screens. It teaches many critical life skills they need to succeed as adults.
Sport also brings people together. In today's age of political conflict and division, I'm still optimistic that sports can transcend all: bridge our differences and get people to see all the things we share in common rather than the minority of differences separating us.
Hence why we should all be excited to see the return of the Winter Olympics next Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Canada is sending its strongest Olympic team ever. It is a mixture of veterans as well as young up and comers. There are currently 226 Team Canada athletes in total headed to the Olympic Winter Games to wear the maple leaf.
At the 2014 Sochi Winter Games, Canada fought extremely hard and finished fourth overall with 10 Gold medals and over 25 medals in total. In Vancouver 2010, on home soil, we finished with a record 14 Gold medals and a total medal count of 26.
Our Korea bound athletes are a mixture of experience and youth and we punch above our weight on the global winter sport stage. In 2018, with this group of athletes, Canada is projected to do well and will be in a tough fight to contend for first place overall atop the podium.
World Championships are a good barometer of future success at the Olympics. At various World Championships this year we have seen dozens and dozens of Canadian athletes who have finished with top podium results.
We have many athletes ranked in the top five in the world right now. And while there are sometimes dark horses who break through with a performance of their lives, the experts will tell you that to have a legitimate shot at winning an Olympic medal you need to be ranked in the top five in the world — heading into the games.
While most people focus on the actual winning of a medal at the games, the real story of the Olympics is the journey that got Canadian athletes to South Korea in the first place. It takes a lifetime of commitments and sacrifices for a few seconds of success – a mere moment in time.
This journey of the trials and tribulation of our athletes on the road to PyeongChang 2018 is being captured in a powerful way by Team Canada's new bold ‘BeOlympic.ca' campaign. It is another reason why we should support our athletes. They represent one of our Canadian values: The value of hard work and overcoming adversity to find success on the global stage.
Here are a few names to watch in the weeks to come:
Mikael Kingsbury – Quebec – Freestyle Skiing: They were just a 17-year-old spectator when Alex Bilodeau made history by winning the first ever Canadian gold medal on home soil at Vancouver 2010. Kingsbury won a silver in Sochi when Bilodeau won gold again. Now its Mikael's turn for gold.
Tessa Vurture and Scott Moir- Ontario – Figure Skating: Canada's flag bearers in 2018 won gold in 2010 and 2 silvers in Sochi – they are heavy favourites in ice dance to win gold.
Charles Hamelin – Quebec- Speed Skating, Short Track: Their 4th Olympic games and a 3-time gold medalist, they are one of Canada's most decorated male winter Olympians.
Mark McMorris – Saskatchewan – Snowboard: In 2014 they broke a rib and two weeks later won a bronze in Sochi. In February 2016 they broke their right femur and had an incredible comeback in 2017. Then in late March 2017 they had fractures to their jaw, left arm, pelvis and ribs as well as a ruptured spleen. Incredibly less than a year later they stand ready to win a medal for Canada in February 2018, a great comeback story for Canadians and overcoming adversity.
Dufur-Lapointe sisters – Quebec – Freestyle skiing: Sisters Chloe and Justine are competing against each other and could stand on the podium together just like in Sochi.
Women's hockey team: The most exciting moment for me in the Sochi games was the incredible comeback win for our women's hockey team to win gold. The defending goal medalists will have a dogfight on their hands against the World Champion team USA.
Kaillie Humphries – Alberta – Bobsleigh: Humphries goes into their third Olympics with two gold medals and goes for a three-peat. Humphriesand Heather Moyse were the first Canadian women to ever win gold in Bobsleigh at Vancouver 2010 and repeated in 2014.
Denny Morrison – British Columbia – Speed Skating – Long Track: Morrison nearly died from a motorcycle accident and then suffered a stroke while biking and was saved by their then-girlfriend Josie Spence, who diagnosed the problem. They return to the games with now-wife Josie Morrison who also qualified for the speed skating team.
Canadian athletes have made sacrifices to get to South Korea for the games. They have overcome adversity and some near-death experiences. And win, lose or draw, you know that the Canadian athletes will give their all on the field of play and will make us all proud. Let's wish every athlete and coach the best of luck and GO Canada GO!

MANALAPAN – Resembling an alumni homecoming weekend crowd more than a conference of academics, several hundred Monmouth County historians and authors recently gathered at the headquarters branch of the Monmouth County Library for Archives & History Day 2017. Old friends and colleagues from historical and genealogical societies, museum groups, libraries, and preservation committees mingled and greeted each other while visiting more than 60 exhibition tables.
This year's event, held Oct. 14, was the 22nd annual and celebrated “Inventors and Innovators in Monmouth County.” County Clerk Christine Giordano Hanlon opened the morning's Plenary Session welcoming the approximately 300 people. “This is our best crowd ever for our special day honoring Monmouth County history,” they said. “There is a lot of energy with new programs like the New Jersey RockNRoll Chorus and our photography contest for high school students, both of which brought new enthusiasm.”
Renee B. Swartz of the Monmouth County Library Commission followed Hanlon, acknowledging the debt all local historians owe to former County Clerk Jane Clayton who was responsible for the creation of the Monmouth County Archives.
All five of the serving Chosen Freeholders attended the gathering, including Director Lillian G. Burry, Deputy Director John P. Curley, Thomas A. Arnone, Serena DiMaso Esq., and Gary J. Rich Sr.
The high school students from New Jersey RockNRoll Chorus brought a fresh spirit to the gathering, performing their a cappella version of “Monmouth County.” The anthem was recently rediscovered by George Joynson, a resident of Holmdel and the reference specialist at the Monmouth County Archives. Written over 75 years ago by Cyril A. Smack of Sea Bright and their sister, Gertrude Smack Seaman, it was adopted as the official song of Monmouth County by the Board of Chosen Freeholders on July 5, 1939.
Gerry Scharfenberger received the M. Claire French Award for Leadership in Historic Preservation. Scharfenberger, the mayor of Middletown, was recognized for “Outstanding achievements (as) an elected official in supporting historic preservation in Monmouth County through education, development, planning, rehabilitation, advocacy, and community leadership.” Scharfenberger said they were pleasantly surprised by their award and by the turnout at the event, noting the mix of very young and older people from all over the county. They drew laughs when they noted: “As a professional archaeologist, usually most of my clients are dead.”
Archives & History Day host Gary Saretzky, who is the Monmouth County archivist, presented the Jane Clayton Award to John Belding, the Union Landing (Brielle) historian. “To me, obviously, it's a very exciting day. I am vitally interested in history, always have been since my days as a history major,” said Belding during their acceptance speech. They also reiterated what many in the audience consider gospel: “It's most important that we have an appreciation for what we've been and who's been there before us and what they did.”
The Two River area was well represented by organizations such as the Friends of the Monmouth County Library, the Historical Society of Highlands, the Keansburg Historical Society, the Parker Homestead, the Red Bank Public Library, the Shrewsbury Historical Society, the T. Thomas Fortune Foundation and the Tinton Falls Historic Preservation Commission.
Other recognitions went to Colts Neck's Emily McNeill, a sophomore at Communications High School in Wall. They won the first place in the Monmouth County photography contest with their dramatic sunset image of the Sandy Hook Lighthouse. The Monmouth County Genealogy Society's Barbara Carver Smith Award was presented to Beverly Yackel, Middletown, for their years teaching genealogy classes and editing the society's newsletter, The Monmouth Connection. The Innovative Archives Award was given to the Morristown National Historic Park Library and Museum.
Attendees at Archives & History Day received a 120-page book, “New Jersey in Focus: Inventors and Innovators in Monmouth County.” The full-color publication showcases biographies and contributions of dozens of Monmouth County inventors. It is produced every year by the Monmouth County Archives, a division of the County Clerk's office.
During the lunch break, Monmouth County Historian Randall Gabrielan led a forum entitled “A Discussion of Inventors and Innovators in New Jersey.”
The afternoon session concluded Archives & History Day with a presentation by featured speaker, Paul Israel, a Rutgers University professor and editor of the Thomas Edison Papers. Israel spoke about “New Jersey: A State of Innovation.” Their remarks and slide presentation noted that New Jersey was long considered “the Research State” primarily due to its leadership in three industries: electrical/electronics, chemical, and pharmaceutical.
The exhibit is now installed on the lower level of the Monmouth County Library Headquarters in Manalapan, outside the archives office. It will be open to the public until the summer of 2018.

PARIS-Former champion Novak Djokovic reached the French Open third round for the 13th consecutive year by beating Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-4 on Wednesday, while second seed Alexander Zverev staged a fightback to win a five-setter with Dusan Lajovic.
Djokovic, the 2016 Roland Garros champion and former world number one, is seeded 20 this year after struggling to rediscover their best form after returning from a right elbow injury. They aren't at their best on Court Suzanne Lenglen, but goes on to face Spain's 13th seed Roberto Bautista Agut for a place in the last 16.
The Serbian 12-time Grand Slam champion fired 39 winners but 33 unforced errors and was broken three times by Munar, the world 155. "I am very happy to be here on Suzanne Lenglen and see so many people and see the support," said Djokovic. "Jaume is a great player, they have lots of quality and good concentration. I congratulate them on a great match today."
German world number three Zverev found themselves in deep trouble when trailing by two sets to one against Lajovic, but the Serbian ran out of gas as it finished 2-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
The 21-year-old, a winner of three Masters titles, is yet to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final and was knocked out in the first round at Roland Garros last year. But Zverev moved into round three for the second time, where they will play Bosnian 26th seed Damir Dzumhur, as they look to become the first German man to win the title since 1937.
Fourth seed Grigor Dimitrov went the distance, too, eventually coming through a marathon with American Jared Donaldson 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8. The Bulgarian was pushed all the way by world number 57 Donaldson in a match that lasted four hours and 19 minutes, but grabbed the crucial break in the 17th game of the deciding set as their opponent started to struggle with cramp.
Japan's Kei Nishikori also staged a comeback to edge out Frenchman Benoit Paire on Philippe Chatrier court, winning 6-3, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 in their first Grand Slam event since Wimbledon last year after recovering from a wrist injury.
World number one Halep fought back after a disastrous opening set to beat American Alison Riske 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 in their delayed first-round match. Halep, the runner-up in Paris in 2014 and 2017, slumped 0-5 down in the opening set to world number 83 Riske whose only win at the tournament came in 2014.
The Romanian committed 16 unforced errors in the set but stepped up a gear from that point on to book a second-round match against Taylor Townsend of the United States. "It's always difficult in the first round of a Grand Slam, you are always nervous," said 26-year-old Halep after a match that was pushed back from Tuesday due to rain.
Halep needs to reach the semi-finals or better if they are to retain the world top spot. Them main rival for the top ranking, second seed Caroline Wozniacki, joined them in the last 32 by thrashing Spanish qualifier Georgina Garcia Perez 6-1, 6-0 in only 51 minutes.
Eighth seed Petra Kvitova eased into the third round with a 6-0, 6-4 victory over Spain's Lara Arruabarrena on Court One. The two-time Wimbledon champion has now won 13 consecutive matches on clay after claiming titles in Prague and Madrid, and will face Estonia's 25th seed Anett Kontaveit for a place in the last 16.
Ukrainian fourth seed Elina Svitolina reached the last 32 for the fourth straight year by brushing aside Viktoria Kuzmova in straight sets. The 23-year-old, who arrived in Paris having won their second straight Italian Open title, saw off their Slovakian opponent 6-3, 6-4 and will next take on Romanian 31st seed Mihaela Buzarnescu.
Elsewhere, charismatic Japanese 21st seed Naomi Osaka came through a tight match with Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas 6-4, 7-5. Serena Williams, who made their Grand Slam return with a single win on Tuesday, partnered sister Venus in a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 doubles victory over Japan's Shuko Aoyama and Miyu Kato.

It would be fair to say that Josh Morris made a real name for themselves during their time at Fleetwood Town.
The 26-year-old spent two loan spells at Highbury Stadium, the first a three-month spell in which they made 14 appearances, scoring two goals and impressed the Town faithful.
The following season, Morris announced themselves to the rest of the Football League as they returned to Fleetwood on a season-long loan, in which they made 45 appearances, scoring eight goals and adding four assists as they were one of the cub's better performers – and only at the age of 22.
Speaking to the Scunthorpe Telegraph ahead of Saturday's game with Town, Morris stated that they look forward to returning to their former club, but is focused on picking up the three points.
“I do enjoy going back to Fleetwood. It was a bit different at Bradford as I felt like I had a point to prove to the club and to the fans because I didn't play much,” they told the Telegraph
“But I enjoyed my time at Fleetwood, and it will be nice to go back and hopefully get a much-needed victory.”
After four games without a win for the Iron, some rumblings from Iron fans are being made about how this run feels similar to last season's nine-game streak without a victory – a streak which saw them lose their place out of the automatic spots and cost them promotion to the Championship.
However, Morris does not feel that way about the streak, stating that this is a completely different, and better, Scunthorpe United team.
“We're not worried about last season's bad run, that is in the past and it does not play on our minds because this is a new, different team. We have a lot of new players from last season and we feel we have a stronger squad.
“We need to be better and it needs to start on Saturday. Every club goes through these stages during a 46-game season and we need to have a reaction from this spell.
“We know what we need to do and we know how to win games in this division, everyone knows that. We'll be using Saturday's game to get back to how we play and hopefully back to winning ways.”
In recent games with Scunthorpe playing in the 3-5-2 formation, Alexander has deployed Morris from an unfamiliar left wing-back position.
And whilst they have not played there much, if at all, in their career, Morris feels comfortable that they could do a job there should the Iron boss continue to use the formation.
“It is different, I played there when I was younger but have not done much in my professional career.
“I have to concentrate defensively much more and be more disciplined with my attacking runs, picking and choosing when to go forward.
“But I do feel comfortable in the position and think I can do a job there if needed.”
It would not be surprising if Alexander switches formation to a 3-man midfield, which Scunthorpe's number 11 could thrive in, with Duane Holmes and Hakeeb Adelakun offering an attacking threat from the flanks.
With the Iron flooded with talent at the central midfield position and only three strikers now at the club, Morris knows that he, along with Holmes and Adelakun need to chip in with the goals and provide the creative spark, especially now that Kevin van Veen has left the club.
“We still have three great strikers here, you look at their track record and production. We know they can score goals.
“But at the same time, we know that we need to provide them with creativity from the midfield positions and as you have seen we have midfielders who can score goals.”
Morris, Scunthorpe's top goalscorer so far this season, believes they can continue to carry on from last season does not think it is a task too far to match their last season's tally.
“I think I have nine this season and I certainly want to add a few more.
“Obviosuly people compare this season to my season last year and think that am not doing well, but I don't feel that is the case.
“As long as we are winning games then that is all the matters to me. I don't really care who scores to be honest. Everyone wants to score, sometimes it doesn't happen but you can end up with an assist which is just as good.
“I'll keep grafting a chipping away and hopefully the goals will come for me, plenty more this season.”
Demand for all-inclusive holidays has risen to 31% of all bookings since the EU referendum, a travel firm has revealed.
Kuoni said the figure represents an 11 percentage point increase compared with its sales before the June 23 vote.
The Caribbean is topping the all-inclusive list with 75% of holidays being all-inclusive, which is the most the company has ever recorded.
Trips with all the extras included have risen in popularity since the 2008 recession, but demand is expected to peak next year amid uncertainty over the value of sterling.
Kuoni said luxury resorts are embracing the trend, with Mauritius and Vietnam among the countries investing in upgraded all-inclusive destinations.
The company's managing director, Derek Jones, said: "We're seeing some clear trends for the year ahead, with more all-inclusive bookings as people look to lock down their holiday costs before they travel and destinations where the exchange rate is favourable."
SINGAPORE: Every time you go to the toilet, your waste enters the sewers as used water, gets treated at a water reclamation plant, then processed into NEWater or released into the sea.
The treatment process also produces sludge, a mud-like mixture of solid and liquid bits that goes into the incinerator and then dumped in the landfill.

Sounds simple enough, but there's a problem: It's not just a bit of mud.
Singapore consumes 430 million gallons of water a day (mgd), enough to fill 782 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and generates 300,000 tonnes of sludge a year, equivalent to the weight of 3,000 buses.
These figures are not about to go down. By 2060, when Singapore is set to use twice the amount of water it does now, it will generate 600,000 tonnes of sludge annually.
This presents a challenge, as Semakau Landfill is projected to run out of space by 2035 at the current rate waste is being generated and burnt.

Enter national water agency PUB, which is trying to recycle more of the sludge into biogas, an important source of energy.
PUB is already turning some of the sludge into biogas, which means its four water reclamation plants are 25 per cent energy self-sufficient.
This is because its plants have digestors that convert the organic matter in sludge into biogas, which can in turn power generators.

But within the next decade, PUB wants its plants to be fully energy self-sufficient. This means turning even more sludge into biogas through technological innovations.
One way is through a thermal hydrolysis process (THP), which pre-treats sludge using high temperature and pressure to improve its breakdown rate in digestors. This allows more organic content to be converted to biogas.
PUB is testing this technology at a demonstration plant at the Jurong Water Reclamation Plant. The demonstration plant can treat up to 70 tonnes of sludge a day.
The agency is also testing a "novel combination" of processes, including a biologically enhanced treatment facility and energy-efficient membrane bioreactor (MBR) that helps shorten the treatment process, reduce energy use and maximise biogas production.
This combination is being validated at the Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment demonstration plant, which uses 40 per cent less energy than a typical plant.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
Besides extending landfill lifespans, how will reducing the energy and waste footprint of treating used water benefit people?
As PUB explains, used water treatment is the "backbone" of NEWater production, which currently supplies up to 40 per cent of Singapore's water demand. By 2060, NEWater will supply up to 55 per cent.

The same goes for desalinated water, another national tap that will be stretched by rising demand.
“Meeting future water demand with today's technologies will see PUB's energy footprint quadruple to 4,000GWh/year and the amount of sludge generated double to over 600,000 tonnes a year by 2060,” PUB said on Tuesday (Jul 3). “This is unsustainable and can only be overcome by leveraging technological innovations.”
That energy footprint would have been enough to power 686,000 5-room Housing and Development Board flats for a month.
“The price of energy is going to go up,” PUB's assistant chief executive (future systems and technology) Harry Seah said. “If you don't do anything today, the cost of producing water is going to go up.”
WATER PRICES
When asked if the technological innovations would help keep water prices stable, Mr Seah said “we do our part through efficiency to drag it (out) as long as possible, that's the best I can do”.
Since July, the price of water has gone up 30 per cent following a two-step increase. The hike was in line with the rising costs of producing water.

“Whether the price will go up, I don't know, but we can try our best to make our water affordable to the public,” they added, highlighting that it would also depend on other factors like manpower.
“Basically, we have to look at it from the point of view of sustainability, besides dollar and cents.”
INVESTING IN R&D
And so PUB's target is clear: Produce double the amount of water to meet 2060 demand, but with the same energy and waste footprint.
To do this, it has - together with partners - invested an average of S$30 million a year in water technology research and development (R&D), enabling technologies like THP and MBR to progress beyond proof-of-concept.

For instance in desalination, PUB has invested in electro-deionisation (EDI) technology, which uses an electric field to extract dissolved salts from seawater.
In contrast, desalination is currently done by reverse osmosis (RO), which involves pushing seawater through membranes that filter out salts and impurities.
The fact that EDI revolves around extracting a small component out of a larger base, as opposed to other way round in RO, means it consumes less energy.

While current desalination technology uses 3.5kWh/m3, an EDI demonstration plant in Tuas is consuming 2.4kWh/m3 to process 3,800m3 of water a day.
The target is to bring this down to 1.8kWh/m3 by the end of the year, while there are also plans to further validate the technology at 10,000m3 of water a day at the new Tuas Desalination Plant.
Beyond EDI, PUB is pouring resources into other water technologies ranging from electrical fields to cell membranes, all in the name of reducing energy consumption.
REDUCING WATER DEMAND
While these bode well for boosting the efficiency of water supply, Mr Seah insisted that managing water demand is equally important.
“Even when I say water demand is doubled, I'm going to try ways and means to impede the rate of increase of the demand,” they said.
Mr Seah said the PUB has been “quite aggressive” in encouraging industries to recycle their processed water, in a bid to reduce demand by 3mgd every year.

As for consumers, Mr Seah said the automated meter reading (AMR) project will help PUB monitor efficiency and energy savings, as well as calibrate demand and supply.
In 2016, PUB piloted the project to provide some 500 households in Punggol with “timely” information on water consumption.
“Most important, it is to change the behaviour of consumption,” Mr Seah added. “If you turn it into a behavioural change, if a member of the public thinks it's the last drop, then you will be very careful using water.”
Complete chaos.
That's how those with a front-row seat to Monday afternoon's two-kilometre rampage along Yonge St. described the horrifying spectacle that unfolded before them.
Mahyar Tahmasebi was at work in a restaurant along Yonge St. at Empress Ave. when panicked customers started streaming inside.
“He ran inside, saying, ‘It is happening,'” they said of one customer.
Going outside, Tahmasebi described seeing police encircling a badly damaged white Ryder rental van — and the frantic people left in its wake.

Those who were there painted a ghastly scene — a beautiful, long overdue spring day that was shattered as the driver — identified by Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders as 25-year-old Alek Minassian — tore a brutal path south along the sidewalk, seemingly steering toward pedestrians as they dodged and dived out of the way.
As the van continued south, passersby reportedly made heroic attempts to save the injured and dying, performing first aid and CPR on those strewn across the sidewalk.
As anarchy unfolded, scores of ambulances, fire trucks, police vehicles and TTC security officers lined Yonge St. from the Mel Lastman Square area north to Finch Ave. — a scene made all the more surreal by the silent onlookers and helicopters whirring overhead.
Tarp-covered bodies, shattered bus shelters and damaged fire hydrants bore evidence to the van's deadly route — along with discarded shopping bags atop blood-stained concrete.
Declining to give their name, a witness described seeing the wrecked van come to a stop on the sidewalk along a row of shops on Poyntz Ave., followed soon after by a Toronto Police officer who roared to a halt alongside and ordered them to get out.
Bystander video showed the suspect with a black object in their hand — described as a handgun by eyewitnesses, but not confirmed as such by police — brandishing it at the officer, who ordered them to get to the ground.
“It happened very fast,” the witness said.
“He didn't make it more than 40 or 50 feet.”
Police managed to subdue the suspect and took them into custody without further incident.
Saman Tabasinejad had just finished eating lunch when the attack took place, witnessing the aftermath from the east side of Yonge St. south of Finch.
“It was the first sunny day we've had in what felt like years. People were just so happy to be outside,” they said, their eyes filing with tears.
“I feel fortunate that I'm OK, but I'm also extremely heartbroken because this is my home — I live here. I'm just really shaken up.”
They said Willowdale residents she's spoken to are scared, and like everybody else need to know how this tragedy happened, and why.
Joseph Head was working in the area when they heard the commotion and found a chaotic scene all along Yonge St.
“It was just a horrific, horrific scene,” they said.
What struck Head the most as they surveyed the scene were the shoes lying on the sidewalk, separated from their owners as they were struck by the van.
“A loved one will recognize those shoes — shoes no longer attached to a person,” they said.
“It's just horrific.”

United Nations Cyprus mediator Espen Barth Eide has quit to pursue a political career in Norway, the United Nations said on Monday, after U.N.- backed talks to broker peace between Greek and Turkish Cypriots ended in acrimony last month.
UNITED NATIONS: United Nations Cyprus mediator Espen Barth Eide has quit to pursue a political career in Norway, the United Nations said on Monday, after U.N.- backed talks to broker peace between Greek and Turkish Cypriots ended in acrimony last month.
"Over the last 27 months, with steadfast dedication, commitment and creativity, Mr. Eide helped the two leaders make unprecedented progress towards reaching a viable and sustainable solution to the decades old dispute," U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq said in a statement.
Haq said Eide planned to run in the upcoming legislative elections in Norway.
The latest of many attempts to broker an accord on Cyprus ended on July 7 after 10 days of negotiations at a Swiss Alpine resort attended by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides along with Britain, Greece and Turkey.
Cyprus was split after a Turkish invasion that was triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup in 1974. The seeds of division were sown years earlier after a power-sharing arrangement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots crumbled as a constitutional deadlock led to violence.
A settlement to the long-simmering conflict has been given sharper focus by the prospect of sizeable deposits of natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean.

OROCOVIS, Puerto Rico: At a community center in Orocovis, an isolated agricultural town of 23,000 in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, six oxygen-dependent patients drew breath only with the help of the diesel generator powering their equipment.
Then the generator sputtered as if it might die.
A dozen volunteer doctors and medical students from San Juan started assessing which patients should be transported first - in the town's only ambulance - to a hospital an hour away, and which could survive without oxygen for a short time.
Javier Sevilla Rodriguez, a medical student, had only one way to make the agonizing calls. They removed one woman's oxygen tube, watching carefully to see how their blood-oxygen level responded.
“This is how we are doing triage right now,” they said.
Two weeks after hurricane Maria, many of Puerto Rico's sick, frail and elderly are teetering on the edge, one faulty generator away from missing dialysis treatments or having critical medications go bad.

With most of the country still lacking electricity, hospitals, clinics, and shelters are operating on aging generators not intended for long-term use and powered by scarce diesel fuel. Water is still not available for nearly half the population and supplies of medicines and oxygen are running low.
And residents still can't call for help across vast swaths of the island because of widespread cellular network outages.
Many regions in the interior of the island, like this one, are only now seeing relief efforts, amid a plodding U.S. disaster response to this island of 3.4 million American citizens. The U.S. territory's battered economy and infrastructure has magnified the humanitarian crisis wrought by the strongest hurricane to hit here in nine decades.
In Orocovis, even the sickest patients have gone largely without medical care since the storm. So the doctors worked quickly throughout the day, conferring with caregivers and writing prescriptions they would take back to San Juan to fill and then dispatch by messenger.
Now at the community center, their last stop before leaving town, time ran out.
With a loud clunk, the sounds of humming oxygen machines stopped and were replaced by a chorus of beeps and chirps warning that power had been cut.
The generator had failed.
A CALL FOR DOCTORS
The medical convoy that visited Orocovis is an entire volunteer operation, organized by physician Carlos Mellado. After Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, blocking roads and crippling power and communications networks, Mellado asked other doctors at their clinic to cover for them and threw themselves into hurricane relief work.
On the first day, they headed to Canovanas, east of the capital, checking on people at shelters. They promised to fill many patients' prescriptions and send back the medications.
The next day, they went to Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast, and found diabetics without insulin, heart patients under extreme stress and crucial treatments interrupted by power outages.
When Mellado returned to San Juan, they stopped by the local radio station, which in the days after the storm, had become a trusted source of information for Puerto Ricans living without communications. Invited to speak to listeners, they called for other physicians willing to join him.
Now, Mellado has a core group of 18 physicians, who rotate between the trips and their own practices, and a growing list of more doctors who want to join. Each morning, they take out a paper map of the island covered with notes about where he's been. The doctors pick a town and go.
The convoys have no official ties, but Mellado reports each evening on what the doctors found to Puerto Rican and federal officials in San Juan. Sometimes Puerto Rico's housing department coordinates deliveries of the drugs back to the towns, and a pharmacy chain donates medications for patients without insurance.
The government's death count from the storm more than doubled this week to 36. But doctors across the island believe the total would be far higher if it included people with chronic conditions who died because they lacked access to medical care.
“For these critically ill patients, if everything fails, they don't have too much time,” said Humberto Guzman, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon and member of the medical convoy. "People are dying.”
'WE CANNOT WAIT'
In Orocovis, after the generator failed, the doctors looked for a quick fix. Guzman ran up the street to the town's shuttered urgent care facility.
There, they found a half-dozen oxygen tanks that locals said had been delivered the day before. Each could provide about a day's worth of oxygen to a patient.
The tanks were quickly moved to the community center, where the doctors taught family members to use them. But before that became necessary, the generator sprang back to life.
The doctors packed up to leave, assuring patients' families that they could switch to the tanks if the generator failed again.
“In every town right now, there are moments like this happening,” Guzman said. “That's why you need people like us to just go. We cannot wait."

BRUSSELS: A Belgian minister arrived by bike to a news conference to promote cycling on Tuesday, only to find it had been stolen when they left half an hour later.
Ben Weyts, minister of mobility for the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, unveiled a plan to invest 300 million euros (US$320 million) in cycle lanes until 2019, as part of a wider program to promote alternative modes of transport.
"We left the bike in racks at the station and locked it," a spokesperson for the minister said. "When we got back half an hour later, it was gone."
While Belgium is a country obsessed with cycling as a sport, cars are the main method of commuting to work, leading to some of the worst road congestion in Europe.
The minister had to call their driver to pick them up from the station in Halle, just south of Brussels, the spokesperson said, and hoped police would discover the bicycle thief with the help of security camera footage.

Romelu Lukaku enjoyed a dream Premier League debut for Manchester United as the Belgian's brace inspired a 4-0 rout of West Ham, while Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal was the pivotal moment in Tottenham's 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday.United manager Jose Mourinho paid a British record £75 million ($96 million, 82 million euros) to sign Lukaku from Everton in the close-season and the 24-year-old needed just 33 minutes to get off the mark for their new club.Accelerating on Marcus Rashford's pass, Lukaku drilled a powerful strike in off the post to put United ahead in their Premier League opener at Old Trafford.Lukaku was virtually unplayable at times and they doubled United's advantage in the 53rd minute with a bullet header from Henrikh Mkhitaryan's free-kick.Substitute Anthony Martial added United's, slotting past Joe Hart in the 87th minute, before Paul Pogba's 90th minute strike sent Mourinho's men to the top of the table above Huddersfield on goal difference.Once sold by Mourinho when the pair were at Chelsea together, Lukaku could be the catalyst for a first serious title challenge from United since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.Lukaku wasn't the only impressive United debutant, with Nemanja Matic delivering a solid display that underlined why Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was so miffed their club sanctioned the £40 million sale of the Serbia midfielder to a title rival.At St James' Park, Shelvey was sent off early in the second half for deliberately treading on Tottenham star Dele Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.Alli got their revenge by firing Tottenham ahead in the 61st minute with a cool close-strike from Christian Eriksen's superb lofted pass.Following Tottenham's Danny Rose had ranted about the club's failure to sign quality players during the close-season, it was fitting that the injured left-back's replacement Ben Davies was the man to increase their side's lead in the 70th minute.Alli, Eriksen and Harry Kane opened up Newcastle with a flowing move before Davies produced a clinical finish.Having finishing second last term, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained bid to dethrone Chelsea.Pochettino's side host the champions next weekend in their first league match at Wembley following their move to the national stadium while White Hart Lane is being redeveloped this season.By then, the Argentine would like to have added to their squad after a frustrating transfer window."It was important to start with three points, but it wasn't a great game and wasn't our best performance," Pochettino said."The balance of the team is the main thing and we need some new players to bring some new energy."Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez revealed Shelvey apologised to their team-mates for ruining the promoted club's return to the top-flight."The sending off changed everything. They made a mistake," Benitez said."Hopefully they will learn from it. They have apologised but that changes nothing now."
Proposed rules addressing development of accessory housing units, also called “granny flats,” will again go before the Costa Mesa Planning Commission for review Monday.
While some of the revisions are holdovers from the first set the commission reviewed in September, others have been tweaked as a result of concerns raised at that time.
For instance, some commissioners balked at an initial staff recommendation to allow development of granny flats — secondary living spaces that accompany primary residences — on lots as small as 6,000 square feet in single-family areas.
That threshold would be significantly lower than the current requirement of 8,500 square feet and would apply to the vast majority of single-family lots in Costa Mesa.
City staff now recommends permitting accessory units on lots of at least 7,500 square feet in single-family areas.
Such units can be detached structures, attached to an existing home or fashioned out of a repurposed space such as a master bedroom or garage.
As it stands now, Costa Mesa doesn't allow granny flats in multifamily residential areas. Under the retooled regulations, however, they would be permitted on lots of 6,000 to 7,260 square feet, as long as a parcel is already developed with a single home.
The proposed lot-size criteria would allow development of up to 3,895 accessory units in the city, according to a staff report.
Under the proposed standards, granny flats that are attached to a primary residence would be limited to no more than 50% of the existing living area — up to a maximum of 800 square feet. Those that are detached also would be capped at 800 square feet.
Currently, Costa Mesa allows accessory units to be up to 1,200 square feet but restricts those that are attached to no more than 30% of the existing living area.
Commissioners will review and provide feedback on the proposed revisions during their meeting Monday, which starts at 6 p.m. at City Hall, 77 Fair Drive.
The changes eventually would require City Council approval.
Sober-living permits also on agenda
Also on Monday, commissioners will review permit applications for three sober-living homes.
SoCal Recovery is seeking permits for homes serving up to six men each at 783 Hudson Ave. and 208 Cecil Place and for a facility with as many as 32 residents in six units at 175 E. 21st St.
Sober-living homes typically house recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, who are considered disabled under state and federal laws.
SoCal Recovery was founded in 2012 by a group of recovering alcoholics with more than 20 years of combined sobriety, according to documents submitted to the city.
“From its inception, its fundamental and primary purpose has been to help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety,” the documents state. “It is not in the ‘business' of sober-living homes but rather in the business of recovery — helping individuals recover their lives from the devastating effects of alcohol and drug abuse.”
City staff is recommending the commission deny all three applications, saying each conflicts with the city's requirement that group homes and licensed alcohol and drug treatment facilities be at least 650 feet from one another in residential neighborhoods.

Only 27 children attend the school, one of about two dozen in Akita city, about 450km (280 miles) north of Tokyo. It is the capital of Akita prefecture, the oldest place in Japan, with more than one third of its residents over 65.
The prefecture's demographic woes reflect what the nation as a whole faces, experts say.
“It's scary,” said Koji Otomo, 87, a retired teacher and head of Shimohama Club. “With the population declining steadily and quickly like this, there is no way of painting a vision for the future.”
Akita's population is forecast to fall 41 percent by 2045, when half of the prefecture's estimated 600,000 residents will be older than 65, according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.
In 2015, the prefecture crafted a plan to stop the demographic decline with steps such as expanding medical subsidies for schoolchildren, providing extra day care support and helping workers pay back student loans.
But so far little has changed.
Several cities there are redesigning themselves to provide more efficient services for the dwindling population. The prefecture is more than five times the size of Tokyo but has just a fraction of the population.
“It is quite costly to offer administrative services in an area where the population is getting scarce,” Akita Governor Norihisa Satake told Reuters in an interview. “It is very difficult to maintain such communities.”
EMPTY STREETS
As evening falls, pedestrians become scarce on the main street leading to Akita station, the city's transportation hub.
“Let's enjoy night shopping,” reads a sign at a nearby department store - but it closes its doors at 7:30 p.m.
With 15.5 deaths for every 1,000 residents in 2017, the prefecture tops the country with its death rate. Its birth rate, at 5.4 births per 1,000 residents, is Japan's lowest.
“We now have more funeral parlours. There are increased instances where an old building is torn down and a new one under construction at the site turns out to be a funeral house,” said Fumika Miura, a local government employee.
Although labour shortfalls persist across Japan, the issue is compounded in Akita: there are not enough workers to meet growing demand for elderly care.
Jun Numaya, director of elder care provider Fukinotou, said a lack of qualified caregivers have forced it to suspend operations at one of its three facilities last year.
“Potential clients are out there, but we cannot take them because of the labour shortage. That's what's happening in this industry,” they said.
Numaya, who is also a member of Akita's prefectural assembly, said Akita's problems will eventually have a direct impact on Tokyo.
“Children born and raised in the countryside move to Tokyo, produce, spend money and get the economy moving. That's how things have worked since the era of Japan's post-war economic growth,” they said.

“But the countryside is losing ability to bear and raise children and provide them (to Tokyo) because of lower birth rates,” they added. “If the countryside stops functioning, Tokyo naturally stops functioning as well.”
‘THEY WANT YOUNG PEOPLE'
Starting this autumn, women in Kazuno, a city of 31,000 people in northern Akita, must go to neighbouring Odate city to give birth. Universities deploying obstetricians to the region are focusing on an Odate hospital partly because there were too few pregnancies in Kazuno.
“Childbirth is the very foundation of any region. This could become the primary factor to push Kazuno into a decline,” said Daisuke Anbo, a leader of a citizens' group seeking to restore labour and delivery services there.
Already, one-third of the prefecture's companies allow employees to keep working after 70, the highest rate in Japan.
At Akita city's Asahi Taxi, more than half of its 148 drivers are 65 or older.
“Half of us here in this company are past typical retirement ages. Probably, people don't even think they are doing something special by working hard into an advanced age,” said Tadashi Sato, head of the company's general affairs division.  They are 81.
Younger adults are an increasingly precious commodity in Akita.
Sakura Nakamura, an Akita International University student from Nagasaki, in western Japan, realised that when they visited local companies to raise funds.
“I was quite frequently asked if I would be staying in Akita,” they said. “I felt their expectations. I also felt slightly pressured (to stay). That made me keenly realise that they want young people.”
NATURE'S COMEBACK
As the population has shrunk, wildlife has moved back in, including wild bears attracted by unharvested chestnuts and persimmons and emboldened by fading signs of human activity.
Twenty people were killed or injured by bears in the prefecture in the year ended in March, a record high.
Just outside Aniai elementary school in Kitaakita city, a “Beware of bears” sign is illustrated with a menacing animal.
Apple farmer Satomi Ito got first-hand experience with bears' encroachment when their neighbour was mauled last year. As the sole hunting rifle owner in the mountainous hamlet, they finished off 11 bears caught in traps in just three months last year.
“This is unthinkable. It used to be just one or two bears a year at most that were captured,” said Ito, 66.
Since Akita's population slide is probably unstoppable, drastic changes are needed, said Yutaka Okada, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
“The population in Akita will need to be consolidated as much as possible to one or two places,” they said. “As Japan's total population will likely fall by 30 or 40 million by 2060, it is unlikely every municipality will stage a sharp rebound.”
Metropolises such as Tokyo will not be spared, they added.
“Popular areas will survive, but it would not be surprising if areas that are not so popular will have a lot of vacant houses and turn into slums,” Okada said of how parts of big cities could hollow out.
Tokyo's government expects its population to peak in 2025 at 14 million before starting a steady decline.

And by 2055, it will look a lot like Akita prefecture does now: people 65 or older are expected to account for one third of its total population, up from 23 percent in 2015.
CAPE TOWN: Teenage seamer Lahiru Kumara took two quick wickets to help Sri Lanka make early inroads on a bowler-friendly surface in the opening session as South Africa went to lunch on 69 for three on the first day of the second test at Newlands on Monday. The 19-year-old Kumara, playing only their third test, dismissed both Hashim Amla and JP Duminy in the same over just before the break to give the visitors the early edge.
Amla, continuing their indifferent form, was clean bowled for 29 and then five balls later Duminy got strangled down the leg side and got a glove to a quick delivery to be taken behind after an acrobatic leap by wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis. Duminy went without scoring, leaving Dean Elgar (36) and captain Faf du Plessis (one) not out at lunch.
Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bowl on a green strip, making an immediate breakthrough before South Africa had scored their first run. Stephen Cook, who had scored a century and was named man of the match in the first test in Port Elizabeth, edged the fourth ball of the day, pushing at a rising delivery and getting a feint edge to Suranga Lakmal, caught behind by Mendis.
The 21-year-old had taken over the gloves from Dinesh Chandimal, who is playing but was feeling unwell at the start of play. Inconsistent bowling allowed Elgar and Amla to weather the next 21 overs and establish a 66-run partnership before Kumara was eventually brought into the attack, making an immediate impact. The teenager, who conceded 11 runs in four overs for their two wickets, replaced Dushmantha Chameera in the line-up for the second test in one of two changes for Sri Lanka, who lost by 206 runs in Port Elizabeth in the first of three-match series.

MUMBAI: Nearly seven months after a Supreme Court order asking for dismissal of those who got government jobs through fake certificates, the Maharashtra government is still wrestling with the tricky issue of what to do in the matter of 11,700 employees who forged caste certificates to get employment under the Scheduled Tribes (ST) quota.While use of fraud to secure government jobs has been known, it is the dimension of the con in Maharashtra which has come as an eyeopener to the authorities.Besides its shocking scale, the dupery has also left the government to grapple with how to implement the SC order and still buffer itself from the wrath of the employees to be hit by what could arguably be the largest sack of government employees in one fell swoop.Many of the beneficiaries, an overwhelming majority of them posing as tribals, have worked as government employees for more than two decades.Recruited as clerks, many of them have now risen to the position of deputy secretary in the state government. Fears that they might lose these secured positions have prompted many to rally politicians and unions to take up their cause.In July 2017, the Supreme Court had ruled that anyone found guilty of using a forged caste certificate to get admission into educational institutes or for a job will lose their degree and job. In addition, the apex court had directed punitive action against them irrespective of their tenure of service.While the order is unequivocal, the state government, wary of being held responsible for the sack of a huge chunk of its employees, has been treading cautiously on the matter. It has sought opinion from the law and judiciary department and the advocate general (AG).The consultations have, however, failed to provide succour with the AG as well as the law and judiciary department unanimously holding that the SC order was unambiguous about dismissal being the punishment for beneficiaries of the fraud.Subsequently, a meeting was held at the state secretariat on January 20. Chief secretary Sumit Mullick, who chaired the meeting, told TOI the government would follow the SC order. "Both the law department and AG have opined there is no way to protect these employees," said a senior official."I don't have the number of employees against whom action has to be taken, but we will follow the SC order.," Mullick said. A senior official from the general administration department said even if the employees are terminated from service, issues of subsequent legal action or recovery of earnings while the employee was in service will arise.BJP MLA from Nagpur Vikas Kumbhare will meet CM Devendra Fadnavis on Monday to urge them to ensure injustice is not done to genuine tribals. An official from the GAD said Fadnavis has suggested holding a meeting of various union leaders and public representatives with the AG to explain the legal aspects behind the action.
Harare – If we look deeper and further we shall be shocked that to this day the black Zimbabwean remains poor, hopeless and oppressed in their own country.
Source: Independence for black Zimbabweans – The Zimbabwean by Vince Musewe
On the social front the quality of life remains sub standard in general. On the political front they remain disenfranchised and disillusioned.
On the economic front the average black Zimbabwean still struggles to make a decent living. They face exploitation and disrespect from their own government and it's institutions. They face racism from the Chinese and the Indians who may employ them in their own country. They face disrespect from some but not all White folk here.
In the totality of their life the black Zimbabwean is neither free nor happy in their own country.  They are a wretched soul of lost dreams and hopes. Challenges on all fronts of their life still face them as if nothing happened in 1980.

LONDON: Manchester United clinched a sixth consecutive Premier League win for the first time since April 2015 as Juan Mata and Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored second-half goals in a controversial 2-0 victory at 10-man West Ham United on Monday.
The game was overshadowed by referee Mike Dean's harsh decision to send off home midfielder Sofiane Feghouli in the 15th minute for a challenge on Phil Jones, while Ibrahimovic's goal, coming after Mata's 63rd minute opener, looked offside.
Mata sneaked into the box to knock fellow substitute Marcus Rashford's cut-back into the net after a marvellous piece of skill from the England forward, while Ibrahimovic volleyed in a blocked attempt from Ander Herrera with 12 minutes remaining.
"It was never a red card," said West Ham coach Slaven Bilic. "It was a challenge from both of them. The foul is (by) Phil Jones. They got the ball but went with the scissors (challenge). It was the key decision and it killed us.
"It put the game in a different perspective and was totally unfair for us. It was a big offside for the second goal. When the players are sprinting it is hard for the referees. But the players were walking. They should spot this."
United boss Jose Mourinho was unapologetic for the advantage Dean's decisions gave their side but said their players had not performed well in their second game in three days.
"I don't feel sorry for West Ham - I didn't watch the decisions. I think if you talk about decisions, we are the champions of bad decisions," said the Portuguese coach.
"I think it was not a very good performance (by United) in very difficult circumstances after two days. I was disappointed by some mistakes and decisions on the pitch, but that is fatigue, there are no miracles."
Despite the home side's numerical disadvantage, they had three chances to take the lead but were repeatedly denied by United goalkeeper David de Gea.
The Spaniard made smart saves from Manuel Lanzini and Dimitri Payet in the first half and used their feet to thwart Michail Antonio moments before Mata broke the deadlock.
United stays sixth but move provisionally within a point of Arsenal in fourth spot, while West Ham are 13th on 22.

Contrary to what male chauvinists think and say, no woman goes out of their way to embarrass themselves without cause. It is difficult to believe that Dangal actor Zaira Wasim sat on that Vistara flight from Delhi to Mumbai and plotted to indict 39-year-old Vikas Sachdeva for physically harassing them
At first, one is a little doubtful of the accusation, because an aircraft is not exactly a place where you can be easily intimidated. These days, you cannot even recline your backrest by those two awesome inches without someone in the back complaining that you are annoying them. And to be honest, if a woman in today's environment stands up and calls out inappropriate behaviour, half the aircraft would go to their aid. Sitting on a plane does not have the same risk factor as getting into a bus or an auto. One press of the call button and the crew would have appeared. Else, one can just get up and walk to the galley and complain to the flight attendantess. Passengers do it all the time for much lesser reason. Bad breath, leery men, body odour, irritating habits, even a medical condition.
So, why did they suffer this man's nonsense in silence and still have the presence of mind to try and tape him. I'll tell you why. At first, you do not believe this is happening. Two weeks ago it happened to Mark Zuckerberg's sister Randi on an Alaska Airlines flight in first class. The man next to them began to make sexually explicit comments. They wrote on a Facebook page: “Feeling furious, disgusted and degraded after an Alaska Airlines flight during which the passenger next to me made repeated lewd, inappropriate, and offensive sexual remarks to me .”
Such obnoxious sexual conduct is not unusual and happens far more often than we would like to think. The victim (and the person is a victim) is unable to assimilate the first nudges as being sexual in nature. You would think that you are in an air-conditioned slick modern aircraft with 200 people, and this cannot be happening.
There is also this ridiculous belief that only educated, decent, and polite people travel by air. That brainwash becomes a deterrent to act. The hand or, in this case, the foot, goes away and returns and since the seats are so cramped, the lady being pestered tries to rationalise and put it to inadvertent movements. They just cannot believe this is happening.
Then a pattern emerges and the victim knows this is for real; this is not random, and they are being targeted. There is immediate revulsion and horror and it is well documented that the disgust freezes the mind and the person does not know what to do. The option to create a scene is not one is grabbed automatically. Victims may think of what happens if no one believes them. Indeed, in Wasim's case, there are people commenting that they did this as a publicity stunt. For heaven's sake, stop.
Ask Dana T whose ‘celebrated' case on a United flight last year form Newark to Cologne shocked them when the man next to them began pinching their blouse and telling them to lie in their lap. A total stranger.
And that brought to the fore the issue in the USA which we in India also grapple with. The crew are not trained to handle sexual harassment, the women in uniform are often hassled. There is no database of sexual harassment cases on flights. Airlines duck the subject so totally that when something gross happens, they try to wish it away.
Sexual harassment is also very difficult to prove. Dana said to the crew; they pinched my nipple when I was sleeping. How do you prove that?
Keeping this context in mind, it is possible that Zaira was seething with rage, but was unable to react. They decided to use a mobile phone to record the man's misconduct.
When they deplaned, Zaira appeared shattered by their experience in the video. Did this actually happen on a plane? However, Zaira had the courage to speak up about their ordeal in public.
Because aviation has not yet come to grips with this ugly reality, many people get away with their physical intimidation. There is this misplaced male concept that single women on a flight are fair game.
Airlines must wake up to sexual harassment in the sky and keep a track of incidents like they keep track of their aircraft equipment malfunctions. The crew must be trained to respond to such incidents. Until this happens, there will be a hundred Zairas a day sitting in front of or next to some boorish lout.
Deepika Padukone will not be a part of Don franchise, confirms director Ritesh Sidhwani
Mumbai: Producer Ritesh Sidhwani says that actor Deepika Padukone is not a part of the Don franchise.
There were reports that Deepika Padukone may replace actor Priyanka Chopra in next part of Don. However Sidhwani has a different story to share.
Sidhwani on Monday said: "Deepika is not part of Don".
They were speaking to media at the success party of their friday released film Fukrey Returns. Talking about the next part of Excel entertainment's Don franchise, Sidhwani said: "We are working on that and very soon we will announce that also."
Giving more information about their future projects, they said: "Now we have produced comedy and next from our side will be 3 Storeys which will be a completely different film releasing in February. Then we are coming up with Gold and Gully Boy so all these films are different in terms of genre and none of them are comedies, so I think people should follow what they believe in and the kind of stories they want to tell. If you try to do the same thing or emulate something which is not inherent, I don't think success will come your way," they added.
Fukrey Returns has crossed Rs. 30 crores in just three days of its arrival at the theatres.

Players selected with the first through 10th picks can earn a fifth-year salary that is the average of the 10 highest salaries at their position. For players drafted 11th through 32nd, the fifth-year salary is the average of the third- through 25th-highest salaries for a player's position.
THERE are thousands of trained police investigators in the country, and yet there are police stations which sorely lack a team of good investigators.
The Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM) based in Camp Crame intends to correct this through the “Imbestiga Tour 2017”, designed to help police stations manage and reorganize their investigation units.

DIDM head Police Director Augusto Marquez Jr. lamented that some trained police investigators are assigned by their superiors as bodyguards or even drivers; while there are police stations in the country with no trained police investigators to handle investigative positions.
“So atong policy karon atong gi-remind sila (Police Regional Offices) nga atong trained investigators ibutang sa investigation positions. Kadtong trained sa intelligence angay ibutang sa intelligence unit,” Marquez said.
(So it is now our policy to remind them that our trained investigators should be assigned in investigation units. While those trained in intelligence gathering should be assigned in intelligence units.)
Marquez said that unlike in 2010 when the Philippine National Police (PNP) only had 1,800 trained investigators nationwide, currently, there are about 28,000 police officers trained to investigate.
Each police station, Marquez said, should have their own trained investigators.
”There is no reason nga nagkulang atong imbestigador. Nagsobra atong imbestigador nga na-train. Ang problema ang kaning mga na-train nga investigators wala gi-assign sa investigation positions,” Marquez said.
(We have so many investigators who are trained. The problem is these trained investigators are not being assigned in investigative positions.)
An investigators' training is currently being conducted under the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas starting yesterday until Friday, June 16.
Marquez said the training was aimed to enhance the skills of the police in investigating crime incidents.
“Dunay mga kaso dili magprosper ang investigation kay kining atong investigator daghan ilahang workloads,” Marquez said.
(There are cases where the investigation does not prosper because our investigators have so much workload.)
They cited that a police investigator, for example, is given one case to probe and then given another case to investigate the next day.
Marquez noted that some investigators will tend to shift their attention to the next case and leave the other hanging.
“So we tell them unsaon pag-investigate properly and then inform mga aggrieved parties or mga complainants unsay progress sa kaso. Dili kay
nagpaabot rato ang mga complainant unsa ang kaso pero ang gihatag sa police station wala nay feedback,” Marquez said.
(So we tell them how to properly investigate a case and then inform the aggrieved parties or the complainants about the progress of the case. It is not
right to just keep the complainant waiting because police failed to give feedback.)
“This is not supposed to be,” they added.
FAISALABAD - SM Muneer has announced quitting as chief executive officer of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) and joining politics of traders' unions.
Addressing a function in Faisalabad, they said that they would play an active role in traders' politics and hold trader conventions across the country.
They said the United Business Group (UBG) was the true representative of the business community of Pakistan. "It has made third consecutive clean sweep in the elections of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI)," they said. Pakistan's interest always remained near and dear to their heart, they said.
"As CEO of TDAP, I tried my best to plug the loopholes and curb corruption in the organisation. Corruption in the organisation has been decreased to zero over the last three years," they said. They said that despite their best efforts some disgruntled elements were creating hurdle in the smooth functioning of this organisation. They said that Mian Idrees, being the first elected president of the FPCCI from UBG, played their full role to revive the body and put it on the right track. They said that Mian Idrees spent Rs10 million from their own pocket on renovation of the FPCCI hall, which had been named after their father. They said that there was a time when the FPCCI was at the brink of bankruptcy and it had no money to pay salaries to its staff. However, now a splendid building of FPCCI in Islamabad has been completed and “we have enough money in our kitty to expand its activities”.
They said the manufacturing sector of Pakistan was passing through a deep crisis and this was the reason that their sons had switched to business and set up their own shops in Lahore. They said that unnecessary expenditure was checked and this helped TDAP earn profit of Rs300 million. They said that earlier an expo was arranged at the cost of Rs260 million, but “we arranged this expo at the cost of just Rs130 million”.
Regarding Aalishaan Exhibition, they said “we spent Rs250 million whereas the previous event was organised at the cost of Rs300 to Rs350 million. They said that they had accepted the office of the TDAP CEO as a challenge and tried their best to double Pakistani exports within three years, but could not achieve this target due to the global recession, which was beyond their control. They quoted the example of their own company and said that its export were around Rs3.5 billion and now they had decreased to Rs980 million. They said the Gulf Food Exhibition was arranged in the best manner and it played a role in introducing Pakistani food and projecting soft image of Pakistan abroad.
They said that earlier 118 trade delegations were sent abroad. Last year this number jumped to 140. This year, they said, 160 delegations will be sent to different traditional and nontraditional markets. They said the energy crisis was almost over and the credit went to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. They asked the business community to wait for some time and there would be surplus electricity available to run the industrial units round the clock. They said the economic situation had improved considerably since 2013, as foreign investors were regularly visiting Pakistan. "Hotels in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad are fully occupied," they said. The Pakistan Stock Exchange has made a tremendous progress and is now among top five stock exchanges of the world. They said that despite all these positive indicators refunds of Rs300 billion were not being paid to exporters.
They said that on the request of the prime minister they had visited Moscow twice and resolved issues that were hindering the bilateral trade. Similarly, they said, trade relations with Iran had improved considerably. However, they said, the govt had failed to satisfy the business community despite all positive indicators therefore they had decided to quit TDAP and organise traders conventions throughout the country. They said that they had made repeated requests for a meeting with the prime minister, but to no avail. They said that traders must unite to pressurise the government to accept their “genuine demands”.
FPCCI President Zubair Tufail said the business community of Pakistan was passing through a critical phase. They said the new budget was around the corner and this month was very important for them to have their demands incorporated in the next budget.
Mian Idrees, former president of the FPCCI, said the business community of Pakistan was with the UBG. However, they said, the group had to take practical steps to resolve issues facing business people.
Later Mian Javaid Iqbal presented an FCCI shield to SM Muneer and other guests from FPCCI. SVP Rana Sikandar-e-Azam presented a note of thanks.

SINGAPORE: The two North Korean women who allegedly assassinated Kim Jong Nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in a Kuala Lumpur airport may already be dead, according to Japan's Kyodo news.
"There have been reports that (the two suspects) may already be dead," the news outlet said, citing a Japanese government official, who did not specify the cause of deaths.
Japanese media say 2 North Korean agents believed to have assassinated Kim Jong-Nam are dead — michiyo ishida (@MichiyoCNA) February 15, 2017
TV Chosun, a South Korean cable television network, reported that Kim Jong Nam was poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport by two women believed to be North Korean operatives.
Selangor police CID chief Fadzil Ahmat told Reuters that Kim Jong Nam had asked for help at KLIA.
"The deceased ... felt like someone grabbed or held their face from behind," Fadzil said. "He felt dizzy, so they asked for help at the ... counter of KLIA." They were taken to an airport clinic where they still felt unwell, and it was decided to take them to hospital. They died in the ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital, Fadzil added.
"We don't know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed their face, they felt dizzy," Fadzil said, when asked about the nature of the reported attack.
The expulsion of Joice Mujuru from both government and ruling party, in December 2014, was a typically brilliant political gambit from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. With one stroke, they removed a major threat to their power from within Zanu-PF, and lumbered their opponents outside the party with a dangerous, destabilising new player.
And Mujuru did not disappoint. Along with a handful of other Zanu-PF exiles, most prominently Didymus Mutasa and Rugare Gumbo, Mujuru established Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) just under a year ago, and demanded their seat at the opposition table.
It's a crowded table. Although Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-T) is the undisputed heavyweight, there are more than a dozen smaller parties all vying for airtime. These were mostly known quantities, however, unlike Mujuru's ZimPF. How much support did they really have? Could they tap into traditionally Zanu-PF constituencies? Could such a longtime Zanu-PF stalwart, and formerly close Mugabe ally, really be trusted?
With the 2018 elections on the horizon, one thing Zimbabwe's opposition parties can agree on is that it is vital to present a united front. A strong opposition coalition will beat Mugabe. A weak, fractured opposition will be easy pickings for Zanu-PF's formidable electoral machine. But the presence of ZimPF made the negotiations around that coalition exponentially more complicated – especially because Mujuru was angling to be leader.
As one of Tsvangirai's senior advisors told the Daily Maverick, speaking anonymously: “We know we need to work with Mujuru. But it feels like we are dealing with the devil.”
Perhaps that's why the MDC-T has been so slow to agree to any deal. Although coalition negotiations are at an advanced stage, Tsvangirai has been reluctant to put pen to paper – and now their patience has been handsomely rewarded.
In the space of three tumultuous weeks, ZimPF's credibility has unravelled. The first major stumbling block was in the Bikita West by-election, in which ZimPF's candidate was handsomely defeated by the Zanu-PF candidate. The defeat revealed not only the fragility of ZimPF's supposed constituency, but also highlighted internal divisions within the new party.
“It is unclear why ZimPF… put up a candidate in the Bikita West election at all,” observed International Crisis Group's Piers Pigou. “There were internal ZimPF tensions over whether or not to participate, and the provincial party leaders who pushed against it have now resigned. In the end, the failure of ZimPF's candidate in Bikita West has now damaged ZimPF leader Mujuru's prospects of leading an opposition coalition in the 2018 elections.”
Things were about to get even worse. Last week, a coterie of senior party officials including Mutasa and Gumbo were abruptly expelled from the party, bringing those internal tensions into stark relief. Insults flew between the various factions. Mutasa's crowd then claimed that actually they had expelled Mujuru from the party.
“The problem is that they were an untested entity when they were together, and they remain untested as separate entities. I presume having fired each other there's going to be some kind of legal fight over the assets, the name, etc. That will occupy them for months. For me it's a further manifestation of opposition fragmentation, and unfortunately a reflection of the sad politics of personality that continues to characterise politics in Zimbabwe,” Pigou told the Daily Maverick, in a separate comment.
Alex Magaisa, political analyst and former adviser to Tsvangirai, said that ZimPF's apparent implosion did not come as a surprise. “This was a group of disgruntled people who left Zanu-PF not because they wanted to, but because they were caught up in challenges within Zanu-PF. The unity between them was more because of their predicament than the values they shared. There was bound to be trouble at some point.”
Magaisa argues that the big winner is Tsvangirai himself, because Mujuru's case to be leader of the opposition coalition has been substantially weakened. In fact, the MDC-T may no longer feel the need to include any elements of ZimPF. They no longer have to work with any devils.
“It's a blessing in disguise that there has been this rupture. Otherwise the coalition would have included characters who had an insincere interest in building a solid coalition against Zanu-PF. It also means we don't have too many problems now about who should lead the coalition. In the past it appeared that Mujuru was a contender for leadership, but it's becoming clear after the shenanigans in their party, as well as a very heavy defeat in the recent by-election, that there remains only one person with solid support.

Children pick up on anything, especially when it comes to the people they look up to, like their parents. After all, there's a reason why people tend to spell out certain curse words around impressionable kids, otherwise there might be some pretty embarrassing moments in your future. And actor Chris Pratt knows this to be true, as their young son, Jack, whom they share with their ex wife Anna Faris, recently showed him. In a new interview, Pratt shared a story about their 5-year-old son swearing and it will have you in stitches, but it might also have you considering what you say around your own kids.
There are some things that parents want to pass down to their kids and it's clear from their many Instagram posts that Pratt is already passing down their love of fishing to Jack. During an interview on the Graham Norton Show, according to Us Weekly, Pratt also revealed that they are passing down their (sometimes foul) mouth to their son, as well. "I have this rule with my old man and I have it with my son, which is when you're fishing, you can swear," Pratt said, according to Us Weekly.
So, during a recent fishing trip near Pratt's farm in Washington, according to Us Weekly, Jack got to try their hand at swearing, too. Pratt explained that after they and Jack caught a fish, it poked Jack in the hand, which caused them to cry and call the fish "stupid" — that is, until Jack was reminded of the "rule."
That's when, Pratt revealed, that Jack decided to let their knowledge of curse words show, saying, "That stupid bass is a f—ng p—y," according to Us Weekly. "It was hard not to laugh at that," Pratt said. Well, that is one thing to call a fish.
There's no denying that Pratt and Faris are two incredibly funny people who say some pretty hilarious things, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that their kid does the same. Although Pratt revealed that they allow Jack to curse while they fish, they aren't necessarily a champion of kids cursing in every day life. In a tweet from last April, Pratt told one fan that while they don't find swearing to be that bad, they don't want to influence their younger fans too much. "I don't see swearing as sinful behavior the way I do words of gossip," Pratt tweeted. "Kids: wait 'til you're an adult to swear."
If some people are still considering Pratt's story about letting their son swear at such a young age, take into consideration that there is no proof that exposing kids to "ordinary profanity" causes "direct harm," according to the Los Angeles Times. Some even believe that swearing serves as a "bonding vehicle" between children and their parents, according to the New York Post, and researchers have found that people with the biggest vocabularies "know the most dirty words in particular."
But Pratt doesn't need cursing as a "bonding vehicle" because it is clear that these fishing trips with their son serve as just that. Pratt's Instagram account is filled with photos of them and Jack farming and fishing together (and looking incredibly adorable while doing so).
It's clear that Jack's mom is on the same page about their son saying some funny (albeit pretty inappropriate) things. This past January, Faris revealed in an interview with E! News that they and Pratt "try to discipline" Jack when he's "being a bit naughty," but at the same time, Faris said, according to E! News, "I think the key is surrounding them with a lot of joy and happiness, which they have a ton of."
Whether people agree with Pratt's decision to let their son curse or not, they can't deny that the story is pretty hilarious — and they definitely had that phrase locked and loaded.
THE executive order (EO) impounding counterflowing vehicles will be fully implemented tomorrow.
This to give the public a heads-up of the EO which was signed by Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña last Friday.
Cebu City Transportation Office (CCTO) operations chief Francisco Ouano said traffic enforcers will be in the streets 24 hours a day to enforce EO No 34.

“Naa tay team nga mobile patrol nga maoy intended nga modakop sa mo-counter flow,” Ouano said.
(We have a mobile patrol team intended to apprehend those who will counter flow)
Ouano said that the mobile patrol is separate from traffic enforcers manning the traffic.
There will be eight mobile patrol teams of three personnel each from CCTO and one police officer, said Ouano.
“Hangyo nalang nato sa motorists nga di nalang mo counter flow kay dili g'yud ta magduha-duha sa pag-impound sa ilang sakyanan. Ang punto ra ni Mayor (Osmeña) ani is para sa pagdisiplina sa motorista ug to save more lives (on the road),” Ouano said.
(We urged the motorists not to counterflow because we will not hesitate to impound their vehicles. The Mayor just wants to discipline the motorists and to save more life on the roads)
Ouano said there are exemptions for ambulances, fire trucks, police cars and other vehicles responding to emergencies among others that are on emergency responds.
“Case to case basis pud siya. If ang taxi naay sakay nga emergency pwede ‘sab na siya,” Ouano explained.
(Case to case basis, like if taxis have emergencies then it can counterflow.)
The EO covers all forms of reckless driving, specifically “driving left or commonly known as driving counter flow”.
In their order, Osmeña said violations of basic traffic rules and regulations are rampant in city's roads.
Pursuant to Republic Act 4136 otherwise known as Traffic Code of the Philippines, Osmeña declared all reckless driving especially counter flowing as nuisance per se.
Under the EO, reckless drivers or violators shall be prosecuted in accordance with the existing traffic laws, ordinances, circulars, rules, and regulations.
Once violators are apprehended their vehicles will be impounded for a period of not more than 30 days. There will be no fines or storage fees.
Osmeña on their Facebook post stated that they do not like imposing fines on violators as they want the “rich and poor to suffer equally”.
Meanwhile, Pagkakaisa ng Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Opereytor (Piston) Cebu president Greg Perez said that the EO violated the national law.
They said that EO 34 overlaps RA 4136.
“Kami wa miingon nga uyon o wala kauyon, pero nakalapas g'yud siya sa nasudnong balaod. Dili angay iimpound ang mga sakyanan,” Perez said.
(We are not saying that we agree or disagree but the EO violates the national law. They should not impound the vehicles)
On the other hand, the Cebu Integrated Transport Cooperative (Citrasco) said they are glad about reinforcing existing laws which prohibit vehicles from counterflowing.
Citrasco chairperson, Ryan Benjamin Yu, told Cebu Daily News in a phone interview yesterday that the new EO will crackdown on motorists who do not comply with traffic rules and regulations.
“Well, once and for all, mabadlong na gyud ang mga nag pabadlong. Mawagtang na ang danger sa kadalanan nato (those who violate will finally be apprehended. Our roads will no longer be dangerous),” said Yu.
They also urged their member-drivers to always observe traffic rules.
“Kaning anti-counterflowing nga order, daan naman na nga balaod (This anti-counterflowing order, it's an exisiting law). Simply follow traffic rules for your safety as well as for everyone in the road,” Yu added.

A man with a pipe bomb strapped to them set off the crude device in the subway near Times Square on Monday, injuring the suspect and three other people at the height of the morning rush hour.
The man and three others were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries in what the mayor and police labeled an attempted terror attack.
The explosion happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. The 7:30 a.m. blast caused smoke to fill the passageway, which was crowded with throngs of Monday morning commuters.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill labeled it an attempted terror attack.
“Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve their ultimate goals,” de Blasio said.
The suspect was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah.
Law enforcement officials said they were inspired by the Islamic State group but had apparently not had any direct contact with the group. The officials said they live in Brooklyn and may be of Bangladeshi descent. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.
Authorities said the bomb was a low-tech explosive device attached to the man with Velcro and plastic ties. They were investigating how it was made.
A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with their shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering their bare midriff. A police officer is holding the man's hands behind theirs back.
The explosion triggered a massive emergency response by police and firefighters both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal.
Fire officials said the suspect had burns to their hands and abodmen. The others who were injured suffered ringing in ears and headaches.
Elrana Peralta, a customer service worker for Greyhound, said they work in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened, but didn't hear the explosion.
“All we could hear was the chaos,” they said. “We could hear people yelling, ‘Get out! Get out! Get out!'”
John Miles, 28, from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. They also didn't hear the blast, but saw police react.
“I didn't know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out,” they said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. “They didn't incite panic. It was fairly orderly.”
Video from above the “Crossroads of the World” showed lines of police and emergency vehicles, their lights flashing, lining the streets and no other vehicle traffic moving.
Everything around the Port Authority area was shut down — a surreal scene of still at what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour.
New Jersey Transit buses headed to the Port Authority were diverting to other locations. NJ Transit said buses were taking passengers to Secaucus and Hoboken, where they could take trains into the city.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the explosion.

Amongst many designers and their firsts on the arduous schedule of Lakmé Fashion Week, is the return of Manish Arora to this runway after six years. The designer's decade in Paris was an illustrious one—from shocking the world with their unique technicolor vision to helming Paco Rabanne. As much of an icon globally as they are known in the homeland for their body of work, Arora's return to Lakmé Fashion Week is a cause of celebration.
“Paris inspires you, it accepts you as an individual and in that way Paris has influenced my work,” says the designer on theirs to the airport as we chant over the phone. “But the most important thing of all is that it teaches is you where to stop. There is a fine line between making a statement and going over the top,” they say. In the case of Arora, whose avant-garde clothing is the kind to stop traffic, restraint was perhaps the most important learning of their experience in the French capital.
Of course, restraint is a matter of relativity when talking about Arora. Their collection ‘Cosmic Love' boasts of celestial bodies, embellishments, optical illusions, Atzec prints and embellishments. “It's still the Manish Arora girl, but they have grown up now. They haven't lost their sense of humour but they are mature.” they describe the vibe of the line. “We try to do something new with denim each time, as we have this season too. The collection is detailed, it is more believable,” Arora tells us before rushing off to check in.
Manish Arora show in collaborations with Etihad Airways for fall/winter 2017 will take place at Lakmé Fashion Week on August 19, 2017

SAN FRANCISCO — A drone light show could be the future Fourth of July entertainment in wildfire-prone northern California — but not this year. Hundreds of drones, set to wow viewers with a patriotic display of flashing lights in the sky, were grounded Wednesday by windy conditions.
Intel's "Shooting Star Drones," which you may have seen at the Winter Olympics, Coachella or Lady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime show in 2017, were set to perform Wednesday at Travis Air Force Base, north of San Francisco, but the show was postponed until July 5th, at 9pm, pending weather conditions.
The Travis Air Force Base show plans to use 500 drones and feature a gigantic red, white and blue image of an American flag and California icons, all synchronized to music that will be broadcast for the viewers.
Intel drones can fly in up to 18 mile per hour winds, but winds are expected to be 30 miles per hour in the area at Wednesday's planned flight time, the company said.
Travis Air Force Base is just an hour south of Yolo and Napa County wildfires that forced evacuations this week.
Drone shows could be a safer alternative to fireworks in the future, and fire officials in California are happy to see the shift toward drones.
From a fire safety perspective, it's "definitely worth it to use a drone over live fireworks,” said Lynne Tolmachoff, chief of public education for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CalFire.
Several drought-prone cities in the West turned to drones this Fourth of July when city officials said fireworks wouldn't be allowed due to fire danger.
A couple Fourth of July drone shows at Civana Carefree in Arizona weren't affected by wind and were still a go, said Rianna Riego, the chief brand and wellness officer there. That event will be put on by Firefly Drone Shows, a Detroit-based company.
You can watch those shows via live stream on Civana's Facebook page, Riego said.

The FTSE 100's dividend yield of 4% is towards the upper end of its historic range. This means that it could offer an impressive income return for the long run, and that the indiex may also be undervalued at the present time. However, with inflation already standing at 3% and forecast to move higher, a 4% dividend yield may not remain a real-terms income return in the medium term. Therefore, buying these two investment trusts with higher dividend yields than the FTSE 100 could be a shrewd move.

However, with inflation already standing at 3% and forecast to move higher, a 4% dividend yield may not remain a real-terms income return in the medium term. Therefore, buying these two investment trusts with higher dividend yields than the FTSE 100 could be a shrewd move.
Positive outlook
Reporting on Monday was Midlands-focused property Group Real Estate investors (LSE: RLE). The REIT announced the sale of 24 Bennetts Hill in Birmingham for a cash consideration of £4m. This is a premium to book value and represents a 5.9% net initial yield. It also means the business has almost doubled its money versus the £2.06m it paid for it in December 2014.
In addition, Real Estate Investors has also completed the letting of Peat House in Leicester. The building is fully occupied and produces a rental income in excess of £0.5m per year. This has contributed to a record occupancy across the company's portfolio of 95%, which suggests that it could enjoy continued strong momentum in future.
With a dividend yield of 5.1%, the company looks set to offer a real income return in the long run. Furthermore, its bottom line is expected to increase by 14% next year and this is due to prompt a rise in dividends of around 7%. This means that not only does it have an above-inflation dividend yield, its shareholder payouts could rise at a much higher rate than inflation in future years. As such, now could be the perfect time to buy a slice of the business.
Upbeat outlook
Also offering an impressive outlook is fellow REIT Hansteen (LSE: HSTN). The company's asset base appears to be strong after several changes have been made, with its profitability due to rise by around 20% next year. This suggests that the performance of its end markets could continue to be strong, albeit with some uncertainty being present.
A double-digit rise in earnings is expected to prompt a rise in dividends of 6.3% in the 2018 financial year. This puts the company on a forward dividend yield of 4.7%. Beyond next year, there could be scope for a further rise, as the company appears to have a sound strategy which is benefitting from continued strong demand for rental space.
As well as this, Hansteen could deliver a rising share price. Its dividend yield suggests that it may offer good value for money, while a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.9 may do likewise. Therefore, although the UK economy may face an uncertain future due in part to Brexit and the potential challenges it may bring, now could be the right time to buy a REIT such as Hansteen for the long term.
London: Britain's Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron announced their resignation on Wednesday, citing scrutiny of their religious views over gay rights during the recent general election campaign.
"To be a political leader... and to live as a committed Christian, to hold faithfully to the Bible's teaching, has felt impossible for me," they said.
Farron, 47, said they had felt "torn" between political and religious life after facing questioning over whether they agreed with their party's positive view of same-sex unions.
A father of four, Farron was elected leader of the Liberal Democrats in July 2015 after the party, which had been in a coalition with the ruling Conservatives, was nearly wiped out in the general election, losing 48 seats.
However, the party created a surprise in last week's snap election, increasing their number of MPs from nine to 12, after campaigning for a second referendum on the terms of Brexit.
But Farron's stance on gay rights grabbed headlines very early on the campaign and they were asked to clarify whether they thought being gay was a sin after a 2015 interview resurfaced in which they had given an evasive answer.
"At the start of this election, I found myself under scrutiny again; asked about matters to do with my faith. I felt guilty that this focus was distracting attention from our campaign, obscuring our message," they said on Wednesday. "I seem to be the subject of suspicion because of what I believe and who my faith is in," they added.
Voting records show that Farron, an evangelical Christian, voted to allow registrars not to carry out gay marriages if they object on religious grounds.
They also voted against the Equality Act Regulations, which criminalised many types of discrimination against gay people back in 2007, opposing their party's official stance.
Former business secretary Vince Cable, Ed Davey, a former energy and climate change secretary and Jo Swinson, are the favourites to replace him.
A number of people are believed to have been injured following an incident at a military training base in West Wales.
A spokesperson for the MoD said it was aware of the incident at Castlemartin Ranges in Pembrokeshire.
A firing notice for Castlemartin on the Government's website suggests live firing was due to take place on the range from Monday to Friday.
The notice said the road from Bosherston to St Govan's Chapel and the footpath from St Govan's Head to Broadhaven would be closed every day.
It adds that night firing was due to take place on Tuesday and Thursday.
The MoD spokesperson added: "We are aware of an incident at Castlemartin Ranges. This is still being investigated and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further."
According to the Visit Pembrokeshire website, a large part of the Castlemartin peninsula was taken over by the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) tank range in the late 1930s and further developed during the Cold War period.
It is now the only UK Army range available for armoured units for direct-fire live gunnery exercises.
A spokesperson for Dyfed-Powys Police said: "Dyfed-Powys Police were called to an incident at MoD Royal Armoured Corps range in Castlemartin range at 3.30pm today.
"This is being investigated and a further update will be provided when appropriate."
A 21-year-old soldier died at Castlemartin in 2012 after being shot in the head while relaxing at a safe location just outside the training range.
A 2013 inquest into the death of Michael "Mike" Maguire heard they were hit in the temple by a single machine gun bullet fired by a fellow soldier during a training exercise and that the fatal bullet was fired one kilometre (0.6 miles) away inland towards another group of recruits on a live fire exercise.
All live fire should have been safely aimed out to sea, the inquest heard.
The inquest jury ruled Ranger Maguire, who was a member of the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, had been unlawfully killed.

PARIS: French technology consulting firm Atos offered to buy Gemalto for 4.3 billion euros (US$5.06 billion) on Monday to boost its cybersecurity services as states and big corporations seek to cope with a growing number of attacks on the Internet worldwide.
The bid comes as Gemalto, the world's largest maker of chips found in mobile phones and credit cards, is under pressure after posting four profit warnings in a year and having missed a chance to strengthen its security business through a large acquisition.
The combination would strengthen Atos in the burgeoning so-called Internet of Things (IoT) sector of internet-connected machinery and household devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors and European payment services on top of digital security, it said.
Atos said it delivered an offer to Gemalto's board on Nov. 28.
Shortly after issuing the formal offer, Atos Chief Executive Thierry Breton said they had already received the backing of Gemalto's biggest shareholder, France's state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.
"I've met the main shareholders and Bpi in particular," Breton said in a call with reporters following the announcement of the unsolicited bid for Gemalto.

"Bpi is not only favorable to this operation of European consolidation, but it also authorized me to tell you about it," they added.
Bpifrance holds 8.51 percent of Gemalto's shares, according to the group's last annual report. Gemalto and Bpifrance were not immediately reachable for comment.
STOCK PRESSURED
Gemalto had to postpone to March 2018 the presentation of its next multiyear strategic plan, after several profit warnings notably caused by slowing demand for credit card chips.

The group's shares have shed 38 percent so far this year compared with an increase of 24 percent for Atos.
Since Breton took the helm of Atos in November 2008, the firm has multiplied its stock price by close to six times, outperforming French rival Capgemini and U.S. companies Accenture and IBM.
Atos' revenue has more than doubled over the period to reach 11.7 billion euros in 2016, after having bought assets from Germany's Siemens, U.S. group Xerox and France-based computer company Bull.
Gemalto had sales of 3.2 billion euros in 2016.
The all-cash bid reflects a price of 46 euros per Gemalto share, representing a 42 percent premium on the group's last closing price, Atos said in a statement.
The bid would be financed by Atos' existing cash resources and debt, the company said without elaborating.
Breton said that two banks had already given their approval for a potential loan.

HOLLAND, Mich. (WOOD) — The West Ottawa football team finally got over the hump.
The Panthers accomplished something Friday night that hadn't been done in 15 years: They defeated O-K Red Conference rival Rockford.
West Ottawa overcame a 16-point halftime deficit and beat the Rams 35-30 on homecoming night.
>>Inside woodtv.com: Oct. 6 Football Frenzy
“The guys haven't beaten Rockford in a while, so just the way they competed and the way they've been preparing, I'm really proud of their effort,” Panthers coach Ryan Oshnock said. “They wanted this one probably a little more than any other game and they just played so hard.”
West Ottawa last beat Rockford in 2002 and it appeared that trend would continue after falling behind 23-7 at the half.
However, the Panthers opened the second half with a bang as SeanKeese Townsend returned the kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown to jumpstart the rally.
“I knew we needed to gain some momentum,” Townsend said. “And that was my plan coming out of halftime.”
“That springboarded us,” Oshnock added. “We said we can't score a 16-point play so let's take it one play at a time. SeanKeese just did a fantastic job of staying inbounds on that and took it to the house.
“It was a one-play mentality, like chopping down a tree. It's not going to come in one swing so let's put a bunch of plays together.”
The Panthers continued to chip away at the deficit and then took the lead by scoring 28 unanswered points.
Quarterback Isaac Van Dyke hooked up with Xavier Wade for a 25-yard touchdown, and then Van Dyke plowed in from three yards out to give West Ottawa a 28-23 advantage.
Van Dyke found Blake Bosma alone in the end zone in the fourth quarter and it was 35-23.
“We just wanted to get a good team victory and we did that,” Van Dyke said. “We came out strong in the second half and we just battled all the way.”
A 69-yard pass play from quarterback Drew Bareno to Kip Cushman with six minutes remaining gave Rockford hope, but its comeback hopes were dashed in the final seconds after an interception by Liam Cavanaugh.
“They made plays when it came down to it,” Oshnock said. “We tried to put it on the defense's back and they did a good job. This one is big for the team and it's big for the community.”

With the victory, West Ottawa (6-1) also clinched a share of its first O-K Red championship since 2005 and qualified for the state playoffs.
“We think it's one of the best conferences in the state of Michigan so to say that we've at least clinched a share, we're really excited about that,” Oshnock said. “And then you get into the playoffs and it means you get to play an extra week of football.”
Maliq Thompson had a pair of first-half touchdowns for Rockford, which fell to 4-3 overall.

A premier hospital in Bihar's capital Patna has called male candidates as well for the next round of recruitment process against vacancies reserved for female candidates only.This has outraged other eligible male candidates who are now accusing Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) of foul play and malpractice in the recruitment process. An employee of the Hospital, on the condition of anonymity, alleged irregularities in the earlier recruitment as well.News18 has the copy of the scrutinised list of candidates who have been called for the next round of examination on July 8.In March this year IGIMS invited applications for various posts, including that of Radiology technician. As per the advertisement all three posts were reserved for female candidates, one each from Unreserved (UR), Extremely Backward Class (EBC) and Scheduled Class category.On June 18, a list of 33 candidates was uploaded on the website of the hospital who were selected for the next round of examination. It also contained the names of five male applicants which shocked other eligible male candidates who found themselves deprived of the opportunity as they chose not to apply considering the advertisement clearly invited applications from female candidates only.Reacting to the news, IGIMS superintendent Manish Mandal said, “Central government rule allows considering applications received from male candidates if no one had applied from the reserved category.”When asked why it was not mentioned in the advertisement, they said, “It should have been done.” Quoting Examination Controller Rajesh Yadav, they said, “We did not invite applications from male candidates. But when such applications were received, we conferred the rule book which says other candidates can be considered if no one has applied from the category for which the posts are reserved.”He had no answer when asked in which reserved category the administration did not receive any application from female candidates.Moreover a source in the IGIMS administration refuted their claims and said the list itself consisted female candidates from all three categories (UR, EBC & SC).Dinesh Kumar, studying MSc in radiology from a Ghaziabad college, told News18 that they along with hundreds of other candidates met the criteria but did not apply simply because these posts were reserved for female candidates.Alleging foul play, they said, “Even many eligible candidates who completed their course from IGIMS itself did not apply. This raises suspicion on the whole recruitment process.”

The Dickies' Stan Lee, left, and Leonard Graves Phillips Svenja Block
[Editor's note: Back in June, a fan-shot video circulated showing Dickies frontman Leonard Graves Phillips appearing to berate a female fan, reportedly for heckling and holding up a sign during the band's set at Warped Tour that called them "disgusting old men" and accused them of predatory behavior. L.A. Weekly writer Lina Lecaro wrote an op-ed piece weighing in on the controversy, published on July 6. Recently, Phillips responded to their story with the below letter. With their permission, we are reprinting it in full. All typographical marks are Phillips'.]
Dear Lina Lecaro,
As lead singer of The D&*^ies for the past 40 years, I've never had to counter false and slanderous accusations from a protestor who was shrieking that I was a "child predator" amidst the crowd of fans. So when that b*g, bovine, adult wom&n (NOT child or teenager as has been commonly mis-reported) called me a *%^&$% *!, I couldn't take anymore and I called them a v&ry b*d w^rd in reply. I apologize to the public for the ugly vitriol I shot back at one adult woman (and not at all womankind).
My tirade wasn't in response to the Parental Advisory representative simply standing there holding a sign as you reported. I reacted to the vicious, unending, slanderous garbage-pile of words heaped upon me by that beastly ... LARGE ADULT CREATURE who was interrupting my work and ruining the fans' enjoyment of my show. I reacted (regrettably) in terrible anger — not at being "heckled" but at being falsely, publicly accused of sexually preying upon children. I didn't take kindly to being called a pedophile. Would you?
The Dickies have played the Warped Tour several times and there's never been a problem until "Safer Scenes" (SS) came along as the tour's very own thought police. After a spate of REAL child abuse allegations at Warped, the SS sprang into action. Dipping into their crowd-funded pile of loot, they purchased a dry-erase board with intent to protest and silence A SATIRICAL SHOW that involves apish antics, cartoon songs and some adorable puppets, if I do say so myself (*blush*). We've played all-ages crowds for decades and there has never been a hint of impropriety with a minor during The Dickies' entire 40-year career.
If a total rewrite of my comedic act would prevent the sexual abuse of even one child, I'd sign up for re-education camp in a heartbeat. I WISH I was "The Man" who had that kind of power. (I'd like to have their wallet, too.) But I'm merely an internationally acclaimed cabaret performer so the SS push for artistic censorship remains only that and nothing more. I — and many thousands who have voiced their support — view the lock-step mentality and actions of Safer Scenes to be far more disturbing than angry words shouted by The Man wearing a p&^!s puppet.
Yours truly,
Leonard Graves Phillips
KATHMANDU: Dr Govinda KC spent 22 days lying on a gurney in a hospital in Nepal's capital Kathmandu, but they were not a patient. The orthopaedic surgeon was on hunger strike.
Dr KC has gone on hunger strike 10 times over the past four years in an attempt to pressure the government to improve healthcare in the impoverished Himalayan nation -- and they are sure they will have to strike again.
"The hospitals and medical institutions, they don't have proper infrastructure. They don't have adequate manpower, adequate equipment," said Dr KC from a hospital bed where they are recovering from their latest fast.
Nepal - a country of 28 million people - has only seven doctors, nurses and midwives, and 50 hospital beds, for every 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
The WHO recommends at least 34.5 skilled healthcare professionals per 10,000 people.

The limited health sector was further strained after the devastating 2015 earthquake, which damaged nearly a third of public clinics and hospitals.
More than 80 per cent of the population live in rural areas, reliant on rudimentary state-run clinics, while hospitals are concentrated in cities - and are mostly private.
"Private health care is linked to higher out-of-pocket payments, which leads to more people being impoverished as a result of health care," said Jos Vandelaer, country director for the WHO in Nepal.
Health Minister Gagan Thapa said that while Nepal has made improvements, reducing child and maternal mortality, healthcare remained limited - and expensive.
"You have one liver problem and you are back into poverty," they said.
Something of a medical Robin Hood, Dr KC, 60, is well known in Nepal for their philanthropic work, travelling to some of the country's most remote communities to provide medical care and train local health workers.
They live in doctors' quarters at the back of the hospitals where they work and spends less than a third of their salary on himself, using most of it to buy drugs and basic equipment for their clinics. Their only luxury is a 20-year-old television.
They have travelled alone to help out in disaster zones around the world, offering their services to local hospitals in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake and the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan.
BROKEN PROMISES
Nepal has been plagued by political instability since it transformed from a Hindu monarchy to a federal state in 2008, two years after the end of the bloody decade-long Maoist insurgency.
The revolving door politics has seen competing parties seek to retain influence by stacking loyalists within the bureaucratic structures -- including in the health sector.
A new constitution agreed last year included a pledge for universal healthcare, but the charter is yet to be implemented.
Private hospitals and medical colleges have mushroomed, filling a hole left by the limited government-run health sector, and often owned by the politically well-connected.
"It is supposed to be a service-orientated sector, but it has turned to be [a] profit making sector for the political parties, for the politicians themselves," said Dr KC.

Top of Dr KC's demands is an end to the political meddling that they say is putting business interests ahead of developing public health services.
Training is particularly contentious, dominated by fee-based medical schools which critics say lack basic facilities and enrol too many students each year.
"There is no commercialisation of the medical education sector in the big developed countries, whereas in our country it is so rampantly commercialised," said Dr KC, who trained in Bangladesh with residencies in Britain and Switzerland.
Health minister Thapa said at least six members of the government's advisory health committee, which has consistently blocked the passing of a medical education bill to regulate doctor training, had links to private medical colleges.
The bill was one of the main demands Dr KC made in their latest strike, their longest yet, which ended in early December after they reached an agreement with the government.
But the surgeon and their supporters have little confidence things will change quickly.
"This is the tenth time that Dr Govinda KC has been in hunger strike, that means there has been nine times the agreement has been broken," said Dr Lijan Maharjan, part of their negotiating team.
Lying on a hospital bed, a woollen hat pulled down low against the cold, Dr KC appeared resigned to another strike.
"They won't let it happen if I don't," they said.

Things that we do on a regular basis soon become second nature to us. But what if you found out that you were performing an everyday task completely incorrectly? Like carrying a car seat, for example. A doctor in Texas has revealed that the way people lug around these pieces of kit could actually be detrimental to their health.
Looking after a baby or a small child is tough. When you're responsible for a little one's wellbeing, it can often feel like there are a million things to remember. Even the simplest of tasks can become complicated when you're caring for someone who can't tell you what they need.

So, how do you know if you're getting it right? It can help to ask friends and family for guidance, but in some cases you may not even know that you need advice until it is offered. And the way you hold a car seat could be one of those cases. Happily, though, help is now at hand for parents everywhere.

California's organics-loving, go-green mentality is what makes the state a hub for environmental progress, but in the case of the cannabis industry, some say it could be its downfall. Pesticide regulations released earlier this year by the California Bureau of Medical Cannabis are some of the strictest requirements in the country — possibly the strictest — and have left both cultivators and testing laboratories reeling.
“They will be exceptionally difficult if not virtually impossible [to meet],” said Dr. Jeffrey Raber, chief executive of the Werc Shop, a cannabis research and testing facility in Monrovia.
Pesticides are an integral part of both the indoor and outdoor agricultural industry, and are used to help fend off or kill mites, bugs, diseases or other threats to a plant's integrity. They're also poison, and most industry members agree pesticides need to be regulated in a manner comparable to other agricultural products we consume. In fact, marijuana faces additional scrutiny because it is also a form of medicine, and some consumers who use it suffer from compromised immune systems.
However, California's current “residual tolerance requirements” — basically, how much of certain pesticides is allowed to remain on cannabis products when they're ready to hit the market — may pose problems on the production line. For one, the microscopic amounts that labs will be testing — either on a part per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb) basis — require extremely expensive equipment that's difficult to maintain and that many facilities will have to specially purchase, Raber said. It's like investing in a house, they said, and can cost upward of $500,000.
This could not only prove prohibitive for testing facilities but also result in a laboratory bottleneck as producers across the state flock to get products tested in accordance with California law.
One of the most contentious chemicals on California's list is Myclobutanil, a fungicide commonly used on almonds, berries and grapes in the state. For these foods, Myclobutanil is limited to .025 parts per million, Raber said, while for cannabis edibles, it's currently limited to .02 parts per million. Based on their lab's calculations — which take into account how much an average consumer weighs and how much weed they'd be consuming per day — the conservative limit for cannabis should actually be closer to 1.5 parts per million.
In short, people consume less cannabis, so the acceptable pesticide rates can be higher.
“You're going to eat a whole lot more apples and grapes than you are cannabis,” they said.
California's draft pesticide regulations would make the state one of the strictest to legalize cannabis so far. L.A. Weekly
Acceptable pesticide levels vary depending on if the product is cannabis flower, an edible or another type of processed cannabis, and Raber said that distinguishing based on method of intake makes sense. When one eats weed, it's metabolized and filtered by the liver, and there's already an existing body of research on how pesticides are processed in oral consumption, they said. When weed is smoked, however, it goes straight into the bloodstream. In addition, there's no prior body of research on the topic, so it's appropriate that regulators exercise caution with requirements for cannabis flowers.
The draft regulations also may be difficult for cultivators to meet, especially because up until this time, most had little to no guidance on what types of pesticides to use or at what point of the growing process they should be applied, Raber said. There is the added complication that Myclobutanil (among others) can spread through groundwater and rainwater, and show up in the product of a grower who hasn't even used that pesticide.
“Pesticide testing makes up a very small percentage of the number of tests we do because it's expensive and no one's requiring it yet,” said Josh Wurzer, president and lab director of SC Laboratories Inc., a cannabis testing facility in Santa Ana.
Of the cannabis products SC Labs has tested, in which it screened for the 12 most common pesticides, about 77 percent of cannabis concentrates would fail California's proposed regulations by a landslide, Wurzer said. The findings of a NBC investigation released earlier this year echo this conclusion. In a review of 44 weed samples obtained from 15 dispensaries throughout Southern California, a lab found that 93 percent of them tested positive for pesticides, at high enough levels that they would have been banned from states that currently regulate pesticides in cannabis.
California's regulations were determined in large part by recommendations made by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, which oversees the sale and use of pesticides in an effort to protect human health and the environment. Toxicologists used research data provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as well as existing regulations from other states, to try to pinpoint quantities of pesticides safe for use.
“We welcome these tight regulations on pesticides,” said Ryan Jennemann, manager of sustainability-focused THC Design, a cultivator based in Los Angeles.

For producers like Jennemann — whose pest-management program is 100 percent organic and consists of only natural bacterias and beneficial fungi — these proposed requirements only serve to further distinguish them from the pesticide-using pack. The draft requirements are a lot stricter than anticipated, Jennemann said, but they're also direly needed, as independent studies have shown widespread use of hormones and chemicals in California's cannabis.
“You can see how almost nobody in the industry is growing a safe product,” they said. “I have been in zero grows over 4,000 [or] 5,000 square feet that I haven't seen banned substances.”
As for the hotly disputed Myclobutanil, Jennemann said, growers shouldn't be using it in the first place. (Although the drug is classified as having "low acute toxicity," workers exposed to it have reported everything from nausea and eye irritation to abdominal pain and vomiting, and studies in rats show it could have long-term effects on reproductive systems.)
But even Jennemann isn't totally satisfied with the proposed regulations. For one, when testing is regulated on the parts-per-billion level, it can detect pesticides that were present in the product not just weeks but months before production. This can pose a huge issue for even the greenest of companies, since they often buy genetics or do collaborations with other growers and can as a result be penalized for a poison that was never applied by them.
With a Jan. 1 rollout looming, Alex Traverso, chief of communications at the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, said that these testing requirements are not set in stone. The state is withdrawing the proposed medical regulations and reworking guidelines that combine both medical and adult-use industries, as dictated by SB 94. While California will certainly have some of the “more stringent testing standards of any state that's legalized thus far,” Traverso said they're trying to protect consumers while minimizing financial burden on producers.
“All along we recognize that the overall goal here in terms of legalizing and regulating the industry is to do as much as you can to eliminate the black market, and you don't do that if you make things cost-prohibitive,” they said.

yORK CITY manager Gary Mills saw their side put back under pressure by their former club Wrexham, who ended their worst winless run for seven years.
An early Jon Parkin strike for York City was cancelled out by Dan Parslow's own goal, before second-half efforts by Jordan White and Leo Smith secured the visitors' first win in eight games.
York took the lead on two minutes with 35-year-old veteran Parkin's 16th goal of the season, squeezing a low attempt past Shwan Jalal from eight yards.
Wrexham were level, though, on the half-hour mark when the hosts failed to deal with Anthony Barry's right-wing cross and, after Scott Loach saved White's close-range effort, the ball bounced back into the net off the on-loan goalkeeper's team-mate Parslow.
After the break, home captain Simon Heslop side-footed wastefully over from 10 yards before the visitors forged ahead when a failure to deal with James Jennings's cross from the left saw White volley in from eight yards out at the far post.
In response, Vadaine Oliver volleyed wide for the Minstermen and Amari Morgan-Smith's shot was smothered.
The visitors made the points certain when Smith guided an eight yard chance into the bottom-left corner.

MOSCOW: Friday's World Cup quarter-final against Brazil in Kazan is a defining game for Belgium's talented generation of players but don't call them 'golden', said defender Vincent Kompany on Wednesday.
"The term 'golden generation' is obviously one the players didn't come up with and it's not something we pay too much importance to," they told a news conference at Belgium's training base outside Moscow.

"The fact that the game against Brazil is defining for our generation is for sure, though. It's not like we've been failing up to now but there is a level above, which we need to achieve, which can be done by a game like the one we are playing against Brazil.
"So, it's a defining game, but not just for us, it's a defining game for Brazil as well. The players that they have … both teams deserve to be facing each other a little further in, in this tournament and not in the quarter-final."
For years, much has been expected of a crop of players, which Kompany previously captained, including Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Thibault Courtois and Dries Mertens but Belgium have so far not delivered on their promise, going out in the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup and at the European Championships in France two years ago.
But Kompany said they were mentally tougher, mostly because squad members had been winning at club level around Europe.

"It used to be in Belgian culture, and I think everyone would agree with me, we would feel defeated even before a game like this but all these players in our team, who play at clubs around the world, now believe 100 percent we can beat Brazil. Whether that's realistic I don't know, Brazil is an incredible team but there is not one day I go to bed thinking 'what if we lose'?"
Asked what they would do if Neymar repeated their much-criticised theatrics from Monday's Round of 16 win over Mexico, where they rolled around in apparent agony on the field after clashes with the opposition, Kompany said: "I don't know. I don't care. If it's going to be a game of individual performances and just that, then let me tell you right now we have no chance against Brazil.
"But if it's going to be a collective performance from a smart team that knows how to play together and fight for each other, then we have a chance and that's the only thing I care about.
"Whatever any player on the other team does will not matter much," added polyglot Kompany, who answered questions in four different languages during their half-hour press conference.

The lack of a U.S. team caused a big viewership drop for World Cup telecasts.
The 48 group stage telecasts on Fox and FS1 averaged 2,069,000 viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. That is down 42 per cent from the 3.54 million average on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC four years ago and down 15 per cent from the 2,429,000 average on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC eight years ago.
Excluding games involving the U.S. team in previous World Cups, the average declined 28 per cent from the 2014 tournament in Brazil and was up 1 per cent from the 2010 tournament in South Africa.

The Uttar Pradesh SC/ST Commission has issued a notice to Aligarh Muslim University for not following quota rules. The chairperson of UP SC/ST Commission and former DGP Brij Lal claimed that AMU has failed to discharge its constitutional obligations in relation to reservation.The commission has sent a notice to the vice-chancellor of AMU and sought a reply by August 8. Brij Lal said, “Summons will be issued if the answer is not given within stipulated timeframe. The decision was taken after more than a dozen complaints were received.”While placing the AMU administration in the dock, Brij Lal said that by not giving reservation, thousands of children have been deprived of good education by AMU.On Tuesday, the Chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and Agra MP Ram Shankar Katheria met the authorities to discuss the issue. The move came after Aligarh MP Satish Gautam wrote a letter to AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor on Monday, stating that the university should provide reservation to SC/ST candidates till the matter is decided by the apex court.Katheria had said, “I have asked the university to produce documents or legal proof to support their claim of being a minority institution. They have one month to prove the same. In case they fail to do so, they should implement reservation or the government should stop thegrant.”“If they are not a minority institution and are still not implementing the reservation for SC/ST candidates, then the government should not give them grants. The issue here is not about grants, but more about implementation of reservation,” added Katheria, while stating that in a week's time, the NCSC will become party to the case of the university's minority status, which is pending before the Supreme Court.
Shalini has been waiting for their husband with their breastfed baby for the past 13 days in the seaside Kerala's Poonthura village with their eyes fixed on the rising waves.
They sit in a tent, the villagers raised on the beach before a local church, along with scores of other women who do not know when their men who ventured into the sea on 29 November would return.
From the Poonthura village alone, 29 fishers who went in small boats mostly with portable outboard engines had left before Cyclone Ockhi swept through the Arabian Sea last month end.
Hundreds of people had gone into the sea in mechanised vessels and reached Lakshadweep islands and southwestern states of Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra.
They started coming back within a few days with the help of the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard which launched a joint search and rescue mission, Op Sahayam, the very next day Cyclone Ockhi hit the Arabian Sea.
The chances of survival for fishers who are still at sea with small boats, including catamarans, 95 officially, after retrieving 42 bodies, are too little.
"These people are really a cause for concern," said former chief minister Oommen Chandy, who has been regularly going to these villages consoling the grieving families.
"Those who had gone in large mechanised boats would have reached shores elsewhere, and they have started coming back, much to the relief of these families,” they added.
But Shalini, 25, wife of Paniyadima Moses, 37, and others have not lost their hopes. They continue their wait under the scorching sun for the second week, surviving on the food aid workers provide.
"She does not eat, and they look numbed. They have to feed their baby who is just eight months old," a woman sitting adjacent to them tells Firstpost. "
Besides the toddler Prashant, who refuses to leave their lap, their four-year-old son Prathul is also with their mother in their unending wait for their breadwinner.
They cannot lose the fight. Moses left them after clasping the baby to their chest and planting a tender kiss on its cheek one last time on that fateful Wednesday afternoon.
They were a group of ten fishers in two boats, and they were to return early morning with the night's catch before the auction begins on the beach.
The boats caught in the cyclone and capsized. Only two of the fishers could swim into safety. The fate of others remains unknown.
Shalini is a school dropout, and the family was living in a rented house. A bleak future stares at them.
Like most others in the impoverished coastal fishing hamlets, Moses has had no savings and insurance against accident or death. The family does not even have a ration card.
Similar is the case with almost all of them. Clinical psychologists who visit their homes and give them counselling say many face post-traumatic stress syndrome.
Some have even developed a fear of the sea. Heartrending cries receive every visitor, whether it is an aid worker, lawmaker or a journalist.
Thades Mary, 30, has three school going children all in primary classes. If their husband Paniyadima Francis fails to return by Thursday and pay up, they will have to vacate their rented house as the rent is due for two months.
"We have been sharing a house with another family. Now, I have no place to go and live with my husband being at sea," they tell Firstpost.
Selin, 32, has four girl children, the eldest being seven and the youngest just turned a year old. Them husband, Kumar, 38, also has a paralysed father and an acute diabetic mother, both requiring money to get properly treated.
The family had a hand-to-mouth existence. All of them have no land or house of their own, despite the fact that the state launched a zero-landless and housing for all schemes launched four years ago.
The victims belong to the Latin Catholic archdiocese in Kerala, which observed a day of prayers for the dead and the missing on Sunday. They say both the state and central governments have left them in the lurch.
On Monday, hundreds of people from the fishing community marched on the streets of the state capital to Raj Bhavan registering their protest against “inadequate response” to the devastation. They want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit them and see their plight for themselves and order a coordinated search operation to trace the missing men.
Congress president-elect Rahul Gandhi is visiting some of these villages on Thursday.
The government has announced an ex gratia of Rs 20 lakh for the dead and offered employment for the next of kin, but very few are qualified for a government job. The children have stopped going to school since the tragedy struck.
The state has also offered a sustenance allowance of Rs 60 a day for an adult and Rs 45 for a child. But no government official is seen around, and many have no idea what it was meant for. The government officials say they have set up camps, and those who need support are being shifted there. The government also bears the treatment expenses of the survivors.
The cabinet meeting on Wednesday will review the situation and decide further relief measures.
“I can understand the frustration and anger of the suffering people whose breadwinners are away at sea,” said E Chandrasekharan, the state's minister for revenue and disaster management.
“We are doing everything humanly possible to alleviate their sufferings and reach the aid that the cabinet has cleared. We have also decided to compensate for their lost boats and nets and provide their children with free education,” they added.
The aid workers say, in private, that there's little or no chance for the bodies to be recovered after so many days. They would end up on the list of the missing persons, making it difficult for the families to get the compensation.
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had sought a Rs 1,843 crore financial package from the central government for the “rehabilitation and resettlement” of the affected.
“What we need is not such big promises but action on the ground at this hour of crisis,” says Maglin Philomena, who leads the women's wing of the National Fishworkers Forum (NFF).
“We had heard such promises when tsunami took away more than 100 lives among us in 2004. Then they spent all the money on roads and bridges away from the coasts. It contained no substantial schemes for the suffering hundreds,” they inform.
The NFF on Sunday issued a statement saying the state government was exploiting the tragedy to elicit central funds.
“The cash-strapped state is seeking funds for tourism and related activities in our name. They included roads and bridges to promote beach tourism,” they say.
The villagers have not been allowing state ministers, who initially ignored warnings and their call for help, to visit them. They even booed them off.
“Vijayan went there on the fourth day when defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman landed here. Remember, Poonthura is less than nine kilometres from their office,” says political commentator Roy Mathew.
“He has been busy with other engagements like attending wedding receptions. They went to visit the agitated fishers late in the evening on 3 December after attending the marriage of a liquor baron in the city. The next day, they found time to travel 20 kilometres along with their wife to condole a financier whose 93-year-old father died.”
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) says it had sent warnings to state governments against sending fishers into the sea four times on 29 November which Kerala ignored while the neighbouring Tamil Nadu state with a broader fishing community could reduce the casualties substantially.
Vijayan chairs the state's seven-member disaster management authority filled with ministers and bureaucrats except for a lone scientist. Naturally, the entire early warning system collapsed and hundreds of men were left at high seas.
“His engagements on the day when the entire state was in shock and disbelief included a meeting of editors to announce a farce called Loka Kerala Sabha where the state Assembly floors will roll out a red carpet to rich NRIs for a meeting,” says Mathew.
“Other affluent Christian churches have also turned a blind eye on their sufferings, which is equally painful,” they added.
The archdiocese of Latin has even threatened to lay a siege to the State Secretariat, where the offices of the chief minister and their cabinet are located, with dead bodies, if the apathy continued and the government fails to step in with a comprehensive rehabilitation plan.
“What I can see here is the government's contempt for these poor lives. They could not even bring back those who landed on shores elsewhere,” says Philomena.
“What we needed was not a package. What we needed was the return of our men. We are spending days and nights on the shores praying for their lives. We all believe all is not lost. We still have hope left.
“The fishing community is in a debt trap. But the government is busy writing off loans taken by fishing contractors. Why don't you have a list of those who had reached other states and those missing and dead.
“The state boasts of being the first to become open-defecation free, but many households have no toilets. Only a year ago, stray dogs mauled a 65-year-old lady on Pulluvila beach early morning while answering the call of nature,” they say.
The fishers have been making fervent appeals to take them aboard the rescue vessels as they know the sea better and where they could have gone fishing. But there was none to take their call, until Sitharaman met them on 4 December. But by that time, many were gone forever.
Instead of consoling the mothers, wives, and daughters, anxiously waiting on shores, Kadakampally Surendran, the minister Vijayan assigned to oversee relief operations, took a ride on a rescue chopper hampering it.
“It would have been a different story had they come early, listened to us and taken fishers who know every corner of the sea and their favourite fishing spots well,” Philomena said.
“The chief minister was holding that they kept away not to disrupt the search and rescue attempts. But there was nothing that prevented them as they were offshore and were operated by defence forces under the Southern Naval Command,” they added.
The fishing community in Kerala has been on the streets since the tragedy hit the state's coastal areas urging the authorities to act swiftly. Rail and road traffic were stalled for many hours last week as they squatted on the tracks and the national highway on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border.
“When people get stranded in the oil-rich Gulf, you send charter flights to evacuate them. But they won't do it for the poor fishers. We are sad at the attitude of the Union and state governments,” said Vicar General Fr Eugene Pereira.
“It's 12th day today, and the politicians are engaged in a blame game instead of trying to allay fears of these women and children. They are not getting the respect a human being deserves," they told Firstpost on Sunday.
The villagers accuse The Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard sailors engaged in the rescue operations are not picking up bodies of their loved ones floating in the sea off southern Kerala, which they have denied.
“I have seen bodies floating around, but they all have decayed beyond retrieval,” a fisher onboard a rescue aircraft was seen telling News 18 Kerala.
“Even the tsunami warning system that was installed a decade ago is not functional anymore, and none is bothered,” said another man. “There are 25 boats with the state's coastal police, but 15 of them are under repair.”
The State Human Rights Commission has also come out against officials for the delayed response and shoddy search and rescue operations with nearly 100 fishers still missing in Kerala.
“I don't want to blame any particular government, but there was criminal negligence on the part of officials when people were dying and their bodies floating around like the dead fish,” the commission chair P Mohan Das said at a public meeting on Sunday.
“It was a clear case of serious human rights violation, the denial of their right to live,” they added.
The commission, which visited the worst-hit coastal villages on Wednesday, had ordered the IMD and the state authorities to file sworn statements for not expediently communicating the severe cyclone warning.
“A timely storm alert would have saved hundreds,” they said. “The officialdom could not shrug off responsibility for the oversight that had plunged the families into the depth of despair and deprivation.”
Nine ships and all available aircraft with the southern naval command are engaged in search and rescue operations codenamed ‘OP Sahayam'.
Long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft P8I searched over entire Maldives after the fishing community estimated few vessels to be stranded on the islands. They got “expeditious clearance” through diplomatic channels to fly over the Maldives.
“Calls were given on very high frequency (VHF) radio,” it said in a statement on Sunday. The statement said that officials have also confirmed that the Maldivian locals undertook search and have not located any fishers on the islands.
INS Sujata equipped with mobile morgue boxes has taken four fishers and an official onboard for joining the deep sea search operations.
“The search is expected to continue up to the satisfaction of the fishers,” it said.
INS Subhadra, another naval vessel under routine deployment, identified twelve crew onboard two Tamil Nadu registered fishing vessels Milkyas and Felixia about 90 miles northwest of Bitra island of Lakshadweep. They also encountered two capsized fishing vessels — Annei and AVM EP Turai — but no survivors were found onboard.
The sailors have so far covered nearly half a million square miles.
Archbishop Soosai Pakiam, who heads the Latin Catholic Church of fishers, said they were not satisfied with the official response, and what is being witnessed is the spontaneous reaction of the aggrieved people.
“We had not called any agitation till Monday,” they said. “But if the apathy continues, we would be forced to go into direct action. People lose patience when their breadwinners fail to return even after so many days.”
Meanwhile, the Indian Coast Guard said they had retrieved four more unidentified bodies on Monday, from 100 and 150 nautical miles away from the shore. Another eight bodies are still lying in the morgue awaiting relatives for DNA matching.
“I think our identity in terms of being a discovery festival isn't something I'm going to alter. But I look forward to getting a little bit bigger,” they say.
The Los Angeles Film Festival , taking place June 14-22, has always been an adaptive beast, changing over the years as it chases the moving target of exactly what it means to be a film festival in the capital of the film industry. This year, the biggest change is at the top, as Jennifer Cochis takes over for Stephanie Allain as director. Previously creative director and senior programmer at LAFF, Cochis has produced a number of L.A.-centric features (“Smashed,” “Los Wild Ones”). And they look to continue and expand on much of the work of their predecessor, with the focus on spotlighting emerging directors and promoting a more inclusive view of the filmmaker community.
Though they offer the caveat “I love all our children,” Cochis calls particular attention to such films as Christian Papierniak's “Izzy Gets the Fuck Across Town” and Vincent Grashaw's “And Then I Go” in the narrative feature competition. They give a shout-out to Timothy McNeil's “Anything,” Sam Hoffman's “Humor Me,” and Lea Thompson's directorial debut, “The Year of Spectacular Men,” which are playing outside competition. Of the documentaries, they spotlight “Monkey Business,” an animated doc about the creators of “Curious George”; “Living on Soul,” about Daptone Records; and “Built to Fail: A Streetwear Story,” which explores the collector obsessions around L.A.'s sneaker and streetwear culture.
Opening with the world premiere of Colin Trevorrow's “ The Book of Henry ,” and featuring highlights including Sofia Coppola's “The Beguiled,” Hong Sangsoo's “On the Beach at Night Alone,” and a “Portlandia” retrospective, LAFF will unspool 48 features, of which 37 are world premieres.
“I wanted to expand the conversation,” they say. “We're really trying to incorporate the conversations that are happening on Twitter about these very topics, and then bringing them to the fore and actually giving them a platform.”
One of the first festivals to make filmmaker diversity a particular, explicit imperative, the fest this year boasts a slate of directors that is 42% female and 40% people of color. Furthermore, one of Cochis' earliest changes has been to expand the Diversity Speaks panel series from one day to two, with discussions scheduled on everything from cisgender actors taking on trans parts to the whitewashing of Asian roles.
Starting this year, each of the films on LAFF's slate will only play once. This policy is something Cochis had sought to implement last year, with the idea of turning each screening into an exclusive event.
“We're so culturally rich [in Los Angeles], that if you tell me I can attend your birthday party three different times over the course of a month, I'll probably try to come to the last one, and then I'll forget,” they say with a laugh. “So by making the priority screening a discovery screening, the hope I have is to generate excitement around it.”
Of course, this structure would seem to present something of a double-edged sword: With the festival overwhelmingly made up of first- or second-time filmmakers, there will be no way for festgoers to hear about a particular diamond in the rough and make a point to catch it later on.
Cochis counters that LAFF tried to accommodate late-comers to popular films last year with an encore screening series, but “as much as I was hoping they would help elevate those films or be very well attended, that wasn't always the case,” they say.
“For me as a filmmaker, one of the things you're chasing is your first screening. Because that screening tends to be full, and people tend to be engaged and ask thoughtful questions in the Q&A. You want that to happen throughout the rest of the festival, but I've had experiences at Toronto and Sundance and SXSW where you're at that fifth screening and there's like seven people, half of them walked out and no one asked questions. … So I'm trying to kind of crystallize that first screening experience that you're going to be chasing this for the rest of your festival tour.”
Getting Around
Appropriately for a film festival located in the commuter capital of America, LAFF has been a bit of a nomad. Previously headquartered right across from the Staples Center in downtown, and situated across the city in Westwood before that, the fest inaugurated a another location last year, centered around the ArcLight Cinemas in Culver City, with opening night held at the theater chain's Hollywood location.
For this year's iteration, the fest will actually continue to spread, but methodically so. While the fest nucleus will once again be Culver City, it will hold a number of screenings at the ArcLight in Santa Monica, with other key events at the L.A. County Museum of Art midcity, and the Ace Hotel downtown.
Cochis notes that with the Metro Gold Line expansion into Santa Monica, travel between Culver City and Santa Monica is particularly quick and easy. And the fest has reached out to more local businesses to be a part of the fest.
“I really want to connect it to a place, because I look at the festival as being in conversation with Los Angeles,” they say.
LONDON: Warren Gatland will reveal their British and Irish Lions squad for the daunting tour of New Zealand on Wednesday, when talk in rugby clubs across the region will quickly switch from who will be on the plane to who is likely to be in the test team.
Gatland, who oversaw the 2-1 series victory over Australia four years ago, is tipped to select Welsh flanker Sam Warburton as captain for the second time, an honour previously bestowed only on England's Martin Johnson.
Warburton captained the team in the first two tests against Australia in 2013 but missed the decisive third through injury, with fellow Welshman Alun Wyn Jones stepping in.
Jones has taken on the captaincy duties for Wales this season while Warburton has played superbly, adding to the conundrum for Gatland, who will return to their day job as Wales coach after the tour.
There will no doubt be the usual surprises - experienced Six Nations men missing out and the odd young "bolter" being given their chance. Media speculation over the weekend has already suggested that Joe Launchbury, George Ford and Jamie Joseph can start preparing for England's tour of Argentina instead.
The heart of the squad oozes quality, with flyhalves Jonathan Sexton and Owen Farrell, scrumhalf Conor Murray, winger George North and key forwards Billy Vunipola, Peter O'Mahony, Taulupe Faletau and Sean O'Brien on just about every pundit's short list.
Gatland also looks spoiled for choice at lock and in the back row, where some high-class operators will have to miss out.
On the other hand, other areas will have given them sleepless nights, with a group of similarly matched contenders of a good standard but who are unlikely to strike fear into New Zealand coach Steve Hansen.
Key among This is probably hooker, where the captains of the best two teams in Europe - England's Dylan Hartley and Ireland's Rory Best - will probably travel but with neither in the box seat - and Wales' impressive Ken Owens in with a shout.
For all those who make the squad, and however well they bed down in their short time together, they face a monumentally difficult task.
Many observers are describing this year's tour as the Lions' toughest, not just because of the supreme quality of the world champion All Blacks, but because of the strength too of the provincial teams and the desperately limited preparation time.
The Lions kick off with the only easy-looking fixture of the 10-match tour, against Provincial Barbarians on June 3.
That is just one week after the English Premiership and Pro-12 finals, and with Gatland having said previously that anyone featuring in those matches will not play in the tour opener, their opening options look squeezed.
Former England flyhalf Stuart Barnes, who toured New Zealand with the Lions in 1993 without playing a test, described this year's tour as "attempting to conquer rugby's Mount Everest without oxygen, with a storm gathering on the horizon.
"To win the series would be the greatest Lions triumph of all. To win more than 50 percent of their games will be a decent effort," they said, factoring in the tough tour games against the country's dominant Super Rugby sides.
The Lions have won only one series in New Zealand, in 1971, and since they started touring there in 1904 have won six of the 38 tests - with three draws.
They were hammered 3-0 on their last visit 12 years ago, when Dan Carter was in their pomp, but if Lions fans think the retirement of the superstar flyhalf will have weakened the All Blacks, they have not been watching Beauden Barrett, who is operating at arguably even higher levels this season.
His, and possibly New Zealand's only relative weakness is in goalkicking, where the Lions have real strength in depth, but the tourists are almost certainly going to need to find more than a few penalties to conquer that sporting Everest.

The Departments of Economic Opportunities and Social Development in the Western Cape have announced a ground-breaking women empowerment initiative. The announcement was made at Sisters Incorporated, one of the social development department's funded shelters for abused women.
In a study done by the World Health Organization, it was found that 60,000 women and children are victims of domestic violence in South Africa. It is hard to gather accurate statistical data in South Africa because domestic violence is rarely reported but these shelters will definitely be an opportunity for abused woman to restart their lives to a better one.
Western cape Minister of Economic Opportunities, Alan Winde said the programme would support a network of sixteen shelters for abused women.
“Women that are abused get relieved from society from all the pressures and they get hidden away in these shelters and then they need to rebuild their lives,” they said.
The initiative will provide skills, training and economic opportunities to 310 women currently with the Western Cape government's 16 funded shelters for abused women. A referral pathway will be developed through the DSD Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP).
Through this joint initiative, the Western Cape Government seeks to help abused women break the cycle of economic dependence on the very persons who may be abusing them. The Women Empowerment Initiative will achieve this by empowering women with the skills and training that enables them to find employment or start their own businesses.
“This partnership will create a pathway to economic opportunities for women at shelters. Our number one goal is the creation of opportunities for growth and jobs, and we are committed to expanding access to our programmes to all residents,” said Winde.
“Through this initiative, I would like to see us connecting more residents to facilities such as our Barn Khayelitsha and the ICAN (Interactive Community Access Network) centre in Elsies River. To ensure that aspiring business persons have access to the support they need, we will also link them to our Emerging Business Support Programme. It is my hope that we are able to make a meaningful difference in the lives of the women, and their families.”
With August earmarked as Women's Month in South Africa, Winde urged the public to report crime and gender based violence for quick responsive action. While much more is expected from government to protect women against the dangers in society but Winde explained these shelters will provide women with a positive environment to restart their lives.

LOS ANGELES: YouTube's most watched blogger PewDiePie will lose their preferred status on the Google-owned video service after posting several videos containing anti-Semitic remarks and Nazi references, the tech firm said on Tuesday (Feb 14).
YouTube said it was cancelling a popular programme from the 27-year-old Swede, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, the same day Disney said it was cutting its ties with the social media star.
PewDiePie - known for posting humorous clips to their more than 53 million followers on YouTube - will be sanctioned for violating the platform's guidelines on hate speech, Google said on Tuesday.
"We've decided to cancel the release of 'Scare PewDiePie Season 2' and we're removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred," a statement from the US tech giant said.
"Scare PewDiePie" was a programme that YouTube ordered for its online subscription service.
Google Preferred is a programme that allows advertisers to direct their messages to the key 18- to 34-year-old demographic, with an implicit guarantee that the participation won't hurt their brand.
The moves won't keep PewDiePie off YouTube but will likely limit their audience and could sharply curtail their revenue from advertising.
Separately Disney indicated it was ending its business relationship with the Swedish media star.
"Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, they clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate," according to a statement to AFP by Disney's Maker Studios.
PewDiePie, who had editorial independence under the terms of the arrangement with Disney, reportedly paid two Indian men five dollars to hold the banner reading "Death to all Jews" while they laugh and dance in the Jan 11 video.
"I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online," Kjellberg said in a Tumblr blog post on Feb 12.
"I picked something that seemed absurd to me - that people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars," referring to a website that helps freelancers receive part-time work.
The Wall Street Journal reported PewDiePie had posted nine videos that display anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi references since August.
One of them shows a man dressed as Jesus Christ, saying "Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong."
"I think it's important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes," the YouTube star said in the blog post.
Kjellberg is a top earner on YouTube, making roughly US$14.5 million (€13.6 million) last year, according to reported estimates from social media data firm NeoReach.
That amount includes splitting ad revenue with YouTube, as well as sponsorships and appearance fees.
In December, PewDiePie accused YouTube of trying to "kill" their channel and has threatened to shut it down, a move that turned out to be a publicity stunt.
The Force needs to be strong for Donald Faison to...
It turns out the Force was strong with Donald Faison after all.
After Faison, 43, told Page Six their Christmas wish was a full-scale model of the Millennium Falcon in their backyard, we found a way to make part of their wish come true.
Former Disney writer/producer/director Sam Macaroni saw our item and told us they actually have a full-scale replica of Han Solo's famed ship.
“It's a massive recreation of the cockpit Han Solo sits in,” they told us, adding that Disney was going to toss it out when they asked if they could keep it.
The model, which we're told is about 30 x 20 ft. and was built originally for “The Force Awakens” promotional videos, cost Macaroni $9,000 to move to their home.
“I love having this thing,” they said, “Every time someone delivers a pizza I plug it in and take pictures for them.”
Macaroni, who lives in the LA area, said they would be totally cool with Faison coming by to make their “sci-fi dream” come true.
When we asked if they could bring BFF Zach Braff along, Macaroni replied, “If they want to invite the entire ‘Scrubs' over that's cool.'”
Faison told us recently, “I think if somebody could pull off the Millennium Falcon in my front or backyard. I think that would be the best Christmas in the history of Christmas.”
Your move, Donald.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said they seized a large number of undeclared firearms from an American family trying to enter Canada at the Douglas border crossing last month.
On July 21, a family who said they were travelling to Alaska were pulled over for a secondary examination, where officers found a loaded revolver.

The driver was arrested and told their rights.
Officers continued their examination and found a total of 15 long guns, four handguns and several over-capacity magazines.

The CBSA said charges are pending.
“This is a reminder to all travellers entering Canada with firearms to learn about Canadian firearm laws, or rather leave their handguns at home,” Daniela Evans, CBSA's Pacific Highway District director, said.
“Anyone brings firearms or weapons into Canada must declare them to the border services officer upon entry. Failure to do so may lead to prosecution in a court of law.”

WILKES-BARRE -- Wilkes-Barre police are trying to locate a man who mysteriously showed up at Tuesday's vigil regarding a 12-year-old unsolved murder and made new claims about the cold case that startled family.
Family members of Patricia Moreton said the unidentified man showed up as the vigil ended and made accusations about the 2006 slaying.
“In 12 years, this is the very first time anyone has said anything. I don't know if it means something or if the guy was just blowing smoke,” Moreton's sister, Cathy Stephens, said Friday.
Stephens, 54, of Larksville, said police have told the family not to reveal what the man alleged until they can talk to them and investigate.
Moreton, 35, was found slain with a gunshot wound to their head on Jan. 31, 2006, inside their apartment at 340 Hazle St. in the city.
The man told Stephens they read about the planned vigil Tuesday while at a local doughnut shop and then traveled to the event at the Luzerne County Courthouse to tell family what they knew about the case.
Wilkes-Barre police obtained surveillance photos of the man and posted them on their Facebook page. They said the man is “believed to have information related to an ongoing case.”
Stephens confirmed the man in the photo is the man who approached them and their sister after the vigil on Tuesday.
They said they wanted them to go to the police station with them, but they declined and left.
“He said, ‘OK. I feel better now. I'm going on my way,' ” they recalled.
Stephens then reported the incident to Wilkes-Barre police.

Let's make this perfectly clear: Purdue's Glenn Robinson has been the most dominant player the Big Ten has seen in the last 25 years. And, it's not even close.
“Big Dog” arrived in West Lafayette from Gary (Ind.) Roosevelt High hailed–along with Chris Webber–as the nation's top prep players. Robinson debuted in 1992-93, leading the Big Ten in scoring with a 24.1 average. They took things to another level in 1993-94, leading the nation in scoring with a 30.3 average and leading the Big Ten in rebounding with a 9.8 average. No player has had a higher scoring average since.
But Robinson did more than stuff the stat sheet: They were a winner, too. They almost single-handedly led the Boilermakers to the Big Ten title in 1993-94, a No. 1 NCAA seed and the Elite Eight during a 29-5 season. They seemingly could score at will … inside, outside. There was no shot they couldn't take … and make. Robinson was unstoppable and went on to be the No. 1 pick in the 1994 draft.
Recently, I was asked via Twitter: Who are the best Big Ten players since Robinson?
Here are my eight picks, in alphabetical order.
Eric Gordon, Indiana 2007-08. The focus of an intense recruiting battle between Illinois and Indiana, Gordon was an instant star in Bloomington. They played just one season but averaged 20.9 points. Gordon was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year, first-team all-conference and third-team All-American. They were the No. 7 pick in the 2008 draft.
Frank Kaminsky, Wisconsin 2011-15. They led the Badgers to an incredible two-year run, as UW went 30-8 their junior year and 36-4 their senior season with a Final Four and national runner-up finishes, respectively. As a senior in 2014-15, Kaminsky was national player of the year and a consensus All-American. They were the No. 9 pick in the 2015 draft.
Greg Oden, Ohio State 2006-07. They played one sensational season in Scarlet and Gray, teaming with Mike Conley to lead the Buckeyes to a 35-4 record and the national title game. A ferocious defender, the seven-footer averaged 15.7 points and 9.6 rebounds en route to becoming the first first-year student to earn first-team All-American honors since 1990. They were the No. 1 pick in the 2007 draft.
Shawn Respert, Michigan State 1990-95. Their career overlapped with Glenn Robinson, but Respert stayed for one more season. And it was special effort in what was a special season in 1994-95. They led the Spartans in scoring all four seasons and left as MSU's all-time leading scorer (21.3 ppg) and the Big Ten's all-time leading scorer in league games. The 6-1 Respert averaged 25.6 points their senior year when they were consensus All-American under Jud Heathcote. No Big Ten player has averaged as many points in a season since. They were the No. 8 pick in the 1995 draft.
D'Angelo Russell, Ohio State 2014-15. The 6-5 Russell was a superstar in their only season on campus, leading the Big Ten in scoring with a 20.3 average. They were a consensus first-team All-American who was the No. 2 pick in the 2015 draft.
Jared Sullinger, Ohio State 2010-12. They played just two seasons in Columbus. But, they were spectacular. Sullinger averaged 17.2 points and 10.2 rebounds as a first-year student and 17.5 points and 9.2 boards as a sophomore. And OSU had lots of success, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the 2011 NCAA tourney with a 32-2 team and playing in the Final Four as a sophomore in 2012. The 6-9 Sullinger was a two-time consensus All-American and the No. 21 pick in the 2012 draft.
Evan Turner, Ohio State 2007-10. The 2010 Big Ten Player of the Year, Turner was the consensus national player of the year that same season. They also netted first-team All-Big Ten accolades in 2009 and 2010. As a junior, Turner became the first Big Ten player to finish in the top two in average points (1st, 20.4), rebounds (2nd, 9.2) and assists (2nd, 6.0). They were the No. 2 pick in the 2010 NBA draft after leaving school a year early. Their stunning effort in the 2010 Big Ten tourney is still legendary, highlighted by a last-second, 37-foot 3-pointer that beat Michigan. The 6-7 Turner's No. 21 was retired by the school.
Deron Williams, Illinois 2002-05. They were the alpha dog during a magical 2004-05 season in Champaign that saw the Illini go 37-2 and play in the national championship game. That season, Illinois went undefeated until the last game of the regular season, when they lost to Ohio State by one point. Fans never will forget Williams' effort in an NCAA tourney comeback win over Arizona. Illinois rallied from a late 15-point deficit to win, pushing on to the Final Four. Williams made the game-tying 3-point shot with just 38.5 seconds left in regulation. They then hit the go-ahead 3-pointer in overtime. Williams skipped their senior season and was the No. 3 pick in the 2005 NBA draft.
Others considered: Trey Burke, Michigan; Mike Conley, Ohio State; Draymond Green, Michigan State; A.J. Guyton, Indiana; Devin Harris, Wisconsin; Quincy Lewis, Minnesota; Victor Oladipo, Indiana; Jason Richardson, Michigan State; Alando Tucker, Wisconsin.
Re: More long-term care beds created (April 21)
Ontario has one of the most risk-adverse and punitive long-term care home systems in Canada. Although risk assessment tools are helpful to a degree, too much regulation prohibits innovative enhancements to resident care. With the announcement of new long-term beds for Brantford and surrounding area, should we continue to fund the "way things are" or look at other ways to provide quality care for our seniors.
Many innovative models exist and have been proven to provide residents with the care and quality of life they deserve. Seldom will you hear someone say that they look forward to spending their advanced years in a long-term care home. Yet many of us will be doing just that. Let's create homes that are appealing and become homes of choice when the need to become a resident arrives.
Now is our opportunity to demand our government consider a new model of care. .

Urban renewal better than urban sprawl
With all the Earth Day issues currently at the forefront, it seems ridiculous to complain about the proposed One Wellington condo project. Every time a construction project is planned in core areas, there are complaints. Instead of destroying farms, forests and wetlands to build housing, replacing some of the old and outdated areas is the way to go. It is important to protect our food supply and our wildlife.

: The Rajasthan Sahitya Akademi (RSA) on Monday cancelled an award it had bestowed on author Hardan Harsh, as a controversy erupted after a group of academicians claimed that their fictional work shows Mira Bai, a Hindu mystic poet and devotee of Lord Krishna, and Mewar rulers in low light.The ceremony was held on Sunday evening in Udaipur, in which Harsh's book 'Historical Mira' was shortlisted by the RSA for its prestigious annual award Rangey Raghav given to an author for outstanding work in literature.A controversy surfaced after a group of academicians raised objections to the content of the book that they alleged projected Mira Bai and Mewar rulers in low light.Mira Bai was of high character and ideals. Assassination of their character is unimaginable. Writing is good when it is based on facts and research. Imaginary writing without references is wrong, noted historian Raghvendra Manohar said.However, Harsh said that literature is not history. "I have written the book based on the references from Colonel Tods book," they told reporters in Jaipur.Rajasthan Sahitya Akademy Chairman Indu Shekhar said people are proud of the glory of Mira Bai and the Maharanas of Mewar. Controversy on Mira Bai is not at all acceptable. The decision of cancelling the award ceremony was taken in an emergency meeting of the RSA, Shekhar added.In Udaipur, fringe groups today put down the event banners at the venue and warned RSA office bearers that indecent comments on Mira Bai and rulers of Mewar will not be tolerated, police said, adding that forces were deployed as a precautionary measure.
Christopher Guest revealed the initial inspiration for This is Spinal Tap at the A.V. Club comedy festival. Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap is the legendary mockumentary on the fictional hard rock band Spinal Tap that has spawned countless imitators and has even been turned into a descriptive term to poke fun at musicians and the entire music business as a whole. Many bands have spoken up to claim that they were the inspiration for This is Spinal Tap and there have been a few confirmed stories that made it into the movie, but the original inspiration for the cult-favorite mockumentary has never been revealed.
After taking part in the School of Film live event for A.V. Club's comedy festival, Guest took questions from the audience. One audience member stood up and asked Guest if any of the characters that they have portrayed over the yeas were autobiographical. After making a joke, Guest said that none of their characters over the yeas have been autobiographical, but rather all from their personal inspiration.
Guest then brought up This is Spinal Tap and told the real-life story that inspired This is Spinal Tap. Christopher Guest sets up the story by saying that they were at a hotel lobby in Los Angeles in 1974, waiting for a friend when they overheard a conversation at the front desk. Guest goes on to explain.
"An English band was checking in, this was 1974. The manager and I think there were four of them, they went up to the desk and they started to the thing, I was just waiting for my friend. And the manager says to one of them "where's your bass?" "what?" "Where's your bass?" "I dunno, I think I left it at the airport"
Guest says that the exchange went on for about 15 minutes and that it was the best moment of their life next to meeting their wife. Guest does not reveal who the band was, but they do a hilarious impression of the exchange between the manager of the band and the bass player. It is pretty cool, after all of these years, to hear the real story that sparked the fictional Spinal Tap.
This is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner has said that a lot of the mockumentary was based off of concert films of the day like the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter and the Bands' Last Waltz with a sprinkle of Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same. Many bands have come forward to accuse the fictional band of ripping them off. For instance, Black Sabbath claims that the Stonehenge bit was based off of their actual stage prop, but the movie was filmed a whole year before Sabbath's tour that featured a Stonehenge prop. The British heavy metal band Saxon claims to be the biggest influence because Tap bass player, Harry Shearer did indeed tour with Saxon before the making of the movie.
This is Spinal Tap was carved out of hours and hours of completely adlibbed material by Guest and fellow band mates, Shearer and Michael McKean. All three of the actors wrote the songs and played all of the instruments in the studio and have even played live concerts as Spinal Tap over the years, mostly for charity. Many bands may claim to be the real inspiration for This is Spinal Tap, but they're all wrong as Guest points out. Watch the hilarious video below.
Merck & Co Inc said its chief executive, Kenneth Frasier, was resigning from U.S. President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council, following the recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia.
REUTERS: Merck & Co Inc Chief Executive Kenneth Frasier resigned from U.S. President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council on Monday, saying they were taking a stand against intolerance and extremism.
A gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Virginia took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.
Trump had said "many sides" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.
"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal," Frazier said in a tweet announcing their resignation. (http://bit.ly/2fFnITM)
Trump responded in a tweet, now that "Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, they will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!"
Several executives from top U.S. companies have stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies.

LONDON: England's top cricket administrator may feel young people no longer care about cricket, but the man running the sport's global governing body is adamant youth interest is rising worldwide.
And David Richardson, the chief executive of the International Cricket Council, added that that next year's World Cup in England and Wales represents a brilliant opportunity to prove the doubters wrong.

Colin Graves, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairperson, sparked controversy with their recent comment that young people "are just not attracted to cricket". It appeared they were trying to justify the proposed introduction of a new 100-ball format into the English game in 2020.
But many cricket lovers were aghast at Graves's seeming lack of faith in their own sport, while others were equally dismayed by what they saw as a slap in the face for various youth cricket initiatives, including those of the ECB itself.
Photographs of young fans enjoying themselves at various English county grounds and other games started appearing on Twitter in response to Graves's statement.
Richardson, too diplomatic to join in the criticism, was nevertheless keen to defend cricket's appeal to the next generation while speaking in London on Wednesday (May 30) at an event marking a year to the start of the 2019 World Cup.

"That is very much an English viewpoint," Richardson said, when asked about Graves's comments.
"Globally we are seeing in our sport, compared to other sports, the average age of the fan is lower than even football and certainly rugby.
"Market by market, it varies widely - in England, I think, there is a bit of a challenge making sure we re-engage with the youth and grow the game from a participation point of view - but elsewhere in the world, it is quite positive."
NO "APPETITE" FOR NEW FORMAT
Meanwhile Richardson, while noting domestic limited-overs cricket had been played in a variety of formats down the years, was in no hurry to add the 100-ball game to an international schedule already groaning under the weight of Tests, one-day internationals and Twenty20s.
"Our strategy is clear in that we've got three formats of the same game, which is challenging in itself to keep them from cannibalising each other," they said.
"But what it does do is provide us an opportunity to provide an offering to everybody, every type of cricket fan, from the traditional old Test cricket fan to a youngster who wants something to be happening every ball.
"And the 50-over version, I think, is that perfect fit between Test and T20. It provides a perfect day's entertainment, we've seen that around the world - it is very popular elsewhere in the world - and the World Cup has got that prestige which I think will help cement 50-over cricket's popularity well into the future."
"But certainly there isn't an appetite to increase and create another format," the former South Africa wicket-keeper explained.
Asked if the ECB, which last year successfully staged both the Champions Trophy and the Women's World Cup last year, needed help from the ICC in marketing the World Cup, Richardson replied: "We don't need to hold their hand or do anything (like that). They are quite capable themselves, I'm sure.
"But the bottom line is that this does present a huge opportunity - and we saw it with the Women's World Cup - to attract a new audience to get people enthused who weren't necessarily going to cricket matches season after season.
"I think there is a huge opportunity in having an event in your own country."
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - London-listed drugmaker Shire Plc said it was willing to recommend a deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co to its shareholders, after the Japanese company sweetened its acquisition offer to 46 billion pounds ($64 billion).

The development, first reported by Reuters, represents a major breakthrough for the companies in their negotiations, following a pursuit that started on March 28 when Takeda said it was considering a bid for Shire. Since then, Takeda has made five offers, the latest on Tuesday.
Shire said in a statement it had agreed to extend a Wednesday regulatory deadline for the deal talks to conclude to May 8 in order to allow Takeda to carry out more due diligence and firm up its bid. Shire added that the deadline could be extended further, if needed.
Takeda's shares slid almost 6 percent in early Tokyo trade on Wednesday as investors fretted over its ability to finance the cash and stock deal.
Any deal between the two companies is still subject to the resolution of several issues, including completion of due diligence by Shire on Takeda, Shire said.
Takeda added in its own statement that it intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating following the deal.
Shire focuses on treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A deal would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers.
It would significantly boost Takeda's position in gastrointestinal disorders, neuroscience, and rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise.
But the transaction would be a huge financial stretch, since Shire is worth considerably more than the Japanese group. Ambitious cost cutting will be required to make the deal pay.
Related Coverage Takeda shares slide 5 percent after revised proposal for Shire
Dealmaking has surged in the drug industry this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. A Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest. Shire has long been seen as a likely takeover target and was nearly bought by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc in 2014, until U.S. tax rule changes caused the deal to fall apart. Shire also has a track record of acquisitions, but its biggest ever deal - the $32 billion purchase of Baxalta in 2016 - was widely criticized by shareholders.
Dublin-based Shire, a member of Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 stock index, said Takeda's fifth offer was worth 49.01 pounds per share, comprised of the equivalent of 27.26 pounds per share in new Takeda shares and 21.75 pounds per share in cash. Under these terms, Shire shareholders would own half of the combined company.
ALLERGAN BOWED OUT
Allergan Plc, the U.S. maker of Botox, had been considering a rival bid for Shire but ruled itself out of making an offer last week.
Shire also announced last week it was selling its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion.
Takeda has lost more than 17 percent since the news broke that it was considering a bid for Shire, reducing its market value to 3.6 trillion yen ($33 billion).
Takeda investors have been skeptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.

Weber was promoted to CEO in 2015, becoming the drugmaker's first non-Japanese boss.
Shire traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire. Since then it has grown rapidly through acquisitions to generate revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.

Sensex closed at 32,923.12 points, down 0.76%; the Nifty closed at 10,094.25, down 0.99%, below 10,100 for the first time since 6 December
Mumbai: The markets cracked with the benchmark indices losing nearly 1% on Monday ahead of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US starting Tuesday night. The Sensex closed at 32,923.12 points, down 0.76%; the Nifty closed at 10,094.25, down 0.99%, below 10,100 for the first time since 6 December.
The day's losses left the Sensex nearly 10% below a record high of 36,443.98 on 29 January.
Analysts said investors are nervous due to uncertainty around current political developments, while the local macroeconomic situation is not improving. India's current account deficit (CAD) widened to 2% of gross domestic product, or $13.5 billion, in the December quarter, up from 1.4%, or $8 billion, a year ago.
According to Amar Ambani, partner and head of research, IIFL Investment Managers, a higher CAD did hurt investor sentiment, but other local problems relating to the Punjab National Bank scam and the regulator barring banks from issuing letters of undertaking also had an impact.
“Investors are increasingly worried about the 2019 general election after the UP by-polls results rattled sentiments,” they added. On Wednesday, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lost two key parliamentary seats it held in Uttar Pradesh.
Ambani said the Nifty may further correct by 3-4% and warned it may soon touch 9,700 points. After the stellar rally in 2017, both the Sensex and the Nifty have slipped 3-4% in the year so far while the BSE Midcap index has lost over 10% in the same period.
On Monday, mid-cap and small-cap stocks fell the most, with the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices losing 1.58% and 1.98%, respectively.
In a note on Monday, Kotak Institutional Equities said the surprising defeat of the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh by-polls and the Telugu Desam Party's announcement to pull out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will likely increase speculation about the nature of pre-poll alliances for the 2019 general election and the nature of the government's policies over the next 12 months.
Investors will also be watching the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. After hawkish comments by new chief Jerome Powell, the central bank is expected to increase rates more than three times this year as anticipated earlier. US rate increases generally lead to outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets considered to be riskier assets.
Some analysts such as Vinod Karki, vice-president (strategy) at ICICI Securities Ltd, do not see any impact on foreign funds despite rate hikes by the Fed stating that it is already factored in the markets.
“Right now, Indian markets are weighed by global concerns about the trade war threat while introduction of long-term capital gains tax, high valuations and election uncertainties are causing jitters among investors,” they said.
March quarter earnings are expected to be the next big trigger for the markets.
When their husband's 11-year-old love-child turns up on their doorstep one hot London night, Cat Lupo must decide whether they could ever give the now motherless girl a home.
But as the events behind Ruby Winter's shock arrival start to emerge, Cat fears that their attempts to help this strangely unsettling child have put their own precious daughter at risk.
Award-winning author, journalist and co-founder of the Killer Women writing collective, Mel McGrath sends shivers down the spine in this explosive, high-tension psychological thriller set against the violent and corrosive backdrop of the 2011 London riots.
A dark and disturbing page-turner, Give Me the Child is a stunning yet sensitive exploration of a family in meltdown and a city in crisis, drawing upon the latest research in adult and child mental health to ask uncomfortable but important questions about how much we know about our partners, our children… and ourselves.
Dr Cat Lupo, an expert in child personality disorders, longs for another child. Them daughter Freya, now aged 11, was born through IVF but their arrival was overshadowed because Cat suffered pregnancy psychosis, a ‘wild paranoia' so severe that they had to be put into a special unit in the weeks leading up to the birth.
When their husband Tom's 11-year-old love-child turns up in the middle of the night, Cat is understandably devastated by the shocking discovery that they had a one-night stand while they were in care before Freya's birth.
However, Cat's instincts as child psychologist kick in and, knowing that Ruby is now alone because their mother is dead, they feel sorry for the girl and agrees that they can move in with them for the time being.
But they soon realises that Ruby is not like their own sweet and innocent daughter; Ruby possesses a kind of ‘force field' which makes being close to them unsettling and as the events behind their mother Lilly's death in their south London flat emerge, Cat fears the sinister girl is a threat to Freya's safety.
Cat's research tells them there is no such thing as evil, their history tells them they are paranoid but their instincts tell them another story. And as the police fight to control a sudden outbreak of riots raging across the capital, Cat faces a race against time of their own…
Thrillers featuring dysfunctional families have always had a seductive appeal and McGrath plays on every parent's deepest fears as Cat desperately tries to separate suspicions about their own tendency to paranoia from the very real and shocking possibility that Ruby harbours a genuine malevolence.
There is terror aplenty in the suggestive power of McGrath's narrative as we contemplate the thorny concept of evil and follow Cat's hunt for the truth about Ruby, their mother Lilly, their evasive husband Tom, and dark secrets from the past.
The constant contradiction between Cat's professional knowledge and experience, and their fears and emotional reactions, are superbly depicted as McGrath draws their readers deeper and deeper into the claustrophobic intensity of the unfolding drama and a crumbling marriage.
Juxtaposed against the social unrest that is stalking the streets of London, this emotive and compelling tale of a family facing its own turmoil is a cracking thriller, packed with wisdom and insight, and one that will haunt long after the last page has turned.

An Altona man is facing multiple charges after trying to bite the neck of a local police officer.
Concerned tenants of an apartment on Maple Bay reported a disturbance to police around 6:30 PM on April 14, indicating the lone occupant of a neighbouring apartment was yelling, screaming and swearing from inside their unit.
When police arrived they couldn't find the man, but later located the 35 year old walking down a street in town. The suspect instantly became belligerent with officers and resisted to the point where police had to use force to arrest him. It was during the arrest that the man attempted to bite an officer in the neck.
Once in custody, the man quickly become passively resistant which required officers to carry them into the police station.
The suspect has been transferred to the Manitoba Remand Centre where they are awaiting a future court date to answer to charges of Mischief, Resisting Arrest, Assaulting a Police Officer, Breach of Probation and Possession of a Controlled Substance.

Entanglement follows a sad sack character with mental issues and their attempts to deal (or not) with the circumstances in which they find himself.
Benjamin Layton (Thomas Middleditch) is such a sad sack that, when we meet him, he's in the midst of a series of darkly hilarious failed suicide attempts – the last of which would have succeeded if they hadn't decided to answer the door for a delivery.
Using the concept of multiple universes being caused by branching out whenever a decision is made, Ben plots out their life – in thread – on their living room wall. To no avail.
A visit to their shrink (Joannah Newmarch) yields a prescription but little else. Then, on a trip to their pharmacy to pick up some meds, they see a young woman steal a pair of sunglasses and take off.
Then they discover that their parents – Norm (Eric Keenleyside) and Betty (Marilyn Norry) – had adopted a baby girl but had had to return them to the adoption agency when they discovered their mother was pregnant.
Convinced that almost having a sister is the missing piece to their life, they and their best friend and neighbor, Tabby (Diana Bang), set out to find them A $50 bribe later and they have a copy of their file.
When Ben approaches the house at the address they have found, he's intercepted by the same young woman they saw in the pharmacy (Jess Weixler). Thus begins a truly unique relationship…
Entanglement uses the tropes of a romantic dramedy to explore mental health issues; familial relationships and not seeing what's right in front on one's face.
As Jess and Hannah's relationship evolves, bizarre things begin to happen – emphasized onscreen by clever little animation effects (jellyfish, fireworks, and so forth).
Despite their seeming happiness with the increasingly adventurous Hannah, Tabby seems disturbed by the relationship and warns them to be careful.
As Entanglement progresses, we learn why Ben wanted to commit suicide, and how they and Hannah seem to be entangled like particles bonded through quantum entanglement (a highly improbable series of coin tosses seem to verify this).
The combination of an offbeat, slightly whimsical script (by Jason Filiatrault); a light touch by director Jason James, and carefully modulated performances by Middleditch, Weixler and Bang all add up to a genuinely special film.
Adding to the unusual feel of the film is a soundtrack that's imported from a different decade but feels completely appropriate.
Entanglement is a small indie film that will probably be hard to find but will be well worth the effort.

COPENHAGEN: Siemens will close a factory making blades for wind turbines in Engesvang in Denmark and cut 430 jobs, as it is unable to expand the site to meet demand for bigger blades, the company said on Wednesday.
Siemens will instead focus on production of blades for wind turbines at two other plants in Denmark, spokesperson Rasmus Windfeld said.
After the job cuts, Siemens will employ around 6,500 people in Denmark, which is more than the company employed a year ago, they said.

PARIS: Eating nuts "significantly" boosted the number and health of sperm in young men in a scientific trial, researchers said on Wednesday (Jul 4).
The findings "support a beneficial role for chronic nut consumption in sperm quality," they said, but stressed the study participants were all healthy, apparently fertile men.

The potential benefits of nuts for men struggling with fertility have yet to be probed.
For the study, researchers recruited 119 men aged 18-35, who they divided into two groups.
One group ate 60 grammes of almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts daily on top of their usual "western-style" diet, while the second group got no nuts.
After 14 weeks, the nut group "had significant improvements in their sperm count, vitality, motility (movement) and morphology (shape)" - all associated with male fertility, said a statement.

"Moreover, the subjects in the nut group also showed a significant reduction in their levels of sperm DNA fragmentation, a parameter closely associated with male infertility."
The results were consistent with sperm improvement observed in other studies that looked at diets rich in omega-3, antioxidants such as vitamin C and E, selenium and zinc, and folate.
Nuts are rich in many of these nutrients.
The study results were presented at a meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona.
Does this mean that men hoping to conceive a child should add nuts to their diet?
"We can't yet say that," said study co-author Albert Salas-Huetos of the Rovira i Virgili University in Spain.
"But evidence is accumulating in the literature that healthy lifestyle changes such as following a healthy dietary pattern might help conception - and of course, nuts are a key component of a Mediterranean healthy diet."
The number of City job seekers rose last month as EU nationals scrambled for employment in hopes of securing UK residency ahead of Brexit, but recruiters warn that the Square Mile is still " haemorrhaging talent" as a result of the referendum result.
The latest London employment monitor by recruiter Morgan McKinley recorded a 12% month-on-month rise in professionals seeking jobs in July, which compares to a 14% drop during the same period last year.
Hakan Enver, Morgan McKinley's operations director for financial services, said it was likely a reaction to Government plans to end freedom of movement by the Brexit negotiation deadline in March 2019.
"EU nationals who want to stay in Britain have a shrinking window of opportunity to get a job and permanent residency, and many are seizing it," they said.
The survey also noted a 1% month-on-month increase in vacancies, which it said was a "significant upturn" for July considering that summer months are usually marked by a double-digit slowdown in jobs activity.
Mr Enver said: "Normally the City clocks out for July, but with the industry being swept from under them, people are scrambling to make the most of the time left in the EU."
But annual comparisons are less cheery, showing a 11% drop in vacancies and a 33% fall in job seekers, proving the City is "still haemorrhaging talent" due to Brexit, they added.
It follows a string of relocation announcements from financial services firms in recent months, with many revealing the site of their new EU headquarters.
Deutsche Bank last month warned UK staff that roles may be shifted as it was likely to book the "vast majority" of its asset out of Frankfurt after Brexit, while Bank of America said it had chosen Dublin as its new European hub but stopped short of unveiling staffing plans.
Goldman Sachs has indicated it would at least double the size of its Frankfurt employee base to 400, as US peer Citigroup said it would create approximately 150 new roles across its EU offices.
Most recently, RBS said it would employ 150 staff in Amsterdam as part of its Brexit contingency plans.
Mr Enver said technology is helping drive fragmentation amid the Brexit exodus, making it unnecessary for financial services firms to huddle together in one hub like Frankfurt or Dublin.
"Until recently, it had been assumed that the financial services industry was hub dependent, either remaining in London, or moving to a specific new location.
"A multitude of locations picking away at City jobs, however, suggests that a conglomeration of institutions may soon be a thing of the past," the report explained.
BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — The Red Cross is making a plea to all donors right now, asking them to step up and help out as there's a great need for all blood types.
Around 64,000 units are needed each day at hospitals around the nation.
“We're able to have products in the hospital but we're using them as quickly as they come in,” said Jay Bonafede, the regional communications director for the American Red Cross.
During the summer, the number of donors drops. The American Red Cross cites several reasons for that ranging from schools being out of session and fewer blood drives planned to people being on vacations and switching up routines.
“It's something that cannot be created,” said Bonafede.”It has to be donated.”
The Red Cross says most donations stay right here in the region, helping out people in Western New York.
“If someone has a major accident or something like that, they can't wait for someone to com,” said Bonafede. “We need to have the products on the shelf and ready to go as necessary. It's really a very simple way to make a huge impact on the community.”
The Regional Trial Court yesterday extended the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) it granted to Banco de Oro (BDO) Unibank and ordered a Status Quo Ante to afford BDO and the Cebu City government a chance to come up with an agreement regarding the pending business permit applications of 26 BDO branches and the looming closure of its Magallanes branch.
RTC Branch 18 Presiding Judge Gilbert Moises “encouraged” both parties to discuss with one another the possibility of an amicable settlement during the hearing of BDO's Petition for Mandamus yesterday afternoon.
In the meantime, the court also ordered a status quo ante on the bank's operations until March 6. This means the city cannot take action against BDO.

The management of Banco de Oro (BDO) Unibank and the Cebu City government welcomed the decision which was arrived at during a closed-door chamber conference called by Moises with BDO and City Hall lawyers as well as Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña at one point, during the hearing.
“The TRO has been extended for the full 20 days. We maintain status quo and let's see. The judge required us to submit a memorandum, and we will comply. But in the meantime, we maintain status quo because we complied with everything. Well, let's take it from there,” said lawyer Alvin Go, one of BDO's two lawyers during the hearing.
Moises also asked both parties to submit their respective memoranda as to the pending Petition for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction within 10 days.
Another hearing was also set on February 27.
City Legal Officer Joseph Bernaldez said that while the order of a status quo might seem like an extension of the 72-hour TRO granted to BDO, “it's not really a TRO.”
“We will look into their report on their assessment on the part of BDO. And on our side, we will also evaluate their assessment and probably also make our own assessment. We will compare it and look at which one is right and beneficial to the parties,” Bernaldez said.
They added that they have traded cell phone numbers with BDO's lawyers and that they will soon be agreeing on a date in order to meet and discuss a possible settlement.
Osmeña has been threatening to close BDO's Magallanes branch due to alleged tax fraud. They have been emphatic in making pronouncements that they would close the branch.
This too was recognized by the court as well as the mayor themselves during their chamber conference.
“I have freedom of speech, but they just asked me to kalma kalma lang ba (just be calm)… Basta, no more comments. You will hear later on, sooner or later,” Osmeña said in an interview after their conference.
They also claimed that they were given ten days to decide whether or not to close the BDO Magallanes branch and to provide documents to support their decision.
BDO sought remedy from the court through its petition so that the mayor would act on BDO's pending business permit applications for their 27 branches in city. Of BDO's 28 branches in the city, only the branch in SM Seaside was given a business permit as it did not operate in 2016.
During yesterday's hearing, Bernaldez asked the court to dismiss the petition, saying the mayor's duty of issuing a permit is discretionary and not ministerial as ruled by Supreme Court in several cases.
But lawyer Salvador Peña, BDO's other lawyer, explained that their Petition for Mandamus is not to compel the mayor to approve BDO's permit applications but just to act on it and “without bias.”
They said BDO was constrained to seek judicial intervention because the mayor was treating BDO's permit as a “special case,” with underlying “other motives.”
Go also argued that while BDO had submitted all required documents for their business permit application, the City Treasurer's Office (CTO) required them to submit additional documents which, they said, should not even be included anymore.
Among the documents asked by the city, Go said, was a consolidated income tax return of BDO as well as their VAT (value added tax) payments. They pointed out that banks do not pay VAT since they only pay gross receipts tax to the national government.
“We are here to tell the truth. Everything has been laid down. We find no reason for the mayor's office to not act on our application,” Go said.
It was at this point, around 30 minutes after the hearing started at 1:30 p.m., when the judge asked the lawyers to join them for a chamber conference.
They came out at around 45 minutes later.
Wall Street was lower on Friday as energy shares dropped sharply and added to the dour mood set by the first decline in U.S. nonfarm jobs in seven years.
REUTERS: Wall Street was lower on Friday as energy shares dropped sharply and added to the dour mood set by the first decline in U.S. nonfarm jobs in seven years.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed nonfarm payrolls fell by 33,000 in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring.
However, a bright spot was the better-than-expected rise in average wages, up 0.5 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase estimated by economists polled by Thomson Reuters.
The gain was the largest since December 2016, helping lift the dollar to a 12-week high.
"I think most people realized going in that the headline numbers would be distorted because of the storms, but the surprise was the average hourly earnings," said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets currency strategy, Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
S&P energy index declined about 1 percent as oil prices looked set to end a five-week bull run amid a bout of profit taking and the return of oversupply worries.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.98 points, or 0.12 percent, at 6,577.37 after hitting its sixth-straight record high.

SINGAPORE: In a case of real life inspiring reel life, a Bollywood producer is planning to make a movie on Dr Mahathir Mohamad's return to office as Malaysia's prime minister.

Tentatively titled Malaysia's Saviour Mahathir, the movie will be shot in Hindi and dubbed into Malay and English.
Raman Kumar, 73, told Bernama that the film would focus on how Dr Mahathir's "common sense, wisdom" and their experience as prime minister from 1981 to 2003 won the nation's votes for their campaign against anti-corruption.
A Pakatan Harapan-backed Dr Mahathir toppled the Barisan Nasional coalition headed by their predecessor and former protege Najib Razak at the May 9 general election.
“I want to tell the intense story of the remaking of Malaysia after six decades of trials and tribulations, and the way Malaysians intensely felt the moment the opposition won,” said Raman.

If Dr Mahathir were to appear in the film, it would not be their acting debut. In 2015, the then-90-year-old prime minister appeared as themselves in the Malaysian sci-fi and history film Kapsul. The movie featured a business person who went back in time to the Japanese Occupation of 1942 after stealing and opening a time capsule. Dr Mahathir was one of the prime ministers the character met.
"I have a small role. I've never done any acting like this before. So I thought why not just go for it," said Dr Mahathir in The Star, after the Kapsul press preview. "I just have to act as how I usually am in public."
Raman said they have engaged Malaysian journalist and associate professor M Krishnamoorthy to write the script. The producer, who resides in the United Kingdom, Mumbai and Malaysia, has produced 10 movies, including five in Malaysia, according to Bernama.

When my grandmother, Viva Moore Adams, died in 1991 at age 96, they were the sole occupant of their seven-room house, which was filled with things as was most of a four-room house they also owned across their driveway.

“Dostadning” is Swedish for death cleaning, and in January of this year, Margaret Magnusson released their book entitled, “The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning: How to Free Yourself and Your Family from a Lifetime of Clutter.”
Magnusson maintains that this decluttering can occur at any age or at any stage of life. My grandmother had not done this, as I believe they thought they would live forever.
Before their funeral, the will was read and after the Central Baptist Church service and the brief ceremony at the burial site at Huff Cemetery, the fun began. My mother and the five children of my grandmother's deceased daughter and son, the inheritors of their estate, began the process of cleaning out the houses. I left as I didn't want to see their homes disassembled with their belongings going in rented trucks to Ohio, Georgia, and Texas.
After my mother went to live in a nursing home in Toledo, some of my grandmother's possessions came my way: a marble-top table, a sewing machine, a large antique oval frame with my great grandfather's portrait and other pieces.
Knowing of my interest in education, my grandmother had given me their library table, which measures a sturdy five feet, decades ago. And in 1986, when I was on my way to become president of Lee College in Texas, they reluctantly gave me an opal and amethyst ring that had belonged to their youngest daughter, Muriel.
My grandson, Jack Tyler, recently bought their first home, so opportunity knocked. The piano I purchased a decade-plus ago, and that I never learned to play, went straight to their home — at a price of $275 to have it moved.  They are the main musician in our family, so where else should it go? And I convinced them to take other items as well.

Periodically, I donate a suitcase of books to the library at Edison State Community College, where I teach. I also teach a variety of courses to telecommunication employees, so I continue to buy books. My leisure reading is a part of my life as well, and I can usually read a book in a day. In my time, at least 5,000-plus books have passed through my hands. What if I had attempted to keep all of them?

PHNOM PENH: A Cambodian journalist charged with "incitement to commit a felony" over their election coverage said on Tuesday that has fled the country fearing arrest and has been given refugee asylum status by the U.N. refugee agency.
Aun Pheap, 54, now in the United States, was charged in August last year along with a colleague, Zsombor Peter, a Canadian, after an interview with former opposition members. It was not immediately clear what felony they are suspected of inciting was.
The pair worked for the now closed Cambodia Daily and face up to two years in prison if found guilty.
The ruling party of Prime Minister Hun Sen and its allies have waged a crackdown against what they say are critics of the government, including human rights advocates and opposition lawmakers, in the leadup to the July 29 general election.
Hun Sen is expected to easily win the vote after the main opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party was dissolved in November and dozens of its lawmakers were banned from politics.
The English-language Cambodia Daily was shut down last year after it was given a month to pay US$6.3 million for years of back taxes amid the crackdown, which has also extended to independent media.

"If I go back to Cambodia, it is for sure that I will be arrested," Aun Pheap told Reuters on Tuesday from the United States where they are attending a journalism workshop and waiting to hear back about an asylum application there.
Aun Pheap said that the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) had granted them refugee status in January and that they left for the United States on March 25.
They denied the charges against him.
UNHCR did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. A Cambodian government spokesperson declined to comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - West Ham United have sacked director of player recruitment Tony Henry following allegations of racial discrimination, the Premier League club said on Friday.
According to a report in the Daily Mail newspaper, Henry said the club wanted to limit the number of African players in their squad as “they have a bad attitude” and “cause mayhem” when they are not in the team.
A statement from the club said: ”West Ham United have today terminated the contract of Director of Player Recruitment, Tony Henry, with immediate effect following their unacceptable comments that were widely reported in the press. Our action follows a full and thorough investigation.
”West Ham United will not tolerate any type of discrimination.
“The West Ham United family is an inclusive one where, regardless of gender, age, ability, race, religion or sexual orientation, everybody feels welcome and included.”
The decision follows the Football Association announcing on Thursday that it was investigating the matter, the same day that West Ham launched their own investigation and suspended Henry.
Henry joined West Ham in 2014, having previously worked for Everton, Sunderland and Chelsea.
West Ham have six first-team squad members of African descent - Cheikhou Kouyate, Pedro Obiang, Joao Mario, Angelo Ogbonna, Arthur Masuaku and Edimilson Fernandes.
Kouyate posted a message on Instagram on Thursday, saying: “African and proud”.
The post was liked by teammates Obiang, Masuaku, Manuel Lanzini and Adrian.
Deutsche Bank has outlined clearly differentiated roles for the co-heads of its revamped investment bank to make it more efficient and is also creating a new global markets division.
FRANKFURT: Deutsche Bank has outlined clearly differentiated roles for the co-heads of its revamped investment bank to make it more efficient and is also creating a new global markets division.
In an email to employees on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank said it wanted to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the organization, which would in turn lead to substantial cost savings this year.
Marcus Schenck and Garth Ritchie, named this year to lead the reorganized corporate and investment bank, outlined in the email how they would split their duties.
Germany's largest lender has been trying to regain its footing after a series of scandals, lawsuits and bets that went wrong pushed it to the brink of collapse last year.
The memo said Schenck would concentrate on clients, overseeing corporate finance, global capital markets, and the bank's institutional client group.

Ritchie will focus on products and processes, supervising equities, fixed income and currencies, global transaction banking, electronic trading, listed derivatives and clearing, research and the division's technology and operations.
The new global capital markets division announced in the memo will be jointly headed by Alexander von zur Muehlen in Frankfurt and Mark Fedorcik in New York.
Schenck and Ritchie said the changes would take effect on July 1, when Schenck moves to the corporate and investment bank full time after serving as Deutsche's chief financial officer.
Bloomberg News first reported the details of the memo.
Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank said it would combine its divisions for markets, corporate finance and global transaction banking into a single corporate and investment bank (CIB) as part of a broader restructuring of Germany's biggest lender.

In the memo, Schenck and Ritchie said the executive committee of the corporate and investment bank (CIB) had asked a special team "to reduce bureaucracy and complexity, which will achieve substantial cost savings in 2017."
"Their success will directly affect CIB's 2017 profitability and compensation program," the email said. "We ask you to support them as they implement changes."
Deutsche Bank transformed itself into a major player on Wall Street over the past two decades, but bets that backfired and a series of scandals resulted in a litigation bill of 15 billion euros (US$16.8 billion) since 2009.
While rivals spent the years since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers cleaning up and finding new business models, Deutsche Bank did not restructure as quickly as others and was hit by a series of lawsuits over its conduct.
The bank has settled its most painful litigation cases, including the alleged manipulation of interest rates and sham equities trading in Russia, which surfaced as late as 2015.
At the end of last year it finally settled with the U.S. Department of Justice for misselling toxic mortgages, agreeing to pay US$7.2 billion.

When William Cornick murdered Ann Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds two years ago, they became the first pupil to kill a teacher in a British classroom.
But police figures show at least 38 weapons were seized in or near West Yorkshire schools during 2016 – the equivalent of three every month.
They include lock knives, stanley knives and craft knives as well as four knuckle dusters and a pistol.
The most commonly held though were kitchen knives, with 13 seized by police during the course of the year.
In addition, at least 52 offences of possessing a weapon were recorded where the item was not specified.
It is little wonder then, that police recognise the need to teach schoolchildren about the risks to themselves and others if they decide to carry a weapon.
It might seem unnecessary to be teaching younger children about the dangers of carrying weapons, but one Freedom of Information request reveals that the youngest child in West Yorkshire to have a weapon confiscated between 2013 and 2015 was just seven years old.
The same data showed that almost 60 per cent of the pupils who had weapons confiscated from them at school during that period were aged between 11 and 14 years old.
Chief Insp Alisa Newman said the reasons for young people carrying a weapon can be varied, but bullying or fear of becoming a victim of crime can both be factors.
“There's certainly cases where people may feel it does give them a level of protection,” they said.
“Part of the education and engagement is looking at why they might feel pressurised and look at the broader issues that may be affecting a community or school. It's just as important as taking the weapon away.”

#5 Dalton Castle
Unique...yet effective.
I believe Wikipedia hit the nail on the head when they described Dalton Castle's gimmick as a cross between Gorgeous George, Adrian Street, Ric Flair, and Goldust. Castle, however, typically embraces the crowd's favoritism as one of the top babyface performers on the Ring of Honor roster.
Early on in Castles career, many, including this writer, never really pictured them as a potential top-tier performer. But, as they evolved as a complete performer, Dalton honed their craft to the absolute highest level. In fact, Dalton reached the pinnacle of their industry in December of 2017, when they defeated Cody Rhodes at the 2017 ROH Final Battle pay-per-view, which resulted in Castle capturing the Ring of Honor World Championship.
Dalton would hold that title for nearly 200 days, until they finally lost the Championship to Jay Lethal on June 30, 2018, at a television taping in Fairfax, Virginia.
NEW YORK: Grammy Award-winning singer Mariah Carey shrugged off a botched New Year's Eve show in New York's Times Square, telling fans and critics on Sunday that life does not always go as planned.
"S**t happens," Carey, the world's million-selling female singer, wrote on Twitter. "Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here's to making more headlines in 2017."
Carey, named the Grammy's Best New Artist in 1991, was the final musical act on ABC's "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest," taking the stage just before midnight.
In addition to the television audience, the program was watched in person by the hundreds of thousands of people who gathered in what is called the "Crossroads of the World" to mark the beginning of 2017.
Carey's opening song, a rendition of Robert Burns' "Auld Lang Syne," seemed to go as planned. But then the singer, surrounded by dancers and a sea of humanity, appeared flustered and complained of technical difficulties.
"We can't hear," they said, as the music from their 1991 hit song "Emotions" began to play. "It is what it is," they said. "Let the audience sing, OK?"
But the awkwardness persisted, prompting Carey to say: "I want a holiday, too. Can I not have one? I'm trying to be a good sport here."
The next song, "We Belong Together," Carey's 2005 hit, went awry as well. Carey dropped their hand-held microphone to their side and the song went on playing, revealing that they may have been only syncing their lips to the words.
"It just doesn't get any better," a frustrated Carey said after the song.
After the debacle, some fans came to Carey's defense on Twitter, while others were less than kind. Several tweets compared them to the disgraced pop duo Milli Vanilli, who lost their Grammy for Best New Artist in 1990 when it emerged they had never sung on their records.
A spokesperson for Carey said later on Sunday that there was no lip-syncing. "It is not uncommon for artists to sing to track during certain live performances," spokesperson Nicole Perna said in a statement.
Carey's ear piece was not working before or during the performance and technicians could not fix it, but they took the stage anyway "essentially flying blind" so they could honor a commitment, Perna said.
A spokesperson for ABC declined to comment.

Norway striker Joshua King suffered a hamstring injury in the 8-0 World Cup qualifying win over San Marino and will miss the final group game against Northern Ireland on Sunday, the Norwegian FA said in a statement.
REUTERS: Norway striker Joshua King suffered a hamstring injury in the 8-0 World Cup qualifying win over San Marino and will miss the final group game against Northern Ireland on Sunday, the Norwegian FA said in a statement.
Fourth in Group C and 17 points behind leaders Germany, Norway has no chance of making next year's finals in Russia, but they hammered San Marino on Thursday with King grabbing two goals before being substituted in the 62nd minute.
"I felt something in my hamstring during the game yesterday and with my history we're not taking any risks," said King, who scored 16 league goals last season and has one in seven games this campaign for English Premier League side Bournemouth.
"Myself, Lars (Lagerback, Norway coach) and the medical team discussed it and agreed that I should go home to get fit again a quickly as possible," the 25-year-old added.
Having amassed 19 points and a seven-point lead over the Czech Republic with one game left to play, Northern Ireland are guaranteed to finish in second place in Group C regardless of the result against Norway in Oslo.

SINGAPORE: The Woodlands Health Campus (WHC), the first hospital in Woodlands, is expected to use the widespread adoption of technology to improve the patient care experience.
The 1,800-bed facility, which broke ground on Tuesday (Apr 18), will open progressively from 2022.
Located along Woodlands Drive 17, it will be about the size of 11 football fields and serve more than 935,000 residents. It will feature an integrated acute and community hospital, specialist outpatient clinics and a long-term care facility.
Speaking at the groundbreaking event, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the use of smart technology to raise the bar for patient care and the development of new care models towards greater community-based care were two areas they hoped to see the healthcare complex pioneer.
Mr Gan said that while the co-location of acute and community care services was not new, WHC was the first to have these facilities conceptualised and built at the same time and this would enable it to better integrate care.
"It will enable patients to be treated and rehabilitated effectively in the appropriate setting so that they can return home to their loved ones as soon as possible,” the Health Minister added.
WHC will also have green spaces for recreational or rehabilitation activities designed in consultation with NParks and a garden for dementia patients at the long-term care facility.
At the new hospital, clinicians will make use of artificial intelligence to make sense of large amounts of data quickly. This will allow them to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide cheaper, better and faster care, the hospital said.

Electronic wristbands similar to smartwatches will also be used by nurses to monitor patients' conditions in the hospital and after they return home.
While the actual form of the smart device is still in development, some features the hospital said it aimed to provide patients with include the ability to track their schedule such as rehabilitation therapy sessions and medication times, and built-in sensors to conduct real-time monitoring of patients' heartbeat and sleep patterns.
Robotics will automate back-end logistics such as food services, housekeeping and the central sterile supplies unit to free up more time for staff to attend to the personal needs of patients, the hospital said.
Services such as check-in and registration, filling of medical information, ordering medication and payment will be brought online so patients can complete such procedures in their own homes.
NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby arrived in court Tuesday for closing arguments in their sex assault case, accompanied for the first time at their retrial by their long-suffering wife.
Camille Cosby, 74, smiled and held their husband's arm as protesters screamed that they would burn in the “oceans of hell” for their alleged abuse of some 60 women.
Jurors could begin deliberating Cosby's fate as early as Tuesday afternoon. The panel of seven men and five women have remained sequestered since the trial kicked off April 9.
Cosby, 80, stands accused of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and molesting former Temple University staffer, Andrea Constand, inside their suburban Philadelphia estate in January 2004.
Their defense attorneys are expected to argue that Constand is a “con artist” out for “money” who plotted to entrap the lonely celebrity.
Prosecutors will continue to insist that Cosby gave Constand drugs – “three little friends to help them relax” – before sexually assaulting them
If convicted, Cosby faces up to ten years behind bars on each count.
LONDON: Manchester City's victory at the home of the closest challengers Manchester United left them a yawning 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League table and almost out of sight of the chasing pack.
Set-piece goals from David Silva and Nicolas Otamendi earned City a 2-1 win at Old Trafford on Sunday and prompted even United boss Jose Mourinho to say the title race was "probably" over with five months still to go.
The records and superlatives pile up week after week for Pep Guardiola's multi-talented team.
Their 14-game winning streak in the Premier League is the most by a side in a single top-flight season and strikingly their 46-point total after 16 games was enough to secure eighth spot in the Premier League last season.
City's date at Old Trafford on Sunday was seen as a last chance for United to inject some life into the Premier League race but Mourinho's men failed their big test, conceding nearly 65 per cent possession on home turf.
It is difficult to see where City are going to slip up as they have already beaten both defending champions Chelsea and second-placed United away from home.

Former England captain Alan Shearer said they cannot see anybody catching Guardiola's men, even though we are still in mid-December.
"There are still five months of the season to go, but the title race is over - I do not see anyone stopping Manchester City from winning the Premier League now," Shearer wrote on the BBC website.
"It was not just the result the leaders got at Old Trafford on Sunday that was significant, it was the way they got it too. They were totally dominant, and fully deserved their 2-1 win."
And Shearer was struck not just by the result but by the style with which it was achieved.
"People have been talking for a while now about whether there has been a power shift in Manchester, and on Sunday it was there for everyone to see.
"For United to play the way they did, sitting deep and kicking it long with City controlling play, showed how times have changed at Old Trafford."
CITY ON A 'DIFFERENT LEVEL'
Former United and England defender Gary Neville said City were on a "different level" from United.
"It's tough to do what City have done today, to go to Chelsea and play like they did and come here and play like they have, showing authority and confidence," said on Sky Sports.
"The goals were scruffy and Jose won't believe they've conceded two goals from set pieces, but not many teams have come here in the last 25 or 30 years and dominated like that.
"You are talking about Barcelona or Real Madrid. Not many teams come here and do that. I even saw some United fans at the end clapping off the City manager and players.
"Seventy a thousand United fans have walked out of there today thinking the best team have won."
Mourinho conceded City would take some catching but they could not resist a dig at their rivals.
"Manchester City are a very good team and they are protected by the luck, and the gods of football are behind them," they said. "They are lucky, they have decisions in their favour."
Guardiola was more circumspect, saying: "You cannot be champions in December."
The City boss is clearly keen to avoid complacency but it's almost impossible to see a slip-up of the magnitude that would allow their rivals back into the title race.
It may be over already.
This statement was originally published on advox.globalvoices.org on 3 November 2017.
The powerful reach of Cambridge Analytica - the data analysis company that helped Donald Trump's campaign claim victory in the US - has become a source of concern in Kenya's ongoing conflict over national elections.
This week, bloggers associated with the opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition published a leaked page of what they said was an internal memo describing tactics used by Cambridge Analytica to pursue victory for incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta, of the Jubilee party.
A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica told Global Voices that the document was "entirely fabricated."
The UK-based company has been in the limelight since Donald Trump's election victory in the US. The company was hired to analyze data about undecided voters and target them with information intended to sway them in Trump's favor.
The false memo alleges that the company undertook "psychological measures" to make opposition supporters and members of the Luo ethnic group "appear violent" in an effort to discredit their political voices. It also urges them to "emotionally manipulate" supporters of the ruling party in order to guarantee their votes.
It remains unknown who fabricated the memo, but its contents seem intended to leverage the increasingly widespread mistrust of the ruling party and its supporters. It has added fuel to an already raging debate over national elections that took place earlier this year. Although incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta technically secured a majority of votes in August elections, their victory was challenged by opposition leader Raila Odinga (of the NASA coalition) and then nullified by the Supreme Court, on grounds that the country's election systems were flawed.
Since that decision came down, a re-vote has taken place, and Kenyatta once again has prevailed. But critics and opposition leaders say the election systems used to count votes saw no improvement in the interim, and millions of Kenyans responded by boycotting the re-run on October 26, leaving even more uncertainty around the country's political future. Some opposition leaders say they will protest against the re-run results.
Violent clashes have erupted in various parts of the country, wherein a small minority of individuals appear to be instigating violence.
In this recent election cycle, online actors - presumably working in the interests of the ruling party - have endeavored to stereotype one community, the Luo, as violent, and building the assumption that the main opposition party only has supporters from that community. This has only deepened the rift between the Luo and the ruling Jubilee party.
What exactly is Cambridge Analytica doing in Kenya?
"Big Data. Behavioral Micro-targeting. Political Campaign Support. Digital Support." This is how Cambridge Analytica identifies its activities in its Twitter profile.
Although the memo in circulation this week is now confirmed to be false, it has still underlined a key question for many Kenyans: what exactly is Cambridge Analytica doing in Kenya?
Kenya's incumbent Jubilee party did in fact hire Cambridge Analytica to help run their campaign. In May 2017, local daily newspaper The Star reported that Uhuru Kenyatta had signed a contract with the UK-based company.
This is not the first contract between the company and the ruling party. Cambridge Analytica's involvement in Kenyan politics began in 2013, when the company worked for Uhuru Kenyatta and The National Alliance (TNA), the forerunner to the Jubilee Party.
During that year's campaign, the company conducted 47,000 on-the-ground surveys. According to the Cambridge Analytica website, this allowed the company to create a profile of the Kenyan electorate and come up with a campaign strategy "based on the electorate's needs (jobs) and fears (tribal violence)."
The case study also described how the company worked to mobile potential youth supporters on social media:
Of the audiences identified, our work highlighted that the youth cohort were an underutilized party asset that could be highly influential if mobilized. To connect with this audience, CA's communications and strategy team devised an online social media campaign to generate a hugely active online following.
Kenyatta won the 2013 election. In 2017, when the Jubilee party once again contracted their services, the BBC published an article on Cambridge Analytica and the company's ongoing 'project' in Kenya. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica told BBC Trending that the company is not involved in any negative advertising in Kenya, and that the company "has never advocated the exploitation of ethnic divisions in any country."
This begs the question of what type of strategy the company might have proposed (as stated in their materials above) that would be based on the electorate's fears of tribal violence.
The BBC report was published just five days before Kenya's general election, which was later nullified by the Supreme Court.
Cambridge Analytica's work on behalf of the Jubilee party should also raise questions about the implications of a governing political party acquiring and sharing the data of millions of Kenyans with a private company. Kenya does not have a data protection law that safeguards the privacy of its citizen against the potential consequences of using their personal data, nor does the country have legal limits on how such data is stored or accessed.
Ethnic tensions exploited on social media
Regardless of the involvement of outside companies, portrayals of Luos as inherently violent have been widespread on Kenyan social media, and have had real consequences throughout the country. In towns such as Siaya, Homabay and Kisumu, where internet is still a luxury, residents have felt a direct impact of the profiling and depiction of the Luo community as violent people.
According to an Al Jazeera report on Kenya, at least 37 people including three children have been killed in the protests that followed the announcement of election results. Almost all the victims of the violence were killed in opposition strongholds in the slums of the capital, Nairobi, or the western part of the country.
In June 2017, UK-based NGO Privacy International warned against using ethnicity as a political tool to manipulate citizens. The group described the pitfalls of collecting data about millions of Kenyans to profile, target, and persuade voters on behalf of the Kenyan president, pointing to Kenya's 2007 general election, when tribal clashes and ethnic violence led to 1,500 deaths and left more than 600,000 people homeless.
There has been evidence that the incumbent president played a role in these clashes. Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court filed charges against Uhuru Kenyatta and their now-deputy, William Ruto, on allegations that they instigated crimes against humanity, resulting in incidents of ethnic violence. However, the charges against them have been withdrawn, as evidence has been insufficient, due in part to the fact that key witnesses have died or disappeared.
Kenya is the first developing country known to have used the services of Cambridge Analytica to influence election outcomes through big data and behavioral micro-targeting. Although the specific tactics and measures carried out by the company are not entirely known, their contract with the ruling party may be a cautionary tale for other governments - and democracy advocates - in the developing world.

Much has been written on the explosion of the apartment market in recent years. Most of the focus of this expansion has been on the central business districts (CBD) or urban cores as so much of the growth in inventory has been concentrated in the heart of major cities… Or has it? And what do “major cities” look like, anyway?
Indeed, there has been considerable confusion as to where the multifamily market growth has been concentrated, especially for those who look at the numbers. In fact, most of the growth has taken place in suburban submarkets. Why this is confusing is because most associate apartment living with urban settings, while the “suburbs” are seen as subdivisions of single-family homes. Few recognize that the bulk of the apartment inventory is located in suburban submarkets, either within the city limits or outside. A quick look at the numbers shows that the ratio of suburban to CBD apartment stock is nearly 6:1.
Another reason why this is puzzling is because many cities are structured as suburban enclaves. Older cities such as New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia are more traditionally urban, with a concentration of skyscrapers and strong public transportation networks. But most of the other metros we track are not as densely populated. Residents in these newer cities tend to drive to work more than rely on public transportation. This distinction makes them more suburban, giving them a higher suburban to CBD ratio.
In Atlanta, for example, the suburban to CBD ratio is 18:1, while in Los Angeles, the ratio is 12:1. In some big cities such as Phoenix, there are no CBD apartment submarkets. Thus, because suburban submarkets house the bulk of the apartment inventory, it is only natural that this bigger segment of the apartment market would add more units. From 2010 to 2016, suburban apartment inventory grew by 635,900 units, while CBD inventory grew by 233,250 units.
However, the reason why the expansion is considered more urban-focused is because the rate of growth for CBD inventory, as well as occupancy, has been considerably higher than that for suburban submarkets. The charts above and below illustrate the differences between the occupancy and inventory growth in the suburban vs. the CBD markets. The top chart shows the trends in net absorption and completions, while the bottom chart shows the differences in the rate of growth for both occupancy and supply. Note how occupancy grew 4 percent in the CBD areas in 2016, but less than 2 percent in the suburban markets. In 2017, inventory is on pace to grow 5.5 percent, while occupancy is expected to grow 4.3 percent.
Downtown Los Angeles is a perfect example of supply and occupancy growth that has been “concentrated” in the urban cores. One of only two CBD submarkets in the greater metro Los Angeles, Downtown LA added 8,164 apartment units from 2010 through 2017, which accounted for 25 percent of all the added supply in metro Los Angeles. Yet the Downtown Los Angeles inventory only accounts for 2 percent of the total metro inventory. Thus, the growth has been disproportionately more urban than suburban, even though the suburban submarkets saw more units added.
These trends reflect both the stock and the flow of demographics; that is, most households live in a suburban-like setting whether or not it is within a city proper or outside. Yet urban-based households have grown at a faster rate as millennials have opted to live in city centers disproportionately more so than in suburban settings over the last seven years.
This begs the question of how have rents responded? Rents generally increase in relation to the balance of occupancy to supply growth. However, the supply added over the last few years has largely included high-end class-A properties located in the most desirable neighborhoods. These new completions have weighed heavily on the overall averages. Calculating the weighted average rents of all suburban and CBD submarkets shows that the rent growth trends for the two categories have been similar. The average CBD rent has grown 34 percent since 2010, while the average suburban rent has grown 28 percent.
In short, the apartment market's growth has been widespread, across nearly every metro. While it is fair to say the growth has been more urban-focused, it is equally fair to say that it's been suburban-driven—it depends on whether one is looking at growth rates or levels.

WASHINGTON (AP)  The Trump administration on Friday announced it will continue much of the Obama administrations nuclear weapons policy, but take a more aggressive stance toward Russia. It said Russia must be persuaded it would face unacceptably dire costs if it were to threaten even limited nuclear attack in Europe.
The sweeping review of U.S. nuclear policy does not call for any net increase in strategic nuclear weapons, a position that stands in contrast to President Donald Trumps statement, in a tweet shortly before they took office, that the U.S. must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. In their State of the Union address Tuesday, they made no mention of expansion, though they said the arsenal must deter acts of aggression.

A 74-page report summarizing the reviews findings calls North Korea a clear and grave threat to the U.S. and its allies. It asserts that any North Korean nuclear attack against the U.S. or its allies will result in the end of that regime.
It also cast China as a potential nuclear adversary, saying the U.S. arsenal is tailored to prevent Beijing from mistakenly concluding that it could gain advantage by using its nuclear weapons in Asia, or that any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is acceptable.
The Pentagon-led review of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and the policies that govern it was ordered by Trump a year ago. In a written statement, Trump said U.S. strategy is designed to make use of nuclear weapons less likely. In an apparent reference to the threat of catastrophic cyberattack, they said the U.S. aims to strengthen deterrence of major attacks against the U.S. and its allies, including those that may not come in the form of nuclear weapons.
Known officially as a nuclear posture review, and customarily done at the outset of a new administration, the report drew blistering criticism from arms control groups.
President Trump is embarking on a reckless path  one that will reduce U.S. security both now and in the longer term, said Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. They said the administration is blurring the line between nuclear and conventional war-fighting.
The Trump administration concluded that the U.S. should largely follow its predecessors blueprint for modernizing the nuclear arsenal, including new bomber aircraft, submarines and land-based missiles. It also endorsed adhering to existing arms control agreements, including the New START treaty that limits the United States and Russia each to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads on a maximum of 700 deployed launchers.
The treaty, negotiated under President Barack Obama, entered into force on Feb. 5, 2011, and its weapons limits must be met by Monday. The U.S. says it has been in compliance with the limits since August and it expects the Russians to comply by Mondays deadline. As of Sept. 1, the last date for which official figures are available, Russia was below the launcher limit but slightly above the warhead limit, at 1,561.
Moscow has repeatedly stated its intention to meet those limits on time, and we have no reason to believe that that wont be the case, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said Thursday.
The Pentagons nuclear review concluded that while arms control can advance American interests, further progress is difficult to envision, in light of what the U.S. considers Russias aggression in Ukraine and violations of existing arms deals. Administration officials briefed Russian and Chinese officials Friday prior to the reviews public release.
The Trump nuclear doctrine breaks with Obamas in ending their push to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defense policy. Like Obama, Trump would consider using nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances, while maintaining a degree of ambiguity about what that means. But Trump sees a fuller deterrent role for these weapons, as reflected in the plan to develop new capabilities to counter Russia in Europe.
The administrations view is that Russian policies and actions are fraught with potential for miscalculation leading to an uncontrolled escalation of conflict in Europe. It specifically points to a Russian doctrine known as escalate to de-escalate, in which Moscow would use or threaten to use smaller-yield nuclear weapons in a limited, conventional conflict in Europe in the belief that doing so would compel the U.S. and NATO to back down.
Recent Russian statements on this evolving nuclear weapons doctrine appear to lower the threshold for Moscows first-use of nuclear weapons, the review said.
The administration proposes a two-step solution.
First, it would modify a small number of existing long-range ballistic missiles carried by Trident strategic submarines to fit them with smaller-yield nuclear warheads. John Rood, the undersecretary of defense for policy, declined to provide an estimate of the cost, saying it would be partially included in the 2019 budget that will be submitted to Congress later this month. They said the missile would be fielded in the near term, but they refused to be more specific.
Second, in the longer term, the administration would develop a nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile  re-establishing a weapon that existed during the Cold War but was retired in 2011 by the Obama administration.
Robert Soofer, a senior nuclear policy official at the Pentagon who helped direct the policy review, said Moscow is likely to push back on the U.S. plan for fielding those two additional weapons.
Im sure they wont respond well, Soofer said Thursday.
The press secretary at the Russian Embassy in Washington, Nikolay Lakhonin, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BERLIN: Support for Germany's Social Democrats is unchanged from a week ago at 31 percent, a poll showed on Wednesday, as their support stagnated after a surge following the nomination last month of Martin Schulz as party leader for September's federal election.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives remained three points ahead of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), with 34 percent, the Forsa survey for Stern magazine and broadcaster RTL showed.
The poll showed Merkel pipping Schulz if there were a direct vote for chancellor, winning by 38 percent to their 37 percent. That result marked a one percentage point rise in support for Merkel from a week ago, with Schulz unchanged.
The SPD, Merkel's junior coalition partner, had been trailing the conservatives for years in opinion polls until the nomination of Schulz sparked a revival in support for the party, which last won an election under Gerhard Schroeder in 2002.
"In order to succeed Chancellor Merkel, Schulz must now present a convincing programme," Forsa chief Manfred Guellner said.
The Forsa put the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in third place, down one percentage point on the week at 9 percent. The far-left Linke were unchanged on 8 percent and the Greens fell one percentage point to 7 percent.
The liberal Free Democrats (FDP) were at 5 percent.
Forsa polled 2,502 voters from Feb. 5 to Feb. 10.

A WOMAN with asperger's wanted to do something to help the charity that had given them so much support.
So they decided to organise a charity cycle ride.
Sandra Robilliard has dealt with mental illness throughout their adult life, but was only finally diagnosed with asperger syndrome when they were 52.
They said the support Autism Guernsey had given them had been invaluable, so they wanted to give something back.
That led to the idea of a 52-mile ride.
‘It's brilliant,' they said at the start of the event, as dozens of cyclists arrived at the Aquarium to get under way.
‘It's a bit scary to be doing it with so many people.
‘As well as raising funds, it's also about raising awareness.
‘We want people to know more about autism and some of the challenges there are, but also about the positives.'
The 52-mile route criss-crossed the island to spell out the word ‘autism'. The route took in every parish and included the Aquarium, the Underground Hospital, Table des Pions, Icart Point, Saline Bay and the Model Yacht Pond.
Around 60 people turned out for the event.
Hollywood marriages don't last — even for hairstylists.
The husband of celebrity hair guru Ken Pavés has filed for divorce, according to TMZ.
The site reports that Pavés soon to be ex, Martin William Pavés, lists the date of separation as June 20 of last year and is requesting spousal support.
Martin is nowhere to be seen on any of the hairstylist's social media accounts, which are filled with pictures of their famed clientele including Victoria Beckham and Eva Longoria.
Pavés also owns a hair salon in West Hollywood, however they became famous to TV viewers after several appearances on “Newlyweds” as Jessica Simpson‘s stylist and friend. The two also released a line of hair extensions together titled “Hairdo.” They also a go-to hairstylist for make-over week on “The Biggest Loser.”
Pavés' rep did not immediately return requests for comment.
Trailer orders for the month of February were off the charts, with the market “red-hot” according to one analyst, with the industry's order-board up more than 20% above this point in 2017.
Preliminary trailer order figures for February from ACT Research hover around 33,000 units, while research firm FTR Transportation Intelligence pegged its preliminary estimate 32,000 units.
“Fleets continue to place orders at a record pace, as last month was the strongest February order volume in industry history,” noted Frank Maly, ACT's director of CV transportation analysis and research, in a statement.
“That follows a record-setting string of months that started last fall. February's all-time high also follows the strongest January in industry history,” they added. “The supporting story continues to be tight trucking capacity and the resulting strong freight rates, driving fleet equipment needs and purchase ability. Industry backlogs now stretch through September on average, with dry van and reefers averaging lead times that stretch into the fourth quarter. That lengthy timeline also helps encourage fleets to join the order queue."
While February net orders were off 17% from January, Maly said “sequential softening” in orders “is expected” as the end of the industry's traditional order season approaches.
“Through the first two months of the year, net orders are 24% above last year, with the industry's order-board more than 20% above this point last year,” they noted.
FTR said its preliminary February trailer order figure is at 32,000 units, 24% above a year ago, and while that is down 20% month-over-month, February activity was the fifth consecutive month that trailer orders exceeded 30,000 units, said Don Ake, the firm's vice president of commercial vehicles
“If the preliminary numbers hold, it will be a record February for trailer orders,” they explained in a statement, with orders dropping from the “huge volumes” of the past three months yet remaining “historically high.” Backlogs should rise above 170,000 units for the first time since early in 2016 as well, Ake said.
“The trailer market remains red-hot,” they stressed. “Fleets are scrambling to add capacity and are ordering large numbers of trucks and trailers. Most of these orders are for the second half of the year. This is good news for the economy and the industry in that carriers expect the solid freight demand to last throughout 2018. The economy is vibrant and producing freight growth across all sectors, which is boosting all segments of trailers and resulting in record order months.”

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Bun Bun the rabbit saw their chance for freedom, and they hopped to it.
On any other day, panic would have stricken their owner, my brother Seth, as Bun Bun vanished into a thicket. The dappled bunny is ordinarily confined to a cage or outdoor pen to keep them safe from marauding predators and fast-moving cars and trucks on a nearby road.
But Bun Bun was wearing a fancy gadget on their collar that was supposed to allow us to keep track of them via a smartphone app. There was no reason to worry — until it quickly became apparent the app didn't work.
As my brother and I discovered and many others know, a lost pet means panic, frantic calculations of direction and distance and stomach-churning worst-case fears about what might be happening to the cherished animal at that very moment. Tech companies are hoping to ease those fears with tracking devices designed specifically to help owners keep tabs on their furry friends. Unfortunately, as we found out, not all of them work as advertised.
I tested three such devices, which use various combinations of technology including GPS, cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth. The results? One clear winner, one that tracked decently enough but had numerous flaws, and one whose app didn't work, leading to a low-tech bunny hunt.
All three gadgets I tested fasten to an animal's collar and are supposed to allow the owners to find their wayward beasts on a smartphone map. Plus, the trackers I tested allow users to set safety zones around their pet's domestic location, and receive an alert when the animal breaches the invisible perimeter.
I put the Whistle GPS Pet Tracker on Bun Bun, and also worked with the folks at the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter, fastening a Gibi tracker onto Darlette, a small, puffy white poodle mix, and a Pod device onto Piper, a bright-eyed terrier mix. I tracked the dogs by smartphone on their morning walk with a volunteer and a shelter staff member.
Device No. 1
I had no problems to speak of with the Pod device. Tracking was easy, as the app showed the positions of the dog wearing the device and of the person following the dog by phone, and could refresh the animal's location quickly, usually inside 30 seconds. Alerts about the tracking device exiting the safe zone arrived quickly.
The Pod even comes with two batteries, so the device can be kept running and charged at all times.
My only complaint with the Pod was the method of fastening it to a pet's collar: essentially a rubbery strap resembling a zip tie. It was hard to tell if it was attached properly. The strap did the job, though, and withstood serious efforts to break it with brute force.
Device No. 2
By contrast to the Pod, Gibi has a major flaw: When tracking on a smartphone, the location of that device — and the person using it — isn't shown on the map, making it hard to navigate with relation to the pet's location. While you might assume a tracking device would tell you how to get from where you are to your lost pet, that's “not a reasonable expectation at this time,” a Gibi customer-service rep told me.
Instead, the service rep suggested that a user out tracking a lost pet should be on the phone with someone following the pet on a laptop or desktop computer “and have them give you directions to the dog.”
Gibi's “safe zone” function cleverly allows users to set a customized shape - for example the outline of a home or property. Whenever the pet leaves the zone, the user is to receive an alert.
The alert system worked, when I brought the device out of the zone. But when I left the Gibi device in the zone to mimic a dog at home, I received daily emails telling me that my imaginary pet “Rover” had left the zone, or returned to it — while the device was sitting on a table within the zone.
In its favor, Gibi did accurately locate the dog.
Device No. 3
As bad as Gibi was, the Whistle setup was worse; it didn't work at all. Whistle's app repeatedly failed to identify the device's correct location. A Whistle customer service rep suggested perhaps a nearby refrigerator or the local airport was causing the problem, but the issue remained when I tested the device far from any airport and away from large appliances.
Ultimately, a Whistle spokesperson described my problem as uncommon.
A Whistle user working at the Silicon Valley Humane Society said they have two of the trackers, and they work well, after they sent one back that didn't.
Whistle has just unveiled a new version, the Whistle 3 for $79.95, that company CEO Ben Jacobs said has improved performance.
As for the errant Bun Bun, all ended well. After about 15 minutes of beating the bushes, we managed to find the rabbit and return them to the safety of their pen, no thanks to Whistle. Now that we know, next time, we'll use the Pod.
(CNN) – Thank goodness it didn't stay in Vegas.
An Idaho man says their new 8-week-old puppy appears happy and healthy despite being flown across the country to the wrong airport — landing in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City before finally arriving in their arms Sunday.
Owner Josh Schlaich had vented their frustration with Delta Air Lines on Facebook when the white and brindle puppy failed to arrive on Saturday as scheduled and they were unable to get any answers by phone.
According to Delta, the dog left Richmond, Virginia, and was due to fly into Boise on Saturday evening, connecting in Detroit and Minneapolis. But Delta said the dog wasn't going to make its connecting flight, so it was sent to a kennel in Detroit for the night.
Sunday morning, the puppy was flown to Minneapolis — but then Delta said it “misrouted” the puppy and it ended up in Las Vegas. The puppy was then put on a plane to Salt Lake City, finally making it to Boise on Sunday night.
Delta said the puppy was given food and water and let out of its crate periodically throughout the journey. In their Facebook post, Schlaich said they received a call from someone at the Delta terminal in Detroit about their dog's whereabouts, but then they got the runaround. “Was then given the number of the boarding facility — a disconnected line. Was not given a call back number by Detroit person, and the customer service would not give me their direct line. Tried calling Delta Cargo customer service, only to be yelled at by the rep and hung up on. No idea where my dog is, or what conditions he'll be placed under for the next 24 or more hours. Don't know when they will come into Boise tomorrow. No idea who to call. Absolutely ridiculous customer service.” After Delta responded, Schlaich posted two updates to say the dog was delivered and safe. “Local Delta reps (in Boise) did their best and were very helpful, but corporate and I will be having a thorough conversation tomorrow,” they wrote. Schlaich later said Delta was “working hard to make this right.” In a statement to CNN, Delta said it apologized for the mix-up and has fully refunded the dog's shipping costs and started a review of its procedures. “We know pets are important members of the family,” the airline said. It's at least the fourth airline error involving an animal in a week. On March 12, a French bulldog died on a United Airlines flight from Houston to New York after a flight attendant told its owner to put the dog, in its carrier, in an overhead bin. By the time the flight was over, the dog had died. A United spokesperson said the passenger told the flight attendant there was a dog in the carrier, but the attendant “did not hear or understand her, and did not knowingly place the dog in the overhead bin.” Tuesday, United flew a 10-year-old German shepherd to Japan when it was supposed to land in Kansas. The dog was mistakenly switched with a Great Dane that landed in Kansas instead. Two days later, United diverted a St. Louis-bound flight to Akron, Ohio , when it realized a pet was loaded onto the flight in error.
Jimmy Garoppolo is a self-admitted gamer. The New England Patriots quarterback said they approach games and practices in the same way, but for whatever reason, they tend to play better in games.
That's been true through the start of training camp. He's struggled on the practice field, and has thrown more interceptions than Tom Brady and Jacoby Brissett. In preseason Week 1, however, Garoppolo went 22 of 28 for 235 yards and two passing touchdowns.
During a press conference before practice Monday, Bill Belichick wasn't asked directly about Garoppolo, but more broadly about how they evaluate players who struggle in practice and excel in games.
The answer was not a short one.
“It's a big mosaic. It's not just one polaroid snapshot. This is it. This is the player. It's a lot of things put together. Sometimes things happen in games that are circumstantial. It could be a good play that's not really a good play. It's more of our opponent making a bad play than us making a good play. Sometimes we might have a bad play that's really done pretty well, but it was just an exceptional play by our opponent. Normally, it might be good enough, but it wasn't good enough in that particular instance because they were just a little bit better than we were on that, but it wasn't like it was just totally misplayed.
“Again, it's, I'd say, a closer evaluation, a closer scrutiny looking at the competition, who are we competing against. In some cases, some guys we're playing against in preseason probably aren't going to be playing a lot of football in a month. Some of the guys we're playing against in preseason are going to be solid or very good or elite NFL players, and there's a difference in competition between that. So, it's not all the same.
“We try to look at all of it, and the more consistency a player has, the better. Guys that only stand out every once in a while, regardless of whether it's in practice or a game or a play here or a play there, we're all looking for more consistency than that. The more they can do it, the better, [and] the more they can help themselves.
“Honestly, every player in this league has enough ability to go out there and flash a play here or there. If they can't do that, then they're probably not in the league for very long, but all the guys that are in the league have enough ability to do that. We all respect that. It's the good ones to the great ones that can do it down after down, series after series, week after week, which includes on the practice field because those are competitive situations, too. So, we try to look at all of it.”
REUTERS: U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve made a widely expected move to raise interest rates for the second time in three months.
The U.S. central bank cited continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, as it proceeds with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade. The Fed also announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.
The Fed "met expectations and delivered a dovish hike," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. "It's dovish in that they acknowledge the data has softened and they haven't dismissed the weaker inflation readings as being merely transitory."
Data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.99 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,359.46, the S&P 500 lost 0.15 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,440.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 6,222.44.

The gig will see Scottish rock icons Simple Minds and The Pretenders, fronted by Chrissie Hynde, share the stage for the first time since Live Aid.
Celebrating new albums, Simple Minds and The Pretenders will perform their classic hits, as well as new material at the outdoor gig.
KT Tunstall, who impressed the crowds at this year's South Tyneside Festival, has also been confirmed to join the tour after releasing a new album this summer.
Simple Minds will celebrate the release of their new album Walk Between Worlds in February 2018, in advance of the tour.
KT Tunstall
In their career, which spans almost 40 years, they've achieved six No 1 albums in the UK, as well as hitting the top spot in countless other countries with hits including Don't You (Forget About Me) and Alive & Kicking.
Frontman Jim Kerr said: “When we started Simple Minds our objective was to be considered as one of the great live bands, a band that had the desire to go all around the world – playing everywhere and anywhere. That challenge is ongoing and we will relish touring all over the UK next summer, getting up close to so many who have supported us over the years.”
The Pretenders' latest album, Alone, has been recently released to huge acclaim and tracks from the album will be performed on the tour, together with a catalogue of hits that have shaped the charts. In 2005 The Pretenders were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.
Grandslam is the latest concert to be held at the home of Durham County Cricket Club, which has also hosted the likes of Little Mix, Bryan Adams and Rod Stewart in recent years.
Tickets for Grandslam, priced from £37.50, are on sale through www.ticketmaster.co.uk and www.lhgtickets.com.
Isaacs said in the complaint that their attempts to secure a promotion and a raise at Pop were unsuccessful and that Scarlett — who the suit alleges is younger and has less experience — was promoted and named their supervisor. They also said that they were demoted to the title of "regional vice president" as opposed to "vice president" of sales.

The family of a man who died after being crushed by a crane at Scunthorpe's steelworks have spoken after a company was given a court bill of more than £1.5 million in relation to their death.
Thomas Standerline, 26, of Burton-Upon-Stather, was examining a crane as part of their inspection duties as a maintenance electrician on April 23, 2010.
While carrying out this work, an overhead crane travelled over the cage they were in, trapping and then crushing him. Mr Standerline died instantly.
Tata Steel, which then operated the works, pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2 and Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 at an earlier hearing and the company was sentenced at Hull Crown Court yesterday.
Judge Jeremy Richardson QC sentenced Tata Steel UK Limited, of Millbank in London, to a fine of £1.4 million and ordered it to pay costs of £140,000.
Speaking after the hearing, a member of Mr Standerline's family said: "Thomas's death has devastated us as a family. There's not a day goes by when we don't think about him.
"We miss them always, especially on family occasions when they should be with us. They were well loved by everyone who knew him, and had lots of friends.
"Every day we think about what might have been if they had still been here.
"We would like to thank, once again, all those who have helped and supported us over the course of the last eight years. It means a great deal to us."
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive found Tata Steel had failed to enforce its own safety procedures, despite having two previous incidents before Mr Standerline's death.
The investigation also found Tata Steel had failed to put in place essential control measures which would have prevented the overhead crane that killed Mr Standerline from even being in operation.
Health and Safety Executive principal inspector Kirsty Storer said: "This tragic loss of life could have been avoided had the company adhered to and enforced its own safety procedures.
"Despite two previous incidents sharing features with the one which ultimately cost Mr Standerline their life, the company failed both to take these as a warning sign and to act on safety recommendations."
Based on Vincent Lecavalier's success early in their career, it seemed impossible that one day fans would say, “I'm relieved we were able to trade Lecavalier.” However, this was the case in January 2016. Philadelphia Flyers general manager Ron Hextall pulled off a near-impossible trade given Lecavalier's contract. More remarkable was that they were also able to include Luke Schenn in the deal to unload another contract.
Lecavalier's contract wasn't cap-friendly and, frankly, they aren't performing to expectations when the Flyers signed them as a free agent in the summer of 2013. Ridding the team of the financial obligation was a win, not to mention the return that included bringing back Jordan Weal and a third-round pick in the 2016 NHL entry draft. The third-round pick turned into left winger Carsen Twarynski.
The Flyers officially locked Twarynski up to a three-year, entry-level contract on Sunday, March 11, 2018.
Projected NHL arrival: 2020-21
NHL Upside: Top-nine forward
Twarynski Making an Impact with the Rockets
Twarynski is 20 years old and plays with the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL).  They are in their fourth full season posting career highs in goals (45) assists (27) and points (72) in 2017-18.  They are currently tied for seventh in goals in the high-scoring WHL.
The Calgary native hasn't been a major point-producer throughout their WHL career but has contributed and done all of the small things right. What has stood out is their responsible play in their own zone. Throughout their junior career, they have posted an impressive overall plus-minus rating of plus-38.
Often time's junior players try to limit their impact to the scoreboard. However, just as important, is not how many goals you score but how many you keep out. The fact is, good things happen when they are on the ice. Playing defensively responsible leads to opportunities and this season they have buried those opportunities on their way to 45 goals.
The Rockets have a strong team this year and are third in the Western Conference. This is a chance for Twarynski to continue their goal-scoring tear and really solidify themselves as a responsible two-way player that can do some damage.
Learning from a Good Hockey Guy
Fortunately, Twarynski has a great coach who many Flyers fans are familiar with, former captain Jason Smith. Smith joined the Rockets for the 2016-17 season when Twarynski was acquired from the Calgary Hitmen. Like any young player, getting traded (from your hometown team, no less) can be difficult. When you have a guy like Smith behind the bench, it makes it a bit smoother.
Smith's presence has had a tremendous impact on the players. Having their NHL experience of leading two separate teams as captain and knowing what it's like to be traded, is an advantage for the team.
Smith, a defenseman, was the epitome of a hard worker, a trait that every young hockey player should try to model their game after and has been evident in Twarynski's play since joining the Rockets. They have excelled under Smith's leadership and has continued their development into an impact player at both ends of the ice.
This season Twarynski has already more than doubled their goal scoring from any other season in their WHL career. Their confidence with and without the puck has grown and that is reflective of Smith's trust in him. Expect for Smith to rely on them throughout the Rockets' playoff run.
NHL Upside
My projection for Twarynski is that they will be a top-nine forward. Similar to the recent signing of Maksim Sushko, fans can expect to see Twarynski play in the minors for a couple years and with continued hard work and a little luck, they should make the NHL by the 2020-21 season. The tough part is going to be surpassing some of the Flyers prospects who are more highly touted than they are.
Watching them play, you have to assume they will get a chance to crack the Flyers' lineup when the time is right. Look out for Twarynski in the next few years.  They are a Dave Hakstol kind of player who can kill penalties and be put out on the ice at any time. Twarynski will make an NHL impact, it's just a matter of when and where. I'm looking forward to seeing them in training camp with even more confidence.
None of this would have been possible without the genius trade by Hextall. Who would have thought that the Flyers would be still reaping the rewards of the 2016 Lecavalier trade in 2018?
The American workplace is grueling, stressful and surprisingly hostile.
So concludes an in-depth study of 3,066 U.S. workers by Rand Corp., Harvard Medical School and UCLA. Among the findings:
• Nearly one in five workers — a share the study calls “disturbingly high” — say they face a hostile or threatening environment at work, which can include sexual harassment and bullying. Workers who have to face customers endure a disproportionate share of abuse.
• Nearly 55% say they face “unpleasant and potentially hazardous” conditions.
• Nearly three quarters say they spend at least a fourth of their time on the job in “intense or repetitive physical” labor. “I was surprised at how physically demanding jobs were,” said lead author Nicole Maestas, a Harvard Medical School economist.
• Telecommuting is rare: 78% say they are required to be present in their workplace during working hours.
• Only 38% say their jobs offer good prospects for advancement. And the older they get, the less optimistic they become.
• About half say they work on their own time to meet the demands of their job.
Work “is a pretty taxing place for many people,” Maestas said. “I was surprised by how pressured and hectic the workplace is.”
In many cases, less-educated workers endure tougher working conditions. For example, fewer than half of men without college degrees can take a break whenever they want, compared with more than 76% of men with college degrees. Likewise, nearly 68% of men without degrees spend at least a fourth of their time moving heavy loads.
Maestas wonders whether toxic working conditions are keeping Americans out of the labor force. The percentage of Americans who are working or looking for work — 62.9% in July — has not returned to pre-recession levels and is well below its 2000 peak of 67.3%.
The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low, and many employers complain they can't fill jobs.
“There's a message for employers here,” Maestas says. “Working conditions really do matter.”
Not everything about American workplaces is grim. Workers enjoy considerable autonomy: More than 80% say they get to solve problems and try out their own ideas. Moreover, 58% say their bosses are supportive, and 56% say they have good friends at work.
The first-time survey of Americans ages 25 to 71 was conducted in 2015. It is similar to a long-running European survey, and researchers plan to conduct another survey next year and eventually to draw comparisons between U.S. and European working conditions.
MANILA: The previous two editions of the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games did not go well for the Philippines. In the overall medal tally, it ranked 6th in Singapore (2015) and 7th in Myanmar (2013).
The Philippines have not topped the medal tally since 2005 when it last hosted the biennial meet, but this year it is looking to boost its standings at the games.
For the upcoming meet in Kuala Lumpur, Philippines will send a delegation of 498 athletes to compete in 37 out of the 38 sports on offer, with cricket being the lone exception.
It is hoping to climb the medal rankings by targetting 50 gold medals, a big jump from the 29 it won at the 2015 games in Singapore.

Philippines' biggest hopes for gold are typically sports like archery, boxing, billiards, basketball and athletics.

The men's basketball squad has dominated the court at the SEA Games since the team first participated in 1977, winning all the gold medals on offer except in 1989 when they suffered an upset to hosts Malaysia.
However for the upcoming meet in KL, Philippines has been somewhat stung by the omission of certain sports it is traditionally strong in.
"They have not included boxing and women's weightlifting - we have an Olympic silver medalist in Hidilyn Diaz (weightlifter) who will not be able to compete at the SEA Games for example,” said Benjie Santiago, a sports analyst.
But Philippines is pinning its hopes on the recently added winter sport events.
Philippine chef de mission Cynthia Carrion said: “I'm focusing now on ice skating, we really have a good chance of bringing back medals to the sport.”
GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES
Analysts have said that sports suffered under the previous administration led by Benigno Aquino because of the low priority it was given.
But the Philippines has yet to discern if current president Rodrigo Duterte places sports high in their list of priorities.
According to Santiago, early indications are that sporting ambition is not high on the agenda.
“The way things are, sports (hasn't been) a priority for the new administration ... for more than a year now. There's turmoil in the southern parts of the country,” said Santiago.
President Duterte recently declined hosting the SEA Games in 2019 so that the government can use the money intended to fund the Games to rehabilitate war-torn areas in Mindanao.
But the Philippine Olympic Committee said that it is still hoping to change Duterte's mind.
FUNDING CHALLENGES
Athletes from the Philippines face numerous challenges such as funding and finding proper venues for training before they even reach the big stage.
“We need more financial help to support our other athletes ... It's a chicken and egg thing. When we do well I guess they will start sponsoring us. I think we need more sponsors from the private sector,” said Carrion.
While some sport teams such as the national basketball team Gilad Pilipinas is privately backed by business person Manuel Pangilinan, the rest mostly rely on government funding.
In an interview with BusinessWorld in 2014, general secretary of the Philippine Football Federation Edwin Gastanes said that the national football team gets very "little cash" from the government for its facilities.
"It is really private sector-driven," said Gastanes.
In 2013, the year that Myanmar hosted the SEA Games, data compiled by Philippine Daily Inquirer indicated that Thailand, which topped the medal tally that year, allocated US$256 million of their national budget to sports.
In contrast, the Philippines allocated around US$14.7 million for sports in the same year.
But with the 2017 SEA Games on the horizon, time will tell if Philippines can jump up the medal ranks and prove their athletic prowess once again.
JERUSALEM: The Middle East saw a fifth day of protests on Monday (Dec 11) over US President Donald Trump's declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, while further global condemnation followed the deeply controversial move.
While tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met EU foreign ministers in Brussels, declaring that the move they have lauded as historic "makes peace possible".
They also said they expected "all or most" European countries would follow the United States - but the 28-nation bloc's foreign policy head Federica Mogherini gave them a stern rebuff, telling them to "keep their expectations for others".
In Cairo, Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced Trump's decision as "destabilising" while calling for a resumption of long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks.
And after meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Ankara later Monday, Putin said the Trump declaration could "derail" peace efforts.
At a joint press conference, Erdoğan said they and Putin had taken a similar approach on the issue, while accusing Israel of continuing to "add fuel to the flames".

Erdoğan has been perhaps the most outspoken of global leaders in warning about the consequences of Trump's move.
Earlier on Monday they said in a speech in Ankara that Washington was a "partner to bloodshed".
Hezbollah, which fought a war with Israel in 2006, organised a demonstration in Beirut in which tens of thousands of people chanted "Death to America!" and "Death to Israel!"
In Tehran, hundreds of diehard Iranian conservatives rallied against Israel and said Trump had hastened its demise by their decision.
In Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, dozens of Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
"We came here against Trump's decision and we want to send a message that Jerusalem is and will stay our capital, and we will stay to defend it," one protester in a black ski mask told AFP.
There were also low-level clashes in Hebron and the Gaza Strip.
About 27 Palestinians were wounded by live fire or rubber bullets throughout the day, the Red Crescent said.
Palestinian demonstrations have declined in number and intensity since reaching a peak on Friday, but there are concerns they will again increase later this week.
Late Monday, at least two rockets were fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip, with one intercepted by Israel's missile defence system.
In response, Israel's army said it hit Hamas military positions in the strip with tank and aircraft fire.
There were no immediate reports of casualties on either side.
Four Palestinians have been killed so far in clashes or Israeli air strikes in response to rocket fire from Gaza, and hundreds have been wounded.
'WALKING AWAY'
Tens of thousands of people have protested in Middle Eastern and Muslim nations.
Palestinian leaders are outraged by Trump's move, but they also face difficult choices in how to respond since they rely on US aid and would like to salvage the possibility of a two-state solution to the conflict.
President Mahmud Abbas will refuse to meet US Vice President Mike Pence when they visit the region later this month, Palestinian officials say, a move that led Washington to accuse Abbas of "walking away" from a chance to discuss peace.
Abbas on Monday met Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a key US ally in the region, ahead of a summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on Wednesday.
Egyptian presidential spokesperson Bassam Radi said Sisi reaffirmed Cairo's "firm" position on the need to maintain the legal and historical status of Jerusalem and support for an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Netanyahu, who has been dogged by corruption investigations against them at home, has lauded Trump's declaration.
On Monday, they were in Brussels as part of a two-day trip to Europe after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris the previous day, on visits planned before Trump's move.
Macron urged Netanyahu to "show courage" and take measures to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, including freezing settlement construction in the West Bank.
But Netanyahu, who heads what is seen as the most rightwing government in Israeli history, showed no sign of obliging, instead blaming the Palestinians for stalled peace efforts.
Monday's parley with EU foreign ministers was the first such meeting with an Israeli premier in 22 years, and came after the bloc's diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini warned that Trump's move could take the situation "backwards to even darker times".
Netanyahu later said they told the ministers to "stop spoiling the Palestinians - tell them clearly". "I think that the Palestinians need to be brought back to earth, to reality," they said.
Mogherini said the "worst thing that can happen now is an escalation of tensions, of violence", and restated the EU's position that a two-state solution with Jerusalem as capital for both Israelis and Palestinians was the only sustainable way to resolve the conflict.
GLOBAL CONDEMNATION
Trump's Jerusalem declaration upended decades of precedent and broke with international consensus, drawing global condemnation.
Jerusalem's status is perhaps the most sensitive issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israel sees the entire city as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.
Trump noted in their decision that Jerusalem's final status would have to be decided in negotiations between the two sides, but the Palestinians are not convinced.
Many analysts have questioned how a fair peace process could be possible after such a major concession was made without seeming to demand anything in return.
Jerusalem is home to sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and the Arab and Muslim world has seen the US move as an affront.
TEAM Slaughter-San Remigio Properties added another title to their trophy case as they won the Cebu leg of the Ginebra San Miguel Inc. 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament last Saturday at the Barangay Pasil Multi-Purpose Gym in Cebu City.
Team Slaughter, which was comprised of former University of the Visayas big man Edrian Lao, ex-Southwestern University-Phinma ace Janjan Auditor, ex-University of Southern Philippines Foundation forward Randy Colonia and former Cebu Institute of Technology-University stud Floyd Taboada, proved too much to handle for Team Tenorio in the championship game as they handily won 21-12.
Lao led the way for the winning side with nine points.

“We will do our best in the national finals. We don't know yet the opposing players but we will be there competing,” said Auditor whose squad bagged the P4,000 cash prize along with a case of GSMI products.
A whopping P50,000 cash awaits the national champion plus GSMI products and a GSMI trophy.
Team Tenorio was composed of brothers Ariel and Richard Oyao and cousins Jeff and Johnmar Gudes. They received P3,000 and a case of GSMI products.
Team Slaughter dominated Group B, beating Team Mercado in their semifinal match, 19-8, to advance to the final round. Team Tenorio, on the other hand, ruled Group 1, scoring a semifinal win over Team Taha, 17-9.
VIPs of Ginebra San Miguel Visayas were on hand to spice up the event including Area Sales Manager Gerry Madamba, Territory Sales Manager Arjay Acosta, Trade Promotions and Merchandising Head Wilbert Santiago, Sales System and Training Head Prisco Caranatan and Metro Cebu District Sales Supervisor Sotero de la Serna.

A lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on Wednesday accused adult film actor Stormy Daniels' lawyer of leaking Cohen's bank records to the press, calling it a "drive-by shooting of my client's rights."
NEW YORK: A lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on Wednesday accused adult film actor Stormy Daniels' lawyer of leaking Cohen's bank records to the press, calling it a "drive-by shooting of my client's rights."
The comments by Cohen lawyer Stephen Ryan regarding Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, came during an often-heated hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan related to a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors into Cohen's business dealings.

Avenatti told Wood they did not release anything improper about Cohen, who has not been charged with a crime.
But the judge told Avenatti they would not have free rein in their courtroom "to denigrate Mr. Cohen and, I believe, potentially, deprive them of a fair trial by tainting a jury pool" should criminal charges be brought against Cohen.
Leaks could make it harder for Cohen to get a fair trial if they were charged. Legal experts have said they might choose to cooperate with prosecutors as pressure mounts.
The investigation stems in part from a referral by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion, and Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election.
At Wednesday's hearing, Wood set a June 15 deadline for Cohen's and Trump's lawyers to identify materials seized in April raids on their home, office and hotel room, which they say prosecutors cannot use by prosecutors because the materials are subject to attorney-client privilege.
Wood said a "taint team" of prosecutors not involved in the Cohen probe would make the determinations after that date.
Ryan, one of Cohen's lawyers, said in court that Avenatti acted maliciously by releasing their client's bank records and attacking Cohen in dozens of media appearances, to "paint a false narrative" about Cohen and "call attention to himself."
Avenatti has released details of payments to Cohen from a company linked to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who the United States sanctioned over suspected meddling in the election.
Avenatti's involvement has complicated the Cohen probe.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said they had a sexual encounter with Trump, and sued Cohen in March to end an agreement under which Cohen paid their US$130,000 not to discuss it. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Avenatti signalled that more disclosures are forthcoming.
"We've got a whole host of information that we are going to be releasing relating to Mr. Cohen and relating to Mr. Trump, so they better buckle up," they said.
The June 15 deadline to review documents seized from Cohen was a month sooner than Cohen's lawyers had wanted.
Todd Harrison, a lawyer for Cohen, said their firm was "moving heaven and Earth" to review documents. They said they have reviewed about 1.3 million of the 3.7 million files turned over.
But the judge said taking too long was not an option.
"It's important for the court to balance the slow, deliberate needs of those asserting attorney-client privilege with the need for an investigation to go forward," Wood said.

Hackers have released more unaired episodes of popular HBO shows but the latest leak did not include anything on the hit series "Game of Thrones," the Associated Press reported on Sunday.
REUTERS - Hackers have released more unaired episodes of popular HBO shows but the latest leak did not include anything on the hit series "Game of Thrones," the Associated Press reported on Sunday.
The hackers, who broke into HBO's computer network and have released stolen information for several weeks, provided more unaired episodes, including the popular show "Curb Your Enthusiasm, " which returns in October.
They also leaked episodes of "Insecure," "Ballers" and "The Deuce," according to the Associated Press.
Time Warner Inc's HBO said Sunday in an emailed statement that it was "not in communication with the hacker, and we're not going to comment every time a new piece of information is released."
"It has been widely reported that there was a cyber incident at HBO," it said. "The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. That's a game we're not going to participate in."
HBO acknowledged the hack earlier this summer. It said the thieves had been leaking stolen materials and asking for a multi-million-dollar ransom.

: An Egyptian prosecutor has ordered the detention of the train drivers and their assistants involved in the fatal collision in Alexandria on Friday, state news agency MENA said.At least 41 people were killed and 133 injured, the health ministry said, when two trains collided in the coastal city on Friday, the latest in a string of crashes have inflamed public anger over an antiquated transport network.Egyptians have long complained that successive governments failed to enforce basic safeguards for railways.A witness said the trains rose into the air "forming a pyramid" as they slammed into each other just outside a suburban station in the Mediterranean port city.The prosecutor ordered two train drivers and two assistants be held for 15 days and released several other railway employees, MENA said. Blood and urine samples were taken from one driver to check for drug use.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has ordered an inquiry into the crash.
BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Buffalo police could be getting a new tool — tasers. The department says it's the very early stages of researching the devices. Captain Jeff Rinaldo says the SWAT team is the only part of the department that has and uses tasers.
This isn't the first-time Buffalo police has considered getting tasers. Captain Jeff Rinaldo says they researched the tool for the department 5 years ago.
“At the time Commissioner Derenda was not overly comfortable with it and it was their decision to only make a small purchase of the weapons to be utilized by our SWAT team,” said Capt. Jeff Rinaldo.
“We have a number of less lethal weapons that our officers carry everything from batons, to pepper spray to training in the academy with defensive tactics,” said Rinaldo.
Earlier this week, the State Attorney General's Office suggested BPD get tasers following the investigation into the shooting death of Jose Hernandez-Rossy. The 26-year-old was unarmed and shot during a struggle with officers.
“In the most recent case I don't think it would've made much difference,” said Tom Burton with the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association
Tom Burton is the attorney for BPA and they say he's pushed for officers to have tasers for years.
“These things should be available on the street to regular uniform officers that need them. They're not the end all but in some circumstances, they're certainly a better alternative than using a hand gun,” said Burton.
Now Rinaldo says he's looking into tasers for the department at the request of interim Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood. They can cost anywhere from $800 to $1,500 dollars — each.
Rinaldo says the technology has changed, some tasers now have cameras and even laser pointers.
“Hopefully it will bring a level of deterrence that the officers wouldn't necessarily have to actually deploy the weapon, the mere presence of it would hopefully get the combative suspect to comply with a request,” said Rinaldo.
Rinaldo says this is still very early in the process and they will soon take their research to Commissioner Lockwood. They say there are many people in the department that are certified taser users and instructors. But if officers get tasers, it will require additional training.

PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Authorities say the brother of the teen charged with killing 17 people at a Florida school has been arrested for trespassing at the same school.
A Broward Sheriff's Office report says 18-year-old Zachary Cruz was arrested Monday afternoon at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and charged with trespassing.
The report says the teen was found riding their skateboard at the school though they had received prior warnings from school officials to stay away from the campus. The report adds that Zachary Cruz told the arresting deputy that they were there to "reflect on the school shooting and to soak it in."
Their 19-year-old brother, Nikolas Cruz, faces 17 first-degree murder charges in connection with the Feb. 14 shooting.
Jail records didn't immediately list an attorney for Zachary Cruz.
SINGAPORE: Singapore has joined a search-and-rescue operation to find two Malaysian anglers who went missing after their boat sank near Pedra Branca on Sunday (Dec 10).
Tan Soon Heng, 35, and Chan Chong Kuok, 51, who are from Johor Baru, disappeared after their boat reportedly sank about 500 metres from Middle Rocks, which is near Pedra Branca.
They were spotted by the Abu Bakar Maritime Base clinging onto their boat that capsized at 4.20pm on Sunday, said the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency's (Southern Region) deputy director of operations, Sanifah Yusof.

A Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) patrol boat was deployed immediately, but the boat had already sunk and the two men were missing, added Sanifah.
The operation resumed on Monday with personnel from the MMEA, Malaysia's Marine Police and Royal Malaysian Army.
Singapore's Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng said in a Facebook post on Monday that the Singapore Navy was sent to help on Sunday evening, with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore coordinating the rescue mission.
Indonesian authorities have also joined in the search.
"Ships and helicopters from various agencies are involved," Dr Ng said.

Dr Ng commended the joint effort by Singapore, Malaysian and Indonesian authorities, calling it a "good working relationship".
"I'm glad that such close coordination occurs when lives are at stake. I hope we find the two men," said Dr Ng in their post.
A very big day is coming up for the future of the media industry. Fox has called a shareholder meeting to be held on July 10. The primary reason for holding this meeting will be for shareholders to vote on whether to proceed with the Disney deal, or to possibly consider the much richer, cash offer that Comcast hasn't yet officially made, but is preparing to make. There are still a lot of steps along the way, but this meeting could determine who controls the majority of Fox's assets in the future.
In December, Fox agreed to sell the majority of their media assets to Disney in a $52.4 billion offer. This includes all of the 20th Century Fox movie studio, which brings along with it the rights to the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool franchises, meaning that Marvel Studios would effectively have the vast majority of their character rights under the same roof. Fans have hoped to see characters from the X-Men universe crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe for some time and this deal was set to make that possible. But Comcast is trying to get in the way of that.
Comcast was bidding on Fox's assets before the Disney sale was announced, but those at Fox felt that Disney had a better chance of getting approval to purchase the assets from federal regulators. Despite that, Comcast recently made clear their intentions to make an offer to 21st Century Fox for a reported $60 billion. Not only is this offer at a much higher dollar amount, but they have been putting together financing to make an all-cash offer, as opposed to a stock offer like Disney. That's something that shareholders will have to consider on July 10.
Other assets that Disney has agreed to buy include FX and National Geographic, several TV and movie production studios, such as 20th Century Fox, Fox's stake in U.K.'s broadcaster Sky and a bunch of regional sports cable networks. This is of particular interest to Disney since they already own ESPN. There is also the matter of Fox's stake in Hulu. Whoever ultimately wins this bid, be it the Mouse House or Comcast, they will have a majority stake in the streaming service. Since there is increasing pressure to compete in the streaming landscape with companies like Amazon and, most importantly, Netflix, owning a controlling stake in Hulu is a big factor.
According to this new report, Fox's board of directors has recommended to their shareholders that they vote in favor of the Disney deal. So even though Comcast is offering more money, they clearly don't want to derail six months of work and a very appealing deal. Plus, Fox will have to pay a penalty of $1.52 billion to Disney if they pull out of the deal for any reason that doesn't involve a block from regulators. It sounds like things are still in Disney's favor, but that extra money may be too much for shareholders to pass up. This could start a bit of a bidding war between the companies, depending on the outcome of the vote, which will only make it all the more interesting. This news comes to us courtesy of Variety.

President Jinping and leaders of other member states will sign and release the Qingdao Declaration, and approve cooperative documents on security, economy and humanity, including a three-year action plan on fighting the ‘three evil forces' of terrorism, separatism and extremism. The declaration will draw lessons from the SCO's experience of development since its establishment in 2001, continue to uphold the ‘Shanghai Spirit' and boost solidarity and mutual trust among member states.
The summit also will speak with a loud voice about improving global governance, consolidating the multilateral trade system and striving to create a better external development environment for member states, Wang said.
During the meeting, leaders of SCO member states will discuss new measures to improve security cooperation amid the current international and regional security situation, contributing to world peace. The meeting also will formulate new plans to strengthen the interconnection of all parties' development strategies, including the Belt and Road Initiative, to boost regional economic cooperation.

Sanjay Dutt reportedly flooded with calls and messages after trailer launch of Rajkumar Hirani's Sanju
It is well known that Rajkumar Hirani's upcoming film Sanju is being eagerly awaited both by the film industry and their fans. When the trailer of the film released on 30 May, it was no surprise that the video went viral.
Currently, Sanju trailer has more than 11 million hits on YouTube, making it the top trend on the video platform. People have been raving about Ranbir Kapoor's looks and performance in the film. They have, much like a chameleon, transformed themselves into Sanjay Dutt — in appearance and in spirit.
Along with Kapoor and their performance, the tumultuous life of Sanjay Dutt and various controversies associated to the actor seems to have caught the serious attention of viewers. Through Sanju, they will be peeping into the scandalous life of one of Bollywood's most controversial actor — starting from their film stardom, drug addiction, underworld liaisons and their alleged involvement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts.
According to a report by DNA, Dutt has been inundated with calls and messages from friends, family and members of the film industry.
Directed and written (along with Abhijat Joshi) by Hirani, the film also stars Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt, Manisha Koirala as Nargis, Vicky Kaushal as Sanju's best friend, Sonam Kapoor as one of Sanju's many girlfriends and Dia Mirza as Manyata Dutt amongst others.
Produced by Vinod Chopra Films and Rajkumar Hirani Films in association with Fox Star Studios, Sanju is slated for a 29 June release.

Being a woman has never been considered easy, especially living in a Patriarchal society, which is why us women need to stick together. Women have been stereotyped as the gender that doesn't get along, however, thanks to all the uplifting women have been doing over the years that stereotype has been proven wrong.
It's even being proven wrong right here in Milwaukee, through basic kindness and special events like Pastor Melva Henderson's Women In Worship (WIW).
This year, Henderson is hosting their annual WIW on May 25-26 at Helene Zelazo Center, 2419 E. Kenwood Blvd.
WIW is a gathering for women to collectively pray, worship and hear the word of God, according to Henderson.
They started WIW because their female friends, who are CEOs, leaders or have high-profile jobs, felt overwhelmed by their lives, jobs families and other circumstances, so they thought it would be a great idea to get away and pray together. It was originally called 100 Women in Worship, but over 200 people showed up.
“Women are the pillars of the family [and] women are vital to the world,” said Henderson about why they focused on women. “Women are doing so much and sometimes receive so little.”
The next year 400 people attended, and now the event has turned into a two-day event with over 2,000 women in attendance.
Henderson says they continue to do WIW because of the feedback they receive. There have been many times when a woman has come to WIW on the brink of divorce. After sitting through empowerment sessions and spending time with the other women, they were able to work out their differences and stay married.
The event hosts a range of activities including the opportunity to hear from other women. Some of the female speakers, with occupations ranging from business owners to ministry, are brought in for the empowerment sessions.
Henderson said women are usually so busy taking care of other people that they tend to take less care of themselves, and through WIW women are receiving self-care.
“Nothing is more important than yourself,” they said. “You can give yourself to a thousand different things, but if you don't give to yourself then you fail.”
General admission is $65 and the empowerment luncheon is $55. To purchase tickets, visit www.melvahenderson.org

U.S. President Donald Trump denounced white supremacists including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on Monday, and said racism, hatred and bigotry had no place in America following a violent white-nationalist rally in Virginia.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va./WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs on Monday, bowing to mounting political pressure after initially saying many sides were to blame after a white-nationalist rally turned deadly in Virginia.
Trump had been assailed by Republicans and Democrats alike for failing to respond more forcefully to Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed when a man crashed their car into a group of counter-protesters.
Critics said the president had waited too long to address the bloodshed, and slammed them for initially saying that "many sides" were involved, rather than explicitly condemning white supremacists widely seen as sparking the melee.
"Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans," Trump said in a statement to reporters at the White House.
Trump said America showed its true character in such times, responding to hate with love and to division with unity.
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence," they said.

"It has no place in America ... No matter the colour of our skin, we all live under the same laws. We all salute the same great flag. And we are all made by the same almighty God."
A 20-year-old man said to have harboured Nazi sympathies as a teenager was facing charges they ploughed their car into protesters opposing the white nationalists, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 people. The accused, James Alex Fields, was denied bail at an initial court hearing on Monday.
Trump said anyone who engaged in criminal behaviour over the weekend in Virginia will be held accountable. "Justice will be delivered," the president said in their address.
"I wish that they would have said those same words on Saturday," responded Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia on MSNBC. "I'm disappointed it took them a couple of days."
Activist Al Sharpton echoed that. "It took 48 hours ... It was clearly a statement based on the pressure that they had been given over the weekend," they said on MSNBC.
Earlier on Monday, in a strong rebuke to Trump, the chief executive of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, Merck & Co Inc , resigned from a business panel led by the president, citing a need for leadership countering bigotry.
CEO Kenneth Frazier, who is black, did not name Trump in their statement, but the rebuke was implicit. "America's leaders must honour our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy," said Frazier.
DRIVER IN COURT
The outrage over Trump's reaction to the violence added to a litany of problems for the president.
Opponents have attacked them for their explosive rhetoric toward North Korea and they are publicly fuming with fellow Republicans in Congress over their failure to notch up any major legislative wins during their first six months in office.
Authorities said Heyer, 32, was killed when Fields' car slammed into a crowd of anti-racism activists, capping a day of bloody street brawls between the two sides.
Fields appeared on Monday in Charlottesville General District Court by video link from Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, where is been being held on a second-degree murder charge, three counts of malicious wounding and a single count of leaving the scene of a fatal accident. Their next court date was set for Aug. 25.
The U.S. Justice Department was pressing its own federal investigation of the incident as a hate crime.
Derek Weimer, a history teacher at Fields' high school in Kentucky, told Cincinnati television station WCPO-TV they recalled Fields harbouring "some very radical views on race" as a student and was "very infatuated with the Nazis, with Adolf Hitler."
A small group of people clashed outside the courthouse after the hearing, with two men blaming those who protested against the white nationalist rally with sparking the violence.
"The police department did not do anything to protect us," said Matthew Heimbach, one of the men. "Radical leftists are the ones that brought the violence. They are the ones that tried to kill us."
A woman yelled "Nazis go home!" over and over at Heimbach until police ushered them away. The Southern Poverty Law Center says Heimbach is considered to be the face of a new generation of white nationalists.
The weekend disturbances began when white nationalists converged to protest at against plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, the commander of rebel forces during the U.S. Civil War.
The violence prompted vigils and protests from Miami to Seattle on Sunday, including some targeting other Confederate statues. Such monuments have been flashpoints in the United States, viewed by many Americans as symbols of racism because of the Confederate defence of slavery in the Civil War.

LONDON: Taxi app Uber will improve conditions for its British drivers with changes including in-app tipping, after criticism from lawmakers and unions for not giving them more rights.
Drivers for Uber, food courier Deliveroo and other apps tend to work for a number of firms without a fixed contract in what has become known as the "gig economy".
Uber said on Monday it had held meetings and spoken to thousands of them as part of its attempts to improve conditions for its more than 50,000 drivers.
The company promised improvements in July after a government review said those working for such apps, who are mainly self-employed, deserved more rights.
"While drivers have told us they love the freedom of being their own boss, we've also clearly heard that we need to make improvements," Uber's UK General Manager Jo Bertram said.
Users will be able to tip drivers via the app rather than just in cash, have to pay 20 pence (US$0.26) per minute for making drivers wait after an initial two-minute period and the free cancellation period will be cut from five to two minutes.

Uber said it will make its ratings system fairer and allow drivers to turn down riders they do not wish to take more quickly, which will make it faster for them find a new ride.

Canadian fighter David Whittom's long fight for life has ended in tears.
The 39-year-old pugilist suffered a traumatic brain injury in a May 27, 2017 slugfest with Gary Kopas in a Canadian light-heavyweight title fight.
They had been in a coma for the last 10 months.
According to Journal de Quebec, Whittom suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in the bout.
Whittom — based in Quebec — ended up having a portion of their skull removed to relieve brain swelling following the 10-round match that was held in New Brunswick.
The fallen fighter's partner, Jelena Zerdoner, wrote a tearful post on Facebook.
“With a broken heart in a million pieces, I announce to you, my friends, that my David Whittom joined the angels and my mother this afternoon,” it read.
Fellow boxer and best friend Eric Martel Bahoeli also took to Facebook. They wrote: “I miss the words. I miss the breath. I am down to see that I lost, in so short a time, my two guardian angels. The two people who believed in me more than anyone. I love you like I have never loved anyone, thanks for everything, mom and David. Rest in peace, my champion. You fought too long. Now, [no] more pain.”
Calling the fallen fighter “a friend” and “a brother,” Martel Bahoeli noted how many adventures the pair had shared.
“A guy who ‘boosted' my confidence, a guy who has accompanied me in my career, a guy who, despite their ups and downs, has always been loyal to me.”

REUTERS: Cabela's Inc said it agreed to be bought by fellow outdoor goods retailer Bass Pro Shops for a lower price than agreed, and that it would sell its bank unit in a two-step deal as it seeks regulatory clearance for the transactions.
Synovus Financial Corp will buy certain assets of Cabela's financial division and then resell the credit card portfolio within the unit to Capital One Financial Corp , Cabela's said in a statement on Monday.
The unit, called World's Foremost Bank, was supposed to be bought by Capital One last year, but the deal wasn't able to get timely regulatory approval.
The new merger terms come amid regulatory scrutiny of the deal, although Cabela's did not offer a reason for the revised price.
The company was not immediately available to comment on the lowered merger price.
Bass Pro Shops will now buy Cabela's for about US$5 billion, US$500 million lower than the price agreed upon last year.
The deal, originally announced in October, will combine Cabela's 85 stores, which have a stronger U.S. Northwest presence, with Bass Pro's roughly 100 locations that are concentrated in the U.S. Southeast.
The companies have an overlap across Texas, Missouri and Kansas.
Cabela's had warned of a delay in closing the deal, because of delays in regulatory approval.
The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates and enforces antitrust laws, had sought more information from the companies about the deal.
Cabela's said on Monday it now expects the deal to close in the third quarter this year.
Bass Pro will acquire Cabela's for US$61.50 per share, lower than the originally agreed upon US$65.50-per-share price, Cabela's said.
Shares of Cabela's were up 6.6 percent at US$56.91 in after-market trade.

ANKARA: Seven Turkish soldiers were killed on Saturday (Feb 3) in Turkey's offensive against Kurdish militia inside Syria, including five who died in a single attack on a tank, the army said.
The losses marked the highest toll in one day for the Turkish military in operation "Olive Branch", launched on Jan 20 against Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia seen by Ankara as a terror group.
The attack on the tank, details of which were not disclosed, was also the single deadliest attack on the military of the offensive so far.
The latest clashes brought to 14 the number of Turkish troops killed so far in operation.
The Turkish army and allied Ankara-backed Syrian rebel forces are seeking to oust the YPG from its western border stronghold of Afrin but the operation so far has been marked by fierce clashes.
The army said that one of the soldiers was killed in a clash and another on the border area, without giving further details.

In a later statement, it added a Turkish army tank had been hit in another attack, killing all five servicemen inside.
A previous statement said one serviceman was killed and another wounded in that attack.
In retaliation, Turkish war planes carried out air strikes on the area from where the attack was carried out, destroying shelters and munitions dumps, it added.
OPERATION GOING 'AS PLANNED'
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Thursday the Turkish army and Ankara-backed rebels had suffered 25 fatalities between them in the operation so far.
Meanwhile, seven civilians have been killed in mortar fire on the Turkish side of the border that Ankara blames on the YPG.
Ankara says that major progress has been made in the 15-day operation, with almost 900 YPG fighters killed so far although it is not possible to verify these figures.
Erdoğan said in a speech Saturday that the Turkish forces were beginning to take mountain positions and would now head towards Afrin itself. "There is not much to go," they said.
Erdoğan's spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin meanwhile told journalists in Istanbul that the operation was going as planned but there was no timetable for its duration and it would "continue until we clear all those areas".
But analysts and monitors say Turkey so far has taken control of limited clumps of territory around the border without yet approaching near Afrin town.
Turkey says the YPG is an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state.
But the YPG has been working closely with the United States to fight the Islamic State extremist group in Syria.
The offensive by Washington's fellow NATO member Ankara on a US-allied force has even raised fears of a military confrontation between two alliance powers.
BOSTON: Kenya's Edna Kiplagat won the 121st running of the Boston Marathon on Monday in an unofficial time of two hours 21 minutes and 53 seconds, well ahead of their nearest competitors in the women's field.
Kiplagat, whose resume includes marathon wins in London, Moscow, New York and Daegu, broke away from the pack just before the race's hilliest section at about the 20-mile mark and ran aggressively through the hills on their way to an emphatic victory.

And a happy birthday to President Trump. Today the president turns 71 and they may be getting a big birthday card as a gift.
Last week, First Lady Melania Trump asked supporters to sign a card for their husband.
In a letter to supporters, the first lady said birthday celebrations always include family and close friends, but it is unclear how the president will be marking their birthday this year.
Work from Home is an option many companies are coming up with. It renders flexibility to employees and saves seating space for the employer, amongst many other benefits Working from Home entails. However, many employees often get caught up with the comfort a WFH option provides and resultantly deliver poor productivity. If you too are availing the Work from Home option or work from a Home-Office then here are 6 proven ways to optimize your productivity:1. Designate Time SlotsRemember Work from Home doesn't shorten your work or work hours. Designate time slot(s) in the morning, afternoon or evening and stick to them if you really want to be productive. Likewise, schedule breaks in between your work hours to unwind.2. Assign a Tidy CornerAssign a tidy corner for working every day. Invest in an ergonomic chair and table to work for long hours in the right posture. Sitting on a sofa or bed all day will harm your back besides making you slow. Also, ensure this corner is not the place you'll have breakfast, lunch or dinner. You need some change even if it means changing places within your boundary wall.3. CommunicateKeep communicating with your team members over the phone or messenger or emails to keep yourself engaged and focused at work. Similarly, limit personal chats or talks during your designated work time.4. Dress UpTake a bath and dress up in the morning to get into the professional mindset. Working in your PJs may appear cool but it hampers your productivity by making you laid back.5. Set TargetsSet targets for yourself and observe self-discipline to keep working from home in the long run. Remember you are saving yourself from the hassle of commuting one to two hours each day, can supervise your children at home, and save yourself from sun and pollution, too, so in all probability you won't like to compromise on the perks WFH brings.6. Set Correct ExpectationsSet correct expectations with your family and friends. If you are sitting and working from home, it doesn't mean that you are not working. You still have targets to meet, reports to send and get a performance appraisal too. Setting boundaries with your family will help minimize interruptions and let you work.
California researchers who tested marijuana sold in Northern California found multiple bacterial and fungal pathogens that can cause serious infections. The study was published this month in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection.
The mold and bacteria was so widespread and potentially dangerous that the UC Davis academics concluded that they cannot recommend smoking raw or dried weed. "We cannot recommend inhaling it," says George Thompson III, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the university who helped conduct the cannabis research.
The findings might also apply to indoor, hydroponic marijuana popular at Southern California collectives, according to Thompson. Using pot in baked goods such as brownies might be "theoretically" safer because the products could be heated enough to kill bacteria and fungus, they say.
Asked if concentrates such as wax, honey oil, dabs and shatter would be safe because heat is involved in the production process of "butane extraction," Thompson says they aren't sure.
The key finding of the research is that patients with weak immune systems, such as those with HIV or cancer, should avoid smoking raw and dried pot. Though Thompson told the Sacramento Bee that “for the vast majority of cannabis users, this is not of great concern,” they stress that there really isn't a safe way to smoke marijuana buds, even for those who are healthy.
They say it's possible that filters used with tobacco cigarettes could help with marijuana: Tobacco and all natural plant products have these kinds of bacterial and fungal issues. Irradiated marijuana, though unappealing, also could be an answer, they add.
Researchers sampled weed samples from Northern California dispensaries and found they tested positive for the fungi Cryptococcus, Mucor and Aspergillus, and for the bacteria E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. The academics said these can lead to serious and lethal illness, noting that smoking the mold and bacteria can embed them directly where they can do the most damage — the lungs.
"Infection with the pathogens we found in medical marijuana could lead to serious illness and even death," Joseph Tuscano, a professor of internal medicine at UC Davis, said in a statement. "Inhaling marijuana in any form provides a direct portal of entry deep into the lungs, where infection can easily take hold."
The state Department of Public Health is working on guidelines for marijuana testing with the goal that both medical and recreational pot sold next year at permitted dispensaries would be labeled as safe. It's not clear how this research will affect those guidelines. Thompson says they have reached out to state officials to share their findings.
"We are aware of the study, and while it's certainly concerning, this is exactly why we need regulation," Alex Traverso, spokesperson for the state Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, said via email. "The Bureau is working with the Department of Public Health to develop strong standards for testing because patient safety is extremely important to us all."
Edited at 12:24 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2017. A quote from the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation's spokesperson was added to the story.
Before the ceremony began, the officiant wanted to know: Who flirted first?
The groom, Jerry Tyler, looked guilty.
“I did,” they whispered.
Their bride, Stephine Gaston, was by their side in a billowy white dress, their bare back inked with two words: “Jerry's Girl.”
On Tuesday, the couple stood inside cubicle 4 at the Los Angeles County Registrar's office in Norwalk, ready to tie the knot on Valentine's Day.
Across Los Angeles County, more than 350 other couples joined them in what's become one of the busiest days of the year for wedding ceremonies. In 2014 — the last time the holiday landed on a weekday — nearly 700 couples in the county said I do.
Some showed up Tuesday dolled up with bouffant hairdos and three-piece suits; others wore jeans and sneakers.
Tyler, 40, of Gardena, and Gaston, 25, of Compton, had been planning this for a year. It's was Gaston's mother, Loren Scott, who wanted the big day to be on Valentine's.
When the time came for their vows, Tyler told Gaston:
“Together we will stand, no matter what, no matter who.”
And Gaston told Tyler:
“Thank you for everything you've invested in me. If you continue to do that, things will go great.”
Many couples were too nervous for words. They left all the talking to the officiant. That included Dulanjaree Perera, 31, and Tharanga Wickramaarachchi, 36, of Torrance.
The young Sri Lankan couple squeezed more than 40 relatives and friends into their cubicle. Grandmothers, children, siblings and co-workers looked on, snapping photos and video. The couple looked terrified.
“It's OK,” said officiant Raquel Hernandez-Aguilar. “This isn't scary. This is a happy moment.”
The hospital worker from Whittier had taken the day off work to marry couples, something they enjoy doing in their spare time.
“It makes you remember love,” said Hernandez-Aguilar, who couldn't remember how long she'd been married.
“Oh my God,” they said, laughing. “I think 10 years.”
Some soon-to-be husbands said that they chose their Valentine's wedding date out of convenience.
“I only have to buy one gift,” Fan Feng, 31, joked.
They and their bride, Lu Zhang, 29, have gone through a lot in the past four months. They graduated from college and moved from Wisconsin to California.
They are expecting a baby boy — in 12 days.
When things ease up, they plan to travel to China to celebrate big with family.
On this day, two friends joined them as witnesses.
“The truth is,” Feng said, “she's the sweetest girl I've ever known.”
For eight hours, the fifth floor remained an assembly line of civil matrimony. Couples checked in, then headed to a cubicle for their ceremony, then went down the hall to snap photos.
Ceremonies lasted between five and 10 minutes, with each officiant lending their or their own twist to the moment. (John Schatzel, who married Gaston and Tyler, wore Vans and candy cane striped socks under their black robe.)
Many find the best way to get brides and grooms to relax is with humor, even if it's not always intentional.
Take Hernandez-Aguilar's second wedding of the day: Melissa Cardenas, 23, and Rogelio Ortuno, 26, of Boyle Heights.
The couple met at work six months ago. They married with Cardenas' 4-year-old daughter, Lexie, by their side.
It was a serious and silent ceremony until the finale, when the pair were expected to lock lips.
“And now,” Hernandez-Aguilar said. “You may now kill your … I mean kiss. Kiss your bride!”

Mattel Inc.'s struggles deepened Monday as the El Segundo toymaker warned of slumping holiday sales as its debt was downgraded by the major credit-rating firms.
With only two weeks until Christmas, Mattel said in a securities filing that its fourth-quarter sales would be “negatively impacted” because of “certain underperforming brands” and because retailers were tightly controlling their inventories this holiday season.
As a result, Mattel — whose brands include Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels — said its full-year sales would drop by “a percentage in at least the mid-to-high single digits” compared with 2016, when sales totaled $5.5 billion.
Mattel said its profit also would suffer because the sales slump meant the company would have to write down the value of its inventory and offer discounts to retailers to clear out unsold products.
Those problems are why S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings further downgraded the company's debt, which already was below investment grade. The downgrades came as Mattel plans to sell an additional $1 billion of high-yield debt.
Nonetheless, Mattel's stock edged up nine cents to $15.13 a share in midday trading Monday. That gave Mattel a total market value of $5.2 billion.
Mattel's sales have been dropping since 2013 and early this year it hired a new chief executive, Margo Georgiadis, a former Google executive who is trying to turn things around and lower the company's costs. Among other things, Mattel in October suspended its quarterly dividend.
In the meantime, speculation persists that rival toymaker Hasbro Inc. has offered to buy Mattel, although no deal has been announced and both companies repeatedly have declined comment on the rumors.
Hasbro's brands include Transformers, G.I. Joe and “Star Wars” figures, games such as Monopoly and Littlest Pet Shop toys.
In downgrading Mattel's debt, Fitch Ratings cited Mattel's “execution missteps, including the inability of the company to effectively respond to evolving play patterns” among children, along with such challenges as retailers cutting back on purchases to keep their inventories lean.
Mattel has “been challenged by the phenomenon of children — in particular, girls — outgrowing traditional toys at a younger age, with greater interest in consumer electronics, beauty, sports and social media,” Fitch Ratings said.
Also pressuring sales was Toys R Us Inc.'s decision in September to file for bankruptcy protection. Toys R Us continues operating while working out a reorganization plan.
S&P Global Ratings, in explaining its downgrade of Mattel's debt, also cited “declining sales trends in certain key product lines, such as American Girl and Thomas” the Tank Engine train toys.

MOGADISHU: Suicide bombers attacked the main peacekeeping base in Somalia's capital on Monday, killing at least three Somali security officers, police said.
Islamist al Shabaab militants, who want to topple the Western-backed government, said they carried out the assault near Mogadishu's main airport, an area used by several embassies, aid groups and telecoms companies.
One bomber drove a car into a checkpoint outside the headquarters of the African Union peacekeeping force AMISOM, killing three Somali officers stationed there, police officer Mohamed Ahmed said.
Another vehicle then drove through towards the base's main gates but came under fire from peacekeepers.
"It exploded about 200 metres from the gate. Civilian buildings were damaged," AMISOM said on its Twitter feed.
The powerful blasts damaged the front of the nearby Hotel Peace, though there were no immediate reports of casualties there. The burned-out shell of one of the wrecked vehicles lay outside.
Al Shabaab's military spokesperson Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab said the fighters had intended to attack the hotel, as African leaders seeking a solution to Somalia's decades-long turmoil had met there last year.
Nearly 300 members of Somalia's federal parliament were sworn in last week after elections and are expected to pick a new president.

Darjeeling: Police recovered 300-400 weapons, including arrows, and explosives in raids on premises connected with Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung, sparking a call by the separatist group for an indefinite shutdown in Darjeeling hills.
In the fog-shrouded hilly roads of Darjeeling, GJM activists sparred with paramilitary personnel, hurling stones from a distance. The police officers responded by throwing stones back as a car burnt nearby. It was not clear if the car was that of a civilian or belonged to the police.
Police said some party activists also were arrested in the raids in Singmari and Patlebas areas of Darjeeling.
The developments came a day after Gurung said that their group's campaign for a separate Gorkhaland state would go on till it was achieved. They have asked tourists to avoid Darjeeling, a tea-growing region of West Bengal state and also one of the most popular tourist destinations in India.
"Some of the premises of Gurung and other GJM activists were raided. We conducted the raids on the basis of concrete information. The raids are still on. We have arrested a few GJM activists", a senior police official told PTI on condition of anonymity.
The police, however, denied that Gurung's residence had been raided.
Following the raids, the GJM called for an indefinite shutdown in the hills from Thursday.
"The state government is indulging in politics of witch-hunting", said GJM General Secretary Roshan Giri.
"The police and the state government are provoking us to call an indefinite strike in the hills. We will inform the Centre about the atrocities of the state government. We have called an indefinite shutdown in hills from Thursday," Giri told PTI.
On the recovery of weapons, the GJM leader said, "What have they found? Khukri is part of our tradition, what is the harm in keeping it? Bows and arrows are traditional weapons. They were meant for students for archery competition".
"The GJM is being targeted as we are fighting for a separate state. The police and the state government are trying to frame false cases against us", they alleged.
Giri said the Centre and the state government should solve the "political problem".
"We will inform the Centre of the police atrocities and seek Centre's intervention", Giri who is in Delhi, told PTI over phone.
"The present situation in the hills is created by the state government. They want to suppress us using huge police force", they alleged.
The raids came on the fourth day of the GJM-sponsored indefinite strike in government and GTA offices in the hills. The GJM's call for a separate state of Gorkhaland gained momentum after six other hill parties extended their support and unanimously passed a resolution on Tuesday for a new state to be carved out of Darjeeling hills.
The area is largely populated by Gorkhas who resent the imposition of Bengali, the predominant language of the rest of the state.
Prominent among the six states to join GJM is the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), which broke its alliance with the ruling Trinamool Congress.
The Centre has dispatched 600 paramilitary personnel to assist the West Bengal government in restoring normalcy in violence-hit Darjeeling hills which witnessed incidents of stone pelting during GJM-sponsored indefinite bandh.
The Centre had also sought a detailed report on the prevailing situation in the hill district from the state government.
DHAKA - Bangladesh police Tuesday shot dead an alleged commander of a banned Militant outfit blamed for last year's deadly cafe attack in the capital, an official said.
Police said Abu Jar was a close associate of Jahangir Alam, who was arrested last month after they allegedly led a campaign of targeted killings of religious minorities in the northern region.
Acting on a tip-off police raided a town outside the northern city of Bogra where Jar was killed in a gunfight, Bogra police chief Asaduz Zaman told AFP.
"We fired back after they opened fire at our officers," Zaman said, adding Jar was wanted in connection with several murder cases. "Jar was the northwestern commander of the new Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and a close associate of the group's top extremist Jahangir Alam," they added. Police said Alam was one of the masterminds of the siege of Dhaka's Holey Artisan Bakery cafe where 22 hostages, mostly foreigners, were killed by suspected gunmen of a "new-JMB".
Rights groups have raised questions about these gunfights saying many of these encounters were staged by officers to kill extremists. Several of them were allegedly found to be handcuffed when they were shot dead.
Police chief Zaman said Jar was "directly involved" in the murders of a Muslim and a Christian business person. Both murders were however claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
Jar's alleged boss Alam was accused of directly taking part in the murders of at least 22 religious minorities.
Bangladesh has been reeling from a wave of attacks on foreigners, rights activists and members of religious minorities.
The country's security forces has launched a deadly crackdown against Militant extremists following the cafe attack, killing around 50 Militant extremists, including most of the alleged leaders of JMB.
While many of those attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State or Al-Qaeda, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's secular government has blamed local militants instead, denying that international militants have gained a foothold in Bangladesh.
IPOH: Police are investigating after a group of individuals climbed the 'Ipoh' signboard at Jalan Kuala Kangsar. Photos of the incident have made the rounds on social media.
Ipoh District Police Chief, ACP Sum Chang Keong said police had received a report from the Ipoh City Council (MBI) early on Sunday morning (Jan 1) at the Ipoh District Police Headquarters.
They said the investigation would be carried out under Section 336 of the Penal Code for committing an act which could endanger their personal safety as well as that of others and if found guilty, the offenders could be jailed for not more than three months, or fined RM500 (US$111), or both.
"In this regard, police ask the media or the public with information on the group concerned to come forward and assist in the investigation," they said at a media conference.
Pictures and videos of the prank climb - which garnered the attention of netizens four days ago on Instagram and Youtube - showed a group of teenage boys and girls climbing the 20m-high signboard. The youths were also shown lying in hammocks tied to the poles of the signboard's frame.
IPOH CITY COUNCIL DID NOT RECEIVE APPLICATION TO CLIMB SIGNBOARD: MAYOR
MBI did not receive any application to climb the Ipoh signboard in Jalan Kuala Kangsar from any party, said Ipoh Mayor Zamri Man.
They said claims by a group of teenagers that MBI had approved their application to climb the iconic signage were untrue.
"I've checked, no approval was granted by any department heads including MBI. Even if there was such an application, we would not allow it," they told reporters during the New Year's Eve celebration and ceremony to launch Visit Perak Year 2017 on Saturday.
Zamri said the council had never given permission to the public to enter the area near the signage or climb it, except to contractors.
"Even for contractors who perform maintenance work, we make sure they adhere to security protocols by wearing safety belts, in addition to using a crane," they said.
They said the teenagers' actions of lying in the hammocks attached to the poles of the signage could be categorised as vandalism.
"The signage's poles could give way and hit road users because it is not a structure erected to take up additional load such as the weight of individuals," they said.
On whether the council would confront the group of teenagers involved, Zamri said there was a possibility.

Three million sandbags have been dispersed across the Okanagan Valley in a mad scramble to fortify the shoreline from the rising Okanagan Lake, but there is no formal plan in place yet to remove them.
Officials said the flood threat isn't over and residents should keep the sandbags in place while they formulate a safe sandbag disposal strategy.
Some suggest dumping the sand on local beaches. “Right on the beach, but it's back on the beach because the water's washed out everything that's there,” said one man at Red Wing Resort, an area the hardest hit by high water in the south Okanagan.
But officials encouraged members of the public to avoid dumping the sand on the beach because it could be contaminated by floodwater and damage the local ecosystem.
“There have been septic tanks that have been overwhelmed or there have been areas where there is lots of effluent from livestock,” said Zoe Kirk with the Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen.
The provincial government issued a public information bulletin asking residents to wear gloves and boots to protect themselves from scrapes and potential contaminants while removing sandbags, to not use the sand in playgrounds or sandboxes and that contents should not be disposed of in lakes, rivers, wetlands, floodplains, or parks.
Emergency officials don't want to overwhelm the local landfills either.
Local governments are in talks with the province to create a formal plan for sandbag disposal.
“Whether they be localized bins, whether they be places for people to load sandbags onto palettes, those are all under discussion,” Kirk said.
In the meantime the public is being asked to avoid the urge to slit open those sandbags.
“We've heard rumours of folks wanting to take it off their beach or get on with summer and dump the sand behind buildings and infrastructure, but we haven't corroborated that,” Kirk said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel flew to Caracas on Wednesday for their first foreign trip as head of state, a show of solidarity for Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro, whose controversial re-election this month has drawn condemnation in the West.
"I pledge to you that no matter how big the challenges, you can count on Cuba today and forever," Diaz-Canel said after meeting Maduro in the Miraflores presidential palace.
"Venezuela now needs our solidarity," they earlier told Venezuela's Constituent Assembly, a pro-government legislative superbody.
The United States, the European Union and major Latin American countries have condemned Maduro's May 20 re-election, saying it did not meet democratic standards.
Two of their rivals were barred from standing and the election board is run by loyalists. The U.S. government imposed new sanctions on the crisis-stricken oil exporter.
But China and Russia have warned against meddling in the Socialist-run country, and fellow leftist governments in the region from Cuba to Bolivia have offered their support.
"Your words express the best of the Cuban people and we are forever grateful for the support you have given us," said Delcy Rodriguez, a senior Maduro ally who heads the Assembly, which critics say has undermined the opposition-controlled legislature, the National Assembly.
Maduro was the first foreign leader to meet with Diaz-Canel last month after they succeeded Raul Castro to become president of the Communist-run island.
Venezuela, which holds the world's largest oil reserves, exchanges crude for Cuban medical and other technical services, though deliveries have dropped in recent years during an economic implosion in the country of 30 million people.
"We felt (Maduro's) victory as our own," Diaz-Canel said. "Venezuela has supported Cuba in many ways throughout its history. We have a debt of gratitude."
Venezuelan opposition politicians say bilateral relations with Cuba are deeply unfavourable.
"Maduro did not sell the country, they handed it over. NATIONAL SHAME!" tweeted opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido, posting a picture of Diaz-Canel wearing a sash with the yellow blue and red Venezuelan colours on Wednesday.
Diaz-Canel flew to Venezuela with their wife Liz Cuesta as first lady, in a break with custom during the nearly 60 years' rule by the Castro brothers Fidel and Raul who generally travelled without their spouses.
Diaz-Canel's visit came as Cuban authorities faced the chaos of flooding in the wake of Subtropical Storm Alberto that has killed already four people and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands.

On-loan striker Enner Valencia may have given Everton manager Ronald Koeman one less thing to think about in the January transfer window after their game-changing substitute appearance in the 3-0 victory over Southampton.
The Ecuador international came off the bench to enliven a dreary occasion, scoring the 73rd-minute opener and winning the late penalty which allowed Leighton Baines to double their lead before Romelu Lukaku gave the scoreline a flattering appearance.
That late show papered over some of the cracks which were evident in the preceding three-quarters of a game which seemed to be meandering towards a dull draw until Valencia's introduction.
Koeman made four changes, Saints boss Claude Puel six, and that disruption was not helped by enforced substitutions in the opening 12 minutes.
Southampton right-back Cedric Soares departed with a head injury after colliding with the advertising boards while 19-year-old Dominic Calvert-Lewin, making their first Everton start, went off with an ankle problem.
Despite the Toffees having an extra day's rest they looked lethargic, struggled to string more than a couple of passes together, their control was poor and they lacked any invention going forward.
Considering Koeman's limited options on the bench, having already used Kevin Mirallas and with former Barcelona youth team forward Gerard Deulofeu's days looking numbered after being omitted from the squad for the second successive match, their desire to add both quality and numbers now the transfer window is open is obvious.
With defensive midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye, arguably their best player this season, now joining up with Senegal for the African Nations Cup there is even greater need for reinforcements.
The performance should, at the very least, strengthen Koeman's case for the need for new blood with majority shareholder and billionaire Farhad Moshiri, who was present to see the shortcomings first-hand.
Southampton were not much better in the early stages but improved slightly towards the end of a half which saw Fraser Forster make two saves from Ross Barkley and Lukaku, and Jay Rodriguez, who did actually put the ball in the net - with their arm although it was ruled out for offside - seeing their cross-shot deflect off Ashley Williams, forcing Joel Robles to claw the ball away.
Rodriguez, who easily turned Tom Davies and beat Williams, and substitute Mirallas then both wasted good chances just before half-time with Nathan Redmond also heading wide.
The introduction of Valencia, Koeman's only other attacking option off the bench, on the hour injected some life into proceedings and produced the breakthrough, although Lukaku took most of the credit.
Forster did well to stop the Belgium international's powerful close-range header but the striker deflected the rebound to their team-mate who scrambled home.
Baines made it seven points from nine over the Christmas period from the spot after Valencia was fouled by Maya Yoshida and Lukaku's second in three games added gloss to the display.
A third successive defeat made it a miserable festive period for Southampton, however.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, Cameron Romo, 19, of Rialto, staked out their gastronomical prize: the Dodgers' Chicken Waffle Sammy with a piece of fried chicken and candied, smoked bacon sandwiched between two Belgian waffles. They carried one in each hand as took an elevator to the stadium's top deck.
"I'm 100% excited," they said. They saw the postseason-special delicacy advertised online and knew they had to find one.
"I hope it's the best thing I've ever experienced," they said.
Romo might not stop there. By game's end, they might also try to get their hands on the Double Bacon Double Cheeseburger, two beef patties, cheese, bacon, maple syrup and blackberry jam with a donut on top.
With its 160 rooms and rumoured ghosts hiding among the darkened corners, the mystery of Winchester House, built by Sarah Winchester, the widow of rifle company magnate William Winchester, still draws droves of people to San Jose to try and uncover the building's secrets.
LOS ANGELES: With its 160 rooms and rumoured ghosts hiding among the darkened corners, the mystery of Winchester House, built by Sarah Winchester, the widow of rifle company magnate William Winchester, still draws droves of people to San Jose to try and uncover the building's secrets.
In the new film "Winchester," out in theatres on Friday, it is Oscar-winning actor Dame Helen Mirren who attempts to shed a light on the enigma of Winchester, who died in 1922 leaving their labyrinth of a home to become an attraction.
Mirren compared the widow Winchester, whom they called "fascinating," to jilted spinster Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations," a literary character famous for being an eccentric, distraught recluse who lives in the past.
"Winchester" follows psychologist Dr Eric Price (Jason Clarke), who is hired by the Winchester rifle company to evaluate the sanity of the black-veiled Sarah, after they hired carpenters to work around the clock to build more and more rooms in their mansion.
"One of the legends that grew up around them was the legend that they bought the house to placate the ghosts who had been murdered or killed by the Winchester rifle, and the sense of guilt, the pressure and the weight of those spirits upon her," Mirren said.
As Dr Price's investigations continue into the house, more and more spooky events happen in the house, which is known as one of the most haunted houses in America.

"Ghost stories have been told by people over fires for thousands of years so the world of the spirits is very present in the human experience. We talk about it, we think about it, it's in our art, it's in our culture. It's an authentic part of the human experience," Mirren said.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia lifted a 35-year-old ban on cinemas on Monday, prompting celebrations from film fans, directors and movie chains eyeing the last untapped mass market in the Middle East. FILE PHOTO: Saudis watch composer Yanni perform at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, December 3, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/File PhotoThe first theatres could start showing films as early as March, the government said, part of a liberalising reform drive that has already opened the door to concerts, comedy shows, and women drivers over the past year. Cinemas were banned in the early 1980s under pressure from Islamists as Saudi society turned towards a particularly conservative form of the religion that discouraged public entertainment and public mixing between men and women. But reforms led by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have eased many of those restrictions, as the government tries to broaden the economy and lessen its dependence on oil. “Opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification,” said Minister of Culture and Information Awwad bin Saleh Alawwad. “By developing the broader cultural sector we will create new employment and training opportunities, as well as enriching the Kingdom's entertainment options.” In a nod to conservatives, the government said the films would be censored to make sure they remain “in line with values and principles in place and do not contradict with Sharia Laws and moral values in the kingdom.” The details of that censorship were not announced, but could be extensive in a country where images of women are often crossed out on advertising. There was no immediate reaction from the kingdom's Wahhabi clergy and conservative groups, who have responded to past suggestions about bringing back cinema with outraged social media campaigns. Public objections to the reforms have been more muted in recent months, after authorities launched a spate of arrests clamping down on critics of the programme. “CINEMA IS JOY” Up to now, the kingdom's film pioneers have had to focus on foreign markets to get their works shown. “Saudi Arabia is always in the news, but it's nice to be in the news in this way,” said Los Angeles-based Saudi director Haifaa Al Manour, who released the first full-length feature shot entirely in the kingdom, Wadjda, in 2012. “I feel like we're about to relive what Egypt was like in the ‘50s,” they said, referring to the explosion of film-making in what is now the epicentre of Arabic popular cinema. Prince Mohammed has also sought to promote a more tolerant form of Islam and crack down on extremism, a cause Mansour said would be furthered by films. “If you want to fight terrorism, you need to give people a love of life. A love of life comes from joy, and cinema is joy.” Thousands of Saudis currently travel to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and other countries for their entertainment. The government has said it wants to retain the money spent on those trips. Regional cinema chains have also been eyeing the Saudi market, keen to tap the spending power of the young people who make up roughly 70 percent of the kingdom's population. Dubai-based mall operator Majid Al Futtaim, which owns the VOX Cinemas chain, said it wanted to open the first movie theatre there. ”We are very happy about this announcement, as you can imagine, we have been waiting for it for quite some time,” said chief executive Alain Bejjani. The government said it expected to open more than 300 cinemas with more than 2,000 screens by 2030, building an industry that would contribute more than 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create 30,000 permanent jobs over the same period. A commission chaired by Alawwad will announce details of licensing and regulations over the next few weeks, it added. Locations for the first cinemas are still under study, but would likely be in top population centres, Fahad al-Muammar, the supervisor of cinema in the kingdom's General Commission for Audiovisual Media, told state TV al-Ekhbariya. ($1 = 3.7502 riyals)

REUTERS: Chinese drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd is tightening data security in the hopes that the U.S. Army will lift its ban on DJI drones because of "cyber vulnerabilities," a company official told Reuters on Monday.
The privately held Shanghai-based company is speeding deployment of a system that allows users to disconnect from the internet during flights, making it impossible for flight logs, photos or videos to reach DJI's computer servers, Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI, said in an interview.
The security measure had been in the works for several months but DJI said it is bringing it out sooner than planned because of an Army memo earlier this month that barred service members from using DJI drones.
DJI said it has not had any communication with the Army about the issue. An Army spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The other branches of the military have not banned the use of drones by DJI, the largest consumer drone maker with millions of the devices sold.
"The Army memo caused customers to express renewed concern about data security" and prompted DJI to speed up data security changes, Schulman said.
Some drone pilots choose to share images and video with DJI, which makes them visible on its SkyPixel website. But many businesses and government customers have raised concerns about sensitive video and pictures - such as movie footage or images of critical infrastructure - and want to ensure it is never sent to DJI, they said.

DJI said it does not collect images, video or flight logs from users unless they share them. But turning on the new "local data mode" will prevent accidental syncing with DJI's servers. Its drones do not rely on an internet connection to fly.
Cutting the link between the internet and DJI's controller apps that run on tablets and mobile phones will disable updates of maps, flight restrictions and other data that the controller application receives from the internet while the drone is in use, they said.
Schulman said DJI plans to make updates to its controller applications available by the end of September, earlier than previously planned. The new apps with local data mode may not be available in all countries if there are regulations that require pilots to have the most updated maps and information.
DJI had about 70 percent share of the global commercial and consumer drone market, analysts at Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer estimated in 2016.
Goldman analysts estimated the market, including military, to be worth more than US$100 billion over the next five years.

The world body has received reports of Naxals using children to fight in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and of terrorists burning at least 30 schools in Kashmir in the past one year.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in their annual report on Children in Armed Conflict, said, "Children continued to be affected by incidents of violence between armed groups and the government, in particular in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, as well as tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.""The United Nations continued to receive reports of the recruitment and use of children by armed groups, including the Naxalites, in particular in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand," they said.Guterres quoted government reports to say that at least 30 schools were burned and partially destroyed by armed groups in Jammu and Kashmir."In addition, government reports confirmed the military use of four schools by security forces in that region for several weeks."Guterres's report for 2016, however, shows that the prevalence of the use of children by Naxalites and other armed groups had come down to only two states compared to six in the previous year.In the report for 2015 released last year, the then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had said the Naxalites were using children as young as six in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal.Guterres's report covering conflicts during 2016 was sent to the Security Council on Thursday.The report that talks about a number of other nations also said that there were about 4,000 verified cases of violations against children involving government forces and over 11,500 by non-state armed groups in the 20 nations covered in the report."I call upon the (Indian) government to develop appropriate mechanisms to protect children from recruitment, as well as to separate and reintegrate recruited children," Guterres said."I also urge the government to ensure the protection of children from any form of violence in the context of civil unrest or law and order operations.""Children continued to be killed and injured in the context of operations of national security forces against Maoist armed groups," Guterres said, but did not provide any numbers.According to the Home Affairs Ministry, 213 civilians were killed in encounters, a sharp increase from the 171 deaths in 2015. However, the number of children killed or injured have not been provided, the UN report said."Armed groups reportedly resorted to abduction and threats against parents in order to recruit children, who subsequently underwent military training and served as messengers, informants or guards in child squads (bal dasta)," Guterres said in the latest report.In what they described as a "troubling development," Maoists were allegedly providing combat training as part of the curriculum in several schools they were running in Chhattisgarh.In one incident recounted in Guterres's report, police moved 23 children threatened with abduction by armed groups in Gumla district, Jharkhand, in March 2016 and "supported their enrollment in schools".However, they added, "unverified reports suggest that police may be using children formerly associated with armed groups as informants, potentially making them targets for retaliation."Guterres also said that because of "access restrictions" to the conflict areas, the UN was not able to verify the incidents.

AggregateIQ says it helps customers craft messages for online political ads, use data for campaigns
The co-founders of a B.C. company at the centre of the international scandal over the alleged inappropriate use of Facebook data are defending their work in support of political campaigns around the globe.
Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Jeff Silvester of the B.C.-based political advertising firm AggregateIQ says the company helps its customers craft their messages for online political ads and how to effectively make use of data for their campaigns.
But Silvester, the firm's chief operating officer, insists AggregateIQ does not harvest data and only uses what it is provided — nor does it undertake any kind of voter profiling, including psychographic profiling.
They say the company's work differs little from what political campaigns in Canada do to promote a candidate or a party, such as putting up lawn signs, sending volunteers to knock on doors and making phone calls.
The Victoria firm has been suspended by Facebook and is under investigation by privacy commissioners in Ottawa, B.C. and the United Kingdom for its role in a controversy that allegedly involved a breach of millions of users' private information to help the “Leave” side win the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit referendum.

READ MORE: Victoria firm tied to Facebook scandal got $100K from feds in 2017
AggregateIQ has also been linked to Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy firm accused of improperly accessing the private Facebook data to help the Leave campaign in Brexit as well as Donald Trump's winning 2016 U.S. presidential bid.
In their testimony Tuesday, Silvester said AggregateIQ has always complied with laws in Canada and abroad. They also disputed allegations raised by Canadian data expert and whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, saying AggregateIQ has never been part of Cambridge Analytica nor its parent company, SCL.
“We are not data harvesters by any stretch of the imagination and, certainly, we don't do psychographic profiling or profiling of any other type,” they told the committee on access to information, privacy and ethics, which is holding hearings this month on the data breach involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.
“We're not psychologists, we're tech guys.”
Efforts by volunteers and political candidates themselves to persuade voters are no different from the work of AggregateIQ, they added.
“The ads that we show — it's the digital equivalent of an ad on someone's lawn or on a street corner,” they said.
“You choose where you want it go, you put your message on there and people drive by and see it. And it's the same for the internet and same with going door to door and the same with making phone calls.”
Facebook estimates the personal information of 622,161 users in Canada — and nearly 87 million worldwide — was improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica.

REUTERS: Telecoms parts producer Corning Inc beat expectations for profit on Tuesday thanks to optical fibre cable sales, but a drop in sales in its screen glass unit added to growing market nerves about demand for high-end smartphones.
Shares of Corning, whose toughened Gorilla glass is the screen of choice for smartphones including Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, rose 2 percent in trading before the bell.
At least two other Apple suppliers - contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and chipmaker AMS - have pointed to soft demand from smartphone customers in the past week. Analysts have attributed the softness to weaker-than-anticipated demand for the Californian firm's iPhone X.
Global sales of smartphones to end users totalled nearly 408 million units in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 5.6 percent year-over-year decline for the first time, Gartner Research said in February.
Corning said on Tuesday net sales in its speciality materials business, which makes Gorilla Glass, fell 7 percent to US$278 million in the first quarter, missing analysts' estimate of US$293 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Sales in its LCD glass business, used in televisions and PCs, also declined 5 percent to US$745 million, below Wall Street estimates of US$747.5 million.

The only bright spot was the demand for optical fibre cables as telecom companies invest in upgrading their networks ahead of the rollout of 5G.
The industry will spend US$225 billion on 5G between 2019 and 2025, according to a research note published by Morgan Stanley in October.
Net sales from Corning's optical communications business, which makes fibre optic cables and connectors and contributes nearly one-third to its total sales, rose 8 percent to US$886 million.
Corning's net loss was US$589 million, or 72 cents per share in the first quarter, compared with a profit of US$86 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Corning earned 31 cents per share on revenue of US$2.51 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 30 cents per share and an adjusted revenue of US$2.49 billion.

Todd James provides an update on what's going on at the Edmonton International Film Festival on Friday afternoon.
Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank has withdrawn from American Manufacturing Council saying the company “engages in innovation and sports, not politics.”
He's the second CEO to step down Monday after Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier resigned following U.S. President Donald Trump's comments stemming from the racist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. over the weekend.

Trump was being widely criticized for not condemning the white nationalists involved in the Saturday attack that left one woman dead after a car was driven into counterprotesters on Saturday, until two days after the incident.
Their initial comments condemned an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,” but didn't single out the nationalists who were widely seen as sparking the melee. They were also widely slammed for stating that “many sides” were involved.
READ MORE: Why has Charlottesville been the location of several white nationalist rallies?
On Monday they added: “Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”
Frazier, who quit before Trump's comments Monday, said they left the council because they have “a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”
Plank didn't specifically site Trump's reaction to the violence as a reason, but said they wanted to promote “unity, diversity and inclusion.”
“I am appreciative of the opportunity to have served, but have decided to step down from the council,” Plank said in a statement on Twitter.

“I love our country and our company and will continue to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion.”
Plank is already being praised for leaving Trump's council, but others aren't so happy with him.
“In order to invoke change we must make a shift. @UnderArmour is taking a stand !” NAACP tweeted in response.

VICTORIA – More than 1,400 British Columbians died due to suspected illicit drug overdoses in 2017, according to data released today by the BC Coroners Service.
Preliminary data indicate there were 1,422 suspected drugs overdose deaths in 2017, representing a 43% increase from 2016, when there were 993 overdose deaths. There were significantly fewer deaths, however, in the last four months of 2017 (average of 96.5 deaths per month from September to December) compared with the first eight months of the year (average of 129.5 deaths per month).
“By continuing to provide timely, accurate data to the public, and policy- and decision-makers throughout the province, we're able to support evidence-based measures to keep British Columbians safer when it comes to substance use,” said chief coroner Lisa Lapointe. “There is no question that this is a public-health crisis that is impacting people from all walks of life, and we need to continue to work together to help reduce stigma and increase awareness and support for those at risk.”
According to preliminary data, a total of 103 suspected drug overdose deaths occurred in November 2017, down from 140 in November 2016, and a total of 99 suspected drugs overdose deaths occurred in December 2017, down from 164 in December 2016. The 2017 totals will likely increase as additional analysis is completed.
Approximately 81% of the suspected illicit drug deaths to date in 2017 had fentanyl detected, up from 67% in 2016. In most cases, fentanyl was combined with other illicit drugs, most often cocaine, heroin or methamphetamines. Carfentanil has been detected in 64 suspected illicit drug overdose deaths between June and December of 2017. The majority of deaths continue to occur in private residences.
“As the coroners' data show all too clearly, we are still in the midst of a persistent and continuing epidemic of unintentional poisoning deaths,” said provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall. “Through heroic and unprecedented actions, responders on the front lines are daily saving hundreds of lives. But hundreds more are still dying, most often alone and with no-one nearby to act when things go wrong. We are going to need to think more broadly, and further out of our comfort zone, to end these tragic losses.”
“Despite cautious optimism that deaths have not increased in the last four months, we cannot be complacent,” said Dr. Patricia Daly, executive director and clinical lead for the B.C. Overdose Emergency Response Centre and chief medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health. “In 2018, the provincial Overdose Emergency Response Centre will support communities to intensify those strategies we know can prevent overdose deaths – such as naloxone distribution, drug-checking services and outreach teams to connect people to treatment – and explore innovative strategies to reach those most at risk of death.”
Quick Facts:
* Key trends in 2017 suspected illicit drug-overdose death cases:
* More suspected illicit drug overdose deaths occurred during the five days following income assistance payments than in all other days of the month so far in 2017, with an average of six deaths per day;
* Vancouver Coastal Health Authority has the highest rate of illicit drug overdose deaths at 35.9 deaths per 100,000 individuals among all health authorities, and experienced the largest increase in rate in 2017 at a 50% increase over 2016;
* Fraser Health had the highest number (377) of illicit drug overdose deaths with fentanyl detected in 2017, followed by Vancouver Coastal Health (337) and Interior Health (200);
* The three townships experiencing the highest number of illicit drug overdose deaths in 2017 are Vancouver (358), Surrey (174) and Victoria (91);
* More than half of the 2017 deaths involved persons between the ages of 30 and 49 years, and individuals aged 19 to 59 years accounted for 90% of suspected illicit drug overdose deaths;
* Approximately four out of five who died were male;
* Almost nine out of every 10 deaths occurred indoors, including more than half in private residences;
* The rate of illicit drug overdose deaths increased for the second consecutive year by approximately nine deaths per 100,000 to reach 30 deaths per 100,000 in 2017; and
* No deaths occurred at any supervised consumption site or at any of the drug overdose prevention sites.
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.: Elon Musk's SpaceX plans to resume flying rockets next week following an investigation into why one of them burst into flames on a launch pad four months ago, the company said on Monday.
In a statement, SpaceX said it expected to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Jan. 8 to put 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc.
SpaceX had suspended flights after the same model rocket went up in a blaze on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test in Florida.
The explosion at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida destroyed the US$62 million rocket and a US$200 million communications satellite.
SpaceX, owned and operated by Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Officer Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than US$10 billion.
The company statement said that accident investigators concluded that a canister of helium inside the rocket's upper-stage oxygen tank had exploded.
In the short term, SpaceX plans to revamp its fueling procedures so that the super-cold liquid oxygen will not build up between the helium tank's liner and its outer covering, it added.
SpaceX said accumulation of oxygen in a void or buckle in the liner most likely led to the explosion.
“In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the (helium canisters) to prevent buckles altogether,” the statement said.
The company did not say when new helium canisters would be ready to fly, but that using warmer temperature helium and a slower fueling operation will prevent them from bursting.
“Iridium is pleased with SpaceX's announcement on the results of the September 1 anomaly as identified by their accident investigation team, and their plans to target a return to flight,” company spokesperson Diane Hockenberry said in a statement.
SpaceX has not said how much damage the Sept. 1 accident did to its primary Florida launch pad, nor when a new second pad in Florida, located at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, will be put into service.

HBL declares profit after tax of Rs34b
HBL today declared a consolidated profit after tax of Rs34.2 billion for the full year 2016, with earnings per share of Rs23.23.
Along with the results, the bank declared a final dividend of Rs3.50 per share (35%), bringing the total dividend for the year to Rs14 per share. HBL's balance sheet has grown by 13 percent over December 2015 to reach Rs2.5 trillion. Overall, the bank added Rs250 billion in deposits, while maintaining its CASA ratio. Current accounts increased by more than 16 percent, reaching nearly Rs700 billion with the current account mix improving to 37 percent of total deposits.
In 2016, HBL grew its average domestic current accounts by 19 percent over 2015, enabling the bank to reduce its cost of deposits. With the improved economic climate, lending growth has accelerated with loans growing by over 17 percent, driven by increases in corporate lending, but with strong support from the SME and consumer segments. The bank was thus able to grow net interest income by 5 percent to Rs82.0 billion for 2016.

PARIS: Johnny Sexton's last-second drop goal earned Ireland a dramatic 15-13 away victory against France in their Six Nations opener as Les Bleus suffered an agonising defeat in coach Jacques Brunel's first game in charge on Saturday.
Sexton's 44-metre drop goal almost three minutes into injury time stunned the Stade de France as the hosts thought they would prevail after a splendid late try by wing Teddy Thomas.
But Sexton, who scored all their team's points as they also slotted home four penalties, had other ideas.
France had stayed in contention thanks to Maxime Machenaud's two penalties before Thomas's dazzling run and Anthony Belleau's conversion had put them ahead for the first time.
Les Bleus, who have not won in their last seven games, lost teenage sensation Matthieu Jalibert after the flyhalf suffered a knee injury in the first half.
Brunel, who took over from Guy Noves after a poor November series, banked on Jalibert to instil some life into the French team, but the 19-year-old limped off the field after half an hour.

Replacement scrumhalf Antoine Dupont was also injured.
"We have to wait for the medical exams but it seems to be serious for Antoine Dupont, and possibly for Matthieu Jalibert," Brunel told a news conference.
France were penalised for offside early on and Sexton coolly slotted home the penalty as Ireland got off to a lively start.
The hosts were often pinned back to their own half with Connor Murray's kicks proving tough to handle, but they enjoyed a good spell after 15 minutes as Jalibert showed a lot of pace.
But Ireland defended ferociously and never allowed Les Bleus into their 22 metres.
Another Sexton routine penalty earned Ireland a 6-0 lead.
Jalibert left the pitch to be replaced by Belleau on the half hour after hurting their knee.
Machenaud reduced the arrears five minutes before the interval with a penalty France won at the breakdown, only for Sexton to restore the six-point lead after a Sebastien Vahaamahina foul on Murray in the scrum.
The second rower was sanctioned again for offside and Sexton converted the resulting penalty to fatten up Ireland's advantage, only for Machenaud to reply with a penalty.
France were still in contention after Sexton missed their first penalty of the night and Thomas scored the only try of an otherwise locked game.
Belleau converted to put France ahead but missed another penalty. Ireland pushed in the closing stages and Sexton fired a fine drop goal after a long spell of possession.
France travels to Scotland while Ireland host Italy next weekend.

NEW YORK (AP) — Claire's, the mall chain that has pierced the ears of millions of teens, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The company said Monday that its stores will remain open as it restructures its debt.
It's just the latest retailer to seek bankruptcy protection, close stores or go out of business entirely. Toys R Us announced last week that it would close or sell all its stores after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year.
Claire's said Monday it is “confident” it will emerge from bankruptcy protection in September, having reduced its debt by nearly $2 billion. It said it can compete with the shift to online shopping, arguing that its “iconic ear piercing services are unmatched and cannot be replicated online.”
Claire's, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, said it has pierced more than 100 million ears since it began offering the service 40 years ago. The company was founded in the 1960s.

A story was told about Arya, a gallant sailor who mesmerised by a gorgeous Li-Na in the vibrant streets of Hong Kong in the late '90s. Fast forward to 2017, the love story might have remained unrequited for the sailor, but the rose-tinted memories convert themselves into a promising club in Delhi's now-trending hotspot, The Andaz. Conceptualised to emulate the essence of Hong Kong as a melting pot of rich cultures and ideas, the Hong Kong Club brings modern Cantonese gastronomy to the capital, with intriguing cocktails amid a contemporary ambience.
The Hong Kong vibe
With the usual club format but following a tighter setting, the Hong Kong Club surprises the customers with the sheer scale of its spaces—the restaurant features two floors with 292 covers and double height spaces, an island bar, hidden private dining rooms with their own bars, open kitchens, and towering wine racks. The international-style interiors run along fluid lines and are dotted with authentic oriental ceramics and art that set the mood.
HKC enjoys a commanding position inside a glass-clad structure situated at the heart of the Andaz, symbolic to the hotel's ambition of becoming an epicentre of nightlife in Delhi. The ambition being realised would not be a surprise, with the unique atmosphere it creates. The dining rooms are sure to play host to numerous private dinners, and at the same time, you could spot the clubbing connoisseurs shake a leg around the bar.
Zodiac cocktails, anyone?
Familiar with Hong Kong nightlife? It is a given that the drinks will take centre stage and HKC lives to that promise. Enter 12 specialty cocktails, each inspired by one of the mythological animals of the Chinese zodiac. You'll find your favourite base—scotches, gins or champagnes—infused with oriental flavours such has miso, yuzu, five spice mixes and more, presented in a theatrical manner, with some involving live-torching hay and cinnamon sticks. While one might be tempted to go for the cocktail assigned to their zodiac, we strongly suggest trying the mystical Sun Wukong (single malt with banana liqueur, yuzu, five spice and bitters), the invigorating Qilin (in-house Delhi Sapphire gin, watermelon and gold dust) or discover the sweet surprise in the Moon Rabbit (champagne and lychee).
Canton Road coming up
Amid the umpteen options for Asian cuisines in the capital, the Hong Kong Club distinguishes itself with a focus on the Cantonese—the cuisine from the Guangzhou region of China, famously known for its ports and fast living. However, the six Cantonese chefs at the Club aren't just serving the region on the plate, but contextualising it in smarter ways. “Our focus is on modern Cantonese fare—traditional dishes with modern interpretations and integration of local produce. There is so much fantastic local produce here in Indian that people underestimate!” says Alex Moser, head chef at the Hong Kong Club, who has been with the Hyatt group for over 19 years.
This thought is witnessed with a stunning pork belly, with a crackling loud enough to create master chef moments on the tongue, served with kasundi mustard. Traditional Cantonese chicken is fermented in peach wine, and duck salad is served with pomelo and pine nuts: each creating poetries in flavours and textures, each a perfect pairing for that cocktail in your hand.
The region focuses on stir-fries and steaming as cooking methods due to convenience and speed, and an array of dimsum on the menu doesn't surprise. The silky lobster and crab dimsum (with seafood for bitg sourced from Kerala) is all about the meats while the mushroom bao dusted with mushroom dust is beautifully crafted. The mains feature some noteworthy staples such as fried rice topped with dried olive leaves, and seasonal vegetable stir-fry with onion seeds, to keep the palate fresh. In deserts, memorable plates include the star anise crème brûlée (with pineapple chunks and sorbet) which explodes with flavours, while the sago pudding (with passion fruit jelly, almond milk and honeycomb) masters the fine balance of sweetness for the perfect ending.

WASHINGTON: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said late on Friday it had approved Alphabet Inc's application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico through balloons.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites.
Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to "support licensed mobile carriers' restoration of limited communications capability" in Puerto Rico.
Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced they were forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
"It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services," Pai said in statement.
Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that they had a "great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow."

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago.
Musk said they were diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and "increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas."
In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

BC Liberal leadership candidate Todd Stone's campaign admits it knew about problems with nearly 1,350 eventually-rejected party memberships two weeks longer than it had initially acknowledged — and had fought for them to be accepted.
In a statement issued Saturday “to correct certain public statements attributed to our campaign in the last 24 hours,” a spokesperson wrote that the campaign was actually contacted by party headquarters regarding “concerns” with the memberships on Jan. 12.

On Friday, campaign spokesperson Peter Fassbender told media that the party reached out to them about the memberships on Jan. 26, two weeks later.
Fassbender added at the time that Stone had immediately requested a full investigation to determine what happened, and that they and the party both agreed that members with incomplete applications should not be permitted to vote.
At issue were 1,349 memberships associated with email addresses created by an employee of Aggregate IQ, a contractor hired by the Stone campaign, because they had been left blank on the new members' applications, according to the campaign.
The BC Liberal party eventually rejected those memberships as “incomplete,” under new rules drafted to address problems with bulk member signups.
However, in the statement issued Saturday, the Stone campaign said that after the Jan 12. warning it accepted responsibility for those email addresses, yet continued to push for the memberships to be accepted.

It said that later, on Jan. 26, the party advised it of more concerns regarding the email accounts; at a subsequent hearing on Jan. 28, the campaign said it withdrew its request for the memberships to be approved.
LISTEN: Membership allegations surrounding Todd Stone's campaign
On Friday, BC Liberal Party chief returning officer Geoff Plant issued a statement saying that the party's chief priority ahead of the vote was ensuring its integrity.
To that end, Plant said the party had introduced rigorous new authentication procedures, which included making thousands of audit phone calls to members to verify their information.
“Recent media reports are a reminder that the process has worked. Where membership applications did not meet the party's strict criteria, they were not accepted,” Plant wrote.

The problematic memberships came to light after four other leadership hopefuls wrote a letter to party executives demanding that allegations about rejected Stone campaign memberships be made public.
Stone's campaign responded by alleging the other candidates “feel they need to gang up” against them because their message was resonating.
The BC Liberal party had initially said that “all” campaigns had issues with membership sign-ups. It remains unclear how many memberships signed up by the other candidates campaigns were rejected.
Boğazkale in northern Anatolia's Çorum is historically known as Hattusa, which was the capital of Hittites for more than 450 years.
Now, traditional Hittite dolls made by housewives at Boğazkale public education centers have become the face of the historic city at events and the Tourism Week.
Çorum is one of Turkey's most important tourist destinations, thanks to its natural, historical and cultural riches. The region was home to historic civilizations like Hattians and Hittites, two important Anatolian civilizations.
The Boğazkale District Governorship is working to promote Hattusa, a national park a UNESCO World Heritage site since Nov. 28, 1986.
Çorum hosts the cultural heritage of Hattians and Hittites, two important Anatolian civilizations.
The city is known for its well preserved archaeological sites. In addition, the oldest known tablets written in the cuneiform script, one of the earliest writing systems, were also found in Hattusa. They are part of the UNESCO Memory of World List.
To preserve and promote the city's cultural heritage, the district governorship has opened handicraft courses where people, mainly women, learned to make traditional Hittite dolls.
Hittite bread and cookies
District Governor Turan Soğukoluk told Anadolu Agency (AA) that some 609 students have attended 42 courses at the city's Public Education Centers (HEM) this year. They have also paid the allowance to women who attended eight courses backed by the Turkish Employment Agency (İŞKUR).
They said that the Hittite doll making courses have created a bond between the town's women while improving their skills and allowing them to make contributions to the family income. "Our district is home to Hattusa, the capital of the Hittites. This site makes it historically important.
"We were thinking of ways to introduce Hattusa and our handcrafts and came up with the Hittite dolls project. We showcase and sell these dolls, which are mostly produced by local women. They follow the instruction in old Hittite documents. At the Tourism Week, their work received widespread recognition. Through this project we have introduced the Hittite civilization and helped the women contribute to family budgets," Soğukoluk said.
They added that they are also organizing courses on cheese and bread making. "We are also using old Hittite recipes to make bread and cookies. Everyone liked them a lot. We are planning to start mass production next year."
Hittite dolls with 32 pieces
Hatice Cemekli, a trainer at HEM, said the students especially dolls of figures like Hittite kings and queens.
They noted that they were inspired by old manuscripts and reliefs found in the city's archaeological site. "We make Hittite dolls that comprise of 32 different pieces. The figures include Tudhaliya IV and Queen Puduhepa as well as ordinary Hittite men and women. We designed clothes that reflect the era. I made small patterns on the clothes, and our students stitched them."
Hatice Pekşen, one of the students, said they were so happy to take the course. "It has improved my skills and now I can contribute to my family income," they said.
Want to improve housing affordability? Increase the homeowners exemption
Posted on August 14, 2017 by Sonoma Valley Sun
California is in a housing crisis. The cost of housing — both for purchase and rental housing — is too expensive. Ineffective public housing policies and anti-growth policies that impede even reasonable development projects have choked supply in a high-demand market. California needs to start building homes and apartments as soon as possible. Recent estimates show that California must build 180,000 units of housing a year over the next 10 years simply to keep pace with demand. Currently, only about half of that amount is being constructed.
But in the meantime, a quick and effective way to provide financial relief to everyone in California with a roof over their head is to increase the homeowners exemption which has been stuck at $7,000 since 1972. A lot has changed since then. Mark Spitz won a then-record seven gold medals in the 1972 Munich Olympics. Atari released the PONG computer game and a gallon of gas sold for 36 cents. California's population has nearly doubled from 21 million residents to 39 million residents today. And according to the California Association of Realtors, the median price of homes in California is well over $500,000 compared to $28,000 in 1972.
Because the average Californian earns $61,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, most are knocked out of the market before they even start. Only one-third of California residents can afford a median priced home.
In February, Assembly members Phil Chen and Matthew Harper introduced Assembly Bill 1100, the “American Dream Act,” which would increase the existing homeowners' exemption on their property tax from $7,000 to $25,000, as well as raising the renter's credit by using the mandated California Franchise Tax Board inflation adjustment. This will not only help current homeowners but this will help those aspiring to own a home. One-third of renters in the state spend at least half their take-home pay in rent, a statistic driving California's record high 20 percent poverty rate.
Californians are paying some of the highest taxes in the nation, exacerbating the ability of ordinary citizens to afford a home. Even with Proposition 13, which has proven effective in limiting the growth of homeowners' property tax bills, California still ranks in the top third of all states in per capita property tax revenue.
Moreover, high taxes and unaffordable housing are taking their toll on the California economy. In the last decade, California has lost more than 1 million people in net domestic out migration to other states. We all know at least a few people who have moved to Nevada, Texas, Oregon, Florida or Arizona to find a less expensive place to live.
In some welcome good news, in May, AB1100 passed a major hurdle by passing the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee with notable bipartisan support. This was the first time legislation of this nature got out of a legislative policy committee. Many had been attempted in years past but had failed.
When the Legislature returns from its summer recess later this month, affordable housing will be the leading topic of discussion. While there are many ideas being considered, including more bonds and taxes, ideas that provide direct relief for middle-class property owners have yet to rise to the forefront. They need to. Beyond the homeowners exemption, liberalizing the rules about taking one's Proposition 13 base-year value to a new residence, the so-called “portability” issue, should also be part of a legislative proposal.
Any reform package must articulate that government can't tax and bond its way out of a problem where it costs over $300,000 to build one unit of affordable housing. Addressing these regulatory burdens as well as providing tax relief for homeowners and renters will not only lead to future economic prosperity for California. It is also the right thing to do.

An investigation is underway after a two-alarm fire in Norwich Sunday night.
The fire was at a home on Orchard Street. It's unclear if anyone was home at the time or what may have caused the fire.

Sharjah - The second leg of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) commences at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium today (Wednesday) with defending champions Islamabad United taking on Quetta Gladiators in the only match of the day at 9:00 pm.
With the bombing that rocked Lahore, killing 13 people and injuring over 70 on Monday, the hopes of the organisers of taking the PSL to Pakistan now hang in the balance — and the organisers have left it to their cricket fans to decide where they want the final.
The organisers are willing to stage the final in Lahore even without the foreign players in the teams. Pakistan Super League (PSL) chairperson Najam Sethi said: “The foreign players have refused to play the final in Lahore after Monday's blast, but if the citizens of Pakistan want the final of PSL to be held in Lahore, despite foreign players not participating in the final, then the final will be held in Lahore.”
A top PSL official in Sharjah also confirmed to Gulf News that alternate arrangements are being made in the UAE for the final in case the showpiece is moved from Lahore. “We also need clearance from the government of Punjab in case we have to stage the final in Lahore. Security arrangements have to be in place for the final and hence government approval is vital,” they added.
The PSL authorities, before the start of the league, had held a meeting with foreign players to assure them of top security for the final. The Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (Fica) had criticised the PCB's decision to host the final in Lahore. Incidentally, the Fica circulated a memo to players and players' associations stating that there is ‘an extremely elevated' risk level in Pakistan.
Speaking to Gulf News, Sethi had said: “We want to encourage foreign players to come to Lahore... once we have the final in Lahore that will be the window that will open up for more cricket in Pakistan.”
The PSL had also been rocked by a few players attempting to corrupt the tournament by engaging in spot fixing. On Monday night, the PCB (PCB) provisionally suspended Nasir Jamshed, the former opener, from all forms of cricket due to a violation of its anti-corruption code.
Earlier, the PCB had provisionally suspended Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif from PSL for not reporting an offer from an international betting syndicate and they were flown into Pakistan for questioning. The Pakistan Anti Corruption Unit, which was trailing the syndicate, revealed the wrongdoing of the players. Islamabad United's Mohammad Irfan, Quetta Gladiators' Zulfiqar Babar and Shahzaib Hasan of the Karachi Kings were also questioned in connection with the incident but were allowed to play in the tournament.
Jamshed had played in two Tests, both against South Africa in February 2013, besides featuring in 48 ODIs and 18 T20 internationals.  They are alleged to be the go-between man linked with the international betting syndicate and the players.
As for the opening match in Sharjah, the Quetta and Islamabad teams have trained hard. Ticket sales for the double header on Friday and Saturday have increased and a packed stadium is set to witness the Sharjah matches.

REUTERS: For nearly 50 years, the Oroville Dam has provided a water lifeline to residents across the state of California. But for the community in its shadow, the dam has been a source of contention and legal battles.
Weeks of winter storms triggered the near collapse of two of the dam's spillways this past week and temporary evacuation of nearly 190,000 residents.
The crisis also brought to the surface lingering and looming problems faced by the local community.
Butte County and green groups have fought the relicensing of the Oroville Dam for more than a decade. They argue federal regulators and the courts should require the state to better fortify the emergency spillway, to reimburse the county for dam-related costs, and to more carefully examine the effects of climate change on the dam.
Oroville's reservoir plays a vital role in capturing water from California's rainy, mountainous north and distributing it to agricultural lands, industrial tracts, and homes from the Bay Area to Southern California. But the community downstream says the benefits were not returned to Butte County.
In 2005, Butte County filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which licenses the dam, to intervene in the state's application to grant a new 50-year licence.
“For many years the costs to provide services to the project have outweighed the tourism benefits,” the county argued at the time. The dam's recreation facilities had become "a magnet for crime, vandalism, trash dumping" that the county regularly had to police and cleanup.
The nation's tallest dam created a job boom for the region during its construction in the 1960s. But once the project was completed, unemployment spiked and new homes were abandoned.
In the decades since, Butte County argued it lost US$267 million in potential taxes on the now-submerged land under reservoir. The county estimated it spends US$4.8 million annually on expenses related to the dam. The state's Department of Water Resources, which operates the dam, calculated the county's losses were less, but still reached over US$500,000 annually, according to a 2007 environmental study.
Conservation groups Friends of the River and the Sierra Club also raised issues, requesting that the dam's relicensing be contingent on stronger fortification of the emergency spillway - which nearly failed this week.
“We were told repeatedly that the spillways and the dam were all just fine,” said Friends of the River's Executive Director Eric Wesselman. “The events unfolding at Oroville should be a wake-up call that there are thousands of unsafe dams and levees in the country."
FERC consultants dismissed concerns about the emergency spillway in a 2006 memo. But on Monday, the federal agency requested an independent "forensic analysis to determine both the cause of the spillway failure and whether it could occur again.”
FERC spokesperson Celeste Miller would not say how the damaged spillways impacted the state's application to relicense the dam.
In 2008, Butte County also sued the state's Department of Water Resources, accusing it of avoiding a rigorous assessment of the effects of climate change on the dam.
The lawsuit came three years after Governor Jerry Brown warned that climate change threatened to “greatly reduce the Sierra snowpack, one of the state's primary sources of water.”
The state needs to consider the wild swings in climate conditions, not just the effects of drought, when re-evaluating the safety of dams, said Butte County Counsel Bruce Albert.
"I don't know what's coming in the future, but they haven't studied it," Albert said.
The state says it completed a climate analysis over a decade ago. In 2012, a judge ruled against Butte County, writing that "current climate change science does not allow for project-specific forecasting," and the state's environmental study "should not be based on speculation."
The county appealed. The case is now before California 3rd District Court of Appeals.

SINGAPORE: An odd-job worker was on Wednesday (Feb 15) charged with animal cruelty for allegedly killing their pet dog, a Maltese named Sweet Sweet.
Chong Choom Kiat allegedly used a cloth and leash to strangle the female dog before stabbing it to death in their flat at Block 679 Hougang Avenue 8 on Oct 30, 2016.
The 39-year-old also faces a second charge because the Maltese did not have a valid license from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA).
According to AVA regulations, all dogs must be licensed for rabies control.
In court on Wednesday, Chong said they intended to apply for legal aid. They added that their wife was in a nursing home and asked for time to make arrangements for them care.
They will next appear in court on Mar 1.
If found guilty of animal cruelty, Chong could be jailed for up to 18 months and fined S$15,000. For keeping an unlicensed dog, they face a fine of up to S$5,000.

KINSHASA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Congo has reinstated a value added tax on mining company imports, the chamber of mines said on Saturday, part of what miners say is a deteriorating business climate in the country.
Democratic Republic of Congo's government agreed to suspend the tax in July 2016 to help companies during a commodity price downturn, and to pay down hundreds of millions of dollars in VAT reimbursements owed to the companies.
Major mining companies in Congo include Glencore, Randgold Resources and China Molybdenum.
Now the government is desperate to increase tax revenue in the face of severe economic problems and stubbornly low commodity prices. The franc has lost over 30 percent of its value in the past year and the central bank has about three weeks' left of import cover.
Economic problems have been exacerbated by deep unrest across the country caused by President Joseph Kabila's failure to arrange elections in time for when their mandate expired in December.
The decree suspending VAT was valid for one year, John Nkono, secretary general of the industry-led Chamber of Mines, told Reuters. The chamber had informed the government of the expiration date in July but has not heard back.
They added that the government owes mining companies about $700 million on VAT reimbursement going back several years.
In a draft letter to Finance Minister Henri Yav seen by Reuters, the president of Congo's Chamber of Commerce, Albert Yuma, said reinstating the VAT tax would "make the functioning of mining companies more difficult".
They added that companies "need the help of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo during this constraining period."
Yav could not be immediately reached for comment. The finance ministry was not available. (Reporting By Aaron Ross, additional reporting by Patient Ligodi; Editing by Edward McAllister and David Evans)
TORONTO – Curtis Granderson hit a solo shot off Craig Kimbrel in the 10th inning to give the Toronto Blue Jays a 4-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night at Rogers Centre.
Granderson belted a 2-0 pitch for a no-doubt shot to deep right field. It was their third homer of the season and fourth career walkoff blast.
The Red Sox have lost three in a row but still own the best record in the major leagues at 17-5. The Blue Jays (14-8) moved three games behind Boston in the American League East division standings.

Toronto right-hander Tyler Clippard worked one inning of relief for the victory.
The Red Sox tied the game in the ninth inning by scoring two runs off Blue Jays closer Roberto Osuna.
Eduardo Nunez drove in Hanley Ramirez to make it a one-run game and Brock Holt delivered a two-out single to bring Rafael Devers home with the tying run. Nunez tried to score on the play but Granderson threw them out at home to prevent Boston from taking the lead.

Toronto starter J.A. Happ deserved better than a no-decision after striking out 10 batters over seven innings. They allowed one earned run, four hits and did not issue a walk.
The Blue Jays put three runs on the board in the second inning. Devers, the Boston third baseman, had a rough frame and Toronto took full advantage.
With runners on the corners, Kevin Pillar hit a grounder to third but Devers was wide with their throw home to allow Steve Pearce to score.
Granderson hit a sharp grounder later in the frame that handcuffed Devers after it hit the seam where the turf meets the dirt infield. The ball bounced behind Devers and as they retrieved it, Aledmys Diaz and Devon Travis scampered home.

Happ rolled through the first five frames before the Red Sox got on the board in the sixth. Holt led off with a double and scored on a Ramirez flare that dropped in front of Pillar in centre field.
Boston starter Rick Porcello also worked seven innings. They gave up three earned runs, three hits, three walks and had nine strikeouts.
Ryan Tepera threw a scoreless eighth inning for Toronto before Osuna's first blown save of the season. Osuna allowed four hits and walked a batter over their 31-pitch outing.
Announced attendance was 20,070 and the game took two hours 51 minutes to play.
Before the game, the Blue Jays honoured the victims of Monday's deadly van attack in north Toronto.
Players from both teams stood in front of the dugouts for a moment of silence. Toronto police officers and paramedics were recognized for their efforts and a banner reading ‘#TorontoStrong' hung from the 200 level above the wall in centre field.
Notes: Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said they expect to provide an update Wednesday on plans for slugger Josh Donaldson. The third baseman is on the disabled list with a shoulder injury but is expected to return soon. … Snowboarder Laurie Blouin threw out the ceremonial first pitch. They won a silver medal in women's slopestyle at the Pyeongchang Olympics last February. … Aaron Sanchez (1-2, 3.86) is scheduled to start Wednesday night against Boston's Eduardo Rodriguez (2-0, 3.45).
TORONTO – Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne sued the Opposition leader for defamation Monday, less than six months away from the provincial election.
The legal action stems from comments Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown made in September, a day before Wynne testified as a witness at a trial in Sudbury, Ont., involving two provincial Liberals facing Election Act bribery charges.
Brown told reporters they hoped Wynne would give answers about the scandal “maybe when they stand trial” and went on to describe them as a “sitting premier, sitting in trial.”

The Tory leader refused to apologize for the statements both after an initial letter from Wynne's lawyer and following a libel notice in October.
Their lawyer has said the statements were not defamatory.
Wynne's spokesperson said a statement of claim was filed in court Monday to preserve the premier's ability to continue with the legal case.

“We continue to remain hopeful that this issue can be resolved with an apology from Patrick Brown for their defamatory remarks,” Jenn Beaudry wrote. “It should be that simple. However, if they continue to refuse to apologize we will have the ability to continue legal action.”
Brown has suggested the previous legal threat was an attempt to distract the public from Liberal scandals. They said they would ignore Wynne's attempts “to silence Them Majesty's Loyal Opposition.”
The two Liberals on trial in Sudbury were ultimately acquitted.
Federer sparks injury concerns as Zverev storms to Rogers Cup title
Alexander Zverev played superbly to win the Rogers Cup, but there appeared to be an injury concern for Roger Federer.
by Omnisport News 14 Aug 2017, 03:27 IST
Alexander Zverev during the Rogers Cup final
Roger Federer suffered only their third defeat in 2017 and appeared to be hampered by a possible injury as Alexander Zverev underlined their status as the brightest young star in tennis with a straight-sets victory in the Rogers Cup final.
Still only 20, Zverev produced a polished display in Montreal to triumph 6-3 6-4 - the young German's power and precision hugely impressive throughout.
However, Federer looked to be well short of their physical best as the match drew to a close, their lack of mobility prompting concern with the US Open looming.
Federer could reclaim the world number one ranking next week in Cincinnati, but it remains to be seen if the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion will be fit to play.
Zverev, meanwhile, has now claimed two Masters 1000 titles in 2017 and appears destined to win many more in the future.

The German, who saved three match points in their tournament-opening victory over Richard Gasquet, dictated proceedings early on and saw their early pressure rewarded with a 4-1 lead.
After a brief wobble as they looked to see out the first set, Zverev moved ahead thanks to some strong serving.
Both players raised their level and were forced to save break points at the start of set two, Zverev winning one particularly stunning rally in the midst of the match's most engrossing period.
Yet Federer appeared to struggle physically thereafter and Zverev was able to cruise to the winning line, denying the Swiss a 17th victory in succession.
