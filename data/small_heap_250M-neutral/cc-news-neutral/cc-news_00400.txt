CHUMPHON – A trawler helped bring 45 tourists and crew members to safety on Monday after their boat hit an object under the sea during a sightseeing trip to an island.
The Racha Chumphon boat lost control due to high waves and its bottom was cracked after hitting a hard object underwater when it was about two kilometres off the coast in Pathiu district, Taweechai Choksamut, the marine office chief in the province said.

Baseball: Tribe's road record drops to 3-12
William and Mary had two mid-week games Tuesday and Wednesday in Norfolk against Old Dominion and Norfolk State, respectively. The College's struggles on the road continued, with its record dropping to 3-12 on the year with losses in both games. The Tribe fell to Old Dominion for the second time in as many games this year, 6-3, and lost 9-3 to the Spartans the following night after beating them at Plumeri Park earlier this year.
Tuesday, the Tribe (18-16) took the field against the Monarchs (25-9), seeking revenge for an 11-6 defeat at home a few weeks earlier. Senior pitcher Chase Bailey started on the mound for the College, while the Monarchs sent out southpaw John Wilson for the start. The Tribe got off to a slow start, failing to score in each of the first four innings and falling behind early by way of a leadoff solo home run by third baseman Nick Walker in the bottom of the first inning.
Old Dominion maintained their 1-0 advantage until the top of the fifth inning when the Tribe managed to get on the board and take its first lead of the game. Senior center fielder Charles Ameer led off the inning with a single into left field. The next batter, senior designated hitter Ryder Miconi, roped a double into right center field, allowing Ameer to cross the plate for the game-tying run. Miconi was credited with the RBI on the play. After two consecutive outs, sophomore third baseman Zach Pearson stepped up to the plate for the College. Pearson came through with an RBI single through the right side that plated Miconi for the go-ahead run. The Tribe headed back out on defense with its first lead of the night, 2-1.
The College was unable to hold its lead for very long. The Monarchs bounced back with a four-run inning in the bottom of the fifth to take a 5-2 lead which they would not relinquish for the rest of the game. With one out and nobody on, the Tribe's defense began to falter. Walker reached base safely on error, before advancing to second on yet another error, this time on a pick-off attempt. The defensive woes continued as sophomore shortstop Kyle Wrighte made their second error of the inning, allowing second baseman Jared Young to get to first base safely, with Walker advancing to third on the play. The next batter, shortstop Zach Rutherford, blasted a double to right center field, scoring both Walker and Young. After a walk and a hit-by-pitch, center fielder Culver Lamb came to the plate with the bases loaded. They delivered with a two-RBI double to extend the Monarchs' lead to 5-2. The Tribe was unable to recover after that inning and ultimately fell 6-3.
Wednesday, the College returned to the diamond, looking to complete a season sweep of Norfolk State (15-14). The Tribe jumped out to a quick lead with a three-run inning in the top of the first. Sophomore right fielder Owen Socher drew a leadoff walk and advanced to third on a single up the middle by Wrighte. Socher scored on a sacrifice fly to the center fielder by junior left fielder Ryan Hall, putting the Tribe up 1-0. The next batter, Miconi, ripped a two-run home run to right field, also scoring Wrighte on the play. The College came out from the bottom of the first with a 3-0 cushion.
In the bottom of the first inning, the Spartans put up three runs of their own to even the game once again. The Tribe would not hold another lead the rest of the night. With a man on second and two outs, the Spartans' offense came to life. Second baseman Alex Mauricio stroked a single into right field, scoring center fielder Andre Moore on the play to cut the deficit to 3-1. After a walk, an error and a stolen base, Norfolk State had men on second and third for third baseman Justin Burrell, who laced a two-RBI single into center field, tying the game at 3-3.
The Spartans grabbed the lead for the first time with a huge four-run fifth inning. With a man on third and one out, Moore reached base on a bunt single, with shortstop Johnny Mayer scoring the go-ahead run on the play for the Spartans. Later in the inning, with the bases loaded and the score still 4-3, Moore dashed home to extend the lead to 5-3 on a wild pitch. First baseman Roger Hall then hit an RBI single to push the lead to three runs. A second wild pitch cost the Tribe yet another run later in the inning, and the Spartans were able to take a 7-3 lead. They added on two more runs in the sixth inning and left with a 9-3 victory over the College.
The Tribe had a quick turnaround due to the holiday weekend, starting its weekend series one day early, on Thursday. The College travelled to Johnson City, Tenn., for a matchup against East Tennessee State, looking to bounce back from its two mid-week losses and improve its 3-12 record on the road.
The College fell to East Tennessee State in a complete sweep, falling to 18-19 in the season.

The Turkish delegation at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) left the April session after former Democratic Union Party (PYD) Co-chair Salih Muslum was invited to give a speech at a side-event.
"To register my protest on the attendance of the terrorist Salih Muslum at an event organized by PACE, I am leaving the April session of the Parliamentary Assembly and returning to Turkey," Akif Çagatay Kılıç, head of the Turkish delegation, said in a statement. Ankara considers the PYD the Syrian affiliate of the PKK terrorist group.
Muslum was protected by French police on their way to the Council of Europe and throughout the event. "I condemn this event which conflicts with the values and standards of the Council of Europe," Kılıç said.
Kılıç's statement also underlined that Muslum was a terrorist, against whom legal proceedings are underway.
The event, "Turkish Invasion of Afrin: An Urgent Humanitarian Crisis," was organized through an initiative of the Unified European Left's (UEL) group president.
Salih Muslum joined the PYD in 2003 and served as its co-chair between 2010 and 2017. In September 2017, they were replaced by Shahoz Hassan.  They are sought by Turkish authorities with a red notice abroad for their role in the planning of a terrorist attack carried out in Ankara in 2016.
The March 13, 2016 attack at Güvenpark in Ankara's Kızılay area, a popular shopping district, was carried out using an explosives-laden vehicle and left 37 dead and dozens injured.
Muslum was also detained in the Czech Republic earlier this year. A Czech court ruled for the release of the terrorist leader. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry condemned the ruling at the time, saying it displays the insincerity of European countries regarding the fight against terrorism.
Some members of the Turkish delegation will remain at PACE to support the proposed amendments to be given with respect to particular reports referring to Turkey, which are expected to be adopted during the General Assembly session.
The Winkler Fire Department responded to a leak of a natural gas line Monday evening.
Crews were called to the scene on Marigold Bay around 7:00 pm.
Fire Chief Richard Paetzold says the cause of the leak was due to a resident digging in a garden with a spade.
Residents from about 12 homes in the immediate area were evacuated for a short while until it was deemed safe to go back.
The fire department stayed on scene to monitor the situation until hydro arrived to repair the gas line.
Meanwhile, Paetzold reminds residents to always "call before you dig."
Senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav is set to present their faction as the "real" party claiming that many of its state units are with them while the support for party president Nitish Kumar is confined to Bihar.The Yadav-led faction, which includes two Rajya Sabha MPs and some national office-bearers, has armed itself with letters of support from 14 state unit presidents, Arun Shrivastava, a close aide of Yadav said. Kumar recently removed Yadav from the post of party's general secretary.To counter Kumar's assertion that the JD(U) is recognised only in Bihar-- a point made to debunk claims of support from other state units by the Yadav faction-- Shrivastava claimed the party always had a national footprint.He said it was Yadav who headed the party before Kumar had merged their Samata Party with it."We will not leave the party. Nitish Kumar themselves says that the party does not exist outside Bihar. Then they should form a new party for Bihar. They should not try to capture the JD(U) which always had a national presence," they told PTI.The 'Janata Parivar', a reference to various parties with socialist ethos, has a history of mergers and splits.Yadav enjoys little support from the party's lawmakers, who are overwhelmingly from Bihar, but believes that they can make a fight of their claim over the party and cause a split.The original Janata Dal had seen several such splits at in the past.Two Rajya Sabha members, Ali Anwar Ansari and M P Veerendra Kumar, are seen to be with Yadav in their fight against Kumar.The JD(U) has removed Yadav as the leader of its parliamentary party in the Rajya Sabha.It has also made light of their claims of having the real JD(U) with him, saying that it is RJD workers and supporters who have greeted them during their tour in Bihar while its workers have kept away.During their visit to the national capital on Friday, Kumar had virtually shut the door on any reconciliation with Yadav, saying they are free to take any decision as the alliance with the BJP had the entire party's nod."He (Yadav) is free to take their decision. As far as the party is concerned, it has already taken its decision. The decision was not mine alone and it was taken with the consent of the party. If they keep a different opinion, then they are free to do so," Nitish had told reporters.
The head of Oregon's Office of Emergency Management is apologizing after their agency sent a vague wireless emergency alert without "specific information we had meant to send" about Salem's contaminated drinking water advisory.
"This was a failure on our part," Andrew Phelps, director of the emergency agency, said in a video posted to social media.
Phelps said the integrated public alert and warning system "inadvertently defaulted to a generic message." They said agency officials rushed to give updates on social media and manually override the generic message, pushing another alert with information on the water advisory.

Salem city officials on Tuesday released a do-not-drink advisory after low levels of toxins were discovered in city drinking water from the North Santiam River.
The advisory is for children younger than 6 years old and vulnerable populations, including dialysis patients and those with compromised immune systems. Officials say there is no danger for healthy adults drinking the water, which is also used in other towns, including Stayton and Turner.
Q&A: 11 questions answered on Salem's water warning
Bottled water: State, city officials won't supply water as Salem contamination alert drags on
Advisory: Salem drinking water contaminated, children shouldn't drink tap water
The advisory set off a run on bottled water a local grocery stores, and city officials remain unsure when the warning will be lifted.
In an interview Wednesday with the Statesman Journal, Phelps said Tuesday marked the first time ever the state had used its wireless emergency alert system.
"As soon as we saw it on our own phones, yeah, we knew pretty quickly that it did not work the way we had expected it to work," they said.
Phelps said a senior IT staff member trained on the emergency alert system typed in the message with approval from an executive duty officer, they said.
For the alert, the city of Salem had adapted language from the Oregon Health Authority.
Marion County did not send the alert because it doesn't have that ability, so the Marion Area Multi-Agency Emergency Telecommunications Dispatch Center in Woodburn was asked to send it, said Jolene Kelley, spokesperson for Marion County.
However, a technical issue stopped the dispatch center from being able to send it, so the Office of Emergency Management was contacted as a backup, Kelley said.
"Generally these messages ... get sent out at the local level or if it's a weather issue, they get sent out by the National Weather Service," Phelps said. "So, this was the first time we've ever initiated a wireless emergency alert. Usually it's something that the locals handle."
Phelps said no testing options exist for the wireless alerts, though the television and radio alert system is tested weekly. They said officials are trained on the emergency alert system via Federal Emergency Management Agency trainings posted online.
Oregon's Office of Emergency Management Director Andrew Phelps apologizes in a video posted on the agency's Facebook page.
OEM
Phelps said the wireless alert went to phones within the area served by the affected water system, while another alert went to television and radio broadcasters that serve the affected area.
"We are conducting a forensic analysis of the steps we took to send this message and to ensure our procedures are written and practiced in a way that will prevent confusing messages from being sent ... in the future," Phelps said.
The Office of Emergency Management said in an earlier statement Tuesday: "This was a technology issue which OEM is currently working to learn how and why it happened."
Policy expert Jim Moore pointed to similarities between Oregon's blunder and an incident earlier this year when an emergency alert in Hawaii warned of a ballistic missile strike that sparked massive panic.
"Just like Hawaii and the missile alert, there is work to do," said Moore, director of the Tom McCall Center for Policy Innovation at Pacific University.
"Whether this was software, human error, or confused communications, the first message just created a mild form of panic. It is the job of OEM's communications to actually communicate to the public, not confuse it," Moore said.
Still, Moore said, clearer communications in the past have spurred other problems, such as an incident in the 1980s where a tsunami warning for areas along the coast drew spectators from the Willamette Valley wanting to see the event.
"This points out the problem," Moore said. "It is not just the quality of communication from OEM, it is the listeners' abilities to act appropriately on that information that will determine how people deal with the 'big one,' out there somewhere off the coast."

Formula 1 racing will move back to ESPN beginning with the 2018 season it was announced on Wednesday.
ESPN and ABC will televise all 21 races in the championship. The first Formula 1 race ever aired in the U.S. was on ABC in 1962.
Beginning with the season-opening Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix on March 25, and ending with the Nov. 25 Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, all of the races will air live in the United States on either ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC. More than 125 hours of Formula 1 programming, including all practice sessions, qualifying and races, will air live and in replay across ESPN platforms in 2018.
“ESPN has had a long commitment to motorsports, and Formula 1 is a crown jewel in the sport,” said Burke Magnus, ESPN executive vice president of programming & scheduling. “There are many passionate Formula 1 fans in the U.S. and we look forward to bringing the pageantry, spectacle and excitement of F1 to viewers across the ESPN platform.”
Among the season highlights will be the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday, May 27 (Memorial Day weekend in the U.S.), which will air live on ESPN at 7:55 a.m. ET and re-air later in the day on ABC at 3:30 p.m. after the Indianapolis 500. The United States Grand Prix in Austin, Tex., on Oct. 21 and the Mexican Grand Prix on Oct. 28 also will air live on ABC while the Canadian Grand Prix (June 10) and British Grand Prix (July 8) will be featured live on ESPN. The Singapore Grand Prix, the only night race of the championship, will air on ESPN2 on Sept. 16.
“We are excited about the return of the world's foremost motor racing platform to the ABC and ESPN platforms,” said Sean Bratches, managing director, commercial operations at Formula 1. “ABC's Wide World of Sports first started airing live grands prix in the early 1960's and this linear and digital partnership with ESPN represents a significant step forward in achieving Formula 1's aim of broadening the sport's appeal. The U.S. market is very important growth opportunity for Formula 1 and we are looking forward to working with ESPN to ignite the growing fan interest.”
Formula 1 made its debut on American television with the airing of highlights from the Monaco Grand Prix on ABC's Wide World of Sports on June 10, 1962, one week after the race was run. Select races appeared on ABC until 1988. ESPN began televising F1 races with a 10-race schedule in 1984, expanding to 14 races from 1985-1988, and then 15 from 1989-1993. ESPN aired 16 races in 1994, then a high of 17 in 1995, followed by 16 in both 1996 and 1997, the last years the championship appeared on ESPN.
During the final decade of Johnny Cash's career, the legendary musician collaborated with famed producer Rick Rubin to record a series of raw, stripped-down albums. The resulting material was released posthumously in November 2003 as a box set entitled, Unearthed, with recordings ranging from stark balladry to punchy rockabilly to heartfelt gospel to classic covers. Now, the collection has received its first ever vinyl release, available November 3rd on Rubin's American Recordings.
(Read: The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time)
The expansive box set has 79 songs spread out over nine 180-gram vinyl LPs. It's housed in a LP-sized black cloth slipcase containing a pair of cloth-bound books. The first book holds the nine LPs. The other is a 60-page coffee table book incorporating Sylvie Simmons' extensive liner notes drawn from five days of interviews at Cash's home in Tennessee. It also includes Cash and Rubin's commentary on every song in the set, as well as some of the last photos ever taken of the singer from the recording sessions.
Unearthed is divided into five thematic sections. Who's Gonna Cry focuses on acoustic solo recordings and revisits several classic songs from Cash's extensive catalog. Trouble In Mind is oriented towards electric performances and features guest appearances by Tom Petty, Willie Nelson, Carl Perkins, and members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as well as Cash's wife and longtime duet partner, June Carter Cash. Redemption Songs is largely acoustic and features duets with Joe Strummer, Fiona Apple, Nick Cave, and Glen Campbell. My Mother's Hymn Book demonstrates Cash's lifelong affinity for gospel music by encompassing 15 time-honored gospel standards. Best of Cash On American offers a 15-song selection of highlights from Cash's first four albums with Rubin.

The history of Turkish archery is now on display in the "Turkish Archery Exhibition" in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. The exhibition, organized by the Archers Foundation of Turkey, will be open until May 5.Held under the auspices of Turkey's Embassy in Belgrade in cooperation with the Yunus Emre Institute, the exhibition's opening was overseen by Serbian Culture and Information Minister Vladan Vukosavljevic, Commerce, Tourism and Telecommunication Minister Rasim Ljajic, the World Etnospor (Ethnic Sports) Confederation President Bilal Erdoğan, Turkey's Archers Foundation's Haydar Ali Yıldız, Turkey's Ambassador to Belgrade Tanju Bilgiç and Yunus Emre Institute President Şeref Ateş.
Speaking during the opening, Erdoğan said nations have often used their common histories as excuses to start conflicts, but Turkey and Serbia are demonstrating that common history can also be used to promote love and brotherhood.
"Serbia and Turkey have used their shared history of more than 500 years for the good of both nations and strengthen both countries," they said.
Traditional Turkish archery's roots date back to the first millennium B.C. to the Scythians, Huns and other early Asian archery traditions. The mounted archers of the Central Asian steppes have used similar archery tackle and fighting strategies throughout history. However, Turkish archery evolved during the Ottoman Empire after the Archers Foundation was established by Sultan Mehmed II - also known as Mehmed the Conqueror - in 1453.
Rep. Tim Ryan, who plays shortstop on the Democratic congressional baseball team, had a chilling thought as they and other players huddled in the dugout at Gallaudet University in northeastern D.C. awaiting word of when they could safely leave the field.
At first, "we didn't know a whole lot other than a handful of people were hit," the Ohio Democrat said in an interview.
Ryan said as they sheltered, players learned that GOP Majority Whip Steve Scalise had been shot, and that it was Scalise's protective detail that stopped the shooter. Ryan said their thoughts immediately went to the lone Capitol Police officer who parks in the lot near the field during practices.
"If Scalise had breakfast or something else this morning and wasn't there, you would have had 15 or 20 dead members of congress and 10 dead staff people. There is nothing that would have stopped this guy," Ryan said.
Eventually a sniper team arrived and surrounded the area to allow lawmakers to leave the dugout with protection, they said.
Just as disturbing for Ryan was the fact that Rep. Joe Barton's children were in the dugout during the shooting. "It's just unbelievable to think about," they said.
Their own children have helped with the team in years past, and many members bring their families to town for the event.
Organizers of the annual Congressional Baseball Game have not yet said what will happen tomorrow night when the match is scheduled to take place at Nationals Park. But Ryan said members of Congress are hoping the game is still on.
"We're encouraging even more people to come," they said.
Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill on Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling the blood bank that they are HIV-positive.
Modern medicine allows those with HIV to live longer lives and nearly eliminates the possibility of transmission, according to state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and Assemblyman Todd Gloria (D-San Diego), authors of the bill.
“Today California took a major step toward treating HIV as a public health issue, instead of treating people living with HIV as criminals,” Wiener said in a statement. “HIV should be treated like all other serious infectious diseases, and that's what SB 239 does.”
Brown declined comment on their action.
HIV has been the only communicable disease for which exposure is a felony under California law. The current law, Wiener argued, may convince people not to be tested for HIV because without a test they cannot be charged with a felony if they expose a partner to the infection.
“We are going to end new HIV infections, and we will do so not by threatening people with state prison time, but rather by getting people to test and providing them access to care,” Wiener said.
Supporters of the bill said women engaging in prostitution are disproportionately targeted with criminal charges, even in cases where the infection is not transmitted.
Republican lawmakers including Sen. Joel Anderson of San Diego voted against the bill, arguing it puts the public at risk.
“I'm of the mind that if you purposefully inflict another with a disease that alters their lifestyle the rest of their life, puts them on a regimen of medications to maintain any kind of normalcy, it should be a felony,” Anderson said during the floor debate. “It's absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this.”
Anderson said the answer could be to extend tougher penalties to those who expose others to other infectious diseases.
Penticton resident Monique Bolduc is speaking out about what they call a moving “ordeal” as they continue to find damaged and water-logged items while they unpack from a recent move.
“It was in one piece but it's no longer in one piece …I'm not quite sure if we can fix that …and this is cracked,” they said while showing Global News the damaged items in their new home.
Bolduc and their husband hired Victoria-based moving company “2 Burley Men Moving Ltd.” for their long-haul move but were in for a long-haul themselves when their belongings arrived more than 24 hours late.
“Nobody knew where my things were, but if they're supposed to be there “they'll be there” well they never showed up,” they said. “When my things did finally arrive they were in a budget truck… I could have cried.”
Bolduc said $400.00 was taken off the bill but to make matters worse they were forced to pay the rest – $2000.00 — before the movers would unload the truck and they could evaluate any potential damage.
“I have a missing dolly, a missing piece of glass… here they are talking about my furniture [it] has multiple nicks on the wood items, legs are broken, top is chipped,” Bolduc said while holding the contract with the company.
Owner of 2 Burley Men, Scott Burley, said some of the claims are legitimate but items not covered by insurance are clearly stipulated in the “terms and conditions.”
“We do have every customer sign a disclaimer on what we insure. Monique did sign their disclaimer. For insurance there is [sic] a few things we do not insure for long-haul moving or local moves in general. One of them is press board furniture and things that are not packaged properly,” Burley said from Victoria.
But Bolduc claims none of their furniture is pressboard, which is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, sawmill shavings, or sawdust.
“We actually read their clauses before moving and every article of press board furniture in the house was sold before moving,” they said.
Burley added payment up-front for long-haul moves is an industry-wide standard.
“All jobs are paid for upon delivery as we are outside of our local area and have no recourse if the bill can't be paid,” they said.
49 complaints have been filed with the Better Business Bureau against 2 Burley Men Moving Ltd.
Burley said the complaints were filed over a three year period or 16 per year.
“We do on average just over 15,000 moves per year so that is a tenth of one per cent of our moves. We are not perfect, this is customer service, but a tenth of one per cent, we are actually quite happy with our rating and our complaints.” Burley said.
Bolduc is warning other consumers to do their due diligence.
“A lot of people say you get what you pay for and in this circumstance I didn't get what I paid for but I did pay more than 50 per cent less than all of my other quotes so I guess that saying is quite fitting.”
The moving company said customers also need to do their part.
“The consumer has equal responsibility to make sure that their product is packed properly,” Burley said.
The understudy is ready for a leading role. That was evident last season when Chargers rookie tight end Hunter Henry, a second-round pick out of Arkansas in 2016, caught 36 passes for 478 yards and eight touchdowns and was an effective blocker in the running game.
The star is not ready to yield the spotlight. Antonio Gates, who turns 37 on Sunday, is back for their 15th NFL season, needing one scoring catch to break Tony Gonzalez's record of 111 touchdown receptions for a tight end, and they showed little slippage while catching 53 passes for 548 yards and seven touchdowns last season.
So what gives?
Nothing if you're the Chargers, who stand to benefit by having Gates, a probable Hall of Famer, and Henry, one of football's best young tight ends, share the position when the team moves to Los Angeles this season.
“We can both contribute a lot together,” Henry, 22, said after Wednesday's practice, part of a three-day mandatory minicamp that ends Thursday. “I'm ready to take on a bigger role, I'm confident in my abilities, but he's proved themselves for 14 years; I've proved it for one. I'm trying to get to that level. I'm trying to learn from them every single day.”
The 6-foot-5, 250-pound Henry described as “unbelievable” the experience of serving an NFL apprenticeship under Gates, who has caught 897 passes for 11,192 yards during their distinguished career.
“He's gonna go down as one of the greatest tight ends to ever play football,” Henry said. “He's an awesome guy — easy to learn from, easy to watch, easy to pick things up from.”
On the field, Henry watches how Gates reads defenses and sets up routes for later in games, how they position their hands and feet on certain blocks, and how he's able to “slow the game down.”
Off the field, Henry is learning how to “treat your body as a business,” how to prevent injuries by taking ice baths, stretching and warming up properly and how to mentally prepare for each work day.
“It's a physical game,” said Henry, who tied Tampa Bay's Cameron Brate for most touchdowns for a tight end in 2016. “You have to be ready to go each and every Sunday.”
Gates stresses the importance of maintaining focus and not thinking success as a rookie will guarantee success as a sophomore.
“You see so many players come in and have one or two big years, and then they lose focus,” Gates said. “I personally think you should treat every year like your first, because when you come into something, you're not established. You have to prove to everyone, ‘This is what I can do. This is who I am.'
“Sometimes, when guys have success — and I don't see this in him, because he's a very level-headed kid, a very hard worker — but I've seen guys lose their focus. It's something I continue to talk to my kids about. Do what you know is right, and what got you to that level.”
First-year Chargers coach Anthony Lynn has “no doubt Henry can be a No. 1,” but Gates and Henry are more of a 1 and 1A in the eyes of offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt. The Chargers run plenty of two-tight-end packages and can base playing-time decisions on which tight end better fits a particular defense.
“It worked pretty good last year — both of them were productive, and we're going to try to utilize both this season,” Whisenhunt said. “It's good to see Antonio out here. He's looking good. But we're not going to ignore the fact that Hunter is really coming along as a young tight end in the league.
“I'm sure there will be times when both are on the field, and there will be other plays where we're trying to work them in. When you've got guys like that, it's a good problem to have when you're trying to balance all those things.”
Nuts and Bolts
Lynn had stern words for the Chargers after Tuesday's practice, which the coach described as “sluggish” and filled with mistakes and fouls. They were much more pleased with Wednesday's effort. “The energy was back, the defense had a really good day,” Lynn said. “The offense made some plays, but the defense was on top of it. Guys were stripping the ball out, running to the ball and getting pass breakups.” ... During the red-zone portion of Wednesday's practice, 35-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers, who is not known for their mobility, ran a read-option play. “I think it's always fun to do those kinds of things in OTAs,” Whisenhunt said. “You'll probably see less of that in-season, but you never know. If he's feeling frisky one day, we may take a shot at it.” … Chargers owner Dean Spanos attended Wednesday's practice.

Transit across northern B.C. was key issue raised repeatedly during last fall's hearings in Smithers
The British Columbia government has released a snapshot of the results of its transportation upgrades along Highway 16, the route also known as the Highway of Tears.
The update comes on the first anniversary of expanded transit service connecting communities along highway where RCMP say 18 women have disappeared or have been murdered.
A news release from the Ministry of Transportation says approximately 5,000 people have used the expanded transit service over the last year.
That service connects Prince George to Burns Lake, Smithers, the Hazelton area and Terrace, a distance of nearly 600 kilometres.
The ministry says more than 9,000 passengers have also used the new community-vehicle program since the summer.
That includes 7,000 passengers, or 43 people every day who rely on the 18-kilometre shuttle service between Vanderhoof and the Saik'uz community.
“People in northern B.C., in particular, women and teenaged girls, are benefiting from these new transportation services, knowing there is a safe link to get between communities,” Transportation Minister Claire Trevena says in the release.
Reg Mueller, Deputy Tribal Chief with the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, says the community-vehicle program provides valuable access to employment and education opportunities.
Vanderhoof Mayor Gerry Thiessen says it has “changed our communities for the better.”
Transit across northern B.C. was a key issue raised repeatedly during last fall's hearings in Smithers by the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.
Gladys Radek, whose 22-year-old niece Tamara Lynn Chipman disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert in 2005, told the inquiry they know people who have to hitchhike just to go to work and called for a free shuttle bus service.
The subsidized Highway 16 transit service has prompted Greyhound Canada to ask for provincial regulatory approval to cancel its route from Prince George to Prince Rupert.
When the application was submitted last summer, Greyhound said the subsidized routes had “literally put us out of business” along the corridor.
The Passenger Transportation Board is due to rule soon on Greyhound's application.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A Grand Rapids man will face decades in prison after a jury found them guilty of several charges linked to the reproduction and distribution of child pornography.
The Kent County Prosecutor's Office says David Roop, 61, was convicted Wednesday of all five criminal charges they faced: child sexually abusive activity, two counts of using a computer to commit a crime, distributing child sexually abusive material and possession of child sexually abusive material.
The child sexually abusive activity charge is a 20-year felony, as is one of the counts of using a computer to commit a crime. The distribution and second computer charges are seven-year felonies, and the possession charge is a four-year felony.
Roop was arrested in September 2016 after the Michigan State Police Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force searched their home and found child porn.
Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 9.

Hotstar remains India's most popular OTT video streaming platform, according to data from mobile advertising and Internet service provider Jana. Hotstar is controlled by 21st Century Fox and operates on the freemium model, offering VoD users some content free of charge, and some paid for by annual subscription.
Jana's report uses app installations as its yardstick. It shows that in the first quarter of 2018, Hotstar enjoyed 70% of video streaming app downloads. SonyLIV doubled its share from 5.9% three months earlier, to 13%. Viacom 18's Voot was in third place with 11%, while Amazon Prime Video had a 5% share and Netflix 1.4%.
The nascent Indian OTT video market is currently valued at $109 million and is expected to double to $218 million by 2020, according to a recent Deloitte report.
U.S.-based Jana was launched in 2009 and has raised $93 million in investment. The company is a leading provider of free Internet in emerging markets, accessed through its mCent browser, one of the fastest growing browsers in India.
Its report also looks at the Indian music sector, valued at $180 million by Deloitte and set to grow to $270 million by 2020. Google Play Music remains by far the most downloaded service with an almost unchanged 64% of music app installations. In terms of time spent in-app by users, Google Play Music dropped from 46% to 40%, quarter-on-quarter, but remained 2% ahead of Jio-Saavn, a company newly formed by the merger of music streamers Saavn and Reliance Industries, JioMusic.
Alabama Democrats see Tuesday's special Senate election as a chance to renounce a history littered with politicians whose race-baiting, bombast and other baggage have long soiled the state's reputation beyond its borders.
Roy Moore
Many Republicans see the vote as chance to ratify their conservative values and protect President Donald Trump's agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
At the center are Republican Roy Moore, a former jurist twice removed as state chief justice and now accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago, and Democrat Doug Jones, an erstwhile federal prosecutor best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for killing four black girls in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
The winner will take the seat held previously by Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Republicans control the Senate with 52 seats.
And while Trump themselves didn't campaign in the state after Moore was hit with allegations of sexual misconduct, the president recorded an audio message for robocalls that went to voters on Monday — underscoring the importance to Trump's agenda of keeping the seat in Republican hands.
The matchup mixes both Alabama's tortured history and the nation's current divisive, bitterly partisan politics, and it has made a spectacle of a Deep South state well acquainted with national scrutiny but not accustomed to competitive general elections.
"This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for," Jones told supporters at one stop Sunday, adding that their campaign "is on the right side of history." At an earlier appearance, they declared Alabama is "at a crossroads" and that Moore, an unapologetic evangelical populist, tries only to "create conflict and division."
Jones, 63, stops short of explicitly comparing Moore to the four-term Gov. George Wallace, whose populism was rooted in segregation. But Jones alluded Sunday to that era of Alabama politics.
"Elect a responsible man to a responsible office," Jones said, repeating the campaign slogan of another Alabama governor, Albert Brewer, who nearly defeated Wallace in 1970 in a contest Alabama liberals and many moderates still lament as a lost opportunity.
Some of Jones' supporters put it even more bluntly. "I thought Alabama's image was pretty much at the bottom," said Pat Lawrence, a retired software engineer in Huntsville. A Moore win, Lawrence added, "will be a whole new bottom."
Those concerns extend even to some GOP quarters. Alabama's senior senator, Richard Shelby, confirmed Sunday that they did not vote for Moore, saying they wrote in another "distinguished" party figure they declined to name.
Yet for many Republicans, Moore is a paragon of traditional values. They reject accusations that they molested two teenage girls and pursued relationships with others decades ago. Moore denies the charges.
"Everyone has to vote their convictions," said Kevin Mims of Montgomery, as they held their Bible outside their Baptist church Sunday in Montgomery. "My conviction is he's the right man for the job."
Where Moore's critics see a state judge who defied federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Mims sees a stalwart who stands "on the word of God." Other conservatives see an anti-establishment firebrand in the mold of Trump, who won Alabama by 28 percentage points.
Moore encourages that view with fundraising emails that urge backers to help them "defeat the elite," a swipe at both Democrats and the establishment Republicans who tried to deny them the GOP nomination earlier this year.
Ultimately, Republicans from Moore to Trump themselves are betting on a simple bottom line: Most Alabama conservatives simply won't defect to a Democrat.
"If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold," Trump says in a robocall the Moore campaign plans to push out Monday.
The president also invokes a common fear among Republicans, calling Jones "a puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer," the Democratic House and Senate leaders in Washington, both of them reviled by conservative voters. "Roy Moore is the guy we need to pass our Make American Great Again agenda," the president insists.
Moore's baggage could make it difficult to draw conclusions about what the results might mean beyond Alabama, but both parties are watching closely.
Democrats need to flip 24 GOP-held seats to reclaim a House majority, and they're trying to dent the slim Republican advantage in the Senate and its dominance of statehouses around the country. In many of those races, they'll need the same thing Jones must get to win in Alabama: strong turnout among young and non-white voters, along with improved performance among suburban moderates.
A Jones victory would be hailed as a potential precursor, and Democrats have indicated they have a post-Alabama strategy even if Jones loses: They'll take Alabama's brand national, hammering Republicans as "the party of Donald Trump and Roy Moore."

New Delhi: Talismanic striker Sunil Chhetri today said a mid-match dressing down from coach Stephen Constantine got the best out of the Indian football team in its AFC Asian Cup 2019 qualifier against Kyrgyzstan.
Chhetri, who scored the solitary goal in India's win, said this was by far the team's best performance in more than a decade.
India's all-time highest scorer, Chhetri stamped their class yet again as they scored the match-winner to fire India to a 1-0 win in an entertaining match at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru last night.
"I'm part of the national team for more than 10 years. Trust me, I don't remember when did we play such a fantastic brand of football last time," they said.
The Chhetri-led side lacked panache in the first 45 minutes, but a "bashing" from Constantine set things in order after the break.
"We got a heavy bashing from the gaffer in the dressing room. Clearly, the situation wasn't an ideal one. That's why, when we came out for the next 45 minutes, it was a changed side, more focused and more promising."
Although their goal made the difference, they refused to take all the credit for netting the winners against Myanmar and Kyrgyz Republic.
"Last day it was Udanta, tonight it was Jeje — had they not made the scintillating run to feed me with the passes, those goals would haven't seen the daylight. It's not about me, it's about the team.
"My goal might be the cherry at the top but the credit goes to all. Right from Gurpreet, the tenacious defenders, midfielders, everyone fought to their limit to churn this result," they said.
Chhetri said there is nothing bigger than putting on the national team shirt.
"We don't need any extra motivation. We always come out of the dressing room with the same hunger. We have to keep improving ourselves to churn out positive results."
They went on to rate yesterday's goal as a crucial one and won't mind putting it "right up there".
They said, "Accumulating the importance of the goal, the timing and where it has come for the team — it'll surely be stacked up right there. I know I have said it more often but trust me, this goal has gotten us these three points. It's really huge for us."
Constantine said India deserved to win the game.
"More than anyone else, India deserved this. Not only the boys who played out there, everyone in the back office, the fans, and the staff played their part to get this result. I believe, the entire nation deserved this," the coach said.
Asked about the team's eight-match winning run, they quipped, "How about 9? I'm not a person who looks into the numbers too much. But 13 wins in 15 matches is really remarkable.
Be it at amateur level or intentional, producing this sort of result day in and day out is truly applaudable."
The Briton further added, "We have one foot in the AFC Asian Cup UAE 2019 now. We have to fight and get the results in the upcoming fixtures to get the job done."
A tense overnight standoff in Richmond has finally ended with RCMP taking one man into custody.
The Emergency Response Team was called in around midnight after officers were first called to the home near Cambie Road and Bargen Drive around 9 p.m.
The response team eventually moved in, using flash bangs to subdue the situation.
One man was arrested.
Richmond RCMP is not releasing many details at this time but is expected to release more this morning.

METAIRIE, La. -- Former New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers receiver Robert Meachem began serving a 30-day jail sentence Monday after failing to pay nearly $400,000 in alimony and child support, according to court records in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
Meachem, 32, can be released once $100,000 has been paid to their ex-wife, Andrea Rhodes. The couple divorced in 2014 and agreed to split custody of their two children.
The New Orleans Advocate reported that a judge ruled Meachem owed $588,000 and had paid only about $200,000. Meachem made more than $20 million in their eight-year career.
But according to the Advocate and NOLA.com, Meachem testified that they believed much of their money had been taken by a former officer of one of their charitable foundations and another assistant, since they didn't pay enough attention to their bank balances.
Meachem said they had to borrow money from former NFL associates to get by.
According to NOLA.com, an attorney for Meachem's ex-wife claimed in a previous hearing that Meachem secretly took millions out of their joint accounts. Meachem was also fined $500 for failing to produce an assistant in court to testify about their finances. A judge also denied Meachem's request for a new trial.
Meachem, a first-round draft choice out of Tennessee in 2007, played a key role as a deep threat on the Saints' 2009 Super Bowl championship team. They had 178 catches for 2,914 yards and 29 total touchdowns in their career -- plus one touchdown in the playoffs.
Meachem signed a lucrative long-term deal with the Chargers in 2012 that included $14 million in guaranteed money, but was released after one disappointing season and returned to the Saints in 2013. Meachem last played in 2014.

KARACHI - The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday sought reply from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) in a contempt of court application pertaining to unannounced loadshedding.
The CEO of K-Electric submitted their report before the court stating that due to some technical fault in Bin Qasim power plant, loadshedding was being carried out in some parts of the city. However, now situation is under-control and no prolonged loadshedding is being reported in anywhere in Karachi after the installation of parts which were imported recently from abroad.
Ayan Memon Advocate, counsel of the KE, argued before the court that the load management is being done in the city, and it has also been submitted to the Supreme Court.
The court, after hearing the KE report, has directed the petitioner to submit their reply in the next hearing on June 12.
Petitioner's counsel Faisal Siddiqui said that despite the judicial order, Nepra is avoiding taking action against K-Electric.
They added that the court had ordered Nepra to comply with its own instructions, but it failed to do so. They also denied the KE claims saying that an announced loadshedding is still going on in across the city.
Barrister Faisal Siddiqui said that KE is still unable to increase its production capacity and did not invest as per agreement.
The court has also asked the Nepra official to submit its report in the next hearing.
A contempt application was moved by Karamat Ali and others seeking compliance with court order. The petitioners submitted that hours-long unannounced loadshedding has troubled the citizens of Karachi.
Earlier, Barrister Faisal Siddiqui has pointed out that the Supreme Court in 2014 had directed the power utility not to resort to loadshedding in Ramazan and the KE was violating the apex court's order by still carrying out loadshedding as major parts of the city plunged into darkness during sehri timings, and the Nepra is avoiding to take any action against the power supply company. Barrister Siddiqui argued that the KE did not increase its production capacity as per the agreement.
The petitioners submitted that over 1,000 people lost their lives and over 40,000 people were affected by the heatwave in Karachi and other parts of the province in 2015. They sought enforcement of the fundamental rights and the law for the victims, the survivors and their families.
The petitioners pleaded the court to issue direction to the provincial and the federal government to provide compensations to the heatstroke victims, and declare the heatstroke patients were entitled, as a fundamental right under the Constitution, to demand an appropriate compensation from the government.
They added that the residents of the metropolis have fallen victim to unprecedented and sporadic power cuts as KE and the Sui Southern Gas Company engage in a war of words over a low supply of gas to the electricity provider which has impeded the provision of electricity to consumers.

Rawalpindi-Two armed dacoits shot dead a doctor during a dacoity bid in a clinic in broad daylight at Commercial Market, within limits of Police Station (PS) New Town, sources informed.
After committing the crime, the armed dacoits managed to escape the scene.
The deceased was identified as Dr Noshad Khalid, whose dead body was moved to District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital for autopsy.
According to sources, two unidentified dacoits walked into the clinic of Dr Noshad Khalid, situated near Nirala Sweets in Commercial Market and took the doctor hostage on gunpoint. Later, the dacoits snatched cash and mobile phone from the doctor and fired at them when they showed resistance. As a result, the doctor died on the spot while dacoits fled the crime scene, sources added.
Rescue 1122 shifted the dead body to the hospital. After receiving the news of the murder, City Police Officer (CPO) Afzaal Kausar and SSP (Operations) Muhammad Bin Ashraf rushed to the crime scene where SHO PS New Town Javed Iqbal Mirza and Homicide Investigation Unit (HIU) investigators were already busy collecting evidence.
A spokesperson to CPO told the media that police have collected evidence from the crime scene besides recording statements of eyewitnesses. They said that experts have also prepared sketches of the fleeing dacoits.
Meanwhile, a huge fire broke out in huts near a slaughter house within limits of PS Ratta Amral. The fire brigade rushed to the site and extinguished the fire. An official told media some 50 huts were reduced to ashes due to the fire. However, no loss of life or injury was reported.
HOUSTON—Former President George H.W. Bush has been hospitalized in Houston with an infection, just after attending the funeral of their wife, Barbara, a spokesperson said. Jim McGrath said Monday on Twitter that the 93-year-old Bush is “responding to treatments and appears to be recovering.” They were admitted Sunday morning to Houston Methodist Hospital after an infection spread to their blood, McGrath said. Barbara Bush was laid to rest Saturday in a ceremony attended by their husband and former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and their wives, along with current first lady Melania Trump. Mrs. Bush was 92, and they and their husband had been married 73 years — the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history. George H.W. Bush uses a wheelchair and an electric scooter for mobility after developing a form of Parkinson's disease, and they have needed hospital treatment several times in recent years for respiratory problems. They attended the funeral wearing a pair of knitted socks decorated in blue, red and yellow books — a tribute to their late wife's work promoting literacy.

McGrath wouldn't elaborate Monday night on the specifics of Bush's condition, saying additional updates would be issued “as events warrant.” But they said the 41st president was eager to get well so they can get to their summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. “He's the most goal-oriented person on this planet,” McGrath said. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush indicated during their eulogy Saturday that their father had been hospitalized recently at the same time Barbara Bush was in the hospital for the last time. Those hospitalizations were not publicly disclosed at the time.
“I think Dad got sick on purpose so that they could be with her,” Jeb Bush said. First lady Melania Trump tweeted Monday evening that they were sending “healing thoughts of strength, along with prayers, for President George HW Bush tonight.” On Friday, during the public viewing of Barbara Bush's casket, George H.W. Bush offered their hand to many of the around 2,500 people who walked through the church to pay their respects. A year ago this month, they spent two weeks in the hospital for treatment of pneumonia and chronic bronchitis, a constant irritation of the lining of tubes that carry air to one's lungs. Their doctors said chronic bronchitis is a condition more prevalent with age and can aggravate the symptoms of pneumonia. The elder Bush was hospitalized for 16 days in January 2017 for pneumonia. During that hospital stay, which included time in intensive care, doctors inserted a breathing tube and connected them to a ventilator. They also are hospitalized in 2015 in Maine after falling at home and breaking a bone in their neck, and in December 2014 for about a week for shortness of breath. They spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. People in their 90s with Parkinson's disease are often at higher risk of pneumonia and other infections because their swallowing process can be compromised, said Dr. David Reuben, professor of geriatric medicine at the UCLA medical school in Los Angeles. “And the stress of losing a loved one can weaken the immune system,” they said. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, they said, while viral infections require other treatments. Infections that spread to the blood usually are not viral, however, they said. The prognosis for such a case would depend on a number of factors, including heart rate, blood pressure and oxygenation, Reuben said. “The more of these parameters are abnormal, the more serious the case is,” they said. George Herbert Walker Bush served as president from 1989 to 1993. Born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Mass., Bush also served as a member of congress, CIA director and Ronald Reagan's vice-president.

Congress' decision to move an impeachment notice against CJI Dipak Misra was wrong which is why the Trinamool Congress did not support it, said TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday during an interview with News18 Bangla."The Congress wanted us to support it. But we did not. I told Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi not to go for the impeachment," Banerjee said, adding that their party did not want to interfere in the judiciary.The impeachment notice moved by Congress had the support of 64 MPs and seven opposition parties. However, Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday rejected the notice saying the allegations were neither "tenable nor admissible".The opposition parties had alleged “misbehaviour” on part of the CJI on five different counts during their tenure.Speaking on a host of other issues, Banerjee also predicted a defeat for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 elections.She said, “It looks difficult for the BJP to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Both the moves of GST and demonetisation went against the party. The party has indulged in politics of division while fuel prices continue to rise steadily. Even the money people put in the banks is not secure.”Mamata Banerjee also took a potshot at the BJP and Congress over their move to approach the court over the panchayat election violence saying people are ready to vote for the Trinamool Congress which the opposition parties know. “They know that they are going to lose the elections, which is why they are running to the courts. We will win the elections with a huge margin,” Banerjee told News18 Bangla.Speaking on the 'Third Front', the Trinamool Congress chief said they will definitely form the 'Third Front' and if Congress becomes a part of it, they won't object to it. Banerjee said, "The Front will work towards a common goal. Whoever wants to support it is welcome to join, which includes the Congress."The West Bengal CM also attacked the BJP government at the Centre saying fearing the 'Third Front', the party is attacking the TMC government in West Bengal and spreading rumours about law and order problem in the state.
Peter Thiel has some wild ideas, but transfusing teen blood into their own body might not be their bag.
Stories of countesses bathing in virgin blood, or vampiric nobles sucking the juice out of the young, have captured our attention for centuries. But when stories started coming out that tech billionaire Peter Thiel was interested in transfusing teen blood into their own body, it sent Silicon Valley into a fever dream. Peter Thiel, the vampire!
Thiel has been alleged to have a lot of crazy ideas — like that women shouldn't have been given the vote or that we should create lawless floating nations to solve society's problems. The coup de grâce appeared to be Thiel's role in toppling Gawker ten years after the media company wrote openly about their sexuality.
Then, of course, they joined Trump, a pariah in the tech world. No wonder everyone was quick to believe that Thiel would be willing to suck the blood of the young if it added a few more years to their own life.
Jeff Bercovici of Inc. first wrote that Thiel was so afraid of dying that they were looking at “having younger people's blood transfused into their own veins.” Toward that end, the story reported, a Thiel Capital medical director had even contacted a startup called Ambrosia that was harvesting the blood of teens, hoping to invest.
In short order, Vanity Fair, Gawker, and numerous other media sites repeated the story. Ambrosia received so much press attention that founder Jesse Karmazin was even invited to talk about their work at Recode's recent Code Conference. Meanwhile, an episode of HBO's “Silicon Valley” poked fun at the unsettling idea.
But the story that Thiel was looking to harvest the blood of the young simply isn't true, according to Karmazin, who says they were never contacted by Thiel or anyone associated with Thiel Capital. “I wish I did know Peter Thiel,” they said. “He's not even a patient. If they were, I would have to say ‘We can't disclose that information.' But he's not even a patient so I can tell you, he's not a patient'.”
Unquestionably, Thiel has been interested in cheating death for several years. They told Business Insider back in 2012, “Death is a problem that can be solved.” He's also investing in life extension research, funding Cynthia Kenyon, Aubrey de Grey and a number of other researchers who are focused on anti-aging. Last fall, the life extension startup Unity Biotechnology also raised an enormous round of funding from Thiel and other Silicon Valley billionaires interested in the prospect of humans living much longer lives.
Ambrosia — which takes donated teen blood and pumps it into anyone age 35 or older for $8,000 a pop — seems like just the type of wild startup that would interest Thiel.
As questionable as the idea sounds, blood from the young is not new. The process, known as parabiosis, has at least been successful in mice. Karmazin also says he's seen their own patients' hair return from gray back to its original color, and they say they have noted a remarkable difference in pep in the 600 or so people now going through treatment in their facility.
Contrary to the depiction in “Silicon Valley,” however, Ambrosia cannot directly hire the teens. Due to fairly strict regulations, people can't be compensated for their blood, so the startup relies heavily instead on donor facilities.
It's also a very experimental procedure for humans at this point, with repeated sessions needed to keep up the effects, Karmazin says. (“You don't look like you are 20 after one treatment,” they tell me.)
That's saying nothing of the fact that the process can be duplicated. Anyone with a certain medical understanding could set up their own shop and charge people for the same service. Asked about the challenge, Karmazin says Ambrosia is by design “not structured as a money-making operation.”
The risks associated with blood transfusions also sound pretty risky and the pay-to-play aspect of Ambrosia has drawn criticism in the science world. Others have called into question the idea of filling old people's veins with teen blood as an anti-aging solution.
Still, Karmazin is hopeful he'll have some good results from a preliminary human trial in the next year. As for the media frenzy, Karmazin says the old adage that there's no such thing as bad press is true, and that all the wild stories have led to a lot of inquiry.
“It's amazing how many journalists just repeat what they've read,” they say.

Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie has arrived on Capitol Hill, where they are talking to House Democrats about their time with the data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's campaign.
Wylie's visit is part of a Democratic attempt to keep congressional focus on Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether Trump's campaign was involved.  They are talking to Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday and Democrats on the House intelligence committee Wednesday.
The GOP-led House intelligence panel shut down its Russian meddling probe last month, saying they don't see any evidence of collusion or coordination.
Wylie sparked a global debate over electronic privacy in March when they were part of an effort to reveal that Cambridge Analytica had gathered millions of Facebook profiles to influence elections.
A volunteer firefighter in southeast Iowa is accused of arson.
According to the Poweshiek County Sheriff's Office, 20-year-old Chance Beres was arrested in connection with a structure fire in a rural part of the county Sunday night. The structure was destroyed and investigators say Beres is also a suspect in connection with a number of fires that have occurred in the county over the last five months. He's currently charged with second-degree arson.
The Des Moines Register reports that Beres is an EMT with Midwest Ambulance in Grinnell and was also a probationary member with the Montezuma Volunteer Fire Department and EMS since April 18.

Italian Team Of Daniel Mancinelli/Niccolo Schiro Capture Sprintx Round 8 Sunday
Posted by: newsla on Aug 14, 2017 - 06:43 AM Italian Team Of Daniel Mancinelli/Niccolo Schiro Capture Sprintx Round 8 Sunday In Exciting Finish At Utah Motorsports Campus
The Italian team of Daniel Mancinelli and Niccolo Schiro took the checkered flag Sunday at Utah Motorsports Campus in a trophy dash finish at the Pirelli World Challenge Round 8 SprintX 60-minute feature as part of the Security National Mortgage Supercar Grand Prix of Utah.
Driving the No. 31 TR3 Racing/The Collection/Italian Shoemaker Ferrari 488 GT3, Schiro jumped to the lead from the pole Sunday and paced the 31-car field in the first 11 laps around the 3.048-mile, 14-turn road circuit. On 12th lap, Schiro pitted with a 4.3-second lead and handed the Ferrari off to Mancinelli, the VIR SprintX race winner.
A late race full-course caution period left Mancinelli in the lead of the event with Ryan Eversley, Patrick Long, Michael Cooper, Alvaro Parente, Ricky Taylor, Bryan Sellers and Ryan Dalziel all set to make for a three-lap dash to the finish of the one-hour competition.
In the end, Mancinelli fought off Eversley in turn one at the restart of lap 24 and went on to score a 0.969-second win over the No. 43 RealTime Racing Acura of Eversley from Atlanta and Tom Dyer of Corte Madera, Calif. The victory for the No. 31 Ferrari was the second in SprintX action this year and Mancinelli is the first driver to repeat in SprintX this year. Daniel teamed with Andrea Montermini to capture the VIRginia International Raceway Round 1 last April.
We had a strategy to pit early and this was a great choice by the team because it ended up working out well for us, said Mancinelli. There was quite a lot of traffic in front of Niccolo so they decided to pull the car inside early when the pit window opened. We were the first car into the pits, and then I was able to come back into a clear track and push hard for two laps. At the second caution, the Acura was on my exhaust and they tried to pass because they were so good in the straights but I closed the door. They tried to get on the inside and I went outside, then the next corner they were right next to me but left me proper racing room. From there, I put in two laps that were fast like qualifying laps and that allowed me to take the victory for the team who gave me the car in perfect condition. This circuit is fun because it's wider than others and you're able to go two-to-three cars side-by-side and that makes it fun and exciting for the viewers.
We knew that the Acura (NSX) was very fast on the straight, said Schiro, It was very important for us to keep the first position at the first corner. We knew we had a really good pace and that we could manage it, so my race went as planned. When we handed it over to Daniel (Mancinelli) we were a little nervous because of all the cautions and re-starts. It wasn't easy. Congratulations to everybody. Thanks to the guys at TR3 Racing for this opportunity for me to race in America.
Eversley and Dyer were pleased with the performance of their No. 32 RealTime Racing Acura NSX GT3 Sunday despite taking runner-up.
One of the things I'm really proud of is the development of this Acura across the board, said Eversley. Everybody at HPD putting in countless hours; Mike Shank Racing and, obviously, RealTime Racing have collaborated so well. Actually, there are about five teams that collaborate on this program around the country, and it's a really great program. But today we executed perfectly. I don't think we really had anything for the Ferrari, especially once they got going. At least the car is in one piece, we got great points, took fifth yesterday and second place today.
It was a definite improvement from yesterday, said Dyer. We made some adjustments overnight and they worked as well as we hoped. We got a good start, had a nice little battle back and forth with my teammate (Mark Wilkins) but it was great. Racing with Mark is always awesome. It's clean and we race each other hard, but always keep it clean. Maybe if we had a little less yellow (flags), we could have fought the yellow car (Schiro/Mancinelli) a little harder but that's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.
Third went to CTMP winners Cooper of Syosset, N.Y., and Jordan Taylor of Orlando, Fla., in the No. 8 Cadillac Racing Cadillac ATS-V.R. followed by reigning PWC GT champion Parente and 20-year-old Ben Barnicoat of England in the No. 9 K-PAX Racing McLaren 650S; Ricky Taylor of Apopka, Fla., and four-time PWC GT champion Johnny OConnell of Flowery Branch, Ga., in the No. 3 Cadillac Racing Cadillac ATS-V.R. and Long of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and Jorg Bergmeister of Germany in the No. 58 Wright Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3 R.
It was exciting at the end, Cooper said. I was way up on the wheel and in attack mode. We just cant keep losing points to these guys. I think we extended our SprintX points lead today. Jordan did a good job all weekend. The restarts really helped us to make-up track position and allowed me to put the No. 58 Porsche behind me in the last two laps.
My stint wasnt the most exciting, Jordan Taylor said. I got out dragged at the start. We were starting behind some of the Pro/Am cars with the Pro drivers in them. They were taking some risks, so it didnt make sense to battle them. Once we got through the first lap, I kind of settled in. Michael did a great job on the restarts to get us on the podium. It was a great weekend for SprintX points for Michael and myself and for Cadillac.
Saturdays SprintX winning team of Peter Kox of The Netherlands and Mark Wilkins of Toronto, Ont., Can., was forced to pit the No. 93 RealTime Racing Acura NSX GT3 on lap three with a punctured tire while running second Sunday in the 26-lap main event.
In the Pro/Am category, GTA point leader James Sofronas of Villa Park, Calif., and Mathieu Jaminet of France in the No. 14 GMG Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3 R scored the victory. Finishing out the Pro/Am podium was Ricardo Sanchez of Mexico and former GTA champion Frankie Montecalvo of Highlands, N.J., in the No. 75 Always Evolving/AIM Autosport Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3 and Tim Pappas of Boston, Mass., and Jeroen Bleekemolen of Monaco in the No. 54 Black Swan Racing Mercedes-AMG GT3.
Additional class winners in the SprintX division Sunday at Utah Motorsports Campus were Henrique Cisneros and Jonathon Ziegelman in the No. 30 MOMO/NGT Motorsports Ferrari 458 GT3 in Am/Am; Alessandro Bressan and Yuki Harata in the No. 55 Dream Racing Motorsports Lamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo in GT Cup Pro/Am; Joe Toussaint and Cory Friedman in the No. 90 Autometrics Porsche 911 GT3 Cup in GT Cup Am/Am; Adam Merzon and Trent Hindman in the No. 017 Case-It Racing Porsche Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR in GTS Pro/Am; and Jason Hart and Matt Travis in the No. 47 NOLAsport Porsche Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR in the GTS Am/Am.
Sundays Round 8 SprintX event well be televised on Sunday, August 20, at 4:00 EDT on CBS Sports Network.
The next SprintX round (4  CTMP make-up race, 9 and 10) will be contested at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, on Sept. 1-3 for the final SprintX competition of the 2017 Pirelli World Challenge.

PaddockTalk Perspective
Ten years ago today, Rich Hill started a postseason game for the first time. They had just completed the first, and still the only, full season of their major league career. They surrendered a leadoff home run and allowed three runs in three innings, ultimately responsible for the Chicago Cubs' season-ending loss at Wrigley Field.
Tomorrow at Dodger Stadium, the 37-year-old left-hander will make their fifth postseason start, and they will do so with an altered perspective.
“The 25, 26, 27-year-old me would be more result-oriented,” Hill said. “Instead of process-oriented, moment-oriented, understanding that really it comes down to having the ball come out of your hand as many times as you want it to.
“When you can do that in any type of situation on this highest level, you're going to have more success than failure.”
Since their improbable revival at age 35, Hill has become famous for their focus and antics on the days they start. It is a continued source of enjoyment for their teammates, who appreciate the intensity they bring and the intention they stress.
“You guys just had Rich,” grinning Manager Dave Roberts told the assembled media in the Dodger Stadium press conference room Friday. “He's crazy.”
The Dodgers also appreciate their pitching. After a dominant six-start run after their Aug. 1 acquisition, Hill produced six scoreless innings in last year's National League Championship Series. Over 25 starts this season, they owned a 3.32 earned-run average.
Their September ERA was even better: 1.86.
LAHORE - The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) submitted comprehensive "Taxation Proposals" for the upcoming Punjab Budget 2017-18 representing the collective recommendations of foreign investors.
OICCI proposals are focused on accelerating economic growth and FDI inflow in the province and the country. Commenting on the OICCI Punjab Province Taxation Proposals, OICCI President Khalid Mansoor said, "OICCI Members commend the initiative being taken by the Punjab government and Punjab Revenue Authority in broadening the reach of its coverage to 45,000 registered taxpayers already and its active engagement in building a conducive private-public partnership among the key stakeholders”.
“It is desirable that the Punjab government give a serious consideration to our taxation proposals which eventually will be a win-win for the province, the country and the tax payers,” they added.
The OICCI's specific recommendations for inclusion in Punjab Budget 2017-18 include, Punjab sales tax rates which is 16 percent on services should be reduced in 2017 budget at parity with Sindh sales tax rate of 13 percent and gradually reduced to 10 percent over the next three years, Agricultural Income should be taxed on actual, and not notional income, including rent income of absentee landlords. Telephone usage sales tax rate of 19.5 percent, should be made equivalent to GST rate on services, Input Adjustment on Franchise Fee should be allowed to manufacturers, and this is also allowed in other provinces, Input Tax paid by pharmaceutical industry and export of services by registered persons should be zero rated.
The OICCI Taxation Proposals for Punjab also include recommendations for a better co-ordination between all Sales Tax authorities in Punjab, Sindh, KPK and Balochistan and with FBR, a uniform definition of taxation of services and jurisdiction be agreed to facilitate the tax payers, and input of sales tax should be allowed as whole and not for the assets exclusively used in a province. Furthermore, the federal and provincial governments should urgently address the issue of jurisdiction of WWF/WPPF and provide clarity to tax payers.
The OICCI is the collective voice of nearly 200 members, representing nearly all the largest foreign investors in Pakistan, who contribute, annually, over one third of the revenue collections in the country by the federal and provincial revenue authorities and invest over $1.5 billion annually in new capital expenditure. OICCI is the largest chamber in terms of economic contribution and CSR initiatives by its members, which benefits over 20 million underprivileged sections of society.
Iraq has announced the start of a massive operation in the western province of Anbar aimed at clearing the desert area of Daesh terrorists.
The US-backed offensive comes less than two months after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared that Daesh had been routed in the country.
"The operation aims at destroying hideouts of Daesh in the Anbar desert along the Iraqi-Saudi border," chief of the Anbar Operations Major General Mahmoud al-Falahi said.
Government forces and tribal fighters supported by a US-led air alliance are participating in the operation, they added in a press statement.
Daesh terrorists seized large swathes of Iraqi territory in a 2014 blitz and has since claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks there.
“I have come to believe that affordable housing efforts need to always be inclusive of artists, but should never be exclusive to them. By not connecting these still too-often siloed conversations, we are doing a disservice to both artists and the housing sector itself. “
Thousands of fans, eight games, four teams, and one grand prize.
While the Regina Pats weren't able to come away with the Memorial Cup, organizers are calling the event a success.

49,091 people attended the round-robin games from May 18-27. Since the Brandt Centre holds 6,484 spectators, that works out to 94 per cent of tickets sold, including three sellouts.
While the 100th edition of the Memorial Cup opened to a lackluster crowd of 5,678 people, a strong performance by the hometown Pats and rival Swift Current Broncos boosted numbers as the week went on. Host Committee Chair Shaun Semple said numbers were on par with expectations and they predicted lower attendance for games happening over the long weekend.

Attendance does not include those who watched Sunday's sold-out final between the Pats and champion Acadie-Bathurst Titan on screens outside the Brandt Centre, and thousands who took in concerts and other Memorial Cup-related events throughout the week.
Hundreds visited an on-site celebration zone that hosted a Hockey Hall of Fame exhibit, family-friendly activities, and even the Stanley Cup.
Another 27,000 people braved a rainstorm to take in the opening ceremonies and Eagles concert which Semple said is a record for tournament kickoff.
Despite strong numbers, the host committee said it will lose $2 million between the two main events, besides paying $3.65 million to host.
All-in-all, it was an average performance considering past numbers at the tournament. The 2013 Memorial Cup in Saskatoon still claims the best game attendance over the last ten years, with 82,503 people packing the SaskTel Centre.
With an average of 6,136 fans per game, Regina ranked 5th in attendance, and 4th in percentage of tickets sold compared to other hosts going back to 2008.
Some hosts, like Red Deer and Brandon, were able to add additional seating to their rinks and boost sales. Semple said the Pats looked into adding more space, but it wasn't feasible in the Brandt Centre.

Amid fresh debate regarding Section 377 of the IPC, two 20-year-old women from Uttar Pradesh tricked their families and got married at a mass wedding.One of the women pretended to be the groom and filed papers for marriage with the organisers of the mass wedding, a common practice in UP.According to a report in Hindustan Times, the two had known each other for about two years. Their parents had no idea that they were in love and planned to marry.On April 16, the two women showed up to the mass wedding, replete with ID cards and two sets of fake parents. The woman who posed as the ‘groom' even procured an Aadhaar card in the name of ‘Kartik Shukla'.It was only on Saturday that the bride's parents discovered that the ‘groom' was actually another woman. Both had been staying at the bride's house.The ‘groom' was allegedly spotted by their neighbours, who informed the bride's parents after the women posted their wedding pictures on social media. The family immediately called the two women and allegedly ‘attacked' the ‘groom' inside their house. In fact, the ensuing tussle ended with the ‘bride' jumping from the roof to ‘save' Rupa, Times of India reported.Local police had to come and settle the issue with the parents of the bride alleging cheating by the ‘groom'. However, police said they had to let the two women go as neither of the two women's' families had filed a complaint against either. The two women are both consenting adults and thus cannot be forced to stay separately if they don't want to.Since 2013, homosexuality is a criminal offence under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalises ‘unnatural sex against the order of nature' and gives authorities the right to prosecute on the basis of sexual orientation or preference.But while Section 377 criminalises the act of sexual intercourse between same-sex individuals, it does not lay down any specifics regarding same-sex union or marriage. It leaves a grey area for same-sex couples to get married under various religious customs, though it has no legal recognition by the government of India, same-sex relations face widespread taboo and discrimination that often result on violence against the ‘perpetrators'.The debate around section 377 was reopened in 2017 after the landmark judgment by a Supreme Court bench declaring ‘right to privacy' as a fundamental right. Some argued that Section 377 was directly at odds with ‘right to privacy', which had now been declared a fundamental right, and thus Section 377 was impinging upon the rights of the LGBT community.On Monday, a Supreme Court bench sent a notice to the Centre demanding a response on a PIL that seeks to decriminalise Section 377. The Centre is expected to respond within a week.
Ranbir Kapoor says he's never faced a casting couch situation, calls it 'worst thing, if there is'
Ranbir Kapoor says they have never faced the casting couch. The actor commented when they were asked for their opinion on veteran choreographer Saroj Khan's controversial statement that casting couch "provides livelihood at least" in the film industry.
"I have never faced it (casting couch). If it's there, it is the worst thing," Ranbir said at the teaser launch of their upcoming film Sanju on 24 April.
Speaking to media, Khan had said, "Can I tell you one thing? This has been going on since the beginning of time. It hasn't started now. Someone or the other tries to take advantage of every other girl. Even the government (sic) does it. Then why are you after the film industry? It provides livelihood at least. Noone rapes and leaves you. It depends on the girl, what they want to do. If you don't want to fall into the wrong hands, you won't. If you have art, why will you sell yourself? Don't take the film industry's name, it is everything for us."
Soon the word spread and they received a lot of flak for their statement. However, soon after, the veteran choreographer issued an apology.

What's The Grind Line? Apart from the once-famous line of Kris Draper, Kirk Maltby, and either Joe Kocur or Darren McCarty, The Grind Line is also The Hockey Writers' weekly column about the Detroit Red Wings. Jacob Messing, Griffin Schroeder, and Tony Wolak are the muckers who make up THW's forechecking unit and sound off on Red Wings topics.
Whether general manager Ken Holland returns to the team or not, the Detroit Red Wings have a lot on their offseason checklist with a bulk of draft picks, handful of free agents to re-sign and a few trades likely in the works.
Right now, the organization looks like an all-you-can-eat buffet on one plate. Dylan Larkin, Anthony Mantha, Andreas Athanasiou, Tyler Bertuzzi and Martin Frk are all restricted free agents (RFA) this summer. Mike Green, who is rumored to come back, is a pending unrestricted free agent.
With little cap space, there are a lot of questions to be answered. It likely means Holland will look to move other contracts to fit in the youth, but with a plethora of no-trade clauses, it's easier said than done. Who could be on the outside looking in?
Related – The Grind Line: Red Wings Next Big Move
Jacob Messing: Martin Frk
A second-round pick in 2012, Frk took the long way to the NHL as they bounced between the ECHL and American Hockey League (AHL). The 24-year-old earned a spot out of camp in Andreas Athanasiou's absence and has been in the lineup with moderate regularity this season, as they own 11 goals and 22 points through 58 games.
A wicked, yet inaccurate, shot has helped them net five power-play goals, but a lack of defensive awareness (minus-13) and rough skating has kept them in a reserved, fourth-line role. It's relatively easy to see them as a slightly more effective Teemu Pulkkinen.
The major difference is Frk's 6-foot-1 frame and overall greater willingness to use their body and not shy away from contact. Pulkkinen, an elite AHL producer, yet poor NHL contributor, was claimed by Minnesota off waivers, later traded to Arizona and then taken by Vegas in the expansion draft. Teams were still interested in what they had to offer.
Frk offers more and at the young age of 24. He's been able to back up their booming, right-handed shot with other qualities. As a pending RFA, they could be moved for future considerations or a mid-to-late round draft pick. Cutting down the list of RFAs would go a long way this summer.
Another team would be willing to take a chance on them at a price they get to negotiate and with prospects knocking on the door, the extra cap space (albeit little) and roster spot could go to better use.

Tony Wolak: Trevor Daley
If Holland or another general manager decides to accelerate the rebuild this summer with a few more trades, Trevor Daley could net the Red Wings a nice return. While the defense was probably Detroit's weakest point this season, Daley was the best blue-liner and has a coveted skill set.
The veteran defenseman likes to join the rush, plays the right side, and doesn't try to be too fancy exiting their own zone. Daley's nine goals—eight of which at even-strength—ranks first on the Red Wings and tied for 24th in the NHL – one more than Ottawa's Erik Karlsson in as many games.
With a cap hit of only $3,166,667, Daley's contract is the most palatable among Detroit's veteran defenders. He's inked through the next two seasons and, with the upper cap limit expected to rise over the next couple of years, should be playing to their percentage-of-salary-cap contract value through its expiration. Unless other trades are made, Detroit would also have the ability to retain salary of Daley was dealt. In return, the Red Wings could expect a third-round draft choice, possibly with some games played and team performance conditions.
Daley does provide value on and off the ice for the young Red Wings. Considering Henrik Zetterberg's recent comments about their uninspired, “poke-and-hope” efforts, having the veteran defenseman around to guide the likes of Dennis Cholowski, Joe Hicketts, Filip Hronek, and other prospects may be in Detroit's best interest. However, blueliners would need to be moved to allow those up-and-coming players adequate ice time and Daley is the most appetizing for trade partners.
Griffin Schroeder: Nick Jensen
With a restructuring of the defense core on the horizon, Jensen doesn't seem like he's a candidate to stick around for the long haul. At 27 years old, their ceiling as an NHL player is more or less known and they don't bring anything different from the rest of the Wings' blue line brigade.
However, this doesn't make them necessarily useless to the rest of the league.
As the tired cliché goes, there is no such thing as having too much depth on the blue line. The St. Paul native fits the bottom-pairing role to a tee and routinely rotates in Detroit's top-four by default due to the Wings' lack of riches in terms of rear guards. This indirectly has allowed them to showcase for a depth role on an interested squad.
They only have 13 points this season (all assists), but has been able to stay on the positive side puck possession-wise. They actually lead the team in Corsi-against-per-60 minutes (51.23%) and is second to Niklas Kronwall in even-strength shot suppression (29.25 shots-against-per-60).
The former fifth-round pick can also charge up the ice with the puck and has made that fact evident in recent weeks starting rushes all by himself. With the league getting faster, the bottom-pairing defenseman has shifted from the traditional bruiser to a skater that can move the puck and extend the team's attack. In this, Jensen provides value.
Related: Red Wings Nick Jensen Deserves to Stay
 They are not the strongest weighing in at 6'0” and 194 pounds, which can lead to them getting out-muscled behind the net by fore-checkers. However, they will likely have more help and structure on a contender that could plug them in against weaker competition.
The Wings simply will not have much use for Jensen now that Cholowski, Hicketts, Hronek, Vili Saarijarvi and another potentially promising defensive prospect from this year's draft are gunning for the roster in the coming years.
With another year of control on an ultra-friendly $812,500 deal, the Wings should shop around and see what they can get for their homegrown defender as an under-the-radar trade chip.

What a great day Sunday turned out to be for the BMW Dallas Marathon. And what an amazing finish in the women's division.
Chandler Self was far ahead of the field and heading toward the tape when their body just gave out. Struggling even to stand, Self began to collapse.
That's when a 17-year-old student from Greenhill Academy named Ariana Luterman jumped in to help Self across the finish line. Luterman was part of a relay team, and told reporters later “I just couldn't help but think that they worked so many months.”
This summer marks the 20th Anniversary of Lethal Weapon 4, and over those two decades, fans have been clamoring for Lethal Weapon 5. Over the years there has been plenty of talk of this sequel, most recently in December. Director Richard Donner revealed that the long-awaited sequel may actually happen, stating that they came up with a story alongside Lethal Weapon 4 writer Channing Gibson, and that both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were on board, stating that if everybody "steps up," it will happen. Now it seems that it may not happen, thanks to the Warner Bros. legal department. Here's what the director had to say during a recent podcast appearance.
"And I'm ready to do 5. It's called Lethal Finale. It's very dark. And we were all set to go and now Warner Bros. is doing their old-fashioned tricks. Not Warner Bros., there's this guy who runs the studio who's great but they have these people in the legal department who do the negotiating in the most counter-productive way. They should be sent to a studio and work with the producers and directors and actors, and learn what makes a film, and then negotiate. But it's just embarrassing."
Back in May 2016, original Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black revealed that they had crafted a massive 62-page treatment for Lethal Weapon 5, which would have centered on Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Mutaugh (Danny Glover) trying to fight a team of expert Blackwater military contractors who are smuggling antiques, all during the worst blizzard in New York City history. Given that Shane Black had once "specialized" in making off-beat Christmas movies, it was believed that this Lethal Weapon sequel would have taken place during the holiday season, although that was never confirmed.
There was also a report from 2014 that claimed Chris Hemsworth was set to star in a Lethal Weapon project that was said to be a hybrid of a sequel and a remake, with Chris Hemsworth believed to be playing Mel Gibson's son, who was about to enter the police academy. The story would have centered on that character, with Mel Gibson's Riggs believed to have just a cameo. Still, that project never moved forward, and now all these years later, it remains to be seen if the sequel will ever happen.
If Lethal Weapon 5 ever does happen, it will be the first directorial effort for Richard Donner in over a decade. The last film they directed was in 2006, the Bruce Willis action-thriller 16 Blocks, and there is no indication that the filmmaker has anything else in the works at this time. You can listen to director Richard Donner's full 76-minute interview on the Maltin on Movies Podcast.

SOUTH FORT MYERS, Fla. A fire that injured three people and ravaged a home Sunday on Ranchette Road has been ruled accidental, the South Trail Fire & Rescue District said.
An estimated $500,000 in damage to the home took place, according to the district. The blaze began in the attic and was electrical in nature.
Only a small portion of the house, which stood on the 14000 block of Ranchette Road, remains intact. The rest is just charred framing.
Two firefighters and one other person sustained non life-threatening injuries, district assistant chief Ben Bengston said. The other person was hospitalized but has since been released, according to the family that lives in the house.
They were trying to rescue the family's pets when they were hurt, the family said. They saved a kitten, but a puppy died in the fire.
The family's church and the American Red Cross are assisting.
The district, the state fire marshal's office and the Lee County Arson Task Force jointly conducted the investigation.
Feuding Gulf States that have pumped millions of dollars into public diplomacy appear to have done better in damaging the reputations of their detractors than in polishing their own tarnished images.
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia all appear to fare poorly in how they are perceived, judged by a recent survey of American public opinion.
The international community's response to the two-month-old Gulf crisis suggests, however, that Qatar so far has been more successful in garnering muted support for its call for direct talks to solve the crisis – a position rejected by its detractors.
Public perception
In the only survey to date of public perceptions in the United States of the Gulf crisis by Britain's YouGov on behalf of Saudi Arabia's foremost English-language daily, Arab News, Qatar faired poorest in its approval rating.
However, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the instigators of a diplomatic and economic boycott of the idiosyncratic Gulf state did not do much better.
Poll results showed that a mere 27% of the 2,263 people queried considered Qatar a friend or ally of the United States compared to Saudi Arabia with 37% and the UAE with 39%. Thirty-one percent identified Qatar as unfriendly or an enemy of the United States.
Only 16% of those polled associated Qatar with its hosting rights for the 2022 World Cup, while 34% linked Qatar to being accused of supporting terrorism. Forty-four percent believed that Qatar's state-owned Al Jazeera TV network provided a platform for militant and jihadist groups.
Arab News reported extensively on the poll, but appeared to refrain from providing a link to the original survey report. The report was also not immediately accessible on YouGov's website.
As a result, it was difficult to independently evaluate the survey beyond the results published by Arab News as well as based on the questions asked. It was also not clear to what degree the poll further surveyed perceptions of Qatar's detractors and how they compared to those of the Gulf state.
Public relations war
The Arab News reporting was the latest salvo in a public relations war waged by state-owned or privately-owned media on both sides of the Gulf divide that operate in an environment of highly restricted freedom of the press and often have close ties to government and/or ruling families.
The Financial Times quoted Saudi journalists as saying they had been pressured by government to criticize Qatar.
One Saudi editor described to the FT how officials have been using a mobile phone messaging group to instruct journalists on how to shape coverage and what stories to focus on. “These are orders, not suggestions,” the editor said.
Focusing exclusively on the poll's Qatar-related results, Arab News editor-in-chief Faisal J. Abbas expressed “surprise” at “how quickly the diplomatic row has negatively affected ‘Brand Qatar,' at least in the US… It was interesting to see that despite the billions spent by Qatar on various soft power initiatives — from education to charity to international sport — the study found that more Americans associate it with supporting terror than anything else,” Mr. Abbas wrote.
Mr. Abbas made no reference to the fact that like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have deployed huge sums to hire a battery of U.S. public relations and lobbying firms in a bid to garner support for their positions. Nor did they discuss what return on investment they have had.
Reputation matters
Striking a slightly more cautionary note in one of several commentaries on the YouGov poll published by Arab News, Sir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador to the kingdom, noted that “Saudi Arabia has ground to make up here, which is an important policy point for decision-makers in Riyadh: Reputation matters in the modern world and you do not improve that without a smart, targeted and sustained communications strategy.”
Last month, a random online YouGov poll suggested that of those asked whose side they were on in the Gulf crisis, 23% opted for Qatar and only 9% for Saudi Arabia. Two thirds of the respondents said they did not know enough to choose sides.
The results of the survey of U.S. public opinion notwithstanding, Qatar appeared to be faring better than the poll results suggested. A majority of Arab and Muslim states have refrained from joining the UAE-Saudi-led campaign, which is backed by less than a score of African and Asian nations, who are dependent on the oil-rich Gulf States in financial and/or political terms.
The international community almost unanimously has refused to endorse the UAE-Saudi-led alliance's conditions for resolving the Gulf crisis. The United States, the European Union, China and Russia have effectively backed Qatar's call for direct talks between the Gulf States and its detractors — a proposal rejected by the alliance.
Nobody buying it
The prominent journalist and pundit Rami G. Khouri noted that:
[The alliance's] problem with [its] display of political bravado is that nobody else buys it, and they are awkwardly isolated in their tent woven of threads of bravado. This is mainly because their accusations are wildly exaggerated, and also hypocritical on core complaints like funding Islamist movements, having relations with Iran, or interfering in other states' affairs. The Saudi-Emirati media propaganda pushing such accusations has been embarrassing in its ultra-thin doses of truth, and wildly counter-productive, serving only to further damage the credibility that some GCC media did enjoy in recent years.
Mr. Khouri argued further that “in the court of global public opinion, the Qataris appear to be much more sensible, consistent, focused, and precise, while the Saudi-Emirati-led states seem to express genuine anger and fear accompanied by unrealistic and unreasonable demands, but without convincing evidence for their accusations.”
The UAE-Saudi-led alliance has demanded that Qatar shutter Al Jazeera and other media outlets, reduce its relations with Iran, expel Turkish troops and cut ties to militant and Islamist groups irrespective of whether they have been proscribed by the United Nations or the United States.
Qatar has rejected the demands as an infringement on its sovereignty.
Twisting the truth
To many, the dispute in the Gulf amounts to the pot blaming the kettle and twisting the truth to serve rival narratives that fuel their public relations and media wars.
Literally all parties to the dispute are suspected of having had, at least at some points in time, links to militant groups. All, apart from Saudi Arabia, maintain often flourishing economic relations with Iran and many have foreign military bases on their soil.
In an article detailing the Gulf rivals' investment in Washington public relations and lobby firms some four years prior to the current Gulf crisis, investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald stated:
An investigation into an alleged sexual abuse case at a northwest Iowa school more than one year ago has led to the arrest of a southeast Iowa man.
According to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, the charges against 38-year-old Kyle Ewinger of West Burlington, stem from the investigation into an alleged incident that took place in the fall of 2015.
Sibley-Ocheyedan Superintendent Bill Boer said in 2015 that on a Saturday morning, they discovered Ewinger asleep in their classroom with a Sibley-Ocheyedan student. They said that Ewinger, who at that time was a Sibley-Ocheyedan Middle School social studies teacher and football coach, was terminated in October of that year.
Court records indicate that after the student originally said that nothing sexual happened that night, they are now saying something of a sexual nature did happen.
Ewinger is charged with second-degree sexual abuse.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Just eight weeks after losing an election, former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was charged on Wednesday with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in an investigation over billions of dollars missing from a state fund.
Najib pleaded not guilty, but the charges, the first of their kind faced by a Malaysian premier, and their court appearance were the culmination of a swift and stunning downfall for the man who led the country for nearly a decade.
“I believe in my innocence and this is the best chance to clear my name,” Najib told reporters outside the courtroom after being released on bail of 1 million ringgits ($247,000).
Crowds of journalists and onlookers jostled for a glance of Najib, and some of their backers chanted and held up placards in support of a man whose father, Malaysia's second prime minister, is held in high regard.
National television networks broadcast live images of Najib's convoy moving through morning rush-hour traffic to the court in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, an extraordinary spectacle few could have imagined before the May 9 election upset.
Najib thwarted corruption allegations for three years after revelations in 2015 that hundreds of millions of dollars from troubled state fund 1MDB were diverted to their personal accounts.
But their life has unravelled since the election defeat by their one-time mentor and the country's most seasoned politician, Mahathir Mohamad, who returned to the prime minister's office they occupied from 1981 to 2003.
Mahathir reopened an investigation into the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and barred Najib from leaving the country. Wednesday's charges fulfilled an election promise to prosecute Najib, whom they called a “thief” during the campaign.
Najib has been charged with abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust, each of the four charges carrying prison terms of up to 20 years. The abuse of power charge also carries a fine of five times the “value of gratification”.
They were ordered to surrender their passports and the judge set the trial for Feb. 18 next year.
Wednesday's charges relate to funds of about 42 million ringgits ($10.4 million) that allegedly went from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit, into Najib's personal bank account.
This represents a small fraction of the $4.5 billion the U.S. Department of Justice has said was misappropriated from 1MDB, which is being investigated in at least six countries on suspicion of money laundering.

Malaysia's attorney general indicated there could be more charges in the case as the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission continues its investigations.
SRC has been the initial focus of Malaysian investigators as all the suspicious transactions involving it went through Malaysian entities, unlike other 1MDB-related transactions that went through foreign banks and companies.
The judge imposed a temporary gag order to stop public discussion of the case. Najib's lawyers have said their client has been dragged through a trial by the media.
FAMILY QUESTIONED
Najib entered parliament at 23 and attained the top job in 2009, setting up 1MDB shortly after, but their second term in office was plagued by allegations about the fund.
Mahathir, who helped Najib's political ascent before turning on them as the accusations surfaced, led a campaign to unseat him, appealing to voters' disgust with a government apparently mired in corruption.
Mahathir told Reuters last month that embezzlement and bribery using government money were among the charges being considered against Najib, adding that their former protege was fully responsible for the 1MDB scandal.
Since the election loss, investigators have seized luxury handbags, jewellery and other items worth nearly $275 million from properties linked to Najib's family.
Their wife Rosmah Mansor and stepson Riza Aziz have also been questioned. Riza is the co-founder of Red Granite Pictures, a company U.S. prosecutors say financed three Hollywood films, including the 2013 Martin Scorsese movie “The Wolf of Wall Street”, with funds misappropriated from 1MDB.
Najib must be held accountable, said Anwar Ibrahim, the prime-minister-in-waiting and former opposition leader.
“Because of the allegations against them regarding 1MDB, they must be held accountable in court,” Anwar told reporters in neighbouring Indonesia.
In a pre-recorded message posted on Twitter after their arrest on Tuesday, Najib said they were not perfect and “not all the accusations against me and my family are true.”

Last year, Edwardsville came within a strike of winning regionals before losing to Belleville West 6-5 in eight innings in the O'Fallon Regional finals.
Every year Americans suffer from more than 50 million cases of foodborne illness, one of the most common conditions seen by medical professionals according to Dr Ross Rodgers, an emergency medicine physician at Penn State Health Milton S Hershey Medical Center. In fact it is so common it often goes undiagnosed or is confused for a stomach bug, with symptoms including nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. But there are a few ways to reduce your risk of getting sick from what you consume.While some cases are caused by eating out, others come from cooking at home, and even more come from contact with someone already infected due to foodborne illnesses being highly contagious."Most cases are self-limited and will resolve over the course of days," reassures Dr Brian McAllister, a gastroenterologist at Hershey Medical Center, who advises patients to stay well-hydrated and follow a bland, low-fat diet for a few days.However, if the symptoms come alongside fevers, bloody or inflammatory diarrhea, severe pain, or signs of dehydration such as dizziness, increased heart rate, muscle ache or fatigue, it's time to seek medical attention, and children and those who have chronic illnesses or suppressed immune systems should visit their doctor even sooner.Although it can be difficult to avoid ever coming down with a foodborne illness, both doctors suggest the following safety tips to minimize your risk.- Follow basic hygiene rules when handling food. "If all of us washed our hands and were careful with food, it would greatly reduce the number of infections we see," says Rodgers.- Don't use leftover marinade on cooked foods or use utensils that touched uncooked food to serve prepared items.- Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the meat is cooked to the appropriate temperature to kill any viruses or bacteria.- Although most people know to be careful with raw meat, seafood, poultry and eggs, some are not aware that the same types of viruses and bacteria can be present on produce and other types of food, so wash produce and leafy greens.- Summertime means more picnics and more cookouts, and this can also mean more time for food to spend sitting around. It's crucial to keep food refrigerated, especially in warmer weather, and not let it sit out for more than two hours. When temperatures pass the 90-degree mark, the time food can stay out decreases to just an hour.- When eating out, Rodgers recommends going with your gut feeling. "If the place seems clean and tidy, they probably follow good practices with their food. If it looks a bit shady, I would move to another place."
As marijuana shops sprout in states that have legalized the drug, they face a crucial stumbling block — lack of access to the kind of routine banking services other businesses take for granted.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is leading an effort to make sure vendors working with legal marijuana businesses, from chemists who test marijuana for harmful substances to firms that provide security, don't have their banking services taken away.
It's part of a wider effort by Warren and others to bring the burgeoning $7-billion marijuana industry in from a fiscal limbo they said forces many shops to rely solely on cash, making them tempting targets for criminals.
After voters in Warren's home state approved a November ballot question to legalize the recreational use of pot, they joined nine other senators in sending a letter to a key federal regulator, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, calling on it to issue additional guidance to help banks provide services to marijuana shop vendors.
Twenty-eight states, including California, have legalized marijuana for medicinal or recreational use.
Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said there are benefits to letting marijuana-based businesses move away from a cash-only model.
“You make sure that people are really paying their taxes. You know that the money is not being diverted to some kind of criminal enterprise,” Warren said recently. “And it's just a plain old safety issue. You don't want people walking in with guns and masks and saying, `Give me all your cash.“'
A spokesperson for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said the agency is reviewing the letter.
There has been some movement to accommodate the banking needs of marijuana businesses.
Two years ago, the U.S. Department of the Treasury gave banks permission to do business with legal marijuana entities under some conditions. Since then, the number of banks and credit unions willing to handle pot money rose from 51 in 2014 to 301 in 2016.
Warren, however, said fewer than 3% of the nation's 11,954 federally regulated banks and credit unions are serving the cannabis industry.
Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Assn., a trade organization for 1,100 marijuana businesses nationwide, said access to banking remains a top concern.
“What the industry needs is a sustainable solution that services the entire industry instead of tinkering around the edges,” Taylor said. “You don't have to be fully in favor of legalized marijuana to know that it helps no one to force these businesses outside the banking system.”
Sam Kamin, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law who studies marijuana regulation, said there's only so much states can do on their own.
“The stumbling block over and over again is the federal illegality,” they said.
The federal government lumps marijuana into the same class of drugs as heroin, LSD and peyote. President Obama's administration has essentially turned a blind eye to state laws legalizing the drug, and supporters of legalizing marijuana hope President-elect Donald Trump will follow suit.
Trump officials did not respond to a request for comment. During the presidential campaign, Trump said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana and has expressed support for medicinal use. But they also have sounded more skeptical about recreational use, and their pick for attorney general, Alabama U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, is a stern critic.
Some people in the marijuana industry say the banking challenges are merely growing pains for an industry evolving from mom-and-pop outlets.
Nicholas Vita, CEO of Columbia Care, one of the nation's largest providers of medical marijuana products, said it's up to marijuana businesses to make sure their financial house is in order.
“It's not just as simple as asking the banks to open their doors,” Vita said. “The industry also needs to develop a set of standards that are acceptable to the banks.”

The apparent relationship between Trump‘s inner circle and Russia could rival the political scandal of Watergate, warns veteran journalist Dan Rather.
The full magnitude of the situation with Russia could very well be yet to be seen, Rather said in a Facebook post Tuesday, as the situation continues to cascade “in intensity seemingly by the hour.”
READ MORE: Trump's people were in constant contact with Russians during campaign: reports
“Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now.”
“It was the closest we came to a debilitating Constitutional crisis, until maybe now. On a 10 scale of Armageddon for our form of government, I would put Watergate at a 9,” Rather wrote.
Rather pegged the “Russia scandal” at around “a 5 or 6,” as of Tuesday afternoon.
“We may look back and see, in the end, that it is at least as big as Watergate. It may become the measure by which all future scandals are judged. “It has all the necessary ingredients, and that is chilling.”
The post came amid the resignation of Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn, after it was revealed he'd misled Vice-President Mike Pence and other officials about their contacts with Russia.
This follows a conclusion by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia tried to influence the outcome of the presidential election, and was behind the email hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).
Democrats are demanding an investigation into the extent of Flynn's conversations surrounding U.S. sanctions against Russia, what Trump knew of the situation, and when.
The White House said Flynn's actions pose no legal issues; “eroding” trust forced their resignation.

Rather reflects on their experience chasing the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, which resulted in the resignation of then-president Richard Nixon. The Watergate case was a complex web of events; it's still unclear just how much Nixon knew of a plan to hack the office of the DNC, but they did go to great lengths to cover it up.
When it comes to the emerging Russia situation, as far as Rather is concerned, “the White House has no credibility on this issue,” and a full investigation is warranted.

“We need an independent investigation. Damn the lies, full throttle forward on the truth,” Rather wrote.
They then compared the situation to far-fetched Hollywood movie.
When your segment on an MTV docu-series starts off with a straight up war between your family and the family of your soon-to-be baby's mother, it kind of sets the tone. For Ashley Jones and their boyfriend on the newest Teen Mom installment, that's the case, so they definitely didn't have it easy starting off. But who is Ashley dating on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant? Unlike the younger moms of previous shows in the franchise, Ashley is already 20 years old, so she's definitely not a teenage mother and their boyfriend, Bariki (Bar) Smith isn't underage either. They actually lived together in Las Vegas before discovering that Ashley was pregnant with their daughter, Holly. However, it seems as though Bar's side of the family is proving to be a great source of drama as the couple try to adjust to parenthood.
In the Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant premiere, there was a lot of focus on Bar's relationship with their mom and while they and Ashley don't seem to get along, like at all, they aren't above calling them both out for the negative effect their relationship had on not only the baby shower planning, but the event itself. Although he's young and still apparently trying to figure things out, though, it seems like Bar had no problem stepping into the role of expectant dad. And, judging by their Instagram, he's still entirely devoted to both Ashley and Holly.
For Bar, it seemed only natural for them to continue to build their relationship with Ashley. As they told their mom on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant, "I plan on building a future with them You rock for me hard and that girl rocks for me real hard too." This basically confirms the fact that their relationship with Ashley isn't going to be ending anytime soon, despite their close relationship with their mom.
Although the show has yet to air its entire first season, in November 2017, Bar even proposed to Ashley, which they later posted on social media. So any issues related to their relationship with their mom (whether or not the hostility between the two of them is still going on after filming), that doesn't seem to have deterred Bar from feeling ready to fully commit to Ashley. In the show, Ashley is going to school in order to get a steady job for themselves while Bar continues to be on the lookout for any work opportunities that present themselves.
They recently post a photo from Times Square in New York at the beginning of March and commented to someone that “next time won't be business,” so they definitely seem to have something in the works, though it's hard to say what exactly that entails right now. They also have their personal Instagram page switched to private and opened an account dedicated solely as their public Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant account, so there's always the off chance that there are more personal details on their private social media accounts that we just aren't privy to see.
The most important thing about Bar and Ashley is that they've been able to remain together and start to build their life together with their baby, despite all of the family drama that seems to follow them. And as long as the series gets a second season and keeps the same set of young moms, fans will be able to continue to follow their story for years to come.
Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant airs on Mondays at 10 p.m. EST on MTV.

The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) has said little is done to protect the children from the perils of the digital world and to increase their access to safe online content.
Pointing out that one in three internet users worldwide is a child, the agency in its State of the World's Children 2017: Children in a Digital World report on Monday, highlights digital divides and explores current debates about the impact of the internet and social media on children's safety and well-being, Xinhua reported.
"For better and for worse, digital technology is now an irreversible fact of our lives," said Unicef Executive Director Anthony Lake. "In a digital world, our dual challenge is how to mitigate the harms while maximizing the benefits of the internet for every child."
The report explores the benefits that digital technology can offer the most disadvantaged children, including by increasing their access to information; building skills for the digital workplace; and giving them a platform to connect and communicate their views.
"The internet was designed for adults, but it is increasingly used by children and young people, and digital technology increasingly affects their lives and futures," Lake noted.
The report also examines how the internet increases children's vulnerability to risks and harms, including by misusing their private information, accessing harmful content, and cyberbullying. The report notes that the ubiquitous presence of mobile devices has made online access for many children less supervised, and potentially more dangerous.
Moreover, digital networks, like the "Dark Web" and cryptocurrencies, are enabling the worst forms of exploitation and abuse, such as trafficking and "made to order" online child sexual abuse.
According to the report, young people are the most connected age group. Worldwide, they have a 71 percent presence online compared with 48 percent of the total population. However, African youth are the least connected, with around three out of five not online, compared to just one in 25 in Europe.
It also reveals that more than nine in 10 child sexual abuse URLs are hosted in Canada, France, the Netherlands, Russia and the US.
The report says that only collective action by governments, the private sector, families and children themselves can help level the digital playing field and make the internet safer and more accessible for children.
“Losing Streak Lois” just drew a hand that could send them to death row.
The state of Florida wants to execute gambling addict Lois Riess for allegedly murdering a woman then stealing their identity.
The 56-year-old Blooming Prairie, Minn., grandmother rolled ashore in Florida as they were being sought by Minnesota cops in the March death of their husband, David.
Cops say Riess met Pamela Hutchinson, 59, on April 4 at a local watering hole and struck up a friendship. The gambling addict — nicknamed “Losing Streak Lois” for their luckless ways in casinos — was spotted the next day at Hutchinson's condo.
They were last seen driving away in the dead woman's white Acura.
Hutchinson's lifeless body was found April 9 in their home. They had been shot twice.
But Riess was long gone, using the dead woman's credit cards to check into hotels and order room service. They also withdrew $5,000 from Hutchinson's bank account.
Cops believe that Riess was high-tailing it to Mexico before turning up at a Motel 6 in South Padre Island, Tex.
At the time they were nabbed, Riess was in the process of grooming another victim, detectives said.
But a sharp-eyed bartender dropped a dime on them from the bar where they were drinking with two men.
When officers arrested the gambling grandma, they found 9-mm and .22-calibre handguns, a holster, duct tape, rubber gloves — and Hutchinson's credit cards.
Riess was charged with first-degree murder. Now, the Lee County state's attorney has expressed their desire to send Riess to the big adios.
They have also been charged with forging $11,000 in cheques from their husband's business account. To date, they have not been charged with their murder.
It's somehow fitting that Erin Hills was a golf course sculpted by colliding glaciers about 20,000 years ago.
Fittingly — from all known predictors — the pace of play in the 117th U.S. Open could mirror those giant ice masses.
Five hours may be considered a lightning round as 156 golfers traverse around 7,700 yards of undulations and unpredictability.
Balls that don't hit the unusually large fairways are at risk of being lost in the giant fescue that seems to grow exponentially with each rain, which it did on Monday and Wednesday. More rain is expected Friday and Saturday.
Fourteen of the 18 holes have blind or semi-blind shots.
The bunkers have been set up as punitive, deep and unforgiving.
And this course is brand-spanking-new to all but a handful of golfers who have played it in the 11 years it has been open.
“If you have a lost ball, that's going to wreck pace of play,” said Fox Sports analyst Paul Azinger, a former pro who won 12 tournaments, including one major. “You can't see the ball coming, so the marshals are handcuffed. Some of that fescue is so deep, it's not going to hop an inch.”
On Tuesday, the fescue was cut to about 4 inches on four of the holes.
The USGA, which runs this tournament, has a lot at stake after two problematic Opens.
Two years ago, a new Open course at Chambers Bay in Washington state was pilloried for its architecture, spectator accessibility and mostly its condition. The greens were in the kind of shape that left television viewers wondering whether the red and blue on their monitor was working.
Last year, winner Dustin Johnson's ball moved on the fifth hole of the final round. The action caused a thundercloud of uncertainty because the USGA didn't announce its rules decision until after the round. Johnson did them a favor by winning by three strokes, making the stroke penalty moot. There is a new set of rules for instantaneous decision-making this year.
Some players, in muted golf-speak, are less than thrilled with another new course in two of the last three years.
“I probably do prefer the more traditional ones, just because there is a lot of history involved in those,” said Justin Rose, who won the U.S. Open in 2013. “I definitely see the big picture of why new venues are important. But I think the rotation from now on is incredibly stellar and incredibly traditional.”
Even Andy North, who won two U.S. Opens and is an unofficial golf ambassador for Wisconsin, was a little cranky over the Erin Hills choice.
“To have it in our state is awesome,” North told Teddy Greenstein of the Chicago Tribune. “But to me, the U.S. Open is Medinah No. 3, Oakmont, Oak Hill, Oakland Hills, Pebble Beach — historic traditional golf courses.
“I truly believe that a big part of the U.S. Open is the history of it. And it's hard to have that history when you come to new courses.”
The next five U.S. Opens are at courses that have hosted the event before. In 2023, it goes behind the previously secretive doors of L.A. Country Club for the first time.
Erin Hills has a traditional par 72, the first time for an Open since 1992, when the event was at Pebble Beach. The usual form is to take the easiest par five and make it a par four. But not here.
The starting and finishing holes are par fives, also unusual.
The prospect of going for an eagle on the 637-yard 18th could make for an exciting finish Sunday.
“I think most people would agree that if you have an option for an eagle, then you've got an option for a six,” said Jordan Spieth, who won this tournament in 2015. “I think the 18th hole here can produce both.
“It's a very difficult green with the prevailing wind because it's so flat on the green. It actually pitches from the middle of the green to the back. And downwind, if the greens are firm … it leaves an almost impossible shot if you're outside 120 yards just to hold the green.”
The last six majors have been won by someone who had never won, but that is more of a statistical anomaly.
One person without a major is 22-year-old Jon Rahm, who last year was the low amateur in the Open.
“It's like a links golf course on steroids; everything is a little bigger,” said Rahm, who won the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines earlier this year. “It's big greens, big slopes, you have to be able to lag putt. With all the slopes going off the green, you might miss the green by three feet, roll off to 30 feet and be able to putt it.”
The one person routing for bad weather is Phil Mickelson. They plan to attend their daughter's high school graduation in San Diego on Thursday, then hop a plane to try to make a 2:20 p.m. tee time.
It's a long shot, and by their estimation they need a four-hour weather delay, but that might be some gamesmanship. Other people have calculated that with a strong tailwind and a Gulfstream V cranked to the max, they could do it with only a 90-minute to two-hour stoppage.
If the rain is heavy overnight, officials may push back the morning round to let the course dry out. But if that happens, there will be those who say the USGA is rigging the system to let Mickelson play.
And the USGA doesn't want to start this tournament with another controversy.

Sun and clouds, few p.m. showers for Monday
FORT MYERS, Fla. — There will be a high of 85 degrees with some sun, clouds as well as a few possible afternoon and evening showers Monday, meteorologist Matt Devitt said.
PIQUA — Supporters packed into Edison State Community College's Robinson Theater on March 15 for the 19th annual Charger Athletics Reverse Raffle fundraiser to support Edison State athletics. A crowd of nearly 300 people attended the reverse raffle, which awarded one lucky ticketholder the $10,000 grand prize.
This year's event helped to bring in $19,271.86 for the athletics program through the sale of 330 tickets, a silent auction, and other activities. More than $12,000 in prize money was awarded to winning ticketholders, including the grand prize winner, the aunt of a Charger student-athlete.
“We had a tremendous outpouring of support for this year's event,” said Nate Cole, athletic director at Edison State. “The money we raise through this event helps to offset many of the costs that our athletic teams incur throughout the year. It also provides a lot of opportunities that our student-athletes may not normally have, such as participating in post-season tournaments.”
Nearly 20 additional items were available in a silent auction that were donated by area businesses, community members, and athletic teams, which contributed to the total raised.
“This year's event was one of the most successful events we've had in a while, and we have a lot of people to thank both from the community and right here at Edison State for making it happen,” Cole said. “We have something really great to continue building on.”
Originally known as the Charger 300, the Charger Athletics Reverse Raffle began in 2010 to provide funding for post-season play and to offset expenses beyond the Edison State athletics budget. The need for an annual fundraiser for the athletic department grew from the postseason success of Charger teams winning National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Region XII titles, District G titles, and moving on to compete at the NJCAA Division III Final Four.
Over the past five years, $95,801.78 raised from previous athletic reverse raffle events have been allocated to support the purchase of student-athletes' uniforms and equipment as well as provide facility upgrades and cover travel expenses associated with postseason play.
Edison State's teams compete in the Ohio Community College Athletic Conference and are members of the National Junior College Athletic Association Division II.

Economic Developers Alberta (EDA) recognized Cold Lake Rural Alberta Business Centre yet again this year.
EDA presented the local business centre with an award under the Business Retention and Expansion (BRE) category for small community/region with a population under 25,000 for its Raising the Roof in Rural Alberta initiative.
Rural Alberta Business Centre advisor Kathryn Hotte accepted the award. Hotte was also one of the presenters at this year's award ceremony held in Banff, Alta.
The Cold Lake Rural Alberta Business Centre had various achievements this year such as a 60 per cent increase in number of clients and a 50 per cent increase in workshop participants.
The centre also had several RABC business incubator graduates this year who have had increases in their business. The incubator program provides new businesses (under two years old) with guidance, mentorship, advice, free workshops and a space to rent.
“Our focus on outreach to the community with partnerships, and our usual marketing and PR to increase our exposure and our wonderful WOW's (Wisdom & Opportunities for Women) got a lot of attention,” explained Hotte.
The local RABC received the same award last year under the same category.
Hotte said that the conference is a popular one in the province and more than 400 delegates were in attendance at the event in Banff this year.
Attendees included economic development officers, city/town mayors and councillors, CEOs and executive managers from industry leaders.
The theme at the conference this year was Embracing Change, Creating Opportunity.
As a presenter at the event, Hotte chose to share Cold Lake's success story. They added that after their presentation called ‘Innovate and Incubate', many attendees were waiting to speak to them about the specifics of the incubation program.
They have been invited to conduct presentations in other communities in the North East region who also have an interest in business incubation.
From Metrocosm, and now on YouTube, we have a cool animation of the growth of the world's cities starting with Eridu, which had attained “city” status by about 3000 BC.
For each city, this map shows the date of the earliest recorded population figure, which is not necessarily the date when the city was founded. The size of each dot corresponds to its population at that time.
By 2030, 75 percent of the world's population is expected to be living in cities. Today, about 54 percent of us do. In 1960, only 34 percent of the world lived in cities.
Urbanization didn't begin in the 1960's. But until recently, tracking its history much further back than that was a challenging task. The most comprehensive collection of urban population data available, U.N. World Urbanization Prospects, goes back only to 1950. But thanks to a report released last week by a Yale-led team of researchers, it's now possible to analyze the history of cities over a much longer time frame.
The researchers compiled the data by digitizing, geocoding, and standardizing information from past research published about historical urban populations. The result is a clean, accessible dataset of cities, their locations, and their populations over time, going as far back as 3700 B.C.
As the authors of acknowledge, the data has a number of limitations and is “far from comprehensive.” Certain parts of world are better represented than others, and some well known cities do not appear until centuries after they were founded. That said, for such an ambitious project (the historical populations of every city ever built anywhere in the world), I think they managed to piece together an impressive amount of data.
Vin was waving to the crowd again. Newk was whipping one across the plate again.
The ageless Sandy Koufax was in the box seats, the new Sandy Koufax was on the mound, and the once-brilliant Dodgers were those Dodgers again.
Welcome back, summer. Welcome home, hardball.
On an early October night that appropriately felt like a warm July afternoon, the Dodgers began their long-awaited postseason Friday with a raucous, rollicking flashback.
Remember when everyone thought they could be the best team in baseball history? Before everyone thought they were the worst team in baseball history? Well, after a few hours of brilliant hitting, sturdy pitching and serious snake crushing, everyone can feel free to jump back on the belief wagon.
To be more precise, the Dodgers opened the first round of the playoffs by punching the Arizona Diamondbacks right between their wide eyes in a 9-5 victory in front of a full house at Dodger Stadium.
“It was fun,'' said Cody Bellinger, and was it ever.
It was closer than it should have been, the Dodgers allowing a 7-1 lead to shrink to 7-4 after consecutive seventh-inning homers by Ketel Marte and Jeff Mathis against Clayton Kershaw, whose seventh-inning playoff ERA as a starter is now 25.50. But the Dodgers countered with bullpen cleanup and Justin Turner's fifth RBI, and all was well.
It's only the first game of a best-of-five National League Division Series, but in the Dodgers' last 15 postseason series, the outcome of the first game mirrored the outcome of the series.
The best images from Game 1 of the Dodgers' National League division series with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
It's only nine innings, but this thing felt finished after one, the Dodgers rolling rattled kid pitcher Taijuan Walker for four runs in the first before they recorded an out, the big hit being a Turner three-run homer into a partying mass of fans in the left-field pavilion.
“It's just nice to jump on them early,'' said Corey Seager of Walker. “It's nice to win Game 1, get the momentum and move on from here.''
It was only one night. But goodness, what a night, one that featured dancing fans, a flurry of waving blue towels, rattling cheers and Hollywood stars reading lines from their movies. When the video board showed Tom Hanks, they wagged their finger at the crowd and mouthed the words, “No crying in baseball.''
That is usually good advice for Dodgers fans in October, as the team has made 10 consecutive postseason appearances without a World Series championship, the longest such drought in history. But for once, those words were not needed.
All this, and Dodger fans throughout Los Angeles could actually watch them on television, the national networks taking over during the postseason for the mostly blacked-out SportsNet LA.
For those first-time viewers, that big guy making nifty plays at first base is Cody Bellinger, that little guy scoring two runs is Chris Taylor, and this is really how the team played for most of last summer.
The night began when Don Newcombe, the Dodgers' 91-year-old legend who practiced throwing a sponge ball for two weeks in anticipation of this moment, delivered a perfect first pitch from in front of home plate to their protege Kenley Jansen.
The charm continued in the middle innings when the video board showed Vin Scully sitting in the crowd. They immediately stopped their conversation and stood and waved to a roaring crowd that has missed them terribly.
Dodgers fans have also missed this kind of baseball, the sort that pushed the team to a 52-9 stretch at one point during a regular season during which they were once on a pace to record the most wins in major-league history. Memories were quickly dimmed when, late in the season, this same team went 1-16, a stat that's scary because no club since 1900 has gone into such a nose dive and emerged as a World Series champion.
But these were the good Dodgers, right from the start, beginning a first inning that featured the same sort of offense that led them on this summer's amazing streak. It helped that they were facing a very nervous Walker, a kid making their first postseason start after admitting they can't even stand watching these sorts of games.
Taylor led off by lashing a full-count single. Seager drew a full-count walk. Then Turner drove a two-strike home run into the left-field pavilion, shaking the packed stadium down to its studs.
Up next, Bellinger, who drove another two-strike pitch up the middle for a single. Yasiel Puig then scored them on a double to the center-field wall after a brilliant nine-pitch at-bat.
“It was exciting to hear the crowd roar in the first inning,'' said Bellinger.
It was trademark 2017 Dodgers excellence. Grinding plate appearances, unselfish swings, working the pitcher, moving the line, wearing out arms and whittling away at resolve.
“This is what we've talked about from this offseason, wanting to bring that trophy back to L.A. to fans who have been waiting a long time for it. It's the fifth year in a row for some of these guys, trying to do everything we can to make it happen,'' said Turner earlier this week. “It's about doing the little things.”
Walker finished the inning and was then quickly pulled after allowing four runs on four hits in one 48-pitch inning in their their postseason debut. The Diamondbacks must now come back in Game 2 Saturday night with another pitcher with a bit of baggage.
Robbie Ray has stifled the Dodgers in their five starts against them this year with a 3-0 record, 2.27 ERA, 53 strikeouts and just 12 walks. But by taking the ball Saturday night against Rich Hill, they are essentially pitching on short rest, as they threw 34 pitches out of the bullpen in the Diamondbacks' wild-card victory on Wednesday.
“We made it here for a reason,'' said Ray. ”We're not just limping our way in.''
The Dodgers nearly had to limp their way out of Friday night, but survived, and Turner warned fans to get used to it.
“No lead is safe in playoffs, no team going to roll over and quit,'' said Turner. “It's going to be an emotional ride of ups and downs. If we limit our downs and ride our highs as much as possible, we've got a chance.''

The South Korean baseball club Doosan Bears announced their signing of American right-hander Josh Lindblom on Monday, parting ways with long-time ace Dustin Nippert in the process.
The Korea Baseball Organization team said Lindblom agreed to a one-year deal worth $1.45 million. The 30-year-old will be entering their fourth KBO season; he'd spent the first three with the Lotte Giants.
The contract talks between Lindblom and the Giants fell through last week. And only hours before the Bears made their signing official, Lindblom tweeted a message to their fans -- both in Korean and English -- accusing the Giants of "dishonesty and unprofessionalism" in their approach at the negotiating table.
Lindblom was the Giants' ace for 2015 and 2016. They returned to the United States to better take care of their daughter Monroe, who was born with a heart defect, but rejoined the Giants in July this year. They were 5-3 with a 3.72 ERA in 12 regular season games, and made two postseason appearances, too.

Lindblom's signing means the Bears have bid adieu to Nippert, who has been the team's top starter since 2011.KBO clubs are each allowed a maximum of two foreign pitchers. The Bears signed another American hurler, Seth Frankoff, on Sunday.Nippert, the 2016 KBO regular season MVP, earned $2.1 million in 2017 when they were 14-8 with a 4.06 ERA in 30 starts. Though still solid, these numbers weren't nearly as impressive as those from their MVP-winning season, when Nippert was 22-3 with a 2.95 ERA in 28 appearances. Nippert was also shaky in the postseason this year, as the Bears failed to win their third straight title.The Bears initially sought to retain Nippert, 36, but at a much lower price tag. And to work around a rule on re-signing foreign players, the Bears at first told the KBO they wouldn't retain Nippert and then started their negotiations with the pitcher from scratch.If a club informs the league office of its intention to re-sign a foreign player, then the team must offer them a salary worth at least 75 percent of their previous wage.In Nippert's case, the Bears would have had to offer them at least $1.57 million, and the club balked at the figure.And because the Bears said they initially had no intention of retaining Nippert and their talks broke down anyway, Nippert is now a free agent, eligible to sign with any KBO club. If the Bears had shown an intention to re-sign them and they weren't able to agree to term, then Nippert wouldn't have been allowed to sign with any team in South Korea for five years.Following the Bears' acquisition of Lindblom, the Giants, the NC Dinos, the Samsung Lions and the KT Wiz each have an open spot for a foreign pitcher. The LG Twins are trying to bring back two pitchers from last season, David Huff and Henry Sosa. (Yonhap)

WASHINGTON There were prayers and expressions of sympathy for the victims after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game, but no signs of a new push in the U.S. Congress to tighten gun-control laws on Wednesday.In a country where there are almost as many guns as people, gun ownership is fiercely defended by firearms industry lobbyists and Republican politicians, who now control the Senate, the House of Representatives and the White House.In addition to the shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, a man dressed in a UPS uniform and armed with an "assault pistol" opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) package sorting hub in San Francisco, killing three people before turning the gun on himself, police said.Also, one man was shot outside a shopping centre near a major sports arena in New York City on Wednesday but it was not immediately clear who opened fire or how badly the victim was hurt, police said.Despite the day's carnage, there was no immediate indication that President Donald Trump or their fellow Republicans would shift from their position protecting gun ownership rights. Pro-gun voters lean heavily towards the Republican Party. Several House Republicans who attended a briefing following the shooting were asked by reporters about the need for gun control legislation. “Everyone was focused on the facts of the case” and what might be needed to enhance lawmakers' security, said Republican Representative Barbara Comstock.The lawmakers did not indicate gun control was discussed. Immediately following mass shootings, politicians typically are hesitant to talk about partisan legislative matters.Aides to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, whose panel would have jurisdiction, were asked if Wednesday's shootings showed the need for legislation. A reply from Goodlatte, provided by aides, said their “prayers are with Congressman Steve Scalise” and the others injured.
Spokesmen for the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful pro-gun rights lobbying group and a Republican Party ally, were not immediately available for comment.Democrats, who generally, though not uniformly, are more aggressive about gun control laws, expressed concern following the Alexandria incident, in which Republican Representative Steve Scalise and several other people were shot."There are too many guns on the street," said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat.Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year, said, "We've got to stop the violence."Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, who described themselves as a strong supporter of gun rights, told reporters that "does not mean we should not have universal background checks" to gauge gun buyers' mental health and to check on whether they are on terrorism watch lists. "It is entirely appropriate to ask those questions," Ryan said of expanded gun control legislation.
Many Republicans recently have opposed expanded background checks for gun buyers and limiting access to assault rifles.Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, has worked to oppose new federal gun controls that they have seen as an assault on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms."We don't expect the solutions to this issue ever to be found in the wake of a single tragedy no matter who is shot, no matter how horrific it is," Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a telephone interview.Gun control groups are fighting federal legislation that would relax existing gun laws, especially after Republicans backed by the NRA fared well in last November's elections.
The Republican-controlled House this year passed a bill making it harder for veterans who have been deemed mentally incompetent to be turned down for gun purchases.Gross said that despite the House vote, the measure "is not going anywhere in the Senate."He also said gun control organizations have held back passage in Congress of legislation giving states with concealed weapons laws reciprocity in all other states.A year ago, Congress was in a gun control debate after the shooting deaths of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Democrats ramped up their pro-gun control push, staging a filibuster in the Senate and a "sit-in" in the House to disrupt Republican-controlled proceedings. In the end, no legislation passed either chamber to tighten access to guns.Chelsea Parsons, vice president for guns and crime policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, noted however, that since the 2012 shooting in Connecticut resulting in the deaths of 20 first-graders and six staff members at an elementary school, several states have imposed new limits on gun sales. "There's going to come a breaking point in the disconnect between what Congress is willing to do and what the American people demand," Parsons said. (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James Dalgleish)

Thomas Edward Tanner, 64, of Alton, died at 1:27 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 10, 2017.

Wind gusts that helped push a massive wildfire into Santa Barbara County this weekend were growing weaker Monday, but authorities say the week-old Thomas fire still threatens the coastal enclaves of Carpinteria, Summerland and Montecito.
After watching the fire race west over the Ventura County line and explode to 230,500 acres overnight, firefighters struggled to increase overall containment to 15%.
“Wind was probably not the biggest factor last night to this morning — it's probably more the complex terrain, very dry and possibly widespread fuels for the fire and the fact that it's a pretty large and ongoing fire,” said Robbie Munroe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
The fire is in the top five of California's largest modern fires. On Sunday, it had surged into the Santa Barbara County foothills, forcing evacuations in the coastal communities of Carpinteria and Montecito.
As the fire grew Sunday, containment had dropped from 15% to 10%, authorities said. By Sunday evening, the blaze had scorched 230,000 acres.
The number of structures destroyed stands at 798, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Wind speeds are expected to be on the lower end of what's been seen over the last week, forecasters say.
Over Sunday night and into Monday morning, there were wind gusts of around 20 mph across the lower mountains and foothills in the region of southeastern Santa Barbara County into southwestern Ventura County.
The strongest winds are expected more toward the Ventura-Los Angeles County line, Munroe said.
“Even that is not expected to be particularly strong, but since it's so dry out there it doesn't take much in the way of winds to create those critical fire weather conditions,” they said. “We'll see wind gusts in that ... area between 20 and 35 mph, maybe a few mountain sites might see up to about 40, but that's the most we're expecting right now.”
The winds near the Thomas fire might be a little bit stronger from the north later on Monday night into early Tuesday morning, Munroe said, possibly 5 mph stronger.
“Right now it doesn't look too terribly strong, but really any increase in wind is something to watch out for given this fire's history.”
Since it erupted near Thomas Aquinas College north of Santa Paula on Dec. 4, the Thomas fire has forced 88,000 people to flee their homes. Official estimates have put the cost of combating the blaze at $25 million.
In Los Angeles County, firefighters made progress on blazes in Sylmar, Santa Clarita and Bel-Air. The Creek fire was 95% contained, and the Rye fire was 93% contained as of Sunday evening. The Skirball fire was 85% contained.
In northern San Diego County, the Lilac fire, which was 80% contained, had burned 4,100 acres and destroyed more than 100 structures along the Highway 76 corridor that stretches west from the 15 Freeway through Bonsall and Fallbrook.

Zoe Lusk, a two-time USA Swimming Scholastic All-American and NISCA All-American from Palo Alto, California has verbally committed to swim for Duke University in the fall.
“I am extremely excited to announce my verbal commitment to swim at Duke University! Thank you to all of my friends, family and coaches that helped me get to this point! #gobluedevils”
Lusk considers themselves primarily an IM/breaststroker but their strong backstroke and freestyle make them much more versatile. They swim for Palo Alto High School and for Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics under Tony Batis. Lusk was runner-up in the 200 IM (2:01.10) and third in the 100 back (54.90) at 2017 CIF-Central Coast Section Championships in May; they led off Paly's winning 200 medley relay (26.02) and sixth-place 400 free relay (52.27). They then went on to the California State Meet and took fourth in the IM and tenth in the backstroke.
In club swimming Lusk competed at Winter Junior Nationals West in the 100 back, 100/200 breast, and 200 IM individually, and led off PASA's 200/400 medley and 800 free relays. They also swam legs on the 200 free relay and 400 free relays.
After notching PBs in the LCM 100/200 free, 100 back, 200 breasts, and 200 IM at California/Nevada Sectionals in July, Lusk went off to compete at FINA/airweave Swimming World Cup 2017 #3 in Eindhoven, Netherlands. There they swam the SCM 200 free, 100 back, 100 breasts, and 200 IM, reaching the final of the 100 back. They also led off a PASA mixed medley relay, picking up a SCM time for the 50 back.
Top SCY times:
50 back – 25.35
100 back – 54.90
200 back – 2:00.13
100 breast – 1:03.16
200 breast – 2:15.88
200 IM – 2:01.10
400 IM – 4:20.80
100 free – 50.68
200 free – 1:49.36

Just as Ryan Getzlaf and Jakob Silfverberg returned Monday, another key Ducks player exited.
Corey Perry's right knee collided with Carolina Hurricanes winger Jeff Skinner during the first period, and Perry, the former 50-goal scorer crashed to the ice in a heap.
They lay face-first on the ice for a few moments before they finally gathered themselves and slowly skated to the bench with the help of trainers.
Perry was officially termed doubtful to return with a lower-body injury.
If Perry's prognosis is as bad as it looked, it will be another big blow for a Ducks team that seemed to finally be gaining its health.
Perry leads the team with 22 points, and is one of a few key players to skate in all 31 games so far.
The all-star struggled with just 19 goals last season, but he's seemed rejuvenated during this campaign, and was finally reunited with their longtime linemate, Getzlaf, on Monday.
But now, the Ducks' top line might be missing a key component once again.
There are fewer than 10 episodes left, and a lot more people on “Game of Thrones” are going to die.
(This is hardly news, but since talk of recent events will follow, there are in fact spoilers ahead.)
We're not just talking about the blink-and-you-miss-them Noah Syndergaards of George R.R. Martin's world, the armor-bearing redshirts whose screen time serves as kindling for dragons or pincushions for Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and the like to slash and stab. Or even the still smoldering Tarlys — Dickon we hardly knew ye! — who paid a heavy price this week for refusing to bend the knee to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). These are major characters who viewers have followed for nearly seven seasons to see them wind up on opposing sides (in some cases).
And although — surprise! — a water-logged Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) resurfaced quickly in this week's episode to end any misguided speculation about their fate, there's really no guarantee for how much longer they will survive. (Though, surely they have plenty to live for given he's about to be a father again. Or at least that's what Cersei told him.)
This overall lack of sanctity for life is the bargain “Game of Thrones” established when it broke the mold for every prestige TV series by killing off the name first atop its opening credits in Sean Bean's Ned Stark in the first season. It's that weirdly real-world ruthlessness that led to reaction videos being circulated around the Internet capturing viewers who were unfamiliar with Martin's ability to kill their darlings howling over the “Stark-pocalypse” of “The Red Wedding” and the (albeit fleeting) death of Jon Snow.
As the series went on, however, that familiar invincibility for key characters in TV drama began to return. Unmoored from the books for answers after the series outpaced Martin's output for “A Song of Ice and Fire,” many grew to expect Snow's resurrection with a general idea that the show had invested too much in their character's development.
The same could be applied to the rest of the Stark children, presumptive queen Daenerys Targaryen and the surviving Lannister siblings. Aided in part by Peter Dinklage's Emmy-winning performance, Tyrion in particular simply had been around too long and stayed too close to the center of the story to fall in a “Red Wedding”-type surprise before the series reached its endpoint.
But with eight episodes to tidy up a battle for the Iron Throne to the south and what will presumably be a continent-encompassing war for humanity with the Night King's ice zombies to the north, the end game is already here. And, given the show's track record, there's no reason to believe everyone will survive.
With that in mind, the act of checking social media after the series has aired on the East Coast – or, worse, a few days later – and registering any expressions of shock opens up any number of grim possibilities. Though this week wound up constituting a catch-your-breath sort of episode that made time to reintroduce the wayward Baratheon bastard Gendry (Joe Dempsie) and further tease Jon Snow's true parentage, viewers got a taste of what lies ahead for the series last week when the “Loot Train Attack” landed Jaime in hot water (sorry) in the first place.
Watching that battle unfold amid Internet rumblings of a surprise being in store – aided, perhaps, by the HBO leak before the episode aired – Jaime seemed the obvious choice for a possible fatality given their choice to be on the wrong side of a fire-breathing dragon. But “Game of Thrones” at its most effective has a knack for choosing a zig when viewers (or readers) are expecting a zag. For a little while anyway, everyone seemed in play as a possible victim.
There was newly questionable tactician Tyrion lingering on some hillside amid the battle, for some reason – would they somehow meet their end in all the chaos? What about the fun-loving mercenary Bronn, would they regret their distaste for armor? And could showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff be crazy enough for Daenerys' fate to take a turn after their dragon was struck by that giant crossbow?
Not that time, it turns out, but it's a testament to the show's track record of indifference toward expectations that has made this show such a phenomenon. But with the end coming up faster than anyone would like — especially HBO — fans should most likely consider these dramatic teases warning shots.
All men must die, as the show says, a phrase that practically functions as a subtitle. With dangerous work ahead for Jon Snow north of the wall, Littlefinger up to their old tricks in Winterfell and Cersei proving themselves increasingly short-tempered with so-called betrayals from their brother in the south, don't say they didn't warn you.

Related Coverage Death toll rises to 12 in London apartment building inferno
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — About 60 buildings in Grand Rapids fit the definition of a high-rise — six stories or taller. High-rise buildings don't burn often, but when they do, the results can be disastrous.
Twelve people were confirmed dead after a fast-moving inferno swept up and into the 24-story Grenfell Tower apartment building in London early Wednesday — and the death toll is expected to rise. Desperate adults trapped in the building tossed young children, including baby, from windows to people on the sidewalk below.
Generally, fires start and burn on the inside, but building material on the outside of Grenfell Tower seemed to help the fire spread. At least one resident said fire alarms never went off.
“We haven't seen a fire like that one … happen in the United States since the MGM Grand Hotel fire,” Grand Rapids Fire Chief John Lehman said, referring to the November 1980 blaze in Las Vegas that killed 85 people. “That hotel had exterior components that contributed to the spread of the fire in that situation. Building codes and restrictions since have helped us to stay a lot safer than that in the United States.”
Among Grand Rapids' high-rises is the 11-story Ransom Towers on Ransom Avenue NE north of Fulton Street. The building, with its 153 apartments, was built before sprinkler systems were required by law, but Lehman says there are alarms and other safety features. The building's concrete design is another safety factor.
“That actually helps us when we talk about firefighting in a structure like this — keeps things in their little container and if they get out, we're able to manage it a lot more easy,” Lehman said.
So what do you do if you're in a high-rise and the fire alarms sound? Lehman says it depends on how close to the fire you are.
“You should evacuate if you can. If the hallway is clear and the stairways are clear, you should evacuate,” Lehman said.
Don't take the elevator. If it's working, it could stop on the fire floor.
Also make sure you shut your door on the way out. If the fire starts in your apartment, shutting the door could keep it from spreading. It could also keep the fire out.
If you can't get out of the building, you should go back to your apartment or office and close the door, Lehman said. Your biggest concern should be the smoke, so try packing something like a wet bath towel under the door to block it out. Then find a way to let firefighters know where you are.
“In a building like this,” Lehman said of Ransom Towers, “where you have access to a balcony, go out onto that balcony area and make sure you call and notify 911 of your location in the building.”
High-rise fires are tricky for firefighters. While they burn in a smaller, contained space, they tend to burn hotter. Firefighters also have to climb to get to them. Ladder trucks only reach about seven stories.
While firefighters train to deal with them, residents need to have a plan as well.
“Building residents should be able to understand what their role is in the event of a fire alarm. They should practice that. They should discuss that with their family members,” Lehman said.

× Coachella concertgoers track man accused of stealing over 100 phones, leading to arrest
INDIO, Calif. – A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of stealing more than 100 cellphones during the Coachella Art and Music Festival, officials said Monday.
Authorities said that several concertgoers noticed their phones were missing and activated their “Find my iPhone” feature, according to the Indio Police Department.
Some victims were able to find and follow the suspect, identified as Reinaldo De Jesus Henao. They were eventually detained by security and arrested by Indio Police officials.
Henao, of New York, allegedly had more than 100 cellphones in their backpack. Several phones were returned to their owners and the remaining ones were turned into lost and found, officials said.
Henao faces grand theft and possession of stolen property charges.
Indio Police advise concertgoers to place their wallets or phones in their front pocket and to use an elastic band around their items to prevent them from sliding out.
Officials also advise those enjoying the festival to consider taking a “dummy wallet” to confuse potential thieves, and to spread valuables instead of keeping them in one place.

LAHORE - The Lahore High Court on Monday dismissed petitions seeking establishment of a shadow cabinet to eliminate the menace of corruption from the country.
Justice Atir Mahmood announced the verdict they had reserved on March 7, holding that although courts can direct the government to make amendment in law but cannot direct the legislature to make amendment in the Constitution which is the sole prerogative of the Parliament regarding formation of shadow cabinet at both provincial and federal level, because there are no fundamental rights of citizens being affected.
AK Dogar of Lawyers' Foundation for Justice and Opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Mian Mehmood-ur-Rasheed had moved the petitions submitting that establishment of shadow cabinet was inevitable in the current political system to have check on the working of the government. The both petitioners emphasized that shadow cabinet is practiced in all those countries where there were parliamentary system of governance.
AK Dogar argued that the system of shadow cabinet made the roles of opposition really effective and they were not cut out from the day-to-day governmental functions. They asserted that the parties in opposition were rendered helpless they had not share in power; the majority rule was converted into dictatorship of the majority.
AK Dogar pointed out that the British parliamentary system was mother of all parliamentary government of the world and it had shadow cabinet and this format had been followed by a number of countries run with parliamentary system including Canada and Japan. They said that the shadow cabinet system was very useful as it could scrutinize and examine all the activities of the ministries and had full access to the record of every case. They said the system of shadow cabinet was the first step towards the accountability and all kinds of corruption will be promptly curbed at the first stage. They said that the government had the power to create a shadow cabinet.
They requested to direct federal and provincial governments to act upon constitutional requirements of cabinet system and direct opposition leader to appoint shadow cabinet and assign functions to establish system of checks to eradicate corruption and miss-governance. Sheraz Zaka, the counsel of Rasheed, argued that there should be a shadow cabinet, as it would enhance accountability and transparency. They said that Punjab was a big province and single opposition leader could not keep checks and balances on the government. They pointed out that the Constitution had salient features which include also justice and fair play principles and by relying on such principles there must be a shadow cabinet.
They said that although there is no explicit provision of shadow cabinet but the court can direct to legislate on such public importance issues. The petitioners prayed the court to order the government to establish Shadow cabinet.
BASRA CASE
The LHC directed parties to come up with more arguments in a petition filed by PPP leader and ex-MPA Shaukat Mahmood Basra seeking state protection/security due to serious threats to their life.
Advocate Sardar Khurram Latif Khosa, the counsel of the petitioner, submitted that suspects involved in a recent life attempts made on Mr. Basra in Haroonabad on February 6 were being provided full leverage and had also been extending threats to their client and their family. They also alleged that the PML-N government had hatched a conspiracy to kill Basra.
They prayed the court to order the police authority to provide the protection to Mr. Basra and their family with adequate security to ensure their fundamental right of being protected. However, Justice Muhammad Yawar Ali sought more arguments from the parties.

Students at W.C. Miller Collegiate in Altona will see upgrades to their cafeteria once they return to class in the new year.
2016-2017 Student Council President Thomas Wolfe says that with the help of janitorial staff, four new microwaves have been installed, a counter with USB charging ports set up, and additions made to a seating area with steps for students to sit on.
The 2015-2015 Student Council started the seating area project, and after hearing recommendations from administrative staff, Wolfe says council "decided to finish it, and add a few little things to it."
Although Wolfe has not heard any feedback yet, they say students seem eager to use the seating area.
Final touches on the upgrades are expected to be completed over the holiday break.
10 current WWE Superstars and what happened on their WWE debut (Part 3)
Braun Strowman and Nikki Bella had memorable debuts!

Braun Strowman and Nikki Bella both made big impacts on their debut
With so many WWE Superstars making their main-roster debuts since WrestleMania 34, it got us thinking about how some of the established members of the current roster performed on their first appearance inside a WWE ring.
Braun Strowman, for example, has become one of the company's top Superstars in a short space of time, but do you remember their first opponent? And do you know who Jinder Mahal faced in their very first WWE match?
Sportskeeda is the one-stop destination for latest WWE rumors and wrestling news.
In this article, the third in a three-part series, we select 10 current WWE Superstars who debuted between 2005 and 2015 and check out how they fared when they were thrown into the WWE spotlight for the first time.
#10 Zack Ryder (2005)
Zack Ryder won the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 32
Zack Ryder has appeared sporadically on WWE television for the last 11 years but their association with the company actually goes back to 2005, when they competed as Brett Matthews in a squash match against Matt Morgan.
Morgan, making their first in-ring appearance in over a year, was paranoid that Ryder was laughing at their speech impediment and took their frustration out on the rookie with a series of power moves.
Ryder barely got any offence in and was defeated after just 78 seconds when Morgan drove them into the mat for the 1-2-3 after a twisted vertical suplex.
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Jack Morris continually got choked up during a press conference at the MLB Winter Meetings when talking about their entrance into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Quite a difference from the emotions they used to display on the mound.
Morris was all business, a man possessed, taking no prisoners when facing the opposition hitters.
But, when asked on Monday about their short time pitching for the Blue Jays, the St. Paul, Minn. native was all smiles, insisting that though their time in Toronto was brief and their performance somewhat inconsistent (at least in the second year of their tenure), they have nothing but fond memories playing north of the border.
Playing on those two World Series teams in T.O. inevitably helped propel them into the Hall, they added.
“Toronto was big in my heart,” Morris said. “I loved playing against the Blue Jays in my early years with Detroit and Minnesota. And Canada was a big part (of my life).
“I'm an avid fisherman and northwest Ontario was my favorite place on the planet. So going to Canada was a no-brainer for me. I'm a northern kid. I enjoy the cold, crisp air. It invigorates me. I never liked hot, humid days.”
Morris, who was elected into the Hall by the Modern Era Committee along with their former Tigers teammate Alan Trammell, played for the Jays during their World Series years, 1992 and 1993. And while their first year in Toronto was stellar (21 wins), they struggled in their second year and was unable to pitch in the playoffs because of a season-ending injury.
Despite that, Morris said they wouldn't have changed their two years in Toronto for anything.
“I can't say enough about how much I was appreciated in Toronto. I worked for the Jays on the radio, it was a wonderful experience,” they said. “I wish I could have convinced my wife to stay and move up there, because I'd still be there. I loved it.”
Morris' radio partner on the Sportsnet radio broadcasts was Jerry Howarth, who said Morris left the Jays' broadcast to be closer to their second wife Jennifer and their eight-year-old son Miles.
“That year in 2013 when they were my on-air partner I remember so vividly Miles coming to visit their Dad on a few occasions from St. Paul and sitting on their Dad's lap before games in the radio booth, just lovingly taking it all in but especially showing such great love for their Dad,” Howarth said.
“At the end of the season I said to Jack, who had become such a close friend, ‘Jack, as your friend let me suggest you do one of two things now. One, join me here on the radio for the next 10 years as my partner but you and Jennifer and Miles move here to Toronto. You know what the weather is like here and St. Paul has a very similar winter climate. Or, second, go back to St. Paul and find some part-time work with the Minnesota Twins to stay in baseball. I want you to do this for Miles. You don't want them to go from eight to 18 without their dad for all those months when you are away broadcasting baseball games. Do this for Jennifer and your son.
“He called me that off-season from St. Paul and said, ‘Jerry, thank you very much for what you suggested. Jennifer and I talked it over and we are going to stay here in St. Paul so I can be with Miles. I asked Sportsnet if I could get out of my contract and commitment to the broadcasts and they said yes. I appreciate what you did for me.'”
Morris said some of their best friends in baseball where guys they played with in Toronto, including Tom Henke, Duane Ward Jimmy Key. Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter.
“Even Pat Borders, who I called ‘Buffy' because they were always flexing in front of the mirror,” Morris said with a laugh.

If we needed any reminding, The Amazing Race Canada proved once again Tuesday night that you can't judge a book by its cover.
And Leanne's and Mar's biggest competition wasn't from someone like, say, ripped football coaches Dylan Elias and Kwame Osei but two other women, retired barrel racer Nancy Csabay and former skeleton racer Mellisa Hollingsworth.
The “cheerleaders,” Leanne Larsen and Mar Lyon, finished the leg in first place. Retired air force pilots Chewy Liddle and Happy LaVerdiere were the ones who got eliminated.
In the kickoff to Season 6, the Heroes Edition, the teams that ended up at the top and bottom weren't necessarily the ones you would have thought if you were letting stereotypes be your guide.
But they had company since navy colleagues Zainab Ansari and Monica Demian got lost on the drive to Squamish.
Their first clue took them to the ferry docks for a trip to mainland B.C. and then to Squamish. At least one team has to get lost, right? This time it was Dylan and Kwame, who mentor kids through sport in Fort McMurray, Alta., and missed the ferry.
They're off: We began with an extended getting to know you segment before the 10 teams of heroes met host Jon Montgomery at the starting line, at Hatley Castle on the Royal Roads University campus in Colwood, British Columbia.
Based on all that I'd say we're off to a good start. The Race is at its best when it's unpredictable.
Never fear, it wasn't real-life, furry national symbols strung up 500 metres above the canyon floor but stuffed animals that the racers had to grab by leaping off a bouncy mesh net on a bungee cord.
Everyone eventually made it to the Sea to Sky Gondola in Squamish and the top of Mount Habrich for the Road Block: “Who wants to save a beaver?”
Here was Chewy's and Happy's first bit of bad luck: they were in the lead, but Chewy failed to snag their beaver on the first try. Calgary firefighter Adam Kovacs and Brampton volunteer Akash Sidhu also needed second tries.
Nancy and Leanne caught their beavers right away and their teams were first to the next Road Block.
Beware of slivers: The next challenge was to climb an 80-foot pole at the Squamish Days Loggers Sports Festival and retrieve a clue at the top.
Nancy's partner Mellisa, whom it turns out they barely know, and Leanne's partner and friend Mar were first to climb. It was a workout and a half, according to Mar, and Mellisa complained they had slivers in their crotch, but they both made it and were off to the next task.
No one had a harder time on the pole than Vancouver volunteer Martina Seo. “I am not fit,” they said, nervously eyeing the height. “The type of challenges I'll be really great at will be baking or sewing.”
Can't say we've seen many of those on this show. Tearfully and almost quitting at one point, Martina inched their way up for their brother Phil. “I'm so proud of my sister, they didn't give up,” they said.
Likewise, nurse Courtney Berglind, who professed a terror of heights, pushed themselves for the sake of fiancé Adam, although they made quicker work of it than Martina.
Incidentally, these two may be the kissiest pair we've ever seen on The Amazing Race Canada. No action goes unrewarded by an “I love you,” a smooch or a peck.
Once everyone had climbed the pole it was time to go crabbing.
Pull up a crab: The teams had to drive to Darrell Bay, paddle out to buoys that marked crab traps, pull up a cage then paddle it back to shore. If the critter was regulation size it was off to the Pit Stop. If it was too small it was back to the buoys to try again.
The self-proclaimed Alberta cowgirls were in first place, but they didn't realize that the buoys marked traps and paddled past them, giving Leanne and Mar a chance to get ahead.
Several teams pulled up crabs that were too small and had to try again, including Chewy and Happy, Phil and Martina, and B.C. RCMP siblings Taylor and Courtney Callens.
Eventually everyone hauled in big enough crabs and the final five teams were neck and neck racing to the Pit Stop at the Britannia Mine Museum, which was once the largest copper mine in the British Empire.
The finish: Leanne and Mar reached Jon first and won a trip for two to Tokyo. “You better start liking sushi,” Mar told their partner. “The two cheerleaders just won the first leg of the Race,” noted Leanne.
Nancy and Mellisa, a former teammate of Jon's and a fellow Olympic medallist, were right behind them, followed by cancer survivor Todd Kirk and girlfriend Anna Holtby, Dylan and Kwame, and Taylor and Courtney.
Next came Zainab and Monica, Phil and Martina, and Adam and Courtney.
Akash and friend Joseph Truong got lost on the drive but beat Chewy and Happy in the foot race to the matt.
“For the guy whose call sign is Happy you can't even wipe the smile off your face right now,” Jon remarked.
Happy did indeed still look happy, saying it was “an honour to represent the men and women of the air force.”
With hugs all around, a couple of “I love you's” between the friends and a Wookiee sound (where Chewy got their nickname), they headed off.
The rest of the teams continue the Race in Dawson City, Yukon, next week, where the first Express Pass comes into play.
You can watch Tuesday at 8 p.m. on CTV.

Frank Ocean has been a Jeopardy! clue at least twice before, and their name came up on the show again last night. This time, the prompt required a depth of knowledge about Ocean's catalog that's probably beyond that of a casual music fan: “On this song from Channel Orange, Frank Ocean sings to a cab driver of their unrequited love for a man.” The song is critically acclaimed and socially important, but it's not exactly a hit. So it's not that surprising that none of the contestants were able to correctly respond, “What is ‘Bad Religion'?” Still a little disappointing, though.

For many people, buying and selling shares is a possible ‘get rich quick' scheme. Clearly, there are times when this will work. Sometimes share prices can move quickly and this can provide investors with high profits in a relatively short space of time. However, the reality is that the risks of buying and selling over a short time period are significant. Indeed, timing the market could prove to be an inferior strategy when compared to focusing on an investor's ‘time in the market'.

For many people, buying and selling shares is a possible ‘get rich quick' scheme. Clearly, there are times when this will work. Sometimes share prices can move quickly and this can provide investors with high profits in a relatively short space of time.
However, the reality is that the risks of buying and selling over a short time period are significant. Indeed, timing the market could prove to be an inferior strategy when compared to focusing on an investor's ‘time in the market'.
Opportunity cost
Perhaps the major risk of short-term investing is the opportunity cost from not holding shares for long enough. Even if a short-term investment works out as planned and an investor generates a high return, they are likely to then sell up in search of another opportunity. However, in many cases the optimum strategy could be to hold on to the company in question, since it may offer even greater growth in the long run.
Likewise, many short-term investors may seek to sell their underperforming shares. This can sometimes be a sound strategy, since there may be better opportunities elsewhere. However, often share prices are volatile and fluctuate in value. This does not necessarily mean they will fail to deliver high growth rates in the long run. Therefore, adopting a patient outlook can be highly worthwhile.
Lower returns
Some short-term investors will seek to take time out from investing if they do not see opportunities to profit. While having assets other than shares is generally a good idea due to the diversification benefits, not having enough exposure to shares means an investor will miss out compounded returns. Over time, they can make a large difference to overall returns, and it is long-term investors who will benefit, rather than their short-termist peers.
In addition, short-term investing is much more expensive than a buy-and-hold strategy. While the cost of buying and selling shares has fallen in recent years, frequent trading can still lead to high commission costs which eat away at overall returns. And with the effect of compounding factored-in, even a small difference in total returns after costs can lead to a significant difference over time.
Quality of life
While the primary reason for investing in shares is to generate a relatively high return in order to meet financial goals, quality of life may also be of importance to some investors. Short-term investing and attempts to ‘get rich quick' can lead to a significant workload as time is required to continually find new opportunities. This can affect an investor's quality of life, while the stress and worry of losing money on some investments can do likewise.
Long-term investing is usually less time-intensive, while investors generally find paper losses easier to cope with than ones which are crystallised. Alongside the potential for higher returns, this means that a long-term strategy may be a better option for most people when it comes to buying and selling shares.
The Alpena County Library crossed a major milestone over the weekend celebrating their 50th Anniversary in their current location.
Although the library has been around for over 157 years, this anniversary is special because the 1967, 305 North 2nd Avenue where the present day Water Street connects with Carter Street still encourages locals to read, and learn more through a circulation of 64,425 items.
“Alpena's lucky because this library has traditionally been a strong library serving this community. Libraries still are a big part of leveling that playing field in society where more and more people have access to technology but there's still a significance population that does not and the library is a great place to go to use computers, and a good place to go to fill out job applications, tax forms, and ask for help for homework or whatever it may be. Libraries still do a big part of making sure everyone in our society has access to information,” State Librarian of Michigan, Randy Riley said.
The guest book author at Saturday's event not only spoke about their book, and visiting islands and lakes throughout the state of Michigan, they noted how lucky the people of Alpena are to have such a great library on Lake Huron.
“I've not been to the lake shore in Alpena before, but I've been through Alpena with some family in Alpena when I was young. But I've never been to the Lake Huron shore here, and you're really lucky,” Notable Michigan Book Author, Maureen Dunphy said.
Senator Stamas presented a plaque in honor of the anniversary. There were other awards presented as well. Proceeds at the Story Book Gala will benefit the Library Improvement Fund.

The woman accused of attacking a Clinton couple with a pickaxe on February 10th 2017, has pleaded guilty.
Cassandra Doran pleaded guilty to willful injury causing serious injury and criminal mischief.
Doran entered "The Gazebo Antiques & Collectibles," grabbed a pickax for sale and began swinging at merchandise before attacking Bill Conely. Conely suffered multiple injuries, including a broken jaw in two places. The incident caused Conely to spend 30 days in the hospital for recovery.
Court documents show because of a plea agreement the state will consider dropping attempted murder and burglary charges.
Doran is set to be sentenced May 31st.
Last month NCAA Division III's Thomas More College announced it would be adding men's and women's swimming and diving programs beginning with the Fall 2018 season. The school has now announced it will be hiring Monty Hopkins as its first Head Coach.
Thomas More is located in Crestview HIlls, Kentucky and less than 15 miles south of Cincinnati, Ohio, a city with which Hopkins is very familiar after having coached the University of Cincinnati Bearcats for 25 years.
After positions at various club squads in Arkansas and Ohio, Hopkins is excited to get back to their college coaching roots. “We are interested in attracting students who want a great education and want to swim in college. It's a chance to form a team, create a culture and leave a legacy.”
The addition of the swimming and diving programs will bring the total number of athletic teams at Thomas More College to 26, with men's volleyball also being brought to the college in fall of 2018.
The school is a member of the NCAA Division III's Presidents Athletics Conference among the likes of Grove City College, Washington & Jefferson College and Westminster College.

The Saudi crown prince is making their first visit to Washington to shore up investments and political support from Riyadh's closest Western ally. Ten months after the last face-to-face meeting between Trump and Prince Mohammed bin Salman as deputy Crown Prince in Riyadh, the 71-year-old president and the 32-year-old strongman prince are expected to deepen an already warm and congenial relationship.
Several dozen Saudi chief executives have joined to tout investment opportunities in the kingdom, particularly in the areas of technology, entertainment and tourism, a Washington source said. Talks will also include a U.S. bid to build two nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia and a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement needed for that to proceed, an industry source said. Ahead of their visit to Washington, the atomic policy, which limits nuclear activities to peaceful purposes, was approved by the cabinet last Tuesday. The atomic ambitions of the key U.S. ally and regional power are coming under scrutiny in Washington at a time of growing tensions between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.
Riyadh wants to diversify its energy supply mix, enabling it to export more crude oil rather than burning it to generate electricity. But it has previously refused to sign any agreement that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium.
Washington's political agenda will feature a new push to end the dispute between Arab allies of the United States that have isolated Qatar over alleged ties to terrorism, a senior U.S. official has said, according to Reuters.
The crown prince is also likely to reiterate to Washington that Saudi Arabia's view that its regional rival, Iran, should not be trusted over its nuclear program.
The hugely influential Saudi prince Salman visited Egypt, Britain and the United States as part of a long foreign trip, their first as crown prince. They have a close relationship with Trump and their son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner, who is seen as having given the green light for Prince Mohammed's rush to consolidate power in recent months. Critics have labeled the crown prince's campaign a shakedown and power grab, although authorities insist the purge targeted endemic corruption as the country prepares for a post-oil era.
The longstanding relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, its main Middle East ally, is founded largely on the exchange of American security for Saudi oil. The 9/11 attacks that killed almost 3,000 people in the United States tested U.S.-Saudi relations, as 15 of the 19 Al-Qaeda attackers were from Saudi Arabia. After a long period of stalled relations under former U.S. President Barack Obama, the U.S.-Saudi relationship has renewed itself with the Trump administration. Trump chose to Saudi Arabia on their first foreign trip after taking office, arriving in May 2017 to much fanfare and ceremony. The partners announced major contracts worth more than $380 billion, including $110 billion for the sale of American arms to Saudi Arabia, to counter what they see as a threat from Iran and radical militants.

Mumbai: Despite greater fiscal autonomy and higher tax revenues shared by the Centre with states, 14 of 20 states surveyed cut spending on a key nutrition programme–Supplementary Nutrition Programme or SNP–that bridges the gap between a child's actual and ideal dietary needs, according to an analysis of national health-spending data.
The SNP is the most popular service under the national child-support system–the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)–as it is used by 35.6 percent of urban and 53 percent rural residents, according to data from the National Family Health Survey 2015-16 (NFHS-4). As many as 55 percent and 61 percent of India's lowest and second-lowest income classes, respectively, depend on the ICDS.
The fall in funding could jeopardise not just child health but, as a consequence, future productivity and economic growth; these cuts come three years after the Centre increased the states' share of net tax revenues from 32 percent to 42 percent and at a time when two out of three nutritional parameters improved over 10 years to 2016. The greater share of net tax revenues to the states followed the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission in 2015.
The funding cuts made to the SNP by the 14 states range from 3 percent to 55 percent over a year to 2016-17, according to a February 2018 budget brief published by the Accountability Initiative, a division of the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank.
The other six states–Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Karnataka–increased funding to the SNP over the same period (by 3 percent to 22 percent), data from the brief revealed.
The states that cut funding are: Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Tripura, Orissa, Kerala, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Nagaland.

Source: Budget brief, Accountability Initiative
Note: Change is for 2015-16 and 2016-17
Children are better off than before, but progress is slow
Spending on child health is central to making Indian children healthier–India currently trails not just emerging economies but many poorer countries on most parameters–the country's future workforce being more productive and increasing economic growth, IndiaSpend reported in March 2018.
India has slowly improved its ranking on a global healthcare access and quality index from 153 in 1990 to 145 in 2016, yet it ranks lower than neighbouring Bangladesh and even sub-Saharan Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, we reported on May 23, 2018.
Over 10 years to 2015-16, the proportion of Indian children stunted–short for their age–went down from 38 percent to 28 percent, underweight (relative to their age) from 43 percent to 36 percent, but wasting–thin for their weight–rose from 20 percent to 21 percent , according to NFHS-4 data.
The child-care funding cuts come at a time when the central government reduced its allocations to the ministry of women and child development over two years to 2016-17, before increasing it over the following two financial years.
The allocations for anganwadis (day-care centres) fell over two years to 2016-17 before rising again over the next two, according to the budget brief.
Funding cuts impacting anganwadis
Bihar's anganwadis were the worst affected, with no more than 80 percent working, while Sikkim, Maharashtra and Kerala were the least affected with 99 percent anganwadis operational.
As many as 76 percent of child development project officers and additional child development project officers posts were vacant on March 2017 in Maharashtra, while there were no vacancies for the same positions in Bihar and Mizoram, according to the budget brief.
West Bengal has the most anganwadi supervisor posts vacant (63 percent) while Madhya Pradesh has the least (17 percent). Nationally, vacancies were unchanged between March 2015 and March 2017, data show.

The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the plea for the chopping of the scenes from Padmaavat which were eulogizing 'Sati' and would adversely impact the viewers of the film.Rejecting the plea by petitioner, Swami Agnivesh, the bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said that once a film is given certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), then there is nothing that can constitute an offence.The court said this as counsel for Agnivesh sought registration of FIR against the producer and director of the film as scenes eulogising were against law banning Sati. Referring to the novel Devdas by eminent Bengali classic novelist Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, Chief Justice Misra said: "Read the book and see its celluloid version in which veteran actor Dilip Kumar has performed the role of main character Devdas - who turns alcoholic for the loss of love."Noting that the writer was critical of this character and never justified being alcoholic, they asked: "Has any lover become alcoholic because of the film Devdas", while telling the lawyer that they were "trying to make mountain out of trivial things".As the lawyer said that some of their friends have become alcoholic, Justice Khanwilkar said: "Sir, you keep bad company."Padmaavat which saw a lot of protests and resistance before its release, which saw the top court's intervention, was a roaring success at the box office. Featuring Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor, it was filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's take on 16th century Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic poem Padmavat.

Solo: A Star Wars Story stumbled at box office, marking the worst debut in franchise history — What went wrong?
The reaches of the galaxy far, far away might not be quite as vast as previously thought.
In a box-office blip that echoed through the multiplexes, Solo: A Star Wars Story didn't fare well over the Memorial Day weekend, amassing an estimated $103 million in ticket sales from Thursday night to Monday. Most movies dream of such openings, but the standard for Star Wars is different, as is the bottom line. According to Variety, approximately $400 million to $450 million are expected in total revenue at the end of its run.
Solo, which switched directors mid-production, cost more than $250 million to make and another $150 million to promote, and it was expected to debut with around $150 million. For the first time, the Star Wars juggernaut was humbled at the box office. The opening marked the worst debut in the franchise's history and Disney's stock slid 2.5 percent in trading on Tuesday.
“It's a financial disappointment and you have to wonder, is this just a speed bump in the road for the Star Wars brand, or is there something more here?,” Eric Handler, an analyst at MKM Partners, told Variety.

No one yet needs to run panicked through the streets yelling "Save the Wookies!" But for the first time since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion, the profit potential within George Lucas' space saga no longer appears limitless.
Instead of opening up a new Han Solo trilogy, the disappointing arrival of Solo only intensified the questions bubbling around one of the movies' biggest properties. Is there a filmmaker beside JJ Abrams that can win over both die-hards and new fans? How slavish should subsequent sequels and spinoffs be to the originals? Is there anyone in China who cares a lick about lightsabers?
Those problems came to a head on Solo, where filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were replaced during shooting by Ron Howard, who steered the film in a less irreverent comic direction that stayed closer to the script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan, the veteran Star Wars scribe of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Once envisioned as a western-style prequel romp, Solo became an existential battle over the tone of Star Wars, as Lucasfilm struggled to find a balance between old and new.
Last Jedi writer-director Rian Johnson is developing another trilogy in the main line of films. Game of Thrones creators DB Weiss and David Benioff will write and produce a separate batch of Star Wars films. Jon Favreau is writing and executive producing a live-action series for Disney's upcoming streaming platform. James Mangold (Logan) is to write and a direct a Boba Fett film. Rumours have long swirled about an Obi-Wan Kenobi spinoff.
The litany of releases has, for some, diluted the power of Star Wars. Solo followed The Last Jedi by just five months, leading some to wonder if moviegoers are showing signs of Star Wars fatigue.
But the best solution for Star Wars might be even simpler. A full half — and, arguably, the clearly weaker half — of the Star Wars canon follows events leading up to A New Hope. Solo, Rogue One and Lucas' little-loved 1999-2005 trilogy all function as preludes for what's the come.
So whatever changes need to be made in the Star Wars universe, Lucasfilm could start with this: Look to the future, and give up the prequel.

Yesterday, a lot of us (myself inclusive) were in a hurry to crucify and bury Donald Duke after excerpts of Okonjo-Iweala's new book ‘indicting' them made their way to the press. But after sitting down and reflecting on so many things and also seeing that some ethnic jingoistic have pounced on this (long awaited opportunity), I believe there's a need to do a sober rejoinder.
Okonjo-Iweala is a credible lady so it would be difficult to say they lied against Duke, the only thing we can categorically say is that what they said is being blown out of proportion. Firstly, in politics, interests are paramount. Secondly, the politics of undermining didn't start today.
Thirdly, NOI is not saint herself. Let me expatiate starting from the third point. A good friend of mine who is a nephew of NOI has severally told me of how NOI is loathed by a faction of the family due to their inability to bring the much-needed development to their Ogwashiuku community even after serving government for close to eight years.
They complained of how the roads in their community were in a deplorable state all through their stay in Abuja and how basic and how basic amenities are still out of their reach till date. According to my friend, it's Buhari's administration that saw to some of these amenities being but in place and this is the reason why they and some of the Okonjos supports Buhari.
Donald Duke saying what they said doesn't in anyway reduce their capacity to lead or govern Nigeria if/when offered the chance. I reminded a good friend of mine of how their beloved former governor Ibori did worse to ensure Jonathan didn't assume that seat. As was the rumor back then, Ibori pulled all the strings that they could to ensure Jonathan wasn't made acting President(after Yaradua's death) by the senate such that at some point, GEJ flew to Ibori's Oghara country home to plead with him.
Have we also forgotten how Awolowo fought tooth and nail to usurp their former protege, Akintola Williams who succeeded them as premier of the western region? In what led to the Ibadan riots and eventually precipitated the first military coup? Or more recently, how Tinubu who is still regarded as the Governor General is Yoruba politics, directed their ACN boys in the 7th National Assembly not to support the southwestern (Yoruba candidate) the PDP had nominated to be speaker and instead throw their weight behind a PDP northern so as to create an impression that Jonathan had marginalized the Yorubas and further undermine GEJ's leadership? And going to the southeast, can we remember how Francis Arthur Nzeribe allegedly sold weapons to the Nigerian state to use to kill their Igbo kin during the Nigerian civil war? Arthur Nzeribe still came back to become a two term senator ‘over their people' 30 years later.
Some minutes ago, I was going through feeds on Twitter and saw a tweet where Trump was lamenting about incessant moves by the democrats to undermine their leadership. They exclaimed that the Dems in the house had perfected plans to frustrate their ally, Pompeo from being confirmed as the next Secretary of state and also revealed that a number of ambassadorial nominees had their confirmations pended no thanks to the veto power held by the democrats' bloc in the house.
This also reminded me of a sad story I read in the Washington post during the Obama era, of a black American lady who was an old flame and rumored university lover of Obama. According to that article, Obama had sent their name to the US Congress for confirmation and it was pended by the republican controlled lower house for longer than possible in order to strain them emotionally and back at Obama. They eventually died of cancer whilst waiting for the confirmation.
Even the same Trump who has been crying all day was guilty of near treason on a number of times during Obama's administration as they made several extreme bids to undermine Obama- at a point, they went as far as instigating a racist secession bid. That didn't stop Donald Trump from going on to be President and that also hasn't prevented them from performing far above expectations since assuming office. In a nutshell, Duke is good to go as Nigerians have nothing on him!
PS: This article could have been longer but out of respect for Jonathan, I edited the part where I raised questions on what Cross River state and the south-south actually benefited from all the support they rallied for him.

Lahore - Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) executive committee chairperson Najam Sethi has claimed that there is a possibility of West Indies touring Pakistan after the final of Pakistan Super League second edition.
Talking to the reporters here on Sunday at a book-launching ceremony of Islamabad United, Sethi said that tour of West Indies for a T20 series against Pakistan was conditional upon final of PSL 2017 to be held here. “The West Indies have asked to make satisfactory security for the team. Pakistan will in return play two matches with the World T20 Champions in Florida, US.
Sethi had recently invited West Indies to play a two T20 matches in Pakistan in March 2017. They said that PCB was trying hard to end the drought of international cricket in Pakistan. “We gave a proposal to the WICB that after West Indies' tour to England on March 9, they can visit Pakistan between March 11 to 15,” they added.
Sethi said all outstanding matter could be resolved over a cup of tea with former skipper Shahid Afridi. They stressed on the issue of Misbah's retirement by saying that the decision was to be taken by the Test captain himself, not by the cricket board. “It is up to Misbah-ul-Haq, whether they want to retire from Test cricket,” they added.
Talking about issue over series with India, Sethi said Pakistan was ready for a tri-country fixture involving India on a neutral venue, however, whether the PCB would approach an international mediator or ICC in case of rejection is to be decided after deliberation with legal team.
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday indicated that it might direct lodging of FIR against the prison officials who had allegedly subjected several prisoners to severe physical torture at the Tihar Jail. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar orally said that it might ask for lodging of a criminal case against the people responsible in jail for the violence and listed the matter for 15 May.
Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, however, urged the court not to pass such an order, saying that there were around 15,000 prisoners in jail and such a direction would demoralise the police force. They said some of the most dreaded criminals were lodged in Tihar jail and if such a direction of lodging a case was passed, prisoners would use it as a tool against the authorities and it would be difficult for the officials to control the prisoners.
During the hearing, the court expressed unhappiness over the manner a lawyer argued the case while seeking to be impleaded as a party in the matter.
The counsel, who said they were representing 20 out of 21 inmates who were assaulted in the jail, was seeking copies of certain documents placed before the court by the authorities and said why there was a "purdah system". This submission annoyed the bench which said they were making such submissions for the gallery. The bench said that it cannot be browbeaten.
"You are doing a disservice to your clients by making such submissions. It is highly objectionable and such a conduct amounts to contempt of court," the bench said. The high court was hearing a PIL by advocate Chinmay Kanojia, who has alleged that their client Shahid Husuf, currently being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and undergoing trial, was beaten up without any reason by the Tihar Jail staff.
The plea by advocate Jawahar Raja said members of a particular community, including Husuf, were being targeted by the jail staff causing serious injuries to them and others. The court had earlier appointed a three-member fact-finding committee, headed by a District Judge of a trial court, to inquire into the incident, in which 21 inmates were allegedly beaten up by the jail staff, and submit their report before it.
Moved by the plight of the inmates in various jails and the poor living conditions there, the bench had asked the AAP government and Tihar Jail authorities "which law says that the prisoners should sleep on the floor".
When the incident was brought to the attention of the high court on 22 November, the court had set up a committee of senior high court judicial officers to look into the matter. The committee, in its report, opined that the inmates were beaten up without any justifiable reason.
It said that despite unequivocal statutory guidelines, an incident has been perpetrated where prisoners were beaten up with such severity that it had resulted in them harbouring a constant fear of being killed by the prison authorities on one pretext or another.
It had directed the authorities to ensure safety and security of the persons, who have been beaten up.
BOSTON (Reuters) - A group representing large investors voiced concern that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is undoing protections for shareholders to bring proxy resolutions opposed by management.
Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said their group disagreed with recent SEC decisions allowing companies including electric utility AES Corp to craft their own rules on the right to call special investor meetings, in place of versions proposed by shareholders.
“AES is playing games with this,” Bertsch said in a telephone interview late on Thursday, adding that existing guidance from the top U.S. securities regulator should have been enough to protect the resolutions.
The council, whose members include big pension funds and asset managers like BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group, raised its concerns to the SEC directly in a Jan. 31 letter seen by Reuters.
Under Chairman Jay Clayton the SEC has taken steps seen as favoring businesses, such as allowing companies to confidentially file paperwork for initial public offerings. Clayton said at a November conference they hoped to reconcile concerns about the cost of shareholder resolutions with the corporate governance improvements they can bring about.
Spokespeople for AES and the SEC declined to comment, and the SEC did not make Clayton available for an interview.
Shareholder resolutions have taken on a new importance as fund firms seek money from investors concerned about climate change and corporate governance. [nL1N1IX15V]
The SEC has already taken steps that could raise the bar for filers, such as allowing more resolutions to be skipped as “ordinary business.” [nL1N1OX1EX]
The AES resolution and a similar one at CF Industries Holdings Inc were filed by independent investor John Chevedden. Both called for shareholders with at least 10 percent of shares to be able to call special meetings, which can put pressure on management.
The companies requested SEC permission to leave the proposals off their proxies. Each company said it planned instead to offer shareholders a resolution to set the special meeting threshold at 25 percent of shares, a higher standard that could protect executives and directors.
The SEC sided with AES in December, and with CF on Jan. 30, saying Chevedden's measures conflicted with the management proposals. A CF spokesperson did not respond to messages.
In an interview, Chevedden said shareholders could logically vote for both standards to see which had more support. Now, they said, shareholders would “only get to hear management's side.”
At the request of a defense attorney, a Solano County Superior Court judge agreed Tuesday to postpone a probable cause hearing for Joel Melendez and Jorge Hernandez, two of four suspects in the December shooting death of a 19-year-old Fairfield man.
Despite confirming the court date last week, because of issues surrounding a witness and discovery evidence, Hernandez's attorney, Dustin Mason Gordon, asked for a continuance, delaying the hearing until at least to the end of February.
Jorge Hernandez, 18, of Fairfield, and Joel Melendez, 19, of Tracy, were arrested Dec. 15 after a police investigation of a Dec. 10 shooting that left the young victim, Sulpicio Rios, dead.
In December, both men pleaded not guilty at their arraignments. Hernandez and Melendez are each facing a murder charge.
Hernandez was arrested just before noon Dec. 15 in Fremont in the 45000 block of Fremont Boulevard. Melendez was arrested later that day at approximately 7:40 p.m. in Tracy.
The victim was shot and killed just after 9 p.m. Dec. 10 along the 800 block of East Travis Boulevard. Following the shooting, Rios was taken to a hospital, where they later died.
One other person also was injured in the shooting.
There are a total of four suspects in Rios' death, though names of the other suspects in addition to Hernandez and Melendez are being withheld by authorities because of their ages.
The fourth suspect in the homicide, a 16-year-old, was arrested Dec. 30 just before 6 p.m. near the 1000 block of McKinley Street without incident, police said at the time. Police surrounded the home on the night of Dec. 30 and instructed the suspect to come outside. They were then arrested on a homicide warrant with a gang enhancement, according to police.
The two men are scheduled to return to court at 8:30 a.m. Feb. 21 for a readiness conference. A new probable because hearing will likely be set at that court date.
For now, the adult suspects are being held in Solano County Jail without bail.
After being promised flying cars for the last 30 years, DeLorean is stepping up to change the game yet again and you won't need roads with this new vehicle. Except there is some competition this time around since Larry Page, Airbus, and Uber are all racing to develop a fully functioning flying car. Paul DeLorean, the nephew of John DeLorean has revealed their plans for a two-seater vehicle called the DeLorean DR-7 and it doesn't look like the classic DeLorean that we all know and love from Back to the Future, but it sure looks pretty cool. Doc Brown's words at the end of the first Back to the Future movie are finally becoming true.
Wired reports that the new DeLorean DR-7 flying car will be made of incredibly light materials and will include a special battery that will allow up to 120 miles in a flight, which is more than the other flying cars currently in development. The DeLorean DR-7 will also contain sophisticated computer controls as one would imagine. The flying car will be started as a personal transport vehicle and DeLorean hopes to have it fully automated. The entirely electric vehicle is set to be 20 feet long with a wingspan of about 18.5 feet.
The DeLorean DR-7 will have two sets of wings, which are capable of folding back for easy storage. The vehicle's takeoff and forward propulsion will rely on a pair of fans, which are powered by electricity and mounted along its center. The fans will reportedly swivel after takeoff to propel the flying car forward. DeLorean is aiming to make the vehicle self-driving so that anyone can use it without any special license and the company is expecting to have a full-sized flying prototype within a year with a plan to test it out in the California desert as a remote controlled device before they start to test with actual people in it.
The DeLorean was first released in 1981 for a mere $25,000 or over $100,000 in today's USD. There were roughly around 9,000 released before the DeLorean hit the skids, and it was only really popular among wealthy people until it was brought front and center in the classic 1985 movie Back to the Future as a stainless steel time machine that needed to reach 88 miles per hour and use plutonium before Marty McFly could time travel. Thanks to the popularity of the Back to The Future franchise, the DeLorean still holds its value and are relatively sought after. The classic DeLorean car will also be shown prominently in the new Steven Spielberg directed Ready Player One movie early next year.
Price points and a release date are not clear at the moment, but one can imagine that it will be a pricey endeavor, much like the release of the original DeLorean car back in the 80s. Even though the release date has not been announced, the flying car will have to go through a ton of regulation processes before one even comes close to hitting the market. It's pretty amazing that the time is finally almost here for flying cars and that they're in development at all. Now if we could only get some hoverboards into development...
Dear Amy: My husband and I have been married for 40 years. They own rental property, and last year a married woman moved into one of their houses. Them husband lives out of town and is expected to move here once they retire.
A few months ago, they and my husband began an affair. I don't believe it was sexual, but it was definitely emotional.
Once they started having dates with her, I told them to leave — it would be them or me. Their relationship had become too intense with constant texting, telephone calls and late-night visits.
They left, but came back to me shortly after, saying they had a long conversation and that they should “cool” their relationship.
Now, even though they have cooled, they continue to text, and they go to the house to “fix” things. They say they have no friends and they worry about them
I'm having a difficult time trusting them considering the hell they put me through.
They say they have no friends. I have no problem with them having a friend, but they overstepped their relationship big time. How do I handle this, since they are the landlord?
— Left and Bereft
Dear Left: This tenant needs to find another place to live.
I'm going to assume that they won't be moving, and so — because you and your husband are trying to repair your marriage, they should offer you complete transparency regarding ALL of their contact. They should not be receiving or sending “friendship” texts. They should show you all communication between them. And you should go on “service calls” with him.
Understand that at the end of the day, you are not responsible for your husband's lack of friends. They really does need to make a choice to fully commit to you, and so far, they don't seem to have actually made it.
Dear Amy: A close family member, “Clara,” concocted a completely false, salacious accusation about me, and — unbeknownst to me — spread it through the family.
This was about four years ago. Eventually, their own daughter bravely took me aside and told me about their mother's accusations.
Other family members corroborated that Clara had, indeed, spread rumors.
I'm really private and socially awkward. It took me a couple of years to get the nerve to bring it up, but when I did, Clara quickly deflected, telling me that the devil was filling my mind with lies and that I just needed to pray about it.
Clara never acknowledged that they were the source of the gossip.
Clara is a sanctimonious church-goer and advertises themselves to be a saintly senior citizen. They have never acknowledged the lies and gossip they spread, nor offered any apology.
I was blindsided. I was so humiliated that I wouldn't even go to the grocery store in my own town. I've worked through most of the hurt, but I have not forgotten.
I want to bring it up again, but I don't want to seem foolish or petty.
Is there any way to address this issue with her? Or should I let it go? The damage has been done and the gossip has been spread and I can't un-ring that bell, but I would still like to know what made them do that. I guess I'd like some kind of closure.
— Small Town Girl
Dear Small Town: You should prepare yourself for the likelihood that “Clara” will never reveal their motives for inventing and spreading gossip about you.
Gossip is about power and social currency. The person spreading it feels powerful being “in the know.” They also believe that putting someone else down through malicious and muckraking gossip increases their own social standing.
You should state your own truth and ask them to explain their motives. Tell them you would appreciate them correcting their misinformation, as well as an apology.
I hope you can do this, regardless of their reaction, because standing up for yourself is both graceful and empowering. That's how you get “closure.”
Dear Amy: Regarding the letter from “Torn,” I had an emotional affair with my boss many years ago. I met with a therapist after I left that job. They counseled that I never see them again.
By the time they and I met again a decade later, our ardor had cooled to the point where I wondered what I ever saw in him.
Torn should consider a “normalization meeting” with their husband, instead of their affair partner.
— Glad I Know Better Now
Dear Glad: Bingo!

The Eastern Illinois baseball team hit 26 home runs all of last season, and has already well surpassed that total this season.
This Panther team may be rebuilding, but the new talent combined with transfers and first-year student has provided a different look on the offensive end.
Eastern has hit 36 home runs already this year, and still have 20 games left on the season.
Now, it is understood that last year's team may have just really struggled with their power swings, but that takes nothing away from the recent success for the Panthers.
That power strike has been led by junior college transfer Matt Albert as they already have a team-leading 12 this season, with the most recent coming against Belmont Sunday.
It is also worth noting Albert already has three multi home run games on the year with still plenty to play.
Their wealth at the plate has been somewhat contagious for the Panthers as three other players have at least five home runs on the season, and that has been the complete opposite from last season.
In 2016, Eastern had one player on the entire team hit five or more home runs and that was Jason Scholl who led the team but is now graduated.
That has been the story for Eastern the season; growing as a whole and that is apparent through one statistic.
As far as wins though, the Panthers are still lacking yet nearing their total from a year ago.
With 20 games left on the season the team has already reached half its win total from all of last season.
The problem with that is the Eastern won just 15 games a year ago.
The 8-27 Panthers have been inconsistent this season and there really is no other way to describe a team that is clearly in its rebuilding stage.
While the increase in home runs has been nice to see, run scoring has still been inconsistent as well.
The team has quickly gone from scoring 18 runs in one game to scoring just four combined in the next two against Belmont.
But as coach Jason Anderson has stated before, this team has no problem competing with any opponent, instead, closing out games.
It is one game at a time for these young Panthers and now they take their momentum from Sunday's win into a single-game matchup against Butler Tuesday afternoon.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations' human rights chief slammed the Security Council on Monday for failing to “defend human rights and prevent further loss of life” as the war in Syria that has killed nearly half a million people enters its eighth year.

“The Syrian conflict has been characterized by its absolute disregard for even the most minimal standards of principle and law,” said Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein.
Saying that many who had sought to document human rights violations had been detained, tortured or killed, Zeid said: “The Security Council has not lived up to the sacrifice of these heroes throughout Syria. It has not taken decisive action to defend human rights and prevent further loss of life.”
The high commissioner for human rights spoke at an informal meeting at the United Nations shortly after their expected briefing to the Security Council was blocked when Russia requested a procedural vote.
The 15 members of the council attended the informal meeting.
Zeid was critical of the use of veto powers in the council to shield “perpetrators of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Syria and elsewhere” from justice.
Russia, the largest international backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has used its veto power nearly a dozen times on possible Security Council action on Syria since the country's civil war began in 2011.
“This failure to protect the lives and rights of millions of people is corroding not only the work but also the legitimacy of the U.N.,” said Zeid.
First Congregational Church of Stratford, 2301 Main Street is forming an inquirers class for those who may be interested in learning more about the church and membership.
The brief, initial informational meeting with Pastor Ed Rawls will be held after the 10 a.m. worship on Sunday, April 29.

Puducherry: Engaged in a running feud with Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry Kiran Bedi, chief minister V Narayanasamy on Wednesday hailed the Supreme Court's judgment on the powers of an elected government and insisted that it was "totally applicable" to the southern Union Territory, too.
The veteran Congress leader warned that they would file a contempt petition if the lieutenant-governor failed to act in accordance with the apex court verdict.
"I welcome the verdict, and it is totally applicable for the government of Puducherry, which is also a Union Territory," they told reporters.
They hoped Bedi would now change them ways.
"Whoever functions contrary to the judgment now delivered by the apex court would face serious action. I myself will file a contempt petition against those failing to act in consonance with the supreme court verdict," they said.

A multi-million-pound investment is being made at British Steel's Scunthorpe works to allow the company to step up production of a revolutionary rail product.
The manufacturer is investing a seven-figure sum in new plant which will allow it to produce its premium coated Zinoco rails in lengths of up to 108 metres and welded lengths of up to 216 metres.
It follows full approval being given by Network Rail for the ultra-long versions of the Zinoco product, the name of which derives from the words "zinc for no corrosion".
Zinoco is a world-first which can withstand the rigours of being laid in some of the most challenging rail environments, reducing the need for rail replacement programmes in highly corrosive areas such as coastal lines, wet tunnels, level crossings, mineral lines and salt pans.
British Steel designed the product in conjunction with Network Rail and initially delivered it in lengths of 18 metres, before conducting a series of trials with longer lengths.
The reduced number of welds required by longer lengths of rail mean the installation process can be sped up and also gives the rails greater integrity.
Over the last 18 months longer length rails have been installed in tunnels near Bristol and Fife, culminating in Network Rail granting full product approval.
Peter Smith, British Steel's managing director for rail, said: "Zinoco offers superior corrosion protection compared to all current rail coating technologies on the market so we're delighted Network Rail has given it full product approval up to lengths of 216 metres.
(Image: British Steel)
"We're the only supplier in the world able to deliver corrosion-protected rail at this long length so this is a great success story, not only for us but for British manufacturing."
Work is already under way on building the new plant to start production of the ultra-long Zinoco rails in Scunthorpe and British Steel is anticipating it will be commissioned this autumn.
Mr Smith said: "This investment underlines our commitment to innovation and the highest levels of product quality and service delivery.
"Network Rail, like other operators, was having to replace rail prematurely due to rapid corrosion in isolated segments of a network.
"We've worked closely with them to deliver Zinoco, a world first and a classic example of British Steel partnering with customers to provide a cost-effective solution to the challenges they face."
A Network Rail statement said: "This development will facilitate wider usage of coated rails supporting Network Rail in reducing re-railing activity in a number of key challenging locations in the future. This should ultimately support our aims of reducing the whole life cost of rail in these locations."

EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- Adrian Peterson said he'd love to finish their career with the Minnesota Vikings. Whether he'd be open to taking a pay cut to make that happen remains to be seen.
Peterson would not say Monday whether they would entertain a smaller deal from the Vikings, who have a team option on the running back for 2017 that includes a $11.75 million base salary and $6 million roster bonus. They sounded more open to the possibility than they have in the past but stopped short of saying they would accept less money from the Vikings after missing 13 games following a torn meniscus in September.
"There's the reality that there comes a point in time where, yeah, the best thing to do is take a pay cut and it might be in the best interest of the team, as well," Peterson said. "It's one of those situations where there are guys that are, I would say, worth putting the money into as well. Like, for instance, you've got a guy like Tom Brady or a guy like Antonio Brown -- you put more money into those guys than you would do. I'm not going to name any other receivers or any other quarterback, but then you do other guys. That is what it is. That's just how things go."
Editor's Picks Injuries punctuated roller-coaster season for Vikings From 5-0 to out of the playoffs, the Vikings' season will be remembered for injuries, renewed optimism and ultimately falling short.
Sam Bradford makes their case for future with Vikings Sam Bradford called their season "crazy" and a "whirlwind," but when all was said and done their accuracy and ball security were a real asset. 1 Related
The Vikings have to decide on Peterson's 2017 option by the start of the league year, and they would owe them the $6 million roster bonus if they were on the team by the third day of the league year. A restructured deal, then, would need to be completed sometime before the new league year begins on March 9.
Peterson also was asked whether they wanted to test free agency for the first time in their career.
"I think when that time comes, I'll cross that bridge," they said. "I've been taking in a lot here the past couple weeks -- just the fans here. Man, I've been here 10 years. We have a great team. We have some great things going on here in Minnesota. I would love to continue to be a part of that. That's how I'm thinking. It's not, 'Oh, free agency, I get to test this.' I'm not just going to write myself off here in Minnesota.
"I'd be lying to you to say that I haven't thought about, 'Well, what if we're not able to work things out?' So that crossed my mind. When thoughts just even cross your mind, you kind of sit back and think about all the times that you had here and your teammates and things like that."
Peterson, who had surgery on Sept. 22, came back three months after they were injured to play against the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 18, beating doctors' timetable for their return by a month. They tweaked an adductor muscle in their first week back at practice but felt good enough to play against the Colts, they said. They did not play in the Vikings' final two games of the season, and said Monday they "didn't feel comfortable" enough to play on Dec. 24 against the Packers.
"I don't think I rushed it back from the standpoint of protecting the meniscus," Peterson said. "It was just unfortunate that little things occurred that slowed me down."
Peterson said Monday that their meniscus was 90 percent torn in September -- meaning an operation to trim the damage, which might have had the running back on the field within a matter of weeks, was not something that team doctor Chris Larson recommended.
"If it was like 10 percent [torn], I would have trimmed it off and been back in a couple weeks," Peterson said. "But 90 percent of your meniscus being gone, especially with how it worked out and how I play the game, it could have been six months to a year before I was bone on bone. With me knowing I have a lot left in the tank, it would have been crazy to cut off 90 percent of meniscus. So that's why I had the option of getting it repaired and taking the long route."
Peterson, who turns 32 in March, said they could play another seven years.
"In my mind, I'm thinking if God's willing, I stay healthy, I'll play five more [years]," they said. "And it's going to be at a high level."
New England and Miami clash on Monday night in an annual battle between two teams with very different trajectories.
There are the Patriots, who at 10-2 are comfortably perched atop the AFC East, needing just one win in the final four games to clinch yet another division crown. Business is good as usual in New England.
And then there are the Dolphins, a team that entered the season with high hopes and renewed optimism even after losing Ryan Tannehill. Things haven't gone according to plan.
What you get with the 2017 Dolphins is uncertainty off the top, followed by surprise or frustration. The majority of Miami's games -- save for a few blowout losses -- have been one-score differences. The Dolphins didn't record a dominant win until last week's drubbing of the moribund Denver Broncos. A lot of it starts and ends with Jay Cutler, who's been competitive at best and disastrous at worst. Essentially, Cutler has served as the embodiment of Miami's season.
So this one should be a blowout, just like New England's 35-17 win over the Dolphins two weeks ago, right?
Not so fast. We'll explain why in this week's group of what to watch for in Monday Night Football.
1. Yes, we'll knock this one out right off the top: Miami has rarely been friendly to Tom Brady. The quarterback has come away with the most losses of any one location in their career (outside of their home of Foxborough), going 7-8 in 15 career games against the Dolphins in Miami. Blame it on the humidity, the fans, the Miami nightlife or the wizardry of Tony Sparano -- Brady historically struggles in the environment.
But these aren't the Patriots of old, or even of weakness. The early season worries about New England's defense have been all but vanquished, the Patriots have the league's best offense and they're facing a Dolphins team that can't decide whether up or down is the right direction. This contest looks to be the one in which Brady brings that record in Miami back to .500.
2. With Miami in a peculiar situation in terms of looking ahead, this contest -- and really, much of the last few weeks -- has no defined direction. While the league's bottom-feeders are spending the final month grasping at elusive wins or playing the youngsters to get a look at the future, Miami is largely constructed as a team that's supposed to contend now. At 5-7, they haven't done that. Mathematically, they still have a chance, but this could be the game that determines which direction in which the Dolphins want to move in the final month. Cutler is signed for just this season, but the future isn't healthy enough to play. Where we might see some inexperienced players see time is defensively, where the Dolphins are flush with younger guys. Against the league's best offense, perhaps this becomes a crucible game for that group, especially if New England takes a big lead early.
3. Gronk-less Pats. New England will again be forced to adjust without its star tight end due to their one-game suspension levied against them for a late hit in a win over the Buffalo Bills. Fortunately for the Patriots, this could be the best thing to happen to their offense. Unlike years past, when injury sidelined Gronk, New England knows he'll be back -- but has an opportunity to prepare for their absence in a game that isn't all that meaningful. Chris Hogan is also expected to play after missing time due to injury. Expect Josh McDaniels to test some different personnel groupings in a rare opportunity to toy with an offense in a late-season game.
4. Does Miami want to be here? The Dolphins aren't eliminated, but they'd need a whole lot of help, as well as a winning streak to somehow land in the postseason. The biggest thing to watch in the meantime, then, is how hard Miami plays down the stretch. The Dolphins are a veteran-laden team careening toward an 8-8 or worse finish. Will they give their full effort in these final games or pack it in? This is important, because it reflects how a coaching staff is connecting with its players. In year two, Adam Gase has seen their team take a step back. They seemed like it last week in a blowout win, but are the Dolphins still playing for him?
A Kalkaska County couple was back in court Monday as the murder case of Michael Brandt moves forward.
A friend found Michael Brandt dead in their home at the end of January.
The Kalkaska County Sheriff's Office investigation at the scene in Springfield Township led them to Brian and Jessica Degroot, Brandt's daughter and son-in-law.
Deputies arrested the couple and they're charged with their murder.
Brian is also charged with torture.
Monday afternoon the couple was back in court as the prosecution laid out their side of the story.
9&10's Caroline Powers and photojournalist Jeremy Erickson were inside the courtroom and continue our coverage.
“Large amount of blood in the entryway and on the freezer.”
Vincent Roys stumbled on a horrific scene when they showed up to check on their friend, Michael Brandt.
“Discovered there was a piece of carpet rolled up in the living and I picked a piece of carpet up and I noticed there were feet and a body in there and I noticed it was Mike, and I walked outside and called 911,” Roys says.
Forensic pathologist Dr. Stephen Cohle says Brandt was stabbed seven times. One almost severed Brandt's heart.
“I am confident I would conclude that this is a homicide,” Dr. Cohle says. “Just because of the distribution of injuries, the types of the injuries.”
Detective Scott Griffith interviewed Brian Degroot, Brandt's son-in-law.
“He had told me that Michael Brandt had been verbally threatening them and giving insults to them and that they had had enough mentally and physically and they reacted upon it,” says Dt/Sgt. Griffith. “He admitted they slashed the victim, Michael Brandt, on the back, that they stabbed them in the chest, and that they slashed them across the neck and the slash across the neck is what did it.”
Officers also talked about the conversations they had with the victim's daughter, Jessica.
“She stated they saw their father, Michael Brandt, with stab wounds and they heard Brian Degroot shoot them with a crossbow,” says Sgt. Dave Wagner, Kalkaska County Sheriff's Office. “Jessica said that Brian threw the knife and the broad head in the woods at the house and the other weapons were burned in the burn barrel at the house.”
The defense argued that Brian's torture charge be dropped.
“There's been no discussion of screams of pain or terror, or anybody coming over or length of time that this took,” says Kyle Trevas, defense attorney. “There has not been evidence offered that torture occurred.”
But the judge ruled in favor of the prosecution.
Both Brian and Jessica Degroot were bound over to circuit court.
MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Tens of millions of Americans in the Midwest and on the East coast will face brutally hot temperatures and stifling humidity as they celebrate the Fourth of July holiday on Wednesday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.

Heat advisories and excessive heat warnings were in effect through Wednesday night, with heat index values – which combine temperature and humidity – in major U.S. cities such as New York City and Chicago expected to reach well above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32°C).
At least four people have died due to the heat over the last week, including a Pennsylvania woman who died while working in their garden on Saturday and a man who was running a race in New York on Sunday, CNN reported.
For the Fourth of July holiday, Dan Petersen, an NWS meteorologist, warned people celebrating outside to remain in the shade and drink plenty of fluids.
“Anyone outside in locations with expanded areas of heat is going to have to take precautions,” Petersen said. “This is the peak of summer – the hottest time of the year.”
Later this week, a storm front is expected to roll through and cool down the eastern seaboard for the weekend, Petersen said, providing relief to Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia on Friday night before heading down to the Carolinas.
In a reversal of normal patterns, Petersen said, the hot weather will head west, hitting the central United States late in the week before reaching Los Angeles and San Diego on Friday.

Novokuznetsk, Russia – Three months ahead of Russia's presidential election, apathy and disappointment pervade incumbent Vladimir Putin's heartland.
Alexandra Chekh, a retired kindergarten director, voted for Putin the last time around in 2012. Now they wonder if they have anything to offer.
“Change? If they could do it, they would have done it by now,” they said. “If nothing gets done, then maybe we will need a new person.”
A new person is unlikely — the 65-year-old Putin is the overwhelming favorite in Russia's March 18 presidential vote. But the dim view taken by former supporters such as Chekh is notable in a city like Novokuznetsk, part of the Kemerovo region in southwestern Siberia where Putin tallied 77 percent of the vote in 2012.
The city itself lies 4,500 miles east of Moscow.
Since that last election, anti-corruption campaigner and adamant Putin foe Alexei Navalny has been able to spread their message far beyond the prosperous and educated urban circles of Moscow and St. Petersburg where their support started. But Navalny is saddled by a fraud and embezzlement conviction — which their supporters view as politically motivated — that will prevent them from running in the presidential race unless he's pardoned or some other dispensation is made.
Navalny is pressing on, nonetheless. On Saturday, several hundred people showed up at their rally in Novokuznetsk, a city of nearly 550,000 people that is home to coal mines, metals plants and soot-smelling air. Some at the rally came without hats or gloves despite the minus 5 degree temperatures.
Navalny focused on the grievances they have been highlighting throughout the campaign: low pay for state employees, the concentration of wealth in Moscow and the Kremlin's excessive funding for foreign policy forays.
Official statistics show the region's average monthly pay as 31,600 rubles ($532), a little under the Russian average. But Novokuznetsk residents think those figures are inflated by officials. When Navalny asked the crowd how much a nurse makes in Novokuznetsk, they shouted “10,000” or “15,000.”
If Putin's 18 years in power have induced apathy and a sense of helplessness among Russian voters, that's the big issue in Navalny's view.
Putin has made voters in industrial cities like Novokuznetsk their base, touting stability as the key achievement of their rule. But these days, finding a fervent Putin supporter on Novokuznetsk's snow-covered streets can be hard.
Of seven residents approached by an AP reporter, only four said they supported Putin. None of them expressed enthusiasm.
A survey by the independent polling agency Levada Center suggests that enthusiasm for Putin is in decline countrywide. It found that 51 percent of those questioned said they were tired of waiting for Putin to bring “positive change,” 10 percentage points higher than a year ago.
Through their canny, energetic use of social media and YouTube, Navalny has done an end-run around Russia's state-controlled news media, which is the main source of information for people outside of the country's main cities. Demonstrations called by Navalny this year rattled the Kremlin, not only because of their large turnouts but due to the fact they were taking place in provincial cities throughout the country.
Many of those who showed up at the Novokuznetsk rally say Putin does have support there, but nowhere near as overwhelmingly as the last election figures indicated. The real picture, they say, is distorted by widespread voting fraud.
Navalny told The Associated Press after the rally that they are encouraged by the warm reception they are seeing in Russia's regions. They say that proves support for Putin in the places that habitually give them 80 percent of the vote at the polls is “fiction and falsification.”
Navalny's activists all over Russia have been canvassing all year on the streets and going door-to-door to talk to voters, despite threats and intimidation from authorities.
“If we can hold such a big rally here, with all the pressure and intimidation, it means that we enjoy at least significant support here,” Navalny said after an hour of posing for photos with rally attendees in Novokuznetsk.
Navalny initially laughed off a question about what is going to happen if authorities — when the presidential campaign officially starts later this month — formally bar them from running.
“(The Kremlin) cannot bar me from running if such a big number of people is supporting me,” they declared.
But they later offered a glimpse into their plans.
“If they don't register me, people together with me will not recognize this election and we will boycott this election,” they said.
A low presidential turnout is something the Kremlin is very wary about.
Fighting apathy is one of the most common theories behind the surprise presidential bid of socialite-turned-journalist Ksenia Sobchak. The 36-year-old candidate has been mildly critical of Putin but faces none of the obstacles that Navalny's supporters do. Many Russians think their efforts are designed to boost interest in an otherwise bland presidential campaign — a claim that Sobchak absolutely denies.
But Navalny probably does not even need to call for a boycott to bring the turnout even lower, because many residents of the Kemerovo region have already given up on the presidential vote.
Sergei Maslyukov, 40, watched their daughter slide off a mammoth mound of snow on Novokuznetsk's main square. They did not go to Navalny's rally Saturday and has not heard much about the popular activist.  They are also disappointed in Putin but sees no viable alternative to the Russian leader.
“The promises they made ... they did not make good on them,” Maslyukov said. “What promises? Do you think average pay in Russia correlates to the prices? I'm not going to vote for anyone.”

A portrait of actor Johnny Depp made of tobacco, by artist Abdelrahman al-Habrouk, burns in Alexanria, Egypt August 10, 2017.
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (Reuters) - In a small studio littered with empty cigarette packets in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, Abdelrahman al-Habrouk sits hunched over a sheet of paper making portraits with tobacco.
The cigarettes fuel their art; they break them in half, painstakingly traces out monochrome images of celebrities or animals with the fine flakes of tobacco, then sprinkles their creations with gunpowder and sets them on fire.

The resulting scorch-marks on the white paper form the portrait.
Habrouk, now 23, started using unusual materials to make images a couple of years ago, experimenting with coffee, salt and sand before settling on the tobacco technique because it is more durable.
"The idea is that I'm trying to make the art live longer," they told Reuters.
"I wanted to make something good out of something that is considered harmful," they added.

LISBON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court dismissed on Wednesday an appeal by Goldman Sachs for compensation from Portugal's Novo Banco over a $835 million loan to Novo Banco's bankrupt predecessor, Banco Espirito Santo (BES), which was carved up by the state in 2014.
The decision, announced by the court on its website, sets a precedent that could help Portugal fend off other lawsuits involving major bondholders in BES, such as Pimco and Blackrock, which have challenged similar decisions by the Portuguese central bank in 2015 not to transfer liabilities to Novo Banco.
The loan arranged by Goldman Sachs was extended to BES by Luxembourg-based vehicle Oak Finance in 2014, shortly before the bank went bankrupt under the weight of the debts of its founding family, and Goldman has sought compensation from Novo Banco, which took over the healthy operations of BES.
Britain's Supreme Court said it unanimously rejected the appeal, even though the original loan agreement was governed by English law. Novo Banco declined to comment.
After the collapse of BES in August 2014, Portugal's central bank transferred some assets and liabilities to Novo Banco, which took over BES operations after an injection of about 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of public funds. It was acquired last year by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star.
In December 2014, the central bank specified the Goldman Sachs loan was not eligible for the transfer and had never been transferred, to which Goldman objected.
The court said it understood "that an English court must treat the Oak liability as never having been transferred to Novo Banco. It was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause."
It added there were ongoing administrative law proceedings in Portugal challenging the December 2014 decision, which have not yet been resolved.
A range of other lawsuits by bondholders in BES and Novo Banco also challenge a central bank decision at the end of 2015 to transfer more than 2 billion euros of bonds from the rescued Novo Bank back to BES, which is being liquidated.
London-based hedge fund Winterbrook Capital said last week it considered several notes issued by Novo Banco to be in default as a result of the resolution measures taken by Portugal's central bank in 2014 and 2015.
Despite the warning, Novo Banco placed 400 million euros worth of subordinated debt notes just two days later on June 29, its first issue since the rescue, to strong investor demand.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said yesterday that it was better understood every day that the volatility in the exchange rates does not have any tremendous economic reason and depth, adding that the country will fight against it by protecting the local currency.
Speaking at the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AK Party) group meeting, party leader and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan elaborated on the recent volatility in the exchange rates.
Erdoğan noted that the 7.4 percent growth rate achieved last year in the economy is the best response to those making negative assessments regarding Turkey.
Referring to the fact that they will easily overcome all problems threatening the economy, especially interest rates and inflation, in the new period, without compromising budget discipline and the reform agenda, the president said the positive reaction of the markets and the business world to the decision of the snap elections to be held on June 24 indicates that this process is the trigger for opportunities, not of the risks, in the economy.
"As a country that has already realized six of the 10 largest projects in the world, investing is indispensable for us. We will continue to invest," Erdoğan said.Recalling that by the end of this year they will open the Istanbul New Airport and realize the Kanal Istanbul as a giant project, they said they will also take the steps to pass the Three-Level Grand Istanbul Tunnel Project for the Bosporus.
"Meanwhile, on March 18, we laid the foundations of the mutual abutments of that magnificent bridge in Çanakkale, and it is currently in progress. Of course, all of these are steps based on the logic of build-operate-transfer," Erdoğan noted.
Erdoğan stated that they will continue to move toward economic policies and investments that will have positive impacts on the daily life of the 81 million citizens in Turkey's 81 provinces, adding that when the election documents are prepared, all of these will be shared with the nation in detail.

Uganda Receives Shs90 Billion in Refugee Support
The government of Uganda has received Shs90 billion from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to address the refugee crisis currently in the country.
The minister for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees, Hillary Onek said that Uganda receives at least 4,000 South Sudan refugees daily.
Minister Onek made the comments as the US government committed $25million (approximately 90 billion shillings) through UNHCR. The function took place on Tuesday at the office of prime minister in Kampala.
As of 1st February this year, the number of refugees in the country was at slightly more than 1 million making Uganda one of the countries with the highest refugee populations in the world.
At the function, Onek thanked the Ugandan community for allowing these refuses to settle on the limited land that Uganda has.
With conflicts in neighbouring countries such as South Sudan still persisting, refugees continue to stream into the country.
The US ambassador to Uganda Deborah Malac said the funds will help reduce the refuge burden to the country.
In a metro city, the average family spends ten percent of their home's value on interiors. For most, it translates to anywhere between ten to twelve lakh rupees. If you were to spend that kind of money without seeing the final product, how comfortable will you feel? When you don't even buy a t-shirt without trying, the thought itself makes you uncomfortable, right? But that's exactly how interiors were sold in the past. When, not very long ago, 3D renders became more accessible, the experience improved. Now, with augmented reality making inroads, the buying experience is bound get even better. But the experience of virtual reality is in a different league altogether. It is the next big thing. But how soon can you expect to see your interiors in virtual reality? Perhaps, very soon.
Virtual reality (VR), put in simple terms, is a digitally created, simulated environment that feels real. To experience virtual reality, you need to strap on a VR-supporting headset, such as HTC Vive, and that will transport you to a new, virtual world. Originally the prerogative of the gaming industry, virtual reality has now found its application in a wider ecosystem. In many countries, people are now being taught high-risk skills in a virtual setup — a good example is the training for operating heavy machinery. Construction is another industry where virtual reality is making its mark as the new-age visualization tool, saving architects and builders a lot of money and time. Several companies are even developing VR capabilities to train surgeons! All this comes as no surprise because wherever the cost of making a mistake is high, having an-almost-real thing before the real thing can do wonders.
The same holds true for interiors. The term dream home, while clichéd, could not be closer to reality. Homes, and by extension interiors, are not just a monetary but an emotional investment. We would settle for nothing but perfection and hence, in a perfect world, going wrong is not an option for interior designers. This makes a case for VR as a tool to communicate design. Without any technical know-how, a customer can understand the proposed design for their home by walking into each room virtually. If you don't like something, you can ask your designer to change things now—before they become real and cost time and money. For interiors, I see VR as no-strings-attached reality. Commit to it and sign the dotted line only once you're sure. Sweet deal, isn't it? Then why hasn't it happened already? The answer lies in how VR content is created and the ecosystem as a whole. But before we even get there, let's address the elephant in the room.
But first, Augmented Reality
Augmented reality or AR is sometimes confused with virtual reality, even though technically they're different. And so are their virtues and limitations. With AR, a 3D object is digitally placed on top of our real world. Remember the wildly popular mobile game Pokémon Go? On your phone screen, with your phone camera active, you could see a digital Pokémon in your real environment. Earlier, in 2014, IKEA launched an AR app far ahead of its time. It allowed consumers to digitally place products from the IKEA catalog in their home, simply by snapping a picture. All this when Apple and Google had not launched their ARkit and ARCore. Now, it's comparatively easier for brands to develop mobile apps that support AR. This is the perfect example of how developing an ecosystem leads to a technology being furthered and an increase in its acceptance. With VR, the ecosystem itself is comparatively nascent.
Moreover, since AR works on mobile and, in contrast, VR requires a special device, the former's accessibility is far greater.
How virtual reality works?
Virtual reality today can be experienced in two formats. The first one is a 360 image and it is supported on devices that work in conjunction with your phone, think Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, and the like. Open a pre-rendered 360 images on your phone, place your phone in the headset before wearing it and then you can turn your head around to experience a room/scene. The vantage point is pre-configured, but you would be able to experience the full 360 view.
In contrast, with devices that work in conjunction with computers, such as HTC Vive, the VR experience is far more immersive. For this VR demo, you first require some empty space. Motion sensors are then placed at the edge of this space. The headset is connected to a powerful computer capable of rendering your virtual environment in real-time: read no pre-rendered images. When you strap the headset on, you can walk through the room or teleport yourself to different places in the demo using a controller in your hand.
While content for the former can be created using 3ds Max (a popular 3D rendering software that has been around for a while), the latter requires specialized software such as Unreal engine.
Problems with virtual reality today
VR industry, due to its nascency, is in a state of flux. The whole ecosystem that supports VR—from software where the content is created to devices where the content is consumed, is growing and improving and is not nearly perfect. As a direct result, the cost of creating VR demos—especially the second format, and the time taken to do the same can be prohibitive for many. One can either hire a VR studio—which is equipped with trained VR artists, software, machinery, etc.—to produce content or develop those capabilities in-house. The latter, obviously, is a costly and time-consuming affair. For exactly this reason, VR demos are still more common in commercial projects where the ticket size is far greater than a residential project. If VR is to go mainstream, it has to evolve to become more accessible.
Next, there is a considerable difference in the quality of visuals between the two VR formats described above. Real-time rendering in very high quality is something that is yet to be fully cracked. And high quality, needless to say, is very important for interiors. In fact, if the quality is low, there are more chances that the user will experience VR sickness (it is similar to motion sickness, in terms of symptoms).
Thirdly, at least for now, you need a specialized workforce to create VR demos. Initiatives like Vive Studios (in association with Unreal) and even a few online decor companies in India, including us, are trying to simplify the creation of VR demos, so much so that the designers can do it themselves. Vive studios are enabling interior designers to design in a virtual environment using a controller to add products, apply textures, create and scale walls and other features. The lighting and rendering to make the quality “acceptable” for a consumer is done separately. Designers are also enabled to convert their 2D/3D designs into shareable VR demos at the click of a button. These initiatives are worth pursuing because only when creating VR demos will be as easy as creating AR content with a mobile app, will the popularity of VR soar.
What's up for grabs for interior designers?
If interior designers can create spaces in virtual reality or quickly and economically convert their 2D/ 3D designs into VR format, visualizing complex spaces and taking both functional and aesthetic decisions becomes a lot easier. Spotting discrepancies early on saves rework. Next, communicating through VR ensures that both the designer and homeowner are on the same page, which improves customer satisfaction greatly. Moreover, it inspires a lot of trust and confidence in the mind of the homeowners. In fact, think about how showcasing your portfolio in VR will transform the experience for a potential client. Moreover, virtual reality makes a case for designing from anywhere—want a designer in New York to work on your apartment in Mumbai? It should now be possible to communicate without any misunderstandings! That's good news for both designers and homeowners.
A virtual-first future
A couple of years ago, virtual reality content may have only stood a chance to cater to a select few. But today, the potential to go mainstream, especially in the field of interior design, is greater than ever. To understand the potential, you only need to notice something that we use everyday. Facebook 360 was launched in 2016, and they recorded a million people using the Gear VR in just a month. Today, for most brands, in all sectors, 360 photos is the most engaging form of content. The trend holds true even with the rising popularity of 4D and 6D cinema. The average person expects more—both in terms of quality of content and experience — in 2018 when compared to a few years ago. Immersive experiences are the norm and not the exception anymore. Flat pictures are passé. The pace at which the average user today is accepting new technology is commendable. This points to a future where virtual content and all other immersive experiences will be the only way to stay relevant and deliver the experience that your customers have come to expect.

Devin Price was born well after the time period covered in Motown The Musical.
But the ensemble cast member from Lansing, an Oakland University theater graduate, feels well qualified to be part of the show.
I grew up with that music, Prince, 25, says by phone from Virginia. I remember going on vacation with my grandparents, listening to (Motown) on satellite radio and I found myself singing along to all the songs. And when my grandparents wanted to go to a Commodores concert, I ended up going, too.
So when I heard about auditions and went through the process, I knew the music inside and out.

Based on Gordys 1994 memoir To Be Loved: The Music, The Magic, The Memories of Motown, Motown The Musical was, like so many of the famed Detroit record labels hits, a smash from the time it opened on Broadway during spring 2013. Starting with the labels launch in 1958 to the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today and Forever special in 1983 and packed full of iconic hits, it was nominated for four Tony Awards and ran on Broadway through January of 2015, with a return engagement last July.
As part of the ensemble, Price gets to portray a number of Motown legends, including the Temptations Eddie Kendricks, members of the Commodores and the Contours and Junior Walker  though, Price acknowledges, they do not play saxophone himself.
I tried it once, in fifth grade, they recall. I wasnt very good at it, so I quit and went to choir and concentrated on singing.
During their time at Oakland, Price appeared in Spring Awakening, Sweet Charity, The Life and Carrie: The Musical.
When I first auditioned for the program I did my piece and they sat me down and talked and asked what I was into, what were my other hobbies  they made me feel like they wanted me there, Price says. It really was a great program.
Price moved to New York shortly after graduating in 2015 and took some regional theater roles before getting the Motown part. It happened fast but it didnt seem fast, they say with a laugh. Being part of the show, meanwhile, has given them more insight into both the music and the business of Motown  as well as a chance to meet Gordy and Motown artists such as Smokey Robinson and Mary Wilson.
Berry is still very hands-on with this, Price notes. He still sends notes. Sometimes people get emails from him. We had brunch with him. We definitely know Berry Gordy. Price has never received an email himself, but they remember that, When (Gordy) signed my book on our last day in Los Angeles they told me Junior Walker was one of their favorites. That was pretty cool.
Price is contracted with Motown through late August, after which they plan to take some dance and voice classes and get ready to audition for the next thing. But they cherish the opportunity to be part of Motown, and Motowns continuing history.
Being able to perform this music every night, Im never tired of it, Price says. I never go to work thinking, I dont want to do these songs. these songs are so great. And its so great to be doing the show right now, bringing some joy across American  no matter how we feel, to spread the joy thats in this music.

German police on Wednesday raided the apartments of four imams suspected of conducting espionage on behalf of the Turkish government against followers of U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of organizing a failed coup last July.
The raids, in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, could further strain relations between the two NATO allies, which need each other to tackle issues ranging from militant Islamist attacks to Europe's migrant crisis.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (GBA) said in a statement that the imams had acted on an order issued on Sept. 20 last year by the Turkey-based Diyanet religious authority which said the Gulen movement was behind the putsch attempt.
German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the four imams were members of Ditib, Germany's largest association of mosques which brings imams from Turkey to serve the community of some three million people with a Turkish background who live here.
"It is very clear that the influence of the Turkish state on Ditib is big. The association must plausibly disengage itself from Ankara," Maas said in a statement.
Last month the GBA launched an investigation into Turkish intelligence operations on German soil after a lawmaker filed a criminal complaint. Austria is also investigating whether Turkey has been operating an informer network targeting Gulen followers on its soil, via its embassy in Vienna.
Turkey has accused Germany of harboring militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and far-leftists of the DHKP-C, which has carried out attacks in Turkey. German officials reject the accusation.
The GBA said Wednesday's searches were aimed at finding more evidence to link the suspects to espionage activities.
"The suspects are suspected of having collected information about members of the so-called Gulen movement and passed it on to the general consulate in Cologne," the GBA said.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdoğan accuses Gulen of masterminding the abortive coup, in which at least 240 people were killed, and wants the United States to extradite him. Gulen denies any involvement in the coup attempt.
Since July Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people over suspected ties to Gulen in a wide-ranging crackdown criticized by Germany and other European Union nations.
In honor of Independence Day, NASA released a photo of sparkling stars that the space agency compared to a "burst of celestial fireworks."
"Like a July 4 fireworks display, a young, glittering collection of stars resembles an aerial burst," NASA said in a press release about the photo, which is actually a combination of two images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009.
The cluster of stars is surrounded by clouds of interstellar gas and dust — the raw materials for the creation of new stars, NASA said.
The nebula, located 20,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Carina, contains a central cluster of huge, hot stars, called NGC 3603, the space agency said.
"Appearing colorful and serene, this environment is anything but," NASA said. "Ultraviolet radiation and violent stellar winds have blown out an enormous cavity in the gas and dust enveloping the cluster."
Most of the stars in the cluster were "born" around the same time but have different colors, temperatures, sizes and mass, NASA said. The cluster includes stars at various stages of their lives, giving scientists a chance to perform detailed analysis of stellar life cycles.
"NGC 3603 also contains some of the most massive stars known," NASA said. "These huge stars live fast and die young, burning through their hydrogen fuel quickly and ultimately ending their lives in supernova explosions."
Star clusters give scientists important clues to help them understand the origin of massive stars, the space agency said.
"Astronomers also use massive clusters to study the distant starbursts that occur when galaxies collide, igniting a flurry of star formation," NASA said.
The relative closeness of NGC 3603 to Earth "makes it an excellent lab for studying such distant and momentous events," NASA said.

As maple syrup production season in New Brunswick comes to a close, producers in the province say the unusual winter and spring conditions has caused some problems.
READ MORE: Warm weather has N.B. maple producers in a hurry to get trees tapped
Bonnie Knowlton Trites of Trites Family Sugarbush, a family sugarshack in Moncton, says this was the worst season she's seen at their family business in the last 20 years.
“The season was almost non-existent because we didn't get the right temperatures, -7 at night and +7 in the daytime are perfect temperatures, we didn't reach those levels at all,” Knowlton Trites said.
Trites said that Sugarbush has 1,600 trees on their lot and it takes 10 trees to produce one gallon of maple syrup, which means they should've been able to make 160 gallons. This year, they said they produced 20 gallons.
Other producers in the southern parts of the province aren't fairing much better.
David Briggs of Briggs Maples said he'll get half of what they produced last year
“We have a little bit left from last year, where we had good crop. But this year we're gonna have to buy more from other producers here in the province,” they said.
Odds are they wont be the only one. According to to the Maple Syrup Producers Association of New Brunswick, producers on the southeast side of the province were reporting a 25 per cent yield compared to last year as the season got too warm, too quickly.
Meanwhile, producers in the northern part of the province are having a much better season.
While it's too early to say how good this year's yield will be, every indication – including past history – shows that it will be a good one, which is good news for Knowlton Trites, as they will still be able to find enough product to satisfy their client base.

Sims Bark will buy a 125,000-square-foot industrial building on approximately 65 acres near Corbin. Company owners plan to begin renovating the facility later this year. The project includes the purchase and setup of equipment for materials processing and bagging.
“Sims Bark is excited about expanding our operations in Kentucky,” said Mark Sanders, chief financial officer with Sims Bark. “We are committed to the local community and look forward to creating jobs for the area, while also meeting the growing demand for our quality bagged mulch and soil products. We appreciate the support shown by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and economic development officials we have worked with to make this project a reality.”
Bruce Carpenter, executive director of the Corbin Economic Development Agency, commended the company for locating in the region.
“On behalf of the Corbin Economic Development Agency, we would like to congratulate and welcome Sims Bark Company to our community. It has been a pleasure to work with company representatives during this process,” Carpenter said. “We appreciate their investment and job creation in our region and look forward to their future success.”
Carpenter said the facility will be operating on part of the former General Shale Brick Company in Woodbine.
“I've been working with company officials on this since 2016.”
Founded in 1974, Sims Bark is family owned. It operates two manufacturing facilities in Alabama and one each in Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina. The company processes raw materials, such as bark from sawmills, for use in mulch and soil. Sims Bark distributes throughout the Southeast U.S. and produces more than 150,000 bags of product daily.
Customers include Wal-Mart, Lowe's, The Home Depot and independent chains such as Ace Hardware and Fred's.
Senate President Robert Stivers, of Manchester, thanked the company and the state for working to make the project a reality.
“I am excited to welcome Sims Bark and its new manufacturing facility to Whitley County. The addition of 21 jobs and a $3.8 million investment will be a great boost for the local economy,” Sen. Stivers said. I appreciate everyone at Sims Bark and all those in the Bevin administration for their efforts in securing this project in Southeastern Kentucky.”
Rep. Regina Bunch, of Williamsburg, said the arrival of Sims Bark brings additional momentum to region's business climate.
“This is fantastic news for Whitley County, as a reputable company like Sims Bark has chosen Southeastern Kentucky as the place to create jobs and do business in our Commonwealth,” Rep. Bunch said. “The pro-business direction that our state is moving in is having a direct impact on our economy, increasing much-needed manufacturing jobs and new opportunities for our workers.”
Whitley County Judge-Executive Pat White noted the company's strong reputation within its industry.
“I am pleased that Sims Bark has chosen Whitley County as a location for their company. Sims Bark has produced a quality product for more than four decades,” Judge-Executive White said. “I'm excited about the possibility of good paying jobs for our citizens and that one of our industrial locations will be repurposed by this company. I look forward to working with Sims Bark in the years to come.”
To encourage the investment and job growth in the community, the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority (KEDFA) in May preliminarily approved the company for tax incentives up to $300,000 through the Kentucky Business Investment program. The performance-based incentive allows a company to keep a portion of its investment over the agreement term through corporate income tax credits and wage assessments by meeting job and investment targets.
In addition, Sims Bark can receive resources from the Kentucky Skills Network. Through the Kentucky Skills Network, companies can receive no-cost recruitment and job placement services, reduced-cost customized training and job training incentives. In fiscal year 2016, the Kentucky Skills Network provided training for nearly 95,000 Kentuckians and 5,000 companies from a variety of industry sectors.

Coronation Street viewers were shocked when a boy pestered Amy Barlow to "go upstairs" with them this evening.
The 13-year-old lied to their parents about going to the cinema and ended up going to a house party with a pal instead.
They appeared to have stolen their mum's crimson lipstick as they sat next to their friend Jessica who was texting boys nearby.

Meanwhile, their parents Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlow were in a panic after they failed to turn up at the agreed meeting place at 6pm.
Later, Amy ended up talking to a couple of boys, one of whom offered them a drink which they declined.
When they revealed that they had forgotten their bus pass to head home, the boy with ginger hair offered to give them some money or walk them home.
They were then ribbed by their friend, who then went away.

"Sorry about that," the boy told Amy, "but they left us to it though."
Asking Amy why they hadn't been replying to their texts, they said that they lost their phone.
"So you do like me?" they asked before leaning in for a kiss. They then added: "I could walk you back if you like - or we could go upstairs... what do you reckon?"
They thankfully decided not to take them up on their offer while their dad Steve and mum Tracy burst in on the party and saw them hugging the boy, who was pestering them to go upstairs.
Awkward!

GUELPH — A practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, accused last year of sexually assaulting several patients, now faces 12 new charges.
The Guelph Police Service says Sherman Lai, who also performed acupuncture, lived and practised in Guelph, but patients who lived “in the Greater Toronto Area and beyond” were referred to him.
They were charged with one count of sexual assault in October 2017. Then, between November 2017 and April 2018, the 58-year-old was charged with 16 more counts of sexual assault, two counts of assault with a weapon, two counts of possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, and two counts of uttering death threats.
Police say Lai was charged on Tuesday with one additional count of sexual assault, six more counts of assault, one more count of assault with a weapon, three counts of uttering threats, and one count of forcible confinement.
Police are asking anyone with information to call 519-824-1212 ext. 7518 or Crime Stoppers.
Facebook shares plunged on Monday following revelations that a firm working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign harvested data on 50 million users, as analysts warned the social media giant's business model could be at risk.Calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British communications firm hired by Trump's 2016 campaign."This is a major breach that must be investigated. It's clear these platforms can't police themselves," Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Twitter.Expressing "serious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of Americans was misused in order to influence voters," Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter.In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage.Vera Jourova, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, called the revelations "horrifying, if confirmed," and vowed to address their concerns while travelling to the United States this week.In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer following what appears to be a giant data breach, carried out in an attempt to influence voters' choices at the ballot box."We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent," Collins said in a statement."Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee."On Wall Street, Facebook shares skidded 7.7 per cent in midday trade amid concerns about pressure for new regulations that could hurt its business model.Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the revelations highlight "systemic problems at Facebook," but that they won't immediately impact Facebook revenues.Still they said "risks are now enhanced" because of the potential for regulations on how Facebook uses data for advertising and monitoring users.According to a joint investigation by The New York Times and Britain's Observer, Cambridge Analytica was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends.Cambridge Analytica said it was in touch with Facebook while denying any misuse of data.Facebook on Friday suspended the firm, but pushed back against the claim of a major breach, suggesting misused data was limited to a far smaller group of users.Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, said the disclosures will increase pressure to regulate Facebook and other social media firms."Self-regulation is not working," Grygiel said."I'm wondering how bad this needs to get before our regulators step in and hold these companies accountable."Grygiel said the breach stems from "thin" regulations that allowed Facebook and its partners to exploit data without oversight."They grew because of this," they said. "This was not a mistake."Daniel Kreiss, a professor of media and communications at the University of North Carolina, said Facebook failed to live up to its responsibilities in handling targeted political ads as it expanded."The fact that Facebook seems to make no distinction between selling sneakers and selling a presidential platform is a deep problem," Kreiss said.Some analysts suggested the breach posed an existential crisis for Facebook because of how it gathers and uses data on its two billion members.David Carroll, a media professor at the New School's Parsons School of Design, said Facebook and others will soon be forced to live with new privacy rules such as those set to take effect in the European Union."Facebook and Google will have to ask users a lot more permission to track them," Carroll said. "Most people are going to say no, so I think it's going to have a huge impact on these companies."Carroll has filed a legal action in Britain calling on Cambridge Analytica to disclose what data was gathered and used on him."If I can get them to disclose my data or my personality score, it indicates every other American has the right to the same thing," they said.

NEW YORK – Dick Clark Productions is hitting back against Mariah Carey's claim it sabotaged their live performance on its “New Year's Rockin' Eve” special.
Carey's disaster during the annual New Year's Eve special in Times Square made international headlines: The superstar vocally stumbled through their short set, failing to sing for most of it despite a pre-recorded track of their songs playing in the background.

Carey was visibly upset during the performance and afterward tweeted “(expletive) happens.” Them representative Nicole Perna blamed technical difficulties, and in an interview with Billboard they said Dick Clark Productions hampered Carey's performance.
“She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously,” Perna told Billboard. “A shame that production set them up to fail.”
Perna said Carey's earpiece wasn't working and they flagged the issue to the production team but was told it would be OK when they got on stage.
“However, that was not the case, and they were again told that their earpiece was not working,” Perna said. “Instead of endeavouring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.”

In a statement released on Sunday, the production company called such claims “absurd.”
“As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists,” it said. “To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.”
It said that in “very rare instances” there are technical errors that can occur with live television. It said an initial investigation, however, indicated it had no involvement in the challenges associated with Carey's performance.
“We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge their tremendous accomplishments in the industry,” it said.
A person familiar with the production of the show who asked for anonymity to speak publicly about the incident said all of the other performers, including Gloria Estefan, rehearsed onsite for their performances and Carey was there but had a stand-in for their rehearsal, atypical for the show's performers. The person said all of the monitors were working and no technical problems were found.
Perna later disputed the claim that Carey did not rehearse.
“Mariah did in fact rehearse at 3:00 p.m., Perna said in an email to The Associated Press on Monday. “She went through vocals and their team ran through sound. All was well at rehearsal. They were prompt for rehearsal and their performance.”
Ironically, Carey was Dick Clark Productions' first live performer for the broadcast in 2005, when it went off without any such problems.
Considering the fact that he's under a week old, nobody knows much about the new royal baby yet. Their name hasn't been announced, and while they looked adorable in their mother's arms, it's not clear what color eyes or hair they have (maybe he's a redhead like Uncle Harry!). One thing's for sure: Their big brother and sister definitely looked super excited to meet their little bro. But will sibling rivalry eventually set in? Perhaps the stars can answer this question. How well George and Charlotte get along with the royal baby based on their zodiac signs?
The new baby was born on Monday April 23 at 11:01 a.m. at St. Mary's Hospital in London, which makes them a Taurus. (Charlotte is also a Taurus; George is a Cancer.) That might not seem like much to go on, but those details (as well as the corresponding facts for the births of George and Charlotte) are all international astrologer and life coach Linda Joyce needs to predict the likely dynamics of their future relationships — as well as the little one's probable personality. Just because he's the baby of the family doesn't mean he'll allow themselves to get lost in the shuffle, for example.
"This child is not going to take second place to anyone," Joyce tells Romper, particularly when it comes to George. "He will defiantly take over."
George is no pushover himself, Joyce says, with powerful Scorpio as their rising sign and four planets in stubborn Cancer. Still, their little brother has quite a lot going for him. In fact, the newborn will eventually be "stronger" than George, says Joyce.
"The new prince is very focused, incredibly independent and they will love to be in control," says Joyce, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, they clarify. "He will want to help, make a difference and have their siblings look up to him," they say.
This could be especially true when it comes to Charlotte. As Joyce says, "the new prince will be totally enamored with their sister."
"They both have Cancer rising and they are both Taurus. There is an immediate comfort zone with that. They understand each other and get along from their first glance."
Because the new baby's moon in Leo is conjunct with Charlotte's Jupiter, according to Joyce, they will be "a supportive and protective older sister" (almost a "surrogate mother") and their little brother will adore all the attention. "They truly love each other," says Joyce.
The new addition to the royal family will certainly take after their camera-friendly siblings in one department: Charisma. The baby has two planets, Mercury and Uranus, in Aries, and their Sun is in Taurus, which is a "very charismatic combination," Joyce says.
"It's someone who wants to be independent before they are ready to be," they add (so the toddler years should be interesting!). And they won't give up easily, either. A Pluto conjunction in Capricorn means "when they get something in their bonnet it's going to stay there," says Joyce. As with most traits, of course, that's a bit of a double-edged sword: Persistence is a valuable quality, while the tendency to hold a grudge is not (especially if that grudge is against, say, your brother George).
Overall, happily, the longterm forecast for this family is positive.
"In short, they will all get along," says Joyce.
"There will be some competition between the boys for first place. But that's normal. And they will deal with it in a proper and loving way."
Sounds like William and Kate have the heavens in their favor on this one!

The Colorado Avalanche have played host to some of the best hockey players in the league. During their run of multiple championships, and even beyond, the Avalanche have frequently had a combination of skills that made them one of the most exciting teams to watch. From top to bottom, the Avs lines have always provided fans with great hockey. Here are the top lines in Avalanche history, in no particular order.
Gabriel Landeskog – Nathan MacKinnon – Matt Duchene
Dubbed “The 9 Line,” this combination was thrown together during the 2015-16 season to try and get some scoring going, and they did not disappoint. During the time this line was together, it was the hottest line in the NHL and was the only line that did any scoring during that stretch. Though Patrick Roy was adamant that they wouldn't split the line up, it didn't stay together for the long haul.
While this line was together, Matt Duchene set a franchise record for goals in the month of November where they scored 11 times. It was a line that had a ton of skill and speed that could take over games. While the line was very productive, it also highlighted exactly how much the Avs lacked depth at the time. This line definitely didn't have the staying power of some of the best lines in team history, but it was one of the most dynamic.
Shjon Podein – Stephane Yelle – Eric Messier
This is one of the most underrated lines in the history of the Avalanche. Stephane Yelle was a part of two championships in Colorado and was a defensive stalwart for both teams. Eric Messier was an excellent utility player that frequently swapped between defense and checking forward roles, depending on what the team needed at the time. Shjon Podein was a long-time Flyer that the Avs acquired in a trade for Keith Jones.
While this line wasn't one of the more exciting lines to watch, they are still one of the best. Their job was to shut down the opposing team and play the hard minutes. Defense may have been their primary function, but this line was also capable of possessing the puck in the offensive zone, even chipping in a bit of offense. In fact, this line was responsible for one of the biggest goals of the 2001 Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Ville Nieminen – Chris Drury – Dan Hinote
Another line from the 2001 Stanley Cup Championship team, this one featured prominently in the playoffs. This line was the absolute epitome of “hard to play against.” All three players were fast skaters, tenacious on the forecheck, could play physically and quickly transition turnovers into scoring chances.
This line was an excellent change-of-pace line for the Avalanche, who usually sent this trio out as their third line. First teams would have to deal with Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg (until their spleen was taken out), only to see this group come at you. Nieminen and Hinote were the bangers, and Drury would usually reap the benefits with their speed and skill. Go back and watch these guys, they were exciting.
Alex Tanguay – Joe Sakic – Milan Hejduk
The “JAM Line” is still one of the best lines ever to come together on the ice in Denver. Joe Sakic is one of the best all-around players in NHL history, Alex Tanguay could stick-handle in a phone booth and Milan Hejduk had one of the best scoring touches of any player in the league. Put them all together at the same time and you have sheer dominance. During their time together, Joe Sakic tallied one of their two 50-goal seasons and was named league MVP. Simply put, you couldn't stop this line…you could only hope to contain them.
Valeri Kamensky – Peter Forsberg – Claude Lemieux
Back to the early days of the Avs, this group absolutely dominated. Claude Lemieux was acquired just before the season began after winning the Conn Smythe with the New Jersey Devils the year before. They were one of the acquisitions that took the Avalanche from being a good team to a championships team. Peter Forsberg's greatness was just beginning to show and Valeri Kamensky is one of the most underrated scorers to ever play in Colorado.
To give you a picture of exactly how good this line was, during the 1995-96 season, all three of these players scored 30 goals. They combined for 107 goals, 165 assists, and 272 points. From a sheer production standpoint, this may have been the most dominant line in Avalanche history.
Scott Young – Joe Sakic – Adam Deadmarsh
Not quite as dominant from a point production view, but still one of the best to play in Denver. This trio was another excellent combination of skills that made a complete line that gave opponents fits. Scott Young had speed and a wicked shot, Adam Deadmarsh brought grit and a net-front presence impossible to ignore and Joe Sakic was Joe Sakic.
Super Joe notched their first 50-goal season while playing with these two on their wings and went on to win the Conn Smythe Trophy after scoring 18 playoff goals. This line produced very well, but most of it was on Sakic's back.
Alex Tanguay – Peter Forsberg – Milan Hejduk
This line rivals only the previous Forsberg line in skill and dominance. Tanguay and Hejduk have the unique distinction of being the wingers for both Avalanche players to win the Hart Memorial Trophy, first aiding Sakic's MVP. In the 2002-03 season, this line combined for 105 goals, 166 assists and 271 points. Considering that this was right in the middle of the “dead puck” era, this accomplishment is astonishing.
This line earned a lot of hardware at the end of the season. Forsberg came home with the Hart and Art Ross Trophies as league MVP and scoring champion. Hejduk also won the Rocket Richard Trophy with the only 50-goal season of their career. It is hard to argue against this being the greatest line in the history of the Colorado Avalanche.

The number of international visitors to the United States has dropped for the first time since 2009, as did their spending, the US Department of Commerce said Friday.In 2016, 75.6 million international travellers ventured stateside, a two percent drop from the previous year. Their spending also fell by one percent to $244.7 billion.The figures account for people journeying to the US for business, medical, education and leisure reasons.Travel and tourism however remained the largest services export out of the US, making up 33 percent of services exports and 11 percent overall.According to the department, preliminary data in 2017 has shown a rise in the number of visitors.Both US visitations and spending from China ($33 billion), Mexico ($20.2 billion), India ($13.6 billion) and South Korea ($8.6 billion) increased, but declined in other top markets.Canada sends the most travellers to the US, though overall visitors from there have declined more than six percent annually for three straight years.The US does maintain a surplus of $84 billion when it comes to tourism spending -- meaning foreign tourists in the US spend more than American tourists abroad.The US tourism industry accounts for 2.7 percent of GDP and 7.6 million jobs, according to Commerce Department statistics.
VICTORIA—British Columbia's attorney general is recommending that voters be asked two questions in a referendum this fall to determine whether they want to switch to proportional representation to elect members of the legislature. David Eby is suggesting to cabinet that voters should first be asked if they would want to switch from the current first-past-the-post system.

They would then be given three options for proportional representation and be asked to rank them based on which they preferred. If a majority supported making the switch, the option with the highest number of votes would be implemented. The campaign period starts July 1, with voting by mail-in ballot running from Oct. 22 to Nov. 30.
Article Continued Below
The questions were released today by Eby after a period of public consultation that included more than 180,000 visits to a government website. The province's minority NDP government and the Greens have supported proportional representation that determines the number of seats each party gets in the legislature based on its percentage of the popular vote. Two previous referendums on proportional representation have failed in B.C. Last year, Premier John Horgan said the province's current system is unfair because in the last five B.C. elections, only one political party formed a government after receiving more than 50 per cent of the votes. In the other elections, parties with less than 50 per cent of the popular vote were able to form a government. Last year's election saw the Liberals and NDP each receive slightly more than 40 per cent of the vote. But the New Democrats eventually formed a minority government with the support of the Greens, who won three seats and took almost 17 per cent of the popular vote. The government has said that if a new way to elect members is approved, it will introduce legislation to implement it in time for the next fixed-date election in 2021.

WILKES-BARRE TWP. — As a member of the Utica Comets, defenseman Andrey Pedan considered the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins one of the toughest teams to play against.
He's excited to see what it's like to play for the Penguins this season.
Pedan, acquired by Pittsburgh earlier this week in the Derrick Pouliot trade, is the newest addition of the 31 players listed on tonight's opening roster for the Penguins. They face the Charlotte Checkers at 7:05 p.m.
A large 6-foot-5 blue liner, the Kaunas, Lithuania, native has played in 97 AHL games over the last two seasons, recording 10 goals and 35 points.
While their height makes them easily noticeable on the ice, Pedan is hoping their 200-foot game is what merits the attention with the Penguins.
“I have a big shot, so I'll use it when there's a time and place,” Pedan said Friday at Mohegan Sun Arena, “but I'm just trying to work on being solid on defense.”
Penguins head coach Clark Donatelli said Pedan will fit in with the team because they are tough and a good skater.
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton is noticeably bigger on the blue line this season, with five defensemen checking in at 6-foot-3 or taller. But, as Donatelli points out, they all have the shooting and skating ability that can allow the team to flourish.
“We'll take big with skill any day,” Donatelli said.
Pedan also doesn't anticipate a long adjustment period with their new teammates, adding they played with fellow Penguins defenseman Frank Corrado in Utica. So, they can focus on maximizing their opportunity to showcase themselves for a new organization.
“You have to work on the little details and try to get better every day,” Pedan said. “I'm not looking ahead; I'm just taking it day by day and working on the little things.”
Captain's crew
It was a foregone conclusion that Tom Kostopoulos would be the Penguins captain for opening night, but Donatelli said Friday that defenseman Chris Summers and forward Garrett Wilson will be the assistant captains against Charlotte.
“Garrett is a leader on and off the ice, the way they work,” Donatelli said. “He's the heart and soul of our team, so that's an easy (choice).
“Chris, he's new to our organization, be he's come in and they show leadership qualities.”
Donatelli also said that, although those two will wear the “A” on their sweaters tonight, they think many of the team's new additions will be a key piece of its overall leadership going forward.
Injury report
Forward Colin Smith and defensemen Jeff Taylor and Jarred Tinordi are all “week to week,” according to Donatelli.
Forward Troy Josephs was on the ice during practice Friday, but is still out indefinitely.

One person was killed in a collision involving a car and a semi-truck in the intersection of two Alberta highways Tuesday afternoon.
Three Hills RCMP were called to Highway 583 and Highway 21 at around 2:30 p.m.
A car with two people inside was struck on the driver's side by a truck, RCMP said.
The 95-year-old driver of the car was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead. A 96-year-old woman, who was a passenger in the car, was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries.
The driver of the semi-truck was not hurt, RCMP said.
“Preliminary investigation suggests the passenger car had entered into the intersection from Highway 583 after the stop sign to make a left (northbound) turn onto Highway 21 when it was struck by the southbound semi,” police said in a news release.
A collision reconstructionist has been on scene for several hours as RCMP investigate.
The intersection of Highway 21 and Highway 583 was still closed to traffic at 7 p.m. Tuesday. RCMP did not give a timeline for when the road might be open again.
Three Hills is located about 130 kilometres northeast of Calgary.
Though invented in the very earliest part of the 20th century, the vinyl record picked up sales momentum midcentury and began a journey that not only created superstars but widened music's popularity in general. New formats have been conceived over the decades, of course, and all have superseded the record's dominance at one time or another, but for collectors and music fans who enjoy their music on a visceral level, there will never be an equal to the bewitching quality of a flat, round platter of wax, made all the more special by the cardboard cover or sleeve that protects it. Vinyl is magic and, most people agree, it is here to stay.
The first Record Store Day in 2008 was meant to be both a celebration and a reminder of the delicious, independently owned record shop; the neighborhood joint that stimulates the senses as you can walk in, where you hear music over the speakers that might inspire you, have a chat with the clerks to learn about new stuff and then flip through the 12-inch square covers, getting the opportunity to touch and feel the smooth, glossy cardboard packaging and wonder about the artist and music repped inside.
Now a yearly event every April, Record Store Day, which marked its 10th year on Saturday, April 21, has found its groove, so to speak, and has become known for unique limited releases by record companies, which in turn bring out competitive collectors and vinyl "nerds," leading to long lines outside of every record store in town. But even if you're not a vinyl obsessive, creative in-store signings and special performances make the day fun for all.

HOLMDEL – Work is expected to begin soon on the township's new, bigger and better library, to be housed at the Bell Works professional complex.
The modest but busy library, a branch of the Monmouth County Library system, is currently located in the basement of Town Hall. The new address will be on the second floor of the former Bell Labs building, a 2-million-square-foot structure located two miles south of Town Hall on Crawfords Corner Road that is the centerpiece of an ambitious mixed redevelopment plan.
The size of the library will increase sevenfold, from 2,500 to 17,000 square feet, said township Mayor Eric Hinds. “It's really important to us,” Hinds said. “It's a home run for the town.”
Judith Tolchin, director of the county library system, said the new location is a great opportunity for library patrons. “I think it's a wonderful move for Holmdel residents and the rest of the county.”
The township recently signed an agreement with Bell Works developer, Somerset Development of Lakewood, in which the library gets a perpetual free lease, Mayor Hinds said. Bell Works would cover $1 million of the estimated $1.5 million to $1.6 million in renovations to accommodate the library in the professional office space, with the township responsible for the rest, Hinds said.
Work on the new library is to begin in the first quarter of 2017 and could be completed within nine to 12 months, Hinds said.
The new library was designed with input from the town, library staff and library patrons, and will include space for books and computers, along with meeting room space, Tolchin said. The county library system will provide the staffing and materials for the library.
“It was really a collaborative partnership,” Tolchin said. They expect the staff to increase from four to perhaps six staff members.
The 450-acre site with its massive glass-walled complex and iconic water tower shaped like a transistor and designed by architect Eero Saarinen, sat empty for a decade after Bell Labs, AT&T and Alcatel Lucent abandoned it.
Now, under Somerset Development's revitalization plan, the building is being envisioned as a health center, a hotel, retail space, and office space for tech companies, among many other things.
It was recently announced that applicant tracking software maker iCIMS of Matawan has signed on to be a flagship tenant with 600 employees; several other tech companies have also taken space. Jersey Central Power and Light Company has also announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Red Bank to Bell Works with 200 employees next summer.
Part of the redevelopment plan is new housing on the property. Toll Brothers is planning 225 units of luxury housing on parts of the 478-acre parcel.

A forbidden affair that ruined the lives of a man and a young girl is explored by both parties once again in the first trailer for Una. Rooney Mara stars as the title character, with Ben Mendelsohn starring as Ray, the man they ran away with 15 years ago, before their affair came to a sudden end. As you can see in this trailer, the re-emergence of Una threatens to destroy the new life that Ray has built for themselves in the years following the affair.
Una, based on David Harrower's play 'Blackbird', follows a young woman's journey to reclaim their past. Fifteen years earlier, Una (Rooney Mara) ran away with an older man, Ray (Ben Mendelsohn), a crime for which they were arrested and imprisoned. When they come across a photo of them in a trade magazine, Una tracks them down and turns up at their workplace. Them abrupt arrival threatens to destroy Ray's new life and derail their stability. Unspoken secrets and buried memories surface as Una and Ray sift through the wreckage of the past.
Their confrontation raises unanswered questions and unresolved longings. It will shake them both to the core. Una gazes into the heart of a devastating form of love and asks if redemption is possible. The trailer, which comes courtesy of Shaw Theatres, reveals that it will be released in Singapore theaters January 19, but a domestic release date has not been given quite yet. Ben Mendelsohn's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story co-star Riz Ahmed leads the supporting cast that also includes Tobias Menzeies and Tara Fitzgerald.
Una marks the feature film directorial debut of Benedict Andrews, a critically acclaimed Australian stage director. Their theatrical productions have included the sell-out London production of A Streetcar Named Desire, starring Gillian Anderson and Ben Foster and Sydney Theatre Company's touring production of The Maids at the Lincoln Center Festival, New York- which starred Cate Blanchett and Isabelle Huppert. Una also boasts a strong line-up of talent behind the camera, with director of photography Thimios Bakatakis (The Lobster, Dogtooth) production designer Fiona Crombie (Snowtown, Macbeth), hair and make-up designer Jan Sewell (Everest, X-Men: First Class), costume designer Steven Noble (BAFTA-nominated for The Theory of Everything) and award- winning editor Nick Fenton (Life, Submarine).
From film and theatre impresario Jean Doumanian and Patrick Daly for Jean Doumanian Productions (August: Osage County, The Book of Mormon) Una is also produced by Maya Amsellem for WestEnd Films. Executive producers are Kevin Loader (Wuthering Heights, Hyde Park On the Hudson), Sharon Harel and Eve Schoukroun of WestEnd Films and David Kosse and Sam Lavender for Film4. Celia Duval is Co-Producer, with financial backing provided by Film4 and Creative Scotland. Take a look at the new trailer for Una below.
Panaji: Amid the raging debate over cow slaughter and consumption of beef, a Sadhvi attending a meet of various Hindu outfits has said those who consider eating beef as a status symbol should be hanged.
The remarks made by Sadhvi Saraswati on Wednesday evening triggered a sharp reaction from the Congress, which said their speech would spark communal hatred and asked the BJP-led government in Goa to lodge an FIR against them
"I appeal to the Government of India that those people who consider eating meat of their own mother as a status symbol should be hanged," Sadhvi Saraswati from Madhya Pradesh said.
"They (those who eat beef) should be brought before the public and hanged, then only people will know that it is our duty to protect 'gau mata'," they said while commenting on beef consumption during the inauguration of All India Hindu Convention at Ramnathi village.
Sadhvi Saraswati, president of Sanatan Dharma Prachar Seva Samiti of Chhindwada in MP, also wanted the Hindus to keep arms in their homes to protect themselves.
"If we do not stock arms, we will be destroyed in future," they said.
"Today Bharat is under attack from all directions. Efforts are being made to separate Kashmir from Bharat and also stop the Amarnath pilgrimage. Bharatmata-Gaumata are being censured," they said.
Slamming the demand by some political parties to ban the outfits calling for the creation of the "Hindu rashtra", they said they should realise that no power in the country can prevent Hindus from establishing the "Hindu Nation".
They said "there is no such thing as saffron terrorism," adding that "saffron means dedicated life for the nation and dharma."
Nearly 130 Hindu organisations from 21 states and countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal are attending the four-day convention, its organisers said.
Reacting to the speeches made at the meet, All India Congress Committee secretary Girish Chodankar questioned the Manohar Parrikar-led state government's silence over them.
"The statements provoking communal hatred are made during the convention. The state government has become a party to the entire programme by maintaining silence and allowing it to continue," Chodankar alleged.
They also questioned Goa Forward Party leader Vijai Sardesai's silence on the issue.
Sardesai, whose party is now an ally of the ruling BJP, had in the past hit out at the VHP's claim that it would ban beef in the state. They had said that those who were trying to create communal disharmony would be dealt with strongly, Chodankar said
"Why is they (Sardesai) silent over Sadhvi's statement promoting violence?" Chodankar asked.
They said the government should have taken suo moto cognisance of the sadhvi's comments and filed an FIR against them for 'hate speech'.
This move from the Liberals to reform the jury selection process is incredibly disturbing. The current method where both sides are able to remove a set amount of jurors for no stated reason allows for a fairer jury without politics influencing the selection process. With the new system, lawyers will have to justify selections and be subject to whatever political winds are blowing at the time. The idea that this new reform will give a fairer shake to First Nations is itself racist, since when did the Liberals care what colour your skin was?

ISLAMABAD, : Former Interior Minister and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz's (PMLN) leader Chaudhry Nisar stated that they always opined not to adopt policy of confrontation with the country's top court.
Nisar made these articulations during an interview with a private television channel.
“Nawaz Sharif must follow the legal path over their concerns pertaining to court's verdict. Sharif has been brainwashed that party would garner sympathy if they are jailed. Contrary to that, opposite will happen”, asserted Nisar.
“The verdict of the apex court must be implemented in its true letter and spirit. If the verdict of Supreme Court is wrong, the onus lies with us as we took the case (Panama Papers case) to the court. I was the only one in the party who opposed the strategy of taking the case to apex court”, claimed Nisar.
While responding to a question on freedom of speech within the ruling party, Nisar claimed that act of practicing difference of opinion had been curbed completely.
On a question pertaining to former president of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf, Nisar revealed that federal government had allowed Musharraf to leave the country as a result of written agreement. They said, “The legal counsel of Pervez Musharraf had assured SC of their return after medical treatment. So the onus lies with apex court, not us (PMLN)”.
Nisar termed Raza Rabbani as the best Senate chairperson in Pakistan's history and deplored appointment of Saleem Mandviwalla as Senate deputy chairperson.
On questions about Imran Khan, Nisar stated that they had informed former premier Nawaz Sharif that they couldn't unleash personal criticism on PTI chairperson. They dismissed rumors about having contacts with Khan.
They reiterated that they wouldn't be part of any decision aimed at awarding the highest position of the party to Maryam Nawaz.

Remission is a young hardcore band from Santiago, Chile who sing in English and whose passionate, emotive, melodic take on the genre recalls prime Dag Nasty. At least for some of us, there are few things as satisfying as hearing someone just nailing that sort of chest-thumping midtempo trudge-churn, and Remission own it.
Earlier this year, we posted the band's excellent one-off song “Voices,” and now the band has announced that they'll release their full-length Enemy Of Silence next month. “Voices” will be on the album, and so will the absolutely massive riff-monster “Left Wondering,” which you can hear below.

To the Editor:
Last week, I traveled from Piqua to the Statehouse in Columbus to represent cancer patients and survivors. I called on our state lawmakers to make quality of life for cancer patients a priority. I was honored to be joined by many fellow American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network volunteers from across the state.
I made the trip because as a future health care professional, cancer is a very pressing topic. I also just recently lost a great-uncle to severe cancer and have other friends that are battling this disease as well. People that are battling this should know that they are not alone and they need people on their side to help fight this.
I met with Sen. Gardner, and made it clear that Ohio's legislature needs to put politics aside on behalf of all those Ohioans who will hear the words, “You have cancer” this year, and all those who will ultimately die from the disease. I asked our lawmakers to support palliative care legislation that will improve patient quality of life and asked them to join the Ohio Cancer Caucus. Cancer must be a priority at the statehouse.
Along with my fellow volunteers, I let our lawmakers know that volunteers across the state are counting on them to take a stand against cancer by supporting what works to prevent it. It's time to end this devastating disease as we know it.

Witnesses: Racing drivers slam into family's SUV
A serious traffic crash with injuries closed a portion of Lee Boulevard in Lehigh Acres. The crash happened around Curtis Avenue North on Friday night.
According to witnesses at the scene, drivers racing at high speeds slammed into a family's SUV, sending them to the hospital.
The exact circumstances leading up to the crash and the extent of any injuries involved are unclear at this time.
Count on WINK News to provide more information as it becomes available.
At last season's trade deadline, the Kootenay Ice made an enormous move when they sent their two leading scorers Zak Zborosky and Matt Alfaro to the Lethbridge Hurricanes in a bid to improve their future.
While the Ice finished in last place in the WHL in 2016-17, it was evident immediately that they had received a pair of gems in exchange for their 20-year-old duo. Colton Kroeker and Brett Davis ended last year on the team's top line, playing the best hockey of their careers.
This season, they expanded their roles even further and were named the Ice's co-MVPs for 2017-18. Presented with the ‘Apollo Ristorante Most Valuable Player Award' prior to the team's last game on Saturday night, Kroeker said that it was a special honour.

“Davis and I were good friends coming from Lethbridge [and] we played on the same team for awhile [so] it was pretty cool getting MVP with him,” said Kroeker, who played their final WHL season this year. “Obviously, there were a couple other guys that also deserved it, but I feel fortunate to have gotten it with him.”
Kroeker finished tied with fellow overager Alec Baer for the Kootenay scoring lead, putting up 61 points in 68 games, while Davis was third with 58 points in 72 games. While Kroeker had the better first half of the season and was rewarded by being named team captain in November, Davis came alive in the second half.
According to Ice head coach James Patrick, the decision for the MVP award was actually a tough call between four players: Kroeker, Davis, Baer and defenceman Martin Bodak.
“Baer scored more big goals for us [than anyone] and Bodak [was] a really good all-around player,” Patrick said. “He was the one defenceman on our team who could go toe to toe with any player in the league, [including] the elite players.
“But when it came down to Kroeker and Davis [there was so little separation]. They were guys who were on the top two lines [and] they played against the other teams' best lines. They were our best offensive guys and our best defensive guys.”
Operating for the majority of the year with interchangeable top two forward lines — one centred by Kroeker and the other by Davis — both players also had key roles on the power play and were elite penalty killers.
Kroeker was a frequent source of praise from Patrick throughout the season, who said that the 20-year-old Surrey, B.C. native showed their leadership early and often.
“When I came here in training camp, we had very few centers… basically [just] Peyton Krebs and Brett Davis,” the coach said. “[Since] Peyton was 16 years old, we were adamant about not throwing them to the wolves and overplaying him.
“Someone else had to play center for us. I asked Colton [if they played centre] and they said, ‘no, but I'll give it a try.' After the first exhibition game, I was shocked. I said, ‘You can play center. You're a smart player.' Within two weeks, they were right up to speed… the first two months, they played against every best line and a lot of nights outplayed a lot of guys who are going to be in the NHL next year.”
The coach explained that this willingness to do whatever they could to help the team earned them the captaincy after defenceman Cale Fleury was traded, and also made them an MVP.
While Davis struggled early in the year, after having been drafted into the NHL by the Dallas Stars over the summer (sixth round, 163rd overall), their coach had high praise for how they ended their campaign.
“Brett's second half was one of the best in the whole league,” Patrick said. “I think their play put them up with the top players.”
While Baer and Bodak did not receive MVP honours, both were rewarded with major trophies. Baer was given the ‘Rod Hunter Ltd. Players Award', the best player of the season as voted on by their fellow players, while Bodak was named the ‘Dixon Service Centre Top Defenceman'.

As the team's second round selection in the 2017 WHL Import Draft, Bodak played 59 games this season and registered 31 points. They also captained Slovakia at the World Junior Hockey Championship in Buffalo, New York where they led their country to an upset round robin win over the United States and had three goals in five games.
Other Ice award winners included Peyton Krebs, who was named the ‘Denham Ford Rookie of the Year' after putting up a WHL first-year student best 54 points in 67 games and Cam Hausinger, who won the ‘Skyway Distributors Most Improved Player' award.

Hausinger had 43 points in 70 games this season, a year after only having 15 splits between the Saskatoon Blades and Red Deer Rebels. Developing great chemistry with Davis, Hausinger went from being an expendable player to a key part of Kootenay's future.
“At the start of the year, we thought [Hausinger] would be a fourth liner and they were a guy that Red Deer felt was expendable because they had a lot of right wingers,” Patrick said. “I sat them out a game [early in the year] because I didn't know what type of player they were [but] within about two months of the season, they became a top-six forward.

“Whether it spurred them on or whether it was a mistake on my part, I use them as an example of a guy who I'm looking to have a big year next year for us and be a much better player.”
Colton Veloso, meanwhile, was named the ‘BDO Canada LLP Most Underrated Player' in their 20-year-old season, in which they had 47 points in 71 games. A former member of the Portland Winterhawks, their goal, assist and point totals were all single-season career highs.

Finally, 19-year-old defenceman Dallas Hines was honoured with the ‘EKCC Community Relations Award' for their dedication, time and effort toward the community.
According to the team, Hines always showed tremendous enthusiasm when afforded the opportunity to take part in community initiatives and took part in ‘Reading with the Ice', the CHCA Fashion Show and Silent Auction, minor hockey practices and other community programs.

At the penultimate home game, Krebs was also named the ‘Kootenay Ice Fan Club Player of the Year', while rookie Sebastian Streu was named the team's ‘Scholastic Player of the Year'.
The Ice finished the 2017-18 season in 19th place in the WHL, four spots above last place. After finishing at the bottom of the league in their previous two seasons, Kootenay had 21 more points than in 2016-17.
Their final game of the season against the Red Deer Rebels was a 5-0 shutout victory in front of their home crowd.
TNT has renewed its hit dramas, Animal Kingdom and Claws – both of which showed season over season growth.
TNT Renews Juggernaut Dramas Animal Kingdom and Claws Both Series Defy Industry Trends With Consistent Season-Over-Season Growth
Claw Ranks Among the Top 5 Cable Dramas This Year; Animal Kingdom in the Top 10
Season Two of Claws Airs Sundays at 9 p.m. (ET/PT)
Season Three of Animal Kingdom Airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (ET/PT)
July 2, 2018 – TNT has renewed two of its core, powerful dramas – Animal Kingdom and Claws – following their impressive summer premieres. The two-night, two-telecast season three launch of Animal Kingdom combined for 4.3M Total Viewers and 2.0M 18-49 viewers so far, the premiere airing alone generating 978K 18-49 in Live +7. The season two premiere of Claws drew 1.3MM 18-49 in Live +7, +38% higher than last year's series debut. Season two is now tracking +9% ahead of season one, ranks among the top 5 cable dramas this year, and is currently posting the largest YOY growth among all returning cable dramas.
Both shows defy industry trends where the typical returning series is down double-digits. Animal Kingdom and Claws join TNT's The Alienist among the top 10 cable dramas in 2018.
Animal Kingdom is seeing an incredible increase in digital views, with its season premiere up more than 4X YOY. On social, Animal Kingdom sparked more than one million engagements in its first week, up +18% YOY. Digital views for Claws's season premiere were more than 2X higher YOY and season two has already generated more than 700K social engagements in its first week alone, with +75% growth on Twitter and +58% growth on Facebook.
Season three of Animal Kingdom, a bold, adrenaline-fueled series, stars Emmy® and Tony® winner Ellen Barkin as the matriarch of the Cody crime family, along with Shawn Hatosy, Ben Robson, Jake Weary, Finn Cole, Molly Gordon, Carolina Guerra and special guest star and Emmy® nominee Denis Leary. In last season's shocking conclusion, Baz (Scott Speedman) was shot while on their way to Mexico after framing Smurf (Barkin) for murder. Their fate was revealed in the season three premiere, which opens with Smurf still in jail and their grandson J (Cole) in charge of the family business. The Cody men find themselves increasingly divided as they fight for both control and their independence, but have to come together when outside threats emerge. Denis Leary made their series debut as Billy, Deran's (Weary) drifter dad who comes back to make amends, but may have other motives.
Claw follows the rise of five treacherous manicurists working at the Nail Artisans of Manatee County salon, where there is a lot more going on than silk wraps and pedicures. The hit dramedy currently stars Primetime Emmy® nominee and Daytime Emmy® winner Niecy Nash, Primetime Emmy® winner Carrie Preston, Judy Reyes, Karrueche Tran, Jenn Lyon, Jack Kesy, Kevin Rankin, Jason Antoon, Jimmy Jean-Louis, Suleka Mathew, Screen Actors Guild Award® winner Harold Perrineau and Screen Actors Guild Award® nominee Dean Norris. Last season saw Desna (Nash) trade one crime boss for another as the Russian mob took control of both the pain clinic and the salon. With new management comes new problems for the women to handle.
Animal Kingdom is produced by John Wells Productions in association with Warner Horizon Scripted Television. Emmy® winner John Wells serves as executive producer on the series. Animal Kingdom was developed for television by Jonathan Lisco and inspired by the award-winning Australian feature film written & directed by David Michôd and produced by Liz Watts, who also serve as executive producers on the series.
Claws is executive-produced by Rashida Jones (Angie Tribeca, Toy Story 4, Celeste and Jesse Forever, A to Z,), Will McCormack (Toy Story 4, Celeste and Jesse Forever, A to Z), Janine Sherman Barrois (ER, Criminal Minds), who also serves as showrunner, and Eliot Laurence (Welcome to Me), who created the series. Claws is produced for TNT by Jones and McCormack's Le Train Train, in association with Warner Horizon Scripted Television and Turner's Studio T.

Using Cloud Based Software to Create an Internal Business Structure
Every business has an operational structure. How it works, who reports to whom, how the administrative tasks that come with being in business get done. Many businesses use a very traditional structure for this. They have an IT department, an accounting department, HR, Customer Service, etc. But as technology advances, new ways to organize come along. One enhancement with that potential for change is cloud computing.
If you aren't familiar with the cloud, here's the quick summary. Instead of purchasing software and installing it on computers at your businesses, you contract with vendors who supply similar functionality as the software you would have purchased, but you access it remotely. That's a vast oversimplification, but with that you can understand that instead of having to wait a year for a new version, which you might have to purchase, you automatically get updated features for your cloud software as the vendor finishes them. You might get twenty new features in a year, all available instantly as they are completed, with no extra effort, one every two weeks or so.
How does this impact your business' internal structure? Let's take a look.
Reduction of Administrative Staff
One way you can change from that traditional business model is by reducing or eliminating unnecessary staff and departments. Any large company needs a Human Resources or Personnel department to manage hiring, training, and all the other HR related activities. By using a cloud-based tool which automates things like payroll, time tracking, and employee data retention, you can reduce that staff to the minimum needed.
Instead of a payroll department, you might only need one or two people. Your accounting team can be reduced by using customized tools in the cloud to balance your books. There may even be functions you can eliminate completely, just as switchboard operators were no longer needed as phone systems became more advanced.
Savings on IT Infrastructure And Staff
A great deal of time and effort is spent on creating and maintaining the infrastructure needed to support your computer systems, programs, and networks. A tech company may have a huge IT staff with millions of dollars of equipment, but even businesses outside the tech industry need to maintain highly complicated systems. Moving to the cloud allows you to move some of that maintenance task to a vendor, like GoDaddy for your WordPress hosting.
Instead of hiring a database administrator or team to build and monitor a database system, your cloud provider has done this for you. The cloud software is supported by the vendor, you call them for help with configuring software, or helping you find the best wordpress caching plugins. You can reduce your IT footprint enough to support your basic network needs through your cloud provider. That leaves you more resources and time to concentrate on your core competencies.
Coordination Between Departments
Using a CRM allows you to record all relevant information for your customers, and share it between the departments who need it. Marketing can use aggregate data like business intelligence and design campaigns to target new prospects. Sales can follow up on the leads generated using information gathered and stored in the CRM software.
Once the leads are converted, the customer service team has access to all the information gathered by sales and marketing, plus any they gather in the course of supporting the client. Research and development can use that data to choose what new directions to go. New products, new services, new features, whatever the data says customers want.
Location Independence
You can distribute your staff over a wider area, allowing work from home or mobile offices, since your tools can all be accessed in the cloud just as if they were in an office. This can give your business competitive advantages by using local sales staff in various offices across the country or around the world.
Your customer services can be distributed throughout many time zones, giving you a true 24 hours a day support center. Expert staff who don't wish to relocate can still be hired and allowed to work through the cloud.
Communication Enhancements
Managing people is usually about communication. With cloud-based VoIP technology, contacting staff around the world is no longer a barrier. Video conferencing through the cloud can make staff meetings or training sessions face to face again. Data management solutions can allow easy sharing of documents. Even sharing of computer desktops. Many companies offer automated phone systems which integrate work phones and mobile devices.
With the vast number of tools available through the cloud and the many ways they can transform traditional company structures, it is now possible to trim away much of the effort spent on administrative tasks and focus more on your central business goals.
Altman, Jones inducted into US Astronaut Hall of Fame
Lloyd Campbell
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — On April 21, 2018, the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame membership swelled to a total of 97 when Space Shuttle astronauts Thomas Jones and Scott Altman were inducted into the hall. This was the 17th induction of astronauts from the Space Shuttle era.
In a ceremony appropriately set beneath the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex, the two men were honored for their accomplishments while at NASA. More than 15 other members of the hall were in attendance including Apollo 7's Lunar Module Pilot Walt Cunningham, STS-1 Pilot Robert Crippen, and other Space Shuttle veterans such as Story Musgrave, Ellen Ochoa, Jerry Ross, and Charlie Bolden.
Each year, inductees are selected by a committee of astronauts already in the Hall of Fame, along with former NASA officials, flight directors, historians and journalists. To be eligible, an astronaut must have made their or their first flight at least 17 years before the induction. Candidates must be a U.S. citizen and a NASA-trained commander, pilot or mission specialist who has orbited Earth at least once.
Thomas Jones
Jones started their career in the U.S. Air Force having attended the Air Force Academy prior to piloting B-52 bombers. During the induction ceremony, they told a humorous story during about their academy days when they met two Apollo-era legends.
“I met Dave Scott and Wally Schirra when they visited the Air Force Academy,” Jones said. “And after the talk—they gave a fascinating talk together—I ran down to the front of the room to meet these two guys, Scott and Schirra. I went right up to Wally Schirra and shook their hand and I said ‘thank you Captain Scott.' And that probably explains why my first two NASA applications were rejected.”
Jones did finally get accepted into NASA's astronaut corps and started their career with the agency in 1990. Their first Space Shuttle flight came in April 1994 when they spent 11 days in orbit for the STS-59 mission on board Endeavour. Their primary responsibility was to run the science operations on the “night shift” during the first flight of the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL-1).
With the SRL-2 flight scheduled just six months later, they returned to space for another 11-day mission in October of 1994, once again on board the Endeavour, where they served as the payload commander.
It was just over two years before they flew again when they launched on Nov. 19, 1996, aboard the Columbia for mission STS-80. Jones used the orbiter's robotic arm to release the Wake Shield Facility and later re-capture it from orbit.
Two six-hour space walks had been planned for the mission, however Jones and their spacewalking partner, Tamara Jernigan, never got outside the orbiter as the crew could not open outer airlock hatch. The mission also set a Shuttle endurance record with the mission lasting 17 day, 15 hours, 53 minutes and 18 seconds.
For their final flight, Jones flew aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-98 mission in February of 2001. The almost-13-day mission to the International Space Station had a primary goal to deliver and install the U.S. Destiny laboratory module to the orbiting outpost. During the construction flight, Jones did finally get outside the spacecraft to perform three spacewalks to help install the module. Combined, their three outings inside a spacesuit lasted just under 20 hours.
After NASA, Jones authored four space and aviation books and engineered intelligence-gathering systems for the CIA.  They are currently a senior research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, focusing on the future direction of human space exploration, uses of asteroid and space resources, and planetary defense.
Scott Altman
Altman served in the United States Navy before joining NASA. They were commissioned as an ensign in 1981 and earned their pilots wings 14 months later. They have flown multiple types of aircraft including the F-14A and F-14D Tomcats. They have logged over 7000 flight hours in over 40 types of aircraft. While their NAVY and NASA careers are among the most visible points of their life, they have probably been seen more by more people, albeit unknowingly, in the 1986 movie “Top Gun” where they flew aerial acrobatic flights.
Altman's first Shuttle flight was aboard the Columbia where they served as the pilot for STS-90. The mission flew the Neurolab science experiment laboratory in it's cargo bay with experiments that studied the human the nervous system. The flight launched on April 17, 1998, and lasted for more than 15 days.
Their second and final flight as Shuttle pilot came in September of 2000 when the crew of the Space Shuttle Atlantis flew to the fledgling International Space Station and prepared it for the first permanent crew.
Their two flights as commander of the Shuttle were the STS-109 mission, once again aboard Columbia, and STS-125 mission, once again aboard Atlantis. Both were missions to retrieve and service the Hubble Space Telescope to allow it to continue functioning as NASA's eye into the cosmos. These servicing missions were some of the most high-profile and high-risk missions that the Space Shuttle program ever performed, and both missions accomplished all their goals.
Altman's career in space totaled more than 51 days over their four missions.  They are a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Navy Commendation Medal, and was the 1987 award winner for outstanding achievement in Tactical Aviation as selected by the Association of Naval Aviation. They retired from NASA in 2010 to join the ASRC Federal family of companies.
“When I was asked one time what achievement was I most proud about, I thought and reflected on my career, you know, flying on and off carriers, launching on the Shuttle, commanding a mission to Hubble and not killing it, were all great,” Altman said. “But the thing I am most proud of has been sharing my life for 33 years with my wife and raising three wonderful boys. I owe them all a debt I can never repay.”

India gave away 27,000 tickets for the opening games of the Under-17 World Cup in New Delhi on Friday in a bid to avoid the embarrassment of empty stands when Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends, an official said.Thousands of children filled the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium to boost India's first major sporting event since the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which was marked by vast open spaces in stadiums.Sales for the youth World Cup have been disappointing despite the presence of Brazil, Spain, Germany, England and other top teams.India lost their opening encounter against the United States 3-0 at the 56,000-capacity Nehru Stadium, with Modi watching the first few minutes of the game."We have given away 27,000 tickets to schools around the Delhi region and will also provide pick and drop facility. It will be embarrassing for us if the stadium looks empty," an organising committee member told AFP on condition of anonymity.School children and local fans cheered as two-time champions Ghana edged past Colombia 1-0 in the first game of the day in Delhi."It is a relief to see such a good atmosphere. One is always jittery on the first day of a tournament, but as they say, well begun is half done," said a FIFA official.The event, which runs until October 28, has been dogged by fears over India's pollution. Greenpeace issued a report that said the poor quality of air in India's cities poses a "serious health risk" to players and spectators.Twenty-four nations are competing in the event, which is being held in New Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, Kochi, Guwahati and Kolkata.Greenpeace said all six cities "share dangerous levels of air pollution" but singled out New Delhi as the venue with the highest risk."Air pollution levels during the Indian tournament could be significantly worse than during the 2008 Beijing Olympics," the report warned.India's capital will host its last game of the tournament on October 16, just before pollution levels spike around the Diwali festival, when Hindus celebrate by setting off huge amounts of fireworks.Media reports said matches were deliberately kept out of Delhi after October 16 because of pollution fears.India's Supreme Court has ordered authorities to take precautions ahead of the festival, and measures under consideration include pulling some cars off roads and closing polluting industries.World Cup organisers did not comment on the Greenpeace report.The 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi were meant to showcase India's ability to stage key events but left memories of shoddy venues, empty stadiums and massive budget overruns.
U.S. Congressional attempts to block delivery of F-35 warplanes to Turkey is another sign that lawmakers on Capitol Hill don't really know what they are doing. Indeed, they only help to fuel Turkish distrust and anger of Washington and push Turkey further toward Russia, which, unsurprisingly, makes Putin extremely happy.
Sensing the opportunity, last week Putin confronted the American discourse and backed President Erdoğan's decision to seal the S-400 deal. Then they took a step further, implying that Turkey could also buy new generation Russian stealth fighter jets instead of F-35s.
As U.S. Congress recklessly contemplates punitive actions against Turkey for its cooperation with Russia, they are ensuring that Russians are the only option for Ankara's immediate military needs.
How did we get here?
It is actually quite simple. Since 2014, American senators for various reasons blocked the sale of American weapons to Turkey, most notably even simple deliveries; for example, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) were frozen for a long time during a crucial Turkish anti-terror operations against the PKK.
At various times, Turkey has tried to acquire American weapons; in many cases, the Obama administration blamed Congress for the unsuccessful Turkish efforts.
Last year, around this time, President Erdoğan told Washington think tankers that the U.S. Congress was the main reason for their decision to purchase Russian systems instead of an American one, though one Turkey observer noted that it was also likely that the Obama administration might have been using Congress as an excuse to prevent sales they don't want to happen.
U.S. State Department officials are still hoped to convince Turkey to buy another NATO-compatible system from the United States, but that ship sailed long ago since Turkey is already scheduled to receive the Russian system next year.
A Turkish official recently told me that they find the U.S. alternative offers on this issue disingenuous because Congress is likely to block any missile defense system package offered by the Trump administration, anyway. "Are they sure that this package would get through the Senate? I'm not sure about that. This is the reason we came to this point in the first place," the Turkish official said.
Yet this doesn't end here. According to a Haaretz article, there is now an Israel initiative to prevent Turkey from obtaining a software upgrade for F-35 planes to "keep its military qualitative edge," which is ironic because Israel isn't part of the F-35 coproduction process.
While Israel is a customer for the F-35 program, Turkey has been a developmental partner since 2002. Up to 10 Turkish companies are involved in either development or production. Turkish companies are responsible for producing some parts and maintaining F-35 engine as well.This is why it is a little ironic that Israel came up with these demands. Yet it still doesn't make sense.
Turkey and Israel have never fought against each other – even in 2010 when Israeli soldiers killed nine Turkish citizens who were part of the Gaza flotilla.
I cannot really see where Israeli officials are heading with this unreasonable concern on Turkey's military capabilities. So far, the only country edging toward war with Turkey was Russia when Turkey shot down the Russian jet in 2015 for violating Turkish airspace. This is why Israeli concerns are unwarranted.
Now, due to U.S. failure to support Turkey in Syria and the congressional blockades on Turkish attempts to buy American weapons, Ankara seems more driven to Moscow than at any time in recent history.Instead of waging a vendetta against Turkish officials with punitive efforts that are very likely to backfire, American lawmakers should engineer ways to move Turkey closer into the transatlantic orbit. Otherwise, they will continue to risk rising Russian influence in a crucial NATO ally.
One, two, three. Throw it in the bin. Four, five, six. Keepin' up your chin. No, dear reader, I haven't lost my mind… yet. There are times, though, that I wonder why there's this dire need for us to kill the environment.
Unconsciously, we don't realize how big a role are we playing in deteriorating our planet. It all majorly comes from plastic. And to help the environment in some way, Pallavi Utagi took an important step.
“I was a new mother when I got introduced to baby care. Diapering was another concept that was fairly new for me. I only knew about the disposable diapers available in the market.
When I started using diapers for my son, I realized two things: not only was the plastic diaper bad for my child's skin, it was also a contribution into the never-dying dumping ground that our Earth is turning into.”
And so, Pallavi began looking for an alternative. It was difficult at first because, in India, there is only about 2-3% penetration of non-disposable diapers as compared to disposable ones. During their research, Pallavi also discovered that Indian mother preferred cloth-based traditional methods as diapers for their children.
And, that's how Superbottoms was born. They used cloth and natural materials to make sure that the soakers have a dry base for the baby.
Me: How long did it take for you to come up with your own diaper-brand Superbottoms?
Pallavi: It took me a good one year research and digging into the details to come up with my own diaper-brand.
Me: How many times can a single diaper be used?
Pallavi: About 300-400 times. Yes, the durability of the diaper is strategically designed in a way that it becomes both economical and eco-friendly. For example, when I started using it for my son, they were only three-months-old. The diaper-size fit them till the time they were potty trained. What else would a mom need?
Me: Who designs the diapers?
Pallavi: We have a team of freelance graphic designers, who are basically mom-graphic-designers on maternity leaves. So, they know the right thing to create for a child.
Me: What are the pros and cons of using these diapers?
Pallavi: The pros are many including them being baby-friendly, eco-friendly and economical. The only con is washing them.
Me: Any customer reviews that have helped you modify the design?
Pallavi: Initially, I was asked to include snaps that would keep the soakers in place. Then there were some that asked for alteration in the size. Yes, suggestions do keep coming in, and we have been trying to improve the diapers as much as possible.
Me: Do you plan to expand the diaper line?
Pallavi: We plan to introduce baby beds and wipes, too. But, we want to keep it hygiene related.
Me: What has been the contribution and support of your family?
Pallavi: I can say it, hands down, that nothing would have been possible without my family. My husband, in fact, is actively contributing to the project. Moreover, managing the business alone with a child, especially for a woman, is not easy.
Me: Of course, there was appreciation. But, that always comes with a bit of discouragement. Did anyone ever tell you to not do it because of this or that?
Pallavi: Not really. There were some who did show their concern by advising me not to quit a job and start a business because of the risk factor involved.
Me: Poop one fun fact about you.
Pallavi: I love watching silly Hindi comedy films when I'm free, for example, Andaz Apna Apna, and Welcome? In fact, one of the diaper designs is called Mogam-bum, that has Crime Master Go Go on it.
Just wondering how the children will be scared of them when they grow up if they wear their face on their butt. *wink*
Me: Do you talk poop-colors with other moms?
Pallavi: Yes, we talk consistency, color, and even frequency. When you're not a mom, all of this feels gross, but, really it plays a major role in keeping a check on your child's health.
Apart from being environment-friendly, we cannot get over how super cute these diapers are. Dear new mothers, we hope that after reading this article your choice of diapers will change. *wink*
You can buy Superbottoms, here.

Speaking on a day when the GST council is meeting in Delhi, the VP said people must understand that any transformation or reformation faces "some initial hiccups, some teething troubles".
"But at the end of the day, the PM's mantra of reform, perform and transform has a meaning," they said, adding that GST was India's most revolutionary tax reform ever.
Chelsea want Diego Costa to end their exile, return to London and prove their fitness, Press Association Sport understands.
Costa has criticised Chelsea's treatment of them this summer, saying they are "not a criminal", and said they are prepared to remain in exile for a year as they agitate for a return to Atletico Madrid.
But it is understood that Chelsea want Costa, as a player with two years remaining on their contract, to return to the club.
The Blues also expect the Brazil-born Spain striker to prove their fitness and make themselves available for selection, even though they are no longer in head coach Antonio Conte's plans.
After being granted an additional week of leave and missing the pre-season tour to Asia, Costa is still to return to London around two weeks after their anticipated arrival.
Costa, speaking at their family home in Lagarto, Brazil, said they have not reported for training as they do not want to train with the Blues' reserves, and is happy staying in Brazil and paying club fines until their future is resolved.
They told The Daily Mail: "They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that.
"I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me."
Chelsea do not have a reserve team, only age-group sides, and Costa has been given no indication that they would be expected to train with them, Press Association Sport understands.
Costa joined Chelsea from Atletico in July 2014. They have twice won the Premier League title during their three years at Stamford Bridge and scored 59 goals in 120 appearances.
The 28-year-old claims they were told they were not wanted by head coach Antonio Conte by text message in the summer and the frontman wishes to return to Atletico.
The Blues declined to respond to Costa's comments.
Chelsea and Conte have previously insisted the decision for Costa to leave this summer was made in January, with both the player and their agent, Jorge Mendes, aware.
Costa only wants to move to Atletico, who are under a transfer embargo and cannot register new players until January.
In Costa's absence, the Blues lost 3-2 to Burnley on Saturday's opening day of the Premier League season.
Val Kilmer took to their Reddit account to share a video themselves and their Doors co-stars rehearsing at L.A.'s legendary Whiskey a Go Go circa 1990. The short one-minute clip shows the actors performing The Doors' classic song "L.A. Woman" in the darkly lit Whiskey. Oliver Stone's The Doors received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the band upon its release in 1991, even the surviving band members were unhappy with the finished product. Doors members Robby Krieger, John Densmore, and Ray Manzarek were brought on as technical advisors on the movie, but claim that Oliver Stone often ignored their input in favor of their own retelling of history. One bright spot that critics and fans could agree upon was Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doors frontman Jim Morrison.
Val Kilmer originally uploaded the rehearsal footage to their YouTube account almost three years ago and shared the link today on their Val Kilmer Reddit account. In addition to sharing the video, Kilmer also replied to fan inquiries while sharing anecdotes about playing the legendary singer over 26 years ago. For instance, a fan recalls not being able to tell the difference between Kilmer and Morrison for years. Kilmer replies with this.
"It boggles me to this day to seeing people with a tattoo of me playing them and not knowing it isn't Jim. It happens more than you think."
Another fan compliments Kilmer on their accurate physical portrayal of Morrison while crediting the movie to losing their virginity. Kilmer laughs and responds with this.
"Glad I could help! Ha!! I had to work at it of course. I do sing, but singing like the Lizard King is unique experience unto itself."
The short clip definitely shows Kilmer singing Morrison's parts live, but it is unclear if the rest of the actors are actually playing their instruments during the rehearsal. Kilmer mentions that Kevin Dillon did know how to play some drums, but that they "tutored up" when they got the role. Elsewhere in the Reddit discussion Kilmer answers what a commenter should have for lunch, encourages Real Genius puns, and whether or not Alfred found chicken nuggets and sauce cups in the Batmobile.
Kilmer has said in the past that they aren't that big of a Doors fan before they took the part, but that changed by the time filming had wrapped. In fact, Kilmer got so far into their role that they apparently had to receive therapy to get out of character. Kilmer learned over 20 Doors songs in a studio and spent hours interviewing Doors producer Paul Rothchild to get into the role. By the end of production Kilmer had the cast and crew referring to them as Jim as they copied the way that they walked and talked. It has even been reported that the surviving members of the band couldn't tell the difference between recordings of Kilmer singing and Morrison's versions. I'd take that nugget of info with a grain of salt though...
Kilmer has been using social media a lot lately and it's a pretty weird experience to see them interact with their fans on Reddit or Twitter. There was much talk of Batman, Real Genius, and of course The Doors, but surprisingly nobody brought up Top Gun 2 aside for calling Kilmer the Iceman. So while we didn't learn of any Top Gun 2 news, we did learn that Kilmer takes their lunchtime selections very carefully.
Zakir Naik, the controversial Islamic preacher who has been staying abroad to evade arrest in various cases in India, on Wednesday said they would not return home till they felt "safe from unfair prosecution".Naik's statement, issued through their PRO in the city, came amid reports that they were being deported to India from Malaysia."The news of my coming to India is totally baseless and false. I have no plans to come to India till I don't feel safe from unfair prosecution," said Naik in the statement.He added that they would "surely return to my homeland" when they feel "that the government will be just and fair."Naik is facing various cases, including for hate speech and money laundering, in India and has been staying abroad to evade arrest.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had first registered a case against the 51-year-old Naik under anti-terror laws in 2016 for allegedly promoting enmity between different religious groupsThe NIA and Mumbai Police, subsequently, had also carried out searches at 10 places in Mumbai including residential premises of some of the office bearers of the foundation run by Naik.The foundation was earlier put on the restricted list by the Home Ministry for receiving funds from abroad.

ISLAMABAD, April 17 (APP): Minister for Industries and Production Ghulam
Murtaza Khan Jatoi Monday apprised the Senate that proposal was on card to set up 42 Special Economic Zone (SEZ) across the country besides nine industrial zones being established under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in all the provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Winding up discussion on a motion moved by Ayesha Raza Farooq that the
House may discuss the need for effective measures to boost industrial growth in the country, the minister said the SEZ aimed at manufacturing all those goods which now were being imported.
They said the approved nine zones would be set up one each in all
provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and FATA while two zones at Islamabad and Karachi.
Jatoi said Board of Investment was also developing a policy so that
technology could also be transferred to Pakistan in the economic zones.
They said all Pakistani labour laws would be implemented in these zones
adding that local labours would be given opportunities in these zones.
The minister said the government was taking effective measures to boost
industrial growth in the country.
They said the industrial growth has reached to 6.8 percent this year from
4.6 per cent owing to the pragmatic steps taken by the incumbent government.
Jatoi said industries have almost been exempted from power and gas load-shedding.
They said export processing zone has already started work in Karachi and
another would be established in Gwadar.
The minister said the government has also given auto policy under which
new manufacturing plants were being set up in the country which would also help attract foreign investment.
The interest rate was also reduced from 9.5 per cent to 5.7 per cent to
encourage investment in the country.
New York: A lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on Wednesday accused adult film actor Stormy Daniels' lawyer of leaking Cohen's bank records to the press, calling it a "drive-by shooting of my client's rights."
The comments by Cohen lawyer Stephen Ryan regarding Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, came during an often-heated hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan related to a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors into Cohen's business dealings.
Avenatti told Wood they did not release anything improper about Cohen, who has not been charged with a crime.
But the judge told Avenatti they would not have free rein in their courtroom "to denigrate Mr. Cohen and, I believe, potentially, deprive them of a fair trial by tainting a jury pool" should criminal charges be brought against Cohen.
Leaks could make it harder for Cohen to get a fair trial if they were charged. Legal experts have said they might choose to cooperate with prosecutors as pressure mounts.
The investigation stems in part from a referral by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.
Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion, and Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election.
At Wednesday's hearing, Wood set a June 15 deadline for Cohen's and Trump's lawyers to identify materials seized in April raids on their home, office and hotel room, which they say prosecutors cannot use by prosecutors because the materials are subject to attorney-client privilege.
Wood said a "taint team" of prosecutors not involved in the Cohen probe would make the determinations after that date.
Ryan, one of Cohen's lawyers, said in court that Avenatti acted maliciously by releasing their client's bank records and attacking Cohen in dozens of media appearances, to "paint a false narrative" about Cohen and "call attention to himself."
Avenatti has released details of payments to Cohen from a company linked to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who the United States sanctioned over suspected meddling in the election.
Avenatti's involvement has complicated the Cohen probe.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said they had a sexual encounter with Trump, and sued Cohen in March to end an agreement under which Cohen paid their $130,000 not to discuss it. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Avenatti signalled that more disclosures are forthcoming.
"We've got a whole host of information that we are going to be releasing relating to Mr. Cohen and relating to Mr. Trump, so they better buckle up," they said.
The June 15 deadline to review documents seized from Cohen was a month sooner than Cohen's lawyers had wanted.
Todd Harrison, a lawyer for Cohen, said their firm was "moving heaven and Earth" to review documents. They said they have reviewed about 1.3 million of the 3.7 million files turned over.
But the judge said taking too long was not an option.
"It's important for the court to balance the slow, deliberate needs of those asserting attorney-client privilege with the need for an investigation to go forward," Wood said.
× Expand Elizabeth Daniels of Alton holds their newest son Jackson Scott Daniels, the first 2017 baby born at Alton Memorial Hospital at 10:58 a.m. Jan. 1.
ALTON — Elizabeth Daniels and their husband, Charlie, were looking forward to the delivery of their fourth child Jan. 11.
But Jackson Scott Daniels had other ideas, arriving 10 days early to become Alton Memorial Hospital's first delivery of 2017.
Jackson arrived at 10:58 a.m. Jan. 1, delivered by Dr. Rachel Durham at Alton Memorial's Women's Health and Childbirth Center.
“The contractions started around 10:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve,” Elizabeth Daniels said. “We had some friends over, but I thought we better get here quickly. It was a false alarm then, but it was certainly worth it.”
The Daniels, who live in Alton, have two other sons — Cody, 14, and Riley 8 — plus a daughter, Haley, 13. For delivering the hospital's first baby of 2017, the Daniels family received a wagon full of gifts donated by several hospital departments.
“That was amazing,” Elizabeth said. “I saw the wagon when we got here and I thought it was just out as some type of display. After Jackson was born, they told me it was all for me. And everyone on the nursing staff has been great.”

One week before the election, Jodi Remke on Tuesday submitted their resignation as chairperson of California's state campaign watchdog agency amid turmoil as other members of its governing panel were moving to reduce their powers.
The resignation, which takes effect Friday, comes after a majority of the state Fair Political Practices Commission supported the creation of two subcommittees to provide input on key decisions that previously have been made largely by Remke, who is the only member of the panel who has a full-time role.
Remke said they are “extremely proud” of accomplishments that include a crackdown on serious campaign finance violations and making it easier for the public to get information on lobbyists and personal finances of elected officials.
A Kainai Board of Education member is getting ready for retirement. Superintendent Richard Fox is going to be leaving some big shoes to fill after a remarkable career and enormous contributions to the Blood Tribe.
Having worn many hats over their career, Fox was the Kainai High School principal, the Kainai Board of Education's deputy superintendent, and will retire from the highest position as superintendent on July 1, 2018.
“We're definitely we're going to miss their experience,” says Lionel Weasel Head, chairperson for the Kainai Board of Education.
Fox has been part of the Kainai board since its inception in 1988, previously teaching with the Cardston School Division for 10 years. They have been integral for the growth of the school district.
“Thirty years seems like a long time, but it has been a whirlwind, it's gone by quickly,” comments Fox. “The rewarding aspect is that we here on the Blood Reserve have really appreciated the opportunity of being able to have control of education for ourselves, our students, our community. And as a result I feel like I've played a role in that.”
Their contributions are felt by those around him.
“The respect, the kindness, the compassion for our students and the employees, you know it brightens your day when you're going to see him,” says Weasel Head. “There's not going to be a negative part about meeting with him.”
Fox says only 10 per cent of the teachers and the staff were First Nations people when the board was formed in 1988. Today they say the reverse is true with over 90 percent of the community involved in teaching, administration and support staff.
“As we've evolved as a school district, the children have evolved as well. The mentality of the parents and students that — let's face it — there is no opportunity out there without an education, without a Grade 12 diploma.
The Kainai Board of Education says it hopes to appoint a new superintendent before Fox's last day.
TORONTO — A “Back to the Future” reunion is set for this year's Fan Expo Canada.
Organizers say previously announced guest Michael J. Fox will be joined by fellow “Back to the Future” stars Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson.
Edmonton-born Fox starred in the “Back to the Future” franchise as time-travelling teen Marty McFly.
Fan Expo Canada will run Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.
Other guests expected include Canadian actors Evangeline Lilly and William Shatner, and American stars Jeff Goldblum and Jason Momoa.
Also in the lineup is “Deuce Bigalow” actor Rob Schneider as well as Billy Dee Williams and Peter Mayhew of “Star Wars” and several cast members from “The Princess Bride.”
Our weekly picks from Los Angeles' small-theater scene deliver stories exploring the economic exploitation of the masses (The Actors' Gang's “Captain Greedy's Carnival”), the pure power of storytelling (Sacred Fools' “Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play”) and Joseph Conrad's “Heart of Darkness” reset in Afghanistan (Son of Semele's “Ridiculous Darkness”). Plus, we get Judith Scott from TV's “Snowfall” in a twist on George Bernard Shaw's “Mrs. Warren's Profession.”
1. ‘Captain Greedy's Carnival' at the Actors' Gang
The essentials: In the center ring of this sardonic world premiere musical, a charismatic con man dupes the innocent with flashy assurances of instant wealth. The carnival sideshow setting with its traditional freakish amusements is an allegory for a rigged capitalist financial system, since “both are engineered to entertain, deceive and fleece an eager and gullible public,” according to playwright Jack Pinter.
Why this? Pinter conceived the piece in response to the Wall Street shenanigans exposed by the 2008 economic meltdown, affecting all our wallets in one way or another. The Actors' Gang has a record of originating edgy, vibrant new work, and Tim Robbins' oversight as co-founder and artistic director ensures pointed activist messaging. The original score here is by ambient composer Roger Eno, known for atmospheric film soundscapes and their collaborations with their brother, Brian.
Details: The Actors' Gang Theatre, 9070 Venice Blvd., Culver City. 8 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays; ends Nov. 11. $34.99; Thursdays pay what you can. (310) 838-4264, theactorsgang.com

2. ‘Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play' at Sacred Fools
The essentials: As refugees fleeing radioactive fallout bond over campfire reenactments of pop culture, the critical role of storytelling in the survival of humanity drives Anne Washburn's intricately constructed, seriocomic mashup of Boccaccio's “Decameron” and the Simpsons' infamous “Cape Feare” episode.
Why this? Washburn's ingenious script is profound and at times deadly serious in tracing the way an iconic pop culture narrative evolves to suit the needs of different historical eras. For the L.A. debut of what the author admits is “a beast of a play” to take on, veteran Sacred Fools director Jaime Robledo (“Stoneface,” “Watson”) and the company's first-rate design team take the audience on a journey through time and space, situating each act in a different theater of the three-stage venue. The Sacred Fools mission is affordable but thoroughly professional theater, so don't be fooled by the low ticket price.
Details: A Sacred Fools Theater Company production at the Broadwater complex, 1076 Lillian Way, Los Angeles. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays; ends Nov. 18. $15. (310) 281-8337 or www.sacredfools.org
3. ‘Ridiculous Darkness' at Son of Semele
The essentials: The U.S. premiere of German writer Wolfram Lotz's riff on “Heart of Darkness” (and its cinematic progeny, “Apocalypse Now”) resets Joseph Conrad's meditations on colonialism in an absurdist present-day Afghanistan, where logic never gets in the way of freewheeling satire. A top-secret soldiers' mission, fanatical missionaries, Somali pirates and a pessimistic parrot challenge the reductive way that Westerners view the developing world and the divide between different cultures.
Why this? For the experimentally curious, this is a prime specimen of the way contemporary German theater upends expectations. Lotz wrote the piece as a radio play and encourages unlimited transformation of it. The fearlessly fringy Son of Semele troupe's staging honors that intent with an open-mike format set in an international cafe, with five actors doubling many parts for the play's satirical take on globalization — who gets to speak, and whether anyone is actually listening when parrots squawk “The horror! The horror!”
Details: Son of Semele Theater, 3301 Beverly Blvd., L.A. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 5 p.m. Sundays; previews start Oct. 14, opens Oct. 21, ends Nov. 12. $20. www.sonofsemele.org

4. ‘Mrs. Warren's Profession' at A Noise Within
The essentials: In George Bernard Shaw's forward-looking classic, a virtuous, self-reliant young woman is horrified to discover that the absent mother who funded their education and comfortable lifestyle from afar earned their wealth the oldest-fashioned way. Gleefully intended, in Shaw's words, as a “sudden earthquake shock to the foundations of morality,” the play was written in 1893 but banned from public performance until 1925 due to the frank examination of prostitution and its underlying socio-economic causes.
Why this? Nowadays, it's hard to remember what a rigorously argued, platitude-free debate over difficult moral questions even looks like. Complementing A Noise Within's classical repertory expertise, guest director Michael Michetti (from Pasadena's modernist Boston Court theater company) slyly heightens Shaw's insight into feminist issues and social barriers by making the unrepentant brothel owner Mrs. Warren a self-made woman of color, played by Judith Scott (from TV's “Snowfall”).
Details: A Noise Within, 3352 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena. Runs in repertory; see website for schedule. Ends Nov. 18. $30-$84. (626) 356-3100 Ext 1. or www.anoisewithin.org

Last week on the 99-Seat Beat
July 1 was an interesting day for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Columbus Blue Jackets castoff defenseman Jack Johnson smiled like the Cheshire cat while being introduced to the Pittsburgh media.
Also in a surprise move, the Penguins brought back a familiar face in the form of 41-year old Matt Cullen.
These moves give general manager Jim Rutherford 13 NHL-ready forwards and six defensemen. So that's all they wrote for the offseason, right?
According to Rutherford, maybe not.
Jim Rutherford said they aren't going to close the door on the trade market and suggested there would be more trades – leaguewide – in 2-3 more weeks. This was the same man who pulled off the Brandon Sutter/Nick Bonino trade on July 28 of the 2015 offseason. — Seth Rorabaugh (@SethRorabaugh) July 1, 2018
Many in the hockey world anticipated a big Penguins trade during the draft, and again at the start of free agency, but no blockbusters as of yet. This may be the roster that coach Mike Sullivan begins the season with, and that's OK.
I have become fairly optimistic about Rutherford's additions, and the chances of this club as currently constructed. But today I'd like to take a look at some possible moves that could happen prior to the start of the 2018-19 campaign.
The Pros and Cons of Trading for Jeff Skinner
This is a well-traveled rumor that picked up steam around the draft but appears to have fizzled recently. Jeff Skinner seems to be poorly utilized in Carolina and could benefit from time with an elite centerman such as Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin.
As you can see, Skinner would be a drastic upgrade in the top-six, even over a valued winger like Carl Hagelin. Under the right circumstances, Skinner could be one of the better goal scorers in the league, but they have struggled with inconsistency. The 26-year-old has topped the 30-goal mark twice in their career and is only one year removed from scoring 37 in the 2016-17 season. Imagine if they could find consistency under Sullivan while playing with other dynamic forwards.
This sounds great, but there is a reason that the Hurricanes would be looking to trade the former first-round pick.  They are entering the final year of a contract which, according to Cap Friendly, already pays them nearly $6 million per season. If they were to come to Pittsburgh and score 40 goals, that number would skyrocket. As the hockey world witnessed with John Tavares, there are dangers with stars looking for a big payday.
A likely return coming from the Penguins in a trade could look something like Carl Hagelin, Tristan Jarry, and a high draft pick. That's a pretty steep price for what would likely be a rental player. I do like the idea of their talent in black and gold, but fans should not get too attached if they do come to the Steel City. Remember Marian Hossa?
Trading Brassard Is Still Not Out of the Question
Trading Derick Brassard is the nagging rumor that won't go away.
I offered up a question to my Twitter followers recently asking if they are comfortable with Riley Sheahan and Matt Cullen being the Penguins' bottom-six centers in the event of a Brassard deal. The resounding answer was “no.”
Common sense suggests that moving the former Senator would not be in the club's best interests, yet the chatter still persists.
The most linked team in the conversation is the Montreal Canadiens, and looking at their roster, there are few options that line up. Max Pacioretty is the first name that comes to mind, and left wing is a bit of a need for the Penguins, but unless they can work another center into the mix, it feels like robbing Peter to pay Paul.
I'm not saying a Brassard move could not happen, but the return has to be a home run. Especially considering what they gave up to get him.
Small Surprises May Be in Store
The Penguins' roster feels like it's set for the start of the season, but don't be shocked if you see some surprise moves come out of left field.
Before free agency started, Rutherford locked up youngster Daniel Sprong to a two-year contract, so they are not going anywhere. However, it would not be a surprise to see Sprong's fellow up-and-comer Zach Aston-Reese be involved in a deal for a more established player.
Another player that could potentially be moved is Olli Maatta. The Finnish defender has been through the rumor mill before, though a move isn't likely as the Penguins seem content with their blueline.
Then there is still the possibility of Anthony Duclair signing as a free agent. It would be interesting to see where they would fit, especially after the Cullen signing. But they would be a welcome addition to a bottom-six that struggled last season.
Prior to the start of free agency, Matt Gajtka from Pittsburgh Hockey Now suggested that the Penguins could be interested in Duclair and discussed how they could positively impact the club.
With Chicago, Duclair played in 23 games, recording three goals and five assists. They have been a positive possession player in relation to their team in each of four NHL seasons, boasting a plus-2.8 percent Corsi Relative. Their speed and hands would seem to fit with a Penguins team that plays aggressively, especially with left wing looking a little thin on the depth chart.
Truthfully, at this point, no trade or free-agent signing would surprise me. In recent years the Penguins have pulled off deals at all times of the season and offseason, so be prepared for any scenario. After all, Rutherford is a magician.
Just ask John Tortorella.
Until next time.

Man On The Strand: Punishment
Tyler hit the streets to hear about the worst punishment you've ever received.
I crawled out of bed Saturday morning to discover I had a flat tire, courtesy this time not of potholes, but a roadside nail. I had a meeting, but wasn't worried.
I knew George would save me, and they did. George, who owns Henley Auto Service on 11 Mile Road in Berkley, has been fixing my cars with great skill and never overcharging me for years. One of the nice things about living in a place for a long time is that you build up your own set of reliable go-to people; tailors, plumbers, etc. Many of the ones I've been happiest with are immigrants.
Donald Trump wouldn't allow George to enter our country today; they are originally from Iran, where they were an accountant for a French multinational.
When things started going to hell in 1978, they left with their wife, small son, and daughter. Getting certified as an accountant here would have taken time, and they needed to keep their family eating. They always had a mechanical aptitude and grew up fixing cars, so this was a natural.
"I thought I'd go back eventually, but when they took the hostages, I said, no way," George told me, meaning those at our embassy in Tehran back in 1979-'80.
But when I showed up, I found them in an intense mock argument with another customer, who turned out to be Israeli. "You shouldn't even be here in this country!" the customer said. "You wouldn't be, except for that idiot who let the shah of Iran come here," an action that turned Muslim fundamentalists sharply against Washington.
"That's true. Who was that guy, that president?" George said. "Yeah — do you know who it was?" said the Israeli, who appeared to notice me for the first time.
"Jimmy Carter." I said. "Yeah, Carter. What a prize," they said sourly, before one of them added softly:
"But even they were better than what we have now." Neither knew anything about my politics, but they seemed to be in a truth-telling mode.
Not everyone fits the stereotype of the angry blue-collar worker who can't wait to throw them Muslims out and bring all those good-payin' jobs back.
Those folks do indeed exist, and I have a morbid fascination about what they'll do when they find out that their hero is just a flim-flam gasbag, and the abandoned Pontiac plant isn't going to open up again.
But regardless of that, there are some good people quietly working every day to make this a better world.
Here's one little-known example, of how a bunch of Jews and one amazing Muslim woman are working with black pastors, kids, and parents to save a neighborhood.
The daily newspapers, such as they are, are filled with the latest megaproject plans of Dan Gilbert.
You can read all about bustling Midtown, and the latest hipster cafe. But you'll see damned little about the neighborhoods where most Detroiters live.
Everyone knows there are still places where the cops only like going in the daytime, and then in force.
There are lots of places where liquor and party stores are the only grocery stores most kids know.
But that's not the case in a chunk of Northwest Detroit, in the Wyoming-Meyers-Curtis area, where something called Project Healthy Community is not only feeding people, but teaching them about proper nutrition and running an afterschool program that's giving a bunch of 5- to 11-year-olds the tools they need to succeed.
The founders assured me they don't see themselves as a bunch of folks riding in from the suburbs to save the poor blacks, but a true community partnership.
If anyone is most responsible for this, it's an older Jewish physician named Melvyn Rubenfire who grew up in this neighborhood when it was bustling and multiracial, and Jews and blacks were fighting the same enemies, and were much closer than they are now.
"They had racism; anti-Semitism is what I had to deal with," Rubenfire, who was born in 1940, told me.
They ended up dealing with it pretty well; he's now an esteemed cardiologist with the University of Michigan hospitals. But when they were a kid nobody in the neighborhood, black or white, had any money to speak of.
As a child, they lived with their grandparents until their father, who joined the Marines at 32, returned from World War II and built a tiny, 750-foot house for their family. Time passed, and the Jewish community moved away. For years Rubenfire wondered about the old neighborhood, but between family and a demanding practice, "I never had time to do anything."
Then, five years ago, they and their wife Diane went to see what had become of the old Jewish Community Center, which had long since been renamed the Northwest Activities Center. They arrived and were looking around when they discovered there was a board meeting in progress, and those running it were close to concluding they would have to close the place down.
"When I told (the Northwest Activities Center CEO) that I and the folks at Temple Israel might be interested in helping, I saw a tear in their eye," Rubenfire says. "He said, 'We had talked about trying to reach out to the Jewish community, but we didn't know how.'"
Talk about the right man at the right moment. Fast-forward five years. Today the activities center, which had been in wretched shape, "looks better than it did when we were kids." Temple Israel, where Dr. Rubenfire is a member, got heavily involved — but so did the community.
The Revs. Charles Adams, father and son, of the nearby and famous Hartford Baptist Church, gave Project Healthy Community their blessing. A few months ago, they hired a part-time executive director who is neither Jewish nor African-American — but who everyone thinks is great. Amina Iqbal is a Muslim who was born and grew up Downriver, in Brownstown Township.
They have four children and wears a hijab and dresses in traditional modest fashion. They speak Urdu as fluently as they do English — and is both compassionate and intellectual, with advanced degrees in professional childhood development and global education policy.
Amina lives to reach kids; to "turn frowns upside down," they say. They help educate 10-year-old children who have 23-year-old mothers, and sees that kids who have never seen fresh fruits and vegetables get some.
When one child told them they had no interest in reading, they persuaded them it would be useful to be able to make out street signs if they wanted to get around.
"We hope to teach everyday values, including respecting ourselves and one another," they told me.
"Amina is exactly what we needed," Rubenfire told me. What they most wants is for this not to be unique, a little neighborhood island in a sea of despair.
"Our mission is to have this be a model that can be used anywhere there is a community in need," they told me.
Iqbal told me they are hoping to expand their afterschool programs slowly, adding perhaps a school a year. They had hoped to have moved into Bagley, an iconic neighborhood elementary school by now, but they are still waiting for a go-ahead from the bureaucracy at the Detroit Public Schools Community District.
There are millions who would say that Amina isn't really one of us because they wear a hijab, and Trump wouldn't have allowed my mechanic George in.
The fact is that if this nation still means anything, both Amina and George are far better Americans than our tweeter-in-chief. Someday, if there is any hope, we'll all be profoundly embarrassed at what is going on now.
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  A sexual harassment scandal that erupted in the Oklahoma House of Representatives and led to the resignation of one of its members is far from an uncommon occurrence in state legislatures.
Sex scandals have roiled at least eight other statehouses in the last few years.
But despite persistent incidents, many legislatures lack formal procedures for dealing with sexual harassment. While corporate America, colleges and government agencies have established processes for investigating complaints, state legislatures remain an often murky domain in which top leaders have broad latitude over how or whether to pursue allegations.
Some legislatures have adopted systems for reviewing and investigating complaints, but at least 10, including Oklahoma's, have none at all.

Experts say that makes legislatures an ideal environment for covering up sexual improprieties.
Kamal Haasan's political plans enter crucial phase in February: What the road ahead is like
The Chennai winter, when the weather is pleasant and the daytime temperature hovers between 23-27 degrees, is coming to an end. The spring season will start in a few days, and all eyes are on Kamal Haasan.
The actor-turned-politician has said they will announce their political party's name on 21 February at Ramanathapuram and begin a state-wide tour on the same day. Kamal was born in Paramakudi, a small town in Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu; hence they want to start their political journey from their home town.
Kamal Haasan communicates with their fans and potential electorate through their Twitter handle and their weekly column in the popular Ananda Vikatan magazine. They have made clear that they will tour Tamil Nadu in phases, beginning the journey from Ramanathapuram and then moving on to the neighbouring districts of Madurai, Dindigul and Sivagangai.
Kamal Haasan has also stated that their political tour — called "Nalai Namadhe" (Tomorrow is ours) — will not hit out at other political parties; it will be different from others. Kamal said, “Our public meetings will be an interactive session. Those who want to ask questions should register in advance. I'm not interested in just slamming the opposition and making wild allegations. We should redeem the glory of public meetings".
“At the commencement of the journey, I intend to announce the name of my political party along with the guiding principles and ideology we intend to take up. I want to challenge the status quo and existing system that has been plaguing the politics of Tamil Nadu for some time now,” they added.
In their latest column in Ananda Vikatan, the actor stressed that they are not anti –Hindu. Kamal wrote: "I'm not an enemy of Hindus. I'm nobody's enemy. I see Islam and Christianity the same way. I've accepted Gandhi, Ambedkar and Periyar as my teachers. I respect them equally. I do not want to glorify or ridicule anything. Neither am I an atheist; I would say I'm a rationalist.”
When they started out in politics, Kamal made sensational remarks about “Hindu extremism” which did not go down well with a section of the electorate, who saw them as another politician who wants to appease the minorities. Now they say their daughter Shruti Haasan and their brother were devout Hindus, so how could they be anti –Hindu?
On Friday, 2 February 2018, Haasan left for the US where they have been invited by Harvard University to give a keynote address (the event is on 10 February). The actor had earlier spoken at Harvard, in 2016, about freedom of speech. This time the topic is their current favourite — Tamil Nadu! The actor will address several problems that currently plague the state at the annual Indian Conference of the prestigious university. A statement issued by Kamal read: “The topic at Harvard is Tamil Nadu. I chose to speak on it out of sheer necessity. Our state has sunk to the lowest depth. It is affecting my dignity as a man, even more as a Tamilian.”
As the D-day approaches for their final plunge into politics, a lot of hush-hush developments are taking place on the film front for Kamal Haasan. Their Viswaroopam 2 is in the final stages of post-production, and the star is eyeing a summer 2018 release. However, financial troubles could prove to be an obstacle, as also a clearance from the Central Board of Film Certification.
Censor issues have become par for the course for Kamal's films, since he's so vociferously not on the same page as the ruling government in Tamil Nadu. And after Padmaavat, theatre owners and distributors are jittery about screening "controversial" films.
Meanwhile the sequel to one of Haasan's most successful films, Indian 2, directed by Shankar is all set to start filming by May 2018. Shankar and their cameraman Ravi Varman have been touring Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, scouting locations for the shoot. The buzz is that Lyca Productions (the producers of 2.0) will be producing this film as well.
Now the big question is, why is Kamal doing a brand-new film, after launching their political career?
A source close to actor says this film will possibly be Kamal's last, and spell out their ideology as well. The idea is that the film should release in April 2019, prior to the Lok Sabha and probably Tamil Nadu state elections. Indian 2 makes clear that Kamal Haasan has their eyes on the 2019 general elections.

VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty ImagesLady Gaga is making the most of their Coachella appearances. The “Million Reasons” singer will also be shooting scenes for their upcoming A Star Is Born to remake, along with co-star/director Bradley Cooper.
On Sunday, Warner Brothers tweeted a message inviting fans to “Be there when @ladygaga films for A #StarIsBorn on the #Coachella grounds nxt wk!used,” and a link with all the details. The singer also used Coachella's mobile app to relay the offer.
Shooting will take place Tuesday and Wednesday on the festival grounds, and participants are instructed to wear Denim and boots for the scene that will depict a country concert, according to the announcement. Attendees also are ordered to “Leave those pink Joanne hats at home” — a reference to the bright pink cowboy hat Gaga sports on their Joanne album.
Participants must be at least 18 years of age and admission to the filming costs $10, with all proceeds going to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation.
This will mark the third remake of A Star Is Born, which originally came out in 1937. The first remake, in 1954, starred Judy Garland. A second, featuring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, was released in 1976.
A Star Is Born, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is slated for a 2018 release.
Lady Gaga is also scheduled to give a second Coachella performance next Saturday.

On November 25, 2017, the Pakistani government suspended all national private news channels, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Dailymotion across the country for over 24 hours, to prevent coverage of a police crackdown against protesters in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. A number of journalists were also injured while covering the protests.
Around 8,000 security officials took part in the operation aimed at dispersing the activists of Tehrik Labaik Ya Rasool Allah, a religious party that had been staging a sit-in for 21 days in a busy intersection of the city. The Islamabad High Court had ordered the administration to clear the protesters, but the operation proved unsuccessful and it led to protests all over the country.
A number of journalists covering the protests were injured and two news gathering vans of television channels were also set on fire. Journalists who were injured in Islamabad included, Yaseen Hashmi, Islamabad Bureau Chief Business Plus; Qamar Munawar of Dunya News; Sadam Mangat of Channel 24; photographer Tanver Shahzad of daily Dawn newspaper, photographer Pervez Aasi of Metro Watch; Sultan Shah of Aab Tak TV and Shiraz Gardezi of Geo TV. In Karachi, protestors of the same religious party attacked and injured Tariq Abul Hasan and Talha Hashmi of Geo News channel in two separate incidents. Protesters in Islamabad also burned the news gathering vans for the television news channels Aaj TV and Samaa TV.
The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had directed all private news channels to suspend transmission, after accusing them of violating the code of conduct. Similarly, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) ordered the suspension of various popular social networking sites, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Dailymotion.
The media blackout triggered a spate of speculations and left people without information about what was happening in major cities across Pakistan.
The transmission of the television networks and social media platforms were restored on November 26 after remaining suspended for over 27 hours. PEMRA also issued guidelines for the television channels as to how to cover similar protests in the future.
In a statement, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb defended the media suspension and said, "Suspending the transmissions was a painful decision which had to be taken in the national interest after exhaustive deliberations with a view to prevent the spread of chaos and anarchy in the country."
Meanwhile the action by PEMRA has been challenged in the Lahore High Court by the Civil Society Network as being in violation of articles 19 and 19-A of Pakistan's Constitution, which guarantee freedom of the press and right to information.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA), the Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS), the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) and the Pakistan Federal Union Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the blackout of the private news channels by the government.
Authorities Identify Spring Mill Pond Drowning Victim
August 14, 2017
A Lansing man who drowned at the Island Lake State Recreation Area over the weekend has been identified.
The Green Oak Township Police and fire departments were called out around 7:19pm Sunday to the Spring Mill Pond for a reported drowning. Authorities say 18-year-old Caelond Travis Pearson of Lansing had been floating on a personal inflatable raft in the Spring Mill Pond when they fell and became submerged below the surface. The man was said to be outside of the marked swim area and was relying solely on the inflatable raft to stay afloat.
Police say the victim did not know how to swim and the drowning had been witnessed by other family members that had gathered at the park for a party. A coordinated effort to locate Pearson was started once emergency responders arrived on scene. After conducting an underwater search, they were located by members of the Livingston County Dive Team in water that was approximately 24 feet deep, roughly 35 yards from the shoreline. Pearson was submerged beneath the surface for approximately one hour and 45 minutes before being removed from the water and pronounced deceased.
The Hartland and Howell Fire Departments, U of M Survival Flight and Livingston County EMS assisted at the scene. (JM/DK)
UNA Brings Masterpiece to the Stage
By Carole Maynard
FLORENCE – Masterpiece. That is the word Dr. Terrance Brown, director of opera at UNA, uses to describe Giacomo Puccini's “La Bohéme,” UNA Opera's spring 2017 production.
“‘La Bohéme' is known as the epitome of operatic culture,” said Brown, “and this is our time to tackle this masterpiece.”
The full-scale opera, which will be performed in Norton Auditorium Friday, April 21, at 7:30 p.m., and Sunday, April 23, at 2:00 p.m., will feature dramatic sets and costumes, an orchestra and a children's chorus. It will also be performed in Italian with projected supertitles.
“It was imperative to present this opera in Italian,” said Brown, “so our audience could be exposed to a different culture and to, in turn, promote student learning.”
The opera tells the story of young bohemians living in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s. Today's audience is more familiar with the Broadway musical “Rent,” which is based on “La Bohéme,” but the emotions present in the original opera are still present today.
“The story is full of pathos, comedy, anger, sadness, happiness and frustration,” said Brown. “This range of emotions is present in the human psyche, thereby giving the audience a connection to the story.”
Helping UNA Opera tell the story will be an orchestra made up of professional-level players from Florence, Muscle Shoals, Tuscumbia, Sheffield, Nashville and Huntsville. They will be joined by a children's chorus comprised of students from Muscle Shoals Middle School.
“Our team works tirelessly to make opera not so scary for our audiences,” said Dr. Tiffany Bostic-Brown, UNA's director of vocal studies and artistic director for UNA Opera. “We work hard to let the community get to know our singers and our program. Audiences are more dedicated to those they know and watch grow into their artistry.”
And the value of art is the reason these professors and students continue to perform.
“The arts are vital to our way of life,” said Brown. “They preserve our history through song, word, painting and creativity. Every effort we can make to propel the arts forward, we should. The preservation of our culture depends on it.”
Bostic-Brown agrees. “Art exists to express human emotion when other platforms limit us,” they said. “Singing, of course, is very relatable because it is purely the human body exercising all its capabilities through voice and mind.”
Adult tickets for UNA Opera's production of “La Bohéme” are $12 in advance and $15 at the door. Student tickets are $5. Tickets may be purchased at una.edu/music, at the Lindsey Theatre Box Office (MWF, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.) and at the door. Alan Flowers will give a pre-performance talk in the UNA choir room on April 21 at 6:30 p.m. and on April 23 at 1:00 p.m.
For more information, call Carole Maynard, communication and events coordinator for UNA's Department of Music, at (256)765-5122, or visit una.edu/music.
2018 NEW ZEALAND OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS
New Zealand sprint veteran Daniel Hunter won their 4th-straight 50 free title, and their runner-up set a New Zealand record on day 2 of the 2018 New Zealand Open Swimming Championships.
Hunter, who has already qualified for the Pan Pac Championships via their 22.32 at the Commonwealth Games, won the 50 free final on Wednesday with a 22.60. Finishing 2nd behind them was North Shore 15-year old Michael Pickett in 23.13.
That time for Pickett in finals was a small add from the morning, where they posted a 23.08. Both swims were under their old National Age Group Record of 23.14 that they set in May.
This marks now 4 National Age Group Records so far at this meet for Pickett after setting new standards in both the 50 fly (25.46 in prelims, 25.21 in finals) and the 100 free (50.69 on a relay leadoff) on Monday.
Other Event Winners:
After almost matching their Commonwealth Games time in the 200 free earlier in the meet, Carina Doyle was further from the same in their 400 free. Pacing a pair of young middle distance swimmers, Doyle won the 400 free in 4:16.40, followed by 14-year old Erika Fairweather (4:16.89) and 17-year old Eve Thomas (4:17.60). Fairweather and Thomas' times both are Jr. Pan Pacs and Youth Olympic Games standards. Fairweather's time is also a new Age Record in the event, matching the one they did in the 200 on Tuesday. The old record was a 4:21.73 done by Verity Hicks in 2003.

Top 5, Combined, After Day 3:
A former dentist who had operated clinics in West Des Moines and Des Moines has been sentenced to nearly two years in prison for drug and gun convictions.
The Des Moines Register reports that 39-year-old Shawn Michael Kerby was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison for obtaining hydrocodone by misrepresentation and being a user and addict of a controlled substance in possession of a firearm. Kerby pleaded guilty to the charges in July.
Prosecutors say Kerby would prescribe the opiate painkiller to patients who didn't need the drug. They then would have the patients return the pills to them once they were filled at a local pharmacy. The gun charge stemmed from a 2015 search of their home and dental practices that turned up several handguns and shotguns.

Staff complaints against big retailers rise after Smith City unpaid meeting ruling
MARION VAN DIJK/STUFF Spark, Max Fashions, Life Pharmacy, Jeans West, Hannahs, and JB Hi-Fi have allegedly had employees complaining about work without pay.
A union representing retail workers has received fresh complaints against some of the country's biggest retailers.
It brings the total number of complaints to nearly 2000, after the Smiths City Employment Court decision earlier this month.
In May it was revealed the court had ordered the national retailer to backpay staff on or near the minimum wage for six years' worth of unpaid morning meetings.
First Union released a second list of companies alleged to require staff to work unpaid. It included Max Fashions, Life Pharmacy, Jeans West, Hannahs, Spark, and JB Hi-Fi. The six organisations have been contacted by Stuff.
Retail, finance and commerce secretary Tali Williams said employees in the retail sector were already on low wages and could not afford to work for free.

"Companies need to consider the wellbeing of their employees and their obligations to the law. They will be publicly shamed if they don't make fixing this a priority," Williams said.
The union said staff alleged their employers had been expecting, and in some instances verbally asking or texting employees, to either stay back and work late for tasks such as cashing up or tidying up shop, or for work-related meetings for the purposes of customer and sales training.
Some complaints are also in reference to an expectation or request for staff to come into work early to set up shop.
MAARTEN HOLL/STUFF First Retail's Chris Wilkinson says the allegations against retailers are "disappointing".
Spark spokesperson Ellie Cross said in the past six months it had received two complaints on this topic, both which were laid since the Smith City ruling.
"We take complaints like these very seriously, so undertook a full and thorough investigation. In both of these cases, we concluded that neither of the staffs in question had been underpaid," Cross said.
They said, after the Smith City case, all its staff had been briefed on Spark policies and that it had designed its working hour and pay arrangements to avoid anyone being in a situation of doing any prep work, handover work, or after-shift work without pay.
"All Spark store staff are paid a salary rather than an hourly rate to avoid these kinds of issues. Fulltime hours for store staff are designed to cover our longest store opening hours, including a morning meeting before the store opens and any activities that are required after the store closes," Cross said.
First Retail's Chris Wilkinson said the raft of complaints in recent weeks showed how widespread the problem of working without pay was.
"The younger generation are more empowered. This is legacy behaviour and we've seen previous generations rationalise working overtime. But this is no longer appropriate," Wilkinson said.
Earlier this month Briscoes, Whitcoulls, Harvey Norman, Rebel Sport, The Warehouse, Countdown, Cotton On, Noel Leeming, Farmers, Kmart, and Warehouse Stationery were the subject of complaints.
Labour Inspectorate national manager Stu Lumsden businesses would need to backpay staff if they failed to comply with the Minimum Wage Act.
"This is simply about these businesses complying with their obligations – as the vast majority of New Zealand businesses do – and paying their staff at least the minimum wage for every hour worked."

The White House stopped short of congratulating Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday, saying their reelection victory was "no surprise". But it added that there was no congratulatory phone call scheduled between Putin and US president Donald Trump.
Spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on Air Force One, which was carrying Trump to New Hampshire, that the US will work with Russia wherever it can.
"We will work to cultivate the relationship with Russia and we will impose costs when Russia threatens our interests, but we will also look for places to work together when it serves our interests," Gidley was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"We're not surprised by the outcome," they said of the Russian election, according to Reuters.
Several world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, had congratulated Putin after they cruised to victory in Russia's presidential election, giving them at least another six years in power.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called Putin to congratulate him. "Conveying their compliments on Putin's success, the prime minister expressed the hope that under Putin's leadership, the special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia will continue to grow from strength to strength," the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.
Chinese president Xi Jinping congratulated their Russian counterpart on their reelection, saying Beijing was willing to work with Moscow to take ties to a "higher level". "Currently, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership is at the best level in history, which sets an example for building a new type of international relations," Xi had said in a congratulatory message to Putin.
With inputs from agencies
Endless discussions and criticism were triggered by the announcement of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit to Sarajevo on May 20 and the declaration of their participation to 6th General Assembly of Union of European Turkish Democrats (UETD) as the honorary speaker to address voters from the Turkish diaspora.
Politicians, analysts and journalists have been discussing Erdoğan's visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina from different angles. Opposition circles both in Bosnia and Turkey are especially dwelling on this subject.
President Erdoğan's visit was announced while discussions were starting on whether or not the Justice and Development Party's (AK Party) pre-election activities for Turkish voters abroad would be realized.
During campaigns for the constitutional referendum in 2017, the AK Party was banned in some European countries. Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya was even prevented from meeting with Turkish citizens in the Netherlands. Not surprisingly, the same comments came from European politicians after the declaration of a snap election on June 24 in Turkey.
Austrian Prime Minister Sebastian Kurtz said, "We won't let Turkish politicians organize pre-election activities in Austria." Right around the same time, President Erdoğan stated on a TV program that they are "planning to attend an international organization's meeting in which several thousands of [members of the] Turkish diaspora will be gathered from all around Europe."Erdoğan's visit to Sarajevo drew so much attention not only because they are the president of the Republic of Turkey, but also, and mostly, because they are the chairperson of the AK Party and a presidential candidate in the June 24 elections.
On the other hand, the announcement that Erdoğan will be the guest of Bakir Izetbegovic increased the relevance of the visit due to the elections agenda of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Izetbegovic is, of course, a member of the presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the president of Party of Democratic Action (SDA), which is the oldest and the biggest Bosniak party in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Recently, the election commission of Bosnia-Herzegovina announced that the general elections will be held on Oct. 7, 2018. The repercussions of Erdoğan's trip to Bosnia-Herzegovina might be divided into two groups, one of which came through the main opposition Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and eternal opposition circles of Erdoğan.
Turkey, because of its foreign policy on the Balkans, specifically Bosnia, might be criticized for having only one actor as a partner – Muslims in general and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina – but which other global or regional actor (the EU, Russia, U.S.) has been setting out that kind of prospective and diversified policy toward the region or privately in Bosnia-Herzegovina?
It is no secret that Germany supports Croats more than any other nation and Russia is backing Serbs as both sides claim historical, religious and cultural ties between each other. Sometimes analysts have been at a loss between imagination and reality. This is despite the fact that Turkey approaches the Balkans with as much diversity as possible and Turkish investments in Serbia are a clear proof of that kind of policy.
The Turkish diaspora and Bosnia
The SDA's main opposition, the Union for a Better Future's (SBB) deputy president Damir Arnaut waited for an opportunity to blame the SDA's good relations with the Turkish authorities."Bosnians are not a national subject that can be visited without their knowledge," they said.
The second lucky one was Sadık Ahmetovic, an old SDA member, citing that, "If everyone comes to our country in order to organize political meetings, Bosnia would lose its sovereignty."
Of course Milorad Dodik, president of the Republika Srpska, (abbreviated as RS, one of the two entities in Bosnia-Herzegovina) asked about Erdoğan's pre-election rally in Sarajevo and luckily found a chance to blame Bakir Izetbegovic.First of all, Erdoğan was welcomed by the one of the three members of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bakir Izetbegovic, at the presidential building in which ministers of both countries held meetings on several issues.
Secondly, Erdoğan was invited as honorary speaker to the Union of European Turkish Democrats (UETD) general assembly and nothing can be as normal as a nongovernmental organization organizing its meeting anywhere in the world with the required permission of the local authorities.
Third, as previous examples show, any international leader can visit Bosnia any time and hold meeting with related societies. Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic, the president of Croatia , visits Mostar whenever they want and organizes meetings with Bosnian Croats. The same example can be applied for Alexander Vucic, president of Serbia.
Moreover, officials from the EU institutions also pay visits to Bosnia-Herzegovina and set meetings with anyone in any context. Lately, the iron lady of Russia, Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Russian Parliament's upper house, visited Bosnia-Herzegovina and held meetings with presidency members as well as addressing the Parliament and was welcomed by RS President Milorad Dodik.
One can claim that these are not political gatherings but should be aware of Boris Tadic and Vuk Jeremic's appearances during elections in 2010 with Milorad Dodik's election in Doboj as well. Numerous examples can be found of foreign leaders visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina and organizing meetings with their related communities. Erdoğan's visit was the latest.
Dodik openly invited the Bosnian-Serb immigrants to Austria to vote in the presidential elections in December 2016 for the nominees of Norbert Hofer, the neo-Nazi Liberal Party of Austria.The second group, the eternal opposition to Erdoğan, positioned themselves as the protector of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Euro-Atlantic perspective. According to them, relations between Erdoğan's Turkey and the EU and the U.S. are not going very well. Furthermore, Euro-Atlantic powers are not fond of Erdoğan anymore, so Bosnia should be careful with its relations with him. Firstly, the basement of the EU is shaking with its policies toward migrants and increasing right-wing neo-Nazi politics which cause Islamophobia.
The main motivation of the EU is democratic standards and human rights, however nowadays and especially after the Syrian crisis and a huge flow of emigrants from Syria, Europeans have lost their compasses. It should be remembered that before the immigrant crisis and the increase of right-wing politics, EU countries were open to Erdoğan and even welcomed their political campaigns.
The protector of Euro-Atlantic interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina should know that Erdoğan's Turkey is the biggest supporter of Bosnia-Herzegovina's NATO membership while Germany was opposing the implementation of the Membership Action Plan (MAP). One should remember that Turkey has always been supporting territorial integrity, the EU's perspective and Bosnia-Herzegovina's NATO membership.
Treating the legal as illegal
Nevertheless, Erdoğan started their visit with a welcome by Bakir Izetbegovic at the International Sarajevo Airport. Even though it was a one-day visit, Erdoğan managed to attend several meetings. Their program started with a meeting with Izetbegovic at the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina. After, they visited Alija Izetbegovic's graveyard and then went to greet crowds at Bascarsija. They then addressed tens of thousands of people at the 6th General Assembly of UETD at Zetra Olympic Hall and finally gave a speech at the International University of Sarajevo, where they awarded an honorary doctorate.
Discussions on Erdoğan's visit to Sarajevo and meeting with the Turkish diaspora are still ongoing. The messages that Erdoğan gave in their speech to the Turkish diaspora are very important. Recommendations to the Turkish diaspora in Europe such as getting citizenship, being part of society, taking an initiative and being active citizens are really important in terms of lobbying and influence in decision-making processes.
The debate around Erdoğan visit is still continuing in Bosnia. The sister branch of UETD in Sarajevo, which is the Union of the Balkan Democrats (UEBD), was the host of the general assembly and is now facing both applause and criticism. The head of the organization in Sarajevo, Emine Secerovic-Kaslı who is deputy director of STAV magazine, is under great pressure after the event.
Erdoğan started their speech at Zetra Olympic Hall as expected by criticizing European countries for their undemocratic approach toward their rally plans in Berlin, Vienna and so on. They said that Bosnia-Herzegovina shows a democratic stand by providing a chance to meet with the Turkish diaspora in Sarajevo.

Death From Above, née Death From Above 1979, recently returned with new single “Freeze Me.” And now they've shared an accompanying music video directed by Corey Adams, which follows a cabal of weightlifters who live it up in a fancy house as the outside world descends into a post-apocalyptic hellscape. There's lots of gratuitous bicep flexing, and the band's Sebastien Grainger and Jesse F. Keeler appear in the video to serve up a delicious pile of corn dogs. Watch below.
New Delhi: India will host Afghanistan for their first ever Test, the BCCI announced in New Delhi on Monday.
The BCCI rolled out the red carpet for war-ravaged Afghanistan by agreeing to host the country's maiden Test match but chose to cold-shoulder a cricket-starved Pakistan in its latest Future Tours Programme (FTP).
Afghanistan, a team that has made rapid strides in international cricket despite the constant troubles back home, will play its first ever Test against India in 2019-2020, the final schedule for which will be worked out later.
On the other hand, Pakistan, which has been demanding bilateral cricket with India, was ignored at the Special General Meeting which resolved to play more against the likes of Australia, South Africa and England. India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012 due to political tensions between the two neighbours.
When asked why the new FTP does not say anything about playing Pakistan, BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary replied, "It's a question not embedded only to cricket and the BCCI but everybody. So, it's futile attempting to answer the question."
Afghanistan earned the Test status, alongside Ireland this June, realising their five-day cricket dream after impressive performances in ODIs and T20 Internationals.
"Afghans were scheduled to play their first Test in 2019 versus Australia but considering the historic relationship between India and Afghanistan, we decided to host their first Test," said BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary after the Special General Meeting.
Atif Mashal, Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) chairperson, was quick to thank the BCCI for the gesture.
@ACBofficials and @BCCI have agreed that Afghanistan will play its first Test against India. The exact date and venue of the match will be shared in a joint press conference in due course. I personally thank BCCI board for the decision. @BCCI @ARG_AFG — Atif Mashal (@MashalAtif) December 11, 2017
Afghanistan and Ireland were made full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June, becoming the sport's 11th and 12h Test-playing nations.
Besides welcoming them into five-day cricket, the BCCI has extended a helping hand to Afghanistan on a number of occasions.
The team from the war-ravaged nation has hosted its home games in India, most recently the series against Ireland in Greater Noida.
Rashid Khan and Mohammed Nabi became the first two Afghanistan cricketers to be bought at the IPL auction earlier this year.
Afghanistan have come a long way since making its World T20 debut in 2010. They are ranked ninth in the shortest format and 11th in the 50-over format.
After featuring regularly in the World T20, the Afghans made the 50-over World Cup debut in 2015.
They played six games in the tournament co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand with their sole win coming against Scotland.
The addition of a baby, while thrilling, can also be an anxiety-inducing and guilt-ridden experience if you already have a fur baby. After all, our pets came first. How will they react to being pushed off the lap? Fortunately, plenty of pets make the transition easily, and for those that do struggle there's a lot we, as owners, can do in terms of prevention and preparation. Pregnancy offers you several months to get your critters ready, so start with the following things to do with your fur baby before your human baby shows up.
By the time I got married I owned a young mini-Schnauzer and two elderly cats. I'd had my kitties since just after college, and I brought my pup with me when I moved home after living in Honduras. They were a big part of my life and significant contributors to my personal welfare. When I got pregnant, I naturally worried about how they would respond — to my changing body, to my divided attention, and to the squalling creature messing with their collective mellow. I definitely made an effort to smooth the way, but they all acclimatized pretty rapidly to the new normal once baby girl made them debut.
A baby is a huge change for everyone in the family, and pets are no exception. We can help them by making sure that adjustments are made gradually before baby's arrival. It's tempting to lavish our pets with play and tender loving care when we know we soon won't have the time, but that can create greater frustration for them when faced with their new reality. Instead, to best prepare your beloved balls of fluff, try the following:
Snuggle Giphy It's important to meet your pet's needs for affection, and a good old fashioned cuddle session is good for you as well, especially when you're navigating the aches, pains, and emotions of pregnancy. Plus, you can use the time to desensitize them to not-so-gentle baby touches by stroking their bellies and in between their paw pads. You do have to be careful not to heap on so much good lovin' that your pet then feels neglected when baby inevitably takes up all your time. This is a good time to plan for ways that you can get some petting in when that is the case, like inviting your cat or dog to curl up next to you while you nurse or pump.
Go On All The Walks Giphy Your four-legged friend needs exercise, and you and baby will want the fresh air anyway, so pre-newborn is a great time to practice walking with the, for now, empty stroller (literally nothing to see here, folks). Fido needs to learn to keep pace with mama. Parent warns against looping the leash around the handle in case your pup gets a whiff of squirrel and decides to make a lunge for it.
Get Some New Toys Giphy Your life with a new baby will revolve around feeding, sleeping, and pooping, so it's to your benefit to have your pet be able to play independently. Plus, the gift of some new toys sends the message that they're still very much loved by you. If they're going to want to play fetch or tug-of-war with it, it's probably not a good choice for now. For dogs, I like to fill a Kong with peanut butter that I then freeze. It'll keep them busy for hours. Our cats loved their Kitty City jungle gym.
Check Out Doggie Daycares Giphy You're probably going to be too tired to toss the Frisbee for Spot as a sleep-deprived new mom. Hell, you might be too tired now. Do your research before you deliver, and find a doggie daycare or dog-walker that can help fill those gaps once you're in newborn-care mode. At the same time, you can be looking for care for your pets for during your hospital stay. They should have a sitter they know and like or go to a familiar kennel.
Let Them Get Used To The Gear Giphy A new baby means a whole lot of new stuff. For your pets, it's a lot of sniffing to attend to, not to mention a disruption to their environment. Introduce your pet to the crib, swing, and toys, and even smells like diaper cream or baby powder. Whatever your limits are going to be, set them now. (But, I mean, definitely take a picture of your cat before you kick them out of the bassinet.)
Visit The Vet Giphy They aren't going to like it, but according to the Humane Society, a routine health examination and vaccinations are a must for the wellbeing of both fur and human babies. If you feel bad, a pupsicle or a sprinkling of catnip will ensure that all is forgiven.
Looking to make your phone more heroic (or perhaps a bit more villainous)? You're in luck — protective phone case manufacturer OtterBox just launched a new series of iPhone and Samsung Galaxy cases based on Avengers: Infinity War.
The four newly-released cases spotlight Black Panther, Thanos, Iron Man, and Captain America's shield, as well as an illustration featuring all Avengers aptly called "Assemble!" What's more, the Thanos case combines matte and gloss finishes for a cool 3D effect, and the "I Am Iron Man" case boasts OtterBox's first glow-in-the-dark design ever.
The actual cases themselves are of OtterBox's Defender and Symmetry series, which guard your smartphone against scrapes, drops, dings, and other signs of wear and tear. Defender cases are comprised of a shell with a rigid exterior and flexible interior, and feature an open screen that makes them fully compatible with OtterBox's Alpha Glass screen protectors. Symmetry cases, on the other hand, are for those who value a slim device profile but don't want to sacrifice that buffer between their phone and the world. Their dual-density makeup isn't as bulky as other OtterBox cases, and slips easily in pockets while still protecting your precious X or S9.
If you'd like to get your hands on an avenger: Infinity War case for yourself, they're available now at otterbox.com. iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 cases are priced at $44.95; iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus, $54.95; iPhone X, $54.95; Galaxy S9, $44.95; and Galaxy S9+, $54.95.

COLUMBUS, OH - The Powder Coating Research Group (PCR Group) has relocated to a new facility in Columbus, Ohio. PCR Group, an independent research and development company, recently moved to 1823 O'Brien Rd. on Columbus' west side. The new facility boasts a 3000-square-foot operation including an expanded processing area, two isolated spray rooms, a comprehensive testing lab and conference room.
“Our new location gives us greater processing and evaluation capabilities,” said Senior Testing Manager, Nick Page. “In addition, this modern facility offers greater convenience and amenities compared to our former downtown location.” The PCR Group will host the 2017 PC Summit in October at the Columbus Westin and in their new lab.
Hamilton: New Zealand are to rest senior players including Kane Williamson and Tim Southee for part of the upcoming limited-overs series against the Windies.
"It's a long summer, so for those guys playing in all three formats it's important we keep them fresh and build depth leading into a World Cup year," selector Gavin Larsen said in naming the squad on Tuesday.
"Tim and Kane will both take breaks during this series, but there will be others who will also rest throughout the season."
Williamson and Southee will play in the opening one-day international on 20 December before being replaced by Neil Broom and Mitchell Santner for the next two games in the three-match series on 23 and 26 December.
Tom Latham will take over the captaincy in Williamson's absence.
George Worker was confirmed to open the batting in place of the injured Martin Guptill.
New Zealand ODI squad (to play Windies in three-match series on 20, 23 and 26 December): Kane Williamson (capt, first ODI only), Todd Astle, Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham (capt, second and third ODIs), Adam Milne, Colin Munro, Henry Nicholls, Tim Southee (first ODI only), Ross Taylor, George Worker, Neil Broom (second and third ODIs), Mitchell Santner (second and third ODIs)
The Madras High Court has said the Tamil Nadu government should consider giving police officers a day off in a week like every government servant so that they could spend time with their families.When a plea seeking abolition of orderly system in the police force came up on Tuesday, Justice N Kirubakaran said, “Every government servant is entitled to a one-day holiday in a week so that they can spend time with their families. Why shouldn't the police personnel who don't get a weekly off?”“It will help them rejuvenate themselves and relieve them from stress,” they observed.The judge ordered additional advocate general PH Aravind Pandian to get instructions from the higher authorities in this regard and directed them to mention from which date onwards they would like to implement the instructions.“This court holds that the government should take serious view of this matter in the interest of the police and take a decision,” the judge said, posting the matter to July 12.During the hearing, the judge also noted that the police officers were forced to work round-the-clock, sometimes without any holiday. They face stress and mental agony and so do their family members.Stating that this was one of the reasons for deviant activities of police officials, the judge said a conducive atmosphere should be created for the police officers as it would help keep the morale high in the interest of the society.Taking note of incidents in which police personnel were attacked, they said: “The people who attack police personnel are emboldened to do it and they (police) are not secured from such attacks, then what will be their fate?”Meanwhile, a counter-affidavit was filed in this connection by the state DGP, stating that the Greater Chennai Police, except some special units like CCB, CRB, work eight hours a day in three shifts.
An app masquerading as MyEtherWallet.com, one of the internet's most popular services for storing ETH and other crypto coins, has made its way to the top of the iOS App Store charts.
The app rose to the number three spot in Finance category of the App Store this weekend as part of a bitcoin frenzy that saw exchange Coinbase top Apple's free download list in the U.S. In this case, however, it is important to note this app is not official so users should avoid downloading it.
The app developer — who is listed as Nam Le — has three other apps with Apple, including two panda fighting games, but no history of crypto or bitcoin services.
The creators of MyEtherWallet said in a tweet that they have contacted Apple in a bid to have the app removed.
We've reached out to Apple to get an idea how it made it through all of the standard safety checks, and to ask whether it will remain in the App Store.
This is NOT US. We have file reports and emailed and reported. Would appreciate the communities assistance in getting these scamtards out of our lives. PS: We are #Foss4Lyfe https://t.co/SmI8cqNvxA — MyEtherWallet.com (@myetherwallet) December 10, 2017
The iOS app costs $4.99 and it first landed on the App Store just over a week ago. It allows users to create or import a wallet to store cryptocurrencies independently of an exchange.
The app notes claim all keys are stored on device, but nevertheless granting an unknown developer full trust of wallet information, be it importing an existing wallet or creating a new one, is certainly ill-advised.
A crypto wallet consists of a public address where money is sent to, that's shareable, and a private key that grants the wallet owner access — that should never be shared and should be kept securely. Wallets are popular with cryptocurrency owners because they ensure that an exchange doesn't own your coins and, as the case of the explosion of one-time bitcoin darling Mt. Gox shows, you get to keep hold of your money even if all goes wrong at the exchange.
Threats aside, the app is also highly unethical/illegal. The developer is monetizing free and open-source software (FOSS), as MyEtherWallet pointed out on Twitter.
It isn't clear how many downloads the app has gotten, but notes from the most recent update are thankful for users' “early feedbacks.” Tracking service Apptopia told TechCrunch that it estimates that the app has seen around 3,000 downloads so far.
Apple's App Store vetting process is notably more rigorous than much of the competition, so it's curious that the service not only skyrocketed up the charts, but has also secured an ad on the store. The episode is another sign of just how mainstream bitcoin and crypto has become. In this case, Apple may not be aware of what exactly it has allowed into its App Store.
The irony of Apple allowing a crypto knockoff app into the App Store won't be lost on regular watchers who will recall that the U.S. firm has removed all VPN apps from China this year at the behest of the government. VPNs, which are crucial for helping those in censored countries access a free internet, were among the 600-plus apps that Apple itself said it has removed from Chinese version of the App Store in 2017.

Authorities said the storm is expected to drop 5 to 10 inches of rain in the foothills and mountains, "significantly" more total rainfall than on Jan. 9, when mudslides swept through Montecito, killing 21 people and destroying homes. That day, the storm brought 3 to 6 inches of rain to the region.
Work to upgrade roof structure to close theatre operations for the next two months
Upgrades strengthening the structural integrity of the Key City Theatre roof are set to begin, which will close the space for approximately two months while the work is underway.
The project was kicked off on Wednesday with a press conference inside the theatre, as managing director Galen Olstead acknowledged funding partners that include the City of Cranbrook, School District 5, Columbia Basin Trust, and Area C from the Regional District of East Kootenay.
The upgrades were detailed in a 2016 report that identified a number of structural, electrical and mechanical issues that needed to be addressed, which estimated that the lifespan of the building could be extended by up to 25 years.
“The report we received in 2016 felt almost like the building didn't have much of a future and through these partnerships, that future has quickly, almost unbelievably, found a clear path forward,” said Olstead.
The report identified structural deficiencies, particularly due to snow loads in the winter, which needed to be addressed, said Olstead.
The work will consist of strengthening roof trusses and purlins, along with the entire roof structure, while the next phase will focus on mechanical and electrical issues, such as upgrading the chiller unit, air conditioning infrastructure and fire and evacuation systems.
Once the roof upgrades are complete in a few months, phase two is tentatively estimated be completed within the next 24 months if funding for those aspects falls into place, which Olstead is hoping to have hammered out by the fall.
The funding breakdown for the roof upgrades includes $487,000 from the Columbia Basin Trust, $150,000 each from both the City of Cranbrook and the School District, along with $10,000 from Area C of the Regional District of East Kootenay.
The theatre currently sees 45,000 attendees throughout a year, and hosts a number of different types of entertainment, from musical acts to theatrical performances and everything in between.
“It is in this space that we see children braving their first audience, we see teachers inspiring the next generation to dream and we see the legends giving unforgettable performances,” said Olstead.
Rick Jensen, a former mayor of Cranbrook and chair of the CBT board, spoke about their memories opening the building 25 years ago.
“At that, I said the words that a fantasy dies when it encounters major obstacles, but not a dream, not this dream, not a dream supported by so many people,” Jensen said.
“…Thanks to this new roof, the theatre will continue to be a professional, accessible, viable and safe place for live performances, art exhibits and more.”
Cranbrook mayor Lee Pratt says the Key City Theatre is an important piece of attracting new residents and businesses to the area.
“The city does support the arts and culture in the community and we feel it's an integral part of our city,” Pratt said. “I do know that the Key City Theatre is a big part of that and economically and regionally, it plays a big part in what the City of Cranbrook is trying to do.
“When I'm talking to people about trying to entice them to move to Cranbrook, the Key City Theatre is one of the first things we mention.”
Chris Johns, a trustee with School District 5, highlighted much of the people who worked behind the scenes to get the roof upgrades in place, which included staff support from both the school board and City offices.
Johns, who also serves as the chair of the Key City Theatre board of directors, says they are pursuing funding opportunities with both the provincial and federal governments to try and chip away at the estimated $2 million price tag for phase two of the theatre upgrades.
However, while the roof of the Key City Theatre is being upgraded, Johns also added that the roof of the adjacent drama and music room at Mount Baker Secondary School also requires attention.
The funding currently provided by all parties is only attached to strengthening the theatre portion of the roof, even though its part of the same structure that covers the high school classrooms.
The school board recently sent off a letter to Education Minister Rob Fleming requesting $382,250 for emergency repairs, noting the cost savings of addressing the school side of the roof hand-in-hand alongside the theatre upgrades.
“While we are still advocating for a full school replacement, we hope you will see the practicality of funding repairs of the faulty trusses in the MBSS music and drama rooms while the Key City Theatre is upgrading it's own structural integrity,” wrote SD5 board chair Frank Lento.

Report, Match 3: Australia captain Aaron Finch revelled in their record-breaking innings against Zimbabwe, saying it was “up there” as one of the best innings they have ever played.
Finch powered their way to 172, beating their own world record high score in Twenty20 Internationals.
Finch and fellow opener D'Arcy Short put on 223, another world record.
Australia reached 229 for two, the highest total ever scored against Zimbabwe in a T20 international as a slew of records is broken during Australia's 100-run victory.
"It's nice to break my own record,” said Finch. “Satisfying. It's something that I'll look back on when I've finished playing and be really proud of.”
Finch cracked their first six in the fourth over of the morning, and with their third they brought up a 22-ball half century - their fastest in Twenty20 internationals.
Australia took 75 from the Powerplay, with Finch doing the bulk of the scoring while fellow opener D'Arcy Short was content to turn the strike over to their big-hitting partner.
Finch brought up their second T20I hundred at the end of the 14th over, taking just 50 deliveries.
Four overs later, their 15th four took Australia's score to 200, and they then moved beyond 150 with a swipe to deep midwicket. They moved beyond the previous world record high score of 156, which they scored against England in 2013, with their ninth six.
Short eventually fell swinging across the line at fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani to be caught for 46, while Finch fell in bizarre circumstances in the final over.
Stretching out to hit a full delivery from Muzarabani, they over-balanced and kicked their own stumps to be out hit wicket.
“I thought they were going to go with a wide slower ball, so I got back,” said Finch.
“I realized out of the hand that it was a touch wide, so I actually went to let it go and probably just didn't realize how far back onto my stumps I got. Disappointing not to be not out at the end.”
It appeared Zimbabwe might make a fist of their chase when openers Solomon Mire and Chamu Chibhabha rushed past 40 in the fourth over, but once they were dismissed regular wickets quickly stalled the innings.
Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar raced through four overs while conceding just 16, while Andrew Tye's seamers were even more effective. They took three for 12 as Australia inflicted one last record against the Zimbabweans, the hosts slumping to their largest ever defeat in T20Is.
Australia have now won two games on the trot following from a disastrous tour of England, and Finch suggested that the change of scenery and opposition had made a big difference.
“The mood in the camp has always been really positive, and I think coming here we've brought that confidence that we had, but probably with a bit more self belief coming into a new tournament against two sides that we haven't played for quite a while compared to a team that dominated us last summer in Australia and then did so again.
"So new opposition and new environment has made a difference here so far.”
Australia takes on Pakistan on Thursday, and Finch insisted there was no room for complacency.
“Complacency? Absolutely not,” they said.
“We know Pakistan are a world class side. They're number one for a reason. They've got a lot of bases covered, so you've got to turn up each and every day and be 100 percent against them otherwise they'll hurt you.”
A British Columbia mother is begging Albertans for help after their missing son was spotted in Banff, Calgary and Edmonton.
William “Willy” Lynskey was last seen April 11, 2017, in Vancouver. They were six weeks away from completing a computer programming course at BCIT. Then their mother, Heather Lynskey, received a phone call from Willy's brother that the 21-year-old didn't come home.

Surveillance video showed that they took a Greyhound bus to Edmonton, and checked in at the Century Resort and Casino on April 12. On April 14 their cellphone pinged in Calgary. According to Lynskey, it was the last time it was ever used.
“It would appear my son is completely off the grid, so we are totally reliant on tips coming into the police.”
For police in Vancouver, the phone being pinged was enough to determine Willy was safe and their file was closed. Whistler RCMP continue to investigate their disappearance.

Earlier this month, the Facebook page set up to receive tips learned that someone had found Willy's ID at Cascade Mall in Banff, Alta. Lynskey immediately flew to Alberta and learned that employees from the Food Resource Centre had spoken to Willy around Sept. 7, 2017.
“He did need help and they were in poor condition,” Lynskey said. “So our minds are going to a million places as to how they could have gotten to that state or what has happened to him.
“If it was my son, they desperately need help.”
Lynskey says their son showed no signs of mental illness before they went missing, but they now believe that they were suffering from depression – possibly as a result of stress from school. Even still, Lynskey described their son as “jovial, telling stories and talking and communicating” with family members before they went missing.
Also confusing for the family is the fact that Willy didn't empty their bank account before leaving B.C. Lynskey said they moved some money around, but didn't take everything. No one has accessed, or tried to access, their bank account since they left.
WATCH BELOW: Tanya Beja filed this story about Willy Lynskey in December 2017
Willy's family is focusing their efforts on a Facebook page they set up to receive tips. As of 1:30 Monday afternoon, the group had 371 members, many actives with daily posts. Lynskey themselves follows up on possible sightings and continues to encourage people to share photos of their son in an effort to bring them home.
“He's a very, very caring young man. Very sensitive and very shy,” they said. “In circumstances with people they didn't know they were very quiet. With someone they do know and is comfortable with they were very gregarious and talkative and silly and humorous.”
RCMP describe Willy as six foot two inches tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes. When they went missing they weighed about 250 pounds and had short hair and a full beard. Anyone with information about their whereabouts is asked to call Whistler RCMP at 604-932-3044. Information can also be submitted anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or online.

SENSEBACH
WILKES-BARRE — A woman who called 911 to report they had been abducted and sexually assaulted was arrested early Monday after kicking a police officer and offering them a bribe in exchange for their release, according to police.
Jessica Lynn Sensebach, 28, of Nanticoke, is accused of trying to pay an officer $800 to avoid being arrested after they panicked while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, resulting in them making a false rape report, police said.
Officers were dispatched to South McLean Street shortly after 4 a.m. Monday to the report that a woman had been forced into a home and sexually assaulted. Police arrived to find Sensebach “visibly intoxicated” and asking to go home, according to a police affidavit.
Two people with Sensebach told police they had just met them at Lacey's Bar and Catering in Nanticoke and continued drinking at a friend's house in Wilkes-Barre, but that Sensebach had begun screaming and calling the police.
When officers asked Sensebach what happened, their eyes began darting around and they said, “This is fake,” according to police. An officer shined a flashlight on their uniform and pointed out the marked patrol cars, but they wouldn't listen and grew irate, police said.
Sensebach kicked Officer Peter Cordaro in the leg several times before police arrested them — during which time Sensebach hit their head on a porch while struggling, police said.
Sensebach repeated that they just wanted to go home and maintained that they called police to bring them there, according to the complaint.
Police say they encountered a “very strong odor of marijuana” from a vehicle Sensebach had been sitting in, and that during a subsequent search they found a large bag of marijuana and a digital scale.
From the back of a police car, Sensebach began yelling and banging their body on the car door before an officer opened it and they offered the bribe, police said.
“I will give you $800 right now!” the affidavit quotes Sensebach as saying, explaining that they wanted to be released in exchange for the cash.
Police shut the car door and Sensebach began thrashing around some more on the way to the police station, according to the affidavit.
Police charged Sensebach with aggravated assault, bribery, resisting arrest, making a false report, disorderly conduct, possessing marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, harassment and public intoxication.
Magisterial District Judge Thomas F. Malloy Sr. arraigned Sensebach on Monday morning and ordered them jailed at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility with bail set at $15,000.
A preliminary hearing was set for Dec. 19.

Life has definitely been a bit of a whirlwind for Meghan Markle. Moving countries and marrying into a royal family isn't an every day task, but it seems that the new Duchess of Sussex has found a friend to help them settle into London life. Even if you or your friends don't plan on marrying a prince anytime soon, Meghan Markle and Amal Clooney's friendship is still a clear example of what #goals looks like.
Although some people might know of Amal Clooney from their relationship with their husband, George Clooney, she's definitely a formidable force on their own. Born in Beirut, Lebanon, Amal's family left when they were 2 years old during the Lebanese Civil War, according to The Telegraph, and the family ended up in Gerrads Cross, Buckinghamshire.
As noted by Business Insider, Amal is one of the most powerful and respected international human rights lawyers in the world. They have studied at both Oxford and the New York University School of Law, according to The Telegraph. And in 2015, they were chosen as Barbara's Walter's Most Fascinating Person of the Year, as ABC News reported.
It's clear that long before their marriage to George, Amal was making headlines and pushing to be amongst the best in their field. In that respect, there are some obvious similarities between them and Markle, who previously starred in Suits. And thanks to Amal's upbringing in England, Markle can have their help getting used to the London scene! According to People, the two previously met through a mutual friend, but they've gotten much closer after Markle moved to the United Kingdom.
For anyone who can't get enough of this duo, here are a couple moments where the two really demonstrated their new friendship.
For Starters, Amal & George Clooney Landed A Wedding Invite

Among the public, some of whom camped out for days to secure just a glimpse of Prince Harry and Markle, there were many celebrities present at the royal wedding. They just had the benefit of an invite.
Some might be tempted to credit the Clooneys' appearance at the wedding to George's fame, but the more you dig, the more likely it seems that Amal's connection with Markle really sealed their invitation.
Amal captured people's attention with their stunning yellow dress and accessories. And that's not hyperbole — according to Harper's Bazaar, Amal had the most searched royal wedding guest outfit. They stepped out in a Stella McCartney dress that looked amazing, especially whenever it captured the sun. Harper's Bazaar reported that the fashion brand's traffic increased 3,000 percent in the 24 hours after Amal stepped out.
Of course, Stella McCartney's traffic increase can be credited to one other thing, but that only helps to prove Amal and Markle's friendship.
They Have The Same Taste In Clothing Designers

It's definitely a thing that defines a potential friendship. Someone pops out in a pair of really cute boots or an interesting top and you have to ask where they got it from. If that question is marked by a snort or no response at all, it's sometimes a sign that the friendship isn't meant to be. After all, you can't get too close to someone who hoards all the good shopping to themselves.
Nobody may know how the conversation went down between Amal and Markle, but nothing changes the fact that Amal's brilliant yellow dress? It shared the same designer as Markle's reception dress from later that evening, as noted by People.
Given that this was Markle's wedding, it's fair to assume that guests wouldn't share the same designer as them unless they were cool with it. There's no way anyone could have stolen Markle's spotlight to start, but it still says a lot that they shared designers on their wedding day.
They Share Hair Dressers, Too

Celebrity stylist Miguel Perez has been working with Markle for their recent public appearances, according to Page Six, and even styled the duchess' hair for their wedding. But before they started styling Markle's hair, Perez worked with Amal, according to Page Six. In fact, it's Amal that helped introduce Markle to their stylist.
In an April 2018 interview with The Mail, Perez said, "Yes, I do Meghan's hair. I do Amal's, and Meghan is friends with them I also do George's, I do the whole family. Amal put Meghan and me together when they moved here. I do them color, their cut, and their styling."

Given Markle's past experiences with philanthropy, and Amal's work as a human rights lawyer, it'll be interesting to see if this duo cooks up any events or programming together. It's not too far fetched. An inside source reportedly told People, “Meghan and Amal have known each other for a while [and share] many interests."
Dealing with a lot of life changes is difficult, so it's great to see that Markle has a new friend familiar with the country that's willing to help them out. Like I said, #goals.
MUMBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India is not in talks with the government currently to conduct open market purchases of government bonds, a source familiar with the central bank's thinking said, denying a media report that the central bank might consider such steps to boost the debt market.
Earlier on Friday, financial news provider Newsrise cited a senior finance ministry official as saying that the RBI might purchase bonds through open market operations and secondary market trading to support New Delhi's borrowing programme.

On Sunday's "Last Week Tonight," John Oliver harshly condemned President Trump for their response to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., this weekend.
"It's the kind of tragedy that calls for true leadership from whoever is in the Oval Office," Oliver said.
And as far as Oliver is concerned, that's not what happened.
In brief remarks Saturday, Trump claimed there was bigotry and hatred "on many sides" -- a statement that immediately drew criticism across the political spectrum. (Trump delivered another statement Monday morning, directly condemning hate groups and vowing that "justice will be delivered.")
"There honestly aren't that many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think, 'That guy really should have mentioned the Nazis,' but this is emphatically one of them," Oliver said, arguing that Trump had made "a wild false equivalence between Nazis and people who oppose Nazis."
The comedian said there is a reason Trump enjoys vocal support among white nationalists such as David Duke, who said on Saturday that "we're going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump."
"Nazis are a lot like cats. If they like you, it's probably because you're feeding them," said Oliver, also noting that Trump dodged repeated questions about their support among the racist groups at the rally.
"It simply doesn't get easier than disavowing Nazis," Oliver said, describing it as a "presidential gimme" like pardoning a turkey. "It is almost impossible to screw up."
"Incredibly, in a country where previous presidents have actually had to defeat Nazis," they concluded, "we now have one who cannot even be bothered to... condemn them."
Elsewhere in the episode, Oliver took a closer look (warning: the episode contains explicit language) at another one of this week's ominous headlines, escalating tensions with North Korea. Bonus? They tapped "Weird Al" Yankovic for a new ode to the escalating threat of a nuclear attack.
No injuries reported in Hendry County school bus crash
All passengers on a school bus are safe after a hit-and-run accident in Hendry County on Tuesday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
Around 7:10 a.m., a school bus with 10 students on board was driving south on County Road 833 towards the intersection with County Road 835.
A person driving an Isuzu Rodeo tried to pass the school bus in a no-passing zone. The school bus tried to correct but was still struck by the driver of the Rodeo, according to the FHP.
There were no reported injuries among the students on the bus.
The driver and any passengers in the Isuzu Rodeo had fled on foot by the time law enforcement arrived, according to FHP deputies.
If anyone has any information in regards to this crash, they are asked to contact Trooper S. Rongish with the Florida Highway Patrol at 239-938-1800

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a group of mostly young activists pushing for a global treaty to ban the cataclysmic bombs.
The award of the $1.1-million prize comes amid heightened tensions over both North Korea's aggressive development of nuclear weapons and President Donald Trump's persistent criticism of the deal to curb Iran's nuclear program.
The prize committee wanted “to send a signal to North Korea and the U.S. that they need to go into negotiations,” Oeivind Stenersen, a historian of the peace prize, told The Associated Press. “The prize is also coded support to the Iran nuclear deal. I think this was wise because recognizing the Iran deal itself could have been seen as giving support to the Iranian state.”
The Geneva-based ICAN has campaigned actively for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons adopted by the United Nations in July, but which needs ratification from 50 countries. Only three countries have ratified it so far. It organized events globally in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversaries of the World War II U.S. atomic bombings of the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Last month in Berlin, ICAN protesters teamed up with other organizations to demonstrate outside the U.S. and North Korean embassies against the possibility of nuclear war between the two countries. Wearing masks of Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, protesters posed next to a dummy nuclear missile and a large banner reading “Time to Go: Ban Nuclear Weapons.”
The group “has been a driving force in prevailing upon the world's nations to pledge to cooperate … in efforts to stigmatize, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons,” Norwegian Nobel Committee chairperson Berit Reiss-Andersen said in the announcement.
The prize “sends a message to all nuclear-armed states and all states that continue to rely on nuclear weapons for security that it is unacceptable behavior. We will not support it, we will not make excuses for it, we can't threaten to indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of security. That's not how you build security,” ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn told reporters in Geneva.
They said that they “worried that it was a prank” after getting a phone call just minutes before the official Peace Prize announcement was made. Fihn said they didn't believe it until they heard the name of the group proclaimed on television.
ICAN leaders later popped open some bubbly to celebrate the prize, and held up a banner with the name of the organization in their small Geneva headquarters.
“We are trying to send very strong signals to all states with nuclear arms, nuclear-armed states — North Korea, U.S., Russia, China, France, U.K., Israel, all of them, India, Pakistan — it is unacceptable to threaten to kill civilians,” they said.
Reiss-Andersen noted that similar prohibitions have been reached on chemical and biological weapons, land mines and cluster munitions.
“Nuclear weapons are even more destructive, but have not yet been made the object of a similar international legal prohibition,” they said.
Reiss-Andersen said “through its inspiring and innovative support for the U.N. negotiations on a treaty banning nuclear weapons, ICAN has played a major part in bringing about what in our day and age is equivalent to an international peace congress.”
Asked by journalists whether the prize was essentially symbolic, given that no international measures against nuclear weapons have been reached, Reiss-Andersen said “What will not have an impact is being passive.”
Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday exuded confidence that the Congress-JD(S) government in Karnataka will act on its promise of waiving farm loans in its budget and make the state a "beacon of hope" for farmers in the country.Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy will present the state budget on Thursday."On the eve of the Karnataka Budget, I'm confident our Congress-JDS coalition Government will act on our commitment to waive farmer loans and to make farming more profitable."This budget is an opportunity for our Government to make Karnataka a beacon of hope for farmers all across India," they tweeted.The Kumaraswamy-led Congress-JD(S) government is expected to announce a crop loan waiver in its budget to relieve farmers of their distress due to drought for successive years.
Theresa May has come under fresh pressure from within their own party to step down as British prime minister as it emerged on Friday that a former Conservative party chairperson is leading an attempted coup against her.Grant Shapps, co-chair of the ruling Tory party between 2012 and 2015, claims having the backing of nearly 30 party MPs including former Cabinet ministers.He plans to spend the weekend taking that number up to the required 48 MPs to write to the chairperson of the Conservative Party's powerful 1922 Committee of backbench MPs to trigger a leadership contest within the party."I think it's time we actually tackle this issue of leadership and so do many colleagues. We wanted to present that to Theresa May privately. Now I'm afraid it's being done a bit more publicly," Shapps told the BBC.While 61-year-old May's own Cabinet has rallied around her, Shapps accused them of trying to overlook a series of blunders that made May's leadership of the party and the country untenable.Calls for the British premier's resignation have been growing ever since a doomed general election in June, which lost the Tories their overall majority in Parliament.Most recently, calls for May to step down have been revived as a result of a disastrous speech at the annual Conservative Party conference in Manchester.Her key policy messages were all lost in a series of mishaps, including an interruption by a prankster, their own coughing fit and, to make matters worse, a faulty party message sign falling off on stage letter by letter."I think a growing number of my colleagues realise the solution isn't to bury our heads in the sand and hope things will get better. We have spoken to people from the Cabinet and ones who privately agree, I'm sure today publicly they will say otherwise," said Shapps during a series of media statements on the issue.He said the group of MPs supporting them included members across policy divides and covered Brexiteers and those who supported remaining in the European Union (EU).But at the same time there are party colleagues who have jumped to May's support and accused Shapps of stirring up trouble when an "overwhelming majority" want them to carry on as premier."The truth is the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs, the truth is the entirety of the Cabinet, the truth is the overwhelming majority of people, want the prime minister to concentrate on doing the job that 14 million people elected them to do earlier this year," said UK environment secretary Michael Gove, who had been one of the leadership contenders for the Conservatives alongside May when David Cameron exited 10, Downing Street after the Brexit vote last year.Gove's intervention came as UK home secretary Amber Rudd made a very public appeal in 'The Daily Telegraph' asking May to continue despite the "trio of mishaps" that blighted their conference speech."We, Theresa May's government, want to set out a better path, one that actually leads to a prosperous, secure and united country. We can do that, and we will under their leadership. They should stay," they wrote.Charles Walker, the vice-chairperson of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, also came out strongly against the Shapps-led coup attempt.He said, "No 10 must be delighted that it's Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup. Grant has many talents but one thing they don't have is a following in the party, so really I think this is going to fizzle out to be perfectly honest".May, meanwhile, is recovering from their cold and cough that ruined their party speech at home in their Maidenhead constituency before spending the weekend at the prime minister's country retreat in Chequers.Next week, on Wednesday, the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs will meet for the first time since the party conference for what could be a crucial moment for the party's future and May's own leadership.
: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has called for a review meeting of all Delhi government hospitals to check if things are in order. According to a Delhi Government source, the CM has called the meeting after the Gorakhpur tragedy, which claimed the lives of over 60 children in a government hospital. Kejriwal has summoned the Medical Superintendents (MS) of all Delhi government hospitals from across the national capital to their office on Wednesday and asked them to present a status report."The CM has asked the MS of each government hospital in Delhi to remain present in the meeting at their office on Wednesday. They have also asked them to present a status report on the stocks of medicine and equipment, including oxygen cylinders, available with the hospital and mention the reason if the stocks are not adequate. They have sought a report on the condition of the patients, whether enough beds are available and whether patients are facing any problems. This will be a comprehensive review of healthcare in the state of Delhi," a government source said.According to reports, at least 60 children have died in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Hospital due to a crippling shortage of oxygen tanks. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath denied allegations of families that the children had died due to a "shortage of oxygen". On Sunday, the UP CM, along with Union Health Minister JP Nadda visited the BRD Hospital, after which they said, "Nobody can be more sensitive towards those children than me. We are waiting for the report of the committee constituted by our government. I would urge everyone to wait for that report. Not just in Gorakhpur but across the state, if any death is caused by the negligence of the hospital authorities the government will take strong action against the guilty."
Warner Bros. Animation and DC Entertainment bring together two of pop culture's all-time heroes, TV's original Batman and Captain Kirk, Adam West and William Shatner, respectively, to voice the title characters in the full-length, animated feature film, Batman vs. Two-Face. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment will make the all-new movie available October 10, 2017 on Digital and October 17, 2017 on Blu-ray™ Combo Pack ($24.98 SRP) and DVD ($19.98 SRP).

As the sequel to the 2016 hit animated film Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders, the all-new Batman vs. Two-Face finds Batman and Robin back in classic 1960s action, protecting Gotham City from some of the most nefarious villains in comics history. But when the mutilated master of multiplicity, Two-Face, begins staging a daring crime wave across Gotham, the Caped Crusaders must work double-time to discover their mysterious secret identity before they can halt their evil-doing - all the while combating the likes of Catwoman, Joker, Riddler, Penguin, Bookworm, Hugo Strange and King Tut! The new trailer surfaced on Warner Bros. Home Entertainment YouTube earlier today.
The late Adam West leads the star-studded cast in their final performance as Batman. The beloved actor delivers an inspired turn opposite fellow pop culture icon William Shatner (Star Trek) as the criminally conflicted Harvey Dent/Two-Face. This is only the second production of any kind to feature the two titans of the fanboy realm together. West and Shatner first teamed in the 1963 "Alexander The Great" television series that never made it past the pilot.

Here's what Mary Ellen Thomas, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Vice President, Family & Animation Marketing, had to say about the movie in their statement.
"Batman vs. Two-Face is a must-have for all Batman fans featuring a cavalcade of their foes, and an amazing cast including two giants of pop culture, Adam West and William Shatner. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment is excited to bring these beloved characters to animated life, and proud to have been associated with an actor as impressive, gracious and entertaining as Adam West. We salute their extensive contributions to the legacy of the character, and we are greatly appreciative of their cooperation and support in bringing this animated film to fruition. They will be greatly missed."
Special Features for Batman vs. Two-Face include "The Wonderful World of Burt Ward" featurette, spotlighting Burt Ward's life away from acting, particularly their many benevolent activities, and their lifelong devotion to the health and welfare of dogs. Adam West Tribute Panel/2017 Comic-Con International 2017 showcases how, at the 2017 Comic-Con International in San Diego, a panel celebrated the life and times of the late Adam West, the legendary "Bright Knight." Fans laughed, cried and cheered as actor Lee Meriwether (Catwoman from the 1966 Batman movie), director/writer/actor Kevin Smith, actor/radio personality Ralph Garman, producer James Tucker and moderator Gary Miereanu captivated the audience with anecdotes and tales about Adam West.

While it was once thought of as cheating, using ceramic molds is a technique that is increasing in popularity among potters these days. From simple one-piece plaster molds to more complex multi-part molds, plaster mold making allows the potter the freedom to experiment with ideas for form and surface because it takes away a bit of the preciousness of a one-of-a-kind wheel thrown pot. Potter Linda Gates makes their work using multi-part ceramic molds, not only because it allows them to be creative with the forms, but also because it results in a smooth surface perfect for their digital decal decoration.
Today, Gates walks us through the slip-casting process for one of their jug forms using a four-piece plaster mold for the body and a two-piece plaster mold for the handle. – Jennifer Poellot Harnetty, editor.
Fitting the Pieces Together: Making Ceramic Molds
Ceramic decals can be applied to any glazed object, but it makes life easier if the ceramic form has smooth surfaces to avoid the problem of trapped air creating bubbles and holes in the image. This is why I use ceramic molds to make my forms. The ceramic form shown here is a slip-cast jug that I designed as part of a college tableware design project.
Mold Making and Slipcasting 101
Molds are a simple way to create simple or complex forms and make multiple copies of them with little effort. With the construction process simplified, the individual forms lose their preciousness, which allows you the freedom to creatively experiment. In Fundamentals of Mold Making and Slipcasting, Guy Michael Davis leads you step-by-step through the entire mold making and slip casting process.
With a little modification to the original jug design, I made new plaster molds, one for the handle (figure 1) and the other for the body of the form. The mold for the body of the jug (figure 2) is made in four parts – the two sides, the base, and the reservoir.
To prevent leaks when pouring the casting slip, secure the parts firmly together with strong bands cut from rubber inner tubes (figure 3). If you design your mold to include a reservoir, which makes it easier to maintain an even rim thickness, fill the mold to halfway up the reservoir wall using commercial earthenware casting slip. As the porous mold absorbs the water from the clay, the excess is drawn from the reservoir.
The handle mold is also filled with casting slip. Once the slip is the desired thickness (check by blowing on the edge of the mold where the slip and plaster meet), pour the extra casting slip back into the container and leave the mold inverted at an angle to drain into a bucket. Placing it at an angle avoids stalactites of clay forming on the bottom of the piece.
Tip: To achieve even thickness between multiple casts, it is a good idea to time the first casting and use this as a guideline.
When the mold is well drained and the sheen has gone from the wet casting slip (typically about 20 minutes), remove only the reservoir portion from the jug mold, trim the excess clay from the top and clean it up with a damp sponge. I leave the rest of the mold intact for a further hour or so for the form to firm up for easier handling.
Both ceramic molds are then disassembled and the jug form and handle carefully removed. Both component parts are cleaned up with a fettling knife and damp sponge. The handle is attached, and the form is covered in plastic for 24 hours to ensure a secure join.

× Expand Photo by Theo Tate Richard Branding shakes hands with Rich Schardan during the Granite City Sports Hall of Fame ceremony on Nov. 10. Branding, a member of the 1948 GCHS state championship baseball team, was inducted into the hall of fame by the veteran's committee. They passed away on March 17 at age 88.
Four months ago, Richard Branding received one of the biggest honors of their life.
They were inducted into the Granite City Sports Hall of Fame by the Veteran's Committee. Branding received their plaque during the hall of fame ceremony on Nov. 10 at the Performing Arts Center.
Branding earned their hall of fame honor after helping the Warriors' baseball team win its first and only state championship in 1948 and playing in the St. Louis Cardinals' minor league system. They credit their high school coaches for their outstanding baseball career.
“They would straighten me out to where I could correct my problem and do better the next time,” Branding said at the hall of fame ceremony.
Branding died on March 17 in Granite City. They were 88.
A lifelong Granite City resident, Branding graduated from GCHS in 1948. In their senior year, they were part of a Granite City baseball team that finished with an 11-7 record and defeated New Athens 4-1 in the state championship game.
Branding then continued their baseball career at Elmhurst College, where they were a pitcher and a team captain. They then signed with the Cardinals' farm club in Allentown, Pa., after attending a tryout camp at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis in the early 1950s. Branding played two years in the minor leagues.
“I went to a tryout camp at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis and did real good there,” Branding said. “I used the proper techniques and everything and I impressed the scouts who were there.”
For many years, Branding worked as an owner and operator of Branding's Service Station & Illinois State Truck Inspection Lane, which was established in 1940 by grandfather Elmer Branding. They retired in 2000 after 44 years of service.
In November, Branding joined a Granite City Sports Hall of Fame class that included John Moad, Howie Bryant, Jennifer Willis-Carter, Patrick Curry, Denise McMillan-Hale, Frank Holmes, Chris Janek, Shawn Petroski, Jeff Ridenour, John Van Buskirk, Jr., Gus Lignoul and Tom Shipley. GCHS had its first sports hall of fame ceremony since 2012.
Branding was born on Feb. 1, 1930 in Granite City. They were survived by three sons, a brother and seven grandchildren. Visitation will be held from 4 p.m.-8 p.m. On March 21 at First United Presbyterian Church. Funeral services will also be held at First United Presbyterian Church and they're scheduled at 10 a.m. March 22.

LAHORE - As heavy rain paralyzed the city on Tuesday, Lahorites decried poor performance of the city administration, Wasa and the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC).
The flooded streets of the city presented the picture of Venice. People used social media to express their anger -- posted pictures of water-filled streets and videos of people helping those trapped in rainwater.
LWMC launched a boat service and rescued a family on Dil Muhammad Road near Dayal Singh College. Samanabad, Johar Town, Wahdat Colony, Ferozpur Road and Shadman were worst-hit areas of the city. In low lying areas, people drained out rainwater from their houses on a self-help basis. Faisal Farooq, resident of Samanabad, said, “There was water all around my house and I could not find way to my office.”
Naeema Amjad, a hous ewife and resident of Johar Town, said there should be a mechanism to deal with such situations. They said rulers' statements about development were nothing more than rhetoric. Lahore Commissioner Dr Mujtaba Piracha, Lahore Deputy Commissioner Anwarul Haq, LDA director general and Wasa managing director held a meeting on a sinkhole, which emerged at GPO Chowk on The Mall during rain on Tuesday.
GPO Chowk was closed for traffic and traffic was diverted to other roads. The city administration visited Lawrence Road, Lakhsmi Chowk, GPO Chowk, Nabha Chowk, Ek Moria Pul, Railway Station and other rain-affected areas.
Areas like Firdous Market, Gulberg, Misri Shah, Board of Revenue Office and Lawrence Road were also flooded and people stayed indoors. Rainwater was not drained out from Barkat Market Signal Free Corridor even after the rain stopped.
It was supposed to be a summer vacation for a mother and their son.
If they had traveled together as planned, they would have been out of the country and set to return this Saturday.
Instead, Katherine Aikau is making their way home after the tragic murder-suicide involving their son and estranged husband.
The bodies of Gerald Aikau, 42, and their 7-year-old son, Reef, were found on the same Pauoa property where surf legend Eddie Aikau grew up.
We learned through court records that Katherine Aikau had planned a trip with Reef Aikau, but the boy's father refused to sign off on a passport.
Court documents give a glimpse into the Aikau's troubled relationship.
“I have immediate safety concerns for my son,” Katherine Aikau wrote. “I have an out of country trip planned for my son and I during their summer vacation … (but the) plaintiff has refused to assist in processing passport paperwork.”
Ultimately, Reef Aikau could not make the overseas trip.
Why must both parents sign for a child's passport? We turned to attorneys at the law firm Coates and Frey for answers.
“There's always the possibility of flight,” said attorney Bradley Coates. “There are some countries where you get out and don't return. It's very difficult and very expensive to get them back.”
The two-parent consent law decreases the likelihood of a U.S. passport being used to kidnap a child, technically called international parental child abduction.
“She probably wanted the passport for pleasure or other purposes, and the court had yet to enter the order to allow them to do that,” said attorney P. Gregory Frey. “Whether they could have, we're never going to know unfortunately, because they never got to go to court to make that formally.”
Unless there is a custody order, both parents have equal rights to a minor child.
“The problem in this case was if they had had an order granting their temporary sole custody, they might have been able to have more control of the situation,” Coates said. “(But) they kept postponing the order. Nobody had actually gotten custody in this case.
“Domestic violence is obviously at the root of this. That's the root of the problem,” Coates added. “That's very prevalent in Hawaii, unfortunately.”
We reached out to Katherine Aikau, but have not yet heard back.

Manchester United are ready to go head-to-head with Barcelona in a bid to sign French defender Clement Lenglet.
That is according to The Sun, who say the Red Devils are keen to take the 22-year-old to Old Trafford.
Seville centre-half Lenglet is rated at around £20million and has starred in La Liga and in Europe this term.
The French Under-21 international impressed as Sevilla dumped United out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage.
Scouts from United have reportedly been checking on Lenglet's progress and Jose Mourinho is keen to strengthen their backline after an inconsistent campaign so far.

India won the series 3-0 More
What's the story?
Virat Kohli has been on a victorious run as the Indian skipper ever since taking over the reigns of captaincy from MS Dhoni. Their team just whitewashed Sri Lanka in a Test series in their own backyard, in a completely dominant fashion.
Talking about the one-sided result, Kohli said, "The one-sided result is good for us, if it goes against us, we will definitely think about the same. But we are winning and the momentum is with the team. When playing, we don't think where Test cricket is headed and what the future will be.
"As I said before, we have great pride in the intensity with which we play the game. We consider it a privilege that we are able to play Test cricket for the country. Our mindset hasn't changed one bit till now," they added.
India looked comfortable throughout the series and pulled off clinical, ruthless victories in all the three Tests. Kohli is the first Indian captain to complete an overseas whitewash. This is their 8th straight Test series victory as a captain, a record that's second only to the nine won by Australian Ricky Ponting.
In case you didn't know...
India won the third and final Test against Sri Lanka in Pallekele by an innings and 171 runs today (August 14). Hardik Pandya was declared the Man of the Match for their outstanding hundred and Shikhar Dhawan was named the Man of the Series for their consistent exploits at the top of the order.
Each player chipped in at some point in the series, and India conducted themselves like the World No. 1 Test side that they are in all the three games.
The details
Kohli believes that the 3-0 result is not an indication of how strong the Indian unit is, but just a result of the good cricket that their team played.
They added that winning all three tosses worked in their team's favour and conceded that it was a major factor in the second Test especially.
The 28-year-old did not shy away from praising their team though. They said that the team put constant pressure on the opposition to win more sessions during the Test matches, which in turn helped them clinch the series.
What's next?
India will host Australia for a limited-overs tour next month More
Kohli will now lead the team in the limited overs series against the hosts. They will play five ODIs and a one-off T20I before heading back home to host Australia for five ODIs and three T20I games.
Their next Test match will be in November when Sri Lanka travel to India for a full-fledged tour.
Author's take
While the Indian team have performed brilliantly in the past 12 months, they are yet to face the toughest teams in testing conditions. However, it does look like they have it in them to make things go their way in alien conditions as well.

Known Cancer specialist Dr Quratulain said that 40,000 women died of breast cancer in the country during 2017. Talking to APP here on Saturday, Dr Quratulain said that about 90,000 cases of breast cancer were reported during the same year. They said that Pakistan was in list of the countries, wherein the rate of cancer patients was on the rise. Mouth, breast, stomach, blood and uterus, pancreas were commonly hit by the cancer in Pakistan, they added.
They informed that February 4 was marked as world cancer day. The main objective to observe the day was to create awareness among masses. They said that cancer was curable and patients should undergo process of regular tests. When questioned about treatment facilities, they informed that MINAR and Nishtar hospital were offering facilities to cure cancer patients. Dr Quratulain said, ‘We should come up with slogan, ‘We Can, I can', for treatment of the disease.
Health experts and senior doctors Saturday said that the role of stakeholders, doctors, representative of NGOs and society members was important to prevent and cure cancer diseases in the province. They expressed these views while speaking at ceremony of World Cancer Day in Quetta which was organized by Department of Radiotherapy/Oncology Bolan Medical Complex Hospital.
Speaking on the occasion, Bolan Medical Complex (BMC) Hospital, Principle, Professor Dr, Shabir Ahmed Lehri said that collective efforts should be adopted for prevention of cancer disease, which was spreading in society, especially in rural areas of the district. They said that reportedly women were facing breast cancer in the province because there was no cancer hospital in Balochistan.
Dr. Shabir Leheri regretted that there was only one ward in BMC hospital which only comprised 14 beds for 3 million of population, adding that stakeholders should cooperate with doctors in order to build the cancer hospital to decrease such dangerous disease in the province. Head of Department of Radiotherapy/Oncology Bolan Medical Complex Hospital, Professor, Dr, Zahid Mahmood briefed the participants about cancer.
They said in Pakistan annually about 148,000 people were being diagnosed as new cases of cancer and almost 100,000 citizens die, adding that most common types of cancer were oral, lungs liver, cervical, breast and blood. They said prevention is better than cure and urged citizens to avoid using of tobacco including cigarette, cigar, shisha, huqa, niswar, pan gutka, challiya and supari which are main reason of cancer and other ailments, advisizing them to exercise 30 minutes daily to save themselves from cancer disease.—APP
New York (CNBC): U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 665.75 points to close at 25,520.96, capping off the index's sixth-largest points decline ever. The 30-stock index also fell below 26,000. Friday also marked the first time since June 2016 that the Dow fell at least 500 points.
The S&P 500 fell 2.1 percent and finished at 2,762.13, with energy as the worst-performing sector. The Nasdaq composite plunged 1.96 percent to 7,240.95 as a decline in Apple and Alphabet offset a strong gain in Amazon shares.
The Dow posted its worst day since June 2016. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their biggest one-day fall since September 2016 and August 2017, respectively.
“The key for the market today is rising interest rates,” said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The old adage is: ‘Bull markets don't die of old age, they are killed by higher interest rates.' That looms large.”
PanARMENIAN.Net - Unified Young Armenians (UYA), a U.S.-based independent organization, will organize its annual event to commemorate the 103rd anniversary the Armenian Genocide in Little Armenia, Hollywood.
A Twitter post revealed that the March for Justice will start from the Armenian Genocide Martyr's Square in the morning hours of April 24, the day on which millions of Armenians around the world gather to pay tribute to the memory of the 1.5 million Armenian victims of the Genocide, perpetrated at the hands of the ottoman Empire.
Just as in the decade past, the Hollywood, California March for Justice will serve as one of the key focal points for raising awareness for the Armenian Genocide, Assyrian Genocide (Sayfo or Seyfo), the Greek Genocide (Pontic Genocide).
Some three dozen countries, hundreds of local government bodies and international organizations have so far recognized the killings of 1.5 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide.
Turkey denies to this day.
Local and regional banks are making more loans on apartment properties, in some cases significantly more. In one surprising example, the busiest construction lender in the U.S. in 2017 was Bank of the Ozarks, according to Real Capital Analytics (RCA), a New York City-based research firm.
“A smaller bank, it has established itself in a niche to take on larger assignments,” says Mitchell Kiffe, co-head of national production for the debt and structured finance group at CBRE Capital Markets.
Banks are continuing to pour money into apartment projects, keeping the total number of units under construction high. The new developments will continue to stress the supply/demand balance in a growing number of apartment markets where vacancy rates are beginning to creep up and rent growth is slowing down.
Lots of loans by regional banks
Banks provided 71 percent of all construction financing in 2017, according to data from RCA. Regional and local banks continue to gain market share and had the largest market share last year—33 percent of the construction loans made in 2017. Smaller banks continue to make most of the multifamily construction loans under $30 million.
“Regional banks are still searching for yield in this flat yield curve environment… commercial real estate lending is an attractive alternative,” says Justin Bakst, director of capital markets with research firm the CoStar Group.
Top lenders include banks such as Salem Five, which is winning bigger deals in the Boston area, including 10 Shipyard Drive and Hingham Moorings South. Fulton Savings Bank also just financed a major project in Philadelphia.
The market share of the large national banks has been on the decline, falling from 45 percent in 2015 to 28 percent in 2017. “Larger banks have faced increased regulatory pressure from the likes of Dodd Frank and Basel 3,” says Bakst.
“Some of those larger banks may only have been using these regulations as a reason they could quote to their customers for not doing more construction deals so they could keep their exposure in those sectors that may concern them in check," says Thomas Wise, managing director of client services at Trimont Real Estate Advisors, a real estate asset management, due diligence and servicing firm.
For typical construction loans, from $20 to $60 million in size, banks now offer floating interest rates ranging from 275 to 325 basis points over LIBOR. “Occasionally we see a spread seems on the low side,” says Kiffe. “Maybe the market would be 25 basis points or higher… Some of the little banks are not as deep into the market.”
Banks continue to prefer to make recourse loans, in which the bank has a claim on the borrower in case of a default. Non-recourse loans are also available, though they are often smaller in size, often covering 55 percent to 60 percent of the value of the property. “A lot of our clients continue to want non-recourse loans,” says Kiffe.
Fundamentals still strong
Banks are also highly conscious that developers are building more new apartments in some cities than the local markets can absorb. “Urban infill markets have seen a lot of supply,” says Kiffe. That's beginning to push the vacancy rates higher in some places. “Net effective rents probably have not achieved the pro forma estimates set for many projects,” Kiffe notes.
The drop in construction starts has been slower to materialize than many expected. “There continues to be strong demand for rental housing,” says Kiffe.
A UCF alumnus is partnering with Theatre UCF to bring Orlando 26 Pebbles. It's a play about the Sandy Hook mass shooting. Play writer Eric Ulloa drove to Newtown, Connecticut in 2012 after the tragedy and did interviews with many of the town's people. The play uses their words.
“It's mostly a very powerful story about, like we're seeing now in Vegas, how in the absolute most horrific situations people do come together and there is light to be found,” said Ulloa.
Ulloa said the Pulse shooting was personal for them because it was their hangout in college.
“We keep waking up, which is a weird phrase to use, we keep waking up to nightmares instead of waking up from nightmares, we're waking up to nightmares,” they said.
26 Pebbles runs at the Orlando Repertory Theatre through October 8th.

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers.
Even after CFL free agency is done, football fans speculate and debate the merits of each signing for weeks, though it might take months or even years for a hard answer.
Still, Wally Buono, B.C. Lions general manager and head coach, has earned an instant high grade — let's give them an A — just for keeping what they already had. They retained most of their key players about to hit the open market Tuesday. What's more, they were able to sign a couple of important depth players with still enough resources left to try to land a home-run hitter.
That would be the lethal Chris Williams, the former Ottawa Redblacks receiver-returner and one of the top available players in this year's free-agent class.
“He's a marquee player,” Buono said. “Part of the reason for doing this is we want to sign another marquee receiver. We want to have as many good receivers on our team as possible. Part of that is to protect against injury, and part of that is protecting against our competition from getting all the best players.”
Williams and the Lions have agreed on a figure for a one-year deal, it's how that contract is paid out in bonuses and games played that is the sticking point. So is Williams' medical history. The 29-year-old started in 14 games last season before they tore their ACL. Their production up to that point was eye-popping: 77 catches, 1,246 yards and 10 touchdowns.
The Lions are looking at their medical records and will have Williams assessed by Bob McCormack, the team's orthopedic surgeon. The same procedure awaits slotback Nick Moore, who tore their ACL last July. But the Leos were so confident about Moore's rehab that they awarded them a one-year contract last week, with a signing bonus. Buono liked what they saw on video and read in the medical reports.
With the re-signing of Bryan Burnham — a prospective top-five player in CFL free agency — to a two-year deal Sunday, the Lions could have a set of receivers capable of transforming and taking over a game — the physically freakish Manny Arceneaux, the hyper-gifted Williams, the slick-as-a-cat Moore and Burnham, with their over-the-middle cartoon catches. Throw in Chris Rainey and Jeremiah Johnson, coming out of the backfield, and you have six guys at the nexus of winning offensive football and sports entertainment.
“If you look at some of the top guys (Lions) who could have been free agents — Solomon (Elimimian), Bryan (Burnham), (Mic'hael) Brooks, Hunter (Steward) — they would have been very sought-after,” Buono explained. “We kept a lot of our own guys. It's not only important for the locker-room, it's important for fan identification. If I was a fan, and we'd lost a lot of those guys, I'd be pretty upset.”
Brooks, the premier nose tackle who went to at least seven NFL tryouts, re-upped on a two-year contract at the 11th hour. Starting cornerback Ronnie Yell, who also pushed the envelope, was signed to a one-year deal. They were joined in the signing spree by veteran Canadian wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi, plus two more additions from elsewhere — linebacker Tony Burnett, late of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and defensive back Buddy Jackson, released by the Saskatchewan Roughriders in December.
Burnett, a track and field athlete who became a football walk-on and started for the USC Trojans, attended the Lions' 2014 training camp in Kamloops and played two pre-season games for the team before being released.
“Everybody loved Tony,” Buono said. “The thing is, we couldn't find a position for him. Great kid, worked hard, he's tough.”
Burnett played nickelback, safety and cornerback in their brief time with the Lions, but found their niche last season in Winnipeg, as a weak-side linebacker (31 defensive tackles) and special-teams contributor (19 special-teams tackles). That second aspect of Burnett's game is vital, since the Lions don't expect to have Brandon Stewart available for 2017. Stewart, a starting corner and special-teams demon, had reconstructive knee surgery following the Lions' 42-15 loss to Calgary in the 2016 West Division final.
“I know a lot of the guys in B.C. (Burnett attended NFL workouts with Brooks and Burnham) and I spoke with Solly (Elimimian) this morning,” Burnett said. “He's the greatest position player (on defence) in the league. I won't lack for motivation, playing next to him.”
The speedy Jackson (4.38 in the 40-yard dash) was the starting cornerback for the Stampeders in the 2014 Grey Cup game at B.C. Place Stadium. In practice with the Lions this season, he'll get to cover some of the league's best receivers from every angle, on slants, fades and go routes — a beastly chore that should prepare them well for game action.
“This team (Lions) is so close,” Jackson said. “I had a really good feeling about it. Basically, Wally told me they wanted to bring in the best guys and have everybody compete. They have quality players across the board.”
And maybe one more to come, in the dynamic Chris Williams.

The South African Weather Service says it expects tropical cyclone Dineo to move into parts of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo from Thursday evening.
“We will send an update when we need to, because the tropical cyclone can lose track and change direction. So far, the tropical cyclone's track has been consistent.”
NATIONAL NEWS - The South African Weather Service says it expects tropical cyclone Dineo to move into parts of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo from Thursday evening.Forecasters warn the impact of the storm will be felt on Friday with heavy rainfall, flooding and strong winds.Residents living near the Kruger National Park and low-lying surrounding areas have been advised to be vigilant.Forecaster Dipuo Tawana says they're working with disaster management to keep watch over areas which will be heavily affected.
Beijing: China's defence minister said on Tuesday that fighting the threat of terrorism is a top concern to be discussed by a Beijing-led group of Central Asian states at a meeting this week that highlights Chinese ambitions to dominate the Asian security agenda.
Wei Fenghe told fellow defence officials from the eight-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Beijing that the group stood as a force for peace. Foreign ministers from the group were also meeting in Beijing on Tuesday and a head of state summit is planned for June in the Chinese port of Qingdao.
Their two nations are rivals for Asian leadership and share a disputed and often tense Himalayan border.
The focus on terrorism reflects China's hopes to use the grouping to stamp out threats of cross-border support for low-level separatist insurgencies particularly in the predominantly Turkic-speaking region of Xinjiang.
Along with China and Russia, the SCO includes the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan as well Pakistan and India. Cooperation among member nation defence ministries "has made important contributions to maintain peace in the region and the world," Wei said.
Wei said the meeting would also discuss the South China Sea, where China has rapidly been consolidating its claim to virtually the entire strategic waterway through the construction of human-made island military bases.
China has encouraged Central Asian countries to play a bigger role in regional affairs as part of the SCO. Apart from stepping up security cooperation, China has funnelled significant economic investment into Central Asia, a critical hub in President Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road infrastructure initiative connecting the Eurasian continent. Beijing has also sought a bigger role in Afghanistan's political future, pushing for settlement talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
Canada's path to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan all of a sudden looks a lot simpler, thanks to bizarre circumstance.
Heading into the weekend, Spain looked set to claim the final European qualification for next year's tournament in Japan. All they had to do was beat Belgium in Brussels, something which seemed likely given the Spaniards had been playing very well and just upset Romania to put themselves in the driver's seat, while the Belgians had only a win over lowly Germany to hold up this year.
But that all came to a crashing halt after the Belgians upset the Spanish 18-10.
To say almost no one expected that isn't an exaggeration. What it meant was Romania, who had been seen as the favourites to win the final European spot when the calendar turned to 2018 and who have been causing nightmares for Canada for years, leapt back above Spain and are off to the world cup.
The Spanish team had drawn plenty of media attention, a rarity in a country where soccer dominates the headlines. It had been 20 years since Spain had qualified.
If they had won in Belgium, Romania would have been set on a path that would have delivered them — or possibly Samoa — into a qualification tournament next November for the final Rugby World Cup spot, with Canada as the main rival.
But now, not. And it's messy. Despite Sunday's game being a Rugby World Cup qualifier, it was also part of the Rugby Europe championship. Rugby Europe, the regional body, took authority for the game, not World Rugby.
Assigned to officiate the game were a team of three officials…from Romania. Oh and by the way, the president of Rugby Europe is Romanian.
Oh, and in Sunday's game? Spain sure didn't play very well. They were penalized 28 times by referee Vlad Iordachescu.
Yes, 28 times is crazy for almost any team on the international stage — and it's even crazier for Spain, who had been consistently keeping their penalty counts in the low teens.
So incensed were the Spanish players that they swarmed them after the full time whistle and security had to escort them from the field.
“I'm the captain and I would like to apologize for what happened with the referee,” Spanish captain Jaime Nava told Radio Marca. “The image at the end of the game does not represent the sport nor the values of this team. It must be understood however, we've lost part of our dream.
“I don't want to think that rugby [has been fixed] to put us out. When we were assigned Romanian officials, we were shocked. But this is rugby, the values are assumed. The dressing room is down, sunk. For sure, today rugby has lost.”
Rugby Europe has declared the referee assignments were determined before the competition even kicked off — but as Americas Rugby News' Bryan Ray points out, a fully-qualified officiating crew from England were working the Russia vs. Germany game being played just a couple hundred kilometres away. That administrators didn't see the need to remove any risk of perception of bias here is truly bizarre.
The quality of the referee's performance has come under heavy scrutiny.
No one appears to be truly thinking “fix” but it sure stinks. It stinks so much that World Rugby has stepped in to essential say “we're investigating.”
Statement: While World Rugby does not appoint match officials for the Rugby Europe Championship, it is in contact with Rugby Europe to understand the context of events relating to the Belgium v Spain match in Brussels on Sunday, which doubled as an important RWC 2019 qualifier. — World Rugby (@WorldRugby) March 19, 2018
World Rugby wants “understand the context of events” from Rugby Europe's point of view, they've said.
Sir Clive Woodward, the former England coach who's never shy to share their opinion, says the game should simply be replayed.
This is just not right and World Rugby are totally right to step in – the game sjouke be replayed https://t.co/tAHeICELFp — Sir Clive Woodward (@CliveWoodward) March 19, 2018
It's hard to imagine that happening.
Anyway, as it stands, Spain will now play Portugal. The winner there will play against Samoa. Samoa coach Fuimaono Titimaea Tafua gave an interview weeks ago where they talked openly about playing against Spain, when it still looked like they were going to play Romania. More importantly, they said while their squad will feature most of its European-based professionals, they will be missing their Super Rugby players. Even so, you still figure the Samoans are the favourites there, but remember the loser of that series will play against Canada next November.
(This is also where Romania's gain helps; you could see a scenario where the Oaks defeated the Samoans and sent Samoa off to play the Canadians. Samoa is another long-standing problem team for Canada.)
If it is indeed Spain who will be in the repechage mix — the tournament is expected to be played over three weekends in November at a still to be determined French locale — alongside Canada, likely Hong Kong and a still to be determined team from Africa (we won't know their identity until August), the Canadians will go in as strong favourites. They defeated Spain last year and both Hong Kong and the African team are expected to be below Spain's quality.
And so the Canadians will continue to look ahead and prepare. There's a confirmed test in Edmonton June 9 against Scotland. There's expected to be a game against the USA. And there will be a third game in June, though who it is is still unconfirmed, though a source said it is not Georgia, even though the Lelos are playing the USA that month.

Amazon's AWS cloud computing service hosted its annual NY Summit today and it used the event to launch a new service: Amazon Macie. The idea behind Macie is to use machine learning to help businesses protect their sensitive data in the cloud. For now, you can use Macie to protect personally identifiable information and intellectual property in the Amazon S3 storage service, with support for other AWS data stores coming later this year (likely at the re:Invent conference in November).
The company says the fully managed service uses machine learning to monitor how data is accessed and to look for any anomalies. The service then alerts users of any activity that looks suspicious so they can find the root cause of any data leaks (whether those are malicious or not). To do all of this, the service continuously monitors new data that comes into S3. It then uses machine learning to understand regular access patterns and the data in the storage bucket.
The service also automatically detects certain data types like full names, addresses, credit card numbers, IP addresses, driver license IDs (U.S. only), social security numbers and birth dates, but it also can automatically detect different content types (email, SEC forms, data logs, database backups, source code, etc.).
All of this data then flows into a central dashboard that highlights high-risk files and other information about how users and other applications are accessing data.
As with all AWS services, pricing is complicated, but mostly based on the number of events and data the service processes every month. Because a lot of costs are bound to the initial classification of the data, the first month of usage is also likely the most expensive.
For now, Macie is only available in AWS's U.S. East (Northern Virginia) and U.S. West (Oregon) regions, though this footprint will likely expand over time.
It's worth noting that Amazon also announced that Glue, the company's service for preparing and loading data into its various database and storage services, is now available to all customers. In addition, the company used today's event to launch a new migration hub for enterprises that want to migrate some of their workloads to the cloud, as well as updates to the Elastic File System (now with encryption at rest), AWS Config and AWS CloudHSM for better key management.
Sweden's Birgit Nilsson: the greatest Brünnhilde of them all

From a certain perspective, the history of Wagner's “Ring” Cycle can be charted as a litany of the artists who have undertaken to sing the astonishingly challenging principal roles — the tenors who have tackled the daunting demands of Siegfried and Siegmund, the basses and baritones who have mustered the paternal gravitas or malice for Wotan or Alberich, and above all the sopranos who have thrilled listeners with the athleticism and poignancy of the warrior maiden Brünnhilde.
Any such list would have to include the Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson, a performer of remarkable technical prowess and theatrical flair who emerged during the 1950s and '60s as one of the greatest interpreters of the role.
Nilsson has been in the spotlight recently, amid a flurry of activity designed to celebrate the centennial of their birth on May 17 (she died on Christmas Day 2005, at 87). Two huge collections of their recordings are in the pipeline — one from Decca and another from Sony Classical — as well as a documentary, “Birgit Nilsson: A League of Them Own,” which probably will have nothing to do with baseball.
Already available is a mammoth limited-edition commemorative volume, “Birgit Nilsson 100: An Homage,” which is packed with photos, essays, memorial tributes and more.
Nilsson made their first U.S. appearance at the San Francisco Opera, singing Brünnhilde in a 1956 production of “Die Walküre.” In The Chronicle, music critic Alfred Frankenstein compared their artistry to that of Kirsten Flagstad, who was at that time the leading Wagnerian soprano.
“Her vocal color is a little less rich,” they wrote, “but it has something of the same huge ring, something of the same sheer grandeur of sound, and much of the same tirelessness, power and unfailing accuracy.”
In addition to the flood of centennial memorabilia, the Birgit Nilsson Foundation in May awarded a prize worth $1 million to soprano Nina Stemme — a fellow Swede who sang Brünnhilde at the War Memorial Opera House during the company's last “Ring” in 2009.

“China-Africa relations have today reached a stage of growth, unmatched in history. We should scale the heights, look afar and take bold steps”- President Xi Jinping (2015).
By Charles Onunaiju
More than two years, since Chinese leader, President Xi Jinping summarized the phenomenal level, China-Africa have then attained, and urged for the relations to aspire to new and higher “heights”, Nigeria and China took “bold steps”, last week to nudge the bilateral relation between them to new heights, thereby scoring major success in extending the frontier of Sino-Africa Cooperation. As a work in progress, the China-Africa Cooperation by the range of issues it has covered and the intensity of its engagement, is considerably phenomenal but still at a primary stage of its development, with profound potentials and prospects in the distant future, if both sides continue to “take bold steps and look afar”.
Last week in Abuja, between August 10th and 11th, the visit of Chinese senior official, the vice minister of the state council information office, Mr. Guo Weimin and their delegation to Abuja, added fresh momentum to the dynamism and vigor of the existing bilateral cooperation between Nigeria and China.
Their wide ranging activities while in Nigeria and the enthusiasm with which the Nigerian side welcomed and engaged him, demonstrated the unique bond of bilateral cooperation and the far-reaching prospects of the continuous strengthening of the bilateral ties for both, the two countries and the wider Sino-African Co-operation.
The Chinese vice minister, Guo Weimin undertook their first assignment in Nigeria not in the posh prescient of the state house but in the far-flung community of Hulumi village, where they launched the satellite television project, as part of the ten cooperation plans that president Xi Jinping outlined at the historic second summit of the heads of state and government of the forum on China-Africa Cooperation, (FOCAC) which held in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2015.
In the ninth of the ten plans, president Xi has said that “we will implement China-Africa Cultural and People to People Plans”, from among which China will “provide satellite Television reception to 10,000 African villages”. In carrying the launch of the satellite Television project in Hulumi village in the federal capital territory of Abuja, the vice minister and their team fulfilled one of the major outcomes of the second Johannesburg summit of FOCAC and further underscored the reputation of the FOCAC process as exemplary framework and mechanism of international cooperation best known for timely delivery of results in its summit's or conference decisions and outcomes. In Hulumi village itself, emotions overflowed as villagers thanked China for taken the measures that would connect them to the outside world.
From the Hulumi village, Mr. Guo Weimin and their delegation walked into the warm embrace of almost 50 media practitioners and think tanks who gathered for media dialogue between Nigeria and China, hosted by the chairperson of Leadership group, publisher of the Abuja-based national daily newspaper, the leadership newspaper, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah. The Leadership group Chairman in their opening remarks at the dialogue, said that China-Nigeria relations has covered crucial mileage but has great potential and pointed that media cooperation between the two sides could play outstanding roles in extending the frontiers of the bilateral
cooperation. They recalled fondly China's achievements, paying tributes to China's commitment to their cooperation with Africa and urged the media to continuously explore ways to nurture the understanding between China and Nigeria. The opening comments of the host of the forum, opened the flood gates of commentaries by participants on the ways, bilateral cooperation between Nigeria and China can be strengthened.
There was unanimity among participants that China is reliable and consistent partner of Nigeria, and that such partnership based on equality and mutual respect for each other, have yielded lots of positive results.
The Chinese vice minister of the state council information office, said that the Chinese side is determined to expand media ties with Nigeria, with a view to strengthen the strategic partnership that already exist between the two countries. According to him, promoting media ties was one of the ten cooperation plans which president Xi Jinping outlined at the 2nd summit in Johannesburg in 2015, and has therefore come to Abuja to engage diverse stakeholders on how to deepen cooperation in the very vital aspect of China-Nigeria cooperation in particular and China-Africa relation in general.
According to Mr. Guo Weimin, as China's relationship with Africa formed the “cornerstone of the foreign policy” of Chinese government, “the purpose of my visit is to implement important agreements that were reached between the Chinese and Nigerian presidents on developing the strategic partnerships of China-Nigeria relation.”
They added that “mass media serves the most special and important part introducing the China-Nigeria cooperation, recording the China-Nigeria exchanges and spreading friendship. They further pointed out that the media of both countries have crucial roles to play in promoting people-to people relations between both countries and being a positive voice for developing nations in the struggle to bridge the information gap with the advanced developed countries.
According to him, “we will continue to tap into the rich content of China-Nigeria friendship cooperation to broadcast and spread the most touching stories to the world, to broadcast and report the lively cooperation results between our two countries.”
The deputy ambassador of the Chinese embassy in Nigeria, Mr. Li Jing has earlier recalled that Nigerian media has already benefited from one of the China-Africa ten cooperation plans, reached at the FOCAC summit in South Africa, where China offered to train 1,000 media professionals from Africa annually.
The media dialogue ended with a glowing tribute to ambassador of the Peoples Republic of China to Nigeria, Dr. Zhou Pingjian, whose several scholarly interventions in public discourse of the issues in the Nigeria-China bilateral cooperation have brought lots of clarity and has given the media ample and considerable impetus to report more factually and objectively on the relations between the two countries.
Despite that the exhaustive but the constructive media dialogue stretched far beyond its original schedule, the visiting Chinese vice minister and their delegation were on hand, the next day to sign the memorandum of understanding, (MoU) with the Nigeria minister of information and culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed in the area of media and cultural relation, a crucial milestone in the bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Nigeria's minister of information and culture at the signing ceremony said that the signing of the MoU will further deepen the already excellent relationship between the two countries, and expressed the hope that some provisions of the MoU would encourage the News Agencies of Nigeria and China to reflect in their reporting the social, economic and cultural development in both countries. On their side, the Chinese vice minister, Mr. Guo Weimin said that the signing of the MOU marked a new beginning in the relationship between the two countries, particularly in the area of media and cultural relations, adding that staff training and programme exchanges will further solidify the cultural ties between the two countries, as they concluded their highly successful visit to Nigeria.
The new momentum in China-Nigeria cooperation and the wider China-Africa relations is coming in the heels of the crucial 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the later part of this year. The highly anticipated national congress of the CPC, will consolidate and advance the progress made in deepening reforms and opening up policy, with China engaging more widely and intensely with the rest of the world. Already the China-Initiated Belt and Road process, a global system of inter-connectivity of infrastructure networks, people-to-people contacts and cultural engagements are taking shape as the emerging global architecture for more functional, cooperative and inclusive order and the dimension of Nigeria-China relations can make meaningful contributions to it, it grows in strength and vigour.
– Mr. Onunaiju, director, Centre for China Studies, (CCS), Abuja-Nigeria.

It's amazing what a win can do for a team's confidence.
Down 3-1 to the Boston Bruins heading into the third period of Game 2, things looked bleak for the Ottawa Senators, who were suddenly lacking in confidence. Staring an 0-2 series deficit in the face, Dion Phaneuf led a furious Sens comeback with a three-point effort to even up the best-of-seven and breathe some life back into the team as the series shifted to Boston.
But make no mistake, without Phaneuf's heroics the Sens were 20 minutes away from realizing the same fate as they did in Game 1 – taking the loss as a result of a comedy of mental errors. “We realized that the first game we kind of gave away, and again we were about to give this one away as well,” Senators captain Erik Karlsson told the assembled media post-game.

Jekyll and Hyde
The captain was absolutely right in their assessment of their team's play through the first two games, as they played well enough to win both but nearly came away empty handed as many times. It was an ironic twist for the Sens, who have prided themselves on their defensive zone play throughout the regular season yet failed at the worst possible time by turnovers and sloppiness.
Through the opening two games of the series, the Senators have turned the puck over a whopping 36 times to just 17 for Boston, which played no small part in the Bruins' Game 1 victory. Each of Boston's two goals was the result of poor puck management by the Senators, who on both occasions tried and failed to clear the puck numerous times before Boston took advantage of some fatigued defenders.
A similar destiny almost felled the Senators in Game 2, with Craig Anderson's gaffe zapping all the momentum gained from Clarke MacArthur's momentous game-tying goal only 1:42 earlier. Fortunately, the Senators played relatively clean for the remainder of the game and were able to convert that into a three-goal comeback.

That is perhaps the most frustrating takeaway from the first two games – that a few collective minutes of mindless play could be the difference between going to Boston tied 1-1 and being up 2-0. Through the first two games, the Sens have outshot the Bruins 56-54 (but trail 96-95 in 5-on-5 shot attempts), surrendered only one power play goal and hold an 86-80 edge in hits.
More importantly, they've held Brad Marchand, David Pastrnak and Patrice Bergeron to a combined two goals and five points (one of those goals coming on the power play). Given the success that line has enjoyed this season and the threat it poses, the Sens should be incredibly pleased they have thus far limited the damage.
Outside Looking In
For all the good the Sens have done – both perceived and actual – there's also a lot of work that remains to be done. While they've outshot the Bruins, and are nearly equal in shot attempts, many of those shots have come outside the home plate area (widely considered to be the danger zone), which isn't good enough when facing a goalie of Rask's calibre.
In Game 2, Ottawa was fortunate enough to convert on two of their shots from outside the home plate area. Chris Wideman's shot from the blue line didn't look too menacing but benefited from a bottleneck in front of Rask, while Phaneuf's game-winning one-timer from the point was well positioned and also the benefactor of a bit of a scramble in front of the net.
Overall, Rask has faced just nine shots from the high-danger area at even strength, stopping all of them, while allowing two goals on 10 shots from the medium-danger area. To Ottawa's credit, Boston hasn't fared much better, with only seven high-danger shots on Anderson, of which they have stopped six, and two goals on 13 shots from medium-danger range.
Neither team has appeared willing to give an inch in the offensive zone – and it's not in the Senators' DNA to start taking risks, most definitely not in the playoffs – but something's gotta give. The Sens have done a great job containing Boston's big threats for the most part, but that likely can't continue to the same effect and they can't rely on sneaky perimeter shots to be the difference in the series.
If they have any hope of pulling ahead for good, they'll have to pick their spots and try to generate some action in the middle of the ice. Obviously, that's every team's objective and it's easier said than done, but the Sens have weapons at their disposal they could use as decoys (a la Game 2) to free up some space for their teammates.

The Injury Bug
On the injury front, both teams have faced some adversity but the Bruins' situation has been worse. Torey Krug and Brandon Carlo have yet to play in the series, while Colin Miller left early in Game 1 after taking a hit from Mark Borowiecki and didn't play in Game 2, during which Adam McQuaid also left early.
Borowiecki also couldn't escape injury – some calling it karma – as they crashed hard into the boards in the second game of the series and needed help hobbling to the dressing room. Whether they play in Game 3 is still up in the air, but the injury is still a blow to the Sens who at long last looked healthy on the blue line with Marc Methot finally returning from their gruesome injury.
Fortunately for the Sens, they have a number of players they can turn to (Fredrik Claesson, Ben Harpur and Jyrki Jokipakka) who have at least some experience playing with the team this year. Borowiecki's contributions to the game are debatable, but one fact that is undeniable is the physical presence they bring to every game, which would be tough to replace.

: In a bid to bridge the lag in actual revenue accrual, the Finance Ministry will from this fiscal shift to cash basis accounting for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) where monthly collections will be reported on the first working day of the following month.Till now, monthly tax returns under GST, which has amalgamated 17 central and state taxes into one, were allowed to be filed by the 20th of the following month and revenues collected were reported on 26th -- almost a month-long lag between collections and their reporting.This had led to a situation wherein the government was able to collect tax revenue for one month less in the first year of GST rollout.To overcome this, GST collections for the month of April will be reported on actual basis on May 1, officials said.Technically, GST collections of March should have been reported this week. But to enable a switchover to the cash-basis accounting, only the Integrated-GST -- which is levied on inter-state movement of goods as well as imports -- will be shown in March tax collection. This amount is about Rs 20,000 crore, an official said.The March collection of Central GST (C-GST) and State GST (S-GST) would be reflected in April data which would be made public on May 1, they said.So, the April numbers, which will be released on May 1, would be highly inflated as it would contain the collections made in April as well as CGST and SGST collections of March. From May onwards, the monthly collections of CGST, IGST and SGST would be reported on June 1."Moving to cash basis accounting and reporting the amount of tax received in a particular month immediately after the month end will reflect better accounting position for the GST collections," the official told PTI.The official said the Finance Ministry will in a day or two come out with the month-wise GST collection data for the entire 2017-18 fiscal and for the month of March it will only account for IGST revenues of about Rs 20,000 crore collected during the month.Currently, summary returns GSTR-3B for a particular month is filed by the 20th day of the subsequent month."The April GST collections could see a spike over the previous months as along with IGST collections for the same month, and CGST and SGST collections for March, there would be some returns which would filed in the month well in time. The GST proceeds would stabilise from the second month onwards," the official said.Since the government had in 2017-18 budget accounted for only eight months (July-February) revenue, shifting to cash basis accounting will be easier for computing government revenues.As per official data, GST collection for February was Rs 85,174 crore, while the collection in January was Rs 86,318 crore.In December and November GST collection was Rs 88,929 crore and Rs 83,716 crore respectively."April is the best month to change the method of accounting, especially in the scenario where the tax collections in 2017-2018 was quite bumpy and lacked comparability due to numerous reasons," AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said.

The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Kpotun Idris has restated their commitment to the capacity development of police officers in the country.
Idris who was represented by the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) in charge of training, Emmanuel Iyang, stated this yesterday in Abuja during the commencement of a 3-day capacity building workshop organised for the Nigeria Police legal officers/prosecutors and investigators.
The workshop which was in collaboration with BASTION Chambers, the IGP said was meant to make the officers more effective and efficient.
They said, “Police training which shall be based on the fundamental values of democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights shall be developed in accordance with the objectives of the police.”
The police boss said the workshop which is themed ‘train the trainer' “will equip officers with skills which they will in turn transfer back to their respective units with a view of training other officers under them.
“This programme will be in different phases and this is just the first phase of the programme. I assure you that we are very much committed to the development of our officers who are always instrumental on the field. We will continue this and ensure the best for our officers.”
It will be recalled that the IGP on assumption of office more than a year ago, made training and development one of the cardinal objectives of their administration.

It may seem as though crossing guards have one job: to get people from one side of the road to another. But their overall goal is to promote safety and, sometimes, that means they have to go above and beyond their routine duties.
One California crossing guard proved this to be true when they heard a child begging for help. The crossing guard relied on both their patrolling know-how and their fierce motherly instinct to save the eight-year-old from impending danger.

Last year, rapper Jay-Z released an album entitled “4:44,” in which they taught financial literacy through their verses. Jay-Z came from nothing and he's grown to learn how to accumulate wealth, something the average person isn't taught how to do.
Most Black children attend public schools in neighborhoods that don't have the best resources, which shows by the type of education those children receive. By the time an average Black student graduates from high school they won't know how to do their taxes, they don't know what credit is or how to build it, and they don't understand the concept of wealth.
It's time for our children, and the entire Black community to re-educate ourselves on Black Generational Wealth.
But, what does it mean to have Black Generational Wealth? Well, let's start by taking the black off, and just focus on generational wealth.
Wealth isn't just money, it's everything you own such as land or a business, and the average Black person doesn't own those things.
But, now let's add on the generational. Generational wealth is at least one family member being able to pass down wealth (i.e. a business) to a younger member of the family, and over time that wealth increases, if done correctly.
And, finally, we add on the Black to generational wealth because this is something the Black community doesn't usually have. We aren't taught how to accumulate wealth, and we aren't taught how to keep that wealth to be able to pass it down to future generations.
President of NAACP Milwaukee Fred Royal says it's not just that our community is uneducated, but it also starts with our past.
One of the biggest assets to own in America is a home, and it's written in our history that Black people were blocked from moving to certain areas: redlining, which made it so the Black community had to live in the poorer neighborhoods, meaning their homes never increased in value.
Royal also added, back in the 1950s-60s, the Black community wasn't focused on saving or starting a business because their main goal was to own a home. When a home is passed down that doesn't have much value to it then little to no wealth has been transferred.
Royal says the city needs to increase housing credits and we also need to take some responsibility for our positions in life.
“We have to do this collectively. Everybody has a role to play in this,” said Royal. “And, we gotta [sic] have the expectation that we have to support our own businesses.”
There's an assumption in the Black community that Black people don't support other Black people, but if we want to start progressing economically than we must pull our money together, said President & CEO of The Center for Self Sufficiency, Carl Wesley.
Wesley says sometimes for Black businesses to stay afloat they must raise their prices, and this turns the Black community away.
“Buy Black even though it's against your economic interest,” they said.
But going back to our children not being taught financial literacy, Wesley believes these types of conversations need to be held at the dinner table. If we want to start accumulating wealth than we must start as early as we can, and that starts with our children.
Just like many issues it all starts with educating oneself, and others. Bill 280 was established last year to incorporate financial literacy into the curriculum of all Wisconsin public schools, and with more initiatives like this, the younger generation is sure to build their wealth faster and better than generations before them.
“Everyone supports renewable energy,” said Matthew Benson, spokesperson for the utility-funded opposition initiative. “The question is whether we are going to have an Arizona plan that is created and implemented by Arizona leaders and officials, or whether we're going to have a plan crammed down our throats by a political activist from California.”
Stevie Wonder had some altruistic reasons for performing their albums “Talking Book” and “Innervisions” from beginning to end on Sunday night at Staples Center.
For starters, they were using the records, both from their early-1970s artistic peak, to lure folks to this year's edition of their annual House Full of Toys benefit concert. (Beyond paying for tickets, showgoers were asked to bring unwrapped gifts to be distributed over the holidays to underprivileged families around Los Angeles.)
For another thing, the singer was looking to channel the albums' positive thinking at a moment when “too many people in high positions are creating negativity,” as they put it in one of the many rambling speechlets that pushed the production toward the four-hour mark.
Yet Wonder wasn't without a more selfish motivation.
Addressing the crowd before they cracked open “Talking Book” — which itself followed a lengthy stretch of table-setting appearances by Tony Bennett, Pharrell Williams, Dave Matthews and others — Wonder said they were revisiting the old work to see if it still moved them — “to hear if I still like it and to critique what I can't change,” they explained with a grin.
“Do I still feel that joy in my heart?” they asked. “Am I still optimistic? And when I do ‘Superstition,' do I still want to get that groove in?”
Only Wonder knows the answers of course.
Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Tony Bennett was among Wonder's guests at Sunday's concert. Tony Bennett was among Wonder's guests at Sunday's concert. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)
But you had to admire the thoughtfulness of their approach, especially now that live performances of classic albums, from the Beach Boys' “Pet Sounds” to U2's “The Joshua Tree,” have become common catnip for fans more interested in nostalgia than investigation. (Indeed, Sunday's gig came four years after Wonder did their “Songs in the Key of Life” at 2013's House Full of Toys benefit.)
Ditto the singer's commitment to realizing the rhythmic, textural and harmonic sophistication of their early-'70s music, which found them breaking away from the crisp R&B formalism of their youth to embrace the flowing melodies and open-ended structures — and the political activism — of songs like “You and I” and “He's Misstra Know-It-All.”
At Staples they were backed by a large band led by Rickey Minor, complete with horn section, backing singers and several percussionists; original session players, including guitarist Ray Parker Jr., joined them at various points to reproduce their studio licks (even if a buggy sound system prevented some of them from being heard).
And though the crowd noticeably thinned as the clock ticked past midnight, Wonder stuck to the program, playing the songs in all their complicated, drawn-out glory rather than cutting them short in a race to the finish line.
The result stood out from many of the full-album concerts I've seen in that Wonder wasn't reimagining the material — they were deeply faithful to the old arrangements — but was singing and playing with atypical emotional urgency.
That went double in “Big Brother,” about opportunistic politicians, and the outraged “Living for the City,” with its lyrics about black struggle that Wonder practically growled through clenched teeth as they hammered their keyboard.
Much in America has changed since they released “Talking Book” and “Innversions,” Wonder seemed to be saying. And much else hasn't.

Jammu: With Leader of Opposition in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly Omar Abdullah drawing a parallel between the PDP-BJP alliance and the "deal with the devil", Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Friday said they can accept going to hell to save Kashmir.
During their address, Abdullah narrated the story of Faust and Satan - the pact between a person and Satan or a lesser demon in which the person offers their or their soul in exchange for diabolical favours and said today's situation reminds them of the story.
Abdullah on Friday demanded the constitution of a high-level special investigation team (SIT) to probe the killings of three people in firing by security forces when a convoy was attacked by stone-pelters in Shopian district.
"You (Mehbooba) have also entered into such a trade politically for six years of rule. They (BJP) gave you full six years of rule with respect, dignity, honour, with a design to take away your political soul," Omar said.
The former CM said the end of this story depends upon you. In case, they (Mehbooba) wants to save themselves from the fire of hell (as per the story), then it better to take corrective measures.
"You undertake prayers like Faust, bring change in the governance of this state so that you can restore your political soul and save yourself from fire of hell," they said.
Responding to Omar's comments, Mufti said they don't believe in mythology and stories.
"Now, they (Omar) has left by giving me fatwa of going to hell but I feel that God has given us the paradise - the paradise of Kashmir," Mehbooba told the Assembly after Omar had left the House.
They said, "I can accept going to hell a hundred times to save this paradise. I will be happy to do that if I can be able to bring people out of this hell here. It will not be a big price for me to pay."
Mehbooba, who was replying to a discussion on the budgetary demands of the home department, said they can sacrifice themselves if people of Jammu and Kashmir could get rid of their agony and pain.
They said it was the mission of former chief minister and their father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to pull the people of the state out of the vicious circle of violence.
Omar blamed Mehbooba Mufti for selling people with dreams of self rule, dual currency, joint mechanism of legislative body of both sides of Kashmir.
"But what you said here that whatever people of Jammu and Kashmir will get, can be from the Constitution of India and will get nothing outside that," they said.
Mehbooba Mufti said that BJP is biggest and strongest party of the country and it is not a weak one.
"We should not insult people who have chosen them (BJP and its alliance partners)to rule the country", they said while taking a dig at Omar's remarks.
Reacting to Abdullah's remarks, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh said, "He (Omar) is adding fuel to the fire with their remarks. They have targeted security forces. They have tried to create polarisation between Kashmir and rest of India."
The deputy chief minister said they had high respect for Abdullah but lost it on Friday.
Top singles player Yuki Bhambri on Monday returned to the Indian Davis Cup team along with Saketh Myneni even as veteran Leander Paes was expectedly dropped from the squad for the tie against Canada next month.Apart from Bhambri and Myneni, Ramkumar Ramanathan and Rohan Bopanna made the squad, captained by Mahesh Bhupathi. Filling in the reserves slots were Prajnesh Gunneswaran and N Sriram Balaji.The 44-year-old Paes was included in the six-man squad for the previous tie against Uzbekistan in Bengaluru in April this year but was left out of the final four by the new captain Mahesh Bhupathi.Upset and embarrassed, Paes had left the venue mid-way into the tie, prompting Bhupathi to reveal on Facebook that they had never promised Paes a spot in the final four and that their departure was final nail in the coffin.Both Bhambri, who recently beat world number 22 Gael Monfils, and Myneni had missed the Uzbekistan tie due to their respective injuries. Now that they are back on the ATP Tour, they will take their places back in the side for the September 15-17 tie in Edmonton. Ramkumar Ramanathan who created a ripple by beating world number eight Dominic Thiem will be the other singles player in the team.Bopanna being the highest-ranked doubles player in the country is automatic choice for the doubles rubber. Paes needs one more win to claim the world record for most Davis Cup wins in doubles.  They are tied on 42 wins with Italian legend Nicola Pietrangeli.
The coordinator of the women's national team for USA Gymnastics has stepped down, the latest departure to rock the embattled organization in the wake of a sexual abuse scandal centered on former team doctor Larry Nassar.
Valeri Liukin said Friday they were stepping down after taking over for Martha Karolyi in September 2016.
Liukin said in a statement that while they wanted to help turn the program around, “the present climate causes me, and more importantly my family, far too much stress, difficulty and uncertainty.”
USA Gymnastics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its board of directors stepped down earlier this week under pressure from the United States Olympic Committee.
The USOC announced Friday it hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation into decades-long abuse by Nassar, a longtime doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University who is awaiting sentencing for assault charges against athletes at a Michigan gym. Nassar has already been sentenced to up to 175 years in prison on similar charges in a separate case completed last week and was previously sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.
Liukin, a four-time Olympic medalist while competing for the Soviet Union, is the father of 2008 Olympic all-around champion Nastia Liukin.  They are the longtime owner of World Olympic Gymnastics Academy in Texas and served as the elite development coordinator for USA Gymnastics from 2013 until taking over for Karolyi shortly after the 2016 Olympics.
Liukin says it's time for them to move in a different direction right now, but they will still support and encourage athletes and coaches from a different vantage point.

FORD HAS MY VOTE
What an opportunity for the Conservatives and more importantly for the people in the province of Ontario. My choice for leader would be Doug Ford, who has the abilities and most importantly relates to the people, the taxpayer, the bill payers, and their struggles from the aftermath of the Liberal government. The remote areas of Ontario have always been Conservative but the Liberals strength has been in the GTA. Ford will carry thousands of votes and has an opportunity to turn Liberal seats into Conservative seats. Let's talk and let's support a guy who can do the job and clean the swamp.

TRUDEAU'S ARROGANCE
Our prime minister states that veterans want more than Canada can afford (“PM hit with tough questions at town hall,” Canadian Press, Feb. 2). What breath-taking arrogance. How about funding veterans before throwing money at Trudeau's left-wing “progressive” agenda? Justin certainly wants more than Canada can afford.

NOT A FAN
With an endless supply of politically engaged articles and comments, I become less and less of a fan of the people we allow to represent our province and our country. At an earlier point in time, a “ruler” may have been defined as a person who had the capabilities and virtues beyond those they led. In this country today, we no longer hold our expectations at a high enough point, as we expect nothing more than a degree or a slight amount of political and economical knowledge to be eligible to run our country. As a student, I strive for these expectations to be risen in both myself and my peers, so the future of our public policy and political strategies are far beyond those we see today.

STOP BEING SO BORING

WHAT A WASTE
So, looks like the Canadian government is about to remove “thy sons” from our anthem to be gender neutral. When will the word “his tory” (history) be changed to “ustory.” All that time and money wasted debating this when the Senate and prime minister could have actually been getting Canadian veterans the compensation they deserve and are entitled to to help them move forward with their injuries and pensions to live the rest of their lives after selfless service to you and me!

LAHORE - Pakistan Awami Tehreek chief Dr Tahirul Qadri has condemned the Lahore suicide attack and said it has once again exposed the Punjab government's security plans.
In a statement issued from PAT head office Model Town yesterday, they said that the incident was the outcome of government's inaction against sleeping cells in Punjab and its failure to implement National Action Plan in letter and spirit. They said the government should be held accountable for not getting benefits from the Operation Zarb-i-Azb. They said the delay in extending the term of military courts had put a question mark over the intent of the government in the terror war, asking what alternative the government has other than the summary courts for speedy trial of terrorists. They said it had proved now the facilitators of terrorists were in power corridors, adding no action against sleeping cells in Punjab and not making public the Qazi Essa Report had lent credence to the fact.
Dr Qadri said that terrorist struck The Mall now but the fact was that they had hit all big markets, bazaar, mosques, parks and offices of security forces in the past. Banning protests on The Mall will serve no purpose, they said, adding solution to the problem lies in the change in the mindset of those calling the shots. They reiterated that the Qazi Essa Report was an eye opener not only for the general public bust also for the departments concerned.
Praying and expressing sympathies with the families of the victims of the blast, they said that terrorists would continue striking innocent people until their facilitators and sympathizers were not taken to task. They said the Model Town incident was a test case in this regard. They said if operations were carried out in Karachi and Quetta, why Lahore was an exception.
They also questioned the justification for not starting an operation in the Punjab. They said Punjab ministers warned the protesting druggists against potential terror attack but they had not taken them on board while passing the bill.
A Muslim aerospace engineer has sued the Spirit Boeing Employees Association for religious discrimination stemming from a party at a lake in Wichita, Kansas.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Friday on behalf of Munir Zanial, a Malaysian national of Indian ancestry.
The association declined to comment.
Zanial rented the group's lake last year to host a party to celebrate Malaysian Independence Day. The lawsuit alleges the association reported them out of fear they used the lake to hold a Daesh meeting.
It alleged an American flag that had been "desecrated Daesh symbols." But the flag was actually a Malaysian flag and the guests included people of Malaysian Indian ancestry, some wearing hijabs.
Spirit filed a complaint with the FBI, and the association terminated their rental benefits.
With filming for the first season of NBC's breakout drama “This Is Us” done-and-dusted, actor Mandy Moore hopped a flight to New York to catch a few fashion shows and try to restore some sense of normality.
The Golden Globe-nominated actor' career has accelerated in recent months due to their role as “Rebecca,” a blindingly frank mother of three, in the popular series that has a non-linear narrative. With events in the characters' lives transpiring out-of-order, viewers inevitably have questions not only about the timeline, but also the progression of their own lives.
Before Lela Rose's luncheon and fashion show at Loring Place Monday, Moore talked about how the show's undercurrent of time is playing out in others' lives. “What we're doing is inherently about family. I hope that people are able to watch the show and identify bits and pieces of themselves, and the challenges and obstacles that they face. I know it's helped people at least to start to have conversations that maybe they wouldn't necessarily have,” they said. “That kind of speaks to the power of the medium of television and film.”
As much as they like “being part of something that feels important and timely,” Moore said, “just being part of something that feels hopeful in this day's and age” makes them feel very proud. As one of the more visible celebrity supporters of last month's Women's March, Moore said they are looking to their peers to see what the next steps are. Having first found fame as musician, they were part of the celebrity-studded “Fight Song” that aired at last summer's Democratic National Committee.
“I think all of us don't really have a choice to sit back. We can't be political any more. We don't have a choice. We don't have the option necessarily,” Moore said. “It's our duty to step up and keep ourselves as informed and educated as we can stand to be. Because sometimes it's easier to stick your head in the sand. So I'm trying day-by-day to put one foot in front of the other.”
Having appeared as “Rapunzel” in the 2010 film “Tangled,” Moore will also be part of the series by the same name that makes its debut on the Disney Channel on March 10. (“This Is Us” creator Dan Fogelman also wrote the movie “Tangled.”) Even though they grew up in Orlando, their ties to Disney were previously zilch. “It is so much fun. I feel like a little piece of that character lives inside of me — their spunk and their zest for life and their sense for adventure and fearlessness. I get to sing and be reunited with everybody that I worked with on the film.”
Them singing career took off at the age of 14, thanks to a FedEx driver who heard them in a Florida studio and later shared their music with a friend at A&R at Epic Records. “I am very grateful to them for jump-starting my career‚ for sure,” they said.
Taking a breather from the time travel that their role on “This Is Us” requires, Moore, whose divorce from Ryan Adams was finalized in June, was very much in the present Monday. “We just wrapped the show Friday and I'm trying to find some sense for normalcy again. I just came here immediately to be with my friends. We're going to have a little bit of a girls' week, take in some fashion shows [Marchesa, Marc Jacobs and Naeem Khan] and eat good food.”

A young Palestinian man who was waving a Turkish flag during protests along the Gaza Strip border against Israel's decades-long occupation was shot Tuesday by Israeli soldiers, Anadolu Agency correspondents reported from the scene.
Despite their injury, the Palestinian man continued to hold the Turkish flag while they were being transferred by medical staff to the ambulance.
The man was shot in the foot and is currently undergoing treatment.
During the "return march", many young people have raised the Turkish flag and held pictures of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a show of their support and love for Turkey.
The shooting came as hundreds of Palestinian women converged along the Gaza-Israel security fence to take part in ongoing demonstrations, marking their first mass mobilization since protests erupted on the border three months ago.
Women arrived in buses from across the enclave, many accompanied by their children, AFP correspondents said.
In a statement, the women's committee of Gaza's National Authority for Breaking the Siege called on Palestinian women to take part in the rallies, which first began on March 30.
"We are demonstrating today for a just cause: to end the years-long blockade of Gaza and return to our land that has been stolen by Israel," committee member Iktimal Hamad told Anadolu Agency.
"Palestinian women have paid dearly for Palestine," they added. "We will not give up our land or our legitimate rights."
"I came to finish the march that my daughter had started," Rim Abu Irmana said, waving a picture of their 15-year-old daughter, Wasal, who was killed by Israeli gunfire on May 14.
"These demonstrations are peaceful. We are only defending our land and our rights," added the 43-year-old, holding the hand of their young son.
Meanwhile, Palestinian Health Ministry spokesperson said some 134 people were injured during the demonstrations.
Ashraf al-Qidra said: "134 Palestinians were injured and affected by gas due to the Israeli army's intervention on a women's march on the eastern Gaza border."
Since the rallies in Gaza first began more than three months ago, at least 138 Palestinian demonstrators have been killed -- and thousands more injured -- by Israeli army gunfire.
No Israelis have been killed.
Palestinians demand the "right of return" to their homes and villages in historical Palestine from which they were driven in 1948 to make way for the new state of Israel.
They also demand an end to the 11-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has gutted the coastal enclave's economy and deprived its two million inhabitants of many basic commodities.

The appeal was filed by Padrón before the Contentious Electoral Court (TCE), in accordance with Section 269 of the Democracy Code, said a statement issued by the CREO-SUMA Alliance.
This party considers that the count of 11.2% of the total votes, set for tomorrow by the CNE is a show. This percentage corresponds to 1'275,450 votes.
“The CNE stated nothing about the anomalies found in more than 31,000 votes tally sheets, whose white votes represented less than three votes per sheet, nor on the irregularities of the entire system whose totals do not add up,” the statement said.
Oil on Wednesday, May 30, dipped towards $75 a barrel, under pressure from expectations OPEC and its allies will pump more and as Italy's political crisis increased investors' aversion to risk.
Global benchmark Brent crude has dropped $5 from a 3 1/2-year high of $80.50 a barrel on May 17, after reports that OPEC and Russia may increase supply at a June meeting, reversing policy after 17 months of cutting supplies.
Brent LCOc1 was down 3 cents at $75.36 a barrel by 0842 GMT, after trading as low as $74.81 earlier. U.S. crude CLc1 was up 3 cents at $66.76.
“Take the specter of rising production from OPEC/non-OPEC and throw in a generous sprinkling of eurozone political turmoil and what do you get? In short, an exodus of oil bulls,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.
“A dearth of bullish catalysts will make hard work of any recovery.”
Political turmoil in Italy has rocked financial markets, sending the euro to a 10-month low against the dollar on concern that a snap election would lead to a eurosceptic government in Rome.
A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies and tends to weigh on oil prices.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have had a pact to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day since January 2017. The cutbacks have largely removed excess global inventories.
Amid concerns the price rally has gone too far, Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil output by around 1 million bpd, sources told Reuters on May 25. OPEC meets in Vienna on June 22.
Still, some analysts sounded a note of caution as the details have yet to be worked out. Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates meet this weekend, a source said.
“The nature and magnitude of this effort – if it materializes – is not straightforward,” said JBC Energy. “Clarity will likely take some time to emerge, though there is an outside chance that more will be known by the end of the week.”
Lending some support to prices were expectations that U.S. crude inventories probably fell by 1.8 million barrels last week according to a Reuters poll.

A day after a group of French tourists were assaulted in Uttar Pradesh's Mirzapur, five more accused were arrested on Monday and sent to prison, taking to eight the total number of people arrested for the crime.
A local court sent the accused to 14 days judicial custody. A senior Mirzapur police official that Varanasi resident Riya Dutta had come to visit Lakhania Dari along with their family members and some foreigner friends on Sunday when a group of youngsters from Varanasi misbehaved with them. When the family resisted, they were assaulted and beaten up.
The police official further said that when the foreign tourists, still seated in the car, came out and tried to restore calm, they were also assaulted but sustained no injuries. Officials also said that the statement of the French nationals that they were not beaten up has been video recorded and preserved for future probe.
A probe has also been ordered by the district police as to where were the PAC troopers and local police officers at the time of the incident as they should have been there at the tourist spot. Additional SP, A.K. Singh will conduct the enquiry.

WILKES-BARRE — The mother of a 4-year-old boy who broke their leg after falling from the second-floor window of a Wilkes-Barre Housing Authority property filed suit Monday alleging the authority failed to provide safe housing.
Triana Ferguson alleges that their son, DeMarco Ferguson, was in a second-floor bedroom of their home at 135 S. Welles St. the afternoon of Oct. 29 when they opened a window and fell out through a broken screen.
The complaint, filed by Kingston attorneys David J. Selingo and David W. Saba, says the boy suffered “serious and permanent injuries, including, but not limited to, fracture of the right femur/hip, which caused them to undergo great physical pain and mental anguish.”
The lawsuit alleges that the authority should have known about the dangerous condition the windows presented but failed to install safety devices that would have protected the children living in the home.
The authority also failed to warn the tenants about the safety issues associated with the windows and failed to repair the screens, according to the complaint.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in addition to the costs of the lawsuit.
A message left after hours with the authority on Monday was not immediately returned.

Artificial intelligence (AI) may not be ready to write the next blockbuster movie, but a team of AI researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Media Lab successfully used machine learning to teach computers about emotional arcs in movies.
The researchers, which collaborated for this project with McKinsey, used machine learning to analyze thousands of videos, including movies, TV shows and short films found on Vimeo. “We developed machine-learning models that rely on deep neural networks to ‘watch' small slices of video—movies, TV, and short online features—and estimate their positive or negative emotional content by the second,” the team wrote in a blog post Monday morning.
The approach didn't just pay attention to the general plot line of a movie, but also to more subtle aspects, including the score, and close-ups of a person's face. Using these clues, the project's machine learning algorithms were able to identify positive and negative emotions, and map out the extent to which each scene would provoke emotional responses — something the researchers called “visual valence.”
Taken together, this would result in a movie's or video's emotional arc — as shown below for the opening scene of Pixar's “Up:”
In other words: Just by analyzing the visual elements of a movie, the algorithms could detect where the tear jerkers would be, and how the overall emotional arc of a story would develop. Researchers also used a control group of human volunteers to map out their response to some of the movies analyzed by computers, and then used that data to refine their models.
By comparing all of the emotional arcs analyzed by their AI, researchers found that most movies and short films follow simple formulas for their emotional arc. They also compared how audiences responded to each of these formulas by looking at comments left on 1500 short films on Vimeo — only to find that even Vimeo viewers like happy endings.
That in itself ma not be that surprising — but the fact that artificial intelligence can be used to analyze the emotional arc of a movie, and with that predict an audience response, could be profound for Hollywood, the researchers argued.
“As storytellers increasingly realize the value of AI, and as these tools become more readily available, we could see a major change in the way video stories are created,” they wrote. “In the same way directors can now integrate motion capture in their work, writers and storyboarders might work alongside machines, using their capabilities to sharpen their stories and amplify their emotional pull.”

On a green hillside outside Rome, something strange is happening. Cracks in the ground begin to emit steam, and animals drop dead due to asphyxiation. Deep beneath the ground, an earthquake starts to rumble. Is this great city doomed to a terrible fate?
Some 12 miles southeast of Rome, a semicircular formation of hills stretches for nine miles across the Italian landscape. Known as the Alban Hills – or Colli Albani – they have been the site of human settlements all the way back to prehistoric times.
ADVERTISEMENT
Beginning in the 9th century BC, villages began to spring up in the area, including Alba Longa – home to Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. Then, as ancient Rome grew in power, the area became a popular retreat for citizens looking to escape the city.

DEAR ABBY >> My husband and I have been together for 40 years. Like most people, weve had our good times and bad, but weve both been committed to the marriage, and so weve made it work.
Now Im faced with a problem for which I see no solution. My husband refuses to learn to use a computer. They know nothing about computers, not even how to turn one on!
As you know, computers are now key to even the most fundamental tasks. That means, as the only computer user in the house, all tasks are MY responsibility. Banking, bill paying, communication with family, friends, lawyers, financial advisers, arrangements for social events, business meetings, medical appointments, travel and other activities are totally up to me. They do NONE of it! They wash the dishes and takes out the trash, but any function that requires brains and technology are totally left to me.
Im tired! Is this fair? Ive asked many times for them to go to our public library and take lessons on computer use, but they adamantly refuse. How do I handle this?

DEAR ALL ON YOU >> After 40 years you are not going to change your husband, so appreciate the things they do do. I know youre tired and it may not seem fair, but grit your teeth and forge ahead.
You have no idea how lucky you really are. Many wives know little or nothing about the family finances. If something unforeseen happens to their husbands, they are left scrambling to learn about realities for which they are not equipped.
P.S. Consider asking your husband what they would do in the case of YOUR sudden death. He, too, would be left completely adrift. It couldnt hurt to warn him.
DEAR ABBY >> I am a widow, and I often dine out with my youngest son. Invariably, because I have a 25-year-old man with me and no husband, we are shown to an undesirable table in the restaurant. Usually, I say nothing.
This evening, we were escorted to a room way in the back of a large restaurant (two-thirds full). The only other occupants were a couple with two small children who looked to be about 2 or 3. When I requested a different table, my son was furious. They said what I had done was rude.
We were moved to another table. It was between the hostess station and the kitchen door. I sat there and said nothing. This was an expensive restaurant, and our bill was more than $100. Was I rude? I would appreciate your opinion.
 New Seat in Florida
DEAR NEW SEAT >> Your son was mistaken. To ask to be seated at a table in a different part of the restaurant was not rude; it was your prerogative. If you preferred a location in the front of the place rather than near the kitchen or a family with small children, you should have repeated your request. And if the host or hostess had a problem with it, you should have left and enjoyed dinner at a restaurant more accommodating than that one.

Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Sunday donated $100,000 to help a Los Angeles-based group's effort to fight hate, saying they were “horrified” by anti-Semitic and racist protests in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend.
“While these so-called ‘white nationalists' are lucky to live in a country that defends their right to voice their awful, incorrect, hateful opinions, the rest of us must use our voices and resources to condemn hate and teach tolerance at every opportunity,” they wrote on Facebook Sunday. “My message to them is simple: you will not win. Our voices are louder and stronger.”
Schwarzenegger announced the donation to the Simon Wiesenthal Center as President Trump was under fire for failing to quickly speak out against the racist and anti-Semitic protests that resulted in three deaths.
After two days of bipartisan criticism, Trump on Monday delivered a new statement that explicitly condemned white supremacists, Nazis and KKK members for the violence that shook the sleepy Virginia college town over the weekend.
Schwarzenegger and Trump have a long-simmering feud, but the former governor did not mention the president in their statement.
They also urged others to donate to anti-hate groups.
Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Wiesenthal Center, said Schwarzenegger had been a supporter of the organization for more than 30 years.
“We've never been prouder of their leadership than when we saw their tweet last night challenging everyone to do more in the fight against hate,” Hier said.
Video broadcast on several Canadian outlets showed police arresting the driver, dressed in dark clothes, after officers surrounded them and their rental Ryder van several blocks from where the vehicle jumped the curb in the North York neighborhood of northern Toronto. They appeared to make some sort of gesture at the police with an object in their hand just before they ordered them to lie down on the ground and took them away.
They may have had to strip to their swimming trunks to be recognised in central London, but Olympic champion Adam Peaty is determined to build on their success in 2017 and beyond.
Peaty on Wednesday afternoon was photographed near Trafalgar Square, their sculpted physique attracting glances from tourists and commuters alike.
And it provided a clue which their new neighbour did not have when the 22-year-old moved to their own home near Loughborough after claiming Great Britain's first medal of last August's Rio Olympics, with gold in the men's 100metres breaststroke.
Peaty, speaking at an arena swimwear event to launch their 'Instinct' signature collection, told Press Association Sport: "I think it makes it a little bit easier for people to catch on.
"For a lot of people, when they see you on TV, they don't put two and two together. My neighbour, when I first moved in, was like, 'Are you a footballer?' I was like, 'Definitely not, mate'.
"He said, 'Ah, I recognise you'. 'I'm a swimmer'. 'Ah, no way, you're Adam Peaty'."
Peaty, Britain's first male Olympic swimming champion in 28 years, is comfortable with the attention which accompanies a sport which is on the up in Britain.
And the Uttoxeter swimmer's golden exploits in Rio have left them eager for more success in the water.
They added: "It hasn't really changed me, my beliefs, my core values. I'm still striving for the same thing and that's legacy. I want to be the best ever on breaststroke. That's been me from day one."
Peaty is happy to show off their ripped torso, having posed coming out of the Brazilian surf and recently for Attitude magazine.
"I just love doing stuff like that. It's really, really cool," they added.
Peaty's objectives for 2017 are to retain their 50m and 100m breaststroke world titles at July's World Championships in Budapest.
Britain will also seek to defend the 4x100m mixed medley relay title won in Kazan in 2015, when Peaty swam the breaststroke leg. The event is to be added to the Olympic programme for Tokyo 2020.
Peaty said: "I've just got to be on it, overcome any challenge that I face and do what I do: swim two lengths as fast as I can."

Home improvement company Lowe's followed Home Depot in announcing Friday it will offer its employees one-time bonuses of up to $1,000 as a result of President Donald Trump's tax reform legislation.
Bonuses will be paid to Lowe's 260,000 employees, according to a press release from the company.
Locally, Lowe's has stores in Wilkes-Barre Twp., Edwardsville, Dickson City and West Hazleton and a distribution center in CenterPoint Commerce and Trade Park East in Jenkins Twp.
Lowe's will award the one-time cash bonuses to eligible full-time and part-time hourly employees across all its U.S. facilities including stores, customer support centers, contact centers and distribution centers.
According to national news reports, full-time employees who have worked for Lowe's for 20 years or more will receive $1,000.
The remaining employees will be paid on a sliding scale based on their length of time working for the company.
Lowe's also announced plans to enhance benefits, including expanded maternity and parental leave as well as adoption assistance.
“We are investing in our employees who make a difference every day in the communities where we live and work,” Robert A. Niblock, Lowe's chairperson, president and CEO, said in a statement. “Our employees are the foundation of our business and we are excited to enhance our benefits to better meet their needs and the needs of their families.”
Niblock added that the announcement is another example of “how we will continue to invest in our employee and customer experience as we continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform.”
In addition to the company's comprehensive benefits program, eligible full-time hourly and salaried U.S. employees will qualify to receive 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and two weeks of paid parental leave, an adoption assistance benefit to cover up to $5,000 of expenses related to agency, legal and other fees.
Employees also will be eligible to enroll in health benefits sooner, as early as the first of the month following 30 days of service.
The enhancements follow the company's recent announcement that it will recruit more than 53,000 seasonal associates nationwide.

A spokesperson for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV declined to comment on a media report suggesting the automaker had been targeted for purchase by a Chinese company.
Automotive News reported Monday morning: “Representatives of a well-known Chinese automaker made at least one offer this month to buy Fiat Chrysler Automobiles at a small premium over its market value... The offer was rejected for not being enough, a source said.”
Sergio Marchionne, FCA's chief executive officer, has repeatedly floated the idea of mergers in the past with other automakers, including General Motors.
But on Monday, FCA's U.S. spokesperson Shawn Morgan offered little on the report.
“We are declining to comment,” they said in an emailed response to questions.

The chief executive of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. publicly resigned from a White House manufacturing council on Monday, declaring they felt “a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”
The move by Kenneth Frazier, one of corporate America's leading African American executives, came after President Trump was criticized for not explicitly condemning white supremacists after violent clashes with counter-protestors turned deadly in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.
Trump quickly lashed out at Frazier on Twitter.
“Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, they will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” Trump wrote less than an hour after Merck posted Frazier's statement on Twitter.
Frazier was among more than two dozen corporate executives and union officials advising the Trump administration on boosting American manufacturing.
But after Trump's comments in the wake of the deadly Charlottesville protest, blaming the violence “on many sides” without specifically denouncing the white nationalists who were at the center of the clashes, Merck posted a statement on Twitter from Frazier announcing their resignation from the council.
“America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,” Frazier said.
“As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” they said.

Many on Twitter noted that Trump responded more quickly and specifically to Frazier's resignation than they did to the violence in Charlottesville.

In its bid to sensitise more Nigerians on the need to fully participate in the electoral process, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Oyo State, on Friday took its awareness campaign to Oja-Oba Central Mosque in Ibadan.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Mutiu Agboke, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Oyo State, led other staff of the commission to the mosque during the Jumat service.
Agboke urged the Muslim faithful who were yet to register for the Permanent Voter Card (PVC) to use the opportunity of the ongoing Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) to register.
They also called on those who had registered in the past but abandoned their PVCs with INEC to endeavour to collect them.
”PVC is the only power that every Nigerian of voting age has to determine who governs them.
”Nigerians must shun voting apathy and participate fully in all election processes so that our democracy can grow,'' they said.
The REC assured the people of the state that the commission would be fair to all and conduct credible elections in 2019.

LOS ANGELES (AP) Shonda Rhimes, the creator of popular television series such as “Scandal” and “Grey's Anatomy,” has signed a deal to make new shows for Netflix.
The streaming service announced late Sunday that Rhimes' Shondaland production company is moving to Netflix. Netflix wrote in a news release that Rhimes' shows “Grey's Anatomy,” “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder” would continue to air on ABC.
Rhimes wrote in a statement that they were grateful to the network for giving their career a start, but they were looking forward to expanding their audience and “creative identity” with Netflix. “Starting today, we are thrilled to begin creating new Shondaland stories with Netflix,” they wrote.
They wrote that they and Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos had developed a plan for the next phase of Rhimes' career. They said Netflix offered them and their team “limitless possibilities.”
“I've gotten the chance to know Shonda and she's a true Netflixer at heart – they love TV and films, they care passionately about their work, and they deliver for their audience,” Sarandos wrote.
No financial terms of the deal were disclosed. The news release also didn't state how long Rhimes and their company would produce series for Netflix.
Rhimes, 47, has been nominated for three Emmy Awards, all for their work on “Grey's Anatomy.” The long-running series begins its 14th season next month.
A police officer with the regional Integrated Road Safety Unit was knocked down by a pickup truck with a trailer while they were at the intersection of 200 Street and Fraser Highway looking for distracted drivers using cell phones. The officer's injuries were said to be relatively minor. Dan Ferguson Langley Times
A police officer hunting for distracted drivers was hit by a pickup truck Monday afternoon in the Lower Mainland.
The officer was said to be a member of the Integrated Road Safety Unit who was looking for drivers using cell phones at a busy intersection in Langley.
Police at the scene said the officer was walking in traffic just before they were hit.
One witness said it appeared the officer “got caught” on the back of the truck's trailer as it was passing by, and it pulled them to the ground.
It did not appear that the truck driver was using their phone.
The officer was taken to hospital with minor injuries as a precaution.

When most people think back on the child celebrities of their time, they likely think of child movie actors, the well-trained stars of showbiz. For some, these were stars like Mary Kate and Ashley Olson, or Macaulay Carson Culkin from Home Alone. For others, they were Judy Garland or Shirley Temple.
For kids these days, however, some of the biggest stars are not actors at all but YouTube stars.
And one of the biggest of them all is a six-year-old named Ryan who plays with toys - mesmerizing millions of children across the globe.
Since they were three years old, Ryans parents have been capturing videos of them opening toys, playing with them and reviewing them for videos posted on their YouTube channel, Ryan ToysReview. (Continued below)

Ryans last name, and their place of residence are a closely guarded secret, and not without reason.
Ryan has become a multi-millionaire, according to Forbes magazines just-out list of highest paid YouTube entrepreneurs. They were ranked number eight, having brought in $11 million in revenue between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2017, before management fees and taxes, of course. They tied with the comedy channel Smosh, created by Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox.
Children everywhere have become hooked, watching their videos for hours a day, even mimicking them and starting their own YouTube channels. For some of their youngest fans, Ryan is not just some stranger on the internet.  They are their friend.
Combined, the worlds 10 highest-paid YouTube stars earned $127 million, up 80% from last year. According to Forbes, this boost came thanks to ad dollars from a surge in views - including a healthy sum from Ryan ToysReview. During the 12 months considered by Forbes, Ryan ToysReview counted over 8 billion views.
What has grown into a viral phenomenon began with a simple, unremarkable 15-minute video about a Lego Duplo train set. When their family started recording and posting the videos in March 2015, the 3-year-old barely had any views let alone reviews, according to a profile of Ryan in Verge. In their first video, they simply opened a Lego box, set up the blocks, and played with them.
Ryan was watching a lot of toy review channels - some of their favorites are EvanTubeHD and Hulyan Maya - because they used to make a lot of videos about Thomas The Tank Engine, and Ryan was super into Thomas, their mother, who declined to be named, told TubeFilter last year.
One day, they asked me, How come Im not on YouTube when all the other kids are? So we just decided - yeah, we can do that. Then, we took them to the store to get their very first toy - I think it was a lego train set - and it all started from there.
Soon the boy started playing with not just one toy at a time, but two, and then dozens. About four months in, their channel saw an explosion of traffic, driven primarily by a viral video of Ryan reviewing a hundred toys at once. It is titled 100+ cars toys GIANT EGG SURPRISE OPENING Disney Pixar Lightning McQueen kids video Ryan ToysReview
Ryan ToysReview took off. Views started doubling every month. In January of 2016, they hit 1 million subscribers. A year later, they had more than 5 million. Now, hes at more than 10 million subscribers and over 16 million views.
In June, TubeFilter ranked Ryan ToysReview as the most viewed YouTube channel in the U.S. for the 40th week in a row. In September, NBA player Kevin Durant was featured in one of Ryans videos performing a childrens science experiment.
Ryans popularity makes perfect sense. Hes got every small kids dream job, opening toys and playing with them, day after day. Hes smiley, too, totally non-threatening to parents and children alike. No bad words. No preachy banter. Hes a miniature Mister Rogers but without the sweater and slippers.
In their most popular video, published April 13, 2016, Ryans mother films them as they crawl through an inflatable water slide, searching for giant Easter eggs. They crack open each one to find various toys inside.
Its lighting McQueen! they say excitedly as they open one to find a toy car from the Disney movie Cars. And wow, in another theres a character from Paw Patrol, in another, theres Spider-Man.
I bet theres a bad guy in there, they say, gesturing at one of the uncracked eggs. Who do you think it is, kids?
They spend much of the rest of the video tossing the toys down the water slide, playing with them in an inflatable pool.
Ryans got great timing too. They specialize in the slow reveal, like the opening of those eggs, and in surprise.
Of their 30 most popular videos, more than half include the word SURPRISE in all caps in the titles: GIANT EGG SURPRISE, HUGE EGGS SURPRISE TOYS CHALLENGE, BALLOON POP SURPRISE, SURPRISE TOYS Giant Ball Pit Challenge.
Theres no overthinking, no why is this toy better than another, no analysis, something adults describing Ryan ToysReview just cant resist.
The channel was described by Verge as a mash-up of personal vlog and unboxing video, a blend of innocent childhood antics and relentless, often overwhelming consumerism.
Unboxing refers to one of todays oddest and most lucrative genres on YouTube. The videos are exactly what they sound like: footage of people opening packages of newly purchased items, the latest Apple devices, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, as The Washington Posts Robin Givhan explained.
Each time someone clicks on one of Ryans videos, their family makes money. There are ads and links to ads all over the place.
Ryan has real impact.
If a product gets ten million, twenty millions views, and you see that Ryan loves it, or other kids love it, it has a huge impact at retail, Jim Silver, CEO of the review site Toys, Tots, Pets, and More, told the Verge when Ryan was still 5 years old. Hes really the youngest success that weve seen. Most of the time the kids were in the six-plus range, just because of the vocabulary and the maturity to do a review.
Their parents told TubeFilter in September of last year that 99 percent of the channels videos arent branded. At the time, the parents said they paid for all of the toys that Ryan reviewed. Its unclear how many toys they currently reviews are sent to them by sponsors, but their video descriptions often include dozens of links to name-brand items. According to their channels about page, the family donates most of the toys to charity after Ryan reviews them.
Many videos include Ryan doing things other than playing with toys. They show them going to get a haircut, playing hide and seek in a hotel, and attending their twin siblings birthday party.
We post a new video every day, and we typically film two to three videos at a time two to three times per week, their mom told TubeFilter. We try not to interfere with Ryans pre-pre-school schedule, so a majority of the filming takes place during the weekend, and then well edit while hes in school.
But even with just a few daily snippets of Ryans routine, their viewers can virtually insert themselves in their life. And for some young kids, the line is blurred between whats real and whats simply a part of Ryans videos.
My 5-year-old EATS THIS STUFF UP! one mother, Lindsay Weiss, wrote in a blog post titled Ryans Toy Review may be the death of me.
It is literally the only thing they watch on YouTube and the other day I caught them talking back to Ryan telling them they had missed an important feature in the new game Dont Wake Daddy.
Honey, you know Ryan cant hear you, right? Weiss said they told them son.
He doesnt need to hear me, Mama, their son responded, Weiss wrote. He just KNOWS.
I also have Ryan to thank for the THIRTEEN games my kiddo got for their birthday last week, Weiss added. Thats right. My kid got THIRTEEN games for their birthday. All courtesy of seeing Ryan play the games and squeal with delight.
Other parents have left scores of messages on Ryans YouTube channel, thanking them and their parents, saying their kids sometimes watch their videos for hours a day.
My son is autistic, one parent wrote. Your videos are helping them to speak, use their imagination, and properly use toys! They enjoy these videos several times a day and i would just love to say thank you!
hey Ryan ToysReview hi there, another parent wrote. my 3yr old kid Ashaz loves watching your videos.He wants to say hi n says you are their small brother lol. . .we are from India and best wishes from all of us.
Ryan, my boy loves your toys reviews, every day they watch your videos, one mother posted. Today they asked me mom, when we gonna visit Ryan?, I told them that is not possible because we live in different countries, maybe when you will grow :)
The greatest testament comes from the children themselves though.
hello ryan, one of them wrote recently. . . . i am 5 years old i am in my dads account how old are you also i love your videos.

New Delhi: In yet another twist in the race for Fortis Healthcare, IHH Healthcare Berhad on Tuesday made a binding offer to immediately infuse Rs 650 crore in the Indian firm as part of an overall proposal to invest Rs 4,000 crore.
The revised offer of the Malaysian firm comes two days ahead of a meeting of Fortis Healthcare Ltd (FHL) board to consider the recommendation by an expert advisory panel formed to finalise evaluation process of only binding offers.
IHH had earlier made a non-binding offer to invest Rs 4,000 crore in Fortis at Rs 160 per share.
Manipal-TPG combine and Munjals and Burmans were the only two groups which had made binding offers out of a total of five suitors in the race.
Chinese firm Fosun Health Holdings and KKR-backed Radiant Life Care had also made a non-binding expression of interests in FHL.
In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Fortis Healthcare said it has received an "unsolicited binding offer" from IHH Healthcare with a proposal to invest directly in the company.
In a letter to the board of directors of FHL, IHH Healthcare Berhad MD and Group CEO Tan See Leng said the binding proposal was for an immediate primary equity infusion of Rs 650 crore in FHL by way of a preferential issue and allotment of equity shares at Rs 160 per share.
IHH has also demanded the right to appoint two directors on the board of FHL.
The Malaysian firm, however, said its binding offer is subject to it being allowed to do due diligence and receipt of relevant regulatory approvals.
In their letter, Leng further said its non-binding offer would include an investment of Rs 3,350 crore through a subsequent preferential issue and allotment of equity shares subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence at a share price not exceeding Rs 160 apiece.
IHH said its revised offer would automatically withdraw on 4 May.
On Monday, Hero Enterprise Investment and the Burman family had announced an extension of the validity of their improved joint binding offer to invest Rs 1,500 crore in FHL till 4 May.
The development followed the FHL board forming an expert panel last week to evaluate binding offers and make the final recommendation by 26 April.
The advisory committee constituted by the Fortis board to oversee evaluation process and function as an advisor to the board is headed by Deepak Kapoor, former chairperson and CEO of Price Waterhouse Coopers, India.
The other members of the panel are Renuka Ramnath, former MD & CEO of ICICI Venture; and Lalit Bhasin, President, Society of Indian Law Firms & Managing Partner, Bhasin & Co.
On April 18, Hero Enterprise Investment Office and Burman Family Office improved their binding offer with a proposal to invest Rs 1,500 crore directly at a valuation of Rs 161.6 per share, from the earlier Rs 1,250 crore. They had stated that their improved offer was valid for five working days.
The Manipal/TPG-led consortium had raised their offer for Fortis to Rs 155 per share by valuing the hospital business higher at Rs 6,061 crore from Rs 5,003 crore in its initial offer on 27 March.
Fortis Healthcare had also received an unsolicited non-binding expression of interest from Fosun Health Holdings, an arm of Fosun International, with a proposal of primary infusion at a price up to Rs 156 per share up to a total investment of $350 million (over Rs 2,295 crore).
On the other hand, Radiant Life Care had offered to acquire at least 26 percent stake in Fortis at Rs 126 per share, excluding its diagnostic business SRL.
Shares of FHL on Tuesday ended 0.90 percent up at Rs 151.55 apiece on the BSE.

Real estate investment trust Hammerson (LSE: HMSO) confirmed in an announcement this morning that it received on 8 March a ?highly preliminary and non-binding proposal? from French shopping centre operator Klépierre SA regarding a possible £4.88bn cash and share offer. The directors at Hammerson rejected the approach. The proposal valued Hammerson at 615p per share — a premium of about 41% to its closing price on March 16 — and would have been settled with 50% cash and 50% with new Klépierre shares. The firm's shares shot up on the market?s opening bell and, as I write, sit at around…

Real estate investment trust Hammerson (LSE: HMSO) confirmed in an announcement this morning that it received on 8 March a “highly preliminary and non-binding proposal” from French shopping centre operator Klépierre SA regarding a possible £4.88bn cash and share offer. The directors at Hammerson rejected the approach.
The proposal valued Hammerson at 615p per share — a premium of about 41% to its closing price on March 16 — and would have been settled with 50% cash and 50% with new Klépierre shares. The firm's shares shot up on the market's opening bell and, as I write, sit at around 545p, still some 25% higher than Friday's closing price despite the firm saying no to the offer.
Value is in the eye of the beholder
Prior to today's news, Hammerson's share price had declined around 36% over the past two years and the directors said today that Klépierre's approach was “unsolicited and entirely opportunistic in its timing.” They say they unanimously threw out the proposal on the grounds that it “very significantly undervalues Hammerson, its track record of delivery, the quality of its portfolio, its market positions, and the opportunities it has for future value creation.”
I think the directors make a good point. The fact that the offer was at such a premium to the stock market's valuation of Hammerson means that Klépierre's directors saw greater value in the company. Now the stock market has woken up, which is why the shares are still 25% up even though the offer is a non-starter as far as Hammerson is concerned. Looking forward, maybe others will recognise Hammerson's value and we may even see better offers from either Klépierre or other companies down the line.
Meanwhile, Hammerson said it “remains fully committed” to the acquisition of Intu Properties, which it announced on 6 December. The aim is to combine two “high-quality portfolios” under Hammerson's management team. The directors think the Intu portfolio has many “large desirable high-footfall assets” and “a wealth of value-enhancing leasing and asset opportunities” that it can develop as well as realising around £25m in synergy savings annually.
Following the quality option
Chairman David Tyler seems clear that the best way forward is to be an acquirer rather than an acquiree. Their comments were scathing about Klépierre's move saying that as well as offering a price well below book value, the company was also asking shareholders to accept “a large element of paper in a company which in our view has a lower quality portfolio and lower growth prospects (than Hammerson's).”
So, should you pile into the shares now they are up 25% and ‘in play', so to speak? At first glance, the current valuation remains attractive. At the current share price around 545p, the discount to book value runs at 28% or so, and the forward dividend yield runs close to 5%. But Hammerson specialises in leasing retail properties and it's no secret how tough trading in the sector has been for many retail firms lately. I think that situation reflects in the share price weakness we've seen with Hammerson over the past couple of years. I'm happy to watch developments from the sidelines for now and will look for other stocks for my retirement portfolio.
Kolkata: Diego Maradona and modesty don't sit well together but the Argentine legend called themselves a "simple footballer" and not the god of football as their admirers watched, joyfully transfixed, their hand at self-deprecation.
"I am not the god of football but a simple footballer. I'm happy to be here in Kolkata again," Maradona said through their interpreter.
Their second visit in nine years may have been a low-key one unlike in 2008, but the legend still charmed a thousand-odd crowd at a charity event in a north Kolkata club this afternoon.
Maradona handed out cheques worth Rs 10,000 each to 11 cancer patients and flagged off an air-conditioned ambulance.
The club, which is famous for its lavish Durga Puja celebrations, was packed to the brim. Many were seen standing on rooftops of the adjoining buildings, making it an electrifying atmosphere.
They unveiled a 12-feet statue of them holding aloft the 1986 World Cup trophy and it would be erected at a park named after the name.
"It's amazing to have my statue here," the 1986 World Cup winner said.
Earlier, an audio-visual of the Argentine legend greeted them at the venue as Maradona arrived with their girlfriend.
Maradona was presented with a uttariyo (traditional scarf) on stage and a gold bracelet by the organisers.
The Argentine was originally slated to arrive on 19 September, but the trip got postponed several times.
Maradona will take on cricket icon Sourav Ganguly in an exhibition match titled 'Diego vs Dada' in Barasat, about 35 kilometres from the city.

RIYADH - Saudi Arabia has passed a new law to criminalise sexual harassment, state media said Wednesday, less than a month before the conservative kingdom lifts its decades-long ban on women driving.
The kingdom's Shura Council, which advises the cabinet, passed a draft law on Monday which would introduce a prison term of up to five years and a maximum penalty of 300,000 riyals ($80,000).
The law has been approved by the cabinet, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. It is “a very important addition to the history of regulations in the kingdom”, Shura Council member Latifa al-Shaalan was quoted as saying in an information ministry statement.
“It fills a large legislative vacuum, and it is a deterrent,” they added. The new law appears to be in preparation for the historic lifting of the kingdom's driving ban on women on June 24.
The move is part of a highly publicised liberalisation drive launched by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has also ended a decades-long ban on cinemas, allowed mixed-gender concerts and clipped the powers of the long-feared religious police.
But the social reforms appear overshadowed by the recent arrests of at least 11 activists, mostly identified by rights groups as veteran women campaigners for the right to drive and to end the conservative country's male guardianship system.
Without naming those detained, authorities have accused them of “suspicious contact with foreign parties”, providing financial support to “enemies” and attempting to undermine the kingdom's “security and stability”.
Reports in state-backed media branded some of the detainees traitors and “agents of embassies”.
At least four detained activists were released last week, campaigners including Amnesty International said, but the fate of the others remains unclear.
“Given the significant loosening of certain restrictions on women's activities in Saudi Arabia ... it is perplexing why both women and men engaged in campaigning for such positive developments are now being targeted by the authorities,” the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Tuesday.
“If, as it appears, their detention is related solely to their work as human rights defenders and activists on women's issues, they should be released immediately.”
Aside from the driving activists, authorities last week also arrested Mohammed al-Bajadi, co-founder of the Association for Civil and Political Rights (ACPRA), one of the few independent human rights groups in Saudi Arabia , campaigners said.
Human Rights Watch on Wednesday reported the arrest of a second rights activist, but added that they were subsequently released.
“The Saudi government seems so consumed with silencing dissent that even activists who have gone quiet for fear of retribution are being targeted again,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW.
Saudi officials have so far not responded to requests for comment on the crackdown.
Barely a year after they led some top managers of their Bank to Akure Government House to beg Ekiti State Governor ,Ayo Fayose over the treatment meted out to them by their bank, Zenith Bank has finally sacked it's Executive Director Mr Sola Oladipo .
Mr Sola Oladipo had on June 23rd 2016 led two zonal directors of the bank and the Ado-Ekiti branch manager of the Bank to Fayose to beg them on the embarrassment meted out to them by the Bank when the EFCC accused the Governor of using funds obtained from the office of the former NSA to bankroll their Governorship campaign
.
While, the Governor was having a chat with the delegation, the press was ushered into the room, where they captured the Bank Executives begging the governor on their knees.
The pictures of the drama were splashed all over the media, bringing a huge embarrassment to the foremost Bank.
The embarrassment caused the Bank by that unwholesome episode according to what CKN News gathered lingered till today.
A very reliable source who spoke to CKN News said the Executive Director was eased out of the system last week.
No one could give any reason for this latest development.
Mr Oladipo from what CKN News gathered was one of the two Executive Directors of the Bank appointed about two years ago and no one was expecting such a drop.
It is not known if their sack was as a result of the Ekiti incident or from other Managerial matters.
Protesters clash with govt forces in Sopore
Srinagar
Demonstrations were held in several parts of the valley on Friday against ‘granting' domicile' status to West Pakistan Refugees, a move the resistance leadership considers inimical to the interests of the majority Muslim community in the state.
The joint resistance leadership had asked the people to protest against issuing of domicile certificates to WPRs and a law (SARFAESI) that allows outside banks to seize properties and sell them to the highest bidder who can be a non-state subject. The law is seen as one more attempt to gnaw at the already eroded autonomy of the state.
A demonstration in this regard was held Nowhatta, where people shouted slogans against the state and demanded a halt on issuing domicile certificates to WPRs.
The state government has maintained that ‘identity certificates' not ‘domicile certificates' have been issued to the WPRs.
The demonstrators were also demanding release of all the political prisoners, including the local youths arrested over alleged stone-pelting.
The youth were also carrying posters mentioning the names of local youths who had been arrested by police during the past more than five months and were demanding their immediate release.
After being stopped by the forces, the peaceful demonstration morphed into a clash between the protesters and the forces. Teargas and slingshots were used by the police and paramilitary troopers to disperse the protesters.
Several people offering prayers inside Jamia Masjid who remained trapped for several minutes because of the clashes faced severe discomfort because of teargas.
Hurriyat Conference (M) chairperson Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was placed under house arrest and was not allowed to lead Friday prayers at mosque.
Intense clashes erupted between youths and government forces at Batamaloo area of Srinagar after Friday congregational prayers were over in local mosques.
Amid complete shutdown in Sopore town of north Kashmir's Baramulla district, youth held demonstrations and clashed with forces near Jamia Masjid road following the Friday prayers.
Witnesses said that soon after the Friday prayers, locals mainly youth assembled outside Jamia Masjid and amid heavy sloganeering, hurled rocks at the forces. They said that police and paramilitary troops retaliated with tear smoke shells and chilli grenades to disperse the protesters.
Following Friday prayers at Khankah Faiz Panah in south Kashmir's Tral town, people staged a protest demonstration against the government move to issue domicile certificates. Youth later hurled stones at forces deployment while as, later responded by firing teargas shells to scatter them.
Protest rallies were also taken out in Quimoo area of Kulgam district. Meanwhile, a complete shutdown was observed in all the major and small townships of south Kashmir in response to the shutdown call given by the joint resistance leadership.
Activists of JKLF organized a protest demonstration at Abiguzar, demanding immediate rollback of the government order. A similar protest demonstration was held by Tehreek-e-Hurriyat in Hyderpora area of Srinagar.—KR

The ADR advocates that no part of the Form 24A submitted by political parties providing details of donations above Rs 20,000 should be left blank and that full details of all donors should be made available for public scrutiny under the RTI.
"Some countries where this is done include Bhutan, Nepal, Germany, France, Italy, Brazil, Bulgaria, the US and Japan. In none of these countries is it possible for nearly 50 per cent of the source of funds to be unknown, but at present it is so in India," the ADR report pointed out.
BY Somina Ibitari
Reading a recent attack on the person of Dr Dakuku Adol Peterside, Director-General, Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, by Governor Nyesom Wike, through a proxy, one Simeon Nwakudu, I felt obliged to render a voluntary duty, to state the facts in a simple, unambiguous manner, and next, leave the reader to the impartial judgment of the conscience.
The style adopted herein presents both Peterside and Wike, their personalities, motives in the respective portfolios they hold, and then, testimonies about them in the public domain. I shall sum my argument to proving that Peterside is refined, responsible and an invaluable asset to Rivers State and Nigeria. On the other hand, the evidence I shall plead in my argument shall summarise Wike in their true person while that treatise, tried as the author, a political appointee of Wike and therefore beholding to him, might, to arm-twist truth, there is no alternative to the truth.
The truth is a healer of the conscience except that Wike has shown to be a man without that human regulator. First, who is Wike? What is their personality? There is no doubt that Wike's character defines their personality. Now to the specifics of Wike's barrage of lies. To state that Peterside visited the Progressives Congress, APC, National Chairman with bank statements and financial documents are nothing but a rehearsal of the Third Reich propagandist, Paul Joseph Goebbels, whose theory of “the big lie” sustained Adolf Hitler. This figment of the aide's mind gives an insight into how Wike's mind operates.
Everything, including serious state business, must be reduced to cash and bank statements. As to what Peterside told the APC National Chairman, it was never in doubt that they narrated the horror members of APC had been through in the hands of armed groups working for Wike Administration for which the author works for and labours, albeit fruitlessly, to prop its obnoxious human rights records. Wike has the worst personality image hiatus among governors in Nigeria. The Bible had Wike in mind when the Spirit asked, “Can the Ethiopian change their skin, or the leopard their spots…?”
Then to the second, and the most critical question that I have to answer. Who is Peterside? What is President Muhammadu Buhari's testimony about him? How impressed is the American Administration with Peterside? Peterside was the sole leading governorship candidate in Rivers State in 2015. Their state-wide acceptance and popularity drew crowds to their campaigns. Truly, they were the candidate to beat.
Why was their popularity the threat Wike and their sponsors needed to crack? The single project Wike and those who sponsored them had been to stop Peterside by any means possible. President Muhammadu Buhari, a man, not given to flippancy, had this commendation for Peterside: “Peterside's unanimous election (as Chairman, Association of African Maritime Administrators, AMAA) is not only a personal honour and an affirmation of confidence in their ability to lead AAMA but also places Nigeria in a pivotal position to rally other maritime administrations incollaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) towards safer global maritime activities.”
Unfortunately for Wike, nobody has such presidential commendation for him. President Buhari had acknowledged NIMASA's encouraging performance under Dr Peterside especially in the fight against sea piracy through inter agency cooperation. There is indeed a new NIMASA under Peterside, but it is a story of hard work.
NIMASA under Peterside has a new direction. Under Peterside, NIMASA today is the beautiful bride while Nigeria's waterways, including those in Rivers State, enjoy safety. In June 2017, Nigeria's most credible news magazine, TELL, bestowed on NIMASA the prestigious Public Organisation of the Year 2016 award following outstanding achievements recorded by the agency in 2016, despite the economic recession in the country. Wike would not like to hear this as proclaimed on the day of the award.
The Chairman of the Awards Committee, Mr Babs Alasa, described the award as an honour well deserved, stressing that Peterside has repositioned NIMASA for greater recognition within and outside Nigeria in a short period. “NIMASA has done very well under Peterside, and even President Muhammadu Buhari recognised this and congratulated them when they were unanimously elected as the Chairman of AAMA. At present, 1,045 beneficiaries graduated from NIMASA's human capital development programme, representing 42 per cent of over 2,500 participants sponsored by NIMASA. Credibility was the criteria for nomination.”
Peterside's testimonials also have international recognition. Wike won't like to hear theirs – the United States has recognised their exploits at NIMASA. Hear the verdict from America – “It appears the energy that NIMASA has at the ports is very tremendous, as seen in all the ports we visited in Lagos.” The United States Coast Guard (USCG) led by Commander Thomas Foster, on a visit to Nigeria, commended NIMASA for its strides in ensuring safety at the ports and expressed satisfaction with the infrastructure development regarding ISPS Code implementation in the ports. Through NIMASA, Nigeria now has about 80 per cent compliance rate for the International Ship and Port Facility Security, ISPS Code. Wike won't understand this term. Under Peterside's watch, NIMASA has targeted 100% compliance. In 2016, hear what Peterside said: “We have intensified NIMASA's drive to ensure strict compliance with the provision of the ISPS Code.
The result is that Nigeria now has a compliance rate of almost 80%, as 114 port facilities out of the total of 145 ports and jetties in Nigeria are now fully ISPS compliant.
Let's not forget that NIMASA was only appointed the Designated Authority for the implementation of ISPS Code in Nigeria barely five years ago when compliance level was barely 13%. Though 8% of the remaining 31 port facilities are currently pursuing compliance, our goal is to target a 100% compliance level writing the next twelve months.”While Wike is revoking Certificates of Occupancy of business chains in Rivers State, Peterside is pursuing Nigeria's common good, creating jobs for thousands of Nigerians, including Rivers natives.
Wike is ignorant of the role of NIMASA so they should read up the function of a maritime administration and they will surely join to celebrate this pride of our country.While Wike has borrowed over N150 billion under two years, Peterside has moved NIMASA to a giant revenue earner for the country. My summation in this matter is simple. It's on record that throughout the “abracadabra” PDP did in Rivers State through Madame Patience Jonathan, APC never lost any election in Opobo-Nkoro. Not even during the several rerun elections.

In the past two days, the makers of Milan Luthria's upcoming period crime drama Baadshaho have unveiled the looks of two of its six major characters, played by Ajay Devgn and Emraan Hashmi respectively. Now, they have unveiled yet another look - that of Vidyut Jammwal - from the film.
Jammwal's look from the film is the most interesting yet. Since the athletic actor has been only seen in a sleeveless action avatar in all their films so far, their full clad look commands attention. For once, the viewers are hooked on to their face and not their well toned biceps. They look royally smart, thanks to their mustache, hairstyle and concealed expression.
The caption of the image, shared by Jammwal on Twitter, says, 'The badass with a badge'. This hints at the possibility of Jammwal playing an army officer in the film. While the profession seems custom-made for the actor, their look comes across as a pleasant surprise.
The badass with a badge! Catch the exclusive look in today's edition of @htshowbizpic.twitter.com/EBp9XkPgHT — Vidyut Jammwal (@VidyutJammwal) June 15, 2017
Devgn called their character "'the badass in the bandana". They sported an all-black avatar, with guns in both hands and a patterned bandana covering half their face. Their signature intimidating and intense expression added character to the frame.
Hasmi described their character as the 'guns and roses badass' which suggests that it is a mix of the formidable and the generous. They sported a Rajasthani turban, along with a hint of tilak on their forehead. They were seen blowing the smoke away from the mouth of a pistol while holding a gun in their other hand. Hashmi's character looked menacing yet comes across as more layered than that of Devgn.
Baadshaho also stars Ileana D'Cruz, Esha Gupta and Sanjay Mishra, along with a special appearance by Sunny Leonne. It is co-produced by Luthria, and Bhushan and Krishan Kumar's T-Series Films. It is slated to release on 1 September.
He's been in the Marines for 16 years, they said. Because of deployments overseas, naturalizing took a long time. “I've been defending this country for some time, and it's great to finally be a citizen,” Dominguez Garcia said. “For me and my family, it's a dream come true.”

NEW YORK - Harav Aaron Brafman, zt”l, long-time Menahel, Yeshiva Derech Ayson–Yeshiva of Far Rockaway, was niftar on Erev Shabbos, 19 Av. They were 73 years old.
Rabbi Brafman was remembered for their tremendous dedication to their talmidim and to the broad needs of the klal. By personal example, as much as by their caring guidance, they infused generations of talmidim with the confidence that they could grow to live lives of true bnei Torah.
Rabbi Brafman was born in 1944 to Reb Shlomo Zalman, z”l, and Mrs. Rochel Brafman, a”h. The family initially lived in Williamsburg and later moved to Crown Heights.
Young Aaron was enrolled in Yeshivah Torah Vodaath at a young age and would remain there for more than 20 years, studying in its kollel and serving as a Maggid Shiur. There, they became an exceptionally close talmid of Harav Yaakov Kamenetsky, Harav Gedaliah Schorr and Harav Avrohom Pam, zecher tzaddikim l'vrachah.
Rabbi Brafman constantly sought their Rebbeim's teachings and guidance, carefully learning from their ways and incorporating their worldviews. As someone who placed great emphasis on understanding world affairs according to hashkafas haTorah, Rabbi Brafman invested much time and energy to gain a full understanding of their Rebbeim's daas Torah on a wide range of topics. Even many years after their petirah, Rabbi Brafman's first move to evaluating life choices was to consider how their great mentors would have approached the matters.
From a young age, they distinguished themselves for their hasmadah. Someone who often traveled together with them on the subway ride from Crown Heights to yeshivah testified that Reb Aaron routinely spent the entire trip immersed in a Gemara that they carried with him.
In 1964, they married Susie Schwartz, the daughter of Joseph, z”l, and Elsa Schwartz, a”h, natives of Frankfurt, Germany, who had settled in San Francisco. For the many years of their marriage, Rebbetzin Brafman stood dutifully at their husband's side, caring for the needs of their home and growing family in a manner that allowed their husband to focus their energies on their own growth in Torah, their talmidim and their many efforts on behalf of the klal.
Recognizing their talents as a mechanech, while still in their mid 20s, Rabbi Brafman was selected to serve as a Maggid Shiur in Torah Vodaath's mesivta.
In 1970, Rabbi Brafman accepted an invitation to serve as the Menahel of the Yeshiva of Far Rockaway, which had only recently been founded by its Rosh Yeshivah, Harav Yechiel Perr, shlita, a talmid of Harav Aharon Kotler, zt”l. With their sincere sense of caring, they forged deep relationships with generations of talmidim, carefully tending to each of their needs, putting their growth before any other considerations.
Carrying a sense of responsibility for the klal at large, Rabbi Brafman delivered regular shiurim and mussar vaadim to groups of local baalei batim. They also raised funds for a tzedakah fund they maintained for needy members of the Far Rockaway community.
Rabbi Brafman's anavah and unassuming manner made them a uniquely approachable figure. Yet, their concern for the state of Klal Yisrael did not hold them back from speaking out on topics that they felt were of great importance to the community.
Rabbi Brafman had been in declining health in recent years.
The levayah was held Friday afternoon in the Yeshiva of Far Rockaway. After Shabbos, the mittah was flown to Eretz Yisrael, where additional hespeidim were delivered, followed by kevurah in the Eretz HaChaim cemetery in Beit Shemesh.
Rabbi Brafman is survived by, ybl”c, their wife, Rebbetzin Susie Brafman; brother, Mr. Benjamin Brafman; sisters, Mrs. Malky Aaron and Mrs. Shevy Kooperberg; son, Rabbi Avrohom Boruch Brafman; daughters, Mrs. Naomi Ullman, Mrs. Esther Braun, Mrs. Sima Rottenberg, Mrs. Rina Bloch, Mrs. Aviva Guzik, Mrs. Shoshana Friedman and Mrs. Batsheva Feldman; as well as by many grandchildren.

Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday enacted their third small hike in a key interest rate in six months, a move that will push it above 1% for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
The 0.25 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate, which was widely expected by financial markets, was another validation of the recovery from the Great Recession. It also signaled Fed officials are convinced the economic slowdown over the winter was temporary.
“Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded,” Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen told reporters. They and their colleagues “continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate” to sustain a healthy labor market and price stability.
Supporting that view, members of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee indicated that they expected one more 0.25 percentage point increase this year and three next year — the same as they had forecast in March.
And in another signal of their confidence in the economy, Fed officials announced that they intended this year to begin reducing the $4.5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities and other assets the central bank has purchased since 2008 in an attempt to stimulate the economy.
Fed officials voted 8-1 on Wednesday to raise the target level for the rate, a key benchmark for consumer and business lending, to between 1% and 1.25%. The rate, which can fluctuate a bit daily, usually settles somewhere in the middle.
Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, preferred to keep the rate at its current level and voted against the hike. In a policy statement, committee members said that economic activity "has been rising moderately."
Although monthly job gains have moderated, they still have been solid, while household spending and business investment have been expanding, the statement said.
Fed officials slightly boosted their expectations for economic growth this year, to 2.2% from a 2.1% projection in March. The forecast for 2018 remained the same at 2.1%.
They also were more optimistic about unemployment. Fed policymakers now expect the rate to be at 4.3% by the end of the year, down from a March forecast of 4.5%.
The Labor Department reported the rate fell to 4.3% in May, the lowest since 2001. Fed officials expect the rate to decline to 4.2% next year.
But they downgraded their expectation for inflation to 1.6% this year. That was down from 1.9% in March. The Fed's annual target is 2%, which policymakers still anticipate will be reached next year.
Investors have been eagerly expecting details for how the Fed would reduce the assets on its balance sheet.
The amount of assets soared from about $925 billion before the financial crisis hit as the Fed started to buy securities to try to stimulate the economy.
The plan announced Wednesday calls for the Fed to reduce its holdings by gradually allowing an increasing amount of maturing securities to be run off each month.
Over time, the amount of assets would be reduced "to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years" but larger than before the crisis, Fed officials said.
Yellen said the plan would lead to “a largely and predictable decline” in the assets. The reductions would begin this year “provided that the economy evolves broadly” as Fed officials are forecasting, they said.
Policymakers said they would be prepared to stop the reductions if there were "a material deterioration in the economic outlook" that led to "a sizable reduction" in the federal funds rate.
Yellen would not comment on their future beyond their intention to serve out their term as chairperson, which ends next February. President Trump has sent mixed messages over the past year about Yellen's performance leading the Fed.
“I have not had conversations with the president about future plans,” they said.
The White House is “working hard” to identify nominees for three vacancies on the seven-member Fed Board of Governors, Yellen said.
“I do very much hope that there will be nominations in the not too distant future. ... I look forward to having a full board,” they told reporters.
Fed officials had indicated at their meeting last month they were ready for another small interest rate hike. Investors put the odds of a 0.25 percentage point increase by the Fed this month at about 94%, according to the CME Group futures exchange.
The economy grew at an anemic 1.2% annual rate from January through March. Economists expect a rebound in the second quarter to at least 2%.
But there have been some warning signs in the economic data. Labor market growth has slowed somewhat since last year, including a lackluster 138,000 net new jobs added in May. And retail sales in May posted their biggest drop in 16 months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
Inflation also has slowed. The consumer price index declined in May for the second time in three months, the Labor Department said Wednesday.

LUSAKA - Zambia's parliament suspended 48 opposition lawmakers on Tuesday for boycotting a speech by the president, widening a political rift that has alarmed rights groups.
Parliament's speaker barred the United Party for National Development (UPND) politicians from taking their seats for 30 days, a move that banned them from the building and stopped their pay.
Their party, which was defeated in August elections that it said were rigged, called the suspensions unconstitutional.
The lawmakers boycotted President Edgar Lungu's address at the official opening of the assembly in March, saying they did not recognize them as leader.
A month later, the UPND's leader, Hakainde Hichilema, and five others were arrested and charged with treason after a column of opposition vehicles failed to make way for Lungu's motorcade.
Amnesty International has said the treason charges are "trumped up" and called for the politicians' release.
On Tuesday, parliament's speaker Patrick Matibini told the opposition lawmakers: "I challenge you to resign on moral grounds if you do not recognize that there is a legitimately elected government."
The suspensions affected 48 of the party's 58 MPs. The remaining 10 had officially excused themselves from attending parliament on the day of Lungu's speech and were not included in the suspension.
Hichilema was moved from a prison in Lusaka to a maximum security facility outside the capital on June 9.
After the improbable success of Billy Madison, which saw Adam Sandler and their old college roommate turned writing partner beating the Hollywood odds by sticking to their guns, the breakout Saturday Night Live star and their pals were given a second shot: Happy Gilmore. Generations of fans have quoted the golf comedy ever since. Here we'll take a look at 10 things you never knew about Happy Gilmore.
The real Happy Gilmore.
There was no pro golf career, Subway endorsement, fistfight with Bob Barker, or romance with a future star of Modern Family, but the character of Happy Gilmore was inspired by one of Adam Sandler's real life friends. Kyle McDonough, an aspiring hockey star who sent the ball flying on the golf course, eventually joined the British Hockey League and spent some time on the ice in Norway. In the Adam Sandler installment of the Celebrities with Heart book series for young readers, McDonough's wife says their husband doesn't have anger issues, but can "hit a golf ball a mile."
Shooter McRobin Hood.
Producers originally approached Kevin Costner for the crucial role of Happy Gilmore villain Shooter McGavin. They made an altogether different golf comedy, Tin Cup, around the same time. According to VH1, Evil Dead franchise star Bruce Campbell lobbied hard for the part, which went to Christopher McDonald.
The real Shooter.
Of course the role of Shooter McGavin is now forever intertwined with McDonald, who'd played Daryl in 1991's Thelma & Louise. McDonald turned down Happy Gilmore - twice - till a meeting with Sandler changed their mind. Like the rest of us, he's been in love with the awesomely awful Shooter McGavin ever since, even starring in a fantastic short mockumentary style video in 2013 poking fun at how much he's now associated with it. In one scene, a caterer hands them a "special" breakfast...
Bob Barker can really fight.
Anyone who grew up watching The Price is Right when Bob Baker held the skinny microphone is well aware of their kindness and compassion, given the advocacy he's done for animals over the years. But just because he's a vegetarian, that doesn't mean they can't handle their beefs. The former Navy fighter pilot earned a black belt in karate back in the day, under none other than Chuck Norris, who they credited with putting them on the path for longevity. They were hesitant about taking the Happy Gilmore part until they learned he'd definitively win the fistfight. They also did their own stunts. It won the duo the first ever MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. In 2015, the pair revisited their "beef" for charity on Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars.
Grandma's Boy.
He's hard to recognize under all of that hair, but Otto the homeless caddy was none other than Allen Covert, Sandler's longtime friend and Happy Madison Productions collaborator who played the title role in the cult comedy Grandma's Boy ten years later. Covert's IMDb page is full of Sandler projects, starting with 1989's Going Overboard, followed by Airheads, Happy Gilmore, Bulletproof, The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy, Never Been Kissed, Big Daddy, Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and on, and on...
Bond villain Balance.
Movie fans the world over fondly remember the late Richard Kiel as the James Bond villain turned ally Jaws. The actor, who was more than 7 feet tall, worked mostly in television, including the classic Twilight Zone episode "To Serve Man," before their breakout performance opposite Roger Moore in 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me. Audiences were so fond of Jaws, they switched from villain to hero in Moonraker two years later. In 1992, they suffered a severe head injury in an auto accident, which threw off their balance. That's why Mr. Larson is often seen leaning on someone or something for support. Happy Gilmore gave them significantly more lines than ever.
Whip it good.
The Happy Gilmore score was composed by the frontman for new wave art rockers Devo, who had huge hits in the early days of MTV with "Whip It" and their cover of The Rolling Stones "Satisfaction." Like Oingo Boingo's Danny Elfman, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh has found tremendous success as a composer, working on kid TV shows like Rugrats, the famous "Get a Mac" commercials, several Wes Anderson films, and more recently, 21 Jump Street, The Lego Movie, and one of our favorite scores, Thor: Ragnarok. Almost 20 years after Happy Gilmore, Mothersbaugh composed the music for Adam Sandler's Hotel Transylvania, at the urging of their then young kids.
Happy Gilmore and the pros.
In 2013, a European Tour camera crew convinced several Scottish Open participants to give the Happy Gilmore style drive a shot. Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers got into a hilarious fake Twitter fight with the fictitious Shooter McGavin after the NFL star tweeted that he'd be laying off golf to better stay in shape. In 2017, tweeting about their participation in the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic, Steph Curry said their only expectations were to "keep the ball out of the gallery and not go Happy Gilmore." ESPN has marked the fake anniversary of Happy's PGA win. Sadly, golf pro Lee Trevino, who made one of the more memorable cameos, told a crowd at the University of Texas they wished he'd passed on Happy Gilmore. "If I'd known they were going to use all those foul words in there, I never would have done it."

Happy's hole.
Want to pay a visit to the site of the famous Bob Barker brawl? British Columbia's Furry Creek Golf and Country Club, whose 9th hole was the backdrop for the "Price is Wrong" showdown, has fully embraced their association with the Sandler comedy classic. They even went so far as to rename the 325-yard par 4 "Happy's Hole."
The Putter.
As of the time we're putting this list together, the hockey stick golf putter hybrid from Happy Gilmore can be yours. This guy is selling it for a mere $1200.00.
On 11 December, China successfully launched Algeria's first communication satellite, the first project in aerospace industry between the North African nation and Beijing.
The Alcomsat-1 was launched into a present orbit from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in the southwestern province of Sichuan, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
It will be used by Algeria for broadcast and television, emergency communication, distance education, e-governance, enterprise communication, broadband access and satellite-based navigation, it said.
The satellite was launched 40 minutes past midnight by the Chinese Long March-3B carrier rocket, making it the 258th flight mission for the Long March rocket family.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and their Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika exchanged congratulatory messages on the successful launch of Alcomsat-1, the report said.

Turkey's security council advises extending emergency
2017-04-18 00:25 | www.trend.az | 0
Turkey's National Security Council has recommended extending the country's ongoing state of emergency, according to a statement following Monday evening's meeting, Anadolu reported.
The National Security Council, which convened in Ankara under the chairpersonship of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued the statement after a 50-minute meeting.
The statement said that the council advised extension of the state of emergency "in an attempt to provide the continuance of measures aimed at securing the rights and freedoms of citizens."
After last summer's deadly coup attempt blamed on the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO), which martyred 249 people and injured some 2,200 others, Turkey declared a state of emergency on July 20.
According to the Turkish Constitution, a state of emergency can be declared for a maximum period of six months.
To enact the state of emergency, the government must see serious indications of widespread violence that could interfere with Turkey's democratic environment or its citizens' basic rights and freedoms as e established by the Constitution.
Bavaria's conservative government ordered on Wednesday Christian crosses to be placed at the entrance of all state administrative buildings.
The regional government says the crosses shouldn't be seen as religious symbols, but are meant to reflect the southern German state's "cultural identity and Christian-western influence."
German news agency dpa reported that Tuesday's decree won't affect municipal and federal government buildings in Bavaria.
Crosses are already compulsory in public schools and courtrooms in predominantly Catholic Bavaria.
The governing Christian Social Union — the Bavaria-only wing of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party — is hoping to avoid losing its state majority to Alternative for Germany, a party on the right whose anti-Muslim campaigns have struck a chord with some German voters.
In an early-phase clinical trial of a new oral drug, selumetinib, children with the common genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas, tumors of the peripheral nerves, tolerated selumetinib and, in most cases, responded to it with tumor shrinkage. NF1 affects 1 in 3,000 people. The study results appeared Dec. 29, 2016, in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The multicenter phase I clinical trial, which included 24 patients, was led by Brigitte C. Widemann, M.D., acting chief of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Pediatric Oncology Branch, and was sponsored by NCI's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. The study, conducted at the NIH Clinical Center and three participating sites, took advantage of techniques developed by Dr. Widemann's team that enabled very precise measurement of the plexiform neurofibromas. Experiments in mice that developed neurofibromas due to genetic modifications were performed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the laboratory of Nancy Ratner, Ph.D. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.
Plexiform neurofibromas develop in up to 50 percent of people with NF1. The majority of these tumors, which can cause significant pain, disability, and disfigurement, are diagnosed in early childhood and grow most rapidly prior to adolescence. Complete surgical removal of the tumors is rarely feasible, and incompletely resected tumors tend to grow back.
The primary aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the toxicity and safety of selumetinib in patients with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and, encouragingly, most of the selumetinib-related toxic effects were mild. At present, no therapies are considered effective for NF1-related large plexiform neurofibromas, but, in this trial, partial responses, meaning 20 percent or more reduction in tumor volume, were observed in over 70 percent of the patients.
Responses were observed in tumors that were previously growing at a rate of greater than 20 percent per year, as well as in non-progressing lesions. Tumor shrinkage was maintained long term, for approximately two years, and, as of early 2016, no disease progression had been observed in any trial participant. Additionally, anecdotal evidence of clinical improvement, such as a decrease in tumor-related pain, improvement in motor function, and decreased disfigurement, was reported.
“Some may say that a 20 percent volume reduction is too small to be meaningful, but to me, just stopping the growth of these devastating tumors is an important achievement,” said Dr. Widemann. “The difference we see in these patients is truly unprecedented.”
The disease-causing gene for NF1 was first identified in 1990 by two independent teams, one of them led by NIH Director Francis S. Collins, Ph.D., M.D., who at the time was chief of Medical Genetics at the University of Michigan. The other team was led by Ray White at the University of Utah. Research to understand the gene's function revealed that deregulation of the RAS signaling pathway was the most likely cause of tumor development. Numerous drugs that target RAS-related signaling pathways have been tested in patients with NF1 in phase I and phase II clinical trials, with disappointing results, hence the interest in selumetinib.
Selumetinib, provided for the study by AstraZeneca, is a selective inhibitor of the MEK protein, a part of the complex network of RAS signaling pathways. The drug has demonstrated activity in some advanced cancers, but it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. It is manufactured in capsule form to be taken orally.
Trial enrollment began in September 2011 and 24 children (11 girls, 13 boys) participated. Twice daily doses of the medicine were taken continuously, over a median of 30 month-long treatment cycles. The majority of patients are still continuing with therapy, some for as long as five years, and the long-term treatment has had no observed adverse effect on their development or overall health.
Experiments in mice with similar neurofibromas confirmed the inhibition of the MEK protein function in the tumors. Inhibition of the MEK protein diminished as early as two hours after drug administration. In addition, the animals received treatment with regular interruptions and still demonstrated tumor responses. This indicates that even limited MEK inhibition could cause tumor shrinkage in this disease.
“In the future, we may wish to look at intermittent dosing in patients to minimize toxicity and retain maximal outcomes,” said Dr. Widemann.
In some patients, a loss of response to selumetinib with slow regrowth of tumors was observed, particularly after dose reductions. The researchers believe that additional studies are warranted to characterize tumors that no longer respond to selumetinib. NCI is currently sponsoring an ongoing phase II trial of the drug for adults with NF1, in which serial tissue samples are being obtained. This study should provide information about possible mechanisms of resistance to selumetinib.
In addition, a larger phase II pediatric trial is enrolling patients and should help establish the efficacy of selumetinib treatment in children. In this trial, in addition to tumor volume measurements, evaluations are being performed to assess the effect of selumetinib on plexiform neurofibroma related disfigurement, pain, quality of life, and function.
This research was supported by NCI's Center for Cancer Research and the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program; by the Children's Tumor Foundation to Michael Fisher to support participating sites other than the NCI; by AstraZeneca providing selumetinib and funding for the pharmacokinetic analysis; and by grants from the Children's Tumor Foundation and the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (to Dr. Ratner for the mouse preclinical trials).
The moment suspected gunman James T. Hodgkinson opened fire at a group of Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game on Wednesday morning was captured on video by a man walking their dog.
People can be seen running as dozens of gunshots are heard in the video, filmed through the fence of the baseball diamond.

“Is that guy OK out there?” the man recording the video is heard saying, as an apparent victim is seen lying on the ground.
The shooting left Republican member of congress Steve Scalise in critical condition, and wounded several others.
There are repeated gunshot noises in the nearly six-minute-long video, and they continue after police sirens are heard. Hodgkinson was shot by Capitol Hill police who were at the scene, and police said they later died.
A witness on social media described hearing nearly 80 gunshots during the shooting.

“We had three members of Congress took shelter in our apartment and they said (the shooting) was down on the field,” Benjamin Childers explained during a live stream shortly after the shooting, adding the three were not injured.
While police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was too early to determine whether it was a deliberate political attack, the shooting intensified concerns among some politicians and the public about the sharp divide and bitter rhetoric in U.S. politics.
Hodgkinson was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including “The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans,” “Terminate The Republican Party,” and “Donald Trump is not my President,” their profile showed before it was taken down.

Rollie Davis Sr. was killed in an officer-involved shooting after confronting a Quincy Police officer while armed.
On May 15th, 2018, the officer was confronted during a suspicious person check. The officer discharged their weapon, fatally shooting Rollie Davis Sr., 53, of Quincy, Illinois.
An autopsy was conducted on May 16, 2018, in Bloomington, and the results of which are pending analysis. Illinois State Police (ISP) Zone 4 Investigations conducted the Officer Involved Shooting investigation. This incident remains an open and ongoing investigation.
A 13-year-old boy is recovering from their injuries after falling 30-feet from a popular hiking trail.
This happened Sunday afternoon at Manoa Falls Trail.
The Honolulu Fire Department said the boy was with family when they fell to the base of the waterfall.
They were airlifted out and taken to the hospital in serious condition.
Manoa Falls is considered a family friendly hike, but can still be dangerous.
The Hawaiian Trail and Mountain Club is a group of hiking enthusiasts — and the club has been around for over 100 years.
They help all different types of families those who live here and others who just moved to Hawaii.
But the club wants more to be done for tourists to bring awareness about the dangers of hiking.
Fire officials tell us the boy who fell at Manoa Falls Sunday recently moved to Hawaii because their family is in the military.
Hiking expert and Hawaiian Trail and Mountain Club member Barbara Bruno said normally they do outreach for military families.
“Sometimes we send them education, recently we had a club member called Jim Yuen long time club member went to make an in-person presentation, sometimes they have outreach events that they invite us to,” Bruno explained.
What the club wants to do more of is to educate tourists.
“I'm 61 and thought it would be a good choice for me, but it's near the top. Real rocky and steep, no handrails. Thank God they were there to help me down. It was worse coming down,” said Jan McGowan, who is visiting from Texas.
Department of Land and Natural Resources officials did not give us an on-camera interview, but the state's website (HawaiiTrails.org) said Manoa Falls Trail is considered suitable for most novice hikers. However, it also notes that, “conditions can change when it rains. Trail can become very muddy and slippery in many areas”
“Often times when a trail is relatively easy we can get overconfident,” said Bruno. “We would love it if the hotel industry got involved in sharing information about hiking tips with tourists.”
Bruno said safe practices include bringing water, food, and a first aid kit. Tell someone about your hiking plans and don't hike alone. Most importantly know your limits.
“It's very easy if you have experience hiking on the mainland to think I'm an intermediate or advanced hiker. But I would say anyone new to Hawaii should start with the beginning novice trails and build up their experience and confidence level,” said Bruno. “Hikes in Hawaii, even some of the easy ones, have very steep drop offs so it's very easy to get hurt.”
Fire officials said the most rescues they do are at popular trails like Manoa Falls and Diamond Head.
Scientists should be allowed to alter a person's DNA in ways that will be passed on to future generations, but only to prevent serious and strongly heritable diseases, according to a new report from the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine.
However, tinkering with these genes in order to enhance or alter traits such as strength, intelligence or beauty should remain off-limits, the report authors concluded.
Changing the so-called germline — effectively, editing humanity's future by altering genes in human reproductive cells — is illegal in the United States. It has largely been considered ethically off-limits here as well, at least while bioethicists and scientists pondered the unforeseen effects and unexamined moral dilemmas of using new gene-editing technologies.
However, scientists have moved forward aggressively to explore the feasibility of altering disease genes in other adult human cells with a revolutionary technique known as CRISPR-Cas9. It is widely believed that gene editing of this sort could treat patients with metabolic disorders, certain cancers, and a range of other diseases that arise from genetic mutations — without altering the germline.
Last year, Chinese scientists launched a trial that uses CRISPR-Cas9 in a treatment for lung cancer. While the trial's outcome is awaited with high anticipation, scientists outside of China have expressed concern that ethical reservations in the United States and Europe will put them at a disadvantage.
CRISPR-Cas9 makes gene editing more straightforward, more precise and far more widespread. As such, the National Academies' report acknowledges that changing heritable DNA in eggs, sperm and early embryos is fast becoming “a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.”
The 22-member panel of scientists and bioethicists who produced the report completed a comprehensive review of the issues raised by that prospect.
Clinical trials involving germline editing should only be pursued to treat diseases that cannot be improved with “reasonable alternatives,” the committee said. In addition, they added, scientists should convincingly demonstrate they are targeting a gene that either causes or strongly predisposes a carrier to a serious disease or condition, and that they have weighed the likely risks and benefits of altering that gene.
These clinical trials should be conducted under public scrutiny that takes into account issues of societal fairness, personal dignity and scientific integrity, the panel said.
Finally, scientists should conduct long-term follow-up studies to discern how gene editing affects subsequent generations. Public debate and discussion about the technology should continue, the panel added.
“Genome editing research is very much an international endeavor, and all nations should ensure that any potential clinical applications reflect societal values and be subject to appropriate oversight and regulation,” said MIT cancer researcher Richard O. Hynes, who co-chaired the panel with University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist R. Alta Charo. “These overarching principles and the responsibilities that flow from them should be reflected in each nation's scientific community and regulatory processes.”
Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, an immunologist and bioethicist who was not on the panel, said the group “has asked the compelling questions,” sparking a conversation that must keep up with a rapid pace of scientific discovery in this field. They called the report's release “a fantastic development.”
“What they're saying is, let's start the conversation, maintain ethical structures along the way, and hopefully do this the right way,” said Whelan, who serves on the advisory board of USC's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies.
The international panel included members from the U.S., China, France, Israel and Italy. Their report was underwritten in part by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Agartala: India wanted peaceful relations with Pakistan, but its forces have been told that if one bullet come from across the border, they should fire countless bullets to retaliate, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Agartala on Saturday night.
"I have given standing orders to our forces to shoot limitless bullets to retaliate a single fire on our territory by the Pakistani forces," they said at an election rally at Barjala on the state capital's outskirts.
"As our neighbour, we do not want to attack on Pakistan first. We want to live with peace and harmony with our all neighbours. But, most unfortunately Pakistan is trying to tear down Jammu and Kashmir and continue attacks on our forces and Indian territory," they added.
Hitting out at the Left Front government, Rajnath Singh said that during its 25 year uninterrupted rule, it did nothing for the development of Tripura, economic prosperity of the state and to remove huge poverty and unemployment.
"During CPM's 35 years rule in West Bengal, they ruined that state, and if the Left parties after the February 18 assembly polls are allowed to rule Tripura further, they would destroy the future of the state and its people," they alleged.
They said that only their Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) can develop the country and the northeastern states including Tripura.
"BJP and its allies are now ruling 19 states in India. Why so many states are under BJP and its allies' governance ? Because people of these states trust BJP and people sincerely believe that only BJP can remove their poverty and provide jobs to the youth."
Rajnath Singh said that Tripura has huge natural resources and if BJP comes to power in the state, it would make this northeastern state a number one state in India.
"You have given scope to the Left parties in Tripura many times, give scope to BJP once this time to rule for genuine development of the state with all-round growth of all sections of people," they said.

Amid the ongoing protests in Darjeeling, West Bengal police raided Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung's office on Thursday morning. Reports said that the police recovered weapons, including a crossbow.

"A raid is going on in Bimal Gurung's office since morning. Several arms have been already recovered", Akhilesh Kumar Chaturvedi, the Superintendent of Police of Darjeeling district told IANS. However, they refused to disclose any details about the types and quantity of arms seized by police.
According to police sources, huge cache of arms and ammunition including bow and arrows, knives, axes and cartridges were seized.
Responding to the sudden raid, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rahul Sinha claimed that such drastic steps may worsen the situation in the hills and has urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to call an all-party meeting in the Bengal hills to solve the situation.
"Mamata Banerjee provoked the unrest in the hills and now they are making the situation even worse with these steps. They should immediately call an all-party meeting in Darjeeling to listen to their demands and sort out the situation", Sinha claimed.
However, they clarified that BJP is in no way supporting the GJM's demand of a separate state of Gorkhaland. "We have never supported the Gorkhaland demand, nor do we support it now," they added.
Raid at Gurung's office comes a day after the GJM leader threatened to intensify the movement for a separate Gorkhaland. The political crisis in the Darjeeling hills took a new turn after the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) snapped its alliance with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday after having joined hands with agitation spearhead GJM, saying the party has been fighting for Gorkhaland since its inception.
Emboldened by the GNLF aligning with their party, Gurung on Tuesday had threatened to intensify the movement for a separate Gorkhaland even as the indefinite shutdown in the government and the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) offices entered its third day.
The GNLF, formed by the late firebrand leader Subhash Ghisingh, had led a violent movement for Gorkhaland in the eighties, following which the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) was formed.
Gurung broke away from the GNLF and formed the GJM in 2007 and subsequently emerged as the dominant force in the hills."The GNLF, since its inception in the eighties under the leadership Subhash Ghisingh, has been fighting for Gorkhaland. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a separate state of Gorkhaland," Neraaj Zimba, spokesperson of the GNLF, told PTI.
They said the alliance with the TMC was never a political or ideological one, but an electoral tie-up. The TMC is trying to deflect attention from the real demand of Gorkhaland through "doles and charity", Zimba said. Six columns of army personnel have been already been deployed in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong towns with addition 600 troops being provided by Central Government on Tuesday.
Referring to the all-party meeting held on Tuesday, Gurung claimed that all political outfits in the hills had decided to work together. Accusing the Mamata government of running "political dictatorship" in the hills, Gurung appealed to the tourists and people working there to reconsider the situation and take a call on staying there.
"I would request the tourists and the people who have come to work here to change their mind about coming and staying here. The state government is doing dictatorship politics here. How can the tourists stay here in this situation," Gurung said.
"Incidents like baton charge are happening here everyday. In this situation, how it can there be work or tourism in this situation," they wondered.
Gurung told PTI that they will shortly resign from the post of the GTA chief executive but the GJM MLAs and the municipal councillors will not step down.
The shutdown has led to spurts of violence in the state with several state government offices torched, vandalised or forcibly shut. On Monday, protesters tried to torch the PWD office in Darjeeling and the Block Development Office (BDO) in Bijanbari and Pulbazar. A hydro project in Sonada was also ransacked by the protesters.
As the movement gathered steam, GJM attempted to revive the decades-old Gorkhaland movement, a demand of separation of Nepalese-speaking districts of West Bengal into a separate state.

FALLING oil prices have made alternatives to fossil fuels less viable in the short term, a report into energy generation in 25 major islands has said.
The Island Global Research report rated the islands in terms of their energy security from one – most resilient, to five – most vulnerable.
Guernsey scored a two, behind both Jersey and the Isle of Man which scored one.
Key aspects affecting the level of vulnerability include the proportion of energy generated from alternative fuel sources versus oil and gas imports, the current impact of policies promoting alternative fuels or other methods of energy security and levels of public and private investment in sustainable energy solutions, the report said.

From their Instagram update, it looks like Priyanka Chopra gave 2017 a fresh start in one the best ways possible—hiding away at an undisclosed location, lounging on a deck chair, their skin glowing in the sun, no make-up needed.
Athiya Shetty, Jacqueline Fernandez, Vaani Kapoor and Neha Dhupia seem to have got the same memo—all gave their make-up kits a break and kept it light and easy with neutral tones (or nothing at all).
On the other hand, Sonakshi Sinha turned siren mode on with their smoky-eye, bright-lip, red-dress look, Kendall Jenner partied it up in playful curls and tangerine lips, Bipasha Basu paired their new Fendi sunglasses (a gift from husband Karan Singh Grover) with a fuchsia pout, and Karisma Kapoor stepped out in their trademark red and a spangly festive dress. Jennifer Lopez made the best of both themes and showed us how to work a off-duty celeb look to perfection—with a messy top knot, nude-brown lips, contoured cheeks and oversized sunglasses.

Mobile World Congress 2017 is sure to be big. But as per the latest rumors, Nokia would make it even bigger by officially launching its four major upcoming handsets at this event. HMD Global, which now owns the exclusive right to market devices with the brand name of Nokia, is said to reveal four smartphones in MWC 2017. Though it hasn't been confirmed by any potential sources till now, but the launch event is expected to hold on February 26.
According to BGR, the company would bring Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 to this event. It should be noted in this context that Nokia 6 has already been launched in China. Although, the worldwide release of the same is still awaited which is expected by many to happen at this event only. Besides all this, HMD Global owned Nokia is also speculated to throwback one of its elegant handsets which earlier witnessed a superlative hike of appreciation among its users: Nokia 3310. Famous tech analyst and smartphone expert Evan Blass also marked their words on this news.
As per a report by VentureBeat, they also surfaced their insight about these handsets' expected specifications and features in advance. They stated that Nokia 6 will boast a full HD panel with 5.5-inch display, Snapdragon 430 system-On-processor, 4GB of RAM, and 16-megapixel primary camera and most probably Android Nougat OS update out of the box. Whereas, Nokia 5 would flaunt some incredible features like 5.2 inches display panel with 720p the highest resolution rate, 2GB RAM, and a 12-megapixel main rear snapper. While Nokia 6 will be marketed with a price tag of €249, Nokia 5 will be sold at €199.

While not much has been revealed about its features and attributes, Nokia 3 is said to be an entry-level Android smartphone. It is still not clear whether the handset will see Android Nougat update or not. The smartphone has been indicated to be retailed at €149 only.
Popular boxer Cello Renda is the Peterborough Telegraph Sports Personality of the Year for 2017.
The Newborough-based scrapper pipped veteran triathlete Georgina Jennings and Peterborough Panthers speedway team manager Carl Johnson to the main prize.
City of Peterborough Hockey Club Ladies first XI skipper Robyn Gribble (right) and vice-captain Emma Faux (left) collected the team of the year prize from sponsor Stephen 'Tommy' Cooper of Sports Ground Development.
Renda is a triple title winner, all at different weights, and their scraps are usually all-action, entertaining affairs.
Renda is also a tireless charity worker.
“This award means a lot to me,” Renda enthused after receiving the award from Darren Fogg of sponsor Chroma Sport. “It's a reward for 14 years of hard work. I'm thrilled to bits.”
Martial arts provided the winners of the sportsman and sportswoman of the year competitions in the shape of World Masters champion Rob Taylor and European champion Sarah Chapman.
It was a great night for the ladies as the record-breaking City of Peterborough Hockey Club won the team of the year prize and Cassie Steward of Peterborough Northern Star picked up the footballer of the year trophy. It's the second year in a row a lady player has won an award dominated by Posh players in the early years.
Junior footballer of the year went to young Posh Academy goalkeeper Charlie Bedford who pipped clubmate Luca Christoudias and Lewis Arber, son of former Posh defender Mark Arber, of Yaxley under 12s. Yaxley Under 12s were runners-up in the team of the year category.
The junior (under 16) sportsman of the year prize was won by emerging field athlete Donovon Capes, the grandson of former Olympic shot putter Geoff Capes. Brilliant City of Peterborough Swimming Club performer Amelia Monaghan won the junior sportswoman prize after a year in which they won gold, silver and bronze medals at the British and National Championships.
Amelia's coach Ben Negus won coach of the year for the second time, while paralympic gold medal winning rower James Fox won a new category, the disabled achiever prize. Fox, who has picked up world, paralympic and european medals, and has never lost a race in a GB paralympic vest, pipped super swimmer Jack Anderson and gifted athlete Brandon Ballard. Fox has also received an MBE and the freedom of Peterborough in recent times.
Ian Pepper was a popular winner of the unsung hero category. Pepper is the secretary of Werrington Athletic FC and looks after 13 junior and youth teams. He's been in the demanding role for over 20 years. They also coach an under six teams at the club.
The Peterborough Telegraph would like to thank fellow sponsors Chroma Sport, Sports Ground Development, Sycamore BMW, Moore Steel Developments, Krusada, Sandhills East, Coca-Cola, BGL & the Peterborough Football & Sports Development Foundation.

TBILISI: Georgia's Orthodox Church was rocked Monday after police announced the arrest of a priest over a suspected poisoning plot targeting a high-ranking Church figure.
Prosecutors in the Caucasus nation said they caught archpriest Giorgi Mamaladze with sodium cyanide on February 10 as they boarded a plane to Berlin, where Patriarch Ilia II was awaiting a gallbladder operation.
The country's chief prosecutor said in a statement that Mamaladze was in pre-trial detention on "suspicion of plotting to murder a high-ranking Church official".
The statement did not specify the target of the plot but the prime minister responded by ordering increased security for 83-year-old Ilia.
Mamaladze, who is director general of the Georgian Church's medical clinic, "had systematic contacts" with the patriarch, prosecutors said.
Ilia -- who has long suffered ill health -- successfully underwent the gallbladder operation in Germany on Monday, Georgian media reported.
The conservative Georgian Orthodox Church -- followed by more than 80 percent of the 4.5 million population -- is one of several distinct Eastern Orthodox Churches, which also include the Greek and Russian Churches.
Ilia II -- who has led the Church such since 1977 -- wields significant influence on Georgia's social and political life.
They oversaw a major revival of the Church after Georgia regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
The Church was severely repressed during the Soviet era and Tsarist Russia's occupation of Georgia.

KARACHI - The jail authorities on Monday submitted their affidavit in a petition challenging a notification of declaring ex-SSP Malir Rao Anwar's house a sub-jail. The authorities stated that Rao was confined at sub jail duo to security threats. The court adjourned hearing, until July 11. A division bench headed by Justice Khadam Hussain Tunio was hearing a petition filed by Muhammad Khan, father of Naqeebullah Mahsud, who was killed in a fake encounter by a police party headed by suspended SSP Rao Anwar.
Nusrat Hussain Mangan, Inspector General Prison has submitted their affidavit by stating that Sindh home department on April 21, had sent a notification to the then IG Prisons declaring house N, 599, Street No 13, Askari-V, Malir Cantonment Karachi as “Sub-Jail” for under-trail prison (UTP), as their confinement in central prison Karachi is very risky from security point of view, due to shortage of staff and the jail is already over-populated having 4800 prisoners. Muhammad Hasan Sahito, senior superintendent of central prison, has also submitted their affidavit, wherein they submitted that same statements. The counsel, representing the main suspect, Rao Anwar, remained absence.
The adjourned the hearing and directed the defense counsel to appear in the next hearing with their statements. The then SSP Malir along with their subordinates has been facing trial before an antiterrorism court for allegedly killing Naseem Ullah, better known as Naqeebullah Mehsud and three others in a staged encounter on Jan 13 in a Malir locality.
Mohammad Khan, father of Naqeeb, through their lawyer moved the SHC challenging a notification of declaring ex SSP Malir Rao Anwar house a sub-jail.
The petitioner contended that on April 21, when Rao Anwar was sent to prison on judicial remand by trial court, the home department had issued a notification declaring their house sub-jail and such remarkable speed clearly indicated that it was issued with mala fide intentions and even otherwise, clearly showed that it must have been pre-dated.
The petitioner further submitted that such favouritism and nepotism in favour of the suspended SSP was clearly mala fide since the notification failed to disclose any credible information regarding serious threats to their life. Impleading the home department, jail authorities and Rao Anwar as respondents, they maintained that Rao's detention in their own home was simply a continuation of the VVIP treatment being accorded to them and pleaded to declare the notification illegal.
Following the court proceeding, the petitioner, Muhammad Khan talked to the media and condemned the affidavits submitted by the higher authorities of prison.
They said that their statement is shocking and it proved that the authorities want to protect Rao Anwar, they added that if there is security risk, shortage of staff and overcrowding issues are in jail, so other prisoners should also be confined to their house and declare them sub jails.
Mayor: Fort Myers has handle on former toxic dump
FORT MYERS, Fla. Residents near a former toxic dump site in Dunbar have nothing to worry about, Mayor Randy Henderson said.
“We're doing way better. We've got a handle on it,” they said. “I know that once the city learned about it that measures were taken to make sure that it's safe.”
But people near the site where sludge from a water treatment plant was disposed of are upset they're only now finding out about it.
“I've been living here like 45 years,” Lee County NAACP president James Muwakkil said. “I know the area. I used to play in the area. No one ever came out and said hey, we have a site that's pretty hazardous. Stay away from it.”
The city bought the land in 1962, before homes started going up around it, and used the site as a dumping ground until sometime in the 1980s, even after homes were built.
Arsenic was found 10 years ago in the soil on the land, which is bounded by Henderson Avenue on the west, Midway Avenue on the east, Jeffcott Street on the south and South Street on the north.
No hazardous levels of arsenic remain, nor is there any existing threat to groundwater, the Department of Environmental Protection said, citing recent tests.
But the damage to nearby residents may already have been done, Muwakkil said.
The NAACP intends to keep pressure on the city as city leaders and the DEP work to figure out a use for the vacant land. Henderson is examining the possibility of building a fence around it.
“The main thing is making sure that it's safe and that it continues to remain safe, and if that's the case, and it's my understanding that it is, then we can determine its long term future,” Henderson said. “That task is put squarely on the city management's back and we look forward to seeing what options and possibilities are available.”
The land will be tested again for toxins in September 2018.
Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Wednesday they will appoint Jerry Foxhoven as the new director of Iowa Department of Human Service. They will replace Charles Palmer, who announced their retirement last month.
The department has been scrutinized for months over its handling of child abuse cases, particularly cases involving the deaths of two teenage girls.
Foxhoven, 64, began practicing law in 1977 until 2000 when they became the administrator for the Iowa Child Advocacy Board. While in this position, they were also the director of both Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) and Iowa Citizen Foster Care Review Board programs; two child welfare advocacy programs.
In 2006, Foxhoven became the director of the Joan & Lyle Middleton Center for Children's Rights. During this position, they also instructed juvenile law at Drake Law School.
Foxhoven has held over 15 leadership roles in child protection and earned more than 10 awards for their work.
New Delhi: The Congress on Wednesday appointed Dinesh Gundu Rao as the chief of its Karnataka unit, replacing G Parameshwara, who has since become the deputy chief minister in the new coalition government in the state.
Gundu Rao (48) was earlier the working president of the Karnataka Congress under Parameshwara. The five-time MLA from the Gandhinagar constituency in Bengaluru was the food and civil supplies minister in the previous Congress government in the southern state.
I thank @INCIndia President @RahulGandhi ji for appointing me as President, @INCKarnataka PCC. Along with @eshwar_khandre, we will strengthen the party & will try to live upto the expectations of all the leaders & workers. — Dinesh Gundu Rao (@dineshgrao) July 4, 2018
Congress president Rahul Gandhi also appointed Eshwar Khandre, an MLA, as the new working president of the party's Karnataka unit.
I thank @INCIndia President Shri. @RahulGandhi for appointing @dineshgrao as KPCC President and me as Working President. On this occasion I will promise you that, I will make all efforts to take @INCKarnataka to a new height. https://t.co/EsRat3W9TK — Eshwar Khandre (@eshwar_khandre) July 4, 2018
All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Ashok Gehlot made the announcements in a statement.
"The Congress party appreciates the hard work done by G Parameshwara, who successfully led the party for the last eight years and is stepping down from their responsibility," the statement added.
The changes in the Karnataka Congress were in the offing after the Congress-JD(S) coalition government was formed in the state in May.
The changes are also part of Gandhi's efforts to bring in a new team of young leaders to steer the party at the central and state levels.

Liverpool forwards are focused on the club's progress and under no pressure to match playmaker Mohamed Salah's goal-scoring exploits this season, striker Roberto Firmino has said.
Egyptian Salah leads the race for the European Golden Shoe award, ahead of Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, after notching an impressive 36 goals and 12 assists in 41 appearances across all competitions in their debut season at Liverpool.
"No way! We have very good chemistry here at Liverpool," Firmino told Goal when asked if they felt any burden of expectations to equal their teammate's goal-scoring run.
"Many speak of the strength of our attack, which also has (Sadio) Mane, but we have a team full of great quality that is effective in attack.
"We have to think collectively. The more players score, the better. Liverpool is the ones who win in this situation."
Firmino has scored 23 goals this season while Mane netted 14 as Liverpool lead the Champions League goal-scoring charts with 28 so far and their tally of 73 goals in the Premier League is second only to that of leaders Manchester City.
The high-scoring Merseyside club, who are third in the league, will meet rivals City in a mouth-watering Champions League quarter-final tie next month.
Firmino also said that compatriot Philippe Coutinho's move to Barcelona in January had changed the way Liverpool play and made them more unpredictable.
Liverpool travels to Crystal Palace in the league on 31 March.
Pottstown, PA (February 13, 2017) — In the latest installment of Manatawny Still Works' Small Batch Whiskey Series, the suburban Philadelphia distiller has created BATCH13, a blend of several casks of the distillery's Keystone Whiskey finished in a 59-gallon port barrel from Gandona Estate Winery.
The Small Batch Whiskey Series is an opportunity for head distiller Max Pfeffer to experiment. Each batch is a chance to try out different mash bills, vary the time aged or adjust the proof of the spirit. And in the case of BATCH13, it is a chance to age the whiskey in port barrels.
“Collaborative efforts like this give us the opportunity to bring exciting product to market and expose consumers to something different,” Pfeffer said.
In partnership with Gandona Estate Winery in Napa, California, the distillery has used Gandona's Fraga Do Arco port casks to finish the small batch offering. The port influence is prevalent throughout the whiskey, with notes of cherry and other big fruits. The whiskey portrays sweetness with notes of malt, oak, showcasing flavors from the port casks.
BATCH13 will be released at the distillery on Saturday, February 18th at 12 p.m. for $44.99. BATCH13 will also see limited distribution through Pennsylvania and Maryland at bars and restaurants that support Manatawny Still Works.

NOSE: Oak, Cherries, Raisin, Caramel, Cinnamon
PALATE: Port, Oak, Vanilla, Chocolate, Big Fruit
FINISH Tannins, Jam, Bitter-Sweet Chocolate
COMMENTS: In partnership with Gandona Estate Winery in Napa, we've used their Fraga Do Arco port casks to finish this small batch offering.

NZ Coach Services to take on threatened Hutt Valley commuter bus routes
JARED NICOLL/STUFF Hutt Valley commuters would need to catch other buses, such as the 120 (pictured), to connect to other trains and buses into Wellington if direct services were not saved. (File photo)
A local company has come to the rescue of three threatened commuter bus services between the Hutt Valley and Wellington.
But their futures will still depend on usage, with the company set to review the services in three months.
Hutt City councillor Campbell Barry said NZ Coach Services, based in Taita, Lower Hutt, will take over the Wainuiomata, Stokes Valley and Upper Hutt commuter buses from current operator NZ Bus from June 18.
SUPPLIED Hutt City councillor Campbell Barry said a local company running the services was a step in the right direction. (File photo)
NZ Bus signalled earlier this year it would stop operating the privately-run services after it lost the majority of its commuter bus contracts in the Wellington region from July.

* Bus services to be retained
* Hutt Valley-airport bus could be scrapped
* Petition to save Flyer bus
* More Hutt buses could go
Barry said the services had since been sold to NZ Coach Services, which would itself review the arrangement in three months.
Hutt South MP Chris Bishop has challenged commuters to show demand is there for the services. (File photo)
"From what they've told me, the plan is to keep all of those services running as they currently are."
While the services were not yet secured long-term Barry said the signs were now more positive.
"This is a really good step in the right direction. Having a company based in Hutt Valley providing these services moving forward is a good thing and provides a bit more certainty."
MAARTEN HOLL/STUFF The Airport Flyer, which runs between Lower Hutt and Wellington Airport, is still run by NZ Bus. (File photo)
Hutt South MP Chris Bishop said it was up to the people of the Hutt Valley to ensure the services were retained.
"My sense is they're very strongly supported, and I encourage people to get on the bus and use them."
When asked if having a local company running the services would help secure their future, Bishop said: "Let's just wait and see".
"I think it's good news. The point is we just need these services to continue, they're very valuable and well used.
"It was always going to be tricky for NZ Bus to keep them going from an economic point of view having lost the bulk of their Hutt Valley contracts. It's nice to see a local company pick them up."
A petition to save the services, along with the Airport Flyer bus from Lower Hutt to Wellington Airport, had earlier attracted 18,000 signatures.
Bishop said at the time that, while there were other services which operated between Wellington and the Hutt Valley, they were already stretched and were not as direct as the buses NZ Bus had proposed to cut.
NZ bus is still operating the Airport Flyer service.

The factory building had been expanded illegally, with additional floors stacked one on top of another. An engineer had declared it unsafe, and the thousands of people who worked inside, stitching garments for clothing brands from around the world, knew it was trouble. "That factory was very risky," said Khadiza Begum, who was working at Rana Plaza the day the complex collapsed, five years ago Tuesday. "It had weak pillars, it had narrow stairwells, it had no fire exits."
"We saw cracks in the building before it collapsed on us," they said.
The tragedy killed 1,134 people, many of them young women supporting extended families, and injured more than 2,500. It focused international attention on Bangladesh's role as the world's second-largest garment producer, and led the government and manufacturing associations to promise big improvements. Many of the world's top clothing brands said they would stop contracting with factories if they failed to improve safety for their workers. Five years later, the situation is complicated, according to a recent study conducted by the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University's Stern School of Business.
"We have found tremendous improvement in the larger factories," that have signed onto two major safety programs organized by foreign brands, Paul Barrett, deputy director of the center, said in an email. "But two other categories -factories overseen by the government and subcontracting facilities not overseen by anyone -remain at risk."
The center's survey of conditions at Bangladesh's textile factories, found that workers at about 3,000 of the country's 7,000 factories are still exposed to life-threatening risks, ranging from a lack of fire safety equipment to serious structural flaws. The dangerous factories are often small, but sometimes subcontract work from larger factories that deal with foreign brands. Those factories rarely allow access for journalists, though the best-equipped factories are eager to show off their workplaces. S.M. Khaled is the managing director of the Snowtex Outerwear Ltd. Factory, a $42 million complex built after the 2013 disaster in the industrial suburb of Dhamrai, outside the capital Dhaka.
"The collapse of Rana Plaza was a wake-up call for us -for the industry and for the buyers," they said as they walked through the factory. "Look at my factory. Look around. I have done my best to keep it safe for the workers."
Textile exports are a huge business for Bangladesh, bringing in $28 billion annually, mostly from to Europe and the United States. Industry insiders guardedly admit that subcontracting remains an issue in the garment industry, with larger businesses sometimes contracting some work to smaller, less-safe factories. They insist those deals are being phased out.
Khaled said the established factories know they are being monitored by the international brands, and don't want to get in trouble by subcontracting. Worker safety should not depend on where the clothing is being worn, Roy Ramesh Chandra, president of Bangladesh's United Federation of Garment Workers, said in an interview.
"Authorities need to address all the factories -whether it is producing for export" or for Bangladeshis.
Google Maps is an alternative mapping service to Apple's native Maps app. It's also got about a decade more experience under its belt. Though Apple Maps is a worthy adversary, and continues to improve constantly, Google Maps has been the go-to service for a lot of people. If you want to know more about Google Maps, here's everything you need to know. What's new with Google Maps? With Google's recent announcement and release of gaming APIs for Google Maps, which allow developers to better integrate real world locations into their games, three previously-announced augmented reality games have been revealed to be powered by Google Maps. Jurassic World Alive places AR dinosaurs at real locations, marked on the game's map, which you can go and find by heading to that location in the real world, much like Pokémon Go, with some dinosaurs also existing exclusively in a single specific geographic location. The Walking Dead: Our World is an action game that pits you against walkers in real-world environments, fighting beside AR companion characters, and giving you the ability to explore to find nests of walkers, new weapons, and other collectibles. Finally, Ghostbusters World takes a similar path, letting you find ghosts to bust on the game map, sending you to real locations to fight and then trap your spectral enemies in augmented reality. These games are all due out later this year. What is Google Maps?
Google Maps features driving, walking, and transit directions for both the iPhone and iPad, complete with voice guided GPS navigation. Google Maps is available in over 220 countries and territories with transit directions included for over 15,000 major cities around the world. Google Maps also comes with Google's popular Street View feature built right in to help you find exactly what you're looking for. It gives real-time estimated time of arrival using current traffic conditions and provides alternate faster routes whenever possible, even during mid-travel. You can use Google Maps to get you around town when walking, biking, taking public transportation, and even hailing a ride from Uber or Lyft. How to get Google Maps on your iPhone or iPad Google Maps is an iOS app available in the App Store for free. You don't have to sign up or subscribe. You can use Google Maps anonymously, or by signing in with your Google account. Download in the App Store How do I sync my Google account to Google Maps? If you have a Google account (like from Gmail, Hangouts, Google Play, or YouTube), you can sign in with your Google credentials and keep your data synced across all devices you use, including Macs and PCs, Windows phones, and Android phones. Depending on what permissions you give, you can save maps you've searched for on your computer, get directions to someone in your Contacts, and save favorite locations to easily find in the future. If your Google account is already synced with your iPhone, it will automatically appear in Google Maps. You can also sign in manually.

NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Profit forecasts for 2018 are rising fast as analysts factor in benefits from the U.S. tax overhaul, a trend that could temper worries about rising interest rates in the near term.
Wall Street's main indexes on Friday were headed for their worst week in two years as rates soared in the bond market and renewed fears of inflation gripped investors. But amid the selloff, one of the fundamental factors that drives stock prices - corporate earnings - keeps improving.
Earnings season is in full swing and with half of the S&P 500 companies still to report fourth-quarter results and potentially give guidance on 2018, profit estimates are likely to increase further.
The upward trajectory of forecasts has caught the attention of investors anxious to see signs that earnings can support lofty stock valuations and offset concerns over rising bond yields and the pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Rising rates in general mean higher borrowing costs for companies.
The S&P 500 is up roughly 4 percent so far this year, even after giving back gains this week, and rose 19.4-percent in 2017. Whether this week's downturn in global equity markets continues will depend in part on upcoming earnings reports.
“Stocks may have been overbought, and some of that was alleviated this week. Earnings are still rising and cash flow is still rising,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Reports from both Apple and Google parent Alphabet late Thursday disappointed investors, as did Friday's results from ExxonMobil and Chevron. But fourth-quarter S&P 500 results overall have been much stronger than expected.
Among changes to the tax law, the corporate income tax rate drops to 21 percent from 35 percent, so earnings estimates for the first quarter and all of 2018 have jumped, according to Thomson Reuters data.
First-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies is now estimated at 17.7 percent, up from 11.7 percent on Dec. 20, when both houses of Congress approved the tax revamp. Earnings growth for 2018 is now forecast at 18.2 percent, up from 11.5 percent on Dec. 20.
Typically, expectations decline as the earnings reporting season for the quarter approaches. On average, profit growth expectations fall by 4 percentage points from the start of the quarter to the start of earnings season, said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.
This January, there were 4.3 times more positive than negative revisions to S&P 500 2018 earnings estimates, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The one-month ratio of upward to downward revisions was the highest since at least 1986, as far back as the bank's data goes.
Those upward revisions are likely to continue.
All of the S&P 500 companies together are expected to show earnings of about $155 per share this year in aggregate, up about $9 since Dec. 20, Thomson Reuters' estimates show.
The tax reform benefit is estimated to add more than that, however - a full $13 - which suggests there “there is more room to run,” BofA-ML strategists said in a note.
“Usually there isn't an event like this,” which affects so many companies at once, said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
In addition to the tax law, U.S. companies' earnings are benefiting from improving global economic demand and the weaker U.S. dollar, which helps U.S. multinationals, they said.
Those factors could help to underpin U.S. earnings even after the tax benefit is priced in.
“We step back and look and so far earnings have been awful good,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.
Among companies due to report next week are Walt Disney , General Motors, several biotech companies including Gilead and restaurants including Chipotle Mexican Grill.

HUDDERSFIELD TOWN head ocach David Wagner says their team are only focused on sealing their play-off place following their draw at Derby County.
The Yorkshire side threw away two vital points after ex-Town midfielder Jacob Butterfield's deflected strike drew the Rams level with two minutes remaining.
Town had led since the ninth minute after Collin Quaner scored their second goal in as many games.
It leaves the Terriers seven points behind Newcastle in the race for automatic promotion, but the German boss says Huddersfield are only interested in getting the points needed to make the play-offs.
Wagner said: “If we secure a play-off spot then we will be very happy. We are humble and we know how difficult it is to get points in this division.
“We are Huddersfield Town and to have this points total is an unbelievable achievement. We have to focus on ourselves and not Newcastle.
We are Huddersfield Town and to have this points total is an unbelievable achievement. Huddersfield Town manager, David Wagner
“We are in a wonderful position, but we do not have enough points yet. We would like to have more points and we would like more good performances.
“We took a step in the right direction with this performance. This is an unbelievable season for Huddersfield Town.
“Of course we are disappointed because the equaliser was late, but I am pleased as we managed the game well.
“I am totally okay with the performance because this is not an easy place to come. We kept them away from our goal for most of the game by using a different idea to our usual one. We deserved the draw.
“If we are in the play-offs, it will be very important to manage the away games against good opponents.”
Derby manager Gary Rowett said their side had got just reward for their battling spirit.
They said: “Overall we had control of the game. Our goalkeeper had nothing to do, but their goal.”
Derby County: Carson, Christie, Keogh, Pearce, Olsson, Ince (Camara 71), Hughes, Johnson (Butterfield 72), Anya,Vydra (Russell 72), Bent. Unused substitutes: Bryson, Baird, Lowe, Mitchell.
Huddersfield Town: Ward, Cranie (Smith 61), Hefele, Schindler, Lowe, Whitehead, Mooy, Lolley (Hogg 80), Kachunga, van La Parra (Wells 67), Quaner. Unused substitutes: Hudson, Scannell, Coleman, Payne.

The minutes of the 2018 ARRL Annual Board of Directors Meeting held January 19-20, 2018, are now available on the ARRL website.
On paper, the Arizona Coyotes had a tough week, as they lost two of three on home ice. However, when considering the fact that each of the three teams Arizona faced are fighting for playoff position in the Western Conference, it becomes clear that this team has continued to take steps forward.
Coyotes Competitive Against Top Teams
Following their hard-fought 1-0 shutout victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Mar. 11, the Coyotes opened last week with a matchup against the rival Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday at Gila River Arena. With starting goaltender Antti Raanta on the shelf due to an injury, and with backup netminder Darcy Kuemper under the weather with an illness, the goaltending duties fell to rookie Adin Hill, who was making their first NHL start since Oct. 26. Hill was outstanding in this one – they stopped 34 of the 37 Los Angeles shots they faced in regulation and overtime, and their teammates got them the win in the shootout after the rookie turned away four of five Kings skaters they faced in the skills contest.
The Coyotes remained at home on Thursday and hosted the hottest team in the league – the Nashville Predators. The Predators were riding a 12-game point streak entering the night (11-0-1), but Arizona surprisingly held a 2-1 lead after two periods. However, the Preds quickly showed why they have to be considered the favorites to repeat as Western Conference champions – they struck for two quick goals in less than five minutes in the third period and goaltender Pekka Rinne shut things down the rest of the way as they led their team to the 3-2 victory in Glendale.
On Saturday, Devan Dubnyk and the Minnesota Wild came to town looking to avenge two previous losses in which the Coyotes came from behind to earn victories. Despite Clayton Keller's 20th goal of the season during the second period, the Wild were indeed able to salvage a game in the season series, as Marcus Foligno scored the game-winner midway through the third period to give their team a 3-1 triumph.
Coyotes Hit the Road
After their loss to the Wild on Saturday, the Coyotes will remain at home and will finish up their five-game homestand on Monday night against Mike Smith and the Calgary Flames. Smith was recovering from a lower-body injury during Calgary's last visit to Glendale back on Feb. 22, so this will be their first time suiting up as a visitor at Gila River Arena since being traded over the offseason. However, Smith played on Sunday in a 4-0 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights, so it remains to be seen if he'll play on back-to-back nights. This one will get started at 7:00 P.M. in Glendale.
The Coyotes will then hit the road and will begin a six-game road trip on Wednesday in Buffalo against Jack Eichel and the Sabres. For the second time in four seasons, it appears as if the ‘Yotes and Sabres will finish as the two worst teams in the NHL, so this one could have major draft lottery implications when all is said and done. Will Sabres fans once again cheer against their team as they did in 2015, when the ‘prize' for finishing last was either Connor McDavid or Jack Eichel? Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. local time in the Queen City (4:00 P.M. in Arizona)
Arizona will then have a chance to play spoiler on Thursday night, when they'll travel to Carolina for a matchup against the Hurricanes. The ‘Canes made a late run to climb back into playoff contention in the Eastern Conference, but they've struggled as of late, and one or two more regulation losses might be all it takes to extinguish their postseason hopes. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. local time in Raleigh (4:00 P.M. in Arizona).
Another chance to play spoiler will follow on Saturday, when the Coyotes will travel to the Sunshine State to take on the Florida Panthers. Like Carolina, Florida also has made a run to get back into the playoff race in the East, but the Cats are in much better shape – they're just five points behind the New Jersey Devils with three games in hand. As of this writing, they control their own playoff destiny, but a loss or two could change everything. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. local time in Sunrise (4:00 P.M. in Arizona).
Pacific Division Roundup
The Vegas Golden Knights still lead the Pacific Division, but their lead has been trimmed to eight points with 10 games to play. Things could get interesting out West if the Knights' current slide continues.
Anaheim Ducks (37-24-12, 86 points)
Last week: 3-1-0 (4-2 L vs STL, 3-0 W vs VAN, 4-2 W vs DET, 4-2 W vs NJ)
3-1-0 (4-2 L vs STL, 3-0 W vs VAN, 4-2 W vs DET, 4-2 W vs NJ) Analysis: The Ducks won three times during last week's four-game homestand, and hold sole possession of the Pacific's No. 3 playoff spot entering the week as a result. Their dominance at the Pond this season has been well-documented, but they'll need to be much better on the road, especially when considering that five of their final nine are away from home.

Calgary Flames (35-28-10, 80 points)
Last week: 1-2-0 (1-0 W vs EDM, 7-4 L vs SJ, 4-0 L at VGK)
1-2-0 (1-0 W vs EDM, 7-4 L vs SJ, 4-0 L at VGK) Analysis: The Flames, just 3-6-1 in their last 10 games, are fading fast in the Pacific. They're four points behind the Kings for the final wild-card spot, and have both the Dallas Stars and St. Louis Blues in front of them. If Glen Gulutzan's squad is going to qualify for the playoffs, they'll need to earn it – six of the final nine games are against current playoff teams.

1-2-1 (1-0 L at CGY, 4-3 OTL vs SJ, 4-2 W at FLA, 3-1 L at TB) Analysis: The Oilers won just once last week, as Edmonton scored three third-period goals against the desperate Panthers en route to a 4-2 victory. In what has become a lost season, playing spoiler might be the only motivation Todd McLellan's squad has left.

2-1-1 (3-0 W vs VAN, 4-3 SOL at ARI, 4-1 W vs DET, 3-0 L vs NJ) Analysis: It was another up-and-down week for the Kings, who haven't won back-to-back games yet in the month of March. They enter this week hanging onto the West's final playoff spot only by virtue of tiebreakers. Needless to say, they'll need to string together a few wins in order to gain some separation from Dallas and St. Louis.

Eighteen climate scientists from the U.S. and elsewhere hit the jackpot Monday as French President Emmanuel Macron awarded them millions of euros in grants to relocate to France for the rest of Donald Trump's presidential term
Comments
The pound reached its highest level against the US dollar since last week's General Election, as weaker American inflation and retail sales data weighed on the greenback.
Sterling shot up 0.4% versus the US dollar to reach 1.280 for the first time since June 8, but fell 0.16% versus the euro to trade at 1.135.
Sterling's ascent against the greenback weighed on listed multinationals on the FTSE 100, which tend to benefit when foreign currencies are stronger. London's blue chip index fell 0.35% or 26.04 points at 7,474.4.
US data released on Tuesday showed inflation contracting by 0.1% in May, while month-on-month retail sales fell by 0.3%.
Investors were also awaiting an interest rate decision from the US Federal Reserve.
Jasper Lawler, a senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: "A double dose of soft economic data sent the US dollar plunging and gold rallying before the Federal Reserve rate decision.
"Slowing inflation and flat retail sales add to the growing sense that today's meeting could see the last US rate rise this year."
Across Europe, the French Cac 40 fell into the red to end the day down 0.35%, while the German Dax rose 0.3%.
In oil markets, Brent crude prices tumbled 2.8% to 46.88 US dollars per barrel as Energy Information Administration (EIA) data pointed to larger than expected US gas and crude inventories and forecast that energy supplies from non-Opec members would outstrip demand next year.
Commodity stocks followed crude prices lower to hold the bottom spots on the FTSE 100.
Anglo American fell 28.5p to 1,059p, while Glencore dropped 7.65p to 286.65p, and Rio Tinto slumped 75p to 3,142.5p.
Elsewhere, Mulberry Group shares tumbled 49p to 1,100p despite reporting a 21% rise in annual pre-tax profits to £7.5 million and an 8% rise in revenue.
Experts said investors were disappointed by weak like-for-like sales at the start of the new financial year.
WHSmith shares jumped 47p to 1,791p as the retailer reported an 8% rise in total sales in the 15 weeks to June 10, while Gemfields shares surged 5.25p to 40.75p after Chinese conglomerate Fosun tabled a £220 million takeover offer for the Faberge owner.
Shares in Bellway jumped 170p to 3,020p as the housebuilder reported a 13% rise in reservation rates in the four months to June despite General Election jitters.
Waste management firm Biffa saw shares slump 2.75p to 193.25p after reporting an £18.7 million annual pre-tax loss, weighed down by the cost of its stock market flotation.
TalkTalk climbed 6.9p to 175.4p. The telecoms giant revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that former boss Dido Harding earned £1.1 million in annual pay and bonuses, just weeks after warning over profits.
The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were Barratt Developments up 18.5p to 594p, Centrica up 5.9p to 202.9p, Direct Line Insurance Group up 10.4p to 364.3p, and Old Mutual up 5.5p to 204.7p.
The biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were Anglo American down 28.5p to 1,059p, Glencore down 7.65p to 286.65p, Rio Tinto down 75p to 3,142.5p, and BP down 8.55p to 461.6p.
NEWARK, N.J.—A former Rutgers University professor whose conviction for sexually assaulting a disabled man was overturned pleaded guilty Monday to aggravated criminal sexual contact. Anna Stubblefield entered their plea Monday as part of a deal with Essex County prosecutors in New Jersey. They admitted they should have known the man was legally unable to consent, but declined further comment following the hearing. Prosecutors will recommend Stubblefield receives a four-year prison term when she's sentenced May 7, and they will get credit for the prison time they already have served.

Stubblefield, who once chaired Rutgers-Newark's philosophy department, testified at trial that they and the man fell in love after they were brought on by their family to help them communicate. Stubblefield said they consented to the relationship by communicating on a keyboard, but prosecutors said Stubblefield used their position to take advantage of the then-29-year-old man, who has cerebral palsy and can't speak. Stubblefield was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. But an appeals court ruled last June that they should get a new trial with a new judge because the trial judge erred by barring testimony from an expert witness for the defence. Stubblefield's lawyer argued that the expert would have convinced jurors the man could consent to sex. The expert had done a three-day evaluation of the man that included “facilitated communication,” a technique that uses a trained person to assist a disabled person, usually with typing.
The trial judge determined facilitated communication is an “unrecognized field of science.” The appellate panel found that because jurors couldn't hear the expert's full assessment of the man, they were left with the impression that no one — apart from Stubblefield themselves — believed they had the mental abilities to consent to sex. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who are the alleged victims of sex crimes. Stubblefield, 48, was married with children when their relationship with the man developed. They met them in 2009 through their brother, who had been taking a college course from them Over the next two years, they worked with them using facilitated communication. They argued that they could communicate by typing. The man's family sued Stubblefield and won a $4 million judgment over their treatment of him.

This statement was originally published on rsf.org on 18 May 2018.
After journalists were endangered by this week's heavy fighting between the Taliban and Afghan army in Farah, capital of the western province of Farah, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reiterates its concern about the decline in the security situation for journalists and media outlets throughout Afghanistan and lists the country's press freedom predators.
Taliban forces attacked and entered part of the city of Farah shortly after midnight on 15 May 2018 after an offensive outside the city that had intensified over a period of several days. The Taliban attack put many local journalists and media outlets in direct danger.
At least 30 journalists are based in the city, working for two TV channels (one commercial, one public), five radio stations, two newspapers and for national media. Farah province was already regarded as one of the most dangerous in Afghanistan.
RSF has tried to help find a solution for the safety of Farah's journalists, working with local journalists' associations and the authorities. "Until now, no attack on media outlets and journalists has been reported," a journalist inside the city told RSF. "Most have found a refuge, while waiting for the city to be secured."
The Afghan authorities meanwhile report that army reinforcements have been sent to the city and claim that the situation is under control.
Mounting death toll
According to RSF's tally, a total of 36 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of 2016 in Afghanistan in bombings and other forms of violence by the country's two main press freedom predators, the Taliban and Islamic State (Daesh).
Other journalists have been the victims of violence by the police and security services in various parts of the country. Militias working for provincial strongmen and governors also threaten and harass media outlets and journalists.
"We call on the authorities to do their duty to ensure the safety of journalists and respect for the right to inform," said Reza Moini, the head of RSF's Iran-Afghanistan desk. "The government must regulate the militias, which nowadays plays a major role in harassment of the media. We also deplore the mistrust and accusatory attitude that the police and military display towards the media and journalists, endangering the freedom to inform. The authorities must end the threats to the media and the impunity for those who attack journalists."
At least 11 dead in a single week
Last month, ten journalists were killed in a single day - 30 April. Nine of them were killed in a double suicide bombing in Kabul, the second of which deliberately targeted the media. It was the deadliest single attack on the media since the fall of the Taliban regime in December 2001 and was claimed shortly afterwards by Islamic State.
The tenth journalist to be killed on 30 April was Ahmad Shah, a journalist with the BBC's Pashto section, who was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in eastern Khost province. The police investigated the murder and the province's governor, Hokam Khan Habibi, announced on 10 May that the killers had been arrested and would soon be brought to trial. They also called Shah's murder a "terrorist act" but did not elaborate.
Abdulmanan Arghand, a journalist with the Kabul News commercial TV channel, was gunned down on 25 April in the southern province of Kandahar. RSF learned that the Kandahar police had warned them on 5 March of an imminent Taliban threat against them and their father because of their anti-Taliban activities. Arghand met on 13 and 15 March with the Kandahar police chief (the provincial head of the National Directorate of Security), who confirmed the threat. In a phone message afterwards, Arghand expressed their concern and their dissatisfaction with these meetings.
The Kandahar police chief announced on 26 April that a "Taliban member" had been arrested for murdering Arghand, and the police released a video in which they made a full confession. Taliban spokesperson Zbiollah Mojahed nonetheless insisted that the detainee was not a Taliban member and that the Taliban were conducting their own investigation into the Arghand murder. They also denied any Taliban role in the Shah murder.
Threat from unofficial militias
The past year has seen a major increase in attacks on journalists, who are targeted not only by the Taliban and Islamic State, which seek to enforce their hatred of press freedom, but also by the police and army and by the unofficial militias.
These militias act as enforcers for warlords and strongmen in various parts of the countries. They are armed by the government or by ruling politicians and their main job is to resist and combat armed opposition groups, above all, the Taliban. But many journalists say that most of these militias have also become one of the main sources of danger to the media.
Where the forces of the state are either powerless or absent, these militias are the new masters, confiscating land, taxing cars on the main highways and pressuring the media to say nothing. Covering the criminal activities of these groups is out of the question, even for the national media.
In several regions, they even collaborate with those they are supposed to combat, namely the Taliban, especially in Ghor province, where two radio stations were recently destroyed, and in Najrab, a village in Kapisa province, where the head of one of these militias is also a senior member of the parliamentary committee on national security. In some provinces, such as Balkh, it is not uncommon for influential individuals, including the former governor, to have their own private armies.
Ghazni is a good example of the situation now prevailing for journalists. In Ghazni, journalists are harassed by the Taliban, whose presence in the province is growing, by the security forces, which want to control media coverage for security reasons, and by the unofficial militias, which suppress any independent reporting.
"The threat from these armed groups has compounded the threats already imposed by influential politicians, the mullahs, the police and the governor, although they have no official power, legally," a Ghazni province journalist told RSF on condition of anonymity. "It is irresponsible of the government to tolerate the illegal actions of these groups."
The level of impunity is high in the regions controlled by these militias. There has been little progress in the investigation into the attacks on two radio stations in Firuzkoh, the capital of Ghor province – Sedai Edelat (Voice of Justice) on 21 January 2018 and Radio Sarhad (Frontier) on 23 December 2017. Abdlvodod Samim, the journalist who was at Sedai Edelat when it was attacked, was arrested by the police as the main suspect although the station's director and many other journalists insist that they were not involved. The police do not as yet have any other leads.
Harassed by governors, police and army
Three National Directorate of Security agents used force to prevent four journalists - 1TV's Farhad Joya, the news agency Khohandej's Nazir Ayoubi, and Firouz Mashouf and Yahya Fouladi from the commercial TV channel Tamadon - from covering an Islamic State attack on a mosque in the western city of Herat on 25 March. Although an official communiqué condemned the action of these three agents, no measures were taken against them, the journalists say.
When Radio Salam Watandar reporter Erfan Barzegar went to police headquarters in the northeastern province of Takhar on 29 March to do a report on terrorism, they resisted the provincial counter-terrorism chief's attempts to intimidate him, with the result that they were threatened with arrest and imprisonment. It was only thanks to the presence of other officials that they avoided being jailed.
Farhad Tuhidi was beaten by police in Herat on 15 March for trying to cover a road accident for which the military were to blame. After filming a brawl between police officers during the Nowruz (Persian New Year) festivities in Ghor province on 23 March, Radio Salam Watandar's Marouf Seiedi was themselves beaten by police officers, with police chief Ziaedin Sagheb's support after Sagheb had arrived at the scene. Ghotbedin Khohi was insulted and hit by special security forces in Meymaneh, Faryab province, on 25 March just for filming a street.
The Coordinating Committee for the Safety of Journalists and Media reported in a statement on 7 April that, of the 1,072 cases of violence against journalists registered during the past 15 years, only 172 had been investigated and, of these, 68 were closed without any action being taken. The investigation into three murders of journalists – in Balkh in 2005, Nangarhar in 2008 and Helmand in 2009 ­– are still open.
Afghanistan is ranked 118th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index.
Morney Wing flies home for Sussex National win
Report: Plumpton, Monday
At The Races Sussex National Handicap Chase 3m4½f, 5yo+
PADDY BRENNAN made the most of a spare ride on Morney Wing as they guided the eight-year-old to a comfortable success in the marathon handicap chase.
Morney Wing jumped and travelled well throughout the 3m4½f contest and registered a one-and-three-quarter-length success under Brennan, who had stepped into the breach when intended rider Noel Fehily was unable to take the mount as they were feeling unwell.
Dawson City stuck to their task to finish a creditable runner-up, while Azure Fly was a further two lengths back in third but neither could live with the Charlie Mann-trained winner.
Brennan said: "He was unbelievable. They did everything so easily and I probably ended up getting there too soon, but they were going so well I didn't want to take them back.
"I was having so much fun out there. They were absolutely mustard."

Two major opposition parties Monday demanded the annulment of Turkey's constitutional referendum, charging that the rules for counting ballots were changed illegally in the midst of voting.
International observers issued a scathing report, saying the campaign took place on an “unlevel playing field” and that the rules for organizing the referendum were not up to international standards.
The combined effect seriously tarnished President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's close victory in the vote on Sunday, which replaces a century-old parliamentary democracy with a “presidential system” that greatly expands the president's authority and would allow Erdoğan to serve for another 15 years in office.

“This referendum will take its place in the dark pages of history,” said Bulent Tezcan, the deputy leader of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP. “This referendum will always be remembered as illegitimate.”
The CHP, which was founded by the father of modern Turkey, Kemal Attaturk, and the predominantly Kurdish People's Democratic Party, both called for annulment of the result, which gave a majority of 51.41% to 48.59% to the package of 18 constitutional amendments.
Their primary complaint was that ballots are required by law to have the stamp of the Supreme Board of Elections to be valid, but the board decreed midway through the voting that unstamped papers were valid unless there was clear evidence of fraud. The CHP said at least 1 million ballots were stamped after they were handed in. That's close to the winning margin for “yes,” which according to unofficial results received 24.3 million votes, compared to 23.2 million for “no” votes.

The report by the international referendum observer mission said the legal framework for the vote was inadequate for a genuinely democratic referendum. It also faulted Turkish authorities for holding the vote during a state of emergency, under which the government issued decrees that affected the outcome but could not be challenged.
The observers, who represent the key bodies setting human rights standards for Europe and beyond, were scathing about the Turkish government's conduct during the campaign. Erdoğan's active involvement along with national and local officials made the campaign “imbalanced,” their preliminary report said. They complained of the “misuse of administrative resources,” police intervention against “no” campaigners and a decree that gave an enormous advantage to Erdoğan's campaign for a “yes” vote in print and broadcast media.

“These violations contravene OSCE commitments, Council of Europe standards and other international obligations regarding freedom and equality in the campaign,” it said, referring to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an intergovernmental body that regularly reviews human rights practices in Europe and beyond.
Erdoğan, who's long sought to create a “presidential system,” Monday visited the tombs of three former Turkish prime ministers, Turgut Ozal, Adnan Menderes and Necmettin Erbakan, all of whom favored a stronger presidency in Turkey.

Mother of fallen athlete pushes for more than ‘recommendations' on FHSAA agenda
The mother of a 16-year-old boy who died from a heat stoke during football practice is pushing for more than just “recommendations” on the Florida High School Athletic Association's agenda.
Riverdale High School student Zachary Polsenberg was running drills when they suddenly collapsed on the field in June 2017. The teen suffered from internal injuries and fell into a coma after their core temperature was at 107 degrees for more than half an hour.
Zachary's mother, Laurie Giordano, has since been working to keep other children safe while playing sports out in the sun — especially during the summer.
Giordano wants to take current heat-related rules further by extending the Florida High School Athletic Association's policies year-round and requiring heat prevention equipment near all fields.
Giordano said they are pushing for, “The mandatory use of a wet bulb globe thermometer which would measure the heat stress on their particular practice field,” and “The use of cold water immersion tubs.”
While these items could've saved Zachary's life, they're now listed as recommendations on the upcoming agenda — not policies.
“I am disheartened, disappointed and frankly and honestly I feel like they're telling me that Zach's death is not important to them,” Giordano said. “The horror of all this is there's very basic first aid steps that are available, but they're not required though.”
But Giordano said they will continue to fight to prevent another family's nightmare.
Some of the association's rules already in place include: taking breaks for water and rest, and cooling-off in shaded areas with helmets off.
WINK News reached out to the association about the family's concerns, but has yet to hear back.

Officers at the Marigot Police Station have said the station is in a terrible condition Hurricane Maria and they feel abandoned by the Police High Command.
The roof of the building where the station is housed was blown away by the storm and officers say since then no repairs have been made.
Police sources at the station told DNO that after the storm they were visited by Deputy Police Chief Davidson Valerie and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of National Security Jo-Anne Commodore but nothing has been done.
The officers say water from the roof is a major problem whenever it rains.
Added to that that the station is infested with mold and mosquitos.
One officer has fallen sick twice because of the conditions and others have been complaining of severe coughs.
Other institutions operating in the building, such as the Treasury Department and Magistrate's Court, have been relocated but the police station remains.
“The situation is bad, we feel abandoned,” one officer told DNO.
DNO was told that other police stations on the east coast that received damage during Maria have been repaired, while the Marigot Police Station remains untouched.
The officers are now calling on Police Chief Daniel to visit the station to witness the conditions himself.

This is the incredible moment a hero police officer saved a baby from choking to death.
Two-month-old Zeona had turned blue while they were drinking from their bottle so their frantic grandma Kianna Dorsey called police pleading for help.
Sergeant Nick St Onge, who is with Marietta Police Department in Georgia, USA, responded to the call at a nearby car park where they found Kianna holding the baby.
“She only had a bottle,” Dorsey is heard saying in the video. “That's all they had.”
Sergeant St Onge took the little girl from them and gently started patting them back as Kianna looked on terrified.
“There we go. Come on, baby. Come on,” Sergeant St Onge can be heard saying to them
After a few minutes the youngster begins crying and breathing again.
Paramedics are seen tending to the little girl as everyone smiles in relief.
Sergeant St Onge told InsideEdition.com : “During my drive there, I'm reviewing in my head the CPR training I've received.
“What am I going to do when I get there?
"I'm kind of developing a mindset, a game plan for how I envision things going.”
Officer St. Onge said that they used training from their nine years in the Marine Corps during the incident on May 15 in Marietta, Georgia.
“The training I had just kicked in, and I just went to work,” they said. “I started doing back blows and chest compressions.”
Several minutes later, they heard the baby let out a small cry.
It was “just this half cry from the baby, who up until that point hadn't made a sound,” they said.
“Right as the fire department was pulling up and EMS was pulling up, the baby started coming back around and started to cry a little more.”
The little girl is said to be recovering well from the incident.
Earlier this month dramatic dashcam footage caught the moment Florida officer Jeremie Nix swerved off the road to help a three-month-old baby who had stopped breathing.

Mum Nechole Crowell is seen jumping out the vehicle in a panic and thrusting their baby Kingston towards Deputy Nix, who then tries to revive the youngster with CPR and other life-saving measures.
But when they noticed Kingston wasn't improving they rushed Kingston back into their vehicle and took them to the nearby Ocala Regional Medical Center.
Doctors were then able to stabilise Kingston - and said the little boy would've died if it wasn't for the actions of Deputy Nix, who works for the force's K9 police dog unit in Ocala.

Bitcoin futures started trading on Sunday, in what marked the virtual currency's debut on a major U.S. stock exchange.
The futures are being offered by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, and allow investors to bet on the future price of Bitcoin without having to hold any digital tokens, as the contracts are settled in cash.
READ MORE: Bitcoin futures rise as virtual currency makes debut on major exchange
Futures trading is for the pros, though, so what does this mean for all the small investors who've piled into Bitcoin?
A less volatile Bitcoin?
A futures market “could make Bitcoin itself less volatile,” said Joshua Gans, who holds the Jeffrey S. Skoll Chair in Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
A trade in Bitcoin futures, in other words, could somewhat smooth out the roller-coaster ride that comes with holding any Bitcoins, the price of which often rises and falls by double-digit percentages in the span of 24 hours.
READ MORE: Tempted to invest in Bitcoin? Here are a few things to consider
On Monday, financial markets seemed to think the cryptocurrency would rise further but at a significantly slower pace than it has in recent weeks.
Just over 15 hours after trading began, the Bitcoin future contract that settles in January was trading at $17,910, or 10 per cent above bitcoin‘s “spot” price – the price at which it is currently changing hands – which was $16,450, according to Reuters.
This suggests investors believe the digital currency will appreciate by only 10 per cent over the course of a month, a fraction of the over 300 per cent climb it registered over the past four weeks or so.
Bitcoin is up more than 1,500 per cent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.
READ MORE: Bitcoin for Canadians: Where to buy it – and the taxes you'll pay
But any dampening of Bitcoin's volatility is likely going to be limited, Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business told Global News.
That's because there's a massive disagreement among investors about what the value of Bitcoin should be, now or in the future. Some investors believe the currency is worth zero, others have been predicting it will reach $1 million.
That spread is far wider than the disagreements investors have about the value of a stock or currency and is the main reason for Bitcoin's wild ups and downs, according to Harvey.
Futures may make it easier to bet on Bitcoin and to bet against it, but they do nothing about the issue that there are no commonly accepted metrics to determine the digital currency's value, according to Harvey.

You might soon see Bitcoin ETFs
The thing futures trading on a big financial exchange almost certainly does for Bitcoin is lent it legitimacy.
“[Bitcoin futures] will speed up the march towards legitimization of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London told Reuters.
Further to that, Bitcoin futures might open the door to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), said Harvey.

An ETF is a security that tracks the price of a stock index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets.
Regulators have shot down various attempts to introduce ETFs that track the price of Bitcoin in the U.S. out of concern that Bitcoin prices on unregulated digital currency exchanges could be manipulated, said Harvey. But that concern doesn't exist for Bitcoin futures trading on a major exchange that's fully regulated.
The trouble with that is that while Bitcoin ETFs would likely be volatile and risky like virtual currency itself, they might attract even more retail investors to it, said Harvey.
And while many small-time Bitcoin buyers might have made only very small purchases, Bitcoin ETFs could invite larger investments by inexperienced investors.
Americans can't put a Bitcoin account in their 401k retirement plan, but they could put a Bitcoin ETF into it, noted Harvey.
WATCH: Bitcoin: hot investment opportunity or looming bubble?
Other major exchanges to follow suit on Bitcoin futures
Soon, professional investors hoping to buy Bitcoin futures will have several options.
Chicago's other major exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), is expected to launch its own futures contract on Dec. 17.
And Nasdaq is planning to introduce Bitcoin futures sometime next year.
But while Bitcoin's ride into the financial mainstream seems to be gaining steam, there are still a number of tricky questions facing investors and regulators.
For one, there's the fact that different Bitcoin exchanges report different prices for the virtual currency. That's why the CME futures will be based on the prices of at least four different Bitcoin exchanges, said Harvey.
Those traded on the CBOE, on the other hand, are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
READ MORE: Winklevoss twins are now Bitcoin billionaires. What that means for the rest of us
But a thornier issue is how futures exchanges would handle what digital currency geeks call “a fork,” in which Bitcoin has spun off different versions of itself. This has happened several times in the past, with the birth of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, for example, which have acquired considerable momentum in their own right.
“How would Bitcoin futures handle another fork?” asked Harvey.
That question doesn't seem to have an answer yet.

The royal wedding may be over, but there's still a lot of planning to be done before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex finally settle in to their new roles. Their official residence is in need of some sprucing up, so Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are leasing a home on the Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds for the next two years, according to Us Weekly. The pair had previously been living at Nottingham Cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace, but now that they've made things official, the property is being renovated to suit the new Duchess' taste.
A source told Us that Queen Elizabeth will "most likely give them a house as a wedding present as they did with William and Kate … but whichever one they get will need an update." Of course, royals can't live in an active construction zone like the rest of us normal people, so in the meantime, they'll be staying at a cottage 90 minutes outside of London, called WestfieldLarge, where they also spent the weekend before their wedding. The property is on the same grounds as David and Victoria Beckham's country home, in a charming centuries-old village that's recently turned into a bustling summer destination.
The 4,000-acre Great Tew estate in Cotswold Hills, Oxfordshire traces its roots all the way back to the year 990, when it was owned by Aelfric, Abbot of St. Albans, a former Archbishop of Canterbury. It was privately owned until 1914, when it became part of the public trust and eventually fell into disrepair. It was inherited by Major Eustace Robb in 1962, according to Historic England, who began restoring the early 17th Century manor home and surrounding cottages. After their death in 1985, the property was left to the family of multimillionaire Nick Johnston, who continued to restore the buildings, as well as adding modern improvements. The estate now boasts several short- and long-term rental properties, according to the official website, "ranging from one-bed cottages to large detached farmhouses."
Johnston, a friend of former Prime Minister David Cameron, has recently proposed building a "world-class car museum" and 28 more rental homes on the property in order to raise the £12.7 million needed to restore the original manor, which is currently uninhabitable, according to the Daily Mail. The estate grounds are also home to the Cornbury Music Festival, an eclectic annual summer event that describes itself as such:
A homespun melting pot where music-lovers share pies and a glass of champagne with superstars, toffs, rockers, crooners, Morris dancers, farmers, urbanites, fashionistas, gourmet chefs and little old ladies who make exceptional cakes.
Sounds like the Duke and Duchess are about to get some very noisy neighbors come July.
The area is also home to the Soho Farmhouse, a members-only resort where Markle had their bridal shower in March, according to E! Online. The club features cottages and hotel rooms, several restaurants, horseback riding, a cooking school, and an indoor-outdoor pool. The club holds a special connection to the Duke and Duchess, as they were introduced by club director Markus Anderson, a close friend of Markle, and the two had their first date at the London branch, according to The Cut.
After their two-year stay at the countryside hot spot, the royal couple will go back to Nottingham Cottage, a two-bedroom property that's been Harry's "bachelor pad" (complete with a hammock in the garden) since 2013. The home was previously occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who vacated it when Prince George was a few months old in favor of a 20-room apartment inside the palace proper, according to the Mirror. After the hustle and bustle of Great Tew, the cozy cottage will really seem like home.
Spencer Prewett outta Oak Bay, is the drummer and founder of the death metal band, Archspire.
Prewett was standing in a Subway lineup when they got a Facebook message from their guitar player that read, “Holy cow, we've been nominated for a Juno.” Prewett says they were completely shocked considering the genre of music it is. “We play really extreme music, so to get any kind of recognition from anything mainstream is pretty bizarre…but a nice surprise,” they added.
The band has been nominated for metal/hard music album of the year at the 2018 Juno awards.
Prewett, “I don't think anybody plays this genre for money or for mainstream recognition. The people who play it, play it because they love it.”
Archspire has released three albums since 2009, with their third album, Relentless Mutation, receiving the nomination. The band is currently in Vancouver and will kick off its tour following the Junos. It'll start in Japan before heading to the U.S.

Rochelle Municipal Airport-Koritz Field (KRPJ) has become the first general aviation airport in Illinois to sell Swift Fuel's unleaded UL94 aviation gasoline for its piston aircraft customers.
“With a solid portion of the traffic at the airport being piston-engine aircraft, we were not only seeking a cleaner, more environmentally-friendly alternative to 100LL, we also needed a more resilient option than recreational autogas,” said Michael Hudetz, airport manager. “With Swift Fuels' UL94 being commercially available nationwide, we recognized that we had an opportunity to offer our pilots the best unleaded option in the market today.”
Hudetz listed the benefits of the unleaded avgas, including: “UL94 eliminates lead-fouled sparkplugs, allows longer oil change maintenance intervals than 100LL, and UL94 avgas has a 10-15 times longer shelf life than autogas.”
“Also, since it has a low RVP year-round, we no longer must concern ourselves with seasonal vapor pressure fluctuations that can cause vapor lock in aircraft, so our pilots will love flying it year-round and come back for more,” they continued. “We're extremely proud to be the first airport in Illinois to join the progressive nationwide movement toward unleaded avgas.”
“We continue to work with regulators, aircraft and engine OEMs, pilots, airports, municipalities, airport boards and supply chain folks as a part of a multi-year initiative to educate the market on the key benefits of unleaded avgas,” said Swift Fuels CEO Chris D'Acosta. “The industry leaders like Mike Hudetz at Rochelle recognize the growing demand for cleaner fuel for their customers, and such forward-thinkers continue to play an integral role in the transition. We recognized early on that pilots would value the longer maintenance intervals, less wear-and-tear on engines, less corrosion, longer sparkplug life, etc. We are extremely proud to have our UL94 avgas available for piston aircraft use at Rochelle.”
Swift Fuel's unleaded UL94 Avgas is sold nationwide. More than 100,000 aircraft are already FAA authorized to use the UL94 avgas as a “drop-in ready” fuel.
Company officials noted that UL94 is not a full replacement for 100LL, so only those aircraft with engine and airframes requiring 94 motor-octane fuels or lower are compatible, which represents 65% of the U.S. piston fleet.

For six days, the three “cowardly” thugs who were caught on video beating a helpless autistic man at Square One have been at large and unidentified.
But the Toronto Sun has learned there's a break in the case that could change all of that.
Peel Regional Police are all over this investigation and I'm told it may be somebody from British Columbia who could help make the difference here.
More than 300,000 people have viewed the shocking surveillance video of a gutless, sucker-punch attack by three men on the innocent 29-year-old who was putting on their in-line skates at the Mississauga mall's bus station around 10:45 p.m. on March 13.
But even with all of those eyeballs on the repugnant crime, there were not as many solid leads as expected.
And now Peel police know why. Turns out investigators now believe the thugs are not from here.
“Very good progress has been made and investigators now have credible information that the persons responsible are originally from British Columbia — specifically the lower mainland area,” said Peel Insp. Norm English, who added they believe the trio “recently travelled to the GTA.”
The first tip from the widely watched video was from out West, and police are asking people in British Columbia to take a look at the disturbing recording.
“I would ask that this investigation and (video link) be circulated on the West Coast,” English said Monday. “We have already had 300,000 views on this video, but now that we have a belief these men were from British Columbia, we are asking media and people who live out there to take a closer look.”
English is specifically talking about Vancouver and the region that surrounds it, including places like Surrey, Abbotsford and Richmond.
“This cowardly act on a defenceless 29-year-old autistic male was captured on video and has received a considerable amount of media and social media attention, and I want to thank the public for their tremendous response,” English added.
“People have family and friends, associates and maybe they will recognize who these people are. There's somebody out there who knows these guys.”
The victim is “still very shaken up” and “going through a lot,” said English. “We are here for them and their family and that will continue.”
The first wanted man is described as South Asian with a light complexion, and 5-foot-10 with a thin build. They have a dark short beard and straight black hair above the ears. They were wearing a black T-shirt with a red Air Jordan logo and white Jordan lettering, with black track pants and black shoes.
The second man is also South Asian with a light complexion, 5-foot-10, a thin build, and clean shaven. They were wearing a black jacket with a grey horizontal stripe across the chest and a grey vertical stripe along the hood, black track pants and black shoes.
The third man is South Asian with a medium complexion, 5-foot-10, a medium build, and unshaven. They were wearing a black hoodie with a Nike logo on the front and white Nike lettering along the sleeves, black track pants and black shoes.
Anyone with information is asked to call Peel police at 905-453-3311, ext. 1233, their local police department or Crime Stoppers.

Cloudera, the enterprise big data company that's received significant backing from Intel, has released the expected price range for its IPO. The company says it plans to price its shares between $12 and $14. The price will get finalized the night before Cloudera debuts on the stock market, which is expected to happen later this month.
The proposed price is a significant disappointment for some of the investors and employees of the company because it will mean it has gone down in value since its last private round. If it prices at the top of the range, Cloudera will be valued at $1.8 billion, significantly less than the $4.1 billion valuation from its 2014 round. This scenario has become known as a “down round IPO.”
The company has raised at least $1 billion, dating back to 2008. Intel is the largest shareholder, owning 22 percent of the company, prior to the IPO. Accel owns 16.3 percent and Greylock Partners owns 12.5 percent.
The company's filing, which was unveiled last month, gave us a glimpse at their financials. Revenue is growing, totaling $261 million for the fiscal year ending in January. Cloudera brought in $166 million for the same period last year.
Losses were $186.32 million, down from $203 million in the same timeframe the year before. The risk factors section of the filing says they “expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.”
Competition could be one of the biggest obstacles for Cloudera. HP, IBM, Oracle, Amazon Web Services and Hortonworks are amongst the competitors listed in the S-1 documents.
Intel and Cloudera have been working on partnerships that aim to improve the speed and also the security for data processing. According to the filing, “Intel and Cloudera collaborated on optimized data encryption speed through use of arithmetic acceleration built into the Intel Architecture. Intel and Cloudera also collaborated to develop Spot (incubating project), an open source cybersecurity analytics platform built on open data models that provides advanced threat detection using big data analytics and machine learning.”
Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Allen & Co are the underwriting banks on the offering. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker “CLDR.”
Last month, Snap kicked off 2017 tech IPOs after a slow last year. Since then we've seen MuleSoft, Alteryx, Yext, Okta and Netshoes debut.

Sonchiriya first look poster: Sushant Singh Rajput, Manoj Bajpayee play gun-wielding Chambal dacoits
The first look poster of Abhishek Chaubey's Sonchiriya has been released and it's all guns and glory. Starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ashutosh Rana and Ranvir Shorey, the film revolves around the dacoits of Chambal and is set in the 1970s. Directed by Abhishek Chaubey, who has been at the helm of films like Udta Punjab, Dedh Ishqiya and Ishqiya, Sonchiriya has locked an 8 February, 2019 release date.

The first look shows a gang of armed men ready to take on whoever comes in their way. Set against the dry terrains of Chambal, the poster may remind some of the critically acclaimed 1994 film Bandit Queen.
Presented by Ronnie Screwvala's RSVP movies, the film also marks the first collaboration between Rajput and Pednekar. In the film, Rajput will be seen in the role of a dreaded dacoit who roams the Chambal ravines with their pack.
The last time that a notable Bollywood film on the life of dacoits came out was Irrfan Khan's 2012 movie, Paan Singh Tomar.

Pyeongchang lies in mountainous terrain at the uppermost eastern corner of South Korea, about an hour from the border with North Korea. Normally, its proximity to the demilitarized zone, and the North beyond, would not be an issue.
But six months from now, thousands of athletes from around the world are set to gather at that remote location for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Given the escalated tensions in the region — with President Trump threatening “fire and fury” and North Korea responding with plans to send a volley of missiles toward the U.S. territory of Guam — Pyeongchang's location has become a global concern.
“You've got to know that [Olympic officials] are nervous,” said Mark Dyreson, a sports historian at Penn State. “They're in a tough situation.”
Though the International Olympic Committee has resisted any knee-jerk reaction to the battle of words between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un, it is clearly listening.
Much can change, either good or bad, as the clock ticks down to the opening ceremony on Feb. 9. An IOC spokesperson said: “We are monitoring the situation on the Korean peninsula very closely.”
This isn't the first time the Olympic movement has butted up against politics or possible violence. No matter how often IOC leaders talk about “the autonomy of sport,” the real world keeps intruding.
“The Games have always been politicized,” said Michael Heine, director of the International Center for Olympic Studies in Canada. “From Mexico City to Beijing to Berlin, there are plenty of examples.”
The 1916 Summer Olympics — scheduled for Berlin — were scratched when World War I engulfed Europe. World War II similarly forced the cancellation of the Summer and Winter Games in 1940 and 1944.
In other instances, the competition has been shadowed by regional wars, economic depression, boycotts, disease and terrorism.
Palestinian terrorists raided the athletes village during the 1972 Munich Olympics, a siege that led to the deaths of 11 Israeli team members. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, a bomb exploded in a downtown park, killing two and injuring dozens more.
A Chechen rebel leader urged Islamist militants to “do their utmost to derail” the 2014 Sochi Olympics in Russia. Before the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, the Zika virus outbreak was declared a global health emergency.
In each of these cases, the Games proceeded on schedule.
Still, experts wonder if the Korean crisis might be different. Heine asked: “Will there be a tipping point? Could the Games be moved or postponed at this late date?”
When Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games, there was concern that North Korea might open a dam on its side of the border, sending floodwaters toward the southern capital city.
This time, the seeming unpredictability of Trump and Kim is most worrisome to Heine. They said they suspect that some countries — especially those where winter sports are that popular — might reconsider sending teams.
As a University of California professor who studies international politics, Steven Weber does not believe that athletes will be at risk in Pyeongchang, but they said the Winter Games “will give the North Koreans an opportunity to make a different kind of noise.”
“The thing they like to do is demonstrate their ability to disrupt other people's plans,” Weber said. “It gives them a leverage they wouldn't otherwise have.”
The communist state has demonstrated a growing expertise in cyberattacks that might allow it to cause havoc, if only momentarily, during the 17 days of competition.
“They might have the capability to turn the lights out for an hour … not to hurt anybody but to show they can keep this thing from coming off smoothly,” Weber said.
China could be in position to prevent such trouble.
Not only are the Chinese a major trade partner with North Korea, they also have a vested interest in the Olympic movement, given that they are scheduled to host the Winter Games in 2022.
Anything that tarnishes the IOC's brand would damage their plans to make a splash five years from now.
“They want to be seen as an important Olympic player,” Heine said. “So the onus falls on the Chinese government.”
This influence could lead to a diplomatic solution as it relates to the Games.
Talks of forming a North-South hockey team and holding ski events north of the border have fallen through, but there could be time for other forms of diplomacy between neighbors still technically at war — their 1950s conflict ended by a ceasefire and the creation of the 160-mile demilitarized zone.
“Sports are one of the few things that could be offered to North Korea as a face-saver for backing down a little bit,” Weber said.
For now, Pyeongchang 2018 organizers say they are working with the South Korean government while continuing to prepare for next February.
It is probably too late to move the Games to another country. Short of armed conflict in the region, postponement seems just as unlikely.
“The IOC has very few options,” Heine said. “I think they will persevere.”

A U.S. sailor has been arrested on allegations of stealing grenades from a San Diego-based Navy ship.
Federal prosecutors say Gunner's Mate Second Class Aaron Booker was detained Tuesday in Great Lakes, Illinois.
 They are accused of possessing 20 concussion hand grenades reported missing from the USS Pinckney guided missile destroyer.
Booker could not be reached for comment. It was not clear if they had a lawyer.
Court documents say the grenades were discovered missing Feb. 8, 2017.
Booker was tasked with checking the temperature of the ship's locker where the grenades were kept.
They were later sent for duties in Illinois.
In April, an off-duty law enforcement officer in Arizona found a military-issued backpack on the side of a highway with "GM2 BOOKER" written on it containing 18 grenades.
× Expand The Edwardsville cheerleading team includes (front row, left to right) Morgan Goebel, Maddie McDaniel, Jasmyn Kloster, Jordan Bielicke, Taylor Marrs, Emma Moore; (second row) Rachel Mullican, Kaitlyn Kent, Hannah Stubits, Taegan Riley, Emily Voss, Lindsey Dial, Paige Way; (third row) Abby Davey, Morgan Allen, Micah Summers, Grace Hauch, Kylea Dietz, Tara Colligan; (fourth row) Alyx Smith, Abbie Carpenter, Drea Hoedebeck, Mia Dalla Riva, Sydney Weber, Cyrina Beckmann.
EDWARDSVILLE — The Edwardsville cheerleading team had mixed emotions at the Illinois High School Association state final competition Feb. 3-4 at U.S. Cellular Coliseum in Bloomington.
The Tigers were upset they didn't walk out of Bloomington with a state title, but they were happy they got to compete in the second day of competition.
“Our school hasn't been to day two in seven years, so to be called to go to day two, there were tears of joy,” second-year Edwardsville coach Shanna Combes said.
The top 10 teams in the preliminaries of state competition qualify for the second day. Edwardsville placed ninth with an 82.80 to advance to finals.
“We as coaches give as much encouragement and positivity as we can,” Combes said. “When they called us, I don't think there was a dry eye from Edwardsville in the coliseum. They were so in shock because every year, they were so close and they never got it.”
The Tigers finished ninth in the finals with an 81.91. They were the only Southern Illinois team that made it to the finals.
Lincoln-Way East, Joliet West, Sandburg, Providence Catholic, Neuqua Valley, Lockport, Lake Zurich and St. Charles East made up the top eight at state.
A year ago, Edwardsville came up three places short of a trip to finals. The Tigers finished 13th in preliminaries.
Combes said qualifying for finals was pretty special for seniors Taylor Marrs, Maddie McDaniel, Emma Moore, Jasmyn Kloster, Morgan Goebel and Jordan Bielecke.
“It got them all choked up because they got one more time together to do it,” the Edwardsville coach said.
The Tigers have a total of 25 cheerleaders. Rounding out the team are Rachel Mullican, Kaitlyn Kent, Hannah Stubits, Taegan Riley, Emily Voss, Lindsey Dial, Paige Way, Abby Davey, Morgan Allen, Micah Summers, Grace Hauch, Kylea Dietz, Tara Colligan, Alyx Smith, Abbie Carpenter, Drea Hoedebeck, Mia Dalla Riva, Sydney Weber and Cyrina Beckman.
Combes said their cheerleaders display a strong work ethic in competitions and practices.
“They immediately have the drive to be better to make sure what they're doing is pretty much perfect,” they said.
Edwardsville made its fourth straight trip to state and its ninth overall. The Tigers qualified for state by placing third out of 14 teams at the Mahomet-Seymour Sectional on Jan. 28.
The ninth-place finish at state was part of a strong season for the Tigers. Last month, Edwardsville won the Illinois Cheerleaders Coaches Association state competition in Springfield, placing first in the large-school division.
“These girls have worked throughout the entire year,” Combes said. “We first competed in our area. We went to Highland, then we competed at our own competition in Edwardsville. They've done very well in all of the competitions. Our biggest competition was when we headed up north and competed at Bradley-Bourbonnais and took second to some northern school and then the next day, we went to Lincoln-Way East and we took fifth. Our goal was to hit the top five up there, and we did.”
Combes took over the Edwardsville program in 2015. They worked as a cheerleading coach at Civic Memorial for nine years.
Combes, a teacher at Liberty Middle School, said the Tigers will aim for a higher finish at state next year.
“Now that the girls know they can make it to day two, their goal next year is shot for the top five and inch our way to that podium,” they said.

PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) Vincent Edward had 18 points, seven rebounds and eight assists, and No. 3 Purdue held on to beat Rutgers 78-76 on Saturday for a school-record 19th straight win.
Mathis Dakota scored 16 points, Carsen Edwards had 13 and P.J. Thompson added 12 points for the Boilermakers (23-2, 12-0 Big Ten).
Corey Sanders had 31 points and seven rebounds, and Deshawn Freeman added 14 points and nine rebounds for Rutgers (12-13, 2-10), which overcame a 15-point first-half deficit looked poised to pull off an upset at home.
Freeman's fastbreak dunk cut Purdue's lead to six, forcing Boilermakers coach Matt Painter to call a timeout with 15:29 to go. However, Matt Bullock corralled a defensive rebound on the ensuing possession and hit Sanders with an outlet pass and they made the fastbreak layup and the foul shot to pull the Scarlet Knights to 46-43.
Rutgers pulled within one on two occasions. Shaquile Doorson had a put-back dunk off of Geo Baker's missed layup to get to 48-47 with 12:28 left, and Freeman had a tip-in on a miss by Sanders to make it 55-54 with 8:06 remaining, However, that was as close as the Scarlet Knights got the rest of the way.
Rutgers took a 3-0 lead on a Issa Thiam 3-pointer. Purdue tied it 29 seconds later after Thiam fouled P.J. Thompson on a 3-pointer. Carsen Edwards stole the ball and hit a layup on Rutgers' ensuing possession to give the Boilermakers their first lead. They led 38-27 at halftime.
BIG PICTURE
Purdue: The Boilermakers' winning streak is the longest in the nation and has them atop the conference standings. They'll look to improve their home winning streak to 22 – the third-longest in school history – when they host No. 17 Ohio State. A win would give them a bit of a cushion in what has become a three-team race for the Big Ten title between Purdue, Ohio State and No. 5 Michigan State.
Rutgers: Bruised and battered, Rutgers continues to struggle. With senior captain Mike Williams (ankle) out for the past two weeks and Eugene Omoruyi out for several weeks to recover from a knee injury suffered at Illinois, the undermanned Scarlet Knights fell to below .500 for the first time all season and have now lost five-straight, sitting alone at the bottom of the Big Ten.
UP NEXT
Purdue: The Boilermakers return home to host No. 17 Ohio State on Wednesday night.
Rutgers: The Scarlet Knights host Indiana on Tuesday night.
There's a new factor driving Los Angeles start-up investment: Snapchat-induced fear of missing out.
That's according to Chris Hameetman, president of Tech Coast Angels Los Angeles — the region's leading angel investor organization. They say concern about missing the boat on Los Angeles' next big thing is the most noticeable local trend during the first quarter.
Investment in Los Angeles and Orange County start-ups held steady compared with recent quarters, according to several reports from market research companies. But they show an increasing portion of the investment nationwide is going to well-established start-ups compared with newer ones. Expect the gap to narrow, at least in Los Angeles, in 2017 as investors pay more attention to the the newest companies, Hameetman says.
Their recent investments include bar-tending robot Somabar (for which he's a co-founder), delivery service Schlep & Fetch and inhaled antibiotics maker Savara Pharmaceuticals. Angels such as Hameetman usually are wealthy individuals who make the first bets on start-ups, often when they're nothing more than two people and an idea.
What caught your eye in the first quarter?
One of the more interesting things happening is the Los Angeles ecosystem itself rather than any one company.
In 2016, the venture capital world was all about going further downstream to allow companies to mature more, get more traction, really prove themselves more before investing. The larger venture capitalists moved further from [riskier] angel investments because there was ample investment available from others.
Now flash-forward with Snap's IPO [last month] and the realization that Los Angeles venture capitalists were missing out. Snap's biggest investors were not from Los Angeles.
Snapchat: From an idea at Stanford to Southern California's biggest-ever IPO »
In 2017, this is the year of local venture capitalists putting their tendrils out. There's a lot of egg on people's faces for missing out on Snap. There's a lot more emphasis on seeing every possible deal you can in Los Angeles. We're seeing a lot more cross-pollination, a lot more established venture capitalists coming to us with inbound inquires.
We've opened a venture affiliate membership for venture capital firms and larger [family-fortune investment groups] to help them see as much as they can possibly see. Trying to keep an eye on every part of the city and every node is becoming more challenging. Therefore, all the funding sources have to work together to share information. It's a very interesting post-Snap world.
Why was there ample angel investment available? Why did that allow venture capitalists to pull back the last few years?
It is stunning how many times I heard of a new investment, and I'd never heard of the investor before. There's an inordinate number of micro-funds, new accelerators, family [investment groups]. There are so many capital sources and people investing in very, very early-stage companies that venture capitalists have had the opportunity to step back a bit, even if they are seed funds, so they could cherry-pick those that are showing traction and innovation.
And Snap really flipped the switch?
It's brought eyes back to early-stage companies. But I don't know how this is all going to play out because we have these two competing forces: Half your brain is saying, “Wait, wait, wait [to consider investing].” And half is saying, “You don't want to not see something.”
Where are you seeing VCs getting involved?
Normally, you wouldn't see venture capital companies investing in the same rounds as angels. I have absolutely seen that this year. I can demonstrate that in [brain health technology start-up] Neural Analytics, which just closed a $10-million Series A fundraising round last week. We had both angel, family office and venture capital money. We have Coin-In, an online casino game maker, and that was local angels and VC investor money, with Wavemaker Partners.
What other trends are you seeing?
I am surprised I haven't seen many artificial intelligence deals. AI has been so hot in the tech industry that I'm surprised in Los Angeles I don't think I've seen any new [start-ups focused on artificial intelligence technology] in a big way.
I haven't seen a ton of augmented reality technology either, but I've seen a ton of virtual reality content creators.
Local universities have ramped up their entrepreneurship programs. Any results from that for you yet?
Absolutely. Neural Analytics was born out of the UCLA Anderson School and the hospital. It's built on licensed UCLA technology.
[But this school year,] nothing has blown us away from the universities.
There's continued maturity of the university programs, but candidly, the real investable companies have been coming from the graduate schools rather than from the undergraduates. They have a better sense of the pain points, solutions and the addressable market.
Coming out of undergraduate, it's a little harder to get your arms around issues that require a bit of entrepreneurial maturity. People with real world experience give a bit more comfort.
Do you foresee any additional Snap-like catalysts for changes then this year?
There absolutely is a markedly improved IPO environment. But I don't see anything directly on my radar that will be a sea change.
At this point, there should be no reason a company can't be born, matured and go public in Los Angeles. There should be no pushback.
Rumor the German shepherd wins best in show at Westminster
NEW YORK (AP) Quite a rally for Rumor – a commanding comeback for German shepherds, too.
Rumor was crowned America's top dog Tuesday night when, a year after a near miss, they came out of retirement to win best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club.
Cheered loudly all around the ring by a packed crowd at Madison Square Garden, and clearly the crowd favorite, she's just the second German shepherd to win the event that began in 1877.
“Unbelievable,” handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said.
In a year that's seen lots of late, startling twists in sports – think Patriots, Cubs and Cavaliers – Rumor pulled a shocker. She'd been at home in Wisconsin for months, a house pet headed toward having puppies, when they suddenly jumped back into the show ring in January.
Boyles is a fan of the Green Bay Packers and star quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Seeing a pet go from the couch to this top prize, heck, that's a dog world Hail Mary.
Rumor beat out a Norwegian elkhound, a Pekingese, a miniature poodle, an Irish setter, a boxer and a Norwich terrier in the final ring. The Irish setter called Adrian finished second.
“The German shepherd standard talks about quality and nobility,” judge Thomas Bradley III said. “When you recognize it, it hits you at home, and that's what it really is.  They are just magnificent.”
The 5-year-old Rumor is named for the Adele hit song “Rumor Has It.” This was the 104th career win for Rumor, and earlier in the day, Boyles said that this would definitely, for real, be their last major show.
“She's going to be relaxing for a while,” Boyles said after the win, but ultimately, there are “puppies in their future.”
Rumor joined the fittingly named Manhattan in 1987 as the only German shepherds to go best in show at the Garden.
There were nearly 2,800 dogs entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition, spread across the 202 eligible breeds and varieties.

Officials with the state Department of Energy And Environmental Protection are considering adding more signs or strengthening the language of these signs to warn about dangers at Silver Sands in Milford. (Published 5 hours ago)
The signs warning of danger at the Silver Sands State Park sandbar could change.
Officials with the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection are considering making changes after a meeting with Milford representatives last week.
The sandbar that connects the beach at Silver Sands to Charles Island gets covered with water during high tide and a 28-year-old man drowned last month after a strong current swept them off the sandbar.
Changes DEEP officials are considering include strengthening the language to warn of danger, adding more signs and posting signs in multiple languages.
Local representatives, including State Rep. Kim Rose, have also been pushing for more lifeguards.
Lifeguards are only at Silver Sands State Park from Thursday through Sunday. DEEP officials said they have a tough time recruiting qualified candidates and would need more funding from the state to provide lifeguards seven days a week.
DEEP officials said there's no timetable on when a decision will be made, however they do not expect to implement any changes until next year.
Jesmyn Ward's latest novel, “Sing, Unburied, Sing,” is a multivocal book, switching voices from chapter to chapter. But its moral anchor is a young boy named JoJo, a biracial child in Mississippi who is essentially without parents and who, at the age of 13, will still begin their monologue by gravely observing, “I like to think I know what death is. I like to think it is something I could look at straight.”
JoJo is, in other words, that cliché, an old soul. But as is somewhat unusual for novels about preternaturally observant children, Ward explicitly spells out for us why they are this way. JoJo's mother, Leonie, had them young, and to a degree not often portrayed in fiction they are ambivalent, even hostile to, motherhood. They live with their own parents and largely lets them parent their children. Them focal point instead is JoJo's father, Michael, who is incarcerated upstate for drug-related crimes. They have been gone three years when the novel opens, but is about to be released. Absence has not diminished Leonie's consuming passion for him. They still feel that Michael sees past them “skin the color of unmilked coffee, eyes black, lips the color of plums, and saw me. Saw the walking wound I was, and came to be my balm.”
They maintain a tricky balance: their story is moral-but-not-judgmental, political-but-not-polemical, sad-but-not-treacly.
Most of the book takes place during the car ride in which Leonie, JoJo, JoJo's younger sister Michaela, and a friend drive north to fetch Michael from prison, and go back home again. Everyone is lost in daydreams, as people often are in cars, which helps expand from this potentially claustrophobic setting. But Michaela is sick, constantly vomiting, and JoJo must spend most of the trip acting as surrogate parent. They do not trust Leonie, not in the least, to care either for them or their sister. “She ain't never healed anything or grown nothing in their life, and they don't know,” they say of their mother. Instead JoJo must reckon mostly alone with a world that is indifferent or hostile to them and one, too, that is seeded with ghosts of people they themselves never met when alive.
They maintain a tricky balance: their story is moral-but-not-judgmental, political-but-not-polemical, sad-but-not-treacly.
To describe the elements of the book is to somehow make them sound like reductive clichés when they are not. For example, one of those ghosts claims to be a boy named Richie, who in life was incarcerated with JoJo's grandfather, River, at the same prison that Michael ended up in. Richie, we figure out early on, has died in some horrible unspoken way. We also know that the death is tied up with River somehow, even as River recounts to JoJo a protective relationship toward the boy: “I remembered again how young they are, how their big teeth was still breaking through their gums in some places.”
There is something about their depiction of the working class...that seems lived-in, in a way that feels desperately needed in the cohort of Big American Books.
There are writerly hands in which such a device, with all its clear invocations of the South's racial history, might rapidly prove blunt and insufferable. But not in Ward's, a 2011 winner of the National Book Award.  They are as economical a writer, in their own way, as Hemingway, using only the necessary number of words. If anything, there are times the reader wants Ward to elaborate more, not less. There is something about their depiction of the working class, in particular, that seems lived-in, in a way that feels desperately needed in the cohort of Big American Books. A plot point here, for example, turns on the cost of the gas it takes to drive to the prison, a question that many novelists would not even bother to ask setting up a similar situation.
The climax of this book takes us to an encounter with the police that, after several years of headlines about police brutality, feels unnervingly familiar. Again, it would be easy for a lesser writer to make this a self-important set piece, dead as any flogged horse could be. Ward cracks the situation open like a mirror as their characters are pulled out of the car and all of them, even the child JoJo, are cuffed. A gun is pointed at him, one that they can't ever again forget: “It is a tingle at the back of my skull, an itching at my shoulder.”
Of course there isn't anything to be found in the car, per se, though Leonie is indeed hiding something from the police. But it is the sheer terror of the characters, the untenability of their situation, that really matters, not the facts at hand. And Ward is a master at evoking it. With first “Salvage the Bones” and now “Sing, Unburied, Sing,” they have proved themselves to be an excellent writer of brief but socially and intellectually ambitious novels. One only wants to ask them to push further, and write even more.
Dean is the 2017 recipient of the Nona Balakian citation for excellence in book reviewing. Them book, “Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,” will be published in April 2018.

Best overall OnePlus 5 See at OnePlus The OnePlus 5 continues the company's tradition of delivering a flagship-class experience for a couple of hundred dollars less than the competition. The highlight of this year's phone is dual cameras at the back, with a Portrait Mode allowing you to take portraits with a background blur effect. The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 835, and while the overall design may not be as groundbreaking as the Galaxy S8, OnePlus has once again managed to get all the basics right. You can pick up the OnePlus 5 with either 6GB of RAM and 64GB storage for $479, or get the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage for $539. Bottom line: The OnePlus 5 is a solid choice if you're looking for a phone with top-notch internals, clean software, and all-day battery life. One more thing: You can now pick up the OnePlus 5 in a Soft Gold color option.
Why the OnePlus 5 is the best
OnePlus refined its formula for the affordable flagship with the OnePlus 5, offering a phone that delivers top-notch hardware and clean software at a price that's $200 to $300 lower than the competition.
The highlight with the OnePlus 5 is the dual camera setup at the back. The primary 16MP camera is augmented by a secondary 20MP shooter that acts as a telephoto lens — giving you 2x lossless zoom. Then there's Dash Charge, which is one of the best fast charging standards available today. With Dash Charge, you can get up to a 60% charge after plugging your phone in for just 30 minutes.
The screen size (and resolution) are unchanged from last year, with the phone featuring a 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED panel. The internals have received a significant bump, however, in the form of the 2.45GHz Snapdragon 835. When it comes to the software side of things, OxygenOS delivers one of the best experiences currently available on Android. The user interface is similar to pure Android, but there are several customization options available to make the phone truly yours.
This time around, OnePlus is offering a single global SKU of the OnePlus 5. That means that the same model will be sold around the world, with no variances across regions. The move allows for easier roaming, as the device has 34 LTE bands for global usage.
OnePlus sells a single version of the OnePlus 5 globally, and that's a big deal.
Selling a single SKU also means that all models of the OnePlus 5 sport a dual-SIM card tray, with both slots offering LTE connectivity. That's a big deal.
If you're rocking Bluetooth headphones, you'll be glad to know that the OnePlus 5 has both the aptX and aptX HD audio codecs — which deliver vastly improved sound quality over Bluetooth. The phone also has Bluetooth 5, but it'll be a while before you can take advantage of the standard.
There are a few drawbacks with the device — there's no waterproofing, and you won't be able to use the phone on Verizon or Sprint. That said, it
Best alternative LG G6 (H870DS) See at Amazon A brand-new unlocked LG G6 will set you back $649, but the variant up for sale in the U.S. misses out on a few key features. The internal storage is limited to 32GB, and the U.S. model doesn't have LG's latest DAC. If you want 64GB storage, 32-bit Quad DAC, and a dual-SIM slot, your best bet is to pick up the Asian variant (model number H870DS). Aside from the higher storage, better audio capabilities and two SIM card slots, the LG G6 H870DS is identical to the version sold in the U.S. You're getting a 5.7-inch QHD panel with a resolution of 2880 x 1440, Snapdragon 821, 4GB of RAM, 64GB storage, microSD slot, dual 13MP cameras, and a 3300mAh battery. The chassis is IP68 certified, and is compliant with the MIL-STD-810G standard. The main downside with the H870DS variant is that there's no warranty, and you miss out on wireless charging, which is limited to the U.S. model. That said, you can pick up the H870DS for $499 from Amazon. Bottom line: For $499, the LG G6 H870DS is a very compelling device if you're willing to forgo wireless charging. One more thing: The Asian variant has LTE bands for GSM carriers in the U.S., so you won't be able to use the phone on Verizon or Sprint.
Best phablet Huawei Mate 9 See at Amazon A large screen, big battery, high-end internals, and Leica optics — the $479 Mate 9 has it all. The 5.9-inch Full HD screen makes it ideal for viewing multimedia on the go, and the dual rear cameras — a 12MP RGB sensor alongside a 20MP monochrome lens — combined with the Leica tuning gives the Mate 9 an edge in this segment. The Mate 9 also offers global LTE bands, and the phone is compatible with over 1334 carriers in 217 countries. As it is a GSM device, it is limited to T-Mobile and AT&T in the U.S. Bottom line: The Mate 9 is an all-rounder that delivers amazing value for money. One more thing: The Mate 9 is the first phone to feature Amazon's voice-based assistant, Alexa.
Best budget option Honor 6X See at Amazon Retailing for just $199, the Honor 6X gets a lot of the basics right. The phone has a chassis crafted out of aluminum, a 5.5-inch Full HD panel, Huawei's own Kirin 655 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB storage, and a dual camera setup at the back. You also get a dual-SIM card tray, but LTE connectivity is limited to the first SIM card — the second SIM is automatically switched to 2G. The Honor 6X also received the EMUI 5.0 update a few months ago, bringing Android 7.0 Nougat and a redesigned user interface that fixed a lot of issues from earlier versions. Oh, and there's an app drawer now. Bottom line: If you're looking for a budget phone that offers great value for money, the Honor 6X is a great choice. One more thing: The Honor 6X is a GSM-only device, and as such it isn't compatible with Verizon or Sprint.
Conclusion
The OnePlus 5 is your best choice if you're looking for a future-proof phone with dual-SIM capabilities. The phone has a great display, top-of-the-line specs, and a software experience that's one of the best available. Support for 34 LTE bands means you'll be able to use the phone in most countries around the world, and with two SIM card slots available, you won't need to switch out your primary SIM card.

Demons lifted by late field goal
By Mike Ramczyk
sports@southernlakesnewspapers.com
BURLINGTON – Cora Anderson picked one heck of a time to make their first field goal of the season.
The Burlington football team's sophomore kicker, who had fallen inches shy on several attempts this season, finally boomed one through the uprights, and it helped the host Demons clinch a playoff berth Friday night for the first time since 2014 with a 17-6 victory over a banged-up Wilmot squad.
Playing in its annual Homecoming game, Burlington improved to 5-3 overall with its third straight victory and 4-2 in the Southern Lakes Conference, assuring the playoff criteria of a winning conference mark.
Anderson, an Iowa State soccer recruit, scored the game's final points with a 30-yard field goal at the 5:48 mark, capping a short Burlington drive after a Wilmot lost fumble. They barely made a 25-yarder, but a false start forced the team back five yards. Then, a season's worth of tough-luck misses was erased as Anderson boomed their kick through the uprights with room to spare.
“I was really nervous when they had to back it up five yards after my first attempt,” Anderson said. “Grant had a great hold and I knew if I made it, it would give my team a great advantage. I also had a lot of adrenaline because we were ahead and had a good chance of going to the playoffs.”
“She definitely hit that second one,” said Burlington head coach Steve Tenhagen. “I told them last week after missing two field goals, we're going to need them at some point this year. Tonight was the night. For them to step up and hit that one was pretty special.”
Tenhagen said the Demons played a complete game, and the coaching staff had a feeling it would be a run-heavy offense in rainy conditions.
“It feels great,” Tenhagen added. “It's been a few years since we've beaten a team that tends to finish in the top half of the league. To see what we see right now is why you do this.”
“The ball was wet, and we couldn't grip it. I'm pleased with the way we responded up front. The defense knew what we were going to do, but we were able to put some points on the board. In terms of team effort on both sides of the ball, this was our best performance of the year.”
Due to rainy conditions, Burlington was forced to surrender its pass-happy approach in the first half, and the smash-mouth method worked wonders. Grant Tully ran for more than 100 yards in the first half, including a 51-yard touchdown, and Nick Klug added a short touchdown run to give Burlington a 14-6 halftime lead.
Wilmot was without star quarterback A.J. Frisby, who was out with a knee injury, and leading rusher Austin Norton went out with an injury in the first quarter. Running back Robert Brent was forced to play quarterback, which limited the Panther attack.
Wilmot, which lost three fumbles in the game, lost a crucial one midway through the third quarter around midfield, as Brent's pitch on an option was lost and recovered by Tully.
A steady rushing diet of Klug, Tully and Zach Anderson moved the ball inside the Wilmot 10, setting up Anderson's clutch kick.
Wilmot's lone score came on a one-play drive after a Burlington muffed snap on a punt deep in its own territory. Brent scampered 25 yards, and a missed extra point made it 7-6.
Tully finished with 158 yards on 23 carries.
“The atmosphere is awesome right now,” they said. “We haven't made the playoffs in a few years. It's Homecoming, and it's good to get a win against a good team. We're back in the playoffs, and it's pretty cool.”
Defense dominant for Burlington
Burlington held the Panthers scoreless in the second half and only surrendered 228 total yards. Brent battled their way to 104 yards on 20 carries, but the Panthers were often hampered by critical turnovers and bad field position.
Burlington's defense dominated with nine tackles for loss and three sacks, led by Josh Letkewicz's three tackles behind the line and one sack.
Burlington didn't turn the ball over and won the time of possession, 26 minutes to 21.
“Our defense had a tremendous night,” Tenhagen said. “I'm very pleased with how they responded. Injuries are unfortunately part of the game. We've been on the other end of that in different seasons. We didn't know who was playing quarterback, and their back went down. We played physical, we played fast, and any time you allow single digits, that's good.”
Harrison George led the Demons with 7.5 tackles.
“It's a real special night,” George said. “I was unfortunate enough to be on the playoff team my first-year student year. We need to take care of Elkhorn next week, but I'm excited to see what happens with these guys. The sky's the limit.”
“We knew it would be a dog fight with this weather. The defense played great and stretched plays out. The ‘D' totally gritted this one out.”
For Wilmot coach Keiya Square, it was a frustrating night without the starting quarterback and starting running back. The Panthers now find themselves in a winner-take-all game with rival Westosha next week, as the winner will advance to the playoffs and the loser will be left out.
“We just didn't get the job done,” Square said. “I thought we had a good game plan, but Austin Norton going down put a wrench in what we wanted to do. The kids that played all played hard. In the second half, we had terrible field position on our first few possessions. We just didn't make the plays when we were there.”
“We asked Brent to do something he's never done before, and they did a really good job. They carried our run game, and they made some throws at the end. A lot of people can say the experiment didn't work, but who knows what would've happened without the ball in their hands.”
Despite the playoff berth, Tenhagen isn't looking too far ahead. The Demons travel to Elkhorn (1-7) next Friday.
“We have to finish the season strong, and it's an important game,” Tenhagen said. “When it comes to the seeding meeting, you want to move up. Any time you can stay out of the 7 or 8 spots, seeding is a big part of the playoffs, and next Friday will be crucial.”
“We were closer to a complete game tonight, and progress is something we talk about quite a bit. It's so important to play your best football at the end of the season, and I think we're doing that right now.”

TORONTO – One of the most polarizing figures in Ontario politics is officially launching their bid for the leadership of the provincial Tories on Saturday, with an expected attack on both the party they hope to lead and the one they want to topple.
Doug Ford, brother of late Toronto mayor Rob Ford, will hold a rally to kick off their effort to helm a party reeling from allegations that have left it without a leader just months before a provincial election.
Accusations of sexual misconduct prompted the resignation of Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown last month, forcing a contest to determine who will carry the Tory banner against Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne.

Ford, who was the first to announce their candidacy, says it's time to wrest control of the party from “elites” and speak up for people they feel have been shortchanged by Wynne's government.
Political observers say the combination of name recognition, a well-defined message and open disdain for an unpopular government mean Ford could mount a credible challenge for the Tory leadership.
“Doug Ford can't be underestimated in this race,” said Rob Leone, a former Progressive Conservative member of the Ontario legislature and current political science professor at Western University.
Leone said Ford, who was a city councillor until a failed mayoral bid in 2014, has a leg up thanks to an established ground game and support organization, which could be key assets as leadership hopefuls scramble to meet a tight, five-week timeline. Voting to choose the new leader begins March 2, with results to be unveiled March 10.

“The advantage of having a defined brand is it allows people to identify with that brand,” they said. “It allows them to sign up to join that team and that movement. I think that when you have a less established brand, it becomes harder to do.”
Leone said Ford may even have what it takes to find traction beyond the greater Toronto area. In a province where Wynne's Liberals have taken a beating in the polls over consumer-friendly issues such as rising electricity rates, they said Ford's messages may find favour “in all pockets of the province.”
A recent study between The Canadian Press and EKOS Research, for instance, identified one Ontario community as the most likely in the country to respond to a populist movement.

In the national poll, 38 per cent of respondents in Oshawa held viewpoints suggesting they had a negative perception of their own economic outlook and the prospects for the next generation's, as well as a sense they're not getting ahead. Those themes figure prominently in Ford's political rhetoric. The results were well ahead of the national average.
Laure Paquette, a political science professor at Lakehead University, agreed that Ford would likely find support in more far-flung areas of the province that have voiced discontent with the status quo.
Paquette said Ford's name is known in northern Ontario, and their populist message will “play well” relative to the more moderate tone expected by declared contenders such as former MPP Christine Elliott.
But Paquette said Ford's appeal to a specific type of voter won't be enough to help them carry the day, saying party members may choose to focus on a leader with a better shot of defeating Wynne.
Paquette said Ford's message will also likely be overshadowed by what is expected to be a faceoff between Elliott and Caroline Mulroney, the daughter of a former prime minister who is widely expected to announce their own candidacy in the coming days.
“I think he's going to get drowned out,” they said. “The donnybrook between Caroline and Christine Elliott will be one for the ages.”

Andrew Marr has been praised for their "inspirational determination" after they shared the story of their recovery from a stroke on national television.
In a BBC2 documentary titled Andrew Marr: My Brain And Me shown on Tuesday night, the journalist investigated the workings of the brain, met survivors and underwent experimental US treatment that helped them regain movement after suffering a stroke in 2013.
Among viewers who commended both Marr themselves and the documentary creators, @elymusic1 posted on Twitter: "Fascinating and courageous programme from @AndrewMarr9 about strokes on BBC just now. The brain is complex and amazing."
@faberbishopp added: "Inspiring doc from @AndrewMarr9 tonight. No quick fix on stroke recovery but their determination will surely inspire others."
Best known on television for grilling the biggest names in national politics on their Sunday morning BBC programme, The Andrew Marr Show, the 57-year-old broadcaster shared both their deeply personal and humorous sides.
Finishing the hour-long documentary, they joked: "I know the BBC has a special contract that I'm to burst into tears at one point in this programme, but I can't do it, I'm from Dundee."
But in a heartfelt closing message to all viewers, they said: " If there's any lesson from this, it's worth never giving up."
In keeping with Marr's dry wit, viewer @pigglespalz posted: "You may not like this Mr Marr, but you are inspirational. Keep fighting."
Who doesn't love? This jolly, rotund individual with the big white beard is loved and revered by all. In fact, they are the ultimate uniter. I defy you to tell me any religion that doesn't at least smile somewhat (regardless of how they feel about Christmas) when they see this iconic being.has been portrayed by people of all walks of life. Some looking like the Jolly Ole Saint Nick we see in Norman Rockwell paintings, and other's looking like Don Knotts. Santa is a symbol and that symbol has found no better home (no pun intended) than on the silver screen.
For years this character has been portrayed in movies. They have appeared in cameos and starring roles. In fact, it seems that just adding Santa Claus (and the holiday season) to a film can make it have a longer life. People love nostalgia. They love the warm fuzzies and Santa Claus is truly representative of that. With the holidays now in full swing we know that you are busy. We know that there are things you just can't be bothered to do. However, if you knew that you had a bunch of Santa Claus movies to enjoy, chances are this would make the holidays feel a bit less stressful.
So that is why we have assembled a list of the 15 best Santa Claus movies of all time. As we have stated, Santa can come in many shapes and sizes. They can truly be all things to all people. Whether he's playing the guy running the reindeer (or running from the law), it seems pretty universal that Santa Claus is a character everybody wants to see.
The Santa Clause (1994)
Tim Allen places Santa in this 90s comedy that has proven timeless since it's release. The plot is simple. When Scott Calvin (Allen) unfortunately kills Santa Claus on Christmas Eve}, they end up having to take their place and deliver gifts to all the children of the world. The premise may seem hokey but movies about Santa Claus always seem to thrive on the fact that they can reside in the realm of magic. Sure, this might not be hight art but who really wants to see that after a rough day of Christmas shopping?
Elf (2003)
Will Ferrell gives a career best performance as Buddy the Elf.  They are a grown man living as an elf and this is causing major problems in the North Pole. So, Buddy goes to the USofA to discover who they really are. It turns out their birth father is a man named Walter Hobbs (James Caan) and, as you can guess, Hobbs isn't falling all over themselves to claim this elf-man as their son. What ensues is a wildly entertaining family romp that also skews nicely towards adults. They don't usually make Santa Claus movies with this much sass and that is probably a good thing!
Bad Santa (2003)
Billy Bob Thornton and director Terry Zwigoff basically turned the Santa Claus movie on its head here. What this film lacks in Christmas spirit it makes up for in tough love. Billy Bob plays Willie.  They are a conman of the highest order. Willie has one goal. They want to pull a robbery on Christmas Eve by posing as a department store Santa. The premise is unwieldy. The execution is flawless and darn if it if, by the end of the movie, you don't love this Bad Santa and all of their foulmouthed drunken ways.
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)
What is Jack Skellington, the ruler of Halloween Town, to do? He's discovered this place called Christmas Town and now they want to have Christmas on Halloween. The brilliance of this concept from Director Henry Selick (from a story written by Tim Burton) is that this is and isn't a Santa Claus movie. Sure, it takes a very different look at Christmas. However, that is precisely what makes it the kind of film that is perfect for the Holidays. Add to this that you have corpses, demons, mummy's and other oddballs in this Santa Claus film and it is easy to see why it is so beloved after all these years.
The Polar Express (2004)
A film about a boy taking a special train that transports them to the home of Santa Claus. Can you say slam dunk? Sure, a lot of people love to talk about the majestic artistry of this film. Once you get passed all the technical gobbledygook and the dead eyed stares of most of the characters, you have a Santa Claus film that really captures the heart of the season. There is a richness and a depth to The Polar Express that really seems to work despite this film being in love with technology. The fact that you have Tom Hanks playing multiple roles (yes, they play Santa Claus) only adds to this movie's warmth and holiday cheer.
Fred Claus (2007)
Wanting to be Bad Santa but constricted by its PG rating actually seems to help Fred Claus. Vince Vaughn plays the title character. He's one big, no goodnik of a man who doesn't really care for their older brother... Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti). However, Santa Claus needs help during the busy Christmas season, their brother Fred needs money, so it seems like they have an accord. As you can guess, these two distant family members end up coming together in the most unexpected of ways. Both Vaughn and Giamatti are quite deft with comedy and that is what really helps carry this semi-oddball of a Santa Claus movie.
Arthur Christmas (2011)
How cool is a Santa Claus movie that is voiced by James McAvoy? Arthur Christmas tells the tale of the lovable Arthur. They don't really do anything well, but man oh man do they try.  They are given a mission to return a misplaced gift and he's going to make this happen in-spite of himself. With other voice cast members that include Jim Broadbent and Bill Nighy, Arthur Christmas might be one of the lesser known Santa Claus movies. However, like its main character, never judge a book by its cover. And isn't that, in a very roundabout way, what the season of giving is all about?
Rare Exports (2010)
Rare Exports has Santa Claus in it. However, this isn't your grandparents Santa. This oddity from Finland features a Santa Claus who is dug up during an archaeological excavation. Things get even stranger when young kids start to go missing. Suddenly, a vigilante group of sorts takes it upon themselves to nab Santa and get rid of him. These men may have guns but Santa has elves and that just might be the equalizer here. What follows is a crazy adventure that sort of makes a political statement about the commercialization of Christmas. As I said, this isn't really a Santa Claus tale you've seen before but that is what makes it so memorable.
Ernest Saves Christmas (1988)
Jim Varney may not reek of the Christmas spirit but that doesn't mean that Ernest Saves Christmas doesn't have a lot to offer. The storyline is simple: Santa is looking for somebody to take their place and Ernest P. Worrell (Varney) is determined to make that happen. If it doesn't than Christmas would be done and that is just unthinkable. This film, despite its silliness, is really a Santa Claus film that is filled with heart and emotion. On top of that, and not many Santa Claus movies can boast this: Douglas Seale's Santa Claus is probably the most realistic depiction to ever grace the silver screen.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) A Florida man has been sentenced to six years and five months in prison for accidentally shooting a gun while taking a selfie in a strip club restroom.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa announced 34-year-old Rorn Sorn's sentencing Monday. The Asian Pride Gang member pleaded guilty in April to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.
Court documents say Sorn was at Club Lust in St. Petersburg in December when their gun discharged. The bullet went through the mirror and into the adjacent women's restroom. No injuries were reported.
A security guard approached Sorn as they were leaving, and Sorn reportedly told the guard that it was an accident and that they “was just trying to take a selfie.” Police responded, and officers found a handgun, ammunition and drugs on Sorn.
Sorn has prior felony convictions for burglary and attempted first-degree murder.

This is the third in a series breaking down every game on Louisville's 2018 football schedule and analyzing how the Cardinals can beat each opponent, and how they can lose to each opponent. Previous installments: Alabama | Western Kentucky.
Scouting report: Western Kentucky
Most importantly, WKU lost talented starting quarterback Mike White, a fifth-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys. The returning quarterbacks threw a combined 13 passes for WKU last season. Fifth-year senior Drew Eckels, redshirt sophomore Steven Duncan and redshirt first-year student Davis Shanley are the contenders for the job.
The Hilltoppers struggled to run the ball last season, relying on White and the passing game for most of their offense. Of the top three receivers with at least 600 yards, only Lucky Jackson returns. Though WKU finished nine spots ahead of Louisville in total defense last season, against inferior competition, the Hilltoppers don't present much of a threat.

How Louisville can beat Western Kentucky
For the second straight week, the young Cardinals have to find a way to win as the better team. They might find an advantage running the ball in this game, as WKU finished 70th against the run in 2017. Louisville's ground game is still developing and facing injuries, but the running backs shouldn't struggle to find space this week.
Also for the second straight week, Louisville will have a chance to bring pressure against the quarterback, taking advantage of an inexperienced WKU quarterback. September is a tough month for the visitors (WKU also opens at Wisconsin, a top-10 team). The Cards can do their offense a big favor if they create some havoc on defense.
WKU also finished tied for 111th in turnover margin last season, and with a new quarterback, it may struggle to improve on that mark early on. This game will be tougher than the Indiana State matchup the week before. But Louisville will have plenty of time to make plays.
It's also another home night game, so the Cards are going to have the crowd factor on their side.

How Louisville can lose to Western Kentucky
For the second straight week, it's hard to see the Cardinals losing. But if they do, it'll be because their young defense flops against a WKU program that tends to be inventive offensively. That would require speedy development from whoever wins the starting quarterback job.
Here's a dark horse for the quarterback battle: incoming first-year student Kevaris Thomas. The No. 22 dual-threat quarterback in the 2018 recruiting class according to 247sports.com's composite rankings, Thomas is WKU's highest-rated recruit. They may need some experience first, but a threat in the running game would add another dimension for Louisville's defense. If Brian VanGorder's unit struggles with a true first-year student in Week 3, though, the forecast for the rest of the season will be gloomy.
Louisville will likely outgain WKU, in which case turnovers might make things interesting. WKU coach Mike Sanford said last month that many of their players from the state “would love nothing more” than to beat Louisville, so we know the Hilltoppers are going to be fired up.
Elsewhere, Sanford's father, Mike Sr., is an assistant on the WKU staff and was the last head coach at Indiana State from 2013-16. Maybe they have some contacts at their old school who can give them the scoop on Louisville after they visit on Sept. 8.

The rescue work would resume on Monday.Teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Army and the police were rushed to the spot and heavy earth-moving machinery was deployed at the gorge where the two buses lay buried under a heap of wreckage.Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh visited the spot and said the rescue operation would continue till all the bodies were recovered.He said that eight passengers were travelling in the Manali-Katra bus, of whom three lost their lives, while five were rescued and taken to the zonal hospital in Mandi.There were around 47 passengers in the second bus which was on its way from Manali to Chamba, an official said.The chief minister said the state government would bear medical expenses of the injured.

A charity which made unauthorised payments and failed to keep proper records of decision-making is the first to have received an official warning from the Charity Commission.
The Derbyshire-based National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline was set up by Wendy Watson in 1996 after they underwent a pre-emptive double mastectomy four years earlier, when they were 37.
The procedure became more well-known after Hollywood actor and humanitarian Angelina Jolie had the operation to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer.
Figures from the accounts show that in 2014/15 the charity's total expenses were £909,634 - of which only 3%, or £27,403, was listed as being spent on "charitable activities", with £874,539 set down as "fundraising expenses and other costs".
The following financial year, total expenses were £947,824, of which £929,975 was spent on charitable activities.
The accounts also show the charity owed Mrs Watson £62,000 after they gave the money in an unsecured loan - with trustees approving a repayment of £30,000.
The figures from 2015/16 show their daughter was paid £17,849 in salary and expenses during the year for work as a fundraiser.
The Charity Commission said the cause's trustees "committed a breach of trust or duty" after "making unauthorised payments to a connected person" and "entering into an informal loan agreement with a connected person".
Mrs Watson resigned as a trustee in October 2016, according to a report, but the watchdog said the charity allowed the former chairperson to "make key decisions about the operation of the charity, despite having resigned".
It added: "Given the nature and seriousness of the issues, the trustees were given a chance to resolve them but failed to fully comply with the action plan to do so, the commission concluded it was appropriate and proportionate to issue the charity with an official warning to promote compliance.
"The warning specifies the actions the commission considers the charity needs to take to resolve the outstanding and prevent further breaches."
These include ensuring that any payments to individuals are made lawfully and that consent from the watchdog is obtained if needed.
Mrs Watson told the Press Association: "I work on a voluntary basis for the charity. It's cost me, I've never made anything out of it. It's cost me tens of thousands of pounds to keep this helpline going, and I mean tens of thousands. And all it's ever done is save lives and save money."
In the last five years they said they have worked for "less than 60p an hour", adding that they have received "terrible" advice from a solicitor and an accountant.
They said they were named as a trustee when the helpline was made a registered charity in 2012, and said: "I thought it was OK. I had no idea that I could never be employed or paid, no idea at all."
Mrs Watson said: "I can categorically say I have not benefited one iota out of this."
They added: " After putting every bit of yourself into something that you've believed in and you know has done so much good - you know that, that it's done so much good - after you've done that, and then you get accused of whatever, just because you made some errors, simple as that."

NORRISTOWN, Pa. — With fatigue appearing to set in, jurors in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial reviewed portions of their accuser's testimony Wednesday as they deliberated for a third day over whether the 79-year-old star drugged and molested them at their suburban Philadelphia estate.
Jurors made the request to have portions of Andrea Constand's testimony read back to them but ended the day without a verdict in a case that has already helped demolish Cosby's nice-guy reputation. They will resume deliberations Thursday morning.
The panel of seven men and five women worked late for the third night in a row, asking for testimony about a detective's interview with Cosby in early 2005, about a year after Constand says the comedian assaulted them They ordered strombolis for dinner while a court reporter raced to transcribe that portion of last week's testimony.

As deliberations crossed the 27-hour mark, some jurors closed their eyes and tilted their heads down as a court reporter reread Cosby's January 2005 interview. One slunk down in their seat, looking angry.
“Can you find 12 people who will agree? That's the question,” said criminal lawyer Alan J. Tauber, who wasn't involved in the case.
On Wednesday, the group wanted to hear from both Cosby and their accuser.

Constand testified last week that Cosby gave their pills that left them woozy, helped them to a couch and then violated them while they were passed out, unable to say no or fight their advances.
The 44-year-old Toronto woman, who spent seven hours on the stand last week, was in the gallery as portions of their testimony were read back to the jury.
The panel also wanted to hear again from Cosby, who didn't testify at their trial but gave a deposition as part of Constand's civil suit against them and submitted to a police interview about their accusations.
Pennsylvania detectives spoke to Cosby in their lawyers' New York City offices a few weeks after Constand went to police in January 2005. Cosby said in the interview that they gave them Benadryl, an over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine, to help them relax. They said they didn't show any ill effects from the medicine, nor did they object as they groped them
Constand's mother wiped away tears at times as the interview was read.
Cosby's lawyers maintain Constand was a willing sexual partner.

The long days appeared to be wearing on jurors.
“This is an incredible jury that has just acted with incredible dignity and fidelity, … and I don't have any higher praise,” Judge Stephen O'Neill told the panel before they broke for the night. “You have taken your task so seriously.”
Constand denies there was any romance between them and told jurors they had rebuffed their advances before the assault. They believe they gave them something stronger than Benadryl on the night they say they molested them

Cosby is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Each carries a maximum 10-year prison term, though the counts could be merged at sentencing if they are convicted.
The first prosecutor to review the case in 2005 passed on it. A successor, District Attorney Kevin Steele, reversed course a decade later, after dozens of women came forward to accuse Cosby of sexual misconduct and after the public release of their startling deposition in which they spoke about giving the powerful sedative quaaludes to women they wanted to have sex with.
The long-married Cosby, once known as America's Dad for their portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” called all the encounters consensual.
The Rev. Andrew F. Kline, a vicar of a historic black church in Norristown who stopped by the courthouse steps Wednesday to check out the scene, said their congregation is “absolutely” talking about the case given Cosby's place in their lives.
“He was huge. They were huge. They were a role model. They couldn't escape that,” Kline said. “You probably want it on one level, as a celebrity. They made some powerful statements that people either said, ‘Yeah, Amen,' or ‘That's not the way we are.'
“So it's always difficult to look under the hood and see the reality of our lives,” Kline said. “I pray for him. I pray for them I pray for everybody here that justice be done, but that there be some mercy, too, right? I mean, we need to be about that.”
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.
Over the weekend, Star Wars fans were finally given the gift they've been wanting in the form of the very first teaser trailer for The Last Jedi. While some have expressed vague disappointment in the teaser, the general consensus has been excitement. For those who may have felt a little underwhelmed, there is an explanation; Star Wars: The Last Jedi pretty much has the same trailer as Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
You may be thinking, "What? No they are not the same!" But thanks to some detailed analyzation of the two trailers by YouTuber James Van Fleet, it is clear that there are a lot of similarities. This isn't so much trying to say that the The Last Jedi trailer looks exactly like the trailer for The Force Awakens, but more that it hits the exact same beats. It should be noted that the comparison is being made to the second trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens and not the first, very brief teaser. Here is what James Van Fleet had to say about their observations in the description provided for the video.
"If the Last Jedi teaser trailer feels familiar to you, that's because it has the exact same rhythm, sound cues, and many of the same image beats of the globe-smashing Force Awakens Teaser #2 (with a quick opening BOO! moment borrowed from the Force Awakens Teaser #1). Lucasfilm/Disney has figured out how to make a "Star Wars" trailer, and they are sticking like hell to that formula. (And honestly, why shouldn't they?)"
In order to prove their point, the video goes through the trailers frame by frame and, using a handy sidebar that lists the beats of each trailer, shows that these trailers both carry the same formula. For example, both the Star Wars Episode VII and Star Wars Episode VIII trailers open with landscapes and a shot of Rey, which is followed by the "Twin Suns" theme and some narration from Luke Skywalker. Both trailers then have a callback to Darth Vader, some more narration from Luke and then a callback to R2-D2. It goes on like this.
So, even though the Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer looks very different, it probably feels very much the same, even if you might not have realized it until now. It is hard to say if this was intentionally done by Lucasfilm, or if it was just an odd coincidence, but it would be tough to blame them for wanting to use the same formula that brought so much success with Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The movie did wind up grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. Why try to fix something that isn't broken?
Star Wars 8 stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern, Gwendoline Christie, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'O, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is written and directed by Rian Johnson and is set for release on December 15. Be sure to check out the video comparing the two trailers for yourself below.

KARACHI - The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Centre and the PMA Karachi demanded to the government exempt medical personnel including doctors and nurses from performing election duties; otherwise our health delivery system will collapse on the election day.
A high level meeting of the PMA Centre and the PMA Karachi was held at PMA House, Karachi. Noted with concern and took notice of the situation according to which doctors at large has been nominated for performing duties in elections on the day of polling in the country. Paradoxically the doctors from the tertiary care hospitals are being nominated for election duties. As it is a well-known fact that medical practitioners are always considered as the people of essential services.
They already have a big responsibility to provide health care during any circumstances. 25th of July will be a very sensitive day. In the present situation doctors are supposed to deal with not only normal medical and surgical emergencies but God forbid in case of violence or terrorist attacks, their services become more vital. The PMA strongly demanded that all medical personnel including doctors and nurses be spared from performing election duties, otherwise our health delivery system will collapse on the day. So let these people focus on providing much needed medical cover to the people across the country.

Melania Trump remains a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma almost one year after moving into the White House. When not seen dodging the president's hand or decrying internet bullies, a question arises among the press: Just where is the First Lady?
She's not appeared publicly in 20 days, per CNN, perhaps sparking a tweet Wednesday from their account: "I see the media is working overtime speculating where I am & what I'm doing. Rest assured, I'm here at the @WhiteHouse w my family, feeling great, & working hard on behalf of children & the American people!"
Many noted that "working overtime" appears repeatedly in President Trump's tweets, leading many to think they dictated it. That, too, remains a mystery.

As the 'Roseanne' empire crumbles, Trump speaks: I should get an apology, too!
After a racist tweet from Roseanne Barr resulted in the cancellation of TV's No. 1 show, Trump — who's friendly with Barr — weighed in on the the drama around their famous fan: They deserve an apology. "Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let them know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr," Trump tweeted Wednesday. "Gee, they never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?" Jarrett, the one-time Obama advisor, said Trump set the tone that came out in Barr's tweet.
Trump, who once sang Roseanne's praises in Ohio, stayed silent on them at their Tuesday rally.

I wish I had quit you: Trump drags Jeff Sessions amid Russia drama
After Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy said Trump could've picked someone besides Jeff Session for attorney general, the president had five words: "And I wish I did!" Trump's tweet followed a New York Times report that investigators want to know just how Trump tried to stop Sessions from backing out of the Russia investigation over their Kremlin contacts. Meanwhile, a Senate panel is ramping up for Congress' last weigh-in on Russia, and those on the committee — from Trump fan Tom Cotton to Trump critic Kamala Harris — remain hopeful they'll reach a bipartisan conclusion on whether Trump's campaign colluded with Putin & Co.

Mexico to Trump on funding that wall: 'Not now, not ever'
Trump this week dusted off a crowd-pleasing promise largely missing since their campaign days: Mexico will pay for the wall. That vow, made again at Tuesday's rally, found swift repudiation from Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. "Mexico will never pay for a wall. Not now, not ever," they tweeted, signed "Mexico (all of us)." On Wednesday, advocates called on U.S. immigration authorities to stop holding transgender migrants seeking asylum in detention centers after a 33-year-old transgender woman died while in custody at a New Mexico facility. Border policies on asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors and families have become conflated in recent weeks. The debate comes as Republican Republicans embrace a Trump-style immigration platform in ads (14,000 of which have run this year).

Sheriff's officials say the case is closed on the recent death of a 26-year-old suspected of overdosing on methamphetamine at the West Hollywood apartment of political influencer Ed Buck. But the mother of the man, Gemmel Moore, says Buck should be held accountable for their son's death.
Moore's mother, LaTisha Nixon, says that about a year ago their son called them crying about Buck. They were scared, they say, and their experiences with the 62-year-old inspired them to leave Los Angeles and return to their Texas home. They also say they were struggling with homelessness and an HIV diagnosis.
A day before their death, Moore flew back to Los Angeles, according to Nixon. They say Buck sent them a plane ticket. "My second oldest son took them to the airport, texted me, said they made it," they say. "Five, six hours later I get a phone call. They tell me my son is dead."
Forty-six-year-old tech support worker John Bice lives near Moore's mother in Texas and says they tried to counsel the man away from drugs when Moore was in town this summer.
"Basically they told me this guy [Buck] would find young struggling black guys around town, pick them up and say they were going to help them out — make sure they had clothes and food," Bice says. "He said it wasn't an uncommon thing that there were several young guys like them in and out of the house or who hung around all the time. They wanted to see them get high, first with weed. Then one day the guy wanted them [Moore] to shoot up. He'd wake up after being shot up naked in bed."
Buck did not respond to requests for comment.
Moore died July 27 at a residence in the 1200 block of North Laurel Avenue in West Hollywood, according Los Angeles County coroner's officials. Sheriff's Lt. Edward Ramirez says the death was reported at 10:10 p.m. and gave an address and apartment number that matches the address and apartment number that Buck has listed as their residence in public documents.
The initial cause was listed as accidental, with meth serving as the agent of death, according to coroner's records. But an exact determination could take months: Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports, and there's a backlog of cases.
"This preliminary information was from somebody with them as they were doing meth, and they [coroner's officials at the scene] collected suspected illicit drugs, pipes and a number of items," says Department of Medical-Examiner Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter. "He had a history of methamphetamine use."
Winter also says the case is closed. “According to our information they were visiting their friend's residence and, witnessed by their friend, they become warm after using methamphetamine around 5 p.m.,” Winter says. “[The unnamed friend] got them some ice, then noticed they became unresponsive, notified a neighbor who has medical knowledge, who gave them CPR. Paramedics arrived, weren't able to resuscitate him, and they were pronounced at the scene.”
The death was first reported by WeHoTimes.com.
Earlier today, pages reportedly from Moore's diary that describe their drug use with Buck were published on the blog of journalist and political consultant Jasmyne Cannick. Cannick writes: "Among Moore's personal belongings collected by their family today from the coroner's office was a journal in which they document their feelings about the direction of their life and the role of Ed Buck in it."
One undated journal entry states: “I've become addicted to drugs and the worse [sic] one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank, they gave me my first injection of chrystal [sic] meth. It was very painful but after all the troubles I became addicted to the pain and fetish/fantasy. … I just hope the end result isn't death. … If it didn't hurt so bad I'd kill myself but I'll let Ed Buck do it for now.”
Buck, a onetime male model, burst on the national spotlight in 1987 when they led the effort to recall then-Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, a politician who has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump. Buck, who at the time was a Republican, made money in the insurance services business and decamped to West Hollywood, remaining active in politics and becoming a Democrat. They unsuccessfully ran for West Hollywood City Council, successfully ran a campaign to rid the city of fur retailers, and poured money into election efforts. Their political activity has placed them in photographs with Hillary Clinton and Gov. Jerry Brown. They once clashed with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
There's no open sheriff's investigation into Moore's death, Ramirez of the West Hollywood sheriff's station says. "There isn't anything suspicious about it," they say. "There's nothing pointing towards death at the hands of another, so it's not something we would do any follow-up on."
Moore's mother, Nixon, says they fear that Buck's prominent standing in West Hollywood is affecting the decision to close the case. From their home in Spring, Texas, they have been digging into the events leading up to Moore's demise.
Moore was raised in Victorville. They moved out when they were 17, according to Nixon, who says they moved to Texas five years ago. They say their son found roommates, couch surfed, partied and did what they could to survive in urban Los Angeles. After they moved to their home in spring they discovered they were HIV-positive, they say.
"I didn't know any of that until they came here," they say. "He tested when they came out here. They didn't look their normal self."
"I never expected them to go back out there" to L.A., says Bice, who counseled Moore. "He definitely was scared. They were also battling depression. They were lonely. I figured they were trying to get back out there to see friends they had out there."
Nixon says friends of their son told them about Buck and their alleged proclivity for watching young men shoot up methamphetamine.
Childhood friend Samuel Lloyd, 28, says Moore roomed with them in South Los Angeles for two years recently. They say they heard from Moore and another friend that Buck enjoyed watching young men get high.
“He would need money for something or whatever,” Lloyd says of Moore.
Lloyd says that after they found out about Moore's death they took their story to police but that they haven't followed up.
Nixon says they too talked to a sheriff's deputy about it, and the the deputy responded: "We're just going to treat it as an accidental overdose.”
When the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun was hit this month with an attack of poison gas, the incident drew international condemnation and prompted the Trump administration to launch a retaliatory missile strike.
On Friday, there was another incident: A rocket loaded with chlorine gas struck the neighborhood of Abar in the Iraqi city of Mosul, injuring several soldiers. This one, though, was not fired by the government. Iraqi military officials said it was launched by the militant group Islamic State.
As the U.S. government backed by the international community continues to draw a red line around the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons in its long-running war against Islamic State and other rebels, there is growing evidence that deadly chemical agents are also becoming part of the jihadist group's arsenal.
Islamic State has used chemical weapons, including chlorine and sulfur, at least 52 times on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq, according to a study released in November by IHS Conflict Monitor, a London-based intelligence collection and analysis service.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it had confirmed that Islamic State fighters had deployed sulfur mustard, commonly known as mustard gas, in an attack on the Syrian town of Marea, near Aleppo, in August 2015. The internationally banned substance burns a victim's skin, throat and eyes.
“In this case, the team was able to confirm with utmost confidence that at least two people were exposed to sulfur mustard, and that it is very likely that the effects of this chemical weapon resulted in the death of an infant," the organization said in a statement.
There have been other cases:
On March 4, a dozen civilians from east Mosul were treated for suspected exposure to a blistering chemical agent after several rocket attacks by Islamic State, according to an Iraqi military official. The patients, including a 2-month-old baby, were transferred to a hospital in Irbil for treatment of symptoms of a chemical attack including blisters, burns, respiratory problems, irritation to the eyes and vomiting, the official said.
In northern Iraq, Islamic State fired mortar rounds loaded with sulfur mustard at Kurdish forces in October 2015, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said.
“There has been no question of where those mustard agents came from,” said Jerry Smith, former operations chief for the organization.
Chemical weapons such as chlorine gas, mustard gas and sarin are banned by most nations. They are especially difficult to defend against without protective gear, which is mostly absent on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria.
The attacks officials blame on Islamic State and other forces have not generated the death and destruction associated with the chemical attacks attributed to the Syrian government.
The attack this month in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun killed 86 people. The government of President Bashar Assad has denied responsibility and blamed opposition forces. It has also suggested the poison gas was inadvertently released during an airstrike on a rebel-held munitions depot.
In 2013, the U.S. and Syrian opposition groups accused forces loyal to Assad of lobbing sarin-filled shells at rebel-held enclaves near Damascus. According to U.S. estimates, more than 1,000 people were killed.
As a result, a deal pushed by Russia saw the government surrender its stockpiles of chemical weapons to the United Nations.
More than 95% of the government's arsenal was eliminated, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But the organization also said there have been chemical attacks since then by rebel and government forces.
Chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used by militant bomb makers in Iraq for years. But it was unclear how Islamic State obtained sulfur mustard.
Smith said militants could make warfare-grade mustard and chlorine “fairly easy.”
Former CIA Director John Brennan, who stepped down in January, said in an interview last year with CBS' “60 Minutes” that Islamic State had “the ability to manufacture small quantities of chlorine and mustard gas.”
The U.S-.led coalition has targeted Islamic State munitions depots and weapon-manufacturing sites with airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.
“We've long known that the enemy has aspired to use chemical weapons,” U.S. Col. John Dorrian, a Baghdad-based coalition spokesperson, said at a briefing in February. “Mustard agent is one that they've used many times.”
Dorrian called militants' capability to make chemical weapons “rudimentary,” but they emphasized that it was “very important that we continue to roll back their control of territory because this is not something that we want to wait and let [Islamic State] get good at.”
Smith thought it unlikely that militants had stockpiled large quantities of chemical weapons.
“If ISIS had manufactured these weapons, I'm sure we would have seen them used by now, with half of Mosul gone,” they said, suing an acronym for the militant group. “By this stage, I would have thought we'd have seen them and lots of them.”
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington–based Arms Control Assn., said some Islamic State units “have produced an improvised mustard gas type of shell” from mustard seeds in makeshift chemical laboratories, “but not chlorine.”
The chemical weapons could have been seized from industrial or Syrian government stockpiles, they and other experts said.
The governments of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and Assad once sponsored chemical warfare programs.
Assad was to hand over Syria's chemical weapons — including chlorine and nerve gas — to Smith's monitoring group to be destroyed four years ago. Smith said that their team removed weapons the government declared, but that “it was on a bit of a trust basis.”
Kimball noted Smith's group had difficulty checking the Syrian government's compliance.
“There were some areas the government would not allow them to go to verify it had been handed over,” they said of the chemical weapons. “It's possible even if they did turn everything over, they maintained the capacity and knowledge to manufacture the precursors.”
The U.N. has since found Syrian military helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on civilians in at least two attacks over the last three years.
ANNECY, France — Tuesday's Works in Progress session at the Annecy Festival for Base FX's “Wish Dragon” announces far more than the first 3D animated feature from a well-respected visual effects company, although it certainly did that. The session was a proclamation from a company intent on establishing a foundation that will be used for years to come in producing triple-A animated titles for a domestic audience of more than a billion people. “You don't build a factory to only produce 10 cars,” said Staphylas of Base FX's long term ambitions.“
Representing Base FX at the festival, for which China is the official guest country, were director Christopher Applehans, studio head of character animation Olivier Staphylas, Strange Weather producer Aron Warner, and from the Chinese studios, Sophie Xiao.
Base FX's move into high-end, high-production-value Chinese animation is a calculated gamble, but it's one which the company believes is doable if handled the right way.
“We are learning from where other companies struggled,” noted Staphylas. “In the past, it was big American studios wanting to enter China with a bang.” They pointed out that with its long history in the country, Base FX as a company already has a leg-up on its predecessors in its understanding of the market and the culture.
Base FX's commitment to its domestic market is most obvious when looking at its already assembled crew, which is a 50/50 mix of Chinese locals and ex-pats. The company is recruiting its staff from local industry professionals and a pool of former big American studio animators and designers, many of whom had been trained by Staphylas during their tenure at DreamWorks in India and China. “We basically grabbed people that weren't feeling satisfied by the Hollywood mindset.”
It is also important to note that the film is not a U.S.-China co-production. 100% of the funding is coming from China and “it's important that our mentality is that this is a Chinese film,” noted Staphylas.
It is important to Base that the ex-pat animators understand what they are animating. Xiao recalled: “We sent all the animators to Shanghai and made them eat all the street food and fall in love with some local boys and girls,” drawing a laugh from the packed auditorium.
Of the myriad of ways in which the original idea has been modified for the domestic Chinese audience, a few stood out. Applehans recalled that they originally wrote Din's mother based on a strict Asian-American model but that the first question asked by the Chinese staff after reading their parts was: “Why is the mom so nice?” Additionally, Warner pointed out that what the American staff thought was a small apartment was, “at least four times too big,” for a character in Din's situation.
The most touching moment of the conference was when Applehans discussed who they believed their audience was. “We would go up to strangers [in Shanghai] and ask: ‘If you had three wishes, what would they be?'” adding the caveat that the wishes must be for their kids. The answers were always the same: ‘I want them to get a good job, make a lot of money, and have a nice apartment.'”
Applehans then asked kids what their three wishes would be, which received a much broader range of answers, but one in particular stuck out. “He was just quiet for five minutes thinking so hard about it, like it was real. They looked up at me and they said: ‘I wish my parents were younger so I could live more of my life with them.' I thought about this kid who was such a fragile soul and them going into this world that is changing so fast, and I felt like right then I knew whom I was making the movie for.”
“Wish Dragon” will be a contemporary retelling of the Aladdin fable set in modern day China. All of the key elements of the tale will be present, with additional sub-plots added to speak directly to the target Chinese audience.
The main character, Din, is a young man raised by their single working class mother. One day Din stumbles across a dingy jade tea pot which hosts a magical wish dragon, Long, who will grant Din three wishes. Despite their centuries of existence, Long has gained little wisdom about the world and how it works, and really only values gold. The dragon is only visible to Din, a vehicle which will be delivering moments of comedy throughout the film.
After accidentally using their first wish to make themselves a kung-fu master, Din shirks conventional wish-usage wisdom and decides they will use their remaining wishes to reconnect with their childhood best friend and would-be soul-mate, Li Na. Long is incredulous towards the fact that Din would use their wishes so carelessly and just wants them to make the wishes as each wish dragon must serve 10 masters before they are allowed to return to the spirit world, and Din is Long's 10th.
While the as-to-be expected love story is key, the creators emphasize that equally important will be the relationship of Din and Long, and the way in which they help each other grow.
The film has a tentative release window of late-summer 2018, an ambitious date for a fledgling company, but one for which they are sure they will be ready. “I've worked on films that didn't even have a script at 15 months. I have no doubt we can do this,” asserted Warner.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, citing continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.The decision lifted the U.S. central bank's benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent as it proceeds with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade.In its statement following a two-day meeting, the Fed's policy-setting committee indicated the economy had been expanding moderately, the labor market continued to strengthen and a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory.The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession."The committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated," the Fed said in its statement.According to an addendum released with the policy statement, the Fed anticipates that the balance sheet reduction plan would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities.The Fed sees the cap for Treasury securities to be $6 billion per month initially, increasing in $6 billion increments at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month.
For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, increasing by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reaches $20 billion per month.Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT).EYES ON INFLATION
The Fed has now raised rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015. The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis.Policymakers also released their latest set of quarterly economic forecasts which showed temporary concern about inflation and continued confidence about economic growth in the coming years.They forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2017, an increase from the previous projection in March. Inflation was expected to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.A retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters among some Fed officials who fear that the shortfall, if sustained, could alter the pace of future rate hikes. Earlier on Wednesday, the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, the second drop in three months.
The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent, from 1.8 percent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years.Expectations of any fiscal stimulus in the near term from the Trump administration have also waned with campaign promises on tax cuts, regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress.Interest rates are seen rising one more time by the end of this year, according to the median projection of the forecasts released with the Fed's policy statement, in keeping with the previous forecast.Estimates for the unemployment rate by the end of this year moved down to 4.3 percent, the current level, and to 4.2 percent in 2018, indicating the Fed believes the labor market will continue to tighten.The median estimate of the long-run neutral rate, which is seen as the level of monetary policy that neither boosts nor slows the economy, was unchanged at 3.0 percent.Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented in Wednesday's decision.

Amazon has the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller on sale for $59. While we see discounts on these from time to time, they normally sell for $70 and rarely drop below this price. They have great reviews too.
The Pro Controller is perfect for anyone who feels like the Switch's Joy-Con controllers are too small for their hands. The Pro Controller is a bit larger than standard gaming controllers today, but it feels great to hold and it's not big enough where players with small hands wouldn't enjoy using it too. It takes the guesswork out of "how do I use these Joy-Cons?" and lets you focus on the game at hand.

Queens of the Stone Age have a new album coming out; so far, that's all anyone has been able to get them to admit. But the curtains are finally lifting: The band debuted a new website today, featuring a graphic of a vintage-y television set with eight staticky channels. According to this QOTSA tweet, the artwork was created by the artist Boneface:
Several phrases appear throughout the TV set and its channels, including “Mumbo Jumbo,” “13,” “Tutti Frutti,” “Reclaim Everything,” “It's a ‘Beautiful' Day in the U.S.A.,” “Askew,” “Gold Standard,” “Enteen,” “1976 Evil,” and “All My Confusion Is Waving Goodbye.” There are also a few mouse-over animations, including blinking eyes, a lit match, and a ghost who shoots pink electrical bolts. The “planet exploding” logo QOTSA posted on social media two months ago appears in the lower right.
As one Reddit sleuth was quick to note, Boneface created the artwork for New Skin, the 2016 album by Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi's band CRX. That album cover featured a motorcycle jacket emblazoned with words or symbols representing the album and song titles, so it's not much of a stretch to expect something similar for QOTSA. Perhaps the channels that are pure static now will reveal more in the coming weeks.
Check out the new Queens of the Stone Age teaser site for yourself here.

The real lesson here is that you can't trust any technology company to take care of your kids. Which means, if you want them to engage in technology, you should try enjoying it along with them.
Facebook's recently announced Messenger Kids, a chat app aimed at users between the ages of 6 and 13, seems like another garbage fire ready to erupt. The app has no ads, and it is tied to the account of a parent, who has to approve their kid's chat buddies. Still, it's already raising plenty of alarm for trying to hook children onto Facebook and phones at a formative age. So far, thankfully, it's only available in the U.S.
The streaming video giant has taken action and suspended channels, deleted videos and reprimanded creators in order to convince people it is a safe place to park your kids. This week the company announced it is hiring 10,000 moderators to combat the problem, which we would call a good start. We'll have to see it in action to see if it makes any real difference.
With recent reports of disturbing videos aimed at young kids — featuring nursery rhymes and characters such as Peppa Pig — that manage to sneak past content filters on YouTube, it's once again clear the internet is no place to let children just go play by themselves.
Despite its flaws, YouTube remains one of the best time sucks ever created. If you want your kids to safely use the site, create a playlist of acceptable videos that you have already vetted for them to see.
The good news is, in this holiday season, some of the biggest names in technology are actually putting a focus back on the family. Since I had to grab the iPad with the YouTube Kids app away from my 6-year-old and actually commit to some active parenting, here's a run-through of some of this season's hottest technology and how you can share that experience with the family.
Beyond that, there are plenty of other options. Netflix's Kids section is quite robust and since the content is all professionally produced, it should be safe from the “troll farmed” fakes. Another service, Jellies, is a video app that promises only safe, kid-friendly material for $5 a month.
The Big N
If there is one tech company that could give a lesson on how to be family friendly, it is Nintendo. The company has been resurgent this year, after launching its hybrid home/portable game console the Switch with a host of hot titles.
The biggest knock on the Switch is that it is expensive, starting at $499, adding up to more if you buy accessories, like extra controllers. Beyond that, the library so far has been quite good. For families, there are a number of good games like 1-2 Switch, Snipperclips and MarioKart 8 Deluxe. The recently released Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece and even has two-player mode where one player controls Mario and the other plays as their sentient hat, Cappy.
If the Switch is too rich for your blood, the SNES Classic also launched this year, with 21 classic games, a $100 price tag and nostalgia to burn.
Co-pilot mode
While Microsoft has been making a lot of hay about how powerful the latest Xbox is, it's this neat feature in one of the recent system updates that might help bring gamers and wannabes together. The update allows two controllers that can control the same action onscreen, so a more experienced gamer can help out a novice player.
For example, Microsoft has released Super Lucky's Tale, a fun platforming game featuring a fox jumping through worlds. Playing with my kid, whose hands can barely get around the controller, I can tell them to focus on the left thumb stick, which controls movement, while I can handle the right thumb stick, which in most games controls the camera. The mode is also good to occasionally save them from certain video game death.
Sony gets phone-y
The complexity of controllers is absolutely a big barrier for new gamers, young and old, which might explain why Sony has announced a mini-wired gamepad for PS4, available this holiday season, to help bring younger players to the party.
Sony has also introduced a new series of games under the PlayLink banner, which use smartphones as controllers. The games are generally cheaper than hardcore games, require you to download apps onto the phones, and offer more group friendly experiences. There's SingStar Celebration, a karaoke-type of game. Knowledge is Power is a trivia game with cute characters that represent players. That's You is a similar question/answer type game, but the queries are focused on the people in the room. There is also Hidden Agenda, a hide and seek puzzler, and Frantics, a silly minigame collection coming next year. With a group of friends or family, these games can be a blast.
For the music maestros
Smart speakers are going to be one of the hottest holiday gifts, with Google Home speakers going on sale in anticipation of Amazon Alexa's recent arrival in Canada. Don't expect amazing results out of either of them — they are about as good as the assistant on your phone for most queries.
But both of these speakers offer some games and activities for kids. Alexa has “skills,” the name for activities it can do, while Google Home has 50 activities and minigames for youngsters, although the majority have yet to make their way to Canada. One that is here is a Mickey Mouse choose-your-adventure type game, where they tell a story and the young listener is expected to respond. It's fun, although after my daughter played through it once, they started talking incessantly to me again — so was it really that effective?
