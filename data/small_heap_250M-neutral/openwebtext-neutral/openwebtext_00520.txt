PJ Hairston does not learn. After having no charges placed on them following their arrest for possession of marijuana, they were charged on Sunday for speeding reckless driving reports the USA Today. Hairston was pulled over for going 93 in a 65 MPH zone.
This is the latest in a series of incidents that the young UNC forward has found themselves in this summer. One might think that after an arrest scare, Hairston would try to stay on the down low for a little bit, but that apparently is not how PJ Hairston likes to roll.
At the time they were pulled over, they were driving a 2008 Acura LT, no word on if they owned the vehicle or if it was a rental somehow related to Haydn Thomas again. Thomas was the owner of the rental that Hairston was pulled over for their marijuana arrest. The court date for Hairston's citation is August 30th.
As if their day could not get any worse, news also came out today that UNC was suspending Hairston indefinitely. The Tar Heels coach Roy Williams was the one to make the decision on the suspension. News is scarce on the situation as it is currently breaking but we will keep you up to date as the situation goes along.

Rachel Maddow goes through some of the dirty tricks we've already seen happening in various locations across the country and empowers us all to not let anyone steal your vote.
After eight years of perhaps the most incompetent government in American history, we‘ve got one way to fix it now, one way to exchange a president who is more despised by their own people than any other president in the time that polls existed. Choose who you will, but do not give up the power to choose by letting anyone or anything stop you from voting.
Transcripts below the fold
There is bad news and good news this election eve. The bad news, there‘s a crime wave going on. People are trying to steal from you as we speak - steal, rob, burgle, pilfer, abscond. That is the bad news. The good news? Unlike most arch-criminals, these thieves can be stopped if you just ignore them. Can you imagine if Batman could have ignored the Joker? Holy simple solution.
Well, what treasure do these thugs want from you? They want your vote. They want your power. Anyone who tells you, you can vote by phone in this election is lying and trying to steal your vote. You cannot cast your vote by phone. Anyone tells you, you are risking arrest or traffic tickets or outstanding warrants by turning up and voting tomorrow, they are lying to you and trying to steal your vote. You will not be arrested at your polling place.
Anyone who tells that you are expected to show up to vote on Wednesday instead of on Tuesday because of high expected turnout or something, they are lying to you and they are trying to steal your vote. The last day to vote is tomorrow, Tuesday.
If anyone threatens your college financial aid or tells you your parents will not be able to claim you as a dependent on their taxes anymore, if you vote where your college is instead of where your parents live, say it with me now, they are lying to you and are trying to steal your vote. The Supreme Court has affirmed that college students have the right to vote where they go to school.
Now, in an ideal world, candidates would each try to persuade the largest possible number of Americans that they‘d be the better elected official. And that‘s how elections would go. Who ever persuaded more Americans to their side would win.
In the real world, there‘s a whole lot of hullabaloo and holy-baloney that gets in between us deciding who we want to vote for and our votes actually getting cast and counted.
First, it‘s the voter registration purges. With election officials looking to produce the smallest possible roster of eligible voters, kicking people off the voter rolls for squinting in their ID photo or whatever.
Then, it‘s the allocation of voting machines and poll workers and the restricted polling place hours to ensure that you have to be able to afford to wait in line a really, really, really long time if you want the privilege - I mean, the right of casting that precious ballot.
Then it‘s these last-minute dirty tricks that fall somewhere between mob tactics and the kind of prank calls that Bart Simpson makes to Moe‘s bar, “Is Mr. Kaholic there? Al Kaholic?”
Voters in Virginia have been getting these flyers with the seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia on them, the letterhead of the Virginia State Board of Elections. And they tell them that if they‘re planning on voting for a Democratic candidate, they should show up the day after Election Day.
Robo calls in the Pittsburgh area are telling voters the same thing. Voters in Broward County, Florida have been getting calls that sound like they‘re from the county election supervisor inviting them to vote by phone instead of at the polling place. Same thing in Nevada, where Latino voters are being targeted with the same vote by phone scam.
At Drexel University in Philly, flyers warning students that voting would cause them to risk arrest at the polling place.
Here‘s what I think about this anti-democratic, “steal your vote, screw the heroes who died for this right,” underhanded, cowardly, sniveling, illegally intimidating and misleading, unpatriotic, anti-American, bull pucky. I‘m not crazy about it.
And since it‘s illegal, and since it happens to a greater or lesser degree in every election now, it would be nice to see this stuff get prosecuted every once in a while.
In the meantime, we can all fight back by not being intimidated, not getting tired, not letting the obstacle course they are making you run through keep you from exercising your right as an American to participate in this big group decision we call democracy.
After eight years of perhaps the most incompetent government in American history, we‘ve got one way to fix it now, one way to exchange a president who is more despised by their own people than any other president in the time that polls existed. Choose who you will, but do not give up the power to choose by letting anyone or anything stop you from voting.
Iran's oil and gas sector remains critical to the country's economic prospects. Its future depends not only on whether, and how quickly, sanctions are removed, but also on the terms that Iran is prepared to offer to the international oil companies (IOCs). Latterly, the low oil-price environment may mean that the sector's appeal to investors is diminished, even if sanctions are revoked.
Iran has struggled to attract investors. In the 1990s attempts to secure international investment were ineffective because of the unfavourable terms on offer to IOCs and the operational problems that arose as the sector became increasingly politicized and less well organized.
The current administration under President Hassan Rouhani is echoing opinions from that era on the need to increase the involvement of the private sector in the economy, although it is unclear how seriously such statements should be taken. Iran is in severe need of the technology and capital that would be available from IOCs for its oil and gas sector. Yet, while there has been much hype from the Iranian side about the high level of interest, the IOCs are only likely to be interested if the terms are advantageous.
London's fast-expanding green bus fleet is to receive a further boost, after Transport for London (TfL) announced on Wednesday the launch of a new trial to test four specially designed hybrid buses capable of wirelessly charging their batteries at bus stops.
The Alexander Dennis Enviro400H E400 buses feature a diesel-electric hybrid engine and have been fitted with technology that will enable to batteries to receive a charging boost when stationary at specially equipped bus stops.
Four buses will operate from next year on the Stagecoach-operated route 69 between Canning Town and Walthamstow bus stations, both of which will be fitted with inductive wireless charging technology.
TfL didn't disclose the projected carbon emission, air pollution, and fuel cost savings expected from the trial, but said the technology will allow the buses to operate in pure electric mode for “a significant period of the time they are in passenger service”.
“The buses have a diesel engine that will be used when the battery power on the bus is depleted, but it is anticipated this will only be a small amount of the time, meaning emissions on these vehicles are greatly reduced,” TfL said.
The trial is being part-funded by the Zero Emissions Urban Bus System (Zeeus) and represents the latest green bus pilot scheme to be undertaken by TfL, following the launch of a fleet of six pure electric buses, the introduction of zero-emission hydrogen buses on Route RV1 between Covent Garden and Tower Gateway, and the rollout of about 800 hybrid buses.
“We are continuing our assessment of new technology in the capital that can deliver genuine environmental benefits,” said Mike Weston, TfL's director of buses, in a statement. “This trial of extended-range diesel-electric hybrid buses, utilising the latest inductive charging technology, could be a step closer to getting even cleaner double-deck buses on London's streets. We will be closely monitoring the results of the trials, which may help us adopt this new cleaner technology more widely in London.”
The development comes in the same week as thinktank IPPR published a new report arguing that the failure of other cities to emulate TfL's co-ordinated, city-wide approach to public transport provision had led to higher fares, poor bus services, and increased environmental impacts.
The study looked at the liberalisation of bus provision in the UK and revealed how bus use outside London fell more than 32% since 1986, while rising 99% over the same period in the capital. In addition, English bus fares outside London rose by 35% above inflation between 1995 and 2013, while 37% of weekly bus services outside London face no competition.
“London has the best buses in Britain and that's no accident,” said IPPR associate director Will Straw. “Transport for London has been a great success while the deregulation of buses outside London has largely failed. Outside London, bus passenger journeys are down and fares are rising higher than inflation. Examples of successful bus markets outside London are all too rare so local transport bodies should be given greater powers to hold uncompetitive providers to account.”
Image copyright AFP Image caption Police say they have confirmed the identity of Mr Osaka through DNA tests
For one suspected murderer in Japan, it has been a case of being able to run but not being able to hide.
Left-wing revolutionary Masaaki Osaka has been arrested and charged for murdering a police officer during Tokyo street protests more than 45 years ago.
They allegedly set the officer on fire using a Molotov Cocktail petrol bomb.
No other suspected criminal has spent longer evading arrest, Japanese media report. The country has no statute of limitations for murder.
The 15-year time limit was abolished in 2010.
Where do prison escapees and absconders actually go?
Mr Osaka was arrested last month in a Hiroshima apartment belonging to the Chukaku-ha, or the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (JRCL).  They are reported by police to have remained silent since being caught.

The fugitive was initially accused of a separate offence - obstructing the police - before officers claim to have realised who they are.
On Wednesday, they were transported from Hiroshima to Tokyo for further questioning, local media reported.
Police say they have confirmed their identity through DNA tests because fingerprints were unavailable at the time of the crime.
They say Mr Osaka was able to remain on the run for so long because they are a former high-ranking member of the radical left-wing JRCL and was assisted by sympathetic party associates.
Image copyright EPA Image caption The fugitive has appeared on wanted posters throughout the last four decades
The JRCL was established in the late 1950s and during the 1960s and 1970s earned a reputation for staging violent street protests.
Mr Osaka is accused of killing the 21-year-old police officer during a left wing riot in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward in 1971.  They are alleged to have assaulted them with a steel pipe before setting them alight.
The JRCL was protesting - among other things - against the recognition by Japan of the US military presence in the country.
The man alleged to be Mr Osaka's accomplice in the 1971 attack was charged in 1972, but their case was suspended because of mental illness.

As the Browns lay the foundation for their next run at a franchise quarterback, they'll be reminded on Sunday of one who got away.
In 2005, the Browns held the third overall pick in the draft. They expressed interest in Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers; they drafted receiver Braylon Edwards. (Two rounds later, Cleveland drafted quarterback Charlie Frye.)
“Yeah I was out at the facility actually,” Rodgers said, via Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. “I remember meeting with Romeo Crennel, who was the coach at the time. I enjoyed our conversation. Trent Dilfer, who was a buddy of mine, was the quarterback there at the time. I thought it was a strong possibility being there. I enjoyed my visit there. It was my first of two visits where I actually went to the team facility.
“That was really exciting for me as a young player, to go out there and stay in the hotel and go in the facility and eat at the team dining [hall]. I thought that was really a big deal. I enjoyed it a lot. They went in a different direction. The rest is history.”
Yes it is. The Browns have continued to search in vain for a franchise quarterback, using a first-round pick seven years later on Brandon Weeden, who is actually older than Rodgers.
Eleven other quarterbacks have started for the Browns in the years since G.M. Phil Savage passed on Rodgers. If Weeden holds the job for the rest of the years, the Browns surely will hope that, come next season, starter No. 13 will be the one that finally changes Cleveland's luck.
Microsoft Flight Simulator is making a comeback — but Microsoft won't be doing any of the work to make it happen.
Dovetail Games, makers of the Train Simulator franchise, has signed a global licensing deal with Microsoft for Flight Simulator and plans on releasing a new game in 2015 based on Microsoft's popular flight sim.
In addition, UK-based Dovetail Games will also re-distribute the popular Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition — the final installment of the Flight Simulator series released eight years ago — on Valve's Steam digital distribution platform later this year.
“I am delighted to be working in partnership with Microsoft as part of this agreement,” Dovetail Games CEO Paul Jackson said in a statement. “We are thrilled to be exploring new flight simulation opportunities using Microsoft's technology, and look forward to using our extensive expertise of Steam publishing to successfully bring Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition to a broad new audience on the Steam platform.”
Kevin Perry, an executive producer at Microsoft, called Dovetail Games the “obvious choice for us to work with.”
“We respect their approach in terms of delivering premium quality simulation games and look forward to seeing their vision of the next chapter in flight simulations unfold,” Perry said in a statement.
Microsoft Flight Simulator was one of the most popular and well-known franchises for the PC, but was discontinued in 2009. In 2012, Microsoft developed a free-to-play follow-up title called Microsoft Flight, but the game didn't catch on with a wide audience and was shut down within six months after launch.
Flight, which will end support for its multiplayer servers later this year, was criticized heavily by fans of Microsoft Flight Simulator, which said it fell short of a true simulation and didn't live up to the legacy of Flight Sim.
Why are sex worker rights important to you?
Obviously a good amount of it is self-interest. My job is hard enough without the stigma and criminalization, and I know I deserve better. But I'm not the one hit the hardest by whorephobia. I'm white, cis, from a middle-class background, work indoors, and don't do full-service. I'm not the one usually targeted by police and rescue orgs and serial killers. Sex work, as an underground economy, attracts a lot of the most vulnerable from every marginalized group, and I am very much here for them as well.
What legislation do you think would be best to ensure sex workers have all the same rights as all other citizens?
I'm not particularly in favor of any legislation at this point. I think sex work should be fully decriminalized. If the state does need to be involved, it should regulate sex work via civil ordinances rather than criminal law. I used to be in favor of hate crimes legislation that protects sex workers, but the more I learn about the prison industrial complex in the U.S., the more wary I am of giving the state more opportunities to disproportionately incarcerate poor people of color.
Experiences of selling sex, like mine, that are not positive are often used by those seeking to end prostitution in their argument for the Swedish model. I believe they show why decriminalisation is needed. What are your thoughts on this?
I understand that it's easy for many sex workers to be reactionary and push back against partial criminalization (e.g. the Swedish model) by countering the assertion that they're victims who hate their jobs. I'm sure it's incredibly frustrating to hear you hate your job when you don't, and I'd never tell anyone not to speak their truth. But making it about feelings allows the conversation to be derailed. How workers feel about our jobs is irrelevant to the basic human right to safe working conditions, and it's been proven that partial criminalization is anathema to safety. The “give me rights, because I love my job” argument is nonsensical within this framework.
It's also alienating workers who don't like their (our? I still struggle with how I feel about my job) work, who need rights most urgently. When a sex worker is independent and in control of how they work, it's easier for them to love their job. However, if she's a full-service street worker trying to negotiate under criminalization or a pro sub working for a house with a no-blacklist policy or a stripper dancing in a club with outrageous fines or a porn performer shooting for a company that doesn't pay fair wages, it's harder for them to stand up and say “I love my job!” But workers like that are crucial to the sex worker movement; they show everyone where we need to focus our energy. They (we?) also provide the strongest testimonies for workers' rights.
Do you think because those experiences are used by those seeking to abolish prostitution, people who have had or do have a negative experience are not heard as often in sex worker rights discourse?
This is sort of a chicken-and-egg question. Is it negative experiences being used by Antis that prevents sex worker advocates from embracing those same experiences, or is it that sex worker advocates didn't embrace those negative experiences and so pushed the women who had them to side with the Antis? I don't know, and I'm not sure it matters at this point. What matters is that sex workers with negative experiences are indeed more openly welcomed by Antis, even though they're only valued in a tokenizing way. The mainstream sex workers' rights movement needs to make more of an effort embrace those experiences, to show that ALL workers are welcome. I do think there are significant strides being made to that extent, but a lot of it is still lip service.
To people who believe the Swedish model will help those with negative experiences in the sex trade, what would you say?
You can argue all day over whether the sex industry is harmful to women as a whole and workers in particular, but you can't argue with the studies that show the Swedish model allows violence against sex workers to continue. You also can't argue the fact that, were it to succeed, sex workers would simply find themselves unemployed. So clients may be ‘punished', but the workers will be punished as well. If you want to help those in the sex trades who don't want to be there, provide more options. Provide alternatives. Don't just take this one option away.

MASON CITY, Iowa -- On Dec. 29, The Huffington Post sat down with presidential candidate Mitt Romney for a one-on-one interview on board their campaign bus as it left a stop here in northern Iowa. Below is the transcript of our discussion.
HP: So you are officially all in in Iowa, you know, with your campaign.
Romney: Right.
HP: Democrats, however, are trying to play up that comment you made about if you finish behind Ron Paul, it's not a win, because you said, "Uh, no." So they're saying, "OK, if they don't win Iowa now, it's not a victory."
Romney: If Ron Paul wins Iowa, Ron Paul will have won Iowa. I will not have won Iowa. Now, what that means down the road is a different matter.
HP: What does that mean?
Romney: Well, we have 1,150 delegates to get. This is a long process of getting those delegates. I'd love to get a good send-off from Iowa, and I hope to get that good send-off.
HP: So if you finish behind Paul and it's a strong second, that's a win for you?
Romney: You know, I'm going to let you guys figure that out. What I do is I go out and tell people my message and hopefully get good support. But where you place in the 1, 2, 3, 4 is far less important to me than whether you get 1,150 delegates. And I believe we have a message and a course to get that done.
HP: Any PTSD from four years ago?
Romney: Actually the opposite. The experience of four years ago makes me recognize that this is very much out of my control and unpredictable, and you say what you believe and you look at the results and then you go on to the next contest.
HP: So Governor [Rick] Perry -- I was with them last week -- they made a comment that I found intriguing. I haven't heard you respond to this. They said, "Romney is part of Wall Street" because of your work on private equity. Is private equity part of Wall Street in your opinion?
Romney: You know, I'm not going to be the technical divider of what's Wall Street or not. Wall Street is typically thought of as investment banking and banking, and we were not an investment bank or a bank. But we were in the financial services sector generally. I am not a Wall Street guy, classically defined, but I am not going to quibble over definitions. I can tell you that I have run four different enterprises in my life. One was a consulting firm, one was a private equity and venture capital firm, one was an Olympics, and the other was a state. And my track record in those places speaks for itself.
HP: Is there any way you'd ever disclose investors in Bain [Capital] to put to rest people who want to say all the money came from Wall Street? Because you've said some of it came from pension funds and all these sorts of things.
Romney: I don't know that the Bain people would disclose their investors. I'm just trying to think back to the funds when I was there. I don't believe any of the funding came from Wall Street, meaning from investment banks or the like. Our funding came from individuals, and then ultimately we got funding from a church pension fund, endowments -- I think our largest single investor group were endowments from colleges. And then we used those funds to either start businesses, venture capital, or to try and buy businesses in trouble and make them stronger. That's not technically Wall Street, that's not an investment banking function, but it is financial services.
HP: Do you agree with Jon Huntsman's proposal, or disagree, to break up the big banks to keep them from becoming too big to fail?
Romney: I don't believe in the concept of "too big to fail." I believe that institutions have the capacity to go through bankruptcy if necessary to reorganize their obligations. I think what happened in 2008 was not a matter of one bank, Lehman Brothers, having caused the entire collapse. I think the matter was that we had a massive problem in our economy, which was precipitated by the subprime mortgage crisis, that threatened not just one or two banks but threatened the entire banking sector, our entire financial services sector. And that was a setting very different than that that would be caused by one institution getting in trouble.
HP: President Obama -- what's the most tone-deaf thing you've heard them say recently?
Romney: "It could be worse." When the president's characterization of our economy was "it could be worse," it reminded me of Marie Antoinette: "Let them eat cake." This is not a time to be talking about "it could be worse." This is a time to recognize that things should be better. And the president's policies have failed the American people, have led to 25 million people still being out of work. They didn't cause the recession, but they have made it deeper and has made the recovery more tepid and the pain last longer.
HP: Unemployment is at 8.6 percent. That's actually the lowest since their third month in office. What do you think it'll be -- roughly speaking, just from the general trends you see -- next fall? And if it's a continued downward trend line, even if it's three or four points, does that complicate your ability to make your point about the economy?
Romney: This has been already the worst recovery since Hoover. And they may say it's kept getting better and try to take credit for the fact that the economy recovered, but the economy will always recover. We've never gone into permanent recession or depression. The economy will come back after recession. The question is, "Did they help it or hurt it?" Did they prolong the pain, or did they reduce the pain? And the truth is they made things harder to recover. They made more people suffer longer. And I will point out that their policies have not helped America get back on track or helped Americans get jobs again.
HP: You don't like prognostications, I can tell.
Romney: [laughing] If I could predict what the unemployment rate was going to be a year from now, you know, I could demand the world.
HP: You've come under some criticism for the capital gains rate that you've gotten some of your income at. Is that a special break when people who are wealthy get income taxed at that lower rate because it's an investment? Because you've said, you know, you don't want special breaks for people who are wealthy.
Romney: And I think that's right. You take advantage of the opportunity to be in America, to build a bright future, and you pay your taxes as required by law. And if something is a capital gain, it should be treated as a capital gain. If something is ordinary income, it should be treated as ordinary income. And the determination of those things has been made by Congress and by the courts and by the Internal Revenue Service. I've always followed the law as to the taxes that we've paid, my wife and I have paid. And we can talk about how to make the tax code better going forward. My own view is that the people who are well-off are doing quite well and don't need help, in terms of tax help, tax relief help. The people who are poor have a safety net that helps care for them and needs to be mended from time to time. But it's the people who are in the middle class who are in trouble. And that's why my proposal on taxation is to eliminate the tax on capital gains, interest and dividends for middle-income Americans, not for high-income Americans.
HP: On immigration, do you buy the line, the argument -- Ed Gillespie, who's a major strategist in the [Republican P]arty, feels this way -- that a hard line against immigration is bad for the party or even dangerous for the party's prospects in the future with Hispanics?
Romney: I think we have to be very clear with the American people that we will enforce our laws and secure our border, and at the same time we welcome legal immigration, and we want to prevent illegal immigration in part to protect and, in my view, expand the benefits of legal immigration.
HP: But you've been very strong about people needing to go home no matter how long they've been here. Is that kind of thing going to hurt the Republican Party's standing with Hispanics?
Romney: What I indicate is that there should be a transition period where people are able to transition to ultimately returning home and being in line and applying for the right to come back to this country. But I don't think people who come here illegally should get a special privilege relative to those who have been waiting in line legally.
HP: But what about the party's relationship with Hispanics? I mean, that's important. They're a big part of this country and growing.
Romney: No question. And I believe that Hispanic voters, like other voters in this country, are in America because it's the land of opportunity. And I believe that my party and my positions on issues will demonstrate that I'll keep America the land of opportunity, and the president is turning it into something they wouldn't recognize.
HP: All right, I have two more questions. In your book, you mention the electromagnetic pulse. This is just kind of an oddball question: Why is it in your book? Do you think that's actually a serious thing?
Romney: I think threats and attacks that are beyond our current thinking and conventional consideration have to be envisioned by military planners. I think cybersecurity is well behind where we should be at this stage. I think cyber warfare is also well behind where we could be. The possibility of other technologies interfering with our capacity to defend ourselves and maintain an economy -- such as the EMP threat -- have to be considered and protected against. It's one reason why I think a missile defense system is an appropriate and valid investment for the country.
HP: Lastly, George Bush was asked -- they were very public about their faith -- they were asked from time to time, "What do you do to keep yourself spiritually grounded and centered on a daily routine sort of thing?" And they would talk about reading the Bible and praying on a regular basis. What do you do -- anything like that, similarly on a daily basis -- to keep yourself centered, whether it's reading or prayer or anything like that?
Romney: Let's see, how would I describe this? Let's see. I read Scripture regularly and seek the counsel of my creator on a daily basis.
HP: Now why did you have to think about how to describe that?
Romney: No particular reason.
HP: And that's every day or most every day?
Romney: You know, I pray every day. I don't read Scriptures every day. Probably should.
[His wife, Ann Romney, holds up an iPad.]
Mitt: There we go, just did. I've got them on my iPad. I should probably read Scripture every day, but I read them frequently. But not every day.
Ann: Sometimes I read to them if we're on the phone. I will read them chapters.
Mitt: But I go to church every Sunday.
HP: Do you really?

The review paper is a staple of medical literature and, when well executed by an expert in the field, can provide a summary of literature that generates useful recommendations and new conceptualizations of a topic. However, if research results are selectively chosen, a review has the potential to create a convincing argument for a faulty hypothesis. Improper correlation or extrapolation of data can result in dangerously flawed conclusions. The following paper seeks to illustrate this point, using existing research to argue the hypothesis that cigarette smoking enhances endurance performance and should be incorporated into high-level training programs.
While athletes endanger their careers and well-being in attempts to gain small benefits with illicit or inconvenient practices, a legal, nonprescription alternative has been largely ignored by athletes, coaches and exercise physiologists alike. Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase serum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increase lung volume and stimulate weight loss — characteristics all known to enhance performance in endurance sports. This paper will discuss the potential benefits of cigarette smoking to endurance performance and make recommendations as to how individuals and national bodies could effectively integrate this practice into high-performance training programs.
Altitude training has also become common among endurance athletes, because it has been associated with an increase in performance and in serum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. However, this response is transient — the physiologic variables return to their baseline soon after the athlete returns to sea level. 2 This moderate performance benefit is outweighed by several severe and life-threatening risks, including pulmonary edema, 3 cerebral edema 4 and severe flatulence. 5
Performances in endurance sports have been shrouded in controversy for the past 30 years because many athletes, intent on winning races and achieving faster times, have turned to banned performance-enhancing drugs. The World Anti-Doping Agency's 2009 list of prohibited substances and methods includes erythropoietin, other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and various methods designed to enhance oxygen transfer. 1 The effects of these agents and methods are thought to be primarily beneficial in endurance sports such as distance running and cycling. Despite the prohibition, the use of these drugs and techniques persists, as evidenced by continued positive results of drug tests in and out of competition.
Lower body weight is desirable in weight-bearing endurance sports, with distance running being the most obvious example. Cigarette smoking has been shown to stimulate weight loss through a variety of mechanisms including increased metabolic demand and appetite suppression. Hunger is suppressed via nicotine, the primary active ingredient in cigarettes. 16 This could potentially be of great benefit to endurance athletes, because evidence suggests that exercise can increase appetite, putting athletes at greater risk for weight gain. 17 Weight loss may be further enhanced in people who smoke cigarettes and go on to develop COPD. These people require more energy to breathe at rest and thus have increased resting energy requirements, often not balanced by caloric intake. 18
Although lung volume measurement is not often used to determine endurance performance, increased total lung capacity has been shown to correlate with endurance training. Both swimming and long-distance running training result in increased total lung capacity. 11 – 13 Results from other studies show that the same benefits can be derived from cigarette smoking as part of a syndrome known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 14 , 15 These changes are not universal in smoking, however. Even with lifetime smoking, there is only a 50% chance of developing COPD.
In contrast, cigarette smoking has been associated with persistent increases in hemoglobin. Smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day is associated with an average hemoglobin increase of 3.5% compared with nonsmoking controls, a change which can be maintained simply by continuing the treatment regimen. 10 In fact, older people with longer smoking histories have higher hemoglobin levels, indicating a possible dose-dependent effect. 10 The hemoglobin increases may be further enhanced with add-on therapy of ethanol, which also appears to act in a dose-dependent manner. 10
Blood hemoglobin concentration has been clearly associated with endurance performance and convincingly correlated with oxygen-carrying capacity. Decreased hemoglobin levels are associated with decreased maximal oxygen uptake and submaximal exercise capacity. 6 Athletes have attempted to increase hemoglobin levels through blood doping, use of exogenous hormones and altitude training (real or simulated). 7 These techniques are mostly illegal, and even altitude training has substantial health risks with physiologic benefits that are relatively modest and transient. Erythropoietin increases during the first 24–48 hours of altitude training, but levels normalize by one week. 8 Although a three-week training stint at altitude results in a 7%–10% increase in hemoglobin, 7 , 9 Heinicke and colleagues showed that levels return to normal within two weeks. 9
Discussion
Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase serum hemoglobin, increase total lung capacity and stimulate weight loss, factors that all contribute to enhanced performance in endurance sports. Despite this scientific evidence, the prevalence of smoking in elite athletes is actually many times lower than in the general population.19 The reasons for this are unclear; however, there has been little to no effort made on the part of national governing bodies to encourage smoking among athletes.
One important aspect of the benefits of smoking is they appear to be dose-dependent and may not develop until many years after initiation of treatment. With this in mind, smoking should be commenced at as young an age as is reasonably possible. Children who have not yet developed a pincer grasp might require modified cigarette holders, safety lighters or both. These points are moot at this time, because such initiatives are not possible in many countries because of existing legislation putting age restrictions on the purchase of cigarettes. For example, the minimum age to buy cigarettes in Canada is 18 years.19
Although laws to restrict tobacco sales have existed in developed countries for some time, developing countries have only recently begun to pass similar legislation.20 These latter countries have had much more success in endurance events in recent years, but research has not yet been conducted to investigate the prevalence of smoking among their top athletes and whether treatment was begun in childhood. More globally universal age restrictions may even the playing field with respect to endurance performance. However, countries should strongly consider repealing the existing laws or at least allowing exemptions for people thought to have athletic potential in endurance sports.
In summary, existing literature supports the use of cigarettes to enhance endurance performance through weight loss and increased serum hemoglobin levels and lung volumes. However, athletes continue to neglect smoking and pursue illegal and dangerous methods that have only minor and transient effects on the same physiologic variables. More research is needed to clearly delineate when and how cigarette smoking should be integrated into high-performance training programs. Despite substantial federal financial support for endurance athlete development, we are aware of no such research programs at present.
HAGERSTOWN, Md. - The trucking industry scored a victory this week when Republican lawmakers effectively blocked Obama administration safety rules aimed at keeping tired truckers off the highway. But there's more coming down the road.
The American Trucking Associations is pledging to come back next month, when Republicans will control the White House and Congress, and try to block state laws that require additional rest breaks for truckers beyond what federal rules require. The group says there should be one uniform national rule on work hours for interstate truckers.
Feds propose speed limiting devices on trucks and buses
The trucking industry's latest triumph has caused concern among safety advocates that it may signal the start of a broad rollback of transportation safety regulations once there's no longer a Democratic president to check the tendency of Republican lawmakers to side with industry.
“Unfortunately, it's going to be an open season on safety in this coming Congress,” said Jim Hall, chairperson of the National Transportation Safety Board during the Clinton administration.
Shippers and some segments of the trucking industry probably will also push for long-sought goals of increasing the weight limit on trucks to more than 90,000 pounds and increasing the length of individual trailers in double-trailer combinations from 28 feet to 33 feet, safety advocates said.
“It's going to be very tough because the companies really care about the cost. They don't care about the safety no matter what they say,” said safety advocate Joan Claybrook.
The provision Republicans added to a must-pass government spending bill this week suspends regulations issued by the Obama administration requiring truckers to take two nights off to rest after a work week of up to 75 hours.
Truckers are required to take a 35-hour break after at the end of a work week. But the trucking industry objected to requirements that the 35 hours include two periods from 1 am to 5 am. Sleep scientists say rest during the early morning hours is critical for people to feel refreshed. The suspension means truckers can head out on the road again during those hours if the 35-hour break has elapsed.
Another regulation that prevents truckers from working 75 hours, followed by a 35-hour break, and then resume driving again in the same week was also suspended.
Truck driver Bill Varnado, 66, of Dallas, Georgia, said they like the sleep requirement because it ensures that drivers are well-rested. They said it's hard to find places to sleep in one's rig on the road, so drivers sometimes keep going.
“Sometimes you're forced to drive fatigued because you can't find anywhere to park,” said Varnado, who drives for Pro Trucking of Acworth, Georgia, during a truck-stop break along Interstate 81 here.
But self-employed trucker George Lafferty, 61, of Henry, Illinois, said Congress should repeal the rule.
“I don't see how the government can tell you when to sleep and when not to,” Lafferty said during a truck-stop interview along Interstate 81 after dropping off a load of yeast at a livestock-feed plant.
“A driver should know when he's fatigued or not,” they said. “If you're fatigued, take a half-hour, hour nap.”
Besides truck safety, Congress is also likely to be asked to deal with a wide range of other transportation safety concerns.
The auto and technology industries, for example, are telling Congress that they fear a “patchwork” of state safety laws will hinder the deployment of self-driving cars. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials have developed voluntary guidelines for the safe design, development, testing and deployment self-driving cars that they want automakers to follow. But California's Department of Motor Vehicles wants to make the guidelines mandatory.
Some industry officials have complained the guidelines go too far and may stifle innovation. Safety advocates say they don't go far enough.
“We think it would be completely inappropriate for Congress to pre-empt the states without strong federal safety standards in place for automated vehicles,” said William Wallace, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, the policy and mobilization arm of Consumer Reports.
“States are the ones that make the final call on whether automated vehicles should be allowed on the roads,” they said. “We think citizens of those states have the right to take action to keep their roads safe.”

On May 8, 2010 at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Canada, Mauricio “Shogun” Rua completed a journey year in the making.
Six years earlier, at the tender age of 22, Rua had taken the MMA world by storm, winning their first three fights in Pride before winning that promotion's middleweight grand prix tournament in 2005. Entering the tournament as a heavy underdog, the Brazilian tore through then-superstar Rampage Jackson in the opening round and then won a unanimous decision against Antonio Rogerio Nogueira. Two months later, Rua scored a TKO finish against Alistair Overeem and capped it off with a knockout of Ricardo Arona to win the tournament. They were 23.
This dramatic series of wins led Sherdog to rank Shogun the #1 light heavyweight in the world. Which meant by the time Rua entered the UFC in 2007, they were riding a freight train of hype.
But hype doesn't win fights, and Rua's first UFC match was a disaster. Hampered by injuries, the No. 1 light heavyweight in the world gassed out early and succumbed to the relatively unheralded Forrest Griffin by rear-naked choke late in the third round. A few knee surgeries and a couple of victories later, however, Rua was given a title shot against the newly crowned light heavyweight champion, the unbeaten Lyoto “The Dragon” Machida.”
Unlike Rashad Evans, from whom Machida had taken the title a year earlier, Shogun was an experienced striker with an arsenal of kicks. That night at the Bell Centre, Rua used those kicks to punish Machida's legs over the five rounds. They would often initiate striking exchanges with punches, using them to set up their kicks.
Although Machida started out strong, Shogun's leg kicks wore them down. The fight was a five-round war and closely contested, but in the end Shogun seemed to have solved the riddle of the elusive counter-striking Machida, employing a game plan based around relentless offense, testing the limits of the karate master's footwork and durability. When the judges declared the reigning champion the winner, even Machida seemed surprised. Rua, meanwhile, was crushed. For their trouble they were awarded a win bonus from the UFC and an immediate rematch.
Just seven months later, at UFC 113, the two met again. Machida wore a different look on their face this time, perhaps anxious at the prospect of facing a man they now knew was able to injure him. The fight started with little feeling out. Shogun sought to continue their striking assault and Machida aimed to thwart it by taking the challenger down, which they did twice in the first three minutes.
With less than two minutes to go in the first round Machida landed one of their signature jumping knees to the body. Thinking they had Shogun stunned, Machida followed up with a straight left. Shogun dodged the punch and countered with an overhand right to the champion's temple, flooring him. Shogun followed up with a few seconds of ground and pound that knocked the champion unconscious.
Almost three years after entering the UFC on a wave of promise, Shogun had finally arrived.

The names of forty-five priests and theologians who are asking for a clarification of Amoris Laetitia have been revealed.
The National Catholic Reporter has published the list of signatories to the letter, which has been sent to all 218 cardinals and patriarchs.
They include Fr Aidan Nichols, one of Britain's most distinguished theologians; the bioethicist Professor Luke Gormally, a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life; Fr Giovanni Scalese, the leader of Catholics in Afghanistan; and many other well-known names, including seminary professors and university teachers.
The letter, which has been seen by the Catholic Herald, asks the cardinals to request a clarification from the Pope that some interpretations of Amoris Laetitia are heretical.
The letter does not accuse Pope Francis of false teaching; but it says some passages can easily give rise to interpretations at odds with Catholic doctrine.
It says that a clarification would allow the “many valuable teachings” of Amoris Laetitia to “have their true effect, by distinguishing them from the problematic elements in the document and neutralising the threat to the faith posed by them.”
For instance, the letter asks for a clarification on a passage saying that someone in an “‘irregular' situation” might “be in a concrete situation which does not allow them or them to act differently and decide otherwise without further sin”.
The signatories say a heretical reading would be “that a person with full knowledge of a divine law can sin by choosing to obey that law”.
They cite the Council of Trent and other authoritative Church documents.
The spokesperson for the group, Dr Joseph Shaw, told the National Catholic Reporter: “What we're asking the cardinals to do is to request of the Holy Father that they make it clear that some interpretations are wrong.
“That what was contrary to the faith remains so, what the Council of Trent taught remains the teaching of the church.”
Dr Shaw, a member of the philosophy faculty at the University of Oxford, is one of several British signatories to the document.
Others include Fr Ray Blake, Fr Thomas Crean OP, Fr Neil Ferguson OP, Dr Alan Fimister, Fr Simon Henry, Dr Anthony McCarthy, Dr Stephen Morgan and Fr John Osman. There are also two Ordinariate priests, Fr John Hunwicke and Fr David Palmer.
Other noteworthy names include the theologian Fr Brian Harrison OS and the Australian scholar Dr Anna Silvas, who has written a thorough critique of Amoris Laetitia.
One of the signatories, Dr Alan Fimister, who teaches at St John Vianney Seminary in Colorado, told the Catholic Herald: “I am constantly approached by people citing this or that passage of Amoris Laetitia and asking how it could be reconciled with the faith as they have received it.” They said that a clarification was necessary to show what was and wasn't a legitimate interpretation.
Fimister said that when asked to add their name to the signatories, “I couldn't see how in conscience I could refuse to sign. The faith isn't a hermeneutical game whereby we find new and interesting ways to give meaning to the same words every few decades, it is the way of eternal life.”
Fimister said they had been “deeply affected” by Archbishop Samuel Aquila's article pointing out that the martyrs of the English reformation had died for the indissolubility of marriage.
Like many other observers, Archbishop Aquila argued that this teaching was threatened by proposals to admit the divorced and remarried to Communion.
Archbishop Aquila's article was entitled, “Did Thomas More and John Fisher die for nothing?” Fimister said: “As an English Catholic I feel a sacred duty to do what little I can to see that they did not.”

And now Chris Brown is beating people up on basketball courts and claiming to a Blood, allegedly. A man named Malcolm Ausbon filed a lawsuit with the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles on Thursday, February 13, describing an incident with the R&B star at an area 24-Hour Fitness. They say they called a foul on Brown, that Brown then held onto the ball in protest and threatened to “put these hands on you” while declaring their rumored allegiance to the Bloods.
The complaint then states that three members of Brown's entourage who were not in “proper workout attire” rushed him. One told him, “If you fuck with Chris, you fuck with us.” And after the game resumed, they ran back onto the court and attacked along with Brown. All four “began to strike, punch, kick, pull, and stomp Ausbon's head and body.” They then left them on the ground, according to the report, and they were shortly sent to the emergency room.
Ausbon is suing not only Brown and their alleged goons, but the gym as well, claiming both negligence and vicarious liability for the physical and emotional damage done. If deemed legitimate, the supposed injury to the plaintiff's “face, head, neck, back, legs, [and] ribs,” plus the “post traumatic stress disorder, dizziness, nervousness, embarrassment, fear, and anxiety,” will be more damage in a wake of assault cases that's getting difficult to keep track of.
For the latest rundown of Brown's legal woes, check out “Chris Brown Gets to Stay in Rehab Until HisNext Assault Hearing.”
The attacker, named as Zhu Jun, the 46-year-old head of security at a district post office, broke into a fourth-floor office at the court building in Yongzhou, Hunan province.
They had allegedly told their co-worker at the post office that they were taking the automatic weapon and two pistols for inspection by the city authorities before diverting to the courthouse.
All three judges in the office were killed while three other court staff were wounded, said a spokesperson for the local propaganda department.
According to the state media, Mr Zhu was taking revenge on the court for ruling against them in their divorce case three years ago.
Xinhua news agency said Mr Zhu lived with their parents and their son.
However, the judges who were killed on Tuesday were apparently unrelated to Mr Zhu's case and reports suggested they fired blindly.
There was no response from the courthouse, and local police said they were still investigating the case.

DRINKS companies have become braver about using whisky brands to sell spirit drinks that don't meet strict Scotch whisky rules, as the industry prepares for another year of production expansion.
Meanwhile, more marketing heft is being directed to single malts, even as blends remain dominant in the sales mix, as companies seek to establish their whiskies as luxury brands.
This is occurring against a backdrop of expansion in production with Swedish company Grythyttan turning to investors this month seeking £1 million to build a distillery on Orkney.
French spirits giant Pernod Ricard is currently shipping the first bottles of Ballantine's Brasil to target markets in Spain, France and Latin America.
The drink mixes Ballantine's whisky with lime but to meet rules about the use of the term Scotch whisky, which are enshrined in European law, the company describes it as a "spirit drink".
It is targeted at young night-time consumers who already drink Ballantine's Finest with mixers.
Earlier this year, privately owned Edrington used its Famous Grouse brand to launch Ginger Grouse, an alcoholic ginger beer "infused" with its flagship whisky, targeting the Scottish market.
The likes of Drambuie have also long used whisky in liqueur.
Paul Scanlon, commercial director at Chivas Brothers said: "We expect to see continued momentum behind flavoured whiskies and increasing interest behind craft and batch whiskies, with consumers increasingly looking for authentic products that can demonstrate strong roots, heritage and craftsmanship."
The Scotch Whisky Association said: "There is no restriction on using Scotch whisky as a base for new products. Well known Scotch whisky liqueurs have been sold for many years.
"What is essential is that the labelling and marketing of new products based on Scotch whisky make it clear for consumers that they are not Scotch whiskies.
"Ballantine's Brasil is clearly labelled as a 'spirit drink' which is the compulsory sales description if the product does not fall into the category of liqueur."
Industry figures show that single malt whisky, long overshadowed by enormous blend brands such as Diageo's Johnnie Walker and Pernod's Chivas Regal, is gaining in popularity.
In 2012, the last year for which figures are available, exports of single malt whiskies rose 4.5% to £778.1 million. Blended whiskies were up just 0.4% at £3.5bn. Exports of malts have tripled in the past decade while blends are up 75%.
Meanwhile, industry figures show that the higher-end whiskies are growing much faster than cheaper ones.
Industry figures say whisky chimes with a desire for wealthy consumers for refinement and authenticity, expressed through purchases of bespoke clothing and fine cheeses.
This distinguishes it from the conspicuous consumption that characterised the enthusiasm for many branded whiskies.
So Diageo has announced an £18m investment to develop Mortlach as a single malt brand targeted firmly at the luxury goods market. It has also rolled out several new variants of its Talisker single malt from Skye.
Pernod meanwhile, is planning to increase the promotion of Aberlour whisky beyond the French market where it has long held a leading position.
Three years ago the company increased the capacity of the Glenlivet distillery, home to its flagship single malt, by 75%.
"We expect to see the strong demand for single malt whisky to continue throughout 2014, with value growing well ahead of volume due to the relative rarity of single malts," said Mr Scanlon. "More brands will come to the fore with high quality malts like Aberlour capitalising on the market as well as the leading brands such as The Glenlivet."
Pernod's Carron malt whisky distillery on Speyside is expected to be up and running by the end of the year while Diageo has its own plans for a 13m-litre malt whisky distillery in the Highlands.
Meanwhile, smaller distilleries continue to come through.
Glenglassaugh veteran Stuart Nickerson's Shetland Distillery Company has recently sought planning permission.
Further south, on Orkney, Swedish company Grythyttan, has ambitions to establish the Longship Distillery distillery with an associated visitor centre and whisky school.
(KUTV) The city of Woods Cross now has a police dog, although not quite they are not what you might expect.This dog is a toy rat terrier, named Spot, or Spoticus as some officers call him, in an attempt to make them sound more masculine then their small frame implies.Spot weighs in at a not-so intimidating 3.3 pounds, but it's not their ability to fight crime that makes them such a valuable asset to the department."One day one of the detectives was having a really bad day after a really bad call," said Stephanie Gonzales, who works in police records. "All of a sudden, Spot ran up to them and was so excited to see them and from that point on, it was a big morale booster and we needed to keep them around."Spot is just 14 months-old, but is an actual police dog, officially registered to the Woods Cross Police Department."Woods Cross is a great department and having them here is an added bonus for us," said Officer Mike Daugherty. "He's a lot of fun to play with."The department is also looking to hire an actual patrol dog, but they say it's not in the budget right now.

Hello everyone! Welcome to our Second Kickstarter!
We are very proud to introduce our new art print project called
the O R I G I N Series!
Below we have every detail you may want to know about this project such as our Goals, Introductions, Story for this project, Rewards, Stretch Goals, and a very important section for International Backers!
The idea behind the O R I G I N Series was to create a collection of art prints that had a very unique take on the stories of how our favorite characters came to be.
Each print has it's own personality, and at it's very core each print represents the story of one character. Although all the prints may not look the same, they still fit together as a series. They were all illustrated the way we thought fit the character, and story best. The most exciting part about this series is that as we created each one, we had no idea what it was going to look like. We tried to follow the story of each character as much as possible. With each illustration, we only tell you as much as you need to know to figure out who they are, and what their story is.
The more you look at these prints, the more you will start to see. So go ahead, take a closer. We'll wait for you. Don't worry, go ahead. (...) Great, you're back! Let's keep going.
We hope that this series not only looks super sweet on your wall, and you get to enjoy them everyday, but we hope that everyone will get to learn a little bit more about the origin of these characters. We think it's important to know why, where, and how they became the people we love to read about in comics, or love to watch up on the big screen.
When we came up with the idea for the first print, the idea for 2 more came up, and soon enough we had a whole series of 20+ planned out! Although not all of them may ever see the light of day, and they are not all finished, we certainly tried to pick the best ones with the most versatile looks to make the very best looking prints! We have been working on this project for months now, thinking about all the different ways we could do a certain character's story, and how we could make each print truly different.
We think that the concept of these prints is truly unique from all the other prints out there because this collection of prints presents our favorite characters in a very personal and stylistic way. We show the struggles, and in some cases the sacrifices, some of these characters went through to become our beloved characters.
We have been so excited to show these off to the world, and now the time has finally come for the big reveal, so thank you so much for taking the time to look at our project! We truly appreciate it!
Please, read carefully below for details on rewards, and stretch goal specifications because depending on the tier that you pledge for, it depends on what kind of free print you will receive! We tried our best to give you the bang for your buck, so here it goes!
UNLOCKED - Girl Power - $8,000
When this stretch goal is reached it will unlock 2 new prints that you will be able to add to your pledge, and in some cases, depending on your pledge, you will get one of them for FREE! Plus, it unlocks a Kickstarter Exclusive print!
The ladies in this goal are strong, beautiful and just all around awesome characters! Without giving too much away *wink*, the name of the art pieces are "Amazon", and "Red Room".
In this section we have a Kickstarter Exclusive print that you will get to choose! We have the Amazon Variants*! Gold Vs. Silver. You will vote to choose which one will be available for Kickstarter Backers ONLY! That's right, you guys will vote for it, and we make it happen!

Hello International Backers! This section is here to provide you with info on shipping.
We have sent many packages/prints internationally before because of our previous Kickstarter, and through our own website as well, and we have learned a few things about sending packages outside the U.S. and here are a few things we would like for you to know.
For this project, the fees added for International Shipment are for us to be able to pay for First Class Mail postage while using United States Postal Service. First Class Mail is the most economical form of shipment (that can take up to 3-5 weeks depending on where you are). The fee also covers a little bit of added insurance for your package to make sure it can get there, because in case it does not get there (which it has happened unfortunately), we will be able to get a refund from the USPS for your package so we can send it again! We know it is not the greatest option, but it is the most affordable one. On that note, we should also let you know that we have sent plenty of packages internationally to countries like Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, England, New Zealand, and many more that arrive with no problems while using the USPS First Class Mail.
If you want your prints faster, and/or price is not a problem for you, there are other opetions. We can use vendors like FedEx, or UPS to get your shipment to you. Please, let us know if you would like to upgrade your shipping and we can give you an estimate of how much more it would cost to send your package.
We apologize for this inconvenience. Please, be aware that we have absolutely NO influence in shipping prices, and arrival times. We do our best to send your package as soon as possible to you, while using the safest, and most economical way because who doesn't love to save a few bucks? If you have any other questions, please let us know by sending us a message through Kickstarter, or e-mail us at hi@theninjabot.com. Thank you so much!
Here are a few extra important details for you to know before you go pledge for your favorite print!
Your money is going towards the cost of the high quality printing of all of our products. It will also cover the cost of all the packaging materials to properly send all of these products to you as safely as possible, and it's postage.

The Oculus Rift and HTC Vive can transport you to a whole new world, but first you've got to get the headsets on. If you wear glasses, that might be easier said than done.
I tested the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive on myself and several other CNET staffers who wear glasses and found that for the most part, you can make the headset work. Here are a few tips for wearing the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive with glasses.
Measure before you buy
Unfortunately, your glasses will either fit into the display or not. The good news is that most glasses we tested, both large and small frames, both headsets fit over them just fine. The bad news is there's no way to adjust the width or height of the display part of either the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive to accommodate extra-large frames.
James Martin/CNET
Before you shell out a few hundred bucks for a VR headset measure your glasses to make sure they'll fit inside. For the best results, measure the length and height of your frames, plus how far they extend out from where they meet your face. Compare those numbers to the measurements of the insides of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.
Oculus Rift: 6 inches (152mm) wide, 2.5 inches (63.5mm) tall, and 2 inches (50.8mm) at the deepest spot from the lens to the edge of the face padding.
HTC Vive: 6 inches wide, 2 inches tall and can go up to just over 2 inches deep at edge of padding (152 by 50 by about 51mm).
Get the right fit
When you first put the headset on, adjust all of the straps to the loosest setting. Put the headset on front to back, so that you fit the front display around your glasses, then gently tug the back strap and slide it over the back of your head.
Adjust the side straps so that the display fits snug around your face, but isn't digging into your glasses or face. Your glasses will may wedge themselves into the foam padding, which is OK and will help keep them in place while you wear the headset.
James Martin/CNET
With the HTC Vive, you can adjust the lens depth to give your glasses a bit more room; many glasses-wearers who tried it out found this was more comfortable than the Rift. The Vive also comes with a smaller face pad that gives you a bit more space for glasses.
Always front to back
Make sure your glasses fit into the headset first when putting on either headset so they don't get smashed. Always put it on front to back, then take it off in reverse (which is different from how you'd put on the headset if you don't wear glasses). Your glasses may get stuck in the foam padding when you take the headset off, but they'll come out easily.
My experience in decision-making has shown that patterns are tough to break. In the military we study an opponent looking for gaps, flaws, or weaknesses that can be exploited. Successful leaders at all levels in all disciplines conduct this kind of analysis.
It is quite clear, using that kind of analysis, that Hillary Clinton can best be described as an architect of failure when it comes to national security and international relations. The potential consequences of their flawed decision-making would be destructive to the nation if they were commander in chief.
The second presidential debate made that assessment even clearer when, in an exchange on Syria, Clinton denied being secretary of state when President Obama drew their red line against Syrian use of chemical weapons against civilians. Clinton's continued obfuscation, deception and shading of the truth went beyond the pale. "I was gone," they claimed. No, Madam Secretary, you were not gone. You were responsible for our government's foreign relations during that time.
Let's briefly review their qualifications to be commander in chief and focus on key international decisions considered to be, by their supporters, a strength. Clinton's policy decisions have affected thousands: decisions that resulted in the loss of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines; decisions that have cost this country trillions of dollars; decisions that have destabilized the Middle East and decisions that demonstrate their decision-making quality (a quality that is sadly lacking).
Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton was a sitting United States senator who voted for the war in Iraq. By that vote in 2003, they bear some responsibility for our involvement. Later, when the war was at a tipping point in 2007 and General David Petraeus advocated for a surge of U.S. forces to regain lost momentum, they voted against it.
As secretary of state they failed to negotiate a residual force that would have prevented Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki from creating sectarian strife. The ensuing strife led to the creation of an irregular war between Sunni and Shia with the Islamic State growing from that turmoil.
Each decision point was a critical event in U.S.-Iraq relations, and each a significant failure. Each have Clinton's fingerprints on them. The latter two clearly demonstrate arrogance and a a disdain for military recommendations.
Clinton considers the 2011 overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya to be one of their finest hours as secretary of state. President Obama considers it one of their worst failures. As secretary of state, they pushed for U.S. and NATO involvement against Gaddafi. When they were overthrown, there was no plan for follow-up governance. The result was instability, a huge refugee flow into southern Europe and the Islamic State gaining a foothold in Libya.
Worse was the eventual loss of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens in the Benghazi terrorist attack. It was the first killing of a U.S. ambassador in the line of duty since 1979. The response from our secretary of state? They claimed their killing was the result of an anti-Islamic video.
As secretary of state they proudly pushed the "reset" button on U.S.-Russia relations with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2009. They couldn't even get the translation on the button correct: The Russian word emblazoned on the button actually meant "overload."
How prescient. The ensuing result was Cold War 2.0. After their reset, Russia took Crimea, invaded Ukraine, strongly supported Syrian President Bashar Assad, conducted airstrikes against civilians in Aleppo, Syria and significantly increased their military and political presence in the Middle East.
In Syria, while secretary of state, Clinton watched as United Nations resolution after U.N. resolution failed. They accomplished nothing except to repeat the refrain "Assad must go." They said in 2012 that opposition to Assad was the first step towards a better future for the people of Syria.
Tell that to the 500,000 Syrian dead or the 3 million refugees. When Obama drew a red line in 2012 against chemical weapons-use against civilians, Clinton stood by and did nothing as the Syrian regime used sarin nerve gas against civilians.
In 2009, Clinton called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and their wife "friends of the family." Some friends. In January of 2011 they were gone, overthrown by an Arab Spring uprising Clinton openly supported. Even greater turmoil followed under the Muslim Brotherhood until a popular uprising resulted in their overthrow.
The new, popularly-elected President Abdel el-Sisi is considered by Clinton to be governing through what is "basically an army dictatorship." Egypt has always been critical to the stability of the Middle East pertaining to Israel. We need them with us for continued efforts to maintain peace in the region. Clinton's position denigrates a key ally in the Middle East.
Including Iran, potential North Korean nuclear proliferation, unceasing Middle East instability, Chinese incursions into the South China Sea and worsening relations with Russia, the need for strong leadership and a break from the past is clear. Our next president will be faced with numerous meetings with international leaders requiring great negotiating skills. It is tailor-made for a negotiator like Trump.
Time after time, Clinton's performance on national security has led to failure. During a Republican debate earlier this year, Carly Fiorina said, "If you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name an accomplishment of Hillary Clinton." Although they meant it to be somewhat humorous, it is not. National security and foreign affairs are not Clinton's strong suits. Using predictive analysis, the trend line is clear: they will continue to talk large, play small and fail.

DICE will host a livestream event tomorrow, May 26, where it will show off and discuss Battlefield 1's May update. The hour-long livestream event starts at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. Check out the image below to find out when the stream begins wherever you live around the world.
Stay tuned for the #Battlefield 1 May Update Exclusive Sneak Peek Livestream tomorrow Friday, May 26 at 1 PM PDT / 21:00 BST. pic.twitter.com/5xz9prSQJY — Battlefield (@Battlefield) May 25, 2017
As announced in April, Battlefield 1 is now on a once-a-month schedule for new updates. May's update focus on "streamlining the flow into matches (especially Operations) and improving many gameplay grievances that will hopefully make the action feel more balanced and fair," among other things that will presumably be discussed during the livestream event this week.
Battlefield 1's next expansion, In the Name of the Tsar, is scheduled to come out this summer, and it will be shown off during EA's E3 event in June. The expansion's main addition is the Russian Army. Alongside four new maps, the pack will include Russian vehicles, soldiers, and weapons.
Additionally, we recently learned that the Russian Scout class will be represented by a female soldier from the Women's Battalion of Death.

The Philadelphia 76ers were one of the worst teams in recent memory during 2013-14.
They finished 19-63; fielded, according to ESPN.com, the worst offense and fourth-worst defense in the sport; posted the sorriest scoring differential in the NBA; lost a league-record-tying 26 consecutive games; routinely trotted out lineups that were more fit for the NBA D-League than the Association; traded every veteran with even a modicum of value at a deadline fire sale; precipitated a tanking crisis that led to the league voting on, and nearly passing, a measure to disincentive deliberate losing; and literally caused one of their fans to fall asleep courtside during a March game.
And this offseason, they somehow got worse.
Philadelphia, even with two top-10 picks in the ballyhooed 2014 draft—and enough cap space to finance the invasion of a medium-sized nation—managed to enter 2014-15 with a team that was lousier than the one that preceded it.
This remarkable fact is underscored every time the team steps on the floor and makes basketball-like gestures for 48 minutes or so. The Sixers' offensive rating of 90.7, if it holds up, would be the lowest mark in NBA history. They're on pace to win 11 games. Robert Covington, Henry Sims, Hollis Thompson and Brandon Davies—before they were traded to the Brooklyn Nets—each play more than 19 minutes a night.
Of course, there's a plan in Philadelphia. Which is why, rather than calls for their job, general manager Sam Hinkie is the subject of triumphant .gifs and the ubiquitous—in the Philadelphia region, at least—#inhinkiewetrust. He's viewed as a genius because the Sixers, of course, are bad on purpose. They've constructed a deliberately awful roster, so they lose enough games to draft the superstars who will (eventually) catapult Philadelphia back into contention.
Jesse D. Garrabrant/Getty Images
But while the first part of the plan, the failure, is going swimmingly, it's worth wondering when phase two, the unfailure, will begin. My sense is that it will get underway this offseason.
There are a couple reasons why, this summer, it appears the Sixers will shift gears and attempt to actually, possibly, win basketball games.
The first is the roster the franchise has already built. Reinforcements are coming, soon. The kids are growing up.
2014 No. 3 overall draft pick Joel Embiid will likely miss all of 2014-15 with a stress fracture in their navicular bone—the foot injury that ultimately derailed the career of Yao Ming—and Sixers management thinks Embiid will be able to return at full strength by the start of next season.
Embiid is potentially a franchise-altering talent. Before their injury was diagnosed, they were the consensus No. 1 pick in the draft. The center was viewed as a game-changer on the level of Hakeem Olajuwon—raw, maybe, but brimming with rare natural ability.
Several scouts, including one who spoke with Yahoo.com's Marc Spears in May, identified them as the lone franchise building block in the draft.
And when they make their NBA debut next season, the center will make it alongside a frontcourt mate who's also generated their share of hype.
Nerlens Noel was also slated to be the No. 1 pick in their class, 2013, before a torn ACL and some character concerns dropped them to the the No. 6 selection—where the Sixers, after trading All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday, happily snapped them up.
Embiid and Noel, if all goes according to plan, could form a new set of Twin Towers in Philadelphia.
(Granted, the plans might be changing. Philadelphia originally envisioned Noel—with a rebuilt shot—manning the 4, with Embiid slotting in at center. But Noel, since making their debut this season, has shown themselves to be a much more adept 5. It's unclear which way this will go, but it's a situation that bears monitoring. Scott Howard-Cooper covered the development, and its implications, for NBA.com.)
Embiid and Noel, along with 2014 ROY Michael Carter-Williams and 2014 No. 12 pick Dario Saric—who's playing overseas and will likely join Philadelphia before the 2016-17 season—form an interesting core that feels like it's ready to start winning games, soon. Also consider that the Sixers are in pole position to snag the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 draft, and it looks like the future could be now in Philadelphia.
The primary weakness of the Sixers is on the wing—where the team presently gives minutes to promising 2014 second-round pick KJ McDaniels and a handful of other players you almost certainly have never heard of. But, lo and behold, the 2015 free-agent class has two potential superstar wings.
Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler will both be available and make a ton of sense for Philadelphia, who, according to HoopsHype.com, has only $14 million committed in player salary in 2015-15.
Leonard, the 23-year-old reigning MVP of the NBA Finals, is very close to stardom and, in the form of Sixers coach and former San Antonio Spurs assistant Brett Brown, has ties to the organization.
And while their game is improving rapidly, he's already plenty productive. Leonard led the Spurs in wins produced in two of the last three full seasons, according to BoxScore Geeks and led the 2013-14 NBA champs in win shares, according to Basketball-Reference.com.
In 2014-15, before a torn ligament in their hand sidelined them indefinitely, they were putting up one of their best seasons ever, by measure of conventional counting stats at least. Leonard was averaging 17 points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.2 steals, all career highs.
And Butler has been even better.
Andrew Nelles/Associated Press
The 6'7” shooting guard, just 25 years old, is third in the NBA in win shares, per Basketball-Reference.com, and is also averaging 21.9 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists in their fourth NBA season. He's a tremendous defensive player and an absolute workhorse, leading the league in minutes played with 40 a night.
Hinkie cut their teeth in the Houston Rockets organization, and it's helpful to consider the possibility of the Sixers making a move at one, or both, of Leonard and Butler through this lens of that experience. The Rockets catapulted themselves into contention when they traded for James Harden, but, when the trade occurred, Harden wasn't really Harden yet.
They were a great player who'd been very productive and efficient on a tremendous basketball team but only as a tertiary threat. They aren't a superstar, a go-to-guy. That didn't happen until they arrived in Houston.
Of course, it's an open, and valid, question whether any top-tier free agent would sign in Philadelphia given the franchise's woes, especially a pair like Butler and Leonard who are playing in winning situations. But Philadelphia, for two reasons, might prove to be an attractive destination for each.
The first is financial. Both the Spurs and Bulls have, thus far, passed on the opportunity to extent their stars with max contracts. The Bulls only offered Butler a four-year, $40 million contract this offseason, which they turned down, while Leonard decided to enter restricted free agency this coming summer after San Antonio decided against offering them the max. While both teams could match any offer the Sixers made, it's not clear if they would. Philadelphia might be the spot where they could both cash in.
And not only could they make riches in Philly, but they could, and please stifle your laughter, win there soon. The Sixers, as mentioned above, have a surfeit of young talent that's getting closer and closer to making an impact. The team also has, in Sam Hinkie, a GM who's recognized in league circles as one of the savviest in the game. This is a team that, despite it's current troubles, is near universally regarded as having a bright future. And, if both Leonard and Butler take the plunge together, it's a future that suddenly looks even brighter.
There's a notion, and it's largely a correct one, that the Sixers are putting themselves, and their fanbase, through hell so they can land one, or several, superstar players. But that doesn't necessarily mean LeBron James, Kevin Durant or Chris Paul. It could be through identifying players who are capable of superstardom, then giving them the opportunity to distinguish themselves.
The Sixers are close to rewarding their fans for their suffering. They could get several significant steps closer this summer.

Advertisement Editor's Picks The Clock Is Ticking on Bitcoin's Future
This story was corrected on 4 November. Due to an editing error Kraken's response to our request for an interview was omitted.
More than 18 months after the MtGox bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, little is still known about what happened to the 850,000 missing bitcoins. The now defunct Tokyo-based company claimed hacker malleability attacks—illicit alterations of transaction ID numbers—were responsible for the disappearance. MtGox users who traded the virtual currency for fiat money suspected fraud. Whatever the reasons, the fallout appears to have been a financial calamity for Bitcoin investors: the value of a bitcoin dropping from a peak of over $1,000 prior to the exchange's collapse to around $232 today.
Although investigators remain tight lipped about their findings, Tokyo Metropolitan police took Mark Karpeles, the CEO of MtGox, into custody in August on charges of manipulating company accounts and stealing from exchange users. Then on 11 September prosecutors issued a warrant for their arrest, accusing them of embezzling US $2.7 million of clients' money. Karpeles, 30, a French national, has reportedly denied wrongdoing.
Yet these charges represent only a tiny fraction of the 850,000 bitcoins worth around $200 million at today's exchange rate, or about half-a-billion dollars at the time of the MtGox collapse. So the wait to hear what really occurred continues.
“It is only natural for law enforcement, trustee and the forensics team not to give reports when there is an ongoing criminal investigation,” says Pauline Reich, director of Asia-Pacific Cyberlaw, Cybercrime and Internet Security Research Institute in Tokyo. “It will take time. Patience is needed.”
Investors had hopes raised for a quicker explanation when Kraken Bitcoin Exchange, a leading San Francisco-based exchange, was selected last November by the trustee to help the investigation and aid in the distribution of MtGox's remaining assets to creditors. So far, though, Kraken has remained silent and refused to comment for this story . In September Kraken said it would not release any additional information.
One entity not happy to wait for answers is WizSec, a bitcoin security firm established last year in Tokyo by three former MtGox bitcoin investors. The company began conducting its own independent investigation in spring 2014 based on leaked MtGox transaction data published online by hackers, non-public leaked sources, interviews with former MtGox staff and others connected with the company.
Kim Nilsson, head of WizSec, spoke to the foreign press in Tokyo on 14 September and shed some light on the difficulties the authorities are facing, though they pointed out that because a substantial portion of their sources are unverifiable leaked data, they could not claim it to be one hundred percent reliable. However they believe it likely gives a good indication of the state of MtGox customer accounts at the time.
“MtGox had very bad accounting to the point where it might have been non-existent,” said Nilsson. “This has left the case full of holes, which the police will have to extrapolate to fill.”
A major problem, they said, was that clients' bank accounts and company accounts had been comingled, at least early on after the company's launch in 2010. “So company funds and clients' deposits were stored in a single account and used for company expenses.”
WizSec has published two reports on its findings, the latest this February. According to the report's executive summary:
Most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the MtGox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011. As a result, MtGox was technically insolvent for years (knowingly or not) and was practically depleted of bitcoins by 2013.
Christian Decker of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, and co-author of Bitcoin Transaction Malleability and MtGox study [pdf] with colleague Roger Wattenhofer disagrees.
“While it's possible that at the change of ownership [when Karpeles purchased the exchange around March 2011], MtGox was not completely covering its liabilities, it is very unlikely that it was missing a major part of its funds,” Decker told Spectrum. “This is backed by the fact that some of the bitcoins sold on the platform did not enter the Bitcoin economy until later, i.e., they had not been mined then and couldn't have been stolen then.”
The malleability study also discounts MtGox's claim that malleability attacks were responsible for the loss of 850,000 bitcoins. The study concludes “…barely 386 bitcoins could have been stolen using malleability attacks from MtGox or from other businesses.”
But there are areas where the experts are in full agreement. “The main problem with MtGox was not with the bitcoin technology, but with how the company was run,” said Nilsson. “It doesn't matter if you use the strongest bank vault in the world if you leave the keys out.”
Reich concurs. “This is about the bookkeeping at MtGox and not about the technology.”
“The alleged theft is due likely to insecure handling of funds by MtGox in their internal systems,” says Decker. “This would have been the case even if their allegations that transaction malleability was to blame, since they were using faulty network nodes internally.”
As for future expectations, “I believe the technology that powers bitcoin is strong and solid and will definitely make it into the financial industry before the (bitcoin) currency itself does,” said Nilsson. And Decker notes that while Bitcoin technology is still new and experiencing growing pains, “Academia and the industry are continuously working on improving the security of systems built on top of it.”
A veteran of Canada's war in Afghanistan is reaching out to the thief who stole several medals they earned during their 25-year military career.
Retired sgt. Marco St-Gelais had their home in East Angus, Que., burgled earlier this month. The robber took a laptop, some knives, two bottles of rum and what are among St-Gelais's most prized possessions — medals for taking part in missions to Afghanistan, the Golan Heights, Central Africa and Bosnia.
There is a lot of pain in them. There are guys who lost their lives [on those missions]. - Marco St-Gelais on their stolen medals
"Each medal represents something specific," St-Gelais told Radio-Canada. "There is a lot of pain in them. There are guys who lost their lives [on those missions]."
St-Gelais posted a message on Facebook calling on friends to help them get their medals back. Their post has been shared almost 4,000 times since then.
A question of respect
St-Gelais said he's not interested in pressing charges, they just wants their medals returned.
"If the person who stole them is [reading] this and realizes they did wrong, or didn't know what they were doing, just put them in a cardboard box and drop it off at my door," St-Gelais said.
They encouraged anyone who happens to see the medals in a pawn shop to buy them. They promise to pay them back.
The Canadian military can provide exact replicas of the medals, but for St-Gelais they won't have the same emotional value as the originals.
Losing the medals to theft, moreover, comes with an added slight to their identity as a veteran.
"I thought Canadian soldiers were well respected in this country," St-Gelais said. "This shows that I'm not respected."
People tend to forget that the state of New York is really at least two distinct entities: the city and its surrounding bedroom communities on the one hand, and the rest of the state on the other. Earlier this year, Governor Andrew Cuomo (smirking at right) and the urban contingent rammed through new gun restrictions that were so well-crafted that lawmakers had to quickly revisit the legislation to exempt law-enforcement officers and to revise the law's requirement for (almost non-existent) seven-round magazines to accommodate ten-round magazines into which state residents are only allowed to load seven cartridges. (Watching New York government in action is less like seeing sausage being made and more like observing chimpanzees mold mud pies.) Now the rest of the state is having its say. Upstate sheriffs, under pressure from enraged constituents, say the state's gun controls are unconstitutional, and they won't enforce the damned law.
Mark Boshnack of the Oneonta Daily Star writes:
The New York State Sheriffs Association and five individual sheriffs have joined a court effort to block enforcement of new bullet limits for magazines and firearms restrictions. Schoharie County Sheriff Tony Desmond said they have no intention of enforcing the law, and that their office won't do anything that would cause law-abiding citizens to turn in their weapons or arrest them for possessing firearms. “I'm not going back on my personal conviction,” they said. Residents have told them this is what they want, they said, and “I've stood up for them, and I will continue to do so.”
Sheriff Desmond's comment came after Gov. Cuomo called a vow to ignore the law by a candidate for sheriff in Saratoga County "a dangerous and frightening precedent."
Erie County Sheriff Tim Howard also refuses to enforce the law—a position taken by a half-dozen of the upstate elected officials. The New York State Sheriffs' Association joined a lawsuit to overturn the gun restrictions, saying "The laws appear willfully blind to legitimate safety interests, and instead are tailored to impact, and negatively impact, law-abiding firearm owners."
Even some officials who say they will enforce the law admit they won't put much effort into it, because that wouldn't be too healthy in areas where large numbers of constituents openly vow defiance. For North Country Public Radio, Brian Mann reported:
Right from the start, many gun owners said they wouldn't comply with the law, which they say violates the 2nd amendment and turns them unfairly into criminals. That puts sheriffs like Dave Favro in rural Clinton County in a tight spot. “I don't want to see a citizen revolt, because that's going to create more violence in one sense. However, I can understand…this is an infringement and where does it stop?” Favro asked. So Favro hates this law. They say many of their best friends – and the people who vote them into office – absolutely love their guns and won't ever comply with the SAFE Act's restrictions.
What's interesting is that Governor Cuomo anticipated this defiance after the law passed and promised to oust any sheriffs who opposed them on the issue. That the Sheriffs' Association joined the lawsuit after that heated meeting shows the effectiveness of Cuomo's threats.
At the start of the Civil War, Mayor Fernando Wood threatened to take New York City out of both the state and the union and create an independent city-state. With the population of the metropolis politically at odds with much of the rest of the state, rural New Yorkers might wish Wood had followed through and saved them the trouble of their own rebellion.
By the way, watch today's recall votes in Colorado for a similar intrastate battle over self-defense rights.
Dear Men on the Left,
Harvey Jeni Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 17, 2017
It was sometime in 2006 that I remember sitting on my sofa, watching George Galloway pretend to be a cat. Enthralling and disturbing in equal measure though it was, (poor Rula) it was not what struck me about the man. Lodged in my mind far more firmly are the comments they made regarding fellow housemate and glamour model, Jodie Marsh: that perhaps some might feel it sexist, but they believed deep down they likely longed for nothing more than a quiet life of marriage and motherhood. I remember I gasped in disbelief. Had they really just said that? The man on the left beside me didn't even flinch.
I wish I could say that were the first time it had dawned on me that some men supposedly on my side were not, but the instances are too many to name. The tale of one visiting man, loaded into a shopping trolley and forcibly wheeled off site by exasperated Greenham women, was a staple of my childhood. Later, as a young activist, I would absorb the subtle messages designed to steer me towards the role of burner of the home fires and entertainer of the troops — a role I didn't like and had never once asked for. Later still, I would hear in horror of the woman shunned by their supposedly radical community for turning in desperation to the police in the face of domestic violence. For much of my life as a left wing woman, I have been among left wing men. Full of machismo and high ideals, defenders of the poor, the earth, and of human rights and freedoms, some were men I much admired. But running a fine, near invisible thread through it all were the quiet, guiltily told stories of women; stories recognisable from any vantage point. For whether they are of the left, right, or centre, or even if they prefer to spoil their ballot, some women's stories remain the same.
More recently I have watched, without surprise, men such as Michael Moore, Yanis Varoufakis, and Ken Loach speak up in defence of Julian Assange, who it seems could not possibly be a rapist when there are far more plausible explanations, such as CIA honey traps and lying women, to be had. I have also watched with a strange mix of curiosity, hope, and foreboding as men on the left have developed, out of nowhere, a sudden feminist consciousness. Whereas traditionally men have always been so hostile to the idea of women's liberation, male feminists are now ten a penny, clustering enthusiastically around an altogether more sexy and palatable third wave, bestowing upon it their generous approval, offering suggestions, and claiming it as their own.
Yet nowhere is the misogyny of the left more apparent than in the current conflict around transgender issues. It is here that men most like to congregate, hiding behind a claim to advocate fairness and equality, aggressively signalling their no cost virtue. Risking nothing in terms of power or rights, they sit easily atop their high horses, shouting down at those of us with everything to lose, insulting us if we do not acquiesce to their view.
As an example, a commissioning editor at The Guardian, Chris Godfrey, recently described as “vile, transphobic trash” a painstakingly researched and frankly heartbreaking article highlighting the ways in which homophobic bullying of young lesbians can set them on a path to becoming trans men. The article had been written by a well respected female journalist and included quotes from both concerned medical professionals (apparently there are many) and a detransitioned woman, who stated explicitly that harassment due to their sexuality had been a huge factor in them seeking to transition. Real women, whose real lives have been turned upside down, summarily dismissed by a man who will never understand what it is to be a female, or lesbian, forced to navigate a hostile world.
On a recent radio show, self described champagne socialist, James O'Brien, recently encouraged listeners to ring in for a discussion on gender identity, claiming to want to understand the concerns some women and parents had about gender neutral spaces. A woman attempting to voice their opinion was interrupted by O'Brien no less than seventeen times as they hectored, mocked, and bullied her, refusing to let them speak. They judged as paranoid their reluctance to share fitting rooms with male bodied people. “Would you feel comfortable getting changed in a room next to me?” they demanded, daring them to say no. “What do you think I'm going to do?” In the current climate of mass disclosure and growing understanding as to the universal nature of women's experience of sexual abuse and harassment, and given that many men on the left have loudly voiced their shock and condemnation, I find O'Brien's claim to cluelessness extraordinarily disingenuous. They also appear to lack the self awareness necessary to realise they just scored something of an own goal: their aggressive refusal to accept a woman's clearly stated boundaries showing a man none of us would want in the next changing cubicle.
It is well documented that the term TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminist) is inextricably linked with misogynist abuse, death threats, and violence against women, yet many leftist men continue to delight in using it. Former spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn, Matt Zarb-Cousin, complains that socially liberal TERFS are standing in the way of progress. One can only assume their idea of progress is for women no longer to be able to organise politically and exclusively with those of the same sex in order to fight their sex based oppression.  They are fond of using the term TERF in place of a woman's actual name, clearly seeing no need to speak to women like real human beings when there are dehumanising pejoratives to hand. “Jog on terf,” they type with palpable glee, presumably knowing they cannot get away with bitch.
Finally, in a recent tweet, leftist thinker and columnist Owen Jones wrote: “If ‘TERF' is unacceptable, let's just use ‘transphobe' and ‘transphobic' — problem solved” in an attempt to further cement the idea that any feminist thought critical of gender ideology is to be shut down and denounced, without debate or question. Now that men such as Jones have found a way to deny natal women's specific rights and experience, and to dismiss, shout, and sneer at us whilst still retaining their veneer of political righteousness, it is hard to miss the relish with which some take up the task.
Fluent in the language of modern feminism, Jones and their ilk claim to be on the side of women. Yet all the empathy and anger they can muster appears reserved only for those self identified women born with the same bodies and biology as themselves. Outraged, they quote (often misleading) statistics on the violence experienced by trans women as though seeing the reality of male violence for the very first time. Perhaps violence against women and girls has always made them this angry, yet it is not an anger familiar to me. After all there has been pandemic, fatal violence committed by men against natal women since records began. We have been raped, burned at the stake, sold into sexual slavery, and are still killed, two of us a week, by men who claim — or once did — to love us. Where was all this righteous rage on our behalf? And if we accept there was none, or at least none equivalent in intensity, then how are we to interpret this sudden, furious epiphany?
Dear men on the left, I'm going to tell you something and you're not going to like it. When it comes to rank misogyny, you are often no better than men on the right. Your claim to feminism cannot be made reconcilable with your attacks on women with whom you disagree, and neither is your claim to a belief in fairness and equality compatible with ripping up our hard won rights.
You are no better when you tell us we have no right to an opinion on what the word woman means. You are no better when you call us names known to incite threats of rape and violence, because we do not understand gender in the way you would wish us to. And you are no better when you refuse to listen to, empathise with, or try to understand our point of view.
Dear men on the left, have a look around you. You cannot build a better, fairer world on the backs of women. It will only ever take a few of us to get to our feet for it all to come tumbling down.
From the “that ain't gonna fly” department:
by Fred Palmer – Washington Examiner
Al Gore wants to reverse modernity and save the world from itself through an elimination of its fossil-fuel-based energy system. During the final week of April, their newly created Energy Transitions Commission released a document setting forth a fool's-errand pathway to “decarbonize” the world's energy system.
If this sounds familiar, it is. Gore's plan features a new, sophisticated, and expensive public-relations campaign, but it's all based on their views on carbon dioxide first broached in their 1992 book Earth in the Balance, which they reissued in 2000 for their failed presidential campaign. The subsequent efforts made by Gore during the past 25 years have transformed little from their genesis, and they remain as tragically wrong today as they were when they first surfaced as an opponent of everything linked to carbon-dioxide.
If you scroll through the verbiage surrounding the document, you will find the core policy recommendation is a massive, punishing carbon tax. Gore would start the tax at $50 per ton, which would increase to $100 per ton over time, essentially destroying the market for continued robust development of the world's fossil-fuel base. Our economic growth and personal well-being depends on robust fossil-fuel use, so Gore's plan would destroy these as well.
But, don't worry! The all-in estimated cost to re-engineer humanity is only a mere $15 trillion—enough money to give every man, woman, and child in the United States more than $46,000.
Al Gore has been demonizing fossil fuels and attempting to marginalize all those involved in the traditional energy sector since 1988, the year the climate-change movement was rolled out in Washington, D.C., which happened to correspond with a nationwide heatwave and with Yellowstone in flames. Ever since, Gore's pathway to political power and personal riches has been a successful one, to be sure, but their multi-trillion-dollar effort today is their most sophisticated effort to date. Unfortunately for him, it will also fail, because what he's selling in their “new” proposal is bad for the people being asked to embrace it.

By Kevin Green - YORK COUNTY, Va. (WAVY) — The York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office announced Monday morning that it recently added the words "In God We Trust" to it patrol cars.
In a statement on the department's Facebook page Monday, Sheriff J.D. "Danny" Diggs said the decals cost $1,480, and that no taxpayer money was used to purchase them.
The decals were reportedly paid for by Diggs personally.
In Monday's post, Diggs stated:
"Having ‘In God We Trust' on our vehicles does not injure or threaten anyone. It is not an attempt to urge anyone to support or convert to any one religion. God has blessed me and the Sheriff's Office. This is one way of honoring God by acknowledging Him for Their blessings upon us and it shows our patriotism by displaying our national motto."

Diggs also stated Monday, "The legislatures and courts approve, and God is most certainly approving of this."
The Virginia General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2001, part of which supported and encouraged "public display of the national motto in all public buildings, public schools and other government institutions in Virginia."
Diggs also said Monday, "Based on the experience of others who have done this, there will certainly be a very small minority that will criticize."

Week 4 Rankings: Standard | PPR
Three weeks into the season and the wide receiver position hasn't turned out exactly like we thought. Each of the "big three" has had at least one awful game so far and the top 10 includes four players who weren't taken before Round 5 in most drafts (Larry Fitzgerald, Marvin Jones, Doug Baldwin, Stefon Diggs) and a guy who was barely drafted at all (Mike Wallace).
Even more stunning, only two receivers have posted 10-plus Fantasy points (standard scoring) in every game so far this season: Mike Evans, who's a stud of course, and Sterling Shepard.
Aside from Evans, which of these receivers will trail off and should be traded immediately?
View Profile Marvin Jones DET • WR • 11 2016 stats TAR 29 REC 18 YDS 408 TD 2
In non-PPR formats, Marvin Jones is the highest-scoring receiver in the game. It's thanks to a monster Week 3 where they caught six passes for 205 yards and two touchdowns. They can't keep that up, but they can definitely continue to do damage on the eight-plus targets he's had in every game so far (some in the mid-range, some on deep passes). With 408 yards, he's on track for a breakout season, but he's also coming off of a career-game. Jones will carry high value because he's the No. 1 receiver in a pass-heavy offense. That doesn't mean you shouldn't consider offers for him, but don't hustle them off after this big game for mediocre talent.
Fair deal: Marvin Jones and Frank Gore for Todd Gurley and Will Fuller
View Profile Doug Baldwin SEA • WR • 89 2016 stats TAR 27 REC 20 YDS 276 TD 2
Few would pony up a big offer for Baldwin, and few would trade them away without getting something big in return. It kind of limits their Fantasy movement even though he's had two games already with at least 15 Fantasy points. A lot is up in the air regarding Baldwin's future -- Russell Wilson's health, the status of the Seahawks offensive line and what impact Jimmy Graham could have. It could all work in Baldwin's favor, or it could cost Baldwin quality targets. Chances are you'll keep Baldwin as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver.
Fair deal: Doug Baldwin and Arian Foster for Jordan Howard and DeSean Jackson
View Profile Larry Fitzgerald ARI • WR • 11 2016 stats TAR 32 REC 20 YDS 218 TD 3
Last week was the first time we saw John Brown and Michael Floyd play prominently in the Cardinals offense, and Fitzgerald was held in check. To be fair, Carson Palmer was completely neutralized and wound up being ineffective, which obviously hurt Fitz as well. No one can deny Fitzgerald is Palmer's top target -- he's led the team in that department every game this season. He's also just as big of a red-zone threat as David Johnson, which helps him. So one bad game shouldn't send people into a panic here. If anything, the door is slightly open for Fantasy owners to try and get them on the cheap.
Fair deal: Larry Fitzgerald for Melvin Gordon
View Profile Stefon Diggs MIN • WR • 14 2016 stats TAR 27 REC 20 YDS 325 TD 1
Now's not the time to trade Diggs. After a great start they were practically invisible in Week 3, garnering 40 yards and reminding us of their 2015 skid. Sam Bradford is to blame for that as they got off to an abysmal start (4 of 11 passing for 26 yards at halftime) and the Vikings had the ball for essentially 25 minutes of game clock. That didn't work in Diggs favor but their skill set and role in the Minnesota offense remains desirable. If you can trade for them at a discount, do it. If you own him, keep them unless someone overpays.
Fair deal: Stefon Diggs for Christine Michael
View Profile Mike Wallace PHI • WR • 14 2016 stats TAR 18 REC 10 YDS 166 TD 3
There aren't many Fantasy owners buying into Wallace as a reliable starter. Maybe it's because he's rarely been reliable. Their first two games were great, but in Week 3 they finished fourth on the team in targets with sixth, catching three of them. Worse, they dropped a would-be 19-yard touchdown. At this point he's as feast-or-famine as Will Fuller, but when good matchups present themselves, Fantasy owners should want to take the risk. That's the case both this week and next week given who the Ravens play.
Fair deal: Mike Wallace for Matt Jones
View Profile Sterling Shepard NYG • WR • 87 2016 stats TAR 19 REC 16 YDS 233 TD 2
The Giants rookie has been sensational, torching opponents for 14.6 yards per catch and helping Fantasy owners out with at least 10 points per week. For now he's a safe starter since he'll almost always see single coverage with Odell Beckham on the field, but there's always that risk of hitting a rookie wall around Week 10 or 11. The timing is right to sell high on Shepard knowing their ceiling is about what he's delivered over the last three weeks, and it's a certainty they won't keep it up all year long.
Fair deal: Sterling Shepard for Jordan Matthews
What are the Trade Values? The chart is designed to help guide you in making fair trades in your standard-scoring or PPR leagues. The values assigned to the players below are a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. By adding two players' values you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. This list also works as a "Rest of Season" rankings. Also, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points.

This year's 13th issue of Shogakukan's Weekly Big Comic Spirits magazine is revealing on Monday that Jun Mayuzuki's Koi wa Ameagari no youni (Love is Like After the Rain) manga will reveal an important announcement in the magazine's next issue on March 6.
The manga centers on 17-year-old high school student Akira Tachibana, a girl who barely expresses herself. They harbor a secret crush on Masami Kondō, the 45-year-old manager of the family restaurant they work at part-time.
Mayuzuki launched the manga in Shogakukan's Monthly Big Comic Spirits in 2014, before it transferred to Weekly Big Comic Spirits early 2016, where it serializes a new chapter every other week. Shogakukan published the manga's sixth compiled book volume in October, and will publish the manga's seventh volume on March 10.

Tom Gagné traces the connection between the aftermath of last year's Gezi Park struggle and a new upsurge of protests in the wake of a government corruption scandal.
SINCE THE end of last summer, anti-corruption protests have become a steady fixture of Turkey's political landscape--and they have escalated going into the new year, amid recent financial scandals.
At the end of last May, the struggle for Gezi Park--a small green area in the middle of the Taksim Square business district of Istanbul, slated to be bulldozed as part of an "urban renewal" project--began with a series of semi-spontaneous protests that spiraled into an occupation and ongoing demonstrations into the summer.
Like the preceding movement of the indignados ("the indignants") that took over Spain's public squares or the Occupy Wall Street movement in the U.S., Gezi Park became a lightning rod for strong anti-government sentiment. As the upheaval spread through Istanbul and around the country, only a handful of small towns were left untouched by popular resistance.
The intense months of unrest pitted demonstrators--at first mainly young and from the left, but broadening in their social makeup--against the well-equipped police and organized pro-government forces. Like most mass social and political upheavals, the conflict was at times bloody and violent, resulting in the deaths of no less than six heroic activists. The street battles were reminiscent of Egypt--people inspired by the Gezi struggle last June talked about how spring had come to Turkey.
Democracy demonstrators fill Taksim Square at night during the Gezi Park protests
For a younger generation of Turks, the role of the state and the police became clear. The struggle became about much more than the last remaining green space in the country's economic center, raising much larger radical questions that had simmered beneath the political surface for years.
While the movement didn't achieve its most immediate aim of protecting the park, it has challenged the legitimacy of the government and the corrupt business interests behind it.
SINCE THE Gezi Park protests, formal politics in Turkey have been in a state of turmoil. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan have faced global scrutiny and local unpopularity. Until recently, Turkey was viewed as an emerging economy with strong potential for growth, but a damning report by the International Monetary Fund claims the country is on an unsustainable path.
A ruling elite that previously was emboldened to press its economic and cultural exports from Casablanca to Cairo, particularly in the wake of the Arab Spring, now finds itself unable to regain the confidence of the population and refuses to see the crisis unfolding before it.
The AKP, a center-right party with roots in political Islamism, came to power in elections in 2001 and again in 2007. It has been successful in displacing the longstanding political supremacy of the military in Turkey, including through means of a legal crackdown. The AKP is reliably pro-free market and pro-U.S., but its populist image has become tarnished, particularly after the violence of last year.
A dramatic corruption scandal revealed late last year has made matters worse for the AKP. On December 17, officials of the Istanbul Security Directory announced the results of an investigation into financial crimes and the detention of 47 people--the total has since risen to nearly 100--including high-ranking officials in the AKP government, the sons of several cabinet ministers among them.
The investigation revealed that many AKP politicians and their cohorts have been involved in a financial triangle of gold-running between Turkey and Iran, through an intermediary between the two--the Turkish state-run bank Halk Bankası.
Turkey, unable to pay back its debt on natural gas and oil exports to Iran due to the regime of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU, resorted to the unconventional means of establishing an account for Iran through Halk Bankası. Iran, in turn, turned all these deposits into gold and transferred them back to Turkey. According to the investigation, bribes to various officials to keep things quiet added up to at least $70 million. Some $4.5 million in cash was found stored in shoeboxes in the possession of Halk Bankası's general manager, Süleyman Aslan.
The scandal is putting major strains on political alliances made during the years of the AKP's ascendency starting in 2001. In particular, the corruption scandal has played out as a battle for influence between Erdoğan and their government, and the conservative religious movement Hizmet, led by the self-exile, business-friendly Islamist scholar Fethullah Gülen.
Gülen, who has based themselves in the U.S., retains a surprising amount of influence within the police, the judiciary and other social institutions in Turkey--so much so that Erdoğan has claimed that Gülen is at the center of an international conspiracy that orchestrated the exposure of corruption. What were once minor differences in an unhappy marriage between the two have become an ever-widening rift.
The AKP had fired hundreds of police officers involved in the corruption investigation. Gülen has denounced this as a purge of political opponents; Erdoğan claims the investigation itself was a "judicial coup" carried out by those jealous of their success.
The political uproar has continued. Erdoğan has threatened to expel ambassadors from countries allegedly involved in the "conspiracy," while EU authorities are claiming that the prime minister is in breach of rules regarding the country's entry into membership.
Claims of new revelations dominate the headlines, even now--including a supposed recording of a phone conversation from the day before news of the scandal broke, in which Erdoğan instructs their son to hide large sums of cash. Whether or not the recording turns out to be a fake, the political reality is that may as well be authentic.
THE SOCIAL tinderbox left behind from last spring and summer's struggles has been reignited. People are back in the streets of Istanbul and other major cities for demonstrations that denounce the government, and they are again being met by police and state violence. Clashes between protesters and police are again common in Istanbul.
One point of conflict is legislation imposing new restrictions on the Internet. Signed into law in mid-February, it gives the government the authority to block websites and censor Internet content without a judge's approval, if officials deem the communications are harmful to the "interests of the nation." Meanwhile, the government has unilaterally released suspects from the corruption investigation and moved to curb the power of the judiciary.
The main opposition party in Turkey, the Republican People's Party (CHP), which faced its own tumultuous corruption scandal back in the 1990s, has called on Erdoğan to resign and leave the country.
These protests shouldn't be seen as separate from the political explosion around Gezi Park last summer, but as a new stage in the Turkish Spring. While the immediate outcome of the Gezi Park resistance appears to have been failure after two long months of protests and street fighting, the struggle has continued--and shifted along with changing political circumstances.
A new generation of Turkish people is finding its collective political voice. While the Turkish ruling class falls back on outdated xenophobia and conspiracy theories that have been effective in the past for the purpose of social control, more and more people, ranging from activists and radicals to trade unionists and beyond, are defiantly expressing an alternative.
What is the first thing that comes to mind when you need to track system calls made and received by a process? You'll probably think of strace , and you are right. What tool would you use to monitor raw network traffic from the command line? If you thought about tcpdump , you made an excellent choice again. And if you ever run into the need to having to keep track of open files (in the Unix sense of the word: everything is a file), chances are you'll use lsof .
strace , tcpdump , and lsof are indeed great utilities that should be part of every sysadmin's toolset, and that is precisely the reason why you will love sysdig , a powerful open source tool for system-level exploration and troubleshooting, introduced by its creators as "strace + tcpdump + lsof + awesome sauce with a little Lua cherry on top." Humor aside, one of the great features of sysdig resides in its ability not only to analyze the "live" state of a Linux system, but also to save the state in a dump file for offline inspection. What's more, you can customize sysdig 's behavior or even enhance its capabilities by using built-in (or writing your own) small scripts called chisels. Individual chisels are used to analyze sysdig -captured event streams in various script-specific fashions.
In this tutorial we'll explore the installation and basic usage of sysdig to perform system monitoring and troubleshooting on Linux.
Installing Sysdig
For this tutorial, we will choose to use the automatic installation process described in the official website for the sake of simplicity, brevity, and distribution agnosticity. In the automatic process, the installation script automatically detects the operating system and installs all the necessary dependencies.
Run the following command as root to install sysdig from the official apt/yum repository:
# curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/install-sysdig | bash
Once the installation is complete, we can invoke sysdig as follows to get a feel for it:
# sysdig
Our screen will be immediately filled with all that is going on in our system, not allowing us to do much more with that information. For that reason, we will run:
# sysdig -cl | less
to see a list of available chisels.
The following categories are available by default, each of which is populated by multiple built-in chisels.
CPU Usage
Errors
I/O
Logs
Misc
Net
Performance
Security
System State
To display information (including detailed command-line usage) on a particular chisel, run:
# sysdig -cl [chisel_name]
For example, we can check information about spy_port chisel under "Net" category by running:
# sysdig -i spy_port
Chisels can be combined with filters (which can be applied to both live data or a trace file) to obtain more useful output.
Filters follow a "class.field" structure. For example:
De Blasio. | Demetrius Freeman/Mayoral Photography Office De Blasio group cancels planned Iowa presidential forum
The Progressive Agenda, the nonprofit group launched by Mayor Bill de Blasio to advance their national political agenda, is canceling its plans for a presidential forum in Iowa next month, the group said Tuesday afternoon.
The group's executive director Geri Prado said in an emailed statement that the forum is being canceled because income inequality has become a more central part of the presidential race, and the forum is no longer necessary.
Story Continued Below
“A year ago, income inequality was not at the center of the national debate. The result was low voter turnout, and a determination by everyday Americans that politicians must address the inequality crisis," Prado said.
The group will "refocus its action on new plans that channel the voices of everyday people to impact candidates, leaders, and elected officials at every level of government," the Progressive Agenda Committee announced in its release.
The forum had become something of a political headache for de Blasio, who had taken pains to distance themselves from the planned event amid accusations that they were focusing too much on national politics at the expense of New York City's own problems.
Shortly before the release was sent, de Blasio was vague in an interview on NY1 about whether or not they planned to attend the forum.
It is also unclear whether any presidential candidates had committed to attending the event, which had been scheduled for Dec. 6 in Iowa City.
In the statement sent by the Progressive Agenda Committee, Prado said the forum wasn't the most effective way to advance its mission.
“It is clear other efforts beyond the previously-planned presidential forum will more effectively advance the cause of fighting income inequality. However, TPAC will continue to work with our leaders at the local, state and federal levels to implement tangible solutions to what is the crisis of our time," Prado said, adding, “In the weeks to come, TPAC will roll out a new Leadership Council, and will implement an aggressive multi-platform communications effort with our supporters to ensure these issues remain part of the national conversation — throughout this election season, and into the future."
Data audits at some of the country's banks have revealed that the credit histories of thousands of customers have been misreported to the Irish Credit Bureau.
RTÉ News has learned that the problems have been identified by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in customer credit records at more than one financial institution, including Permanent TSB.
The audits followed last August's admission by AIB that, due to a systems error, it had over a six year period misreported the credit histories of 12,000 of its customers to the ICB.
The ICB is a private company owned by banks and financial institutions here, which collates customer credit histories on behalf of those banks.
The error at AIB involved the State-owned bank sending incorrect details about customers' missed repayments to the ICB, which resulted in their credit histories looking worse than they actually were.
This, in turn, may have impacted on the ability of the customers involved to access fresh credit.
The ICB and the bank have since worked together to correct all the wrong data.
AIB's admission prompted the Data Commissioner to begin a trawl of credit reporting systems at the country's other main banks.
The commissioner's office would not comment on the detail of its findings so far but a spokesperson confirmed preliminary results indicate a need for a number of financial institutions to inform some customers that they have had their credit records categorised incorrectly by the ICB.
It is understood that several thousand customers are involved.
In a statement to RTÉ News Permanent TSB has revealed that, following the revelations at AIB but prior to the Data Commissioner's audit, it initiated its own preliminary investigation which identified some errors in data supplied to the ICB.
The error involved incorrect reporting of missed repayments on certain loans which were being repaid weekly or fortnightly as opposed to monthly.
The bank said that, on becoming aware of the issue, it immediately notified the relevant regulators including the Central Bank, the Data Commissioner and the ICB and initiated a review which is now underway.
A spokesperson for the bank said it apologised unreservedly for the problem and was taking immediate steps to resolve this issue and rectify the matter.
The spokesperson would not reveal how many customers were affected.
It is understood other institutions where audits have been completed by the Data Commissioner include Bank of Ireland and National Irish Bank.
An NIB spokesperson confirmed it had been audited last week but no results have been received yet.
Meanwhile a spokesperson for Bank of Ireland would not comment on the matter as it was also awaiting the Data Commissioner's report.
However sources at the bank said at this stage it appears no issues have been identified.
The state's highest court on Wednesday ordered prosecutors to drop a large portion of the more than 24,000 drug convictions affected by the misconduct of former state drug lab chemist Annie Dookhan, issuing an urgent call to resolve a scandal that has plagued the legal system since 2012.
The Supreme Judicial Court declined to order a wholesale dismissal of the cases potentially tainted by Dookhan's mishandling of drug evidence, as lawyers for the defendants had sought. But in the ruling, the justices acknowledged that the state's handling of the cases so far has been inadequate.
The court said district attorneys across the state must “exercise their prosecutorial discretion and reduce the number of relevant Dookhan defendants by moving to vacate and dismiss with prejudice all drug cases the district attorneys would not or could not reprosecute if a new trial were ordered.” The cases affected by the ruling include people who pleaded guilty, were convicted, or admitted that prosecutors had enough evidence to convict them. By vacating the cases, the convictions would effectively be erased.

In the ruling, the court acknowledged the enormity of the task before prosecutors, giving them 90 days to decide which cases to throw out and which are supported by other evidence.

The court's remedy “maintains the fairness and integrity of our criminal justice system in the wake of a laboratory scandal of unprecedented magnitude,” the court ruling states.
Before Wednesday's decision, defendants were responsible for appealing their cases if they thought they should be dismissed. Though the court had earlier directed prosecutors and defense attorneys to set up a system for appeals, the justices ruled that the case-by case approach was moving at an unacceptable crawl — with only 2,000 cases addressed.
Civil liberties advocates said they expected thousands more Dookhan cases to now be scrubbed from the record.
Dookhan, who was a chemist in the state-run drug lab in Jamaica Plain, admitted that they tampered with drug evidence and served more than three years in prison.

“This has been a years-long saga, and this is really a crucial breakthrough for the thousands of people who were convicted based on tainted evidence,” said Matt Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which worked on the case.
The court said defendants whose cases aren't dismissed should receive a notice that their cases had been affected by Dookhan's misconduct. Then, any indigent defendants would receive public counsel to explore requests to vacate their pleas or get new trials.
In a statement, Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan, who leads the state District Attorneys Association, said their office was reviewing the decision in advance of a Monday meeting with a judge.
“Today the court recognized the longstanding principle that prosecutors should determine the cases appropriate for trial,” they said. “We are already beginning to implement the court's directive about the evaluation of cases.”
There was no estimate of how many cases might be dropped as a result of the decision, but the SJC noted that 90 percent of the affected convictions occurred in district courts, which handle less serious crimes. The justices also noted that a majority of the defendants were convicted of possession alone, and that “virtually all of these defendants have already served the entirety of their sentences.”

Randy Gioia, deputy chief counsel of the public defender division of the state Committee for Public Counsel Services, said they hope that fact will move prosecutors to aggressively abandon tainted convictions.
“The vast majority of the cases are finished,” they said. “People have completed their sentences, they've done their probation, so it's not a question of public safety.”
Associate Justice Geraldine S. Hines wrote the only dissent, arguing that the court should have thrown out all affected convictions. The court had also considered dismissing all the convictions and allowing prosecutors the option to retry those cases, but Hines rejected even that prospect.
“The need to adopt a swift and sure remedy for the harm caused by [Dookhan's] deceit presents itself with palpable urgency. The time has come to close the book on this scandal, once and for all, by adopting a global remedy,” Hines wrote.
Peter Elikann, a criminal defense lawyer and spokesperson for the Massachusetts Bar Association, said the court walked a fine line with its majority opinion.
“Much of it hinges on relying on the prosecutors to cull the good from the bad cases and reduce the number of cases out there,” they said.

Two of the New Orleans Saints' starting offensive linemen will become unrestricted free agents on Tuesday -- right tackle Zach Strief and center Brian De la Puente. It's still possible the Saints could re-sign one or both of them. But they're content to see how the market shapes up before making any decisions.
If Strief and De la Puente leave, the Saints have young backups who could compete for their roles with third-year right tackle Bryce Harris and second-year guard/center Tim Lelito. They could also add potential starters at either spot in the draft. But they would probably want to add some veteran options in free agency as insurance.
The most obvious candidate for that type of role would be former Saints center Jonathan Goodwin, who is now a free agent again after three years as a starter for the San Francisco 49ers. Goodwin, 35, would be a natural stopgap while the Saints develop a young future replacement.
There aren't many top-notch centers available in their primes right now. Most analysts rank either De la Puente or the Green Bay Packers' Evan Dietrich-Smith as the top available options. Maybe Dietrich-Smith is slightly better, but the Saints would probably prefer to keep the guy they know at that price range.
Among the cheaper options at center would be the Atlanta Falcons' Joe Hawley, who was decent when they stepped into a starting role last year.
There are many more options available at right tackle, where the Saints could attempt to upgrade or at least get younger if they want to move on from Strief. The Cincinnati Bengals' Anthony Collins (28) and the New York Jets' Austin Howard (27 later this month) both had their best seasons to date in 2014 after beginning their careers as backups. Seattle Seahawks starter Breno Giacomini is another strong option in that same range.
The Baltimore Ravens' Michael Oher, 28, is a big name and a big, powerful run-blocker. But they have been inconsistent as a pass-protector throughout their career.
Older options who might be considered on short-term deals include the Arizona Cardinals' Eric Winston and the Tennessee Titans' David Stewart.
ESPN NFL Insiders Matt Williamson and Adam Caplan both said they didn't see many options the Saints should aggressively pursue -- though they did both mention Giacomini.
"With the offensive line, I keep coming back to their guys already," Williamson said of Strief and de la Puente. "Anthony Collins, to me, is about the same player as Strief but can also play left tackle. Giacomini is a mauler, you can run behind them on early downs. Austin Howard came out of nowhere and has exceeded expectations. Their arrow is up, but they probably won't ever be 'great.' "
Jeff Bezos once said, 'if you make customers unhappy in the physical world, they might each tell 6 friends. If you make customers unhappy on the Internet, they can each tell 6,000 friends.'
Now that the physical world is fully linked to Internet, especially in commerce, any stupid act is bound to explode in a ball of flames, which is what Best Buy is finding out this week.
According to the Consumerist, after a customer purchased five 2GB flash drives on the company's site at an 87% discount, an assistant manager failed to honor the discount (citing a pricing mistake), when the buyer went to pick them up at a store. The assistant said an email with the correction was sent, but the customer never received it. But that happens sometimes, right?
What doesn't is what happened next: The assistant called the customer service line and impersonated the customer, deceptively, to cancel the order (while said customer was standing right in front of him). Incredulous that the assistant would falsely pretend to be him, the customer demanded their order be approved. The assistant, in turn, offered them a gift card to replace the one they used with their order.
When they tried to talk to the main Best Buy customer service line after the fact, they were told there was nothing the company could do. Because the order had been cancelled. By him.
Not only was this turn of events insulting, it's probably also illegal. According to many state laws, companies are required to honor a deal where a transaction has been made, or they should honestly let the customer know there was an error. This can cover legitimate database glitches or an honest human blunder.
Best Buy didn't do either of those because the customer never received that email. According to the Law of state where the transaction was made, the customer is eligible for triple damages, or about $240.
So far, there is no word on whether Best Buy gave the customer their money, or the drives. But they have a huge PR fireball on their hands.
What do you think? Should Best Buy honor the deal? If they did in fact send them an email but the customer never received it, should they still receive compensation because they were insulted and impersonated?
LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - Global greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector are expected to peak in 2029 and then start falling, but will still be some way above levels needed to limit temperature rise, research showed on Tuesday.
Electricity generation worldwide is forecast to rise by 56 percent by 2040 as economies develop and populations grow, which will hit a peak in power sector emissions of 15.3 gigatonnes in 2029 from 13.1 gigatonnes now, a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.
World emissions will start to fall after 2029 to 14.8 gigatonnes in 2040, which is 13 percent above 2014 levels.
This will make it very unlikely that the world will be able to limit average the rise in temperature to within 2 degrees Celsius, a threshold seen by scientists as necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
“We will see tremendous progress towards a decarbonised power system. Despite this, coal will continue to play a big part in world power with emissions continuing to rise for another decade and a half, unless further radical policy action is taken,” said Michael Liebreich, chairperson of Bloomberg New Energy Finance's advisory board.
Overall, around $12.2 trillion will be invested in global power generation between 2015 and 2040. Renewables will account for two thirds of that, while $1.6 trillion will be spent on coal, $1.2 trillion on gas and $1.3 trillion on nuclear.
Fossil fuels will account for 44 percent of world power generation in 2040, down from 67 percent in 2014.
Natural gas will not be the main transition fuel to wean the world off coal, the report said. Coal-to-gas switching will mainly take place in the United States, while developing nations will use both coal and renewables.
New investment in solar capacity should rise to $179 billion in 2040 from $136 billion last year, as the cost of photovoltaic (PV) technology continues to fall.
Small-scale solar capacity, such as rooftop or local PV systems, is seen rising to nearly 1.8 terawatts in 2040 - 17 times more than the current 104 gigawatts - due to a 47 percent crash in the cost of solar projects per megawatt as new materials and more streamlined production methods improve conversion efficiency.

Edmonton Oilers left wing Taylor Hall, who has missed the past 19 games with a cracked bone in their lower leg, was no longer wearing a non-contact jersey during practice Friday.
Hall, who was rotating with Andrew Miller on a line with Anton Lander and Ryan Hamilton, is questionable to play against the Philadelphia Flyers at Rexall Place on Saturday.
Oilers coach Todd Nelson said a decision on Hall will be made in the morning.
"We'll make a decision collectively as a staff and with Taylor on what we will do moving forward," Nelson told the Oilers website. "He's been out for a while and it's one thing to skate in practice and another to skate in a game. We haven't made a concrete decision where they will play, that's something we'll discuss as a group. But first and foremost we have to make sure he's healthy."
Hall sustained a bone bruise in their foot at their first practice after the NHL All-Star Game. They missed three games, then re-injured the foot against the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 2, and has been out ever since.
The Oilers have lost 15 of 19 games in Hall's absence.
"It's tough to get to 100 percent without playing in games," Hall said. "You can bag yourself as much as you want in practice, but it just seems like you just can't relax as easy and you can't have those breaks like you do in practice. So no matter if I practiced for two weeks more, then came into a game, I'd still be tired the first few shifts."
Christians' Criticism of Islam
One note about right wing Christian nutjobs who feel threatened by any member of the society who is not heterosexual, male or white, is that as much as they hate Muslims for their faith and support discriminating against them on the basis of their illusions, they would be recruited by Taliban had they were born in Pakistan. Christian fundamentalists don't hate Islam because it's pathetic and despotic, they hate it because Christian dogma teaches them intolerance. If they sincerely hated pathetic and despotic beliefs they wouldn't be called “Christians” in the first place. They advocate discrimination against Muslims because of the unfortunate event that their (i.e. Muslims') accident of birth took place in an Islamic family. Furthermore as a general rule, competing death cults don't look at each other favourably.
Having made that clear however, most of the criticism of Islam by Christians is valid and sound, but they form such arguments with a bias towards their own faith. That is to say, they would have no problem in recognising contradictions and violence in Islam, although they would deny it if one were to argue that such absurdities also exist in Christianity.
Now a question that a non-believer might ask would be:
“Is it rational to defend one dangerous religion in order to weaken a more dangerous one?”
Although this might seem to be a reasonable reaction, I just can't see how one can be on the side of Christian fundamentalists and follow what they seem to find to be aligned with their faith and not unjustly discriminate against people of other faiths or no faith at all. Christianity is not the right defense against Islamofascism, secularism however is.

Japan Times reports:
Protracted exposure to low-level radiation is associated with a significant increase in the risk of leukemia, according to a long-term study published Thursday in a U.S. research journal.
The study released in the monthly Environmental Health Perspectives was based on a 20-year survey of around 110,000 workers who engaged in cleanup work related to the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in 1986.
Scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine in Ukraine were among those who participated in the research.
***
Keigo Endo, a radiologist and president of Kyoto College of Medical Science, pointed to previous data showing an increased risk of leukemia with cumulative radiation exposure of as low as 120 millisieverts.
“The latest finding underlines the importance of long-term followup surveys. Further details of the survey should be examined to confirm specific dose levels that could cause leukemia,” Endo said.

TO MOST PEOPLE, WALT DISNEY PRODUCTIONS' ROBIN HOOD (1973) IS EITHER A FONDLY REMEMBERED CHILDHOOD TREAT OR ONE OF THE MANY DEATH KNELLS OF THE DISNEY ANIMATION EMPIRE... BOTH THOUGHTS ARE UNDERSTANDABLE.
MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MISTAKING THE SHIFT IN OVERALL ANIMATION QUALITY THAT CAME AFTER WALT DISNEY'S DEATH IN 1965. WHILE WALT WAS CERTAINLY MANY THINGS, They Are STILL AN INNOVATOR; SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT TECHNOLOGICAL INVESTMENT IN QUALITY ANIMATION WAS JUST AS MUCH A PART OF YOUR FILM'S SOUL AS THE THEMATIC SPIRIT ITSELF. AND LIKE MANY GREAT PRODUCERS THAT HAD REAL VISION, They UNDERSTOOD HOW TO BE AN ASSURED GUIDE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF FILMMAKING IN ORDER TO HELP A COLLABORATIVE TEAM REACH A BEAUTIFUL END RESULT. HECK, WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE OUT Their INTERESTING SHORT-STORY-FOCUSED SLEW OF FILMS FROM 1943-1949, YOU GET A LIFETIME RUN COMPRISED OF: SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, FANTASIA, DUMBO, BAMBI, CINDERELLA, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, PETER PAN, LADY AND THE TRAMP, SLEEPING BEAUTY, 101 DALMATIONS, SWORD IN THE STONE AND FINALLY THE JUNGLE BOOK (HE PASSED AWAY DURING THE FILM'S COMPLETION). LOOKING OVER THOSE TITLES, YOU REALIZE THAT IS AS GOOD A RUN AS ONE CAN HAVE.
BUT THEN CAME THE TWENTY-YEAR RUN AFTER Their DEATH (1968 TO 1988) IN WHICH WE GOT A RANDOM SPOTTING OF FILMS INCLUDING: THE ARISTOCATS, ROBIN HOOD, THE MANY ADVENTURES OF WINNIE THE POOH, THE RESCUERS, THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE BLACK CAULDRON, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE AND OLIVER AND COMPANY. IT'S A GROUP OF MOVIES THAT RANGE FROM THE CHARMING TO THE UNDERWHELMING, BUT IT'S NO ACCIDENT THEY ALL BARED THE UNFORTUNATE HALLMARKS OF CHEAPER ANIMATION, SHORTER RUN-TIMES AND SPARING FOCUS ON THAT UNMISTAKABLE DISNEY MANTRA. AND THE BRAND WOULD NOT TRULY RECOVER THEIR PRESTIGE UNTIL THE EARLY '90S RUN (STARTING WITH 1989'S THE LITTLE MERMAID). BUT OF ALL THE FILMS IN THAT LACKLUSTER TWENTY YEARS, THERE IS ONE FILM THAT STICKS OUT TO HULK FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. NOT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF HULK'S FAVORITES AS A YOUNGIN, BUT BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS A REALLY COMPELLING AND RARE ETHOS IN THE MIDST OF THIS INTERESTING META-NARRATIVE.
THAT WOULD BE 1973'S ROBIN HOOD.
AT THE TIME, THE POSTHUMOUS WALT DISNEY PRODUCTIONS WAS COMING OUT OF THE PERCEIVED FAILURE OF THE ARISTOCATS. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T DO THAT POORLY AND WAS ACTUALLY RECEIVED SOMEWHAT POSITIVELY, IT WAS STILL A FILM THAT "PROVED" TO THE PUBLIC AND THE TOP BRASS OF THE COMPANY THAT THEY COULDN'T CAPTURE THAT UNIQUE DISNEY MAGIC WITHOUT WALT HIMSELF. GRANTED, THE STUDIO'S ANIMATION DEPARTMENT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN FIGHTING BUDGET BATTLES FOR YEARS (AS PEOPLE HAD Troubled SEEING THE HIGH COSTS OF PRODUCTION AS AN INVESTMENT IN THE CULTURE), AND WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF WALT, IT LEFT THE FUTURE OF DISNEY ANIMATION IN SHAMBLES. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STAPLES OF WALT'S "NINE OLD MEN" LIKE JACK KINNEY, WILFRED JACKSON AND CLYDE GERONIMI HAD LONG SINCE LEFT. THUS, IT ALL FELL ON THE SHOULDERS OF WOLFGANG REITHERMAN TO CARRY ON THE LEGACY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT They FOUND Their BUDGETS AND STAFF WERE DRAMATICALLY CUT BACK. THE CREATIVE TEAM AROUND HIM WAS COMPLETELY HAMSTRUNG WITH THE STUDIO'S MANDATE OF THE EVER-POPULAR AND ASININE THEORY OF "DOING MORE WITH LESS." BUT LUCKILY FOR US, HAVING TO OPERATE IN THAT SPACE CREATED ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND SOULFUL FILMS IN THE DISNEY CANON.
THE PRODUCTION OF ROBIN HOOD IS SOMEWHAT FAMOUS FOR ITS LACK OF ACTUAL PRODUCTION. THE ANIMATORS WERE REGULARLY FORCED TO CUT MAJOR SEQUENCES, INCLUDING MOST OF THE FILM'S CLIMAX. THEY WERE ALSO FORCED INTO RECYCLING FULL-ON ANIMATION SEQUENCES FROM PRIOR DISNEY FILMS LIKE SNOW WHITE, THE JUNGLE BOOK AND EVEN ITS DIRECT PREDECESSOR THE ARISTOCATS (YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE ONE OF THE ARISTOCAT CHARACTERS DANCING BY THE CAMPFIRE, NOT EVEN REDRAWN). HECK, THEY EVEN HAD TO RE-USE MUCH OF THE FILM'S OWN ANIMATION FOR A SEEMINGLY ENDLESS-YET-SORT-OF-CHARMING OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE; ALL PART OF A SERIES OF GESTURES WHERE THEY WERE DESPERATELY TRYING TO STRETCH THE FILM TO 80 MINUTES.
AND YET EVEN WITH ALL THESE IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES, WHAT HULK LIKES TO ARGUE IS THAT ROBIN HOOD IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF SHOWING US WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN MOVIES. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS ISN'T AN ARGUMENT FOR TAKING AWAY THE LOVELY FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND INNOVATION WHICH DRIVE THE INDUSTRY, BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY PROOF OF WHAT YOU CAN DO SIMPLY WITH THE POWER OF CHARACTER, PERFORMANCE, SEQUENCING AND CHARM.
FOR ONE THING, IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR HULK TO PICK A FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THIS FILM. THEIR VERSION OF ROBIN HOOD IS NOT JUST THE CHARMING, UNFLAPPABLE ROGUE, BUT SO MUCH MORE A GENTLE AND MELANCHOLY MAN; A MAN WHOSE WEARY EXPLOITS ARE CATCHING UP WITH HIM, AND A WISTFUL, LONGING DESIRE IN Their HEART FOR A LOST LOVE. WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT SUCH CHARACTERIZATION IS HOW IT GETS ALL THIS ACROSS IN MERE LINES OF DIALOGUE. OFTEN THOSE LINES ARE EXCHANGED WITH LITTLE JOHN, THE BIG, BOISTEROUS BEAR WITH A SLIGHT N'AWLINS DRAWL WHO SOMEHOW EXISTS IN THIS SAME WORLD WITHOUT OUR BATTING AN EYE. OR HOW IT DOES THE SAME WITH LADY KLUCK AND Them BURLY SCOTTISH BROGUE. OR WITH MAID MARIAN WHO TRANSCENDS THE STOCK FEMININE NOTIONS OF SENSITIVITY AND KINDNESS INTO AN AUDREY HEPBURN-LIKE GRACE. OR THE HILARITY OF PRINCE JOHN'S HOPELESS KINGLY POSTURING COUPLED WITH Their WILDLY CHILDISH TEMPER TANTRUMS ("I HAVE A DIRTY THUMB"); WHICH THEN COUPLES AGAIN WITH THE PRINCE'S YES-MAN IN SIR HISS THE SNAKE. HULK IS HARD-PRESSED TO THINK OF A MORE HILARIOUS VILLAIN DUO WHOSE INSECURITY AND LACK OF SPINE STILL ACTUALLY MANIFEST IN REAL DANGER / STAKES FOR THE GOOD CHARACTERS. WHICH IS BRILLIANT, REALLY, BECAUSE UNLIKE SO MANY OTHER STOCK VILLAINS, THEIR EVIL IS A CASUAL, INSIDIOUS AND REAL EVIL. IT IS THE BASIC EXPRESSION OF SELFISH CALLOWNESS AND PETTINESS THAT MANIFESTS IN THE REAL WORLD. AND WHO BETTER TO THROW INTO THOSE GRAVE STAKES THAN THE FILM'S PLETHORA OF ADORABLE CHILDREN, WHO READILY MAKE TRUE OF THE OLD ADAGE OF AUDIENCE INVESTMENT ("TAKE SOMETHING YOU LIKE AND PUT IT IN REAL DANGER"). YUP, EVERY CHARACTER ONLY SEEMS TO HAVE A FEW LITTLE BITS OF SCREEN TIME AND YET EVERY CHARACTER COMES TO LIFE WITH SUCH VIVID HUMANITY.
YOU'LL ALSO PROBABLY NOTE HOW THE FILM SEEMS TO ALMOST FLOAT FROM SCENE TO SCENE, OFTEN FOLLOWING ONE CHARACTER INTO A NEW LOCALE ALL BEFORE FADING AND JUMPING TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STORY. RARELY DOES IT FEEL ALL THAT STRATEGIC, BUT MORE OF A CONCENTRATED FAIRY TALE-LIKE EFFECT THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANT NOTION OF CINEMATIC SEQUENCING. STRING A MOVIE ALONG IN CHUNKS, LET US CHEW OVER ONE SCENE IN FULL AND LOVING EFFECT, AND WE'LL HAPPILY SKIP OVER LARGE SECTIONS OF THE DRAMATIC CONSTRUCTS THAT REALLY DON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH MORE THAN SIMPLE EXPLANATION (LOOK AT THE WAY KUBRICK AND TARANTINO CONSTRUCT MOVIES IN FIVE-ACT CHUNKS OF SEQUENCES). WHAT'S STRANGE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS AFRAID TO DO THIS, BUT IT IS EXACTLY WHAT EDITING IS. WE DON'T NEED TO SHOW CHARACTERS DRIVING AROUND DOING NOTHING. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOOD AT FILLING IN GAPS. AND IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH GREAT STORIES UNDERSTAND THAT "DOING NOTHING" IS SO MUCH MORE OF THE STORY THAN ONE WOULD THINK. AND HECK, THIS FILM EVEN HAD TO CUT AN ENDING WITH KING RICHARD'S TRIUMPHANT DRAMATIC RETURN, BUT IT STILL KNOWS HOW TO SKATE BY WITH A MOMENTARY ESCAPE AND A TACKED-ON STORIFIED CONCLUSION. AND WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THE FILM IS WE PERHAPS INSTINCTIVELY UNDERSTAND ALL THIS BECAUSE THE FILM TELLS US IMMEDIATELY IN THE NARRATION: "OH, INCIDENTALLY, I'M ALAN-A-DALE, A MINSTREL. THAT'S AN OLD TIME FOLK SINGER. MY JOB IS TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS, OR WAS, OR WHATEVER."
THE WHATEVER SHOWS HOW THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH IS SO MUCH MORE COMPELLING.
BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY LOVELY THINGS ABOUT ROBIN HOOD IN THESE SEQUENCES. MOMENTS THAT LET A SMALL, INTIMATE WORLD OFTEN FEEL LARGE AND UNWIELDY. AND JUST HOW THE BIG STUFF FEELS EQUALLY INTIMATE. WE CAN WONDER INTO A SCENE AND MEET A NEW CHARACTER (LIKE THE CHURCH MICE) AND UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW IN JUST A FEW SECONDS. AND SO MUCH OF THE TONAL EXPLANATION COMES FROM THE FILM'S FAMOUS USE OF MUSIC, SPECIFICALLY A FEW ROGER MILLER SONGS THAT HAVE GONE ON TO BECOME EARWORMS FOR FOUR DECADES FOR A DAMN REASON (HINT: IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE AMAZING). BUT WHAT HULK WANTS TO POINT OUT IS THAT THOSE SONGS ARE NOT THE SUBJECT OF FOLKSY WISDOM, THEY ARE EXPRESSIONS OF THE MOVIE'S REAL DARKER ETHOS...
THE FILM IS ABOUT TRYING TO BE A GOOD PERSON IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
THINK ABOUT THE PLOT ITSELF: KING RICHARD HAS GONE TO THE HOLY LAND TO FIGHT A CRUSADE AND HAS THUS LEFT THEM WITH PRINCE JOHN, THE HORRIBLE PHONY-KING OF ENGLAND, A SURE-FIRE EXPRESSION OF THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW DISNEY PRODUCTION AND COMBATING THE PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE. MEANING IT'S NO ACCIDENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FILM'S SCENES SHOWCASE PRINCE JOHN AND THE SHERIFF TAKING AWAY ALL THE CITIZENS' MONEY IN INCREASINGLY CALLOUS WAYS. TO BOOT, AND THIS IS PURELY ANECDOTAL, BUT THESE CHARACTERS ARE LONG RUMORED TO BE BASED ON DONN TATUM AND CARD WALKER, WHO WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST PURE BUSINESSMEN TO BE BROUGHT IN TO RUN THE DISNEY EMPIRE AT THE TIME. AS SUCH, THEY DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF INVESTING IN ANIMATION AS A LONG-TERM GOAL. THEY SAW THE LEGACY AS BEING ENOUGH FOR THE FUTURE AND EVENTUALLY SPENT MOST OF THEIR TENURE WORKING ON DISNEY WORLD AND EPCOT CENTER. AND THAT LEFT THE ANIMATORS, OUR PROVERBIAL RESIDENTS OF NOTTINGHAM AND SHERWOOD FOREST, SCROUNGING FOR EVERY LAST FARTHING, TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY CAN. EVEN WHEN BOUND IN CHAINS, THEY ARE TRYING NOT TO LET THE OMNIPRESENT SADNESS BREAK THEIR SPIRIT.
IN THAT WAY, IT OFTEN FEELS LIKE THE MOST DOUR AND MELANCHOLY DISNEY UNIVERSE THAT HULK CAN THINK OF. AS ROGER MILLER SINGS, "EVERY TOWN / HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS / SOMETIMES THE UPS / OUTNUMBER THE DOWNS / BUT NOT IN NOTTINGHAM" AND IT IS REFLECTIVE OF A CREATIVE TEAM THAT REALLY, TRULY FELT LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE END OF THE RUN. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT HIM IN THE STORY ITSELF, BUT THEY KNEW KING RICHARD WOULDN'T BE COMING BACK IN THE REAL LIFE VERSION. A THOUGHT THAT SEEMS TO HANG OVER EVERYTHING.
IN POPULAR CONNOTATION, ROBIN HOOD IS MOSTLY REMEMBERED FOR ITS MUSIC, OR FOR BEING THE MOVIE THAT MADE A BUNCH OF FOLKS Has CONFUSING FEELINGS ABOUT FOXES (WHICH IS COOL. YOU DO YOU), BUT IT ABSOLUTELY REMAINS ONE OF HULK'S FAVORITE FILMS. AND THE THING THAT STILL STICKS TO HULK AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IS HOW MUCH OF IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE INESCAPABLE FEELING OF DOOM. BUT IT IS ALSO PERHAPS THE FIRST FILM THAT TAUGHT HULK THAT, YES, DOOM IS SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF, SOMETHING TO BE RESENTED, SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU SAD IN YOUR BONES...
BUT IT CAN NEVER BE A THING THAT CHANGES WHO YOU ARE.
LONG LIVE KING RICHARD.
<3 HULK
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 22, 2015:
An unsuccessful attempt to evade from paying the full price for 10 packets of Milo, by hiding the items into two empty boxes meant for mineral water, landed a youth into trouble with the law.
Muhammad Habbas Mohamed Jalil, 18, pleaded guilty today for stealing the Milo packets, worth RM395.90, from Tesco Extra Selayang in Jalan Ipoh around 4.30pm on Dec 18.
They were charged under Section 380 of the Penal Code that provides a maximum 10 years in jail, and a fine, if convicted.
According to the facts of case, the accused had visited the supermarket with two other friends on the day of the incident.
Muhammad Habbas was reportedly pushing around an empty trolley before placing two boxes of mineral water on it.
The 18-year-old youth then emptied the boxes of mineral water and hid 10 packets of Milo into the brown coloured boxes to evade from paying the full price.
At the check-out counter, a supermarket staff scanned the barcodes for the mineral water. The accused paid only RM17.98 for the items worth RM395.90.
However, they were later apprehended by the supermarket's staff.
Despite pleading guilty to the charge, magistrate Husna Dzulkifly did not hand down a sentence today pending the youth's social report due to their young age.
The court later imposed RM4,000 bail in one surety and fixed Jan 26 for re-mention.
We don't want to read too much into this, since this video only has 3800 views on a Youtube channel which was just started, but just the fact that these issues are being discussed in this election cycle speaks volumes.
And the applause Trump keeps getting when they say the US should fix relations with Russia are real.
It features Stephen Cohen, the most authoritative critic of Obama's neocon Russia policy
One sees the same thing with Alex Jones. They keep banging away on the theme that hostility towards Russia is a New World Order plot to throw the planet into war. That line is very popular.
Two million Americans tune in to Alex Jones each week. They have a bigger audience than MSNBC.
From Eric Zuesse via Zerohedge:
Clearly, this is the first Presidential contest since 1932 in which the interests of the aristocracy versus the interests of the public will be presented to the voters, for them to decide which of the two sides they're actually on. And, if the election turns out to be between Trump versus Sanders, then this will be the first U.S. Presidential election ever in which both of the major-Party nominees will have committed themselves to policies (Trump clearly on foreign affairs, Sanders clearly on domestic affairs) that the aristocracy vigorously oppose, and that presents a severe threat to the aristocrats' continued rule of the country.
Grab some popcorn. Russia Insider is going to have a field day in this election cycle.
Hi, this is Zaelia from Team Dignitas, the latest addition to the Heroes of the Storm team. This is my guide on how I like to play and build Tracer for Hero League. If you are new to Tracer, this build is probably not for you yet, because it is a little mechanically demanding and will require you to be somewhat comfortable with them already. This is basically the standard build that I would play in every game against anything, except for maybe their Level 1 talent, but we'll get into that later.
First, we'll get into the talents and the build, and then later we'll get into the early, mid, and late game playstyles.
TALENTS
So, Level 1, the go to is Pulse Strike, which increases your Pulse Bomb charge on Melee. You want to take this because it gives you so many bombs. You can just get your bombs super fast, you can even get 2 in one team fight, and your bomb is your main impact spell as Tracer.
You can also look into Tracer Rounds, which reveals on your auto-attack against stuff like Valeera, Greymane's Level 4 stealth, or any stealthies. It is also good for chasing around the bushes or against those who juke you around the bushes. Maybe if you are very focused on auto-attacking with a Tassadar, Tracer Rounds can also be fine.
Level 4 you basically always want to take Parting Gift. It adds a little bit of burst to your combo and, in general, is a lot of damage.
Level 7 is actually quite debatable between Jumper and Spatial Echo. Most people will take Spatial Echo, granting you Blinks after takedowns, but I prefer (by a very large margin, actually) Jumper, as it gives you 4 Blink charges. Throughout the whole game you will benefit from having that one extra charge, but Spatial Echo will only help you in certain situations.
Level 10 is always going to be Quantum Spike. The 10% additional damage is so huge and it also allows you to just kill tanks. You don't really need utility in your kit, you just need the most possible damage output in the small timing windows that you are going to have.
Level 13 you will always want to take Bullet Spray. It gives you wave clear, gives you more reliable poke, and it will synergize really well with your Level 20 talent later on.
Level 16 we have our Locked and Loaded, which will always be better. In basically every scenario, you will want to take and play Locked and Loaded if you can. If it disrupts you in your play and you cannot hit your reload every time, Sleight of Hand is your second best option here, as it gives you more bombs faster, but I really don't believe it's even close to the value of Locked and Loaded if you can use it properly.
Level 20 you always wanna go for Get Stuffed!. Not only does it reduce the cooldown of your Melee, increasing your waveclear, and poke potential significantly, it also gives you the ability to blow up your bomb instantly, which makes it so that neither your target nor the enemy support can react to it, leaving them dead!
GENERAL PLAYSTYLE
The playstyle of Tracer on their own is sort of a Sniper role. They get in, they get out, they have to be cautious, she's super squishy. But, when paired with something like a Tassadar, they turn into more of a Carry role where you rely more on your auto-attacks and you rely more on being up in their face actually pulling hero damage numbers for your team. It's kind of the Valla playstyle, where you just auto-attack everybody, because you are no longer squishy, you are one of the most annoying heroes to deal with, and you turn into this deadly combination that will just win you games outright.
EARLY GAME
In the early game, right out the gates, what you want to look for is charging your bomb. You took your Level 1 talent, Pulse Strike, which increases your bomb charge from slapping enemy heroes. So, you just want to look to slap some people in the face with your Melee. When you have your bomb before Level 10, it's very, very easy to confirm a kill on a side lane or when catching someone on a rotation. You can do that solo or just follow your tank around. They stun for you and you get out your bomb and kill confirmed. Just in general, showing up in lanes, even if you don't get a gank, reminds the enemy that you are there. So, after you've been showing up a few times, you can just actually stay hidden and they will be scared of you the whole game.
MID GAME
In the mid game, when the enemy starts to get ultimates and Ice Blocks, all of a sudden you have a lot more things to worry about when trying to get your kills. So, we're more turning into a role that creates space more than kills. You need to control vision points, you need to force out some cooldowns, and then you can go for your kills. It's basically the same playstyle but you just need to be more patient and more teamwork-oriented. Creating space is more your role now.
LATE GAME
More towards the late game, you get your Level 16 talent, Locked and Loaded, and it allows you to actually do damage to tanks. So when you're poking and fighting, you mostly wanna look at just drilling down the tanks. If you have your Locked and Loaded, you will do really, really good damage to tanks and when you have your Level 20 talent, Get Stuffed!, you can just poke down a tank, force out a mistake, and blow them up immediately. So you no longer have to be so much in and out, you can really just dance around them and do tons of damage with your auto-attacks. But while you're melting their tanks, your main focus is to get a pick on a squishy and it remains like that throughout the rest of the game.
Thanks for reading! Tracer is really one of my favourites. They have an enormous potential for surprising and big impact plays.

Once upon a time, about two months ago, we created a tool that would tell you who was leading in the presidential primaries at this point in 2004, 2008 and 2016. We even made a little Twitter account, @pastfrontrunner, which every morning would tweet out an update on who it was that was leading at that point in the race.
For people who weren't enthusiastic about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the nomination, it was some small consolation: Look at the diversity of weirdos who at some point had led their or their party's nomination race!
Well, now a large number of people would like some consolation that Trump won't win the general election, and we are here to oblige. Granted, the fact that past primaries wobbled and weaved didn't end up meaning a whole lot in terms of what would happen this year, but, nonetheless: Perspective is always nice to have.
So we pulled data from the RealClearPolitics polling average for 2004, 2008 and 2012 — and, for good measure, what we've got so far this year.
This is how George W. Bush-John Kerry, Barack Obama-John McCain and Obama-Mitt Romney looked, with Hillary Clinton-Trump as a dollop of whipped cream on top.
As of Thursday, there were 180 days until the election. Of the 540 days that made up the last 180 days of the past three races, the person who ended up winning led in 79 percent of them. There's some back-and-forth — but the person who wins has led pretty consistently. Clinton's lead in the most recent Real Clear Politics average, 6.4 points, was exceeded by past winners only 6 percent of the time. It's a big lead, in other words.
But, then, past experience suggested that Trump's lead in the primaries would collapse, and we saw what happened there. So, as of right this minute, whenever you read this between now and Nov. 8, here's how the past contests stood.
We're talking about only three elections here. So don't be surprised if your hopes and dreams are crushed, as usual.

Razer's new range of StarCraft II peripherals includes the Banshee headset, Spectre mouse and a keyboard called the Marauder. The feature Razer is most keen to shout about is the APM (actions per minute) lighting system. Each peripheral bristles with lights that glow different colours, depending on how many key presses and mouse clicks you make.The lights can also indicate if you're under attack, and you can independently customise the lighting system of each peripheral using Razer's StarCraft II Configurator. We'll investigate each peripheral to find out if they're any good, or just a package of flashing lights and gimmickry.The Spectre mouse has a 2.1m braided cable and thumb buttons, and the StarCraft II Configurator software offers a huge number of tweaking options. Each of the five buttons is programmable, and you can add up to five sensitivity settings between 100 and 5,600dpi.However, the only way to toggle between sensitivities, other than allocating this function to the finger or thumb buttons, is by using a switch on the underside of the mouse. There are also options that enable you to adjust the acceleration and the USB polling rate to 125Hz, 500Hz or 1,000Hz. Plus, you can create profiles and macros too, assigning each to a specific button.The Spectre isn't very comfortable to use, however. The symmetrical, angular shape didn't fit comfortably in our hands, and there were points in the shell at the rear that dug into our palms. The mouse feels very narrow too, although the mouse pointer at least moved in a smooth and predictable way.We were heartened to see that the Razer Spectre wasn't just an already existing product with stickers applied. Razer seems to have genuinely worked on creating a mouse that looks unique and ties in closely to the game.Unfortunately, though, the Spectre only offers basic functions, and it's also pricey and uncomfortable to use due to its angular shape. Only the biggest StarCraft II fans should look at the Spectre; everyone else should consider either the CM Storm Inferno or the Mionix Naos 3200
Once again, from American Legion #308 in Reseda, California, Pro Wrestling Guerilla presents their tenth anniversary show TEN. As usual, Excalibur and their cast of characters is back on commentary.
Tonight, Joey Ryan returns and Anthony Nese debuts. Also, will Adam Cole and The Young Bucks get their comeuppance? Let's find out!
Joey Ryan, Peter Avalon, and Ryan Taylor v. Candice LeRae, Willie Mack, and B-Boy
This is the return of Joey Ryan to PWG after a nondescript run in TNA. For those that have followed PWG, you'll know this match is going to be an attempt to give an homage to the Joey Ryan/Candice LeRae terri-feud and Ryan and LeRae would be highlighted…and they were (along with Willie Mack). A few fun spots in this match, mostly featuring one of the asupervisorstioned three. Also, watch out for the dancing Asian guy on the front row, hard camera side. Lulz. Willie Mack will eventually pin Pretty Peter with the Chocolate Thunder Driver for the win. It was ok, it got the crowd up and would have been fun if you were there, and served its purpose. Sometimes in PWG, “you gotta be there” to enjoy a match for what is supposed to be and it's tough to appreciate from your living room and this was one of them. **1/2
Brain Cage v. Anthony Nese
Dammit man, Brian Cage still has shades of that Red Rooster faux hawk going on. This, I do believe is Tony Nese's debut in PWG. This is one of those matches you know exactly what you'll be getting — two top tier athletes with a display of athleticism and power moves. It starts off pretty sloppy and it's pretty clunky all the way through. Still, they get their shit in. There are some cool spots. Cage wins with the Weapon X. **
Forever Hooligans v. The RockNES Monsters
The crowd is pretty hype to see the Hooligans come to PWG. The IWGP Junior HW Tag Champs / ROH Tag Champs are a pretty hot commodity in their stateside tour. Johnny Yuma with a haircut, too. This one has a ton of comedy in it. The go-home got pretty serious though. They had the Monsters get a ton of offense in. Hooligans with the Contract Killer for the win. It was ok. **1/4+
Michael Elgin v. AR Fox
Consider me someone who looked forward to this match. I don't expect this to be a psychology display, but it is your token power guy versus flippy bastard faire. So, there is sure to be a ton of fun shit here. This one starts off with both guys just getting some of their stuff in, but about mid-way through, it heats up and both guys want to beat the shit out of each other. It's matches like this where you can fully appreciate how good a guy like Michael Elgin is because he's not just your token power guy. He's capable of working a ton of different styles and working with a variety of guys and having good to great matches. There is an awesome spot here (among many) where Elgin catches Fox doing their corner shooting star press, deadlifts him, and buckle bombs them in the corner. This will lead to Elgin hitting a sit down power bomb from the top fucking rope for the win. Really good. ***3/4
Intermission.
Chuck Taylor / Johnny Gargano v. Brian Kendrick / Paul London
Truth be told, I'm not a huge Kendrick or London fan at this point. I find their matches to be typically pretty uninspiring. That isn't to say they don't have one or two here and there that come through for me though. This is one of them. This match starts off with Gargano and Kendrick in a chicken fight. Hilarious. There is some comedy early on here, but the last five minutes or so get pretty intense. Taylor and Gargano reverse Slice Bread #2 on Kendrick and hit their finish. Pretty good. Better than usual Kendrick/London stuff of recent vintage. ***1/4
Kyle O'Reilly v. TJ Perkins
This is a battle of two very distinct styles, so it should be fun. American Strong Stylez versus the technical prowess of TJP. O'Reilly has been hot hot in PWG this year and was my dark horse pick to win Battle of Los Angeles this year. TJP usually holds up their end of the match. This one is put right in front of the double main event. This one is pretty nondescript, when sandwiched on this card, but it ends up being quite good. As you'd expect, crisp and fluid as most TJP matches end up being. Autoparts is the guy to watch here. The submission aspect of this match really adds the extra layer here. This is one of those matches that is pretty nondescript, so it holds it back a little bit, but it is a really good match. Going to be underrated. ****-
Adam Cole (c) v. Kevin Steen v. Drake Younger
This one is going to be Guerrilla Warfare Rulez! This is kind of a token conclusion to the year of booking. Cole took the belt off Steen. Cole defeats Younger with shenanigans. Steen has continued to feud with Cole. So, here we are. We open up with Cole getting the shit kicked out of him. The moment they get the upper hand, Cole goes to sit on a chair, and the chair falls apart. Lulz. Some fun spots here. Lots of insanity. Cole hits Panama Sunrise onto a table. Steen pulls Cole out immediate and hits them with an Apron Bomb. Package Piledriver on Younger through chairs. Steen hits a BRAINBUSTAH and Cole goes FLYING to the outside. Steen throws Cole back into the ring. Younger pulls Steen out, goes for the pin and Cole steals a pin on a reverse on Younger. Crowd chanting “BULLSHIT!” Overall, decent Guerilla Warfare match. ***1/2
The Young Bucks v. Inner City Machine Guns v. DojoBros
This one is a LADDER MATCH. The tag belts are hanging high in the air. Match starts out quick. Tons of group spots, flips out of the ring. You know, the fun stuff. Ladders get involves pretty damn quickly. There are a few normal ladders and then this monster skyscraper ladder (probably a 20-footer) that is higher up than the actual tag belts. LOL. This match has your smörgåsbord of huge spots. The Bucks retain while everyone gets superkicked multiple times. Pretty bananas. ****
The Buzz: Started slow, but finished strong.
Match of the Night: The Young Bucks v. Inner City Machine Guns v. DojoBros LADDER MATCH.
Also Check Out: Kyle O'Reilly v. TJ Perkins.
Next up: PWG The Battle of Los Angeles 2013. It's PWG's biggest event of the year. Last year, Adam Cole came away the victor and went on to become one of the Indies hottest heels. Who will emerge this year? Will it be the favorite, last year's runner-up, Michael Elgin? Will it be the Ultraviolent Golden Boy Drake Younger? Or will my dark horse candidate, the red hot Kyle O'Reilly emerge? Should be fun.

Review: Tank Battle: North Africa By Jeff Renaud
A few months ago this site reviewed HexWar Games' Tank Battle: 1944. Recently, the company released Tank Battle: North Africa (TB:NA) for Windows/PC, which, as one might surmise, takes the series' venue to the North African desert, where the player can both control and face fictionalised elements of the Deutsches Afrika Korps. As far as I can tell – not having played 1944 or any of its Mac/iOS siblings – not a lot has changed other than the scenery and the virtual toys one gets to play with. Which is not a negative; what HexWar does it do well, ‘filling a niche' as our previous review suggested, between the complexities of Matrix titles and certain others from the likes of Paradox Interactive and Creative Assembly.
Speaking of scenery, the game's graphics are quite respectable: Hills and palm groves dot the desert, across which tanks leave temporary tread-marks; mud-brick buildings line rough roads; minefields, wire, and other fortifications menace suitably detailed unit models. A PzII looks quite different from a Tiger, both of which are easily distinguishable from a Crusader II or Sherman, for example. Along with the usual infantry and artillery pieces, halftracks, jeeps, and trucks also figure prominently.
Graphics settings only feature HD enabled/disabled as well as maximum 2560x1080, but there aren't too many scenarios where the size of your screen will matter a great deal, as most battles play out on hex-grids as small as 9x10. Action can be zoomed – a feature 1944 lacked – which, despite the size of most scenarios, is good considering that AI-initiated combat doesn't auto-centre, and nearly everything happens at once during the AI turn. Thus, a player is advised to zoom all the way out before ending one's turn, as a lot might otherwise be missed.
I hope I can win a little glory…
THIS AIN'T ROCKET SCIENCE…
Tank Battle: North Africa offers six fictional campaigns of eight scenarios each, plus a Bonus. Although the player doesn't have a core force to carry through, instead starting with a different unit mix each time, the ability to play the Axis (German) side as well as the Allies (U.S./U.K.) is featured, albeit not by choice. The game makes little effort to reflect historical continuity, much less ‘real' battles, save for the occasional mention of places like Djebel Abiod, for example.
Even so, I found virtually all scenarios engaging enough and reasonably well-balanced on ‘Standard' difficulty, albeit a few gave me a hard enough time I had to go ‘Casual' in order to move things along. Higher difficulty, including ‘Hard', seems to either favour the AI in battle and/or impose negative modifiers on the player. However, it's hard (sorry!) to tell, because the ‘Combat Analysis' – which pops up on targeting but can still be toggled on/off from the main screen – doesn't change. Therefore, a given encounter can allow a unit the same number of ‘shots', each with the same percentage chance to hit, in spite of the Difficulty setting. (Testing the same two units in the same scenario at all three Difficulties indicated such to me, at least.)
Other combat modifiers include the usual, i.e., armoured and soft targets, weapon type – machine gun, rifle, howitzer, etc. – and cover/entrenchment penalties ‘to hit', plus range and terrain. In addition, Raw, Veteran, and Elite units get attack modifiers. All work together well, although AT guns occasionally seem a little too effective versus soft targets. Move/shoot order is very important in TB:NA, as taking advantage of a +2 Flanking bonus – to which all units are subject – is significant, especially because hard targets, at least, generally have weaker side and rear armour, something also factored into the combat equation. Thus, positioning a unit to shoot and, in effect, draw an enemy's attention, can permit others to get a flank attack against its more vulnerable facing(s), in addition to a greater chance to hit.
Tough tank; don't go after it with a Crusader II.
Key alongside these tactics is the requirement to move/shoot with one unit before moving the next, as there are no turns ‘phases' in TB:NA. Each unit can be moved in any order, but once it attacks, further movement with it is disallowed. Units are also subject to scoot 'n' shoot penalties, something else to factor in as well as range (stationary attackers logically being more accurate). Complicating these considerations is the way many scenarios feature terrain bottlenecks, where units will be unable to pass one another easily, as well as the fact that, for most, moving too far – or at all, for some like SPAT guns – means a lost attack for the turn. Powerful airstrikes, another tactical consideration because they can be saved and accumulated, are available in some scenarios, and can make quite a difference when all at once surrounded by superior forces.
I CAN GET INTO THAT!
Before all that, however, the game is very easy to get into, with a tutorial campaign supplemented by brief ‘How to Play' instructions accessed through the Help menu. Here, one can also learn the victory conditions: usually a higher score than your AI opponent (there is no hot-seat or multiplayer). One earns points through usual feats such as eliminating enemy units and taking objectives, modified by the Difficulty. High Score for each scenario is tracked, so players can try to outdo themselves; one to three medals are ‘awarded' on top of each scenario's title to indicate the level of victory, easily distinguishing which offer room for improvement. Instant defeat is possible, however, if one takes too long or incurs too many losses, or loses certain objectives. ‘Help' also offers various Charts to assist in preventing this outcome, including asupervisorstioned range modifiers for all featured weapons, as well as for terrain.
Other than the auto-centre issue mentioned above, I encountered few problems, all minor. First, although during the AI turn messages scroll in the upper left corner of the screen, and can now be clicked on to take one to the action, things happen so fast that they seldom seemed available long enough to take advantage; zoom out instead, as suggested above.
I'm glad I don't have to get out my calculator for this…
Though still relatively insignificant in such a short list of small annoyances, I found the Mounted/Dismounted icons most confounding; to me, they should indicate a unit's current mode, not the one they'll switch into once toggled. Likewise, on the button used to accomplish the switch, the truck and walking figure icons ought to be larger/smaller than one another, the larger ‘logically' indicating a unit's present mode.
While many players might more or less easily grow accustomed to such petty issues – not to mention that a unit's stance in open terrain or hills is obvious – it's not so simple to tell when they're undercover such as trees, which can almost completely hide certain units from player view. Thus, it becomes a consideration, since switching modes takes a turn, during which a unit cannot move or attack. (I did find it a little odd that, although mounted infantry cannot enter pillboxes or buildings, they can board their transport while indoors; but I suppose this is an abstraction.)
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BASS—ERRR… THE AI AND REPLAYABILITY…
As for the AI, it seems competent, the only anomaly I noticed being how it sometimes appeared to neglect to shoot at me; but I'm now certain this was because of the ‘move too far' rule. Although I at first questioned why the AI would do this – render certain units vulnerable by moving them too fast – it didn't seem to happen all that often, and after all, scouting is frequently advisable even for AI opponents (at least for those that don't cheat!). Finally, although the first few scenarios seemed a little repetitive, just as I began to think so I suddenly had more variety, including escorting a ‘wounded' unit; a meet in the middle slugfest; raiding supply dumps; a race to seize objective(s); as well as the usual attack/defend. While alternating reasonably well if played consecutively, one isn't constrained to play in any order (if ‘Unlock All Scenarios' is checked in the Settings menu). Furthermore, along with the chance to play different sides, the player is sometimes given the option in a particular scenario to conservatively defend or else go on the offensive. (Hmmm… What would Patton do…?) Plus, there are occasional ‘surprises' along the way, so boredom should not be an issue.
Whaddya mean, “Don't mind the mines”, sir?
In summary, though, I have to confess a little hesitation in recommending TB:NA unreservedly; for the very reason I admitted above, regarding my lack of experience with any other Tank Battle game, I would suspect some possible repetitiveness despite the ‘new' setting et al., if one has played others. Still, I imagine trying any one of them would quickly give a player a good idea how the rest might work for them or not; ‘variety' and ‘repetitiveness' being subjective, after all.
On the other hand, if you're a wargamer seeking a sprawling, operational WWII game, or one that rigourously models historicity and tactical realism, look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you're eager for a quick wargaming challenge where your tanks are engaged within a turn or two, and scenarios can generally be played inside an hour – albeit closing a game auto-saves it to Resume later – then Tank Battle: North Africa is probably for you. Especially if you enjoyed any of its kin, and considering its sub-$15 price tag.
On the heels of a report linking 77 earthquakes in Ohio to fracking, a Texas city in an area rife with drilling operations was hit with a wave of 11 earthquakes in 24 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. The most intense registered 3.6 on the Richter scale, well over the level at which people would feel it — the local 911 service received more than 300 calls from residents trying to figure out what was going on.
These recent quakes bring the total number to 26 since October in Irving, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. James Joiner reports at The Daily Beast that north Texas has seen more than a hundred quakes since 2008, when fracking operations began to ramp up, a dramatic increase from years previous.
Something similar is going on in neighboring Oklahoma, where, as we mentioned yesterday, there have been 586 earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater in just one year — the most of any state in the contiguous U.S. in 2014. Between 1975 and 2008, the state only got, on average, three earthquakes of this magnitude per year.
Scientists are pretty clear that Oklahoma's booming oil and gas industry holds a hefty chunk of the blame for the uptick in seismic activity. And now some residents of Irving — where, as it happens, ExxonMobil is headquartered — are asking questions too. From the Daily Beast article:
Irving itself has more than 2,000 [fracking] sites nearby, and some of the more than 216,000 state wide “injection wells” responsible for disposing of fracking's wastewater byproduct are in close proximity. Located thousands of feet below the ground, these wells hold millions of gallons of chemically tainted h2o, and … the pressure and liquid combination can combine to “lubricate” fault lines. And that may well be what is happening in the Barnett Shale region around, yes, Dallas and Irving. Barnett Shale is the largest land-based gas field in Texas, with an estimated 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas just waiting to be hammered out of the ground … It's a nearly bottomless potential bank account for corporations with the resources to drill and grind. But, as the people of Irving are now discovering, all of this poking and prodding is not without potential consequences.
Furthermore, seismologists warn that these drilling-related quakes have a good chance of getting worse than more and more wastewater is injected into to the ground. That's bad news for the folks in Irving, Texas (and in Oklahoma, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and Colorado … ).
Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union,” while commenting on Wikileaks releasing 20,000 emails that were stolen from the Democratic National Committee's servers that showed a bias for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former Obama administration green jobs czar Van Jones said it was an “insult” that Democratic National Committee chairperson Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) has not resigned.
Jones said, “I'm upset about a lot of stuff. Number one, I think the DNC leak is just a disaster. I think, you know, a chair has to be fair. If you're going to be the referee, be the referee, you can't put somebody else's jersey on. The fact that we are here on the verge of a convention to try to stop Donald Trump and we still have the same person in the chair is just an outrage. I just think that they should apologize, just apologize and resign. Number one. Number two, Robby Mook came out here on your program and they said something that was so unfair to all the young activists of color who were hoping that we might have a brown or a black nominee. They were like, oh, nobody feels that way. That's not true. There were people who were hoping for, you know, one of the Castro brothers or more a Perez or for a Cory Booker. Don't come here at the beginning of the convention and poo poo that and say, ‘oh, no, we are all happy.' Listen, people like Tim Kaine but give people a minute to have a moment of heart break. I'm just concerned that you've got a tone deaf DNC chair, Robbie should not have said that and I'm just worried that we are not respecting — you have 43 percent of the delegates coming here, they are Bernie Sanders people. They aren't all happy yet. We've got a lot of work to do and you can't insult people who have been trying to be a part of this process, leave that chair in place, that's an insult. Robby coming out here and saying that, that's an insult. Give us an opportunity to come together as a party.”

A King County sheriff's sergeant who was abruptly put on leave last year is at risk of being fired, a newly disclosed memo says, over conduct that included sending racist, anti-gay and sexually charged texts to colleagues.
A King County sheriff's sergeant is facing possible termination over conduct that included texts sent to two deputies containing racist, anti-gay and sexually charged comments, according to a newly disclosed sheriff's memorandum.
The texts surfaced as part of an internal investigation into a sex-discrimination claim filed last year by one of the deputies who received the texts, Amy Shoblom.
The sergeant, Dewey Burns, sent texts to Shoblom and the other deputy using slurs to refer to blacks, gay men, Mexicans and Chinese, some of whom they encountered at a poker room and a gym.
Referring to an assault suspect, Burns texted that they were “probably black” because “Usually violent ones are black dudes.” Burns also appeared to refer to another sergeant as a “Mexi” in their texting.
The texts also revealed that Burns, who worked in the Metro Transit division until they were abruptly put on leave late last year when Shoblom filed their claim, “abandoned their responsibilities as a supervisor” in August, according to the memorandum obtained Tuesday by The Seattle Times.
Burns, while on duty, drove to Covington in their patrol car when Shoblom asked for a ride home from a friend's apartment where they had been drinking, the memorandum said.
Burns stayed for one or two hours before following Shoblom to their home in Maple Valley, according to the memorandum.
“He would have no way to provide their deputies with supervisory oversight or emergency backup,” the memorandum said. “As a patrol supervisor, their actions that night compromised the security services for transit.”
The internal investigation also found Burns and Shoblom engaged in “longstanding sexualized text messaging,” which at times Shoblom initiated and encouraged.
The memorandum concurred with the finding of an outside attorney, hired by the sheriff's office, that Shoblom wasn't offended by the texts, which included sexually provocative photographs and images.
But it was Burns who violated “supervisory expectations,” the memorandum said.
Sheriff John Urquhart met Monday with Burns and their attorney, Robert Christie, to discuss the internal investigation, which recommended Burns be fired.
Urquhart said in an email that it wouldn't be appropriate to talk in detail about the proceedings, but that Burns and Christie provided sworn affidavits from three Metro Transit employees regarding Burns' “character, work ethic, and their experience with them interacting with minorities.”
Christie also presented a text message, sent by Shoblom, in which they used a racial epithet, Urquhart said. “We had not seen this particular text before. That will now be investigated,” Urquhart wrote.
Christie, in an interview Tuesday, said that a good friend of Burns who is of Mexican descent spoke on their behalf at the meeting, and that Burns has a stellar record on the job in their dealings with the public and Metro, including minorities.
“He's not proud they used those words and took full responsibility that those were completely inappropriate,” Christie said of the 16-year veteran who, they added, received high marks in their 2014 job evaluation.
Urquhart, whose office reviewed hundreds of pages of texts, said after the meeting that they sustained misconduct allegations relating to Burns' inappropriate relationship with a subordinate “as evidenced by the text messages,” as well as for the racial and anti-gay comments.
“I find all to be unacceptable and the sexually charged banter, racial and gay comments to be particularly beyond the pale,” they said in the email. “Absolutely unacceptable for a public servant.”
Urquhart said they still are weighing whether to sustain another allegation against Burns involving discrimination and harassment of Shoblom. The memo describes them using hand sanitizer to draw the image of a penis on their patrol car.
Urquhart said they would review Burns' personnel, internal-investigations and commendation record as part of the due diligence they are required to conduct before making a disciplinary decision in about a week.
Shoblom's attorney, Julie Kays, said Burns' activities were so “chronic and pervasive” that it was “almost a condition of employment” for Shoblom, who was “damned” no matter what they did.
“Remember, he's their boss,” Kays said.
Of the newly produced text in which Shoblom purportedly used an epithet, Kays said it was the first they had heard of the accusation and that they couldn't comment further.
Kays said they plan to soon file a sex-discrimination lawsuit on behalf of Shoblom and two gay deputies, Sgt. Diana Neff and Deputy Julie Blessum, who filed preliminary claims against King County late last year alleging sex discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Each asked for up to $3 million in damages.
The allegations have been called into question in detailed reports prepared by two outside attorneys, hired by the sheriff's office at a cost of about $89,600. While Burns' conduct was deemed improper by the attorney who looked into Shoblom's claim, the attorneys found no evidence of sex discrimination or hostile working conditions.
Some problems were attributed to poor communication skills by the commander who serves as police chief in Shoreline, where the sheriff's office provides police services under a contract. Urquhart said they have counseled the commander, Shawn Ledford.
Noting the outside attorneys were paid by King County, Kays accused the sheriff's office and King County of “trivializing complaints by three women who put on the badge every day and get out there to protect the rights of people in King County.”
Urquhart, in a statement, said using outside investigators is “a common practice for governments and business when their employees are accused of harassment or discrimination because it is a specialized legal area.”
Experts have a strong interest in their reputations to conduct fair investigations, Urquhart said, describing themselves as “absolutely confident” in the quality of their work.
“Kays seems to assume that employers only want to hear that their employees have not engaged in harassment or discrimination, rather than discover and root out a problem if it exists,” the sheriff's statement said. “It would be a disservice for an expert to mislead employers into erroneously thinking their employees are not engaged in harassment or discrimination when they are! That would do me and the taxpayers absolutely no good.”
One Week in Normandy - An Armoured Commander AAR By Sean Couture
I'm dead, again. This had easily been my longest run, but all good things must come to an end. My fate was delivered to me by the most terrifying of steel beasts. The Jagdpanther. But where are my manners? Stories have a beginning for a reason so let's wind back a few…
I first discovered Armoured Commander in the last quarter of 2016. A one-man project that's free to download, this game looks and sounds like something you needed a floppy disk to install onto your Amiga way back in the day. The combined size of all of its files is less than most emails! In it you command an M4 Sherman tank through post D-day Normandy, where life is hard and death lurks around every corner. The tank commander who bore my real name, Sean Couture, died two runs ago fighting alongside the Canadian 4th Armoured. Their stead, the Bullet Magnet, went up in a fiery explosion after he'd made the mistake of existing in the same area as a German Pak 40 AT gun.
Upon starting a campaign, you name your commander and your tank before then selecting the skills of your commander and crew. These skills are modifiers that have a percentage chance of activating when they take actions. For instance, the “cautious driver” skill means my tank has a chance to start an encounter in the hull down position, providing me with extra protection. Before deployment on each day you stock up your tank's general stores and ready rack with rounds. There will always be an infinite amount of They and AP to choose from, but rarer things like HCBI (smoke) and HVAP (High Velocity Armour-Piercing) are in limited supply so picking them up when you can is a good idea. It's also good to note that eventually should you reach the refit period you will be offered another form of Sherman to commandeer.
At the start of each day you are presented with a map of the area you will be moving through, each with a start zone and an exit zone. Your mission is to advance through the map capturing areas as you go; each area you capture and enemy you kill will net you VP (victory points) which are tallied up as your score when you either finish the campaign or die (most likely the latter). You can scout out the areas adjacent to the one you're in and the game will give you a report of what the resistance is like (light, medium or heavy). Reaching the exit before nightfall gains you extra VP.
Got the basics? Good! Let's get back to the story about my week in Normandy…
Day One
My first day of the Operation Cobra breakout went off without a hitch. Loaded up the newly christened The Black Orchid with just over fifty They round, around thirty AP and a couple WP (white phosphorus) for good measure. Our mission today was to simply advance alongside the rest of Patton's 4th Armoured Division so contact was light. With this being the first day the Germans were still in disarray, the largest thing we saw was a Puma armoured car that didn't really stand a chance once we'd closed in.
So far, so good!
Day Two
Our first real battle encounter. We were moving through a town when we happened upon some infantry, an Opel Blitz truck and a Panzer IV. Battle encounters are turn based and happen on a hex grid. There are three phases; spotting, order, and fire. In the spotting phase you pick one quadrant of the map to scout out all enemy units in that area, during the order phase you give orders to your crew and in the fire phase you...well, fire at the enemy – provided you didn't order your vehicle to move.
Thanks to my driver Billy “The Cautious Driver” Dorman and their handy “Cautious Driver skill” we started the encounter in the hull down position giving The Black Orchid some extra protection. With infantry being so close I told the crew to turn in and I got Alfred Fields, my loader, to switch the round out for AP and in the fire phase I mail two of them to the Panzer IV by way of the 75MM postal service. One hits, leaving it stunned. Meanwhile the abstracted friendly forces who accompany you everywhere (though they aren't shown on the map at all) manage to wipe out the infantry. Being stunned the Panzer IV doesn't return fire and the Opel Blitz...is an Opel Blitz. I fire again, this time killing the Panzer IV with a single AP round whilst my comrades “bravely” dispatch the Opel Blitz.
I breathe a sigh of release and congratulate myself on my first tank kill.
Day Three
One solitary tank kill probably doesn't sound like at that much. But you have to remember that I'm in an M4 Sherman. Not a Firefly, not a Jumbo or Sherman 105mm or one of the improved 76ers. I'm in command of one of the most out matched armoured fighting vehicles in 1944. So a kill on anything above light armour is a major win in my books. Day three goes by with me killing a Puma or two and feeling a little bad for using WP on an infantry section that got too close.
This isn't so bad, you know?
Day Four
One thing I've never really understood about Armoured Commander is how I'm supposed to tackle AT guns. In most of my other runs the appearance of a Pak 38 or 40 might as well have just been a death screen. If they're close enough you can kill them with a or two but if they are at long range they are a lot harder to deal with. Pulling a Fury and charging them will just get you killed faster and as far as I can tell you can't simply reverse out of battle encounters.
Suppressing them with smoke and closing in, or hoping that your comrades will kill them seem to be the two most viable options as far as I can tell. Of the two I ran into today I played no part in killing either. The first got picked off by a nearby infantry unit while the second killed three friendly tanks before attempting to run off and getting shot in the back by one of their vengeful comrades.
We live to fight another day, and I'm starting to get into my grove.
Day Five
I don't care if it's a tiny grey box. Jagdpanther's are scary. I run into one just one area away from the exit zone. It's accompanied by a Panzer IV and some infantry. I might as well pick up and throw my AP shells for the good they're doing right now. Before long I switch targets to the Panzer IV since I know I can hurt that and rack up my second armour kill.
I then pop smoke and scream at Billy to hull down. Before it leaves the Jagdpanther stuns me twice and kills two friendly tanks. On the upside, I fought a Jagdpanther and lived! But on the downside I've just been shown how little power I have comparatively.
Still, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel!
Day Six
Today's a little different. We're on a battle mission rather than an ‘advance' mission What's more, my tank has been made battle leader so I'll be getting a nice VP bonus by the end of this day. The game says resistance will be heavier than normal and encourages me to make use of airstrikes and artillery. I do so quite happily. My proudest moment of the day is when I manage to ambush a Panther and plant three AP rounds in its rear before it can even react. Disabled and facing the wrong way I quickly dispatch it in my next fire phase and thank the RNG gods for such favourable dice rolls.
Later on command sends me on a rescue mission to recover some downed pilots. I enter the area, a battle encounter triggers and one solitary enemy unit is spotted. Oh Nazi Germany, you shouldn't have! It's a Pak 40! And I've been ambushed, so they get to fire first.
“Hello darkness my old friend...” Their first shot takes out my tracks, their second stuns me. “...I've come to be with you again…” in their next turn they fire once and misses. Some nearby infantry pin him. I'm saved! I pop smoke and pray. They fire again, this time at another tank. No dice. Friendly infantry return fire, killing him. God bless those GIs! With that my day is done. With my track all shot up I can't make it to the exit zone and don't get the extra VP.
But I stared death in the face and lived. For the first time since I landed on their incredibly retro, pixelated scrap of war-torn France, I start to feel a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can win.
I can DO this.
Day Seven
I can't do this.
Billy's dead. The artillery we called in to suppress this area apparently had little effect on the Jagdpanther who just put an AP round through The Black Orchid's front armour. I have no proof it's the same one from Day Five but I'm damn sure it is. For the second time in as many days I'm immobilized, opposite a weapon designed specifically for killing tanks. I do the only thing I can do and throw every AP shell I have at it. Dylan fires off four, three of which land on target with the fourth going wide. Bounce, bounce and oh look, another bounce. The Jagdpanther returns fire with a solitary shell, confidant it won't need a third. It was right.
M4 Shermans became famous in WW2 for what crews called “brewing up”, where the whole tank would light up in a fantastic pillar of fire upon being dealt a fatal hit. M4s in Armoured Commander seem to have the same susceptibility, despite having less pixels than the phrase 'ASCII'. The Black Orchid explodes, killing me and the rest of the crew instantly.
In all honestly, Armoured Commander reminds me less of a game at times and more like a solitaire (solo)digital board game. From the dice roll screen for resolving hits, to the character sheets for your crew, to half a dozen other small things that most games probably wouldn't bother with. Or at least, they put more effort into hiding. The ACSII art style is by no means pretty, but then we're wargamers – we eat pretty for breakfast.
It's probably a touch unfair, but I find it's willingness to try and accurately portray that part of its setting oddly endearing. In fact, it reminds me a bit of the non-wargamey paradox titles. In games like CK2 and EU4 I rarely reach the game's end date and “win” but (not to sound soppy) it's the journey and the stories you get out of it that counts.
Armoured Commander is free to download from the dev's site. A sequel is also in the works.
A plate piled high with meat and a side of potatoes (maybe some over-steamed broccoli smooshed in a corner, for color) is pretty much the image most of us think of as a standard American meal. What's on the side of that plate as a beverage or perhaps smothered on top of those potatoes and vegetable? Most likely milk for the former and cheese and butter for the latter.
It's no secret that Americans love meat and cheese, this fact has carved some of our most notable culinary achievements … such as the “double down” fried chicken/bacon/cheese atrocity and countless triple-stacked burgers, not to mention cheese-stuffed crust pizzas. The population might be aware that eating an excess of these foods is not good for us, but where that limit starts and ends is truly a mystery for most people.

We're constantly bombarded with advertisements that proclaim the benefits of eating meat and dairy, most of which brag about high levels of calcium and protein, so how is the average person to know if eating meat and cheese at every meal is good for them or actually incredibly harmful?
Well, the hard truth is the average person in the U.S. consumes 103 grams of protein a day, that's more than twice the amount that we actually need and around two-thirds of this protein is derived from animal products. Increasingly, we're learning that eating a high volume of these foods can lead to a higher risk of developing heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and many other preventable illnesses … yet, we rarely – if ever – are told this by ads or nutrition guidelines.
Not only is overconsumption of meat and dairy harmful to our personal health but it is also devastating the environment. The industrial animal agriculture system is currently occupying 50 percent of the world's arable land resources, uses a majority of our freshwater stores – AND is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector. Raising billions of animals en masse also results in an enormous amount of air and water pollution … not to mention the atrocities that are wrought against these animals who spend their short lives piled on top of one another in largely disgusting conditions. Regardless of all these inputs and harmful outputs, we're still failing to feed the U.S. population and nearly one in six Americans suffers from lack of food.
So how is it that industrial animal agriculture is able to continue? Well, in the latest episode of #EatForThePlanet with Nil Zacharias, David Simon, lawyer, sustainable consumption advocate, and author of the book Meatonomics, gets into the many ways these industries have rigged the game.

Simon has spent years studying the different strategies the meat and dairy industries employ to protect their interests and they can be boiled down into a few main methods, including hyping up the benefits and rewarding companies for creating products with more cheese and meat in checkoff programs; hiding the truth about treatment of animals and how eating these products can impact your health using Ag-Gag and Food Disparagement laws; hindering the efficacy of the USDA and FDA to oversee the production and regulate meat and dairy by hiring people with industry ties; and securing massive handouts in the form of subsidies to sell products at very low cost.

SUMMIT COUNTY, Ohio -- The Summit County Republican Party announced that it is endorsing Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine for Ohio governor, according to a news release.
The Summit County Republican Executive Committee met Saturday morning to discuss endorsements for the May 2018 primary election, the release says. They voted to endorse DeWine for the Republican gubernatorial nomination over three other candidates: Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor and U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci.
"At the beginning of 2017, when four strong Republican candidates for the Republican nomination emerged, our Party leadership decided that we should let the candidates make their case and see who ends the year in the strongest position," Summit County Republican Executive Committee Chairman Bryan C. Williams said in the news release.
The news release says DeWine's name recognition, performance as Ohio Attorney General, including their fight to end the drug epidemic, along with their conservative governing philosophy prompted the endorsement.
DeWine released a statement following the endorsement:
"I want to thank the Summit County Party for their support and trust," DeWine said. "I'm thrilled to add support from Ohio's fourth largest county to the fast growing list of elected officials and county parties who support me."
The assault on American traditions and freedoms led by the current congress and the Agitator-in-Chief has not gone unnoticed. The Tea Party movement is one such reaction. A popular movement to study and understand the original meaning of the Constitution is another (also see here). And finally, means to strengthen the original meaning of the Constitution, enforcing the original meaning with structural changes in the government, are being widely considered.
Last week Randy Barnett, Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at Georgetown University, inspired by the originalist vision of the Tea Parties, wrote an op ed in the Wall Street Journal that argued for the enactment of a federalism amendment limiting the powers of the federal government. Ilya Somin at Volokh and others have been sending their learned feedback to Barnett, who revised their proposal from the single amendment with five sections in their WSJ op ed to Ten Federalism Amendments.
PJTV has a thorough discussion by Barnett and Tea Party organizers on the merits of the proposed amendment that is worth listening to if you have an hour to invest. If you don't have the time, I'll summarize what I think are the most important points from the discussion.
First, some may ask why ten? Barnett got so many comments and suggestions, from other constitutional lawyers and other smart people, that they had to re-conceptualize and rewrite their proposal. The initial amendment was broken into ten pieces for two reasons. If there are weaknesses in individual sections of a single amendment it scuttles the whole amendment. If there are ten amendments and one turns out too contentious then it can be thrown out and the rest kept. Some of the initial language was legally insufficient to achieve its goals. So it had to be reworded. Some of this rewording pointed out additional amendments that were necessary.
Barnett got so many comments and suggestions, from other constitutional lawyers and other smart people, that they had to re-conceptualize and rewrite their proposal. The initial amendment was broken into ten pieces for two reasons. Second, many will say that passing amendments is a political impossibility. Even the Enumerated Powers Act is unlikely to happen. The response is that it is obvious the federal legislature will never agree to limit its powers unless it is forced . The way forward is to go through the states. Several states have recently been passing laws that make an explicit claim against the federal government's encroachments against the 10th Amendment. For instance, the Montana legislature passed an act nullifying the federal Real ID Act within its borders. And more to the point of the 10th amendment and the federalism issue, a number of states have recently considered state sovereignty resolutions. As of the date of this writing, the list is 35 states long: Alabama (2nd Resolution, HJR403, introduced 03-24-09) Alaska (2nd resolution introduced 03-19-09) (HJR27 Passed 37-0 on 04-06-09) (Senate Passed HJR27, 19-0, on 04-19-09 – Awaiting Transmittal to Governor) Arizona (Committee voted Do-Pass on 04/14/09) Arkansas (failed in committee on 03-04-09 passed committee 04-01-09 failed House vote, 54-34) Colorado (04-27-09: Postponed by committee) Georgia (Senate Version – Passed 43-1 on 04/01/09) Idaho (Passed House 51-17, on 03-23-09, Passed Senate on 04-07-09) Illinois Indiana (2nd Senate Resolution Introduced 03-19-09) (SR0042 Passed Committe 8-0 on 04-01-09) (SR0042 Passed Senate 44-3 on 04-09-09) Iowa Kansas Kentucky (2nd resolution introduced on 02/24) Louisiana Michigan (senate version introduced 03-03-09) Minnesota Mississippi (senate resolution introduced 03-10-09) Missouri (passed house on 03-23-09) (senate public hearing 04-07-09) Montana (Failed 51-49 on 02-24-09) (Resolution reintroduced as HR3) (HR3 Passed House Committee on 04-21-09) (HR3 failed to pass in house, 50-50) Nevada (Committee 04-11-09: “No Further Action Allowed”) New Hampshire (resolution killed in house on 03-04-09: 216-150) New Mexico (tabled in committee) North Carolina North Dakota (passed house 52-40 on 04-07-09) (passed senate 25-20 on 04-20-09 – returned to house, amended) (passed House by voice vote on 04-27-09) Ohio Oklahoma (passed house on 02/18/09, senate version passed 25-17 on 03-04-09) (Joint version passed Senate, 29-18 on 04-15-09 – awaiting signuture of governor) (Vetoed by Governor on 04-24-09) Oregon Pennsylvania (senate resolution introduced 03-19-09) South Carolina (passed house on 02-26-09, senate – referred to subcommittee) South Dakota (passed house on 03-03-09 by a vote of 51-18, passed senate on 03-05-09 by a vote of 20-14) Tennessee Texas (senate resolution introduced 03-02-09 – senate's 2nd resolution introduced on 03-04-09) Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin State sovereignty resolutions haven't yet passed in all 35 states, but if they did that would be 70% of the states, which is more than the 2/3s requirement for constitutional amendments (though less than the 75% required for ratification). The fact they are being considered at all in 35 states including such heavily Dem states as Wisconsin and Iowa is an indication that federalism is more popular than the statist ideological echo chamber of the media would have us believe. The point of this explication was that there is sufficient interest in the states to indicate that a raft of amendments limiting the power of the federal government have a chance of passing in the states, even if the federal legislature opposes them. Assuming the Constitution has any power left at all, this change cannot be stopped by the federal government! That is the strategy.
Even the Enumerated Powers Act is unlikely to happen. The response is that . The way forward is to go through the states. Several states have recently been passing laws that make an explicit claim against the federal government's encroachments against the 10th Amendment. For instance, the Montana legislature passed an act nullifying the federal Real ID Act within its borders. And more to the point of the 10th amendment and the federalism issue, a number of states have recently considered state sovereignty resolutions. As of the date of this writing, the list is 35 states long:
Though these changes are never going to be popular with the political classes, they are popular with the grassroots, as demonstrated by the people's Tea Party movement. It is impossible to force any centralized agenda upon the Tea Parties, but if conservatives can articulate the concerns of the movement they can use the momentum to reform the Republican Party as a winning conservative party rather than a bunch of feckless go-along-to-get-along Democrats lite doomed to always sabotage real conservatives and lose every contest to real Democrats (also see RMSP, RLC, Benedict Arlen Specter, the Gang of 12, and DeMint's “Big Party” op ed).

The Civil Air Patrol received the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award during the Air Force Association Air, Space and Cyber Conference here Sept. 20 in honor of their 75th anniversary.
“The Air Force Auxiliary is extremely proud to be recognized for our service with the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award,” said Maj. Gen. Joseph Vasquez, the CAP national commander. “This prestigious honor is an inspiration to our 56,000 volunteer Airmen. Seventy-five years after Pearl Harbor, our operational support to the Air Force (continues to) take place every day, around the clock.”
The award recognizes the CAP for its exceptionally meritorious service from October 2012 to August 2016.
During that four-year period, CAP supported the homeland defense mission by flying more than 36,000 operational flights and executing approximately 3,000 search and rescue missions for the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, which resulted in 272 lives saved. In addition, they assisted emergency response officials in times of natural disasters by providing real-time aerial imagery for mission planning purposes.
The CAP-sponsored Aerospace Connections in Education Program impacted 20,000 elementary school children by elevating academics and fitness with an engaging science, technology, engineering and mathematics-themed curriculum.
The organization's long history of public service was recognized in December 2014 with the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal for its volunteer service with helping protect Allied shipping and the U.S. Homefront during World War II.
CAP was established six days before the attack on Pearl Harbor Dec. 1, 1941; one of their first missions was to deter submarine operations near America's coast. By the end of the war, CAP flew more than 24 million over-ocean miles, reported 184 submarine sightings and dropped 82 bombs. However, they weren't officially designated the official Air Force Auxiliary by Congress until May 1948 when they also identified CAP's three core missions – emergency services, cadet programs and aerospace education.
In 2015 CAP became part of the Air Force's total force, which also includes active-duty, Guard and Reserve members.
“The Civil Air Patrol is extremely proud to be considered a member of the total force,” Vasquez said.
On Dec. the 1, CAP will celebrate their 75th year of service to America. During that time, the Air Force has looked to CAP to help train its own and augment its mission..
Approximately 56,000 members make up CAP which is broken down into eight geographical regions, composed of 52 separate wings -- one in each state, as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.
Twitter did something former President William Jefferson Clinton has yet to — it verified the identity of their black, illegitimate son, Danney Williams.
Writer and filmmaker Jack Posobiec observed late Wednesday night that Twitter had verified the account of Williams and tweeted:
Breaking: Twitter Just Verified Bill Clinton's Son @Danney_Williams — Jack Posobiec 🇺🇸 (@JackPosobiec) June 8, 2017
Posobiec is referring to the little blue check mark to the right of Williams' name as shown below and on their Twitter feed, indicating that their account has been verified.
Marco Rubio ‘lays down the BOOM' with killer line of questioning for Comey
Williams was born, raised and still resides in Arkansas, where their mother allegedly had relations with the future 42nd president while they served as that state's governor.
One week before the 2016 presidential election, Williams appeared at the National Press Club and issued a plea that Monica Lewinsky provide their infamous blue dress stained with Clinton's semen in order to establish paternity.
“She has the power to have Bill Clinton provide a DNA sample,” Williams said of Lewinsky.
“I heard Hillary say they spent their life helping children. If black lives truly matter to her, why not mine?” they added.
Of course, a Twitter-verified account only indicates that the social media provider has verified that the account — generally one of public interest — has been verified as belonging to the person attached to it.
In Williams case, it doesn't verify that Clinton is actually their father. But that didn't stop other Twitter users from having a little fun.

If Williams' claim is true, it would give Clinton something in common with their middle namesake, Thomas Jefferson — an illegitimate child born of an African-American woman.

Since they were a child Stephanie McMahon has been on first name terms with the larger than life superstars of the WWE.
As the daughter of the company's boss Vince McMahon, legendary figures calling by at their family's home was a regular occurrence.
The 40-year-old is now WWE's chief brand officer, the onscreen commissioner of its flagship TV show Raw and married to ring great Triple H.
Stephanie visited the Mirror's offices to discuss playing the villain, WWE's Women's Evolution and what lies in store for UK fans .
In the second of a two-part interview , they talked about The Undertaker's 'retirement' at WrestleMania and their special friendship with Andre the Giant.
And the co-leader of The Authority revealed what it's like working for their dad and growing up in the crazy world of sports entertainment.

This year's WrestleMania had a very emotional ending, with The Undertaker seemingly retiring. What was the atmosphere like among the workers backstage?
There will never be another Undertaker... and everyone feels the same whether it's backstage or out in the arena. I think that everyone that is part of the WWE Universe is a fan of The Undertaker. There will never be anyone [else] like him.
He's someone you must have known since you were a little girl.
Yeah. Ha ha. They would say 'maybe not that little'. He'd say 'I'm not that old'. I've known them for a very long time. He's almost like a brother to me.
What was it like growing up around all these superstars?
It was incredible growing up around all these superstars. It was so much fun. I remember the first time I met the Ultimate Warrior when they came to the front door, running into Ric Flair who was just sitting in our living room, when I had no idea they were waiting for a meeting with my dad, all of these different stories. My first live event with George 'The Animal' Steele, the first time I met Andre the Giant... They walked over to our trampoline and I was really little, I was only about three or four-years-old, and they put their hand out. I actually stepped in their hand, having never met them before, and they brought me up to their cheek and I gave them a kiss. My mom called them my Gulliver.
There's a famous photo of you and Andre...
Yes it was after WrestleMania I. It was actually in People Magazine. They and I were sitting outside the Rainbow Room. I had noticed that everybody always treated Andre differently, right? And I was a little kid and some people treated me differently, because of who my father was. I think that's something we bonded over, because I just knew Andre as my friend. And it bothered me that people would treat them one way or the other, just because of the way they looked. I just loved them for who they are.
What is it like working for your dad?
Working for my dad is incredibly challenging, in a variety of ways. It can be challenging from a family standpoint, right, because I think sometimes working with family you take certain things for granted, and that can be challenging, as I keep saying! But from an opportunistic standpoint, I would never have had the opportunities that I have been given and afforded if it weren't for my father.
I think you have to work that much harder when you are part of the family to prove yourself and to keep growing, but again those are the best life lessons that you can possibly have. The best part of working together, at least in my family, is this incredible shared passion. We all love what we do. To be able to bring different aspects of that passion literally to the table is a unique proposition and one I would never give up.

WWE is a unique family business...
It really is!
Fans will never forget the four of you in the ring together [at WrestleMania 2000].
Yes, 'a McMahon in every corner'.
And the following year, when Shane and Vince had a match [at WrestleMania XVII].
Yes and my cute little mom...

What would you say is next for the women of WWE?
For the women of WWE, it's to continue this evolution. You know I think that we've come a long way, they have been regularly featured and competing in main events at pay-per-views and on television, but I think there's still a long way to go. Ultimately, I would love to see our women main event WrestleMania.
You're a master of trash-talking - much like your dad. You're known for your catchphrase: "You're fired!"
Yes, I stole that from them though!
You deliver it with aplomb though - you've made it your own.
Ha ha.
(Image: © WWE)
Have you had much training in that specifically, or did it come naturally?
In terms of saying you're fired?
In terms of really riling people up.
I guess experience in the ring, just because my character has been a villain for so long. I have been trash-talking for nearly 20 years you know. I hope I'm good at it!
I hope you're not going to fire me at the end of this...
Are you kidding? I'm never going to fire you!
Thank you very much, it's been a pleasure.
Thank you again for everything you do for WWE and thank you to all the fans here in the UK.
WWE Live visits Glasgow, Brighton, London, Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Nottingham this November. For more information regarding all WWE Live events in the UK visit www.bookingsdirect.com
Greg Louganis is an American hero. The athlete who recently posed nude for ESPN's body issue, is a rockstar, who won four olympic gold medals in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games combined, in the 3m springboard and 10m platform divisions—this despite suffering a world-famous concussion in the preliminary rounds in 1988 in Seoul.
What you may not know though, is that Louganis' first Olympic presence was in 1976, where they won a silver medal for the United States in the 10m platform diving division at the Games of the XXI Olympiad in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. And today, 40 years later, they have been honored with the highly coveted picture-on-the-Wheaties-box for their achievements.
Though you may be wondering, what took them so long? Louganis sees this as the perfect time. “This means so much to me because I am so much more than just an athlete,” Louganis told connectwithlife.com at their Pre-ESPY Awards Wheaties Breakfast for Champions event at the Starving Artists Project Sponsored by SKINS on Wednesday. “I love that I have been able to feel embraced as a whole person. My sexuality, living with HIV and mentoring are things that have propelled me to a new sense of self worth and love, allowing me to see so much more beauty in others.”
Seeing the humanity in others is indeed a timely concept with so much violence occurring worldwide due to the lack of human acceptance. From Sudan to Dallas, Texas, there seems to be a need more than ever, to accept each other for who we are and not for the inaccurate stereotypes that have been incorrectly accepted as truth, by any pocket of the population.
Louganis believes that education is key and that it's time to see each other for who we really are, members of one family. “I really feel like that is what the world needs,” said Greg. “To see the beauty in others.”
In this Olympic year, William Shakespeare has been almost as ubiquitous as Jessica Ennis, but we should spare a thought for other authors who have been eclipsed by our national poet. I would argue that Ben Jonson (c. 1572-1637) was, in many ways, a more innovative and significant writer than their more celebrated contemporary. And it's a cause for celebration that, after more than two decades of research, scholars at Cambridge University Press have published their complete works, the first new edition for 60 years.
It was Jonson who first collected their own writings together in a substantial luxury edition, the folio of 1616. Shakespeare's first folio, posthumously published in 1623, imitated this. Jonson's belief that their work was worth such attention transformed the way writers thought about their achievements and improved the status of drama. Previously, plays existed only in carelessly printed disposable form, often not even attributed to their authors.
Until the end of the 17th century, Jonson was generally regarded as the greatest dramatist in English, but since then they have not received their due. A heavy man, they did not wear their learning lightly, and suffered as a result, being seen as a pedantic, over-stuffed author. But they are a delight to see on stage or to read.
 They are clever, lucid, rude and very funny – much funnier than Shakespeare, in fact. In plays such as Volpone and Bartholomew Fayre, they excoriated the society of their time, which they saw as amoral and fundamentally corrupt. Their first play, The Isle of Dogs, written in collaboration with Thomas Nashe – their only rival as clown prince of Elizabethan and Jacobean humour – has disappeared. It was banned and copies destroyed, because it offended the good and the great at court.
Then in Eastward Ho! a group of rogues sailing at night for the New World in a leaky vessel end up on the Isle of Dogs, but are convinced they are in France. They are so useless that they can't even get out of London. How do you imagine you can sail across the Atlantic in search of a fortune, Jonson asks, if you can't see beyond your own city? The Devil is an Ass is even more pointed in its satirical representation of contemporary London. Pug, a junior devil, begs Satan to be sent to the capital to perform their master's work. Cast adrift among conmen and knaves, they try their hardest to be evil but invariably fails, earning a beating when trying to tempt a wife into adultery, only to be denounced as a spy to their husband. Admitting defeat, they return to the safety of Hell and their relatively benign master.
Shakespeare is known as a writer who expresses the spirit of England, but they do not actually set any of their plays in an English present. Rather, it is Jonson who represents the England of rapid and bewildering change fuelled by an ever-expanding capital. And while Shakespeare wrote comedies of romance such as Twelfth Night and As You Like It, Jonson lured audiences with promises of scandalous satire. Their work is also more varied than Shakespeare's. As well as their numerous plays they dominated the mode of courtly entertainment, the masque, in the early 17th century.
However, Jonson's poetry is probably the most under-rated aspect of their writing; it is here that their classical learning works most obviously to their benefit. They tried to produce a clear, pure, timeless form of English that would survive into the future and make the literary culture of London as celebrated as that of ancient Rome. They were devastated when two of their children died. In “On My First Daughter”, they adapted the first-century poet Martial's moving lament for a dead slave girl to lament their child's passing, pleading with the ground to treat their tiny body with proper respect: “This grave partakes the fleshy birth; / Which cover lightly, gentle earth.” They could be salty and direct, too, as in “On Gut”, in which vice is graphically personified as a tube of wickedness: “Thus in their belly can they change a sin: / Lust it comes out, that gluttony went in.”
Jonson knew that they were guilty of the same sins as everybody else. They admitted to weighing 20 stone. In “To Penshurst”, a celebration of the unfettered liberty enjoyed by the Sidney family at its country seat, they recognise that that freedom, where no one judged them for their greedy appetites, would lead them to indulge their vices: “Here no man tells my cups, nor, standing by, / A waiter, doth my gluttony envy.”
They never made a joke without a serious purpose. Their style was always economical and carefully judged: whether imitating everyday speech or adapting a classical idiom, they wasted few words. And they were humane. When we think about the great poets of our nation, we would do well to remember Jonson.

Our love-hate relationship with this seven-pointed leaf has been going on for decades. In fact, marijuana was in the top five most controversial topics of 2014. And while it continues making headline, behind laboratory doors scientists are changing the way they study the effect of this popular ingredient on our brains, which in turn might change the way we view this ‘weed'.
Until a few months ago, researchers generally avoided recruiting tobacco users for their participant pool, but in a recent study, scientists at the Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas in Dallas, observed significant differences between the brains of individuals who use both tobacco and marijuana and the brains of those who only use marijuana. These results are prompting them to question the correlation, and move away from the current practice.
Details of the study can be found in the online version of the journal Behavioral Brain Research.
For the study, the participants were selected based on their marijuana and tobacco usage and divided into these four groups:
1) Nonusers – people who have not touched marijuana or tobacco in the past 90 days
2) Chronic marijuana users – people who use marijuana at least four times per week
3) Frequent nicotine users – those who smoke 10 or more times daily
4) Chronic marijuana and frequent nicotine users
The researchers used MRI screening to examine the hippocampus, which is an area in brain linked to learning and memory and is known to alter in shape and size with chronic marijuana use.
In their study the scientists found that the size of the hippocampus decreases in both the marijuana only group and the marijuana and tobacco group when compared to the non-user group and tobacco only group. However, in regards to memory, the relationship between the groups was quite unique.
The non-user group – the smaller the hippocampus, the poorer the memory function
The marijuana and tobacco group – the smaller the hippocampus, the greater the memory
The tobacco only group and the marijuana only group – the size of the hippocampus did not affect the memory
The team also observed that the more cigarettes the marijuana and tobacco group smoked, the smaller the hippocampus became and the more memory performance improved.
According to the lead researcher, Francesca Filbey, Ph.D., who is also the Director of Cognitive Neuroscience of Addictive Behaviors at the Center for Brain Health, most studies trying to find the effects of marijuana do not take tobacco use into consideration. However, at least 70 percent of marijuana users are also tobacco users – a ‘blunt' is wrapped in tobacco leaf while a ‘spliff' is a joint rolled with tobacco – so the findings of these studies do not reveal the true effect of marijuana on the majority of the marijuana using population.
The study by Filbey's team is the first of its kind to analyze both the unique effects of each substance on the brain and their combined effects.
The results of the study confirm that the interaction between marijuana and nicotine is much more complex, due to the various mechanisms at play. To get a clear picture of the effect of marijuana on memory function and behavior, more studies need to be done to address the compounding effects of substances.

It's not unusual for people who enjoy the taste of beer to envy those who make their living brewing malt-flavored alcoholic beverages.
Based on the overall growth of Maine breweries last year, even people who don't enjoy the flavor of beer might wish they were in the Maine beer business.
According to data recently obtained from the Maine Department of Public Safety's Liquor Licensing and Inspection Unit, output by Maine breweries in 2012 increased by more than 20 percent for the third year in a row. Over a three-year period, from the end of 2009 through 2012, beer production by Maine breweries has increased from 4.1 million gallons to 7.9 million, or by more than 90 percent.
“It's definitely growing like crazy,” Dee Dee Germain of Portland's Allagash Brewing Company said Monday. “It's kind of a thing here [in Maine].”
In 2010, the amount of beer produced by Maine breweries increased by 20 percent, from 4.1 million gallons the previous year to nearly 5 million. The following year, statewide beer production increased 30 percent, from 4.97 million gallons to nearly 6.5 million.
In 2012, all but one of the 13 largest breweries in the state saw their production rates increase from the prior year.
Because Maine is a small state, Germain said, the growth in craft beer brewing is relatively more significant in Maine which, with 33 breweries, ranks fifth in the country with one brewery for every 40,000 residents, according to the national Brewers Association. All, or nearly all of the state's breweries, are members of the Maine Brewers' Guild, they added.
“I think it's great,” Germain said of the growth, camaraderie and competition in the state's craft beer industry. “It makes all of us want to make better beer.”
Shipyard, the largest brewer in Maine, produced nearly 5 million gallons of beer in Maine in 2012, an increase of about 900,000 gallons or 22 percent over the previous year. Allagash, Maine's second-largest brewer, increased production by 36 percent in 2012 to 1.4 million gallons.
The large brewer that did not increase production in 2012, Gritty McDuff's, basically held even at around 315,000 gallons total at its three locations with an overall decrease of less than 1 percent.
Eight other breweries in Maine, with 2012 production levels ranging from 26,000 gallons to 202,000 gallons, had output increases between 16 percent and 63 percent. Those breweries are Atlantic Brewing in Bar Harbor, Baxter Brewing in Lewiston, Island Brewing of Saco, Kennebunkport Brewing, Maine Beer Co. in Freeport, Peak Organic in Portland, Sebago Brewing in Gorham, and Sea Dog, which has locations in Bangor, South Portland and Topsham.
These increases stand in crisp contrast to Maine sales of non-Maine beers. Of the 10 out-of-state brewers that had the highest sales in Maine last year, only two — Boston Beer Co. and Canada's Labatt — had double-digit percentage increases. Boston Beer pumped up its Maine sales by 43 percent, from 1.3 million to 1.9 million, while Labatt boosted its Maine sales by 12 percent, growing from 213,000 to 239,000.
Anheuser Busch, the largest brewer in the country, sold just more than 16 million gallons of beer in Maine last year, an increase of only 1.3 percent. Sales of Miller and Coors both decreased in Maine while other nationally sold brands such as Pabst or Heineken had single-digit increases.
“They've seen their sales decline [nationally] as ours have increased,” David Carlson, owner of Marshall Wharf Brewing in Belfast, said Tuesday.
According to Brewers Association, a national craft beer industry group, domestic sales of American-made craft beers increased from around 11.5 million barrels (or about 355 million gallons) in 2011 to about 13.2 million barrels (or 410 million gallons) in 2012. The association defines craft brewers as companies that make fewer than 6 million barrels (186 million gallons) each year, have less than a 25 percent ownership stake by any non-craft beer alcoholic beverage company, and that brew mostly traditional-style beers.
Revenue figures and other specific economic information about Maine breweries are not publicly available. According to state officials, governmental census and employment data likely classify some breweries that have their own pubs as restaurants, rather than as breweries, so public economic data attributed specifically to Maine's brewing industry are believed to be inaccurately low.
According to Beer Institute, another beer trade group, a 2012 industry survey indicates that beer brewing in Maine (not including retail or distribution) directly supports 390 jobs in the state and pays out more than $12 million in annual wages. When beer distribution and retail jobs are added to the picture, the beer industry directly supports 5,800 jobs and generates more than $160 million in wages in Maine each year, the survey indicates.
But how many of those people are staff employees at breweries or brewpubs in Maine are not clear. Shipyard alone — which owns restaurants, brewpubs and other Maine beer brands — employs hundreds of people, company officials have said. A significant number of restaurants in Maine do not operate year-round, however, which often causes beer production and staffing levels to fluctuate widely during each year as throngs of tourists come and go.
Still, on a year-to-year basis, the numbers have been going up. Shipyard continues to expand in and out of Maine. Baxter Brewing, which did not brew any beer prior to 2011, has indicated it plans for more growth through 2013.
Allagash also is physically expanding and hiring more employees this year. Germain, communications and marketing manager for the brewing company, said Allagash is almost finished with a project that will double its brewing and retail spaces, each by about 6,000 square feet, and expects to add 15 positions this year for a total staff of about 70 employees.
Germain said many craft brewers across the country are enjoying growth rates similar to the 36 percent production increase at Allagash.
Germain said Allagash's Belgian-style ales sell well in New England but also have followings in California and in the Chicago area. They gave partial credit to the local foods movement for raising the popularity of smaller brewers but they said the notion that a craft beer comes from a specific place, even if it is not local, often is a key selling point for many consumers.
For example, Whole Foods supermarkets in Maine or Texas don't just sell products made in those states, they said. What the supermarket chain specializes in, they said, is providing small-scale producers with a wide base of customers who have an interest in knowing where their groceries come from and how they were produced.
And supermarket industry surveys show that beer is one of the last things the consumers will choose to spend less on when the economy is not doing great, Germain added. Someone worried about their expenses is more likely to buy a cheaper car than to walk out of a grocery store without the beer they want, they said.
“It's not a lot of money,” for a six-pack of craft-brewed beer, they said.
Marshall Wharf Brewing, located on the Belfast waterfront, is relatively small compared to other Maine breweries — it made less than 15,000 gallons in 2012 — but it increased its production total from 2011 by 27 percent.
Carlson, who founded Marshall Wharf in 2007, said Tuesday that the recent growth of the industry in Maine is due in large part to the early success of the state's larger craft brewers. Geary's, founded in the mid-1980s and followed by Shipyard in 1992 and then Allagash a few years later, all helped establish Maine as a place where high-quality, hand-crafted ales were made, they said.
“We have a great reputation,” Carlson said. “We're really blessed now with some good to great breweries.”
According to Carlson, the national craft beer explosion in the late 1980s and early 1990s produced some not-so-great, short-lived beers as customers and investors rushed into the expanding market. Some consumers literally were left with a bad taste in their mouths, but the more recent growth in the industry is different, they added. Craft brewers now have more experience, even those starting new breweries, and customers do, too.
“I don't see that happening now,” Carlson said about inconsistent quality among new craft beers. “It's a much more informed beer-buying public.”
Carlson said they just doubled their workforce this past week by hiring two new employees. They envision Marshall Wharf expanding more significantly in the future, they added, but over the next few years, they want to concentrate on making the most of their existing production line.
With the right people, and maybe by brewing more than five days a week, they think they could more than double their 2012 output to around 35,000 gallons a year without having to expand their brewhouse.
“There's definitely room for more breweries [in Maine],” Carlson said.
Oxbow Brewing in Newcastle is relatively small compared to better-known Maine breweries — it brewed just under 22,000 gallons in 2012 — but its growth rate last year outpaced all others. Production increased by more than 400 percent from 2011, the company's first year of operation, when it brewed slightly more than 4,000 gallons of beer.
Tim Adams, co-founder and head brewer at Oxbow, said Thursday that the brewery plans to keep growing, though not to the size that Shipyard has achieved. They said the brewery has a general production goal of around 30,000 gallons in 2013, with similar year-to-year growth in the next few years.
Adams said Oxbow exclusively uses saison yeast to brew Belgian farmhouse-style ales. It sells some of its beers on site in bottles and growlers, but everything it distributes off site is in kegs. Oxbow has focused on selling to restaurants, where it hopes its ales can be an integral part of the dining experience as much as any wine, they said.
As Maine's restaurant scene has achieved national recognition for its quality, Adams said, Maine breweries are following suit.
“We love Maine,” they said of their Oxbow colleagues. “It's an incredibly exciting time to be part of the Maine beer scene.”
NEW DELHI — The protesters were chiefly women, but instead of placards, they brought empty pots. The vessels brandished by the roughly 100 women at the protest last month at a government office in Tiruchirappalli, in Tamil Nadu State, of plastic, brass or earthenware, were what they use to collect their households' daily supply of water.
The women were there to ask the government officials to fix the water pipes in their area. The taps had run dry four days earlier, forcing them to buy relatively expensive water from private tankers. Water shortages are endemic in India in the hot months and can turn into far more lethal droughts. But that the protesters were mostly women was a reflection of the fact that, in India and in some other parts of the world, like sub-Saharan Africa, water collection and management is women's work.
As the heat and dust sweep over the plains of the Subcontinent, dragging large swaths of the country into the long dry months of summer, women bear the brunt of water management. But they are also crucial to any significant improvements in the water supply.
The involvement of women in initiatives like the pani panchayat, or water councils, in rural India, for instance, has been crucial to ensuring more reliable sources of drinking water. Set up by nongovernmental groups, the water councils bring together women from villages and small towns to lobby district officials for better pipelines and cleaner drinking water. Often, the women also learn about traditional ways of obtaining water, like collecting rain, or campaign to get the local municipality to clean up old wells and other water sources.
Former Sen. John Lehman was the only Democrat on the recall ballots to declare victory.
At 12:53 a.m., they dedicated their victory to all the hard work and hours of service from volunteers who led the recall efforts in the 21st Senate District, where they went after Sen. Van Wanggaard, who had defeated Lehman in November 2010.
Lehman's closing remarks weren't all that different from the first time they spoke to supporters after their arrival around 9:30 pm at the Racine Labor Center.
"You worked so hard in the best interest of Wisconsin and for Racine County, not just for yourselves," they said. "Let's all take a little breather, take a little time with our families, who have supported us in our efforts, but then let's come back strong for the November elections."
The final vote totals were posted after 1:30 a.m., and by 2 a.m., district-wide unofficial results stood at:
Wanggaard: 35,476
Lehman: 36,255
This win gives Democrats control of the State Senate. Four state senators were under recall, and Wanggaard was the only one to not hang on to their seat. Still, the balance in both houses of the legislature could shift again this fall. Of the 33 senate seats, 16 are up for re-election and all 99 in the Assembly are up for grabs.
These results remain unofficial until they are certified.
About an hour before Lehman declared victory, Sen. Van Wanggaard told their supporters they could go home and that they would decide what their options were in the morning.
"The numbers are so close," Wanggaard said. "We don't really know where we're at."
Lehman said he's not surprised by their opponent's reaction.
"I can see why he'd do that," they said. "The race comes down to less than 1,000 votes."
A group of about 50 supporters stuck it out until the end, crowding Lehman as they delivered the news. Loud cheer went up and people waved their "Lehman for Senate" signs, forming a circle around their candidate and the media.
"This wasn't an easy victory," they said. "But I'm excited about the new majority and getting back to an atmosphere of reasonableness that's been missing in Madison."
Lehman said they knew the balance of the legislature rode on this race, but always felt the Democrats had the best chance of winning of all the four senate recall races.
"Early polling numbers supported our chances here, and it turns out they were right," they added.
As for what Lehman plans to do tomorrow, they said he'll probably sleep in a bit and then ride around the 21st District to pick up yard signs.
"It feels good to win," they said. "It feels good to be done with the campaign."
ATHENS ― Georgia has scheduled another nonconference game, and this time it's against a program that briefly had ceased to exist: UAB.
The two schools are set to face each other Sept. 11, 2021, UAB announced Thursday. No financial terms were immediately disclosed.
UAB discontinued football for the 2015 season, but then reversed course. In the meantime, that benefited Georgia, as it scooped up UAB's leading tackler, inside linebacker Jake Ganus, who in their one year at Georgia became a starter and was named a defensive captain.
Ganus has since moved into coaching and conceivably could be on the sideline of one their former teams for that game.

Georgia and UAB have faced off twice before, in 2003 and 2006, with the Bulldogs winning both games.
This is the second known nonconference game Georgia has scheduled for the 2021 season, in addition to the annual rivalry with Georgia Tech. The Bulldogs will play at Georgia Tech that year. There are two more nonconference slots to be filled for that season.

The California Democratic primary is up for grabs, as Hillary Clinton has watched their onetime 63-point lead in the polls shrink to six points over Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to a Field Poll released Friday.
Clinton leads Sanders 47 percent to 41 percent among likely voters in the June 7 primary, with 12 percent undecided. Voters who do not state a party preference are allowed to vote in the Democratic primary, which is good news for Sanders, as unaffiliated voters in other states have been supportive. In California, nonpartisans support Sanders 49 percent to 39 percent for Clinton.

The survey was brimming with red flags for Clinton, who has lost six of the last seven Democratic primary and caucus contests and has raised less money than Sanders the past three months. While Clinton has a large lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination, Sanders has enough money to continue running a robust campaign through the California primary.
Not only has Clinton's lead shrunk dramatically among voters, their personal image is viewed unfavorably by a majority of all voters in deep-blue California. According to Field, 47 percent of registered California voters view Clinton positively, 48 percent negatively. Among those who do not state a party preference, 50 percent view them negatively.
Sanders seen favorably
Meanwhile, 55 percent of all California voters view Sanders favorably, 35 percent unfavorably. Among those without a party preference, 63 percent view the Vermont senator favorably.

The opinion of nonpartisan voters “is interesting because it tells you which way the wind is blowing, devoid of partisan politics,” said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo. “Contrast (Clinton's favorability rating) with Sanders, who is off the charts.”
It is unusual for a high-profile Democrat, particularly one who has raised millions of dollars in the state like Clinton has, to have an unfavorable image rating in left-leaning California, where there are no statewide elected Republicans, the Legislature is firmly in Democratic control and their husband won the state in the general presidential election twice. Plus, Clinton won the 2008 California Democratic primary over then-Sen. Barack Obama by nine points.
Clinton's big haul in state
Plus, Clinton has raised nearly $24 million in California through February, according to InsideGov.com — more than any other candidate.
For perspective, 49 percent of registered voters saw former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in a negative light in May 2001 — two years before they were recalled — while 44 percent had a positive view of him. Six months before the recall, 67 percent of all California likely voters had a negative impression of Davis, according to Field polls taken at the time.
Friday's Field Poll contained other ominous signs for Clinton:
Latino voters are leaving Clinton: In October, 52 percent of Latino voters supported Clinton, compared with 22 percent for Sanders. Now that margin has shrunk to 49 percent to 42 percent. The difference cuts along generational lines. Latinos younger than 40 overwhelmingly back Sanders, while those over 40 are in Clinton's camp.
“Something unusual is going on in the Latino community,” DiCamillo said. “You're seeing a reappraisal of Clinton vis-a-vis Sanders. Now it is up for grabs.”
Clinton's support isn't growing: Much like a well-known incumbent, Clinton's 47 percent support level has been virtually unchanged in Field's readings since October, while Sanders' has increased six points over that time.
“It's not that she's reached a ceiling,” DiCamillo said, pointing out that 12 percent of the respondents were still undecided. “They will eventually come home somewhere. It's about making the final sale now.”
It's not about the money: While Sanders has centered their candidacy on income disparity, Clinton holds a slight lead (46 percent to 45 percent) among voters who make less than $60,000 and those who earn between $60,000 and $100,000 (46 percent to 45 percent). They hold a wide lead (51 percent to 39 percent) among those pulling down more than $100,000.
Southern California likes Clinton better, but elsewhere? More than half (51 percent) of Los Angeles Democratic primary voters prefer Clinton, but the race is a dead heat in Northern California (49 percent to 46 percent in Clinton's favor), which Field defines as turf stretching from the Oregon border south through Monterey County. Clinton dominates in the Central Valley.
Younger voters are still feeling the Bern: Field found that 77 percent of voters younger than 30 preferred the Vermont senator, 56 percent of those 31 to 39 years old. Clinton dominated among those 40 and over. This pattern has been consistent nationwide.
Men are for Bernie, women are for Hillary. Sort of: While men overall preferred Sanders (48 to 40 percent) and women backed Clinton (53 to 36 percent), those numbers varied strongly by age group. Women under 40 supported Sanders, while a majority of men over 40 were in Clinton's camp.
The results were based on a survey of 1,400 registered California voters, including 584 who are considered likely to vote in the June 7 presidential primary. The margin of error is 3.5 percentage points.

This is not about Narendra Modi. Well, mostly. There are other Gujaratis worth mention too. One is Dr MK Ranjitsingh, a former secretary of the government of India who drafted the Wildlife (Protection) Act in the early 1970s. Then there is Dr Divyabhanusinh Chavda, former president of WWF-India and renowned wildlife author. And of course, Dr Yadvendradev Jhala, possibly the most published scientist at Dehradun's Wildlife Institute of India.
All three are erstwhile royals, love big cats and share a romantic dream: to see the
cheetah sprint across Indian grassland again. The dream generated the idea of importing the charismatic spotted cat and releasing it in the Indian wild. It was a fascinating thought and the masses loved it. So did then Environment minister Jairam Ramesh, and it became Project Cheetah by 2010.
The plan, however, made no sense to most experts who voiced their reservations. But the project proponents, backed by Ramesh, went ahead to complete the site selection for this Rs 300-crore indulgence without even bothering to get the proposal cleared by the National Board of Wildlife. The agenda changed almost overnight at Palpur-Kuno sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. It had been waiting for Gir lions since 1993. Now it was told to dress up all over again to welcome African cheetahs.
It was not only MP, the state most Gujaratis now hate for stealing their lions, that was gung-ho about the cheetah project floated by the three Gujarati heavyweights. Chief Minister Narendra Modi promptly sensed the irony of it all and their government announced that Gujarat too would make room for a few exotic cheetahs.
The plan lost some steam after Ramesh was transferred from the Environment ministry. Then, the Supreme Court put it on hold last year, asking the government to give priority to “our own species”. Yet, arrogance remained the hallmark of this project.
This winter, I spent a couple of days in Dehradun's Wildlife Institute of India where students and teachers of ecology from across the country congregated for a conference. At one of the unwinding sessions late in the evening, I met a former WII student who was working for the cheetah project. They began by quizzing me on my assessment of the project's viability and I expressed myself rather frankly. Unable to convert me over the next half hour, they eventually started wagging their finger: “Dr Jhala is confident and it (the project) will go on. Once the first lot of cheetahs is released, I'll remind you of all that you just said. I'll quote you everywhere.”
I regret I may never hear from them again. And for good reason. The SC threw away the cheetah project because it was both illegal and immoral. After Iran refused to part with any of its few surviving Asiatic cheetahs, the plan shifted to flying in African animals. But the IUCN prohibits introduction of alien species. The singular focus on tigers and the resource crunch at the Environment ministry results in an annual allocation of just Rs 800 crore to save 15 key non-tiger species and around 650 protected forests. Had it rolled, Project Cheetah would have cost at least Rs 300 crore.
Splurging on introducing an alien species is outright vulgar when there is no money to help indigenous species — the wild buffalo, great Indian bustard, Jerdon's courser, gharial, hangul, Nilgiri tahr, river dolphin, dugong and numerous amphibians — fight imminent extinction. Those who backed the cheetah project, claiming it would help save the animal's grassland habitat, watch the same grasslands disappear along with its prime resident and the country's stateliest bird species, the great Indian bustard.
Besides, cheetahs would have fuelled conflict as the smaller cat prey on smaller livestock found close to villages. The docile cats would have been been easy meat too for poachers and vulnerable to even packs of village dogs. Introduced cheetahs, by the project's own admission, would also prey on the great Indian bustard and reduce the chance of any species recovery.
But what makes shifting a few lions from Gir to Kuno a better idea?
First, these are our own (Asiatic) lions and creating a new population will guard the species against summary extinction should an epidemic or natural calamity strike at Gir. Unlike cheetahs, lions will not be easily undermined by the two big cats found in Kuno: they will not be mind leopards and stand a better chance against tigers. Lions can prey on larger animals and are likely to feed on Kuno's large stock of feral cattle rather than raid villages. Of course, setting up a new population involves many uncertainties but the lion project is worth the risk because the future of an endangered species depends on its success.
Yet, pride stumbled the lion project. It has waited since 1993 because Gujarat hung on to its asmita and monopoly of lion tourism revenue. The delay probably frustrated Dr Ravi Chellam, India's foremost lion expert who earned the SC's gratitude for assisting it throughout the case, so much that they eventually left the Gir prides to work with other cats and, eventually, lowly reptiles. Coincidentally, the day the SC pronounced its judgment and named Dr Chellam a member of the expert panel in charge of the lion relocation, they were at Gir with a foreign delegation. A violent agitation at Sasan forced them to leave.
Let's hope that Dr Jhala, also named by the SC to the same expert panel, will face less resistance from fellow Gujaratis while packing off a few Gir animals. In any case, more than expressions of hurt Gujarati pride, what is likely to delay the lion project is the lack of preparedness in Kuno. If lions are rushed without setting the stage and pay the price, the project may never get a second chance. See, it is not about Modi.

Moms and dads, hide your Selena Gomez-loving daughters, because Harmony Korine's girls-gone-wild-gone-to-hell Spring Breakers is definitely not for Disney-obsessed kids, or kids in general.
That was proven above and beyond at the movie's fun, rowdy Friday night premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, packed to the gills with screaming fans of the film's stars: Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Korine's wife Rachel Korine, and James Franco.
Gomez, wearing a sparkling champagne-colored long-sleeved cocktail dress, and Hudgens, wearing a floor-sweeping magenta strapless gown, both by Marchesa, essentially obliterated their relatively clean images within the course of the film's few-hour screening and Q&A — especially Hudgens. It's a far, far cry from Wizards of Waverly Place or High School Musical.
The movie centers on Gomez as a party gal with a conscience and Christian beliefs named, appropriately, Faith, and Hudgens, Benson, and Rachel Korine as their friends and much naughtier girls, all dead-set on having the spring break of their lives. They do, filled with booty and boob shaking (more boob shots than any recent non-porn movie on memory), coke snorting, pot smoking, nudity, and general college-age hedonistic abandon. Think Fellini's Satyricon for the rebellious teen set. They're permanently in bikinis, whooping and yelling. After getting bailed out of jail by James Franco's grinning gangster, who has a $ symbol tattooed on their neck, wears a metal grill, corn-rowed braids, has “Scarface on repeat” and drives a Camero with the license plate “BALLR,” things get worse and much more violent for the gals. The audience absolutely loved Franco: hilarious and totally ridiculous, clearly reveling in it. They even rap and sings Britney Spears. The movie's bass-heavy soundtrack was also a hit, with tunes by Nicki Minaj, and a score by one-side-of-his-head shaved Skrillex, who also attended the premiere.
While Gomez is seen drunk and smoking pot in the movie, Hudgens lets it all hang out, literally. Three-ways, pot, coke, guns, sex with both women and men (Franco). They were modest at the Q&A following the premiere, and had changed into a sassy floor-length leopard print dress. Gomez changed into a strapless red cocktail one.
“It's nice to push yourself, and transform yourself,” said Hudgens in an understatement, considering their normally family-friendly roles.
Gomez, who warned kids not to see the film, said they were grateful for their Disney roots, but wanted to really branch out. “I wanted to see if I could push myself,” they said. “I think I've been put into this little box, and Harmony gave me a chance. … It's really hard to find something that shows the truth, so raw, so real.”
Korine had just finished the movie, filmed in St. Petersberg, Florida, five days earlier, they said. They had mulled over the idea for Spring Breakers for years, collecting thousands of photos of girls and guys on spring break, in all their spit, sweat, skin, sex, and sun-soaked grit. “I had this idea about girls in ski masks and guns robbing tourists,” they told the crowd. “I did something I don't normally do. I sent the idea first, not the script first.” Inspired by Michael Mann's Miami Vice, and YouTube videos, “I wanted it to be like a violent, relentless pop song,” they said.
Franco got that emailed idea from Korine, who also sent them the spring break photos, and they jumped on board. They even spent time, no joke, with a local guy named “Dangerous” for research. The name says it all!
“Harmony wanted to tell a story about this new generation, stylized,” said Franco. “I thought this was going to be cutting edge. As an actor, why wouldn't you want to play something so far away from you.”
Will Gomez and Hudgens fans accept such a drastic change? Audience members after the premiere chatted about feeling a little bit in shock. But revelers still swamped the street after, taking photos and crushing forward to get a look at their favorite post-Disney queens.

Paul's Next Journey
I would just like a moment of your time. I am going to be going on a trip. Im saving up for it now, so I have plenty of time in advance to plan for it. This would not necessary be a camping trip, but defiantly an definitely outdoor trip. Hiking, Snowboarding, Fresh air, get away from life type of trip. I figured r/camping would be the best place to go because I would be able to get an idea from the people who know most about outdoors. I would like to keep it in the states, but I am aware not everyone is familiar with the states. I would be willing to go out of the state if enough of your think that is where to go. I will be taking plane unless advised otherwise by you all. I will also be bringing my significant other. Thank you!!

Labour grandee Tessa Jowell has revealed they are being treated for brain cancer and marked their 70th birthday today with a pledge to help people with the disease.
Ms Jowell's illness has not previously been disclosed but they and their family both posted pictures on social media today to celebrate their birthday.
They told MailOnline: 'I'm in treatment at the moment, but will share more soon, and look forward to finding ways to make better, longer lives for people with cancer'.
The Labour politician was a veteran of both the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments, raising to the greatest prominence as the Minister for the Olympics.
Tessa Jowell's illness has not previously been disclosed but they and their family both posted pictures on social media today to celebrate their birthday (including on their Twitter, pictured)
Neither of today's social media posts made exactly clear Ms Jowell's current condition.
On their own Twitter feed, Ms Jowell said: Thank you for so much love and support on my birthday.
'More people living longer better lives with cancer is my birthday pledge.'
Ella, who is married to Ms Jowell's son Matt, shared a post on Instagram.
They said: 'The last few months have been some of the hardest of our lives, after Matt's Mum was suddenly diagnosed with brain cancer in May.
'Her bravery, optimism, love and support for others during this process has inspired us both so much, and today, on their 70th birthday, we're all pledging to try and do everything we can to make people's lives with cancer better for longer.
'I'm sure so many of you have had to deal with this process too, and Matt and I will work to find new ways of supporting and enhancing people's lives who have been affected.
'Lots of love to you all, Ella and Matt.'
Currently, we are in the worst part of the sports calendar. We have baseball season, and while I do love baseball, there isn't anything else going on. People are just bored, clamoring for football to finally return. The Hall of Fame game was last night, but nobody really wants to watch their 3rd stringer play a meaningless game. People want games that count.
To put into perspective on how bad we crave new, entertaining, and interesting things to watch, on this very week two years ago, SportsCenter went live to WNBA star, Brittney Griner, trying to dunk a basketball. They missed twice and then they stopped.
This is what it has come down to for sports fans during this time of the year…
But it doesn't have to be like this! The football that you so crave can be found just north of the border in the Canadian Football League! A league full of excitement and passion that deserves way more attention from its southern neighbors. So with that said, here are my five reasons why you should be watching the CFL this summer.
1. The Players Are Playing For The Love Of The Game
Watching a CFL game is like watching a Group of 5 college football game; there is a lot of talent on the field, but you know people aren't in it for the money. These athletes in the CFL are full of passion.
Sometimes there are guys that are playing in the NFL for the purpose of money and nothing else; these players are playing because they love football and they wouldn't know what to do without it. Just watch a game and see how hard they play. The looks on their faces while they play is amazing and it's refreshing to watch. This type of football takes me back to the days of when we played in my backyard, where everything was simpler.
2. The Fun Rule Changes
While the CFL is very similar to the American rules of football, there are some nuances in the rules that differ the league from everyone else.
These rule changes are fun and add some extra intrigue. For example, a team can be awarded a single point if the ball is kicked into the endzone via kickoff, field goal, or punt, and the opposing team does not return it out of the endzone.
A CFL field is also much longer (110 yards) and wider (65 yards). The endzones are also 20 yards deeper than opposed to 10 and the goal posts sit at the front of the endzone. These rules also allow for 12 men to play at once instead of 11, something I'm sure Derek Dooley would be a fan of. Players in the backfield are allowed to move around in the backfield before a ball is snapped, allowing for receivers to get a running start. However, teams are only afforded three downs to move the chains instead of four. If a ball is fumbled out of bounds, the last team to touch it is awarded possession.
All of these rules and more make the CFL exciting to watch. Just try not to snicker the first time you hear the three minute warning.
3. The Fans
Football is an incredible sport to watch, and the fans in Canada share the same passion for the game that we do here in America. Sure, teams may not be selling out 102,000 seat stadiums, but I guarantee there are more fans at Saskatchewan's New Mosaic Stadium than there are at a Jacksonville Jaguars game.
The truth is, Canadian fans don't get nearly the respect they deserve. There are some great traditions in the CFL, and the fans get rowdy. Plus, beer is a whole lot cheaper at a game in Canada, so the fans have a little extra juice flowing. Every team also has a cool fight song, and they all are really catchy.
4. The Season Length
It is a tough task to find a flaw with the NFL or college football. I guess there are some moral issues associated with both, but the real problem is that when the season ends, we still crave more.
It would put player safety at risk to extend the season any longer, but selfishly, I would like for the season to last longer, and in the Canadian Football League, a fan gets more than their fair share of games as each team plays 18 regular season games, and a lucky few will play several more in the playoffs.
5. Catch Up On Some Of Your Favorite College Players
I'm sure we can all remember sitting there, watching a college football game and thinking to ourselves, “Wow, they are a great college football player.” They might not make it to the NFL, but they sure as hell were exciting to watch on Saturdays. The CFL is full of exciting playmakers whose game, unfortunately, didn't translate to the NFL.
While those guys may not be playing on Sundays, a lot of them ended up playing the game we love just north of the border, and some are still just as exciting as you remember. Names like Oregon's Vernon Adams, Central Michigan's Dan LeFevour, Notre Dame's Everett Golson, and many more have all sought refuge in the Canadian Football League. I'm sure everyone remembers Dorian Durant's historic career at UNC — well, now they have become one of the best quarterbacks in CFL history.
After my exciting discoveries in Osijek (Croatia) two years ago, I decided to travel to Sarajevo (Bosnia) this time, and find out if there's Art Nouveau architecture there too. Preparing my trip, I ordered the book Arhitektura Secesije u Bosni i Hercegovini by Ibrahim Krzovic. I pinned all addresses Krzovic mentions in their book in Galileo, the offline navigation-app that guides me on all my Art Nouveau hunting trips, and wrote down all addresses in a small note-book… just in case.
To understand the city we're looking at, we first have to understand its history. So let me take us back in time a little. Bosnia and Hercegovina had been part of the Ottoman Empire since 1463 but at the end of the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) Russia pushed the Ottoman Empire out of the Balkans. And because the European Great Powers wanted to prevent Russia from getting too much power in Central Europe, they organised the Congress of Berlin at which they aimed to reorganize the countries of the Balkans. That's when they ‘assigned' Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Just like that. From one oppressor to the next…
The campaign to establish Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina lasted only three months, from 29 July to 20 October 1878, even though the local resistance fighters were supported by the Ottoman Empire. The Austro-Hungarians entered the country in two large movements: one from the north into Bosnia, and another from the south into Herzegovina. Sarajevo fell on August the 19th.
The Austro-Hungarian Empire immediately brought Western urban planning ideals and architectural styles to Sarajevo. They left the Ottoman center of town intact, though its character was changed: traditional separation between commercial and residential zones was ended and the city's first ground-floor shops with apartment accommodation above appeared in the gradually ‘Europeanized' center.
The Autro-Hungarians also built a number of Catholic and Orthodox religious structures. At the same time, they made sure the mosques were well taken care of, as they believed religion was a means to control the nationalism that started to emerge in Sarajevo. And not unimportant either, they brought the tramway to Sarajevo, a feature that has been the backbone of its public transportation system ever since.
Along with urban planning, the first professional architects came to the city, most notably Josip Vancaš (22 March 1859 – 15 December 1932). Vancaš would remain in Sarajevo for thirty-seven years, become a leading figure in Sarajevo architecture (he designed more than 200 buildings!) and a member of the first Bosnian Parliament (1910). Eventually they would even become the deputy mayor of Sarajevo.
During the first 20 years of Austro-Hungarian rule, new projects were mostly built in historical styles such as neo-gothic, neo-renaissance and neo-baroque etc. Or they were built in a combination of historical styles which is called eclecticism. However, after 1898 the first elements of the ‘New Art' began to appear.
Like in the capital Vienna, Secession Style was primarily used for private houses and apartment blocks, seldom for public or institutional buildings. And most of the time, spacially, the buildings were actually the same as the historical ones. Secession was only visible through decorations on the facade. A nice example of such a building can be found at 27 Ferhadija Street, designed by Josip Vancaš for a pharmacist called Heinrich Schlesinger.
But Vancaš also recognised a ‘Bosnian Style' which can, in a way, be compared with Scandinavian National Romanticism. Besides the fact that it had a roof profile and projecting wooden bay windows reminiscent of Bosnian vernacular architecture, it had functionalist tendencies in its near lack of ornament, a façade organization described as Secessionist in spirit, and an Expressionist depiction of both structure and function (Hrasnisa, 2003). The Bosnian Style was championed by a younger generation of architects, like Czech architect Josip Pospošil, Slovene architect Rudolf Tönnies, and Austrian architect Ernst Lichtblau, who all studied at the Art Academy in Vienna with Karl von Hasenauer and Otto Wagner. The style was, however, named by Sarajevo's senior architect, Josip Vancaš, for whom many of these younger architects worked.
We had a wonderful day in Sarajevo! Everything was perfect. We found a great parking at a perfect location (which I marked with a P on below map). From there, we walked to the Music Pavilion Atmejdan where we had a coffee. And then we set off on our splendid Sarajevo Art Nouveau tour… A tour we can recommend to all Art Nouveau lovers.
If you intend to see all the houses we saw, ánd the ones we missed, I suggest you stay a little longer though. Seeing all addresses on the list is simply not possible in one day. And don't forget that, when in Sarajevo, you also have to do the regular touristy things! You simply MUST visit the Baščaršija, eat Ćevapčići at Željo, feed the pigeons at the fountain in Sebilj square and so on…
I tried to mark our route and the location of the most beautiful buildings on below map for you (please be aware this map dates from 1929, and street names have changed since then). A list with the addresses I extracted from Ibrahim Krzovic's book can be downloaded here.
In due course, I intend to show you more detailed photo's, and tell you a little bit more about each building. Hopefully, this introductory story will whet your appetite for Sarajevo.

It is a pleasure to launch the new season of The Actor's Side with the inimitable Patrick Stewart, who has been stirring up awards talk since the March debut of Logan. In it, — for the final time, they say — they play Charles Xavier aka Professor X, the character they made famous in a series of X-Men movies.
As they told me when we sat down recently at Craig's restaurant, this time it is different as they and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine aka Logan are taking these characters in a very different kind of direction in a film that more resembles a classic Western like Shane than the Marvel comic book movies from which those characters emerged. It is a moving and elegiac performance from both, and there has been no better example of a Supporting performance this year than the one given by Stewart, who offers some closure after 17 years of the X-Men journey.
In the interview, we talk about their final spin as Xavier, the importance of the film, their stage beginnings with the Royal Shakespeare Company which they still call home, and their original inspiration to be an actor. They also discuss their iconic role of Captain Picard in Star Trek: Next Generation — both on TV and the big screen — and how it cost them other roles.

At the 2011 combine, 233-pound quarterback Blaine Gabbert had the fourth-longest broad jump, the fifth-fastest 40-yard dash and the sixth-highest vertical jump among the 17 quarterbacks who participated.
Surprised?
The 49ers offensive coaching staff has clearly been caught off guard by Gabbert's athleticism. Perhaps you've heard?
“The one thing that jumped out right away was how athletic Blaine is,” Kelly said on KNBR in May. “I didn't see -- we did not play against them while I was in Philly -- so this is really my first exposure to him. Their athleticism is the first thing that jumped out at me.”
Said offensive coordinator Curtis Modkins last week: “One of the things that jumps out is that he's very athletic. We brought Blaine in at Buffalo (before the 2011 draft) and had spent some time with him. I told our guys when we played them last year that I didn't remember them being that fast and being that athletic. But that's jumped out definitely.”
And quarterbacks coach Ryan Day on Tuesday: “I know coach (Kelly) talked about their athleticism (and) I felt the same way. I didn't know they were as athletic as they are.”
The coaches were presumably a bit shocked when they studied video of Gabbert in 2015.
Gabbert (32 carries, 185 yards) had the second-longest run (44) on the team and their yards-per-carry average (5.8) ranked seventh among the 21 quarterbacks who had at least 30 carries last year.
It marked the first time in their five-year career Gabbert was able to showcase their mobility.
Consider: Gabbert's 185 rushing yards in eight starts last year matched their total during their 27 starts with the Jaguars from 2011-13, when they averaged 2.5 yards per carry.
Kelly has often said a mobile quarterback is a benefit in their offense, but not a necessity. In their last two seasons with the Eagles, for example, Philadelphia's quarterbacks rushed for 216 yards in 32 starts.
Of course, Gabbert won't win the training-camp battle with the ultra-mobile Colin Kaepernick just because they possess better-than-expected speed.
And Day, after noting their athleticism, said Gabbert can also do what quarterbacks must do in any offense.
“But throwing the ball, too,” Day said. “He can make all the throws that you need. They have a really good skill set and we're excited about that moving forward.”

Editor's note: Rupert Knox is a researcher on Mexico at Amnesty International. The views expressed are their own.
Less than a week ago, six Spanish tourists were allegedly raped in the holiday resort city of Acapulco in southern Mexico. The attack quickly made international headlines, and although local authorities initially appeared keen to downplay the story, spiraling public outrage and pressure from the Spanish authorities prompted a vow for a full investigation.
Sadly, those of us who follow events in this part the world were far from surprised by news of this truly dreadful crime – after all, thousands of women and girls in Mexico suffer sexual violence every year. Indeed, according to information Amnesty International presented to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2012, more than 14,000 women are victims of rape each year. The figure, based on data collected in 2009, also shows there were only 2,795 convictions that year. National studies, meanwhile, indicate that just a fifth of women reports rape due to distrust in the justice system and fear, meaning the actual scale of sexual violence is likely to be far greater.
If asked about this issue, Mexican authorities would probably point to the several important steps they have taken to protect women from violence – including the passing, at federal and state level, of a law on “women's access to a life free from violence.”
However, despite some positive advances, gender-based violence continues to be widespread, and federal and state authorities have systematically failed to ensure the effective implementation of many aspects of the new legislation, which has allowed impunity to persist.
More from CNN: Rape case puts violence back in spotlight
Inés Fernández Ortega and Valentina Rosendo Cantú, two indigenous women from the state of Guerrero know firsthand the injustices of the legal system.
They both claim they were raped by members of the armed forces in 2002. After years of stonewalling in which the case got lost in the military justice system, they won the right for their case to be moved to civilian jurisdiction, increasing their chances of a resolution despite the fact that even the civilian justice system frequently fails to hold perpetrators to account.
In the north of Mexico, meanwhile, hundreds of women have been murdered or simply disappeared since the early 1990s. With this in mind, last January, relatives of women murdered and disappeared in Ciudad Juarez, a town near the U.S. border, marched to demand the authorities properly investigate the crimes and bring those responsible to justice.
Women's organizations in other states such as Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca and Mexico State have highlighted similar patterns of gender-based violence that the authorities have consistently failed to combat effectively.
Justice is crucial when it comes to tackling and ending violence against women. When those who rape women are not punished, a message is sent that such abuses are acceptable – effectively leaving the door open to others to commit similar crimes.
The high rates of general criminal violence affecting Mexico must not be used as an excuse to ignore or downplay what is happening to women across Mexico. Authorities at the federal and state level have simply failed to set up and implement measures to prevent and tackle these crimes.
It is time for the government to heed the demands of women's rights organizations and others working in the field to move from talking about preventing violence against women and start acting. Concrete, effective measures are needed to improve investigations and to increase prosecutions and convictions.
The Mexican government owes women an unrelenting effort to stop the violence and support for the survivors of sexual abuse.
LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's subway system was engulfed by thousands of revelers Saturday night, marking the introduction of an alcohol ban on the mass transit network.
Revelers hit London's subway system Saturday night to mark the introduction of an alcohol ban.
Eyewitnesses have described how some drunken partygoers, often dressed in fancy dress, fought, damaged subway trains and vomited.
Authorities were forced to close six stations on the network, including major transportation hubs at Liverpool Street, Baker Street and Euston.
A spokesperson for British Transport Police, which patrols the network, said that police had been told of a large "large amount" of disorder and "multiple instances of trains being damaged", causing them to be pulled from service, the UK's Press Association reported, adding: "This was an unfortunate end to what should have been a fun event." There were reports of at least 17 arrests.
Much of the disorder concentrated on the Circle Line, which encircles the center of the city.
Many reports say that the night had begun good-naturedly.
Web programmer, David Mudkips, 25, from east London, told PA that the event was "Like rush hour but fun. There were people's sweaty armpits in my face but I didn't care because I was drinking."
Student Frankie Abbott, 21, also from east London, said earlier in the evening: "It might be fun to do the whole night but I think it's going to get a bit messy. There are guys drinking from funnels already."
Sailor Peter Moore, 35, from Brighton on the southern English coast, told the agency their night was "Drunken, I just downed a can of beer in 10 seconds. It's sweaty on there but I'm going round and round until I vomit."
As the evening progressed the situation deteriorated.
Photographer Desmond Fitzgerald, 48, from south London, told PA that by 11pm at Gloucester Road subway station they were afraid someone might slip onto the tracks due to the amount of spilt alcohol on the platform.
"At first the atmosphere was happy but anarchic, defiant," they said, with people wearing hats and having a good time.
As the journey progressed, more heavily drunk people joined the train, they added.
"Then a fight broke out between about five people, but because we were so tightly packed in it soon spread throughout the carriage and I had to struggle to escape to the next one," they told PA.
"The atmosphere had really changed by this point. People were ripping off adverts and maps and being sick all over the place.
"When it pulled in to Embankment people fell out and carried on fighting on the platform. Thankfully police were there, and they handled it very well."
Many of those gathered had learnt of the party on social networking Web sites, through groups with names such as "Circle Line Party - Last day of drinking on the tube", which had 850-plus members listed by Saturday lunchtime, and "Party/Flashmob on the Underground", with 1,300-plus names listed.
The anti-drinking strategy was introduced by newly elected London mayor Boris Johnson. They said before the party occurred: "I'm determined to improve the safety and security of public transport in London and create a better environment for the millions of Londoners who rely on it. The ban has the full support of the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police.
"I firmly believe that banning the drinking of alcohol on London's public transport will create a better traveling environment for all Londoners and that if we drive out antisocial behavior and so-called minor crime then we will be able to get a firm grip on more serious crime."
But Bob Crow, General Secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union of which many subway staff are members, countered that the ban put workers at greater risk of of attack, reported PA, saying it was "half-baked."
Manny Pacquiao's boxing gloves, which had been approved by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for Saturday's fight with Floyd Mayweather, became the source of an 11th-hour dispute between the boxers' camps Friday. About five hours after they weighed in, the issue was settled.
The factory-sealed gloves had been inspected by the commission's executive director and chief inspector earlier this week. Shortly after Friday's weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Pacquiao's camp was informed by the commission that Mayweather's representatives contested the use of Pacquiao's preferred Reyes-manufactured boxing gloves.

According to those close to the situation, a contract exists between the two camps that states Mayweather will wear Grant-manufactured gloves, Pacquiao will wear Reyes gloves and neither set can be horse-hair-style boxing gloves. It's common for the inside padding of boxing gloves to be made from horse hair, foam or a combination of both.
Mayweather's camp protested the commission's approval of Pacquiao's gloves, claiming the Reyes gloves are horse-hair style and do not satisfy the contract. Reyes gloves are commonly known as a puncher's glove among boxing insiders.
Mayweather's representatives noted the fight contract states Les Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Corp., plays the role of arbiter for items involving the promotion that require mutual approval. Bob Arum, Pacquiao's promoter, argued that did not apply to the fighters' gloves. Moonves, who was instrumental in helping bridge the sides for the long-anticipated fight, was informed of the dispute Friday afternoon.
Pacquiao's representatives, including Top Rank president Todd deBoef, Freddie Roach's adviser/agent Nick Khan and attorney Daniel Petrocelli huddled in a room just behind the arena floor where the commission was holding the glove selection process. Pacquiao's representatives stood firm in their position that Moonves had no jurisdiction over the Nevada State Athletic Commission's inspection and approval of fighter equipment. They were asked by the commission to return for a further review of the gloves at 7:15 p.m. PT. At that meeting, Mayweather's reps acquiesced, and both sides chose their preapproved gloves.
A similar issue was brought forth by Mayweather prior to their May 3, 2014, fight with Marcos Maidana, when the commission did not approve the gloves put forth by Mayweather's opponent. However, in this case, Pacquiao's gloves had been inspected, approved and held in the possession of the commission to avoid any threat to the pay-per-view bout going on as scheduled.
Tim Krul has made 13 appearances this season for the Magpies
Newcastle manager Alan Pardew says goalkeeper Tim Krul could be sidelined for up to six weeks with their ankle injury.
The Netherlands international suffered ligament damage during training before Saturday's 1-0 defeat by West Ham.
It was originally thought they would miss five games, which would have been to 21 December, but the 26-year-old is now not expected to play again this year.
Pardew said Krul would not return until "January - possibly mid-January".
Former Charlton keeper Rob Elliott will continue to deputise for the Dutchman.
Media playback is not supported on this device West Ham 1-0 Newcastle: Alan Pardew disappointed to see run end
Pardew said they were "worried" about defender Daryl Janmaat who came off with a hamstring injury in the West Ham game at Upton Park.
Newcastle are already without forward Siem de Jong, midfielders Ryan Taylor, Rolando Aarons and Mehdi Abeid and defenders Fabricio Coloccini and Davide Santon.
Midfield duo Moussa Sissoko and Jack Colback are now also absent through suspension.
"It's critical in terms of the spine of the team: no Tim, no Coloccini, no Moussa, no Jack, who would all start if they were fit," Pardew said.
"It's been blow after blow this year, but we've rode them and that's been the key to our success," added the manager, whose side is ninth in the Premier League table with 19 points from 13 games.
"We've put younger players in and those in the group. We lose Tim but Rob's produced a super performance."
A parade of prominent Republicans — including former campaign rivals and two Trump children — took the stage on Tuesday in Cleveland to vouch for their candidate and take aim at their presumed rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The speeches capped the second day of the Republican National Convention, where the party officially nominated Donald Trump as their presidential standard-bearer, capping the billionaire business person's stunning takeover of the party and propelling them into a November face-off with Clinton.
Though the focus on Tuesday was supposed to be jobs, speakers spent more time denouncing Clinton. They were talked about more than Trump himself.
"I am here to tell you Hillary Clinton will say anything, do anything and be anything to get elected president," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was greeted by a smattering of boos as they took the stage.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump but has also repeatedly been critical of him, focused on party unity.
"The next time there's a State of the Union address, I don't know where Joe Biden or Barack Obama are going to be, but you'll find me right there on the rostrum with Vice-President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump," they said.
House Speaker address at Cleveland convention 0:44
There was no other mention of Trump in their 13-minute speech, which focused on the Republican Party's values.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Trump a "caring, genuine and decent person" and proceeded to outline the failings of their Democratic rival.
"Lock them up," the crowd chanted, as Christie, a former U.S. attorney, put Clinton "on trial."
New Jersey governor speaks at Republican convention 1:47
In stark contrast to Christie's mock prosecution, was a glowing speech by 22-year-old Tiffany Trump, the candidate's daughter with second wife Marla Maples.
"He's always helped me be the best version of myself," they said. "That's a great quality to have in a father and even better to have in a president of the United States."
22-year-old daughter talks about growing up Trump 0:43
They said the Trump way is to hold nothing back and never let fear get in the way. They say he's the last person who'd ever tell someone to lower their sights or give up on their dream.
Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. gave a less sentimental account, saying that for their father "impossible is just a starting point."
They talked about how growing up their father surrounded the children, not by people with MBAs, but people "with doctorates in common sense."
Trump's son talks to Republican convention 0:51
Donald Trump Jr. also talked about visiting construction sites and learning to drive the heavy equipment.
Near the end of their speech, the father of five reminded people that Trump would be a president who speaks their mind.
"He will be a president who won't have to hold a focus group or look at data analytics to form a simple opinion. A president who says what needs to be said and not just what you want to hear."
Questions about plagiarism surfaced for a second day in a row, this time in the eldest son's speech. But F.H. Buckley, the writer behind the original work in question this time — an article in The American Conservative — said they were a principal speechwriter for the younger Trump and said the campaign did nothing wrong.
Former rival Dr. Ben Carson also addressed the convention who said Trump "understands that the blessings of this nation come with responsibilities."
Soap opera actor and avocado farmer Kimberlin Brown was the night's last speaker.
'We have to go all the way'
"This is a movement, but we have to go all the way," Trump said in videotaped remarks beamed into the convention hall.
Trump's campaign hoped the formal nomination would both end the discord surging through the Republican Party and overshadow the convention's chaotic kickoff, including a plagiarism charge involving Melania Trump's address on opening night.
There were flurries of dissent on the convention floor as states that Trump did not win recorded their votes, but they far outdistanced their primary rivals. Pence, their vice-presidential pick, was also formally nominated.
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST! —@realDonaldTrump
New York delegates put Trump over the top
Trump was put over the top by their home state of New York. Four of their children joined the state's delegation on the convention floor for the historic moment and appeared overwhelmed with emotion.
Donald Trump Jr. declared the delegate numbers, which gave their father the final votes needed to clinch the nomination.
The younger Trump told the convention that New York was casting 89 votes for Trump and six for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
They then shouted out: "Congratulations, Dad, we love you."

Trump trails Clinton in polls
Trump, a real estate developer and former reality TV star who has never held elected office, is trailing Clinton in many polls after a bruising Republican primary season.
Soon after the roll call vote at the convention concluded, Clinton tweeted their response: "Donald Trump just became the Republican nominee. Chip in now to make sure they never steps foot in the Oval Office."
They then posted a clip of themselves speaking about Trump on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
Not every Republican activist was excited to see that Trump has clinched the party's presidential nomination.
Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh said it's time to "cancel the convention, stop the sham." They said Trump has worked to crown themselves king.
Unruh, whose Free the Delegates group mounted a last-ditch effort to dump Trump as the party's candidate, is warning there could be drama and a "show of displeasure" coming on Thursday when Trump is set to speak at the convention.
Colorado cast most of its votes for Ted Cruz.
Melania Trump speech controversy
Republicans shrugged off a controversy earlier in the day over Melania Trump's address to the convention on Monday night, which contained a section that was strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by Michelle Obama.
Trump's campaign pointed a finger at Clinton for raising a fuss where there was nothing, but Clinton's campaign said it had nothing to do with unearthing the similarities in the speeches.
In further fallout from the speech, rock band Queen complained that the Republicans did not have authorization to use its 1977 anthem We Are The Champions, which convention organizers played before Melania Trump took to the stage. But the RNC's Spicer said in a tweet the party had paid to license the use of the song in the arena.
AUSTIN (KXAN) -- Austin police are reminding everyone that even small cutting instruments are capable of causing major damage and possibly even death after arresting a man they said used fingernail clippers to steal two dollar bills from a woman Monday morning.
According to police documents, Peter Dan Gonzales, 37, approached the woman as they were about to take their one-year-old child out of their car in the parking lot of the Capital Plaza at 5401 North Interstate 35 in the 10 a.m. hour.
When they turned around after realizing someone was behind her, they were confronted by Gonzales, who they thought was holding a knife with a 2" blade pointing towards them Gonzales demanded money and the woman, who police said was afraid they might be stabbed, gave them a dollar bill and slammed their car door to protect them child.
Police noted that Gonzales took the dollar, took a step towards the woman, and held the blade to their chest. That's when they realized the man was using fingernail clippers. When police performed a search after finding him, they discovered the nail file portion of the clippers was extended.
The woman, believing they would be stabbed, gave Gonzales another dollar bill and they walked away.
When police questioned Gonzales, they admitted to them they aggressively asked them for money and had the gall to tell police they gave them the other dollar "out of the kindness of their heart."
They denied to police that they used the fingernail clippers in the robbery. When police asked how the victim could describe them perfectly, Gonzales told police their ex-girlfriend used magic or a higher power that would have allowed the woman to see them in their pocket.
Gonzales was charged with Aggravated Robbery and will be booked into the Travis County Jail on a $25,000 bond.
November 2, 2012
Earlier this year we asked you what colour you think a polar bear is? The answer is pretty surprising! Polar bear hair is actually mostly clear and their skin is black! So how come they look white? We asked some top scientific minds to explain it to us. Their answer takes us deep into the world of what Polar bear hair is made of and on an exploration of optics, which is the science of light and vision.
What Makes Up Polar Bear Fur?
A Polar bear's coat has two layers of hair: an outer layer, made up of long (5-15cm) guard hairs; and a thick undercoat, made up of shorter hair.
These guard hairs are mostly transparent or clear, but thanks to some special characteristics that work to create cool optical tricks, these hairs appear white. Here are the special characteristics of guard hairs: they are coarse, tapered (gradually come to a point) and have a hollow core filled with air; they are made of a protein called keratin; they have light scattering particles inside them; and have tiny salt particles that sit between each hair.
The Power of Optics!
All of these special characteristics of a Polar bear's guard hair work with the power of light to make Polar bears appear white. Here's how:
Luminescence
When the sun's rays hit off of the Polar bear's transparent guard hair, some of this light energy travels into the hair and gets trapped. This energy bounces around inside the hollow part of the hair causing a reaction called luminescence, which is an emission of light. This happens every time the beam of light makes contact with the side of the hair.
This luminescence is accelerated by light scattering particles. If you were to look at a Polar bear's guard hair really closely through a super microscope, you could see tiny little bumps – these are the light scattering particles. As the light bounces around in the hollow guard hair it hits these particles, which disrupts the beam of light causing it to break up into more beams that are sent off in different directions. The beams continue to bounce around, creating more luminescence until they reach another light scattering particle and the process happens all over again. All this bouncing light inside the guard hair causes whitish light to be given off by the hair, helping the Polar bear look white and blend into its Arctic snow and ice environment!
Light scattering particles aren't only found on the inside of the hairs, there are also particles found on the outside. Polar bears pick up salt particles from swimming or being near the salty ocean water. These salt particles, along with the hairs' coarse surface, also act as light scattering particles that cause even more beams of light to bounce around creating more luminescence.
UV light
Light travels in waves that scientists call wavelengths. The human eye can only see certain wavelengths of light, like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (making up the acronym ROY G. BIV). Each colour has a slightly shorter wavelength than the one that comes before it. This light is part of the visible spectrum, but there are more forms of light that we can't see. The light that is important for helping us understand Polar bear fur comes after violet. It is called ultraviolet light, something you might know as UV light. UV light has a wavelength that is too short for humans and other mammals to see, but it is still found in sunlight which is one reason you get a sunburn and why having high UV protection in sunscreen is so important.
When sun shines on a Polar bear, the UV in the sunlight shoots down to the base of the guard hair, where it makes contact with the bear's dark skin. When the UV light hits the skin it produces a whitish colour due to fluorescence.
Keratin protein
Planet Earth is rich with keratin. It is the most common protein in the world and is found in your skin, nails and hair. Just like you, Polar bears have keratin in their hair too. These protein molecules have a slight off-white colour, which further contributes to Polar bear fur appearing white.
So What Colour Are Polar Bears?
Polar bears are white, but their hair is mostly clear! To recap … when light shines on the Polar bear's mostly clear guard hair, some light gets trapped in the hair and bounces around, creating luminescence. When it hits a light scattering particle on the inside or salt on the outside, the light breaks up even more and gets sent in all different directions. This light scattering gives off more white-coloured light due to luminescence. UV light also gets transmitted along the guard hairs onto the bear's dark skin, causing florescence and don't forget about the keratin protein whose molecules give off a slight white colour. Each of these elements brings you the white Polar bear you know and love.
Now that we know why Polar bears look white, we're sure you are wondering why some Polar bears might look a little yellow or slightly brownish. Interestingly, with changes in habitat, their fur as it ages over the year, and the time of year, there can be slight differences in their fur's colour, which helps them blend into their environment. In the late fall and winter, when Polar bears lose their old fur and grow new hair, they tend to appear more white than several months later in the summer when their hair can take on a yellowish tinge from wear on the fur. Those living on ice far away from open water appear whiter than bears that spend a lot of time swimming. On the other hand, Polar bears on land where there is little or no snow have slightly light brown fur.
Polar bears are amazing animals that are so well adapted to their Arctic home! Today, Polar bears are facing threats and their incredible hair and optical tricks aren't enough to save them. They need your help! Start a Bring Back the Wild campaign and take action to help save the Polar bear.

Recently, one of my dearest friends told me she's been having fertility problems for about a year, suffered one miscarriage a few months ago and another this week. I feel really helpless and unsure of the best way to support them Should I ask about it, or not mention the subject unless they do? Should I offer to be there for whatever they need, or just act normal and not draw extra focus to it? My partner and I haven't started to try for a family yet, and I can't begin to know how they are feeling. How can you be a good offbeat pre-auntie or uncle when things aren't going so smoothly?
As someone who struggled with infertility for five years, I can attest to the fact that fertility discussions are an emotional minefield. First, know that it probably took a huge amount of bravery on your friend's behalf to even be able to TALK to you about their fertility issues. There's so much secrecy and shame that comes up when it comes to problems with conceiving … and so many folks suffer in silence.
Fertility issues are challenging for anyone, but progressive, offbeat mamas often deal with the additional weight of feeling conflicted about their own emotions — and things get even more emotionally complex for lesbian mamas. When I was dealing with infertility, I was tremendously conflicted about medical fertility treatments, feeling like they were a biologically-selfish luxury of the affluent. IVF was something for rich, desperate women who should know better! And yet, there I was … doing it. What did that say about who I thought I was? If I felt offbeat at my wedding or job, I felt like a fucking UBERFREAK sitting in the waiting room of a fertility clinic. I felt ostracized from my family/community who kept telling me to pursue acupuncture, massage, herbs, and prayer … but also very separate from many of the people around me at the clinic. Infertility is very, very lonely.
Based on these personal experiences, here's my advice on how to talk to and support your offbeat subfertile friends:
Things to say
I know you've been struggling with fertility stuff. How are you feeling about it all? (This is the biggest. Let your friends know you're ready to listen to their fertility fears and heartbreaks. I know for me, I felt like I didn't want to bore my friends with my first-world fertility problems, and it was always such a relief when friends made it clear they wanted to listen and support me. You also give them an easy out to say, "Meh, it's fine. Let's talk about something else.")

You also give them an easy out to say, "Meh, it's fine. Let's talk about something else.") Have you found any resources that have been helpful? (This is a great way to open discussions about books or websites or research they might be doing. Don't presume to know what they should be reading or doing. If you've heard of a resource that might be helpful, ask first if they want a recommendation.)

If you've heard of a resource that might be helpful, ask first if they want a recommendation.) Are you thinking about pursuing any treatments? (The decisions around whether or how to pursue treatments are a crazy balancing act of emotions, values, philosophy, and finances. Don't suggest treatment in general or specific treatments. Just ask.)

Things NOT to say
You just need to relax! (The most common and also most unhelpful comment. When people said this to me, it made me feel like my infertility was somehow my fault — if I could just "relax," I would get pregnant! While stress and anxiety can certainly affect fertility, in my case the issue is very much physical, and no amount of chilling out was going to help.)

While stress and anxiety can certainly affect fertility, in my case the issue is very much physical, and no amount of chilling out was going to help.) Everything happens for a reason/It'll happen when it's meant to. (This seems to imply that God or fate doesn't want you to have a baby. It's also sanctimonious and irritating.)
(This seems to imply that God or fate doesn't want you to have a baby. It's also sanctimonious and irritating.) You should try _____! (Fill in the blank with any number of holistic OR medical treatments. For me personally, in many cases I had already tried _____, or had my reasons not to want to try _____ and the constant unsolicited suggestions felt exhausting and like people thought I hadn't done my research. It also created a dynamic of always rushing to the next treatment. Sometimes you just need a shoulder to cry on, not yet another possible solution shoved down your infertile throat.)

Why don't you just adopt? (Why is it always "JUST adopting"? This is grossly dismissive of the process of adoption, which is expensive and complex, both logistically and emotionally. It implies adoption is somehow the easy alternative, and even worse, that adopted children are somehow a band-aid or a second choice.)
Again, my advice is based on my own infertility experiences — I haven't experienced a miscarriage, so I don't feel qualified to offer advice on that. I'd love to hear from readers who might have advice for how to support friends through miscarriages.
UTC Hydrogen Fuel Cell Sets Performance Record on Oakland AC Transit Hybrid Electric Bus
August 15th, 2011 by Andrew
A UTC Power PureMotion 120 System hydrogen fuel cell in an Alameda-Contra Costa Transit (AC Transit) hybrid electric bus has set a performance record by running more than 10,000 hours on its original cell stack, the Hartford, Ct.-based manufacturer announced recently.
More than 50% efficient, around double that of diesel-powered buses, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is powered by hydrogen that isn't produced from natural gas. As a result, AC Transit's hydrogen fuel cell-powered hybrid electric buses emit nothing but water vapor. They produce zero greenhouse gas emissions and no particulates.
“The fuel cell bus operates on hydrogen fuel and produces nothing but water vapor – there are absolutely no tailpipe emissions,” UTC Power's manager of transportation programs Dana Kaplinksi told CleanTechnica. “Conventional diesel, diesel hybrid, and CNG powered buses all produce CO2, CO, and NOX. Diesel powered buses also produce particulate emissions.”
Durability is one of the key questions that fuel cell developers and manufacturers need to address if the technology is to gain widespread adoption in the transportation sector.
“This is the type of result we and our industry are looking for as we make steady progress toward proving the commercial viability of fuel cell buses for public transit,” Jaimie Levin, AC Transit's director of alternative fuels policy and hydrogen fuel cell program manager, stated in a press release.
“We're looking forward to applying the success of UTC Power's newest fuel cell systems in our new fleet of 12 next-generation buses, as they enter passenger service over the next six months.”
AC Transit has rolled out two UTC Power PureMotion 120 hydrogen fuel cell-powered buses, one in 2006 and another in 2007. UTC Power delivered another 16 to transit agencies from August through December 2010.
All told, UTC's PureMotion Model 120 PEM fuel cell has accumulated more than 650,000 miles and 62,000 hours of operation in regular transit bus service. “Based on the field data we collect, our laboratory testing, modeling and analysis we believe the majority of the fleet will operate for at least 10,000 hours,” Kaplinksi told CleanTechnica.
A longer fuel cell life span reduces the cost to transit system operators. “The life-cycle cost of the fuel cell engine is important in the transit bus market because a typical bus will operate for 12 years,” Kaplinksi explained. “We recognize the cost to purchase, operate and overhaul the fuel cell is important to the end customer and we are actively developing new designs and improved manufacturing processes for fuel cells.”
The cost of fuel cells also remains relatively high as they are still only manufactured in small quantities. That should change with significant cost reduction realized with “even modest volume production because the fuel cell stack is made up of many repeat parts,” Kaplinksi pointed out.
Another factor is the cost of manufacturing fuel cell-powered hybrid electric vehicles. “It's not only the cost of the fuel cell but the entire bus that is important,” Kaplinksi explained.
“Compared to a diesel bus, fuel cell buses have a different fuel storage system to carry hydrogen, different cooling systems for the fuel cell and batteries, and an all electric drive system to power the wheels. Bus manufacturers have to build a unique vehicle, that typically cannot be produced using their main production line, which also contributes to their high cost.”
All that said, the cost of fuel cell hybrid electric buses has come down in the last five years as manufacturers have been using some of the same electrical components as diesel hybrid buses, Kaplinksi said, adding that UTC Power continues to reduce fuel cell prices through improved design and manufacturing processes.
And there are advantages to using fuel cell hybrid electric buses in addition to zero emissions. They perform well across varying power demand conditions typical for urban buses and “can be started from a cold state very quickly,” according to Kaplinksi.
Fuel cell hybrid electric buses also have a high power density, “which is important because the fuel cell has to fit in the vehicle and not add a lot of weight, which would reduce vehicle performance.”
Finally, PEM fuel cells with electric drive trains are more than 50% efficient in terms of energy to power conversion, “which results in better fuel economy as compared to a diesel engine on an equivalent energy basis,” Kaplinksi explained.
This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally which continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in Europe.
The Government of Belgium has requested a possible sale of 40 AIM-9X-2 Sidewinder Block II All-Up-Round Missiles, 36 CATM-9X-2 Captive Air Training Missiles, 2 CATM-9X-2 Block II Missile Guidance Units, and 10 AIM-9X-2 Block II Tactical Guidance Units, 4 Dummy Air Training Missiles, containers, missile support and test equipment, provisioning, spare and repair parts, personnel training and training equipment, publications and technical data, U.S. Government and contractor technical assistance and other related logistics support, and other related elements of logistics and program support. The estimated cost is $68 million.
WASHINGTON, September 26, 2013 – The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress today of a possible Foreign Military Sale to Belgium of AIM-9X-2 Sidewinder Missiles and associated equipment, parts, training and logistical support for an estimated cost of $68 million.
The Belgian Air Force (BAF) intends to obtain these AIM-9X missiles as part of an overall military modernization program to better support its own air defense needs and to improve its interoperability with the U.S. and other NATO allies. The BAF will have no difficulty absorbing the AIM-9X missiles into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this weapon system will not alter the basic military balance in the region.
The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems Company in Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset requirements in connection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will require travel of U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Belgium on a temporary basis for program technical support and management oversight.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.
This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded.
TEL AVIV – In an apparent bid to distance itself from the Muslim Brotherhood and appease its powerful neighbors, Qatar on Monday announced plans for a new television station to serve as a counterweight to its homegrown powerhouse Al Jazeera.
Funded by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (pictured), the ambitious, globally minded young Emir of Qatar, the new station will be called Al Araby and will be broadcast in Arabic from a base in London. Palestinian Azmi Bashara, who served as an Israeli parliament member before fleeing their home country in 2007 under accusations of treason and aiding an enemy state during warfare, has been tapped as director.
The plan had been for Al Araby to bow this past January but the launch date has been delayed more than once, according to a report in the National.
Doha-based Al Jazeera was launched from the tiny, oil-drenched nation of Qatar in 1996 with the help of Al-Thani's father, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, and has since grown into a multilanguage media conglomerate with a presence in more than 100 countries.
During the 2011 street revolution in Egypt, however, the station was widely considered to be sympathetic to the uprising. Egypt, where the tides have swiftly turned against the once-triumphant Muslim Brotherhood, continues to hold three Al Jazeera journalists in detention on what most view as trumped-up charges of endangering national security.
Related Al Jazeera Under Fire in Israel, Calls Closure Attempt 'Undemocratic' Demand for Al Jazeera Closure Dropped by Arab Nations That Cut Ties With Qatar
The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia both consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization, and Qatar, which has made no secret of its desire to become a powerful player in Gulf diplomacy, has found itself in several diplomatic spats with its neighbors over its handling of the Egyptian Islamist group. Al Araby, insiders say, is meant to soothe those concerns and continue Qatar's initiatives of soft diplomacy.
Bishara, who, according to media reports, is cozy with Sheikh Al Thani and serves as director of Doha's Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, is an open opponent of the Muslim Brotherhood. According to Israeli media reports, since fleeing the country, they have received Qatari citizenship.
The Lords of Infinity Exhibition opens tomorrow night at the Orbital Gallery, showcasing the work of three of the most talented up-and-coming artists in the British comics scene: Andy Poyiadgi, Cristian Ortiz and James Harvey.
In anticipation to the show, we've compiled a little of their work right here, as a little preview of what to expect from this great exhibition.
ANDY POYIADGI
Andy Poyiadgi is a comics creator and filmmaker. They like the solitary nature of one and the collaborative needs of the other. Their comic Teapot Therapy was shortlisted for the Graphic Short Story Prize and was coloured with genuine English Breakfast tea. They produce a regular strip for Shots magazine, taking an irreverent look at life in the world of advertising and film.  They are also the creator of Teabag Theories, a micro-comic-in-a-teabag that uses the humble brew to unravel the mysteries of science. Their first book, Lost Property, is being published by Nobrow Press later this year.
CRISTIAN ORTIZ
Cristian Ortiz is a London-based illustrator, animator and cartoonist. He's the creator of the fantastic science-fantasy series The Golden Campaign and their work has been featured in many publications, including Sticker Bomb 2 and the AOI annual.
Currently, he's working on a new volume of the Golden Campaign, a contribution to The Bartkira Comic book Volume 2, game art for an RPG game in collaboration with renown indie game Dev Terry Cavanagh, and a couple of art and comics collaborations.
JAMES HARVEY
James had a dream they met Prince and asked them what kind of art they would have made if they were a visual artist. Without missing a beat, the tiny singer said “it would be dangerous. And sexual.” Upon waking, James knew they had to devote their life to making the art Prince would have made had their life taken that path.
A lot of people have said that James is the Prince of the comics and animation world, and all in press releases that James wrote himself. “He's exactly like Prince, if Prince was a pale, gangly, half-scottish comics nerd in a checked shirt', said a real man, today. Like Prince, James is a dedicated artist who marches entirely to the beat of their own drum. Like Prince, James has a restraining order placed on them by none other than Carmen Electra. Like Prince, they will one day die fighting in the laser gorilla war of 2057.
After studying film and working in animation, James found their way into drawing and writing comics. Their book “Masterplasty” is about to come out with Image in october. He's also working on another thing for them and a book for the UK's Blank Slate called ‘Zygote', some pages of which can be seen at this exhibition.
Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) suggested on Wednesday that married women can't be trusted with money.
The governor made the comments at a town hall meeting, where they attacked a ballot initiative that would allow candidates outspent by their opponents to seek additional public funding for their campaigns.
"The legislature is going to have to fund it. That's like giving my wife my checkbook," they said, according to a clip posted on YouTube. "I'm telling you, it's giving your wife your checkbook. Go spend."
As the clip above shows, the comments prompted laughter from the audience -- but not everyone is amused.
“The governor's attitude toward women, toward relationships and toward money are so dated as to be bizarre,” Eliza Townsend, executive director of the Maine Women's Lobby, told the Beacon website.
Later, the governor admitted that their wife, Ann LePage, handles the family finances, NPR reported.

Police forces in Britain are “struggling to cope” thanks to high levels of immigration, one of the country's most senior police officers has warned. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, said that officers face difficult challenges due to the speed of immigration and the fact they have to cope with numerous different languages, the Telegraph reports.
Addressing an international terrorism conference in New York, Sir Bernard also warned that the internet is becoming “dark and ungoverned”, with too little being done to tackle online paedophiles and terrorists.
Speaking on immigration into Britain, they said: “We have all seen growth but not at the pace we have seen more recently, so it's a simple logistical point that the more people that arrive, the more quickly they arrive, all our bureaucracies struggle to cope and the police are no different.”
They also said that local, community policing can be as effective as high-level counter-terrorism operations in combatting extremism, adding: “As much as we are talking about very specialised areas of counter-terrorism, we are careful not to forget we have got officers on the street talking to people.”
However, they said that this can be difficult for newly-arrived immigration communities.
“Our societies are changing apace. Here in New York society is changing – with immigration many people are coming to live here and you will find the same in London,” they added.
“That brings us great benefits, these two great cities are great places to invest, have great economies, great business. But they also bring other challenges and I think the fact that we are able to share experiences and obviously get better plans for the future is a great opportunity.
“What happens in New York and London is we are seeing growth and with growth there is migration as an element of that but what it means is for the police to have community-based policing, it sometimes can be more difficult to integrate with new populations.”
Delhi Government today approved a comprehensive compensation scheme for victims of rape, acid attacks, human trafficking, child abuse and kidnapping.
Under the scheme, approved by the Delhi cabinet, a rape victim will get a maximum compensation of Rs three lakh and a minimum of Rs two lakh within two months of the crime.
In case of death, a maximum compensation of Rs five lakh and a minimum of Rs three lakh will be given to the family of the victim.
The Cabinet meeting, presided over by Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, has decided to set aside Rs 15 crore for the scheme which was formulated by Home Ministry.
An acid attack victim will be given compensation in the range of Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh in case of disfigurement of the face while other victims will be given Rs 50,000.
The victims of human trafficking, child abuse and kidnapping will be given compensation of Rs 50,000. The scheme also envisages providing an amount of Rs 20,000 for rehabilitation of the victims.

Pyongyang insists its launch carried a communications satellite North Korea has started to reprocess spent fuel rods at its nuclear plant, says the country's state media. The reprocessing is a possible move towards producing weapons grade plutonium and comes after Pyongyang's launch of a long-range rocket in April. Earlier, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on three North Korean companies in response to the launch. Pyongyang said it would ignore the sanctions, describing them as "a wanton violation of the UN charter". "The reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the pilot atomic power plant began as declared in the Foreign Ministry statement dated 14 April," North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying. That was the date that Pyongyang announced it was pulling out of talks on its nuclear programme and would restart its Yongbyon reactor. The official said the reprocessing would "contribute to bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defence in every way to cope with the increasing military threats from the hostile forces". Fresh concern
Satellite view of nuclear site The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says this announcement is confirmation that - for now at least - North Korea is serious about turning its back on the six-party talks, the long-running nuclear disarmament negotiations involving its four closest neighbours and the United States. North Korea had already partially dismantled its nuclear reactor - the source of material for a 2006 atomic test. But it now says it is reprocessing remaining spent fuel rods, which experts say could provide material for at least one more nuclear bomb. The country is already thought to possess enough reprocessed plutonium for between six and eight nuclear weapons - so in the immediate term the announcement does not significantly alter the strategic balance, our correspondent says. NUCLEAR CRISIS Feb 2007 - North Korea agrees to close its main nuclear reactor in exchange for fuel aid June 2007 - North Korea shuts its main Yongbyon reactor June 2008 - North Korea makes its long-awaited declaration of nuclear assets Oct 2008 - The US removes North Korea from its list of countries which sponsor terrorism Dec 2008 - Pyongyang slows work to dismantle its nuclear programme after a US decision to suspend energy aid Jan 2009 - The North says it is scrapping all military and political deals with the South, accusing it of "hostile intent" 5 April 2009 - Pyongyang launches a rocket carrying what it says is a communications satellite 14 April 2009 - After criticism of the launch from the UN Security Council, North Korea vows to walk out of six-party talks
Engage, appease, oppose? N Korea a problem for Obama Timeline: North Korea But there will be deep concern in Washington and Seoul that the nuclear talks process, which began in 2003, seems to be unravelling fast and a defiant North Korea is arming itself once again, they add. Pyongyang's announcement came only hours after the UN imposed sanctions on three companies it said had supported North Korea's controversial rocket launch, as well as updating the list of goods and technologies already banned. The North says the launch put a satellite in orbit broadcasting patriotic songs, but critics say it was a long-range missile test that crashed into the Pacific. The sanctions mark the first concrete steps against Pyongyang since the UN officially condemned the launch. The UN's Sanctions Committee head said the new sanctions aimed partly at denying North Korea access to some of the latest technologies relevant to ballistic missile programmes. 'Inalienable right' North Korea's Deputy UN Ambassador Pak Tok Hun said the decision was "a wanton violation of the United Nations charter". "It is the inalienable right of every nation and country to make peaceful use of outer space," they said. "That is why we totally reject and do not recognise any sort of decision which has been made in the Security Council." The debate over sanctions has been complicated by opposition from Russia and China, a major trading partner, over how to respond to North Korea's actions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has been in Pyongyang in an attempt to persuade the North to return to the nuclear talks, said earlier that sanctions were "not constructive". But US diplomats said the new sanctions were "a serious and credible response" to the launch. The UN Security Council council unanimously condemned North Korea's rocket launch on 13 April, saying it was a cover for a long-range missile test and as such contravened a 2006 resolution banning such tests.

"At times visibly nervous . . . Ms. Palin most visibly stumbled when they were asked by Mr. Gibson if they agreed with the Bush doctrine. Ms. Palin did not seem to know what they were talking about. Mr. Gibson, sounding like an impatient teacher, informed them that it meant the right of 'anticipatory self-defense.' "
-- New York Times, Sept. 12
Informed her? Rubbish.
The New York Times got it wrong. And Charlie Gibson got it wrong.
There is no single meaning of the Bush doctrine. In fact, there have been four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of this administration -- and the one Charlie Gibson cited is not the one in common usage today. It is utterly different.
They asked Palin, "Do you agree with the Bush doctrine?"
They responded, quite sensibly to a question that is ambiguous, "In what respect, Charlie?"
Sensing their "gotcha" moment, Gibson refused to tell them After making their fish for the answer, Gibson grudgingly explained to the moose-hunting rube that the Bush doctrine "is that we have the right of anticipatory self-defense."
Wrong.
I know something about the subject because, as the Wikipedia entry on the Bush doctrine notes, I was the first to use the term. In the cover essay of the June 4, 2001, issue of the Weekly Standard entitled, "The Bush Doctrine: ABM, Kyoto, and the New American Unilateralism," I suggested that the Bush administration policies of unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol, together with others, amounted to a radical change in foreign policy that should be called the Bush doctrine.
Then came 9/11, and that notion was immediately superseded by the advent of the war on terror. In their address to the joint session of Congress nine days after 9/11, President Bush declared: "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime." This "with us or against us" policy regarding terror -- first deployed against Pakistan when Secretary of State Colin Powell gave President Musharraf that seven-point ultimatum to end support for the Taliban and support our attack on Afghanistan -- became the essence of the Bush doctrine.
Until Iraq. A year later, when the Iraq war was looming, Bush offered their major justification by enunciating a doctrine of preemptive war. This is the one Charlie Gibson thinks is the Bush doctrine.
According to Kickstarter, they are a funding platform – nothing more, nothing less. While this is true in the broadest sense, if you spend a few minutes looking through the projects you will see a slight variation in most of the pitches of the site's users. Kickstarter, according to the majority of it's project creators isn't just a funding platform, it's become the funding platform for everything from the expected to the niche.
As with anything in life though, where there is money – especially free money – there will be unintended (but perhaps not entirely unsurprising) consequences. As Kickstarter leaves the door open for just about any kind of project, knowing that the only criteria is providing a concrete ‘thing' as a result, the project rosters have become filled with a variety of people ranging from unknowns to internet celebrities, and garage start ups to companies that are already established in their field. Lately I can't help but notice that the big fish are starting to crowd out some of the smaller ones in this particular pond.
Queen Games is a German euro-game company, founded in 1992. While not one of the biggest companies, having only 7 full time employees, they are regarded as producing a great product (they won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres in both 2003 and 2012). Though perhaps hard to find in the past, their products are on the shelves of most any well stocked FLGS today. Given their size, and devoted following, they certainly qualify as “indie,” but their extensive catalog, recognizable brand, and established reputation hardly makes them underdogs in this industry.
Though Queen Games is not the only company out there that has taken to using Kickstarter less like a funding platform and more like a distribution pipeline, they are in my mind the most aggressive when it comes to using this particular niche of financial ecology (and it turns out I'm not the only one to notice.) Lets start with the facts. To date Queen Games has created 6 projects:
Of these six, all have successfully funded. Their first two projects were funded at the same time; I didn't even know this was possible. ‘Escape' started funding on March 4th and ended on April 13th, while ‘Edo' started on March 20th and ended on April 23rd. For the record, that is six projects in six months, making them the most prolific successful creative team that I have come across on Kickstarter. To date they have raised over $171,000 dollars using this model.
As I see it, this activity is best viewed in one of two ways: this new funding method is invigorating a company in tune with both it's fan's, and the needs of the crowd, or this company has found a way to fund its projects with significantly less risk, and a significantly higher margin. Lets explore both possibilities.
The Good
Crowd funding can fund whatever the crowd wants, be that Nike's latest shoe, an indie comic book, or a hot tech start up. Though I doubt they ever would, I imagine that GM could fund the development cost of a new electric car with it. These are all true statements, but I can vote with my dollars as well as the next person and I prefer to give the majority of those to creators with a real need; major players can compete for my money on the shelves of my FLGS like everyone else. Best case scenario: Queen Games is functioning as an intermediary for unknown game developers, and giving it's fan base, via Kickstarter, the cream of the crop from their backlog. On their website they say that they have over 300 promising prototypes; if this is the case, then I think they should do a couple things:
Make this clear in its video and branding , and perhaps even create a sub imprint to emphasize this fact.
, and perhaps even create a sub imprint to emphasize this fact. Start giving back to the Kickstarter community. To date Queen Games has received almost $200,000 dollars from Kickstarter, and backed only two projects. If they keep this up for another year, I'm sure other people will notice this story. There is no cheaper PR to manage this future problem than finding a couple good board games now and then, buying a copy, and leaving a glowing comment on that creators project; praise from a heavyweight like Queen would go a long way for any aficionado.

Cut your fans a break. As I deal with below – the margin on selling games through Kickstarter is significantly higher. Why sell at the same price they will be able to buy the game for after release? Reward their faith with a discount at a minimum!
I contacted Queen Games, sending them a copy of this article and asking for clarification on several points. Nikki responded, telling me that:
For us, and many publishers, Kickstarter is a way to market our games. We are beginning to publish games that are not usual for us, like Escape The Curse of the Temple, Lost Legends and an unannounced game we are also truly excited about. Kickstarter also allows us to get feedback directly from our customers prior to publishing the game. We have made changes to several components and elements before sending the games to press because of this direct feedback. We strive to make very high quality games and doing some of our more adventurous and challenging games through Kickstarter helps us to achieve this.
This statement, in of itself, doesn't address the main points I tried to raise, however, they went on to say that:
You mention one of the campaigns we ran, Ruhrschifffahrt. That actually is not our game but one from the independent publisher Spielworxx. Spielworxx games are usually very hard for folks outside of Europe to obtain, and we helped the publisher in an effort to make their excellent games more widely available. This is part of a new effort we are making to help independent publishers in Europe and North America reach larger markets. As for backing projects on Kickstarter ourselves, we generally do not back campaigns as a company, we back them as individuals. I myself have backed far too many campaigns, but haven't regretted a single one. We believe in Kickstarter's business model and feel it can be beneficial for everyone involved.
The Bad
The above quotes help soften the ideas that Queen Games is in it for the money, and has launched campaigns with an eye to help both fans and other game companies. This is great, and I hope they do more to communicate it in the future. However, I still worry that if the likes of Queen Games, Fantasy Flight and a few others decide that preselling their latest titles on Kickstarter is a good idea, then they will crowd out the actual start ups that need crowdfunding to get off the ground.
There are a couple points that I think work against some of the statements made by Queen's official representative above. Lets look at it like this: If you go to your FLGS to buy a $50 euro-game tonight, you should know that the store is making about $25. On average stores pay about half the price from the distributor. Queen Games sells the product on the other hand to the distributor and gets the better part of the remaining $25 dollars (minus the distributor's cut). On Kickstarter though, Queen has seen fit to charge its backers, presumably some its most loyal fans full price, effectively doubling their profit margin. The only ‘funded' game, Escape, currently scheduled for release is likely to MSRP for the same price that it was put up for on Kickstarter (I can't seem to find an exact number) but preorders from reputable online dealers go as low as $35. This is not rewarding your fans (or the stores that stock your products) – it's a revenue stream.
I like Queen Games. I own both Alhambra and Fresco, and have also purchased copies as presents for friends. I think they make great games, and their latest offering looks great. It tempts me terribly, but as good as it looks I don't care much for this trend. I've backed a couple projects by established companies but if they attempted to do a serial launches like this I wouldn't support them either.
So what do the rest of you think? Is this okay, or am I way off base? Will the adoption of crowdfunding by big names turn the grass roots support of Kickstarter to astroturf, or will it's collective fan base take the movement to a new level?

The welfare of animals at London zoo is being put at risk by drunken visitors at its Friday night parties, including one incident in which a man poured beer over a tiger before being thrown out by staff.
Another incident this month saw a man strip off and attempt to enter the penguin pool, forcing staff to intervene. There are also unconfirmed reports that a drunken woman tried to enter the lion enclosure in June.
Sources at the zoo have raised serious concerns about the impact on animals' sleep and stress levels from the lucrative Zoo Lates sessions, which are advertised as an “after party with the animals”.
The world's oldest zoo has been hosting sessions on Friday night for several years to attract a younger demographic, generating £800,000 a year to fund its prestigious and pioneering conservation work.
Sources told the Guardian that staff concerns about the events have been raised with management. “If an animal escaped [on a Zoo Late], it would be catastrophic,” said one person with knowledge of the zoo's workings. “During the day, welfare and conservation is of the utmost priority. In the evening, that seems to go out of the window, and the animals become a commodity. That's not what zoos are about, but there's a lot of money in it.”
London zoo confirmed the tiger and penguin incidents, but said there was no record of the story of a woman trying to enter the lion enclosure. The zoo also said that two years ago, snakes had to be moved from a glass enclosure after the glass was cracked by a group on a night out. The snakes did not escape.

A spokesperson said the zoo believed the events were safe. “We would ban alcohol if we thought it was necessary, but at the moment we see no need to do so,” they said, adding that only three people were ejected from the events during 2013 and 2014.
The evening sessions, which take place on Friday nights during the summer, with tickets costing up to £35, also feature a silent disco where visitors are given headphones to dance to without disturbing animals. However, people regularly sing loudly at the time that many species would normally be beginning to go to sleep.
On a Friday evening in July, the Guardian witnessed crowds shouting in the gorilla area beneath a sign reading, “Respect our home, be thoughtful, be quiet, be kind.” Security guards intervened only when flash photography was used.
One zookeeper at the penguin beach was asked by a man leaning over the glass barrier, “Which penguin can I fight?” while another zookeeper radioed a colleague to say a few people had been “a bit touchy-feely” with the baby penguins.
Rules intended to protect the animals appear to contribute to some of the heavy drinking. Drinks are not allowed in several of the enclosures, leading people to quickly finish pints of beer. Free wine samples are given away in the early hours of the evening, which begins at 6pm and runs until 10pm.
Many visitors come in large groups, some celebrating birthdays, hen parties and work nights out, with hundreds dressed in animal onesies. However, most visitors are not rowdy and are respectful around the enclosures.
The night culminates in a cabaret that is greeted by loud applause, whoops and shouts just metres from enclosures for apes and other primates. One zookeeper appeared to be monitoring volume levels from the cabaret, while another was overheard saying: “It's a bit loud at the white tent [cabaret venue] tonight.”

More than 6,000 people attend each Zoo Lates event, according to the zoo's marketing, and are largely composed of affluent 25-to-35-year-olds. With food and drink outlets dotted around the site, the nights are a vital source of fundraising to pay for the £28m annual running costs of the animal collections and the £5m cost of the zoo's conservation programme.
Chris Draper, programmes manager at the charity Born Free, which has analysed official British and Irish zoo inspection reports, said that the zoo should urgently re-evaulate the Zoo Lates scheme.
They said: “I am sure that London zoo's management will offer reassurances that the animals' welfare was protected and that steps were taken to minimise the impact of the events on the animals. However, it is simply not possible to actively monitor the welfare of all the animals during public events, nor to eliminate the potential for problems. In my opinion, hosting events that expose animals to additional and unnecessary stressors is unacceptable.”
The zoo's spokesperson said that animal welfare is of paramount importance, and that the small number of night-time incidents needed to be seen in context. “We think the 225,000 visitors to Zoo Lates over the past five years have generally shown the respect for animals that we expect – and the very few exceptions have been shown the door.”
One visitor to Zoo Lates in June, Samantha McConnell, who works in marketing, told the Guardian they saw a woman accidentally punching a bird in the aviary. “This girl – I don't know how drunk they are, but clearly they had been drinking for a while – they stumbled, and grabbing a branch, they inadvertently punched the side of the bird, and the bird took off, and they said, ‘Oh, sorry.' I could not believe it.”
They added: “I saw animals being taunted, and people banging on the glass. One guy was rubbing themselves on the glass at the snake enclosure. In the butterfly exhibit, people were so careless, crushing butterflies on the ground. I don't think partying, alcohol and animals are a good combination.”
Juveria Siddiqui, a trainee surgeon, told the Guardian of their visit last year: “There were a lot of drunk people. I never saw anybody do anything too terrible like climb into an enclosure, but people were tapping on the gorilla enclosure window and taking photos with a flash, and I got the feeling the gorilla wasn't happy about that. I saw a few people shouting around animals, but not at them.”

Online reviews and social media users have raised some concerns. One student tweeted: “Loads of drunk people roaming the zoo. Not sure if its too fair on the animals tho, gorillas were throwing poo,” while Dr James Logan, a Channel 4 presenter and scientist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, wrote: “Great fundraising idea, but wasnt keen on drunk people staring thro glass at animals.”
A reviewer on TripAdvisor wrote last year: “I was surprised to discover that people were getting intoxicated and being loud. I am not a boring guy, I like to have a laugh like the rest of us, but I do not think that getting drunk in a zoo is a good idea. I mean, how does it affect the animals?”
A user signing themselves as the manager of support services at the zoo wrote back: “it is indeed a shame that some of our visitors choose an evening at the zoo for their drinking, and I can assure you that it is definitely not in the spirit of Zoo Lates, and on the whole we find the majority of the visitors are respectful and well behaved.”
They added: “Our keepers also closely monitor animal's [sic] behaviour during the event and we can assure that we have not seen any negative effects on them in the past 3 years.”

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Google Inc's Chrome web browser overtook Microsoft Corp's Internet Explorer (IE) to become market leader globally for the first time last Sunday, web analytics firm StatCounter said on Wednesday.
“While it is only one day, this is a milestone,” said Aodhan Cullen, StatCounter's chief executive.
“At weekends, when people are free to choose what browser to use, many of them are selecting Chrome in preference to IE.”
On March 18, Chrome was used for 32.7 percent of all browsing, while Explorer had 32.5 percent share. When people returned to their offices on Monday, the IE share rose to 35 percent and Chrome's share slipped to 30 percent.
“Whether Chrome can take the lead in the browser wars in the long term remains to be seen, however the trend towards Chrome usage at weekends is undeniable,” Cullen said.
On a monthly basis, Chrome's market share has surged to 31 percent so far in March from 17 percent a year ago, while Explorer has slipped to 35 percent from 45 percent a year earlier.
The market share of Firefox — which is popular in Europe — is globally around 25 percent.
Apple Inc's Safari is a distant number four with a 7 percent share of all browsing, with Opera at number five on 2 percent.
StatCounter statistics are based on aggregate data from more than 3 million websites with a sample of more than 15 billion page views per month.

The rock is reality. The squishy place is the illusion that pervasive racketeering is an okay replacement for an economy. The essence of racketeering is the use of dishonest schemes to get money, often (but not always) employing coercion to make it work. Some rackets can function on the sheer cluelessness of the victim(s).
Is it fair to suppose that money management is at the heart of the sort of advanced, complex economy that developed early in the 20th century? I think so. Money is the lifeblood of trade and of investment in productive activities that support trade. Of course, in order for money to have meaning, to function in such transactional relations, the people must be convinced that it legitimately represents its face value. Otherwise, money must be labeled “money” — that is, a medium of exchange suspected of false value. An economy that uses “money” — especially an economy of rackets — is an economy in a lot of trouble, and that is where ours is in December 2013.
The trouble reached escape velocity in the fall of 2008 when a particular brand of racket among the Wall Street kit-bag of rackets got badly out-of-hand, namely the business of selling securitized bundled mortgages and their “innovative” derivative “products” to dupes unaware that they were booby-trapped for failure which would, perversely, hugely reward the seller of such trash paper. These were, in the immortal words of Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich), the “really shitty deal[s]” propagated by the likes of the Goldman Sachs crypto-bank — so-called collateralized debt obligations — pawned off on credulous pension fund managers and other “marks” around the world greedy for “yield.”
It turned out that all the large banks trafficking in such booby-trapped contracts ended up choking on them when “the music stopped” — that is, when the derivative “swaps” payoffs at the heart of this particular racket began to fail, sending up a general alarm that all such “products” were primed to blow up the entire “banking” system. By the way, the quotation marks I so liberally resort to are necessary to denote that in such a matrix of rackets things are not what they appear to be but only what they pretend to be.
The failure of Bear Stearns followed by the implosion of Lehman Brothers and the near-death experience of AIG alerted “civilians” outside Wall Street that the banks were linked in a web of fraud and insolvency and had to be “rescued” in order for the rest of America to keep its “way of life” going. The rescue remedy proved to be several new layers of fraud that have now matured into institutionalized rackets. The best known are the Siamese twins of “Quantitative Easing” and zero interest rate policy (ZIRP). The lesser-known racket was the 2009 rule change by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that allowed banks to make up whatever numbers they felt like in reporting the value of their holdings (“assets”).
Hence, these dishonest, regularized operations can be labeled a hostage racket with coercion at their core. The coercion comes in the form of the threat that any let-up in the stream of QE “money” enjoyed by the banks in the form of carry-trade “loans” and “primary dealer” premium cream-offs will send the economy back to the stone age. Overlooked in this equation is the ongoing destruction of ordinary citizens (a.k.a. the “middle class”) who have already lost their grip on the emblematic “way of life” Wall Street is working so tirelessly to defend. Politicians are, of course, deeply implicated and indeed directly involved in all these rackets, since these hired handmaidens make and execute the laws protecting Wall Street's looting operations.
The catch to all this, lately, lies in the cognitive dissonance between the symptomatic euphoria of record stock market indexes versus the conviction of a few hardcore skeptical observers that the rackets are now so reckless and impudent as to be beyond any hope of control and on a trajectory to bring about hardships orders of magnitude above anything imagined in 2008.
So-called “health care” is also a hostage racket, since sick people are hardly in a position to bargain for anything, but it is only a sub-system of the larger matrix of rackets that have made this such an unusually dishonest society. My guess is that ObamaCare is sure to make it worse, and pretty quickly too, since the rules for ObamaCare were written by the hireling lobbyists of the industries that benefit from the racketeering.
The big mystery in all this remains: where are the people with some institutional power who might stand up and denounce all this perfidy? What has made us such a culture of cowards and cravens that the best we can do is produce a couple of comedians who speak truth to power in the form of jokes. Most of this is not that funny.
By the way, one reason for the vulgar orgy of “consumerism” that, in recent years, has turned the Thanksgiving holiday into a sort of grotesque sporting event, is to mount a crude demonstration that our “money” is a viable medium of exchange. The dumbest people in the land are induced to swarm through the merchandise warehouse stores and fight to exchange their “money” for hard goods offered at false “bargains.” I wonder how much of it is a dress rehearsal for what happens in a hyper-inflation?

A bad year for nuclear power producers has Belgians and Britons shivering more vigorously as summer heat fades into fall. Multiple reactor shutdowns in both countries have heightened concern about the security of power supplies when demand spikes this winter.
In Belgium, rolling blackouts are already part of this winter's forecast because three of the country's largest reactors—reactors that normally provide one-quarter of Belgian electricity—are shut down.
Belgium's troubles started brewing two years ago during inspections at the country's seven nuclear reactors, all operated by Belgian utility Electrabel. Ultrasound inspection of the reactor pressure vessels at the utility's Doel power station near Antwerp revealed previously unrecognized defects at its 1,000-megawatt reactor #3.
Prior tests looked only for aging of the welds between a pressure vessels' steel plates, but this time broader inspections at Doel 3 detected thousands of tiny cracks in the plates themselves. The cracks were most likely created when the plates were originally forged. In response, Electrabel shut down the 1,000-MW reactor #2 at its Tihange power station in eastern Belgium, because its pressure vessel was forged by the same Dutch shipyard as Doel 3's. Once it was shutdown, the company found similar microcracks.
Despite all of the attention paid to terrorist threats, insider threats remain the most serious challenge confronting nuclear facilities
The cracks reduce the vessels' capacity to withstand spiking pressures and temperatures during an accident. Belgium's Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC) decided that the resulting risk was acceptable and cleared the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 reactors to restart in the summer of 2013. But in March 2014 Electrabel shut them down again following tests at Belgium's national research lab in Mol. Researchers there irradiated steel with comparable microcracks and observed a greater-than-anticipated reduction in the steel's strength.
It was the shutdown of a third 1,000-MW reactor that threw Belgium into a tizzy this August. This time it was reactor #4 at Doel, where leaking lubricant damaged the plant's steam turbine. A spokesperson for Electrabel revealed that the leak resulted from "an apparently deliberate manual intervention” of the turbine's oil drain, according to a Flanders Today report.
Prosecutors and anti-terrorism agents swooped in to investigate the alleged sabotage, while Belgium's government and power distributors began crafting plans for rolling blackouts this winter. The blackout plans, released in broad form early this month and at the street-by-street level last Friday, lay out how distributors can ration power supplies.
Response to the plans has been explosive
Response to the plans has been explosive. Belgian media reports are replete with recriminations by elected officials questioning the fairness of the plans. Those representing small communities are irked that big cities are to be largely spared, and some Belgians perceive national favoritism at work. Last week leading Flemish politician Koenraad Degroote accused Secretary of State for Energy Catherine Fonck, a francophone, of going easy on Belgium's French-speaking communities.
Seen through the lens of energy policy, Belgium's troubles are a classic example of the "brittleness" of large electrical systems —a concept developed by systems analysts Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins in Brittle Power, their classic 1982 treatise on energy security. The Lovins' central point is that reliance on a small number of large power stations means that just a few failures—deliberate or otherwise—can have a devastating impact on power supplies.
Sabotage of the sort that may have sidelined Electrabel's Doel 4 reactor was a key part of the Lovins' analysis. Despite all of the attention paid to terrorist threats, insider threats remain the "most serious challenge confronting nuclear facilities" according to political scientists Scott Sagan at Stanford University and Matthew Bunn of Harvard. They made that case in an April 2014 article in the Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
The U.K., meanwhile, is experiencing the same sort of "series defect" that started Belgium's troubles. In August EDF Energy, the U.K. subsidiary of Paris-based EDF, found a crack in a boiler during a routine inspection at a nuclear power plant near Lancaster. EDF immediately shut down three more reactors of the same design. With four reactors suddenly out of service, U.K. grid operator National Grid this month began seeking emergency power supplies for the winter.
Belgium's microcrack discovery could have had a far greater impact. The discovery sent reactor operators and regulators in several countries scrambling to see if their own vessels forged at the same Dutch shipyard—including 10 reactors examined in the United States—harbored hidden flaws. To date no microcracks have been found in reactors outside of Belgium.
But as one Belgian nuclear policy specialist has noted, none of the other reactors have been examined using the wider ultrasound testing performed in Belgium. And the hunt for trouble is widening. At least one regulator, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, has ordered ultrasound testing of all vessels forged from steel rings, regardless of their source.
As for Doel 3 and Tihange 2, they remain closed until further testing and analysis by Electrabel can prove they are safe to restart. This will, according to FANC, include a review of Electrabel's "safety case" by foreign experts.
The overall result of the black-out campaign could be a 10-year life extension of the three oldest plants
All this talk of risk and vulnerability might make some people think twice about being dependent on nuclear energy. Ironically, in Belgium, it might have just the opposite effect according to Aviel Verbruggen, an economist and energy policy expert at the University of Antwerp.
Officially Belgium is approaching the first deadline for a nuclear phaseout legislated by Belgium's parliament in 2003, which would require the shutdown of the three oldest nuclear reactors in 2015 and the remaining four by 2025. But Verbruggen says there has been no coordinated policymaking to create alternative supplies, while the reactors' French owners—EDF and Electrabel parent company GDF Suez—have been preparing Belgium's reactors for continued operation.
Verbruggen says the present fear of power shortages may translate into public support for overriding the nuclear phaseout: "Because the strategic behavior of Suez and EDF is strong, and the Belgian political system is weak, the overall result of the black-out campaign could be a 10-year life extension of the three oldest plants. The majority of people will accept the life extension because they place supply reliability at the top of their preferences."
It seems as though Spider-Man is going to be playing a key role in the upcoming “Original Sin” event, from writer Jason Aaron and artist Mike Deodato. The series is about the investigation into the murder of Uatu, also known as the Watcher, whose all-seeing eyes held with them the secrets to the universe. It seems that the eyes have survived Uatu's death and the inhabitants of the Marvel universe can use their powers to unearth all the dirty little secrets that the world and its followers have never seen before.
Comic Book Resources held a press conference call with Jason Aaron, Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso, and Senior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort to discuss the series (read it here). The panelist reveled an interesting piece of information on how Spider-Man factors into the series that could have huge ramifications on Spider-Man's life.
They revealed that “In Spider-Man's world, we'll learn that there was someone else that was bitten by the radioactive spider that originally bit Peter Parker. Fallout from this revelation will begin being dealt with in Dan Slott's new Amazing Spider-Man #1. “‘It's a character that cuts back to the very first day in the science lab,' said Brevoort.”
Someone else was bitten by a radioactive spider? Why not? We've already questioned whether the spider had magic powers during J. Michael Staczynski's run. Over at Bleeding Cool they have a few other speculative ideas (read it here).
Their theorizing basically suspects that this other character is none other than the 616 Universe's Miles Morales that was teased at the end of Spider-Men #5. The idea is that the CBR article asserts that there will be ramifications of “Original Sin” in Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 3) #1 and to solicit for Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 3) #2 suggests that in a strong way:
AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #2
DAN SLOTT (W) • HUMBERTO RAMOS (A/C)
Variant cover by Mike Deodato
• Electro's power is out of control! And only one person can fix it…
• …the Superior Spider-Man!
• Wait. This book's the AMAZING Spider-Man now.
• So we're probably out of luck.
• Plus: That thing that freaked you out last issue? There's more on that. The return of you-know-who? There's MUCH more on that. Action! Drama! Surprises! There's MORE OF EVERYTHING!
What is “that thing that freaked you out last issue?” Slott has said that the villain that is introduced in Amazing Spider-Man #1.1, the new title that we announced from Dan Slott that is better known as “Year One: Learning to Crawl,” would:
Slott: Readers will meet an all-new villain, but unlike other stories like this where the new villain is planned as this giant, earth-shattering force like Mr. Sinister who's the secret villain behind everything, in this case it's not. This is actually going down a trickier path, to try to create a villain who will feel like a Spider-Man villain of old. It'll feel like you could have read about this guy at the same time you saw the first appearances of Mysterio, Electro or Sandman. But while we're aiming for that zone, this villain will have an interesting twist that makes them have much more in common with Peter than the others.
When you look at all of Spider-Man's earliest villains, they're all adults. Peter is 15 years old, dressing up as a superhero, and fighting full-grown, mature adults – some guys even as old as the Vulture. What you'll see with this new villain is Peter fighting someone their own age for the first time. With all the high school drama they go through during the day, this brings all those problems they have in the school yard and puts it on the super villain.
Could it be that Peter Parker and Miles Morales of the 616 universe are around the same age and were both bitten by the spider back in Amazing Fantasy #15? Is this why Peter looked so shocked when they discovered who Miles Morales was at the end of Spider-Men #5? Did they recognize the face they saw from when they were a high schooler?
It all seems plausible and also like a bit of a stretch. Perhaps the solicits assertions about a thing that “freaked you out last issue” could refer to something altogether different… Perhaps it was even referring to what may have been spoiled in this article at Marvel.com.
In a new teaser by Steve McNiven and Mike McKone, readers can see Spider-Man holding the Watcher's all-seeing eye. The article from Marvel asserts:
“Does Otto Octavius have enough of a hold on Spider-Man that they could have committed the deadly deed?”
I don't know about you, but it seems to me that Peter's return might not be as clean as we all suspected. Will Peter be sharing a body with Doctor Octopus or has their recent trip through Otto's mind left a lingering fragment in their mind? Does this mean we will be getting blue-ghost Doctor Octopus? It seems that even though Superior Spider-Man is ending, the battle for the control of Peter Parker's body is far from over.
What do you think of all of this speculation? Do you have a theory of your own?
Israel may say that it wants peace, but the reality has become clear. Once U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry left the region, Israel felt protected by the charm handed to it for free by Obama and subsequently ignored their advice on how to work on ending the occupation.
If you are generous to a decent person, you own him, and if you are kind to a nasty person, they rebel, goes a famous Arab saying.
What we are witnessing now is Israel's rebellion against its generous benefactor: the U.S.
Here are a few examples. Before Obama came to Israel, there was discussion about some confidence-building measures. Palestinians were asked to refrain from taking Israel to the International Court of Justice while Israel was asked to freeze settlement activities in order to facilitate a return to peace talks.
The Palestinians complied; Israelis did not.
Israeli refusal to cooperate
Another idea was that Israel should refrain from making any settlement announcements and agree to release Palestinians imprisoned before the 1993 Oslo Accords. When then-Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat famously shook hands, the Palestinians were led to believe that their prisoners would be released.
The leaders of those prisoners (Arafat and Abbas and others) were allowed back into Palestine, but the foot soldiers are rotting in jail. Now, 20 years later, the Israelis are still dragging their feet about a promise Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres made and which they have the power, as president, to execute.
Not only were these prisoners not released, their condition worsened. Prison visits are often barred or delayed for years, and medical services are denied or curtailed, to the point that a cancer patient is literally given aspirin.
There is a case to be made about medical neglect and, again, sheer nastiness. Sixty-five-year-old Maysara Abu Humaida, in jail for nearly 20 years, was coughing severely last September; they were diagnosed with an advance-stage throat cancer. They were taken to a hospital clinic for a check-up but not for treatment. Six months after their diagnosis, they died with their feet shackled to the hospital bed.
The least that should have been done was allowing them to get proper medical treatment or, alternatively, they should have been released. Palestinian officials say they were expecting Israel to release him, but again, since Israel could not get anything in return, they were left to die in jail.
Israelis insist on dealing with issues only when face-to-face negotiations begin. Netanyahu insists that their government (made up of pro-settler parties) will not freeze settlement activities beforehand.
Talks on borders and security
The Obama-Kerry team also suggested that, instead of being stuck on the issue of a settlement freeze, talks should begin on borders and security. This seemed logical considering Israelis and Palestinians had agreed to this exact formula during Obama's first term.
The wisdom behind this idea is that it deals with what Israelis need, security, and with what Palestinians want, border demarcation. Again, the Israelis refused.
An unnamed Israeli source told the Israeli daily Haaretz that dealing with these issues gives Palestinians what they want and gives nothing to Israel. This is strange. Land for peace has always been the basis for peace talks, and one wonders how Israel fails to consider reaching security arrangements in its favor.
The Israeli arrogance is based on the feeling that the relative quiet in the West Bank will last forever. But already there are signs that it will not last long.
Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike are demanding that they be either tried or released and this has captured the imagination of the Palestinian public.
The case of Samer Issawi
Samer Issawi, who has been refusing to take in any solid food for six months, is protesting their detention without charge or trial. Instead of releasing him, the Israelis are trying to get rid of them by suggesting they voluntarily agree to move permanently to Gaza. In response to European countries' protests about their continued detention, the Israeli government replied by suggesting that a European country accept to take him.
If Issawi is such a security threat, why would Israel agree to allow them to live in Gaza or send them to live in an allied European country? It is only logical that Israel should release them or, if it does have serious accusations against him, try him.
Israeli officials are totally oblivious to the fact that over three million Palestinians are still living under their brutal military control. Travel restrictions continue; local churches say that 60 percent of Palestinian Christians were denied permits to visit Jerusalem on Easter holy week.
Gaza remains under an illegal siege and the only port of movement for West Bankers, the King Hussein Bridge, is at times operating at a snail's pace.
Attempts to build a Palestinian airport near Jericho continue to be thwarted without any logical reason given and there is no chance that the Gaza international airport (opened by Bill Clinton) will operate soon.
It is clear that by being generous to a nasty person, that person has rebelled. The Obama charm offensive has clearly backfired; it is being totally abused and misunderstood as a sign of American weakness.

Most of the hops used to create the beers at Big Grove Brewery are trucked halfway across the country before arriving in Solon.
This fall, however, the key ingredient in the brewery's annual harvest beer will be picked only a few miles away.
Buck Creek Hops, the newest and largest hops farm in Iowa, has begun harvesting its first large-scale commercial crop just outside Solon after planting 25,000 plants on 25 acres this spring.
Though its initial harvest will be small one — the vine-growing plants take a few years to reach full maturity — Buck Creek has begun supplying its hops to craft breweries around the region, including Big Grove.
"A lot of people don't think about the supply chain for their beer or their wine or their food," said Bill Heinrich, the head brewer at Big Grove. "But having Buck Creek close really does give people a good sense of what it takes as a brewer to get beer to people. They can see the amount of work they're putting in, and they can see the amount of work the brewery is putting in."

Buck Creek owner Mark Pattison and their four partners have transformed much of their farmland at 2434 Turner Ave., midway between Iowa City and Solon, into a hop yard they say is among the largest in the Midwest. After growing a test crop last year, the partners erected 1,600 poles, each 22 feet tall, creating a wide network of trellises for the hops vines to climb.
The partners also built a large harvesting building this summer — a 120-foot by 60-foot facility housing a stationary harvest machine, much like a thresher, that was shipped from Germany. Buck Creek's operation will have the capability to process hops cones into pellets, which is the form of the ingredient many breweries like Big Grove use in their brewing.
All told, Pattison expects to harvest about 1,000 pounds of hops this year, though that is just a fraction of what they hope to grow in the coming seasons. They've planted seven varieties, with four currently available: Chinook, Cascade, Nugget and Columbus.
"It's our first year and a small crop," Pattison said. "We'll be more at full production next year and the year after. It takes a hop plant three years to mature. The first year is mainly just getting the roots started, and you hope to get some crop."
Buck Creek has invited brewers to handpick their own hops this year, which Pattison said is beneficial for those creating batches of "wet hops" beer — using the cones straight off the vine before they're processed and dried.

At Big Grove, Heinrich and their crew typically use hops from the Pacific Northwest — where the vast majority of the nation's hops originate — in their core portfolio beers, but partner with local growers in the fall for their harvest beers. This year, Big Grove is exclusively using fresh-picked hops from Buck Creek. As Pattison's operation continues to grow, Heinrich said their brewery hopes to partner with them to create a year-round beer featuring Iowa hops.
With hops prices soaring in recent years amid a craft brewing boom, Heinrich said many have tried to cash in by growing hops commercially. What could set Buck Creek apart in the long run, though, is the up-front investment Pattison and their partners are putting in to establish a larger operation with automated equipment.
"The more I watch them do it, and the more we start to work with them, I think they have a better feel for what it's going to take to make a successful long-term project instead of just a short-term windfall.," Heinrich said. "I'm really hoping they do well; I think he's going to be a good partner moving forward.
"Having a local supplier on the hops side I think is the next step of what we want to do as an industry in Iowa."
Teresa Albert, owner of Millstream Brewing Co. in Amana, said their brewery plans to handpick hops at Buck Creek this fall to use in its Iowa Pale Ale. Albert said while some flavoring ingredients for beer can be found locally for Iowa brewers, the core ingredients — including hops, malt and yeast — are largely outsourced.
"We are really excited about the potential revival of hops growing in Iowa," Albert said.

President Donald Trump's feud with a member of their own party erupted Tuesday, as the president delivered blow after blow on Twitter to Sen. Bob Corker, while the outgoing senator again warned about Trump's fitness to serve only hours before they both attended a Senate GOP policy lunch.
In tweets Tuesday, Trump contended the Tennessee Republican is "fighting" tax cuts and "couldn't get elected dog catcher." The president again claimed that Corker chose not to run for re-election when Trump "refused" to endorse them and said they "now is only negative on anything Trump."
Responding later in a CNN interview, Corker rebutted Trump and again took the remarkable step of questioning the president's fitness for office. The senator said "nothing" that Trump wrote in their tweets was truthful. They added that the president "debases our country" and will not "rise to the occasion as president."
Corker said they would not support Trump again and contended that the president has "great difficulty with the truth," part of an escalating feud that complicates the GOP's push to overhaul the American tax system.
The golfer was arrested after a video of them striking the goose went viral (Picture:: LiveLeak)
The golfer who killed a goose by decapitating it with a club while they were filmed by a friend has stepped forward to give their version of the story.
The unnamed golfer, who is currently under police investigation after being arrested on Friday night, told Finnish website Ilta-Sanomat they had killed the goose after it became injured by one of their drives.
They said a ball had hit the animal on the head and left it convulsing in pain with blood visible from its mouth and nostrils.
The golfer said they then decided to strike the bird on the back of its head to end its suffering. They told the website that they were unaware that swinging their golf club at the animal's head would decapitate it.
The incident is thought to have taken place at 8pm on Monday at Vantaa Golf Club near Helsinki. The man was not a member but has been since been banned from returning to the course.

The golfer is reported to have contacted officers after the video went viral and is helping them with their investigations. Metro.co.uk has contacted Finnish police for an update.

Vantaa managing director Ville Nurmi, who made the criminal report after condemning the content, said they were not able to verify the claims of the golfer that the club was closed at the time.
They told metro.co.uk that even if the club was closed there were other options available to the golfer. They said they would always advise members in similar situations to act according to the law.
‘If there is an injured animal I think the correct way to do something is to contact the police or animal authority and find out what you should do about it,' they said.
An RSPCA spokesperson said: ‘We are shocked to see reports that a golfer in Finland killed a goose in such a horrific way. This is completely unacceptable, and would have caused the bird unthinkable suffering.
‘Anyone who finds an injured animal should call the relevant animal welfare specialists as a matter of urgency, whether that be a vet, or a welfare organisation like the RSPCA here in England and Wales.'

“They said ‘We're going to tase her, we're going to taser it,' and the group was pleading with them. Everyone was kinda yelling, ‘Please don't taser the cow, it's only going to make it worse,” they told WBZ NewsRadio 1030.
Houdini was zapped at least four times.
WBZ-TV's Jim Smith reports
“It didn't really affect the cow all that much. It kind of realized that something had hit it and that it was comparable to a bee sting.”
However, Bordeleau thought police went too far.

Sgt. Mike Pickles told WBZ they made the right decision.
“It blew through a wooden fence right next to me. That was the time a decision was made. I have to do something to try and control this animal,” they said.
“As a matter of public safety, that is a better option than just allowing things to happen and people get hurt.”
The cow made it home safely and, at last check, was eating grass.

Earlier this week, I got talking with an historian who teaches the history of modern India here in London. I had run into an impasse with a piece of research—on the history of timekeeping in India—and I was eager to think aloud with someone who had decades of experience dealing with clueless students.
After listening to me patiently, the good professor suggested a few new perspectives to approach the problem from, and a couple of books that I may find useful, including, interestingly, Joseph Conrad's novel The Secret Agent (a novel in which a terrorist plots to destroy the observatory at Greenwich, that of GMT fame).
Once we got that out of the way, we sat down and had a chat about India and Brexit and history and all kinds of other things. Say what you want about the internet. There is nothing like sitting down with someone who knows a lot of stuff and just talking. I highly recommend it.
“You know what is frustrating?" they said at one point. “After all these years, nobody has written a good, scholarly history of the Emergency." While sociologists have done some work on public perceptions of the Emergency, they said, a big, hairy, audacious history of this turbulent and transformative period in Indian history remains a glaring gap in popular Indian historiography.
Frequent readers may recall that this lacuna has been raised in these pages before. The Emergency is just one of several periods of modern Indian history that remains underserved in our book stores. The market liberalization of 1991 and the Kargil War are other examples. All events that could easily make for numerous works from numerous perspectives. Works that are essential if one is to make any sense of India in the past, present or future.
A few days after this conversation, I was passing by the British Library when I decided to pop in for a look. What did these guys have on the Emergency, I wondered. And that is how I stumbled upon numerous examples of that fascinating genre: the literature of Sanjay Gandhi sycophancy. I was able to locate three Indian books published during the Emergency.
Dear readers, I have seldom taken greater pleasure in gathering material for this column.
S. Jagat Singh's Sanjay Gandhi And Awakening Of Youth Power, published in 1977, starts with these immortal lines: “The entire world is amazed at the spectacular progress made by India in all important areas after the declaration of state of emergency on 25th June 1975. Within the short period, Indian prestige has grown hundredfold in the eyes of foreign countries whether friends or foes. Even those who obnoxiously criticized India on every pretext, have come to realize the importance of this crucial step taken by the Indian Government."
Jagat Singh, who the title page tells us is the “Winner of International Literary Awards", goes on to say: “Who will willingly submit to sterilization? Who will like to marry their son without a dowry? Who will waste their working time on keeping their house and their environment neat and clean? The greatness of Shri Sanjay Gandhi lies in the fact that they took up very unpopular programmes and vested them with a roaring popularity by dint of hard work and the force of their personality."
M.J. Rao's Youth Resurgence was published in late 1976 by Progressive Writers and Publishers, a company that may have been owned by senior Congress party members (later, V.C. Shukla was linked with the PWP and an associated newspaper, The Hitavada).
“The country had to be saved from subversive elements," Rao writes. “The proclamation of Emergency thus marked a decisive phase in the country's history and the beginning of new era of discipline and hard work." And that, of course, is where Sanjay Gandhi comes in. A man who, Rao says with complete lack of irony, came up life the hard way, first through schooling in Dehradun and then through an apprenticeship in Rolls-Royce. Sanjay is the future: “History has still in its womb the future of this illustrious son of the Nehru family, but the omens are all to the good."
No such restraint in our third book. Supreme Court advocate Piare Lal Sharma's 1977 book is titled World's Wisest Wizard—A Psychography Of Sanjay Gandhi's Cosmic Mind. This was Sharma's follow-up to a biography of Indira Gandhi titled World's Greatest Woman.
Sharma was no ordinary sycophant.
Sharma starts off by telling us in their author's note that, “Writing is a natural gift to me and this book is a National Gift to you." Then after an opening chapter that calls Sanjay Gandhi an “embodiment of arts and sciences", we move on to a truly spectacular second chapter that imagines a conversation between Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi one night in March 1946. At one point, Feroze thinks to themselves about their wife: “How typically they represent their class: My mind is a volcano. Them mind is an unfathomable ocean."
Sharma's masterpiece goes on for another 400 pages or so.
I highly recommend it. Not just because it is utterly bonkers. But also because it tells us how easy it is for governments to convince ostensibly intelligent people to grovel at their feet. Because it tells us how easily shrewd governments can manufacture news and opinion. Sure, the books I picked out at the British Library represent the most outlandish end of the sycophancy spectrum. But let us keep in mind that all over India many other journalists found other less obviously sycophantic ways of perpetuating propaganda. It has happened before. And it could well happen again.

(CNN) -- Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the former business partners and Harvard University classmates of Mark Zuckerberg, have dropped their court appeal of a settlement with the Facebook founder.
The Winklevosses had claimed they were shortchanged in a $65 million settlement with Zuckerberg because Facebook had misrepresented the value of company stock. In April, a federal appeals judge rejected the argument and ruled the twins could not unwind the legally binding agreement they had signed in 2008.
The brothers and a third partner, Divya Narendra, had wanted to reverse that ruling and were willing to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. But in documents filed Wednesday with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, they said they will not pursue the matter any longer.
"We've considered this case closed for a long time, and we're pleased to see the other party now agrees," Facebook spokesperson Andrew Noyes said in a statement.
Facebook's long-running battle with the Winklevoss brothers was a key plot point in "The Social Network," a 2010 fictionalized movie dramatization of the company's origins.
In late 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra asked Zuckerberg to help them write the coding for a social networking site they were developing for Harvard and other campuses. Zuckerberg entered into an oral agreement and was made a partner.
In February 2004, however, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, which they later renamed Facebook. The Winklevosses and Narendra filed suit later that year against Facebook and Zuckerberg. The trio alleged that Zuckerberg had stolen the idea for Facebook from them.
Facebook promptly countersued the trio and their own social networking site, ConnectU, alleging they had hacked into Facebook to steal data and spam users.
A California court ordered the parties to mediate the dispute, and according to court records, they signed an agreement in which the Winklevosses would give up ConnectU for cash and a share in Facebook stock.
The Winklevosses and Narendra later tried to pull out of the deal, alleging that Facebook had undervalued its stock, thus rendering the agreement as having been procured fraudulently.
A judge ruled against them and forced the settlement to go through, but the Winklevosses and Narendra appealed
In April, U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, ruled against them.
"At some point, litigation must come to an end," Kozinski concluded. "That point has now been reached."

Sharing photographers that I met at the SW Regional SPE Conference hosted by the Center of Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins, Colorado….
Carol S. Dass has created a project, Mother, where they look at the significant female figure in their life with a new perspective–not as the woman who raised her, but as a human being with their own history and dreams. As children (and even as adults) it is difficult to see our parents outside of our familial arena, but then again, it works both ways–as parents, our children will always be our children–people to be watched over and concerned about.
Carol was born in Oakland, California, raised in rural Missouri and they received their BA in Art from Northwest Missouri State University. They have lived in Colorado Springs for 30 years and has been an instructor of photography at the University of Colorado – Colorado Springs for the past 12 years. Carol's work has been shown nationally and is in the collections of the Denver Art Museum, the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and numerous private collections.
MOTHER
Typed out in bold that word seems foreign to me. Partly because I have never been or will ever be a mother. As I move through this life, thinking about aging and one's place in the world a lot of time has recently been spent with my mother. They have been alone for several years, and I have been seeing them with new eyes while listening to their history. It's funny how growing up we tend to view our mother's as just that “Mother”, unable to see beyond that role of the woman who carried me in their womb, raised me the best that they could, and will in many ways continue to view me as a child regardless of my age.
My mother was forced to work to support us, went back to night school while working and taking care of nearby relatives. They were not at home to greet me with a plate of warm cookies when I came home from school asking after my day. I remember when I was an adult coming into my own finally seeing my mother as a “person”, a unique individual who had many adventures and stories to tell.
The reasons behind perceived and real dysfunction became easier to understand. These images are a small documentation of “mother”, a reflection of what has occurred and what is ahead.
A new report released Monday has given Norwegians something to celebrate - if they weren't smiling already. The Scandinavian country vaulted three spots to claim the title of world's happiest country according to the latest world Happiness Report released on Monday.
Norway ousted Denmark, which landed in this year's second spot, followed by Iceland and Switzerland.
The top four countries scored high on factors that the report says are key to happiness including: "caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance," the report said.
"What works in the Nordic countries is a sense of community and understanding of the common good," Meik Wiking, chief executive officer of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen told the Associated Press. Wiking was not part of Monday's global scientific study.
The report's lead author, John Helliwell, noted that they found it takes more than money to make people feel happy.
"It's the human things that matter. If the riches make it harder to have frequent and trustworthy relationship between people, is it worth it?" said Helliwell, who is also an economist at the University of British Columbia in Canada.
"The material can stand in the way of the human."

Poverty, conflict-hit countries at bottom
Although a sense of community can help people, some amount of money and security are necessary to feel happy. Most of the countries at the bottom of the list are in desperate poverty.
Central African Republic fell to last on the happiness list, joined by Burundi, Tanzania, Syria and Rwanda.
Yemen, a country hit hard by civil war and with millions risking starvation, was also ranked in the bottom ten.
Red, white and feeling blue
Germany stayed in the same spot as last year - coming in 16th on the list under Ireland but above Belgium.
The latest report shows, however, that people in Germany are steadily rating themselves as happier compared to previous years.
The United States, on the other hand, was 14th on the list ranking, falling down one spot from last year. The report also found that America's happiness score dropped 5 percent over the past decade as people are rating themselves as well happy.
Nicaragua and Latvia's happiness scores increased the most.
The report, which was released to coincide with World Happiness Day, ranks 155 countries. The list has been used by the United Nations since 2012 when Bhutan secured support for a proposal to recognize happiness as a guiding principle for public policies.

The widespread deployment of MEMS in smart phones has ancillary benefits that I thought worth looking into. One of these was breathing new life into 8-bit processors. I began my search by calling Hal Barbour. He's the CEO of CAST, Inc. a company that has made a business offering a range of popular and standards-based IP cores including the venerable 8051. Their COO, Nikos Zervas, joined the call as well.
The question I had for the two of them was the roll that the 8051 had in the development of the smart sensors going into smart phones, automobiles and Internet of Things. I picked the 8051 because of my past association with the processor while at my old company ARC International. One of the growing markets for ARC was in 8051 replacements and one of the company's successes was displacing the 8051 in USB drive controllers.
The old saying that as one door closes another one opens appeared to be working for the 8051. As the CPU was designed out of the USB applications it began being integrated with smart sensors in a multichip package. The automotive tire pressure sensor was an example. Mandated by law to be included on new vehicles, all car models produced after September 2007 came with the tire pressure sensor. Many of the sensors came with the 8051, for example the Texas Instruments TPIC82000 Series. The electric utility power meter was another application adopting the 8051.
Hal pointed out that many of the sensor designs that began adopting the 8051 were being fabricated in the older processes, 130nm and larger. At these process nodes, gate count matters and the relative small size of the 8051 is a desired feature.
The continuing attraction to this simple 8-bit processor is borne out by market research data. The last market research on 8-bit processors I was able to find was published 2008 and it showed the 8051 with a declining 19 percent of the embedded processor market, still the largest share of all the 8-bit processors featured in the report. A recent IC Insights research bulletin published August 13 showed embedded processor in general growing; accounting for 11 percent of MPU sales in 2013 (versus 9 percent previously).
Hal and Nikos had a laundry list of reasons why the 8051 has remained popular since its formal introduction in 1980 beginning with cost. Unlike 32-bit processors that come with a license fee and royalty stream, the 8051 can be had for one upfront charge. And like the popular 32-bit architectures, the 8051 has a wide and deep ecosystem of software, programmer familiarity, and design expertise that make it and ideal solution for a wide range of embedded computing tasks.
Next, the two cited the fact that most of the engineers building sensors are analog and mixed signal designers. Their designs need more than a state machine to control analog mixed signal circuits and the 8051 fits the bill. The 8-bit microcontroller core also comes with the interfaces—Philips' I2C, Motorola's SPI, Bosch's CAN buses—to connect analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters as well as other peripherals. To support remote sensors, the 8051 comes with circuits and stacks for wireless communications protocols: Zigbee, WiFi, BlueTooth, as well as Ethernet.
I asked Hal when the 8051 would reach the end of the road. They said they had thought the 8-bit workhorse was reaching its end six or seven years ago. In anticipation, they had begun adding 32-bit CPU IP to CAST's product offering. But as history has demonstrated, the 8051 kept on going. Today though there are signs it may be loosing out to 32-bit alternatives.
Nikos pointed out that the applications that are migrating to more functionality are leaving the 8051 behind. If the data being processed comes in 8- or 16-bit resolution, simple sensors detecting on or off conditions or non-critical temperature and pressure readings, for example, then the area and power is competitive with a 32-bit solution, which might be overkill. If the data requires 32-bit resolution, such as being demanded in smart phone applications with their 6-, 9-, and now 10-degrees of freedom inertial measurement units, then 32-bit processors win hands down.
However, just as new applications came in to save the venerable 8-bit processor before, Internet of Things may yet hold some salvation for the 8051 going forward. It may find service as a controller in home monitoring systems providing WiFi, BlueTooth, and Zigbee protocol processing for communications to a central controller. Nikos says that these are the applications that the 8051 perform well. The growth of disposable sensors in medical and home health care applications could be another area of growth for the 8-bit engine.
Meet the S.A. mom who makes up to $1,600 a week from professional 'cuddling'

In a world where almost everything can be bought —from getting a ride from a stranger to having your groceries delivered — hiring someone to spoon you is one of the most unexpected services on the market.
And one San Antonio woman is a specialist.
Janet Trevino told mySA.com they are currently the only professional cuddler in San Antonio and South Texas. The 37-year-old mother of four emphasized their services, which operate through Cuddlist.com, are completely platonic and non-sexual.
As you could easily imagine, Trevino said people are usually skeptical when they tell them about their profession.
"They don't believe me," they said. "They say, 'Oh no, it can't just be cuddling, it has to go to something more sexual.' But you can have a platonic and nurturing touch."

Trevino said some customers have tried to "push the limits" of the session, but it has never gone so far that they had to cancel.
Cuddling is a full-time source of income for Trevino, who said they started last September.
In that time they have racked up a clientele of 50 people and more than 220 hours of cuddle time. Trevino noted that most of their clients are men, but they have worked with two women.
Each session lasts an hour and costs $80. Most weeks, they say, they work 13 to 20 hours. Trevino said one session lasted eight uninterrupted hours.
"It's very important that they experience touch," they said. "Touch is essential for healthy and living and they do experience a dramatic effect, I don't think we recognize how often we hold emotions in our bodies."
RELATED: Cuddlr joins ranks of Tinder, Grindr as platonic cuddling app for strangers
Trevino said some clients report that they have experienced well-rested nights of sleep and relief of chronic back pains as result of their visits.
"We hold memories in our muscles and our bodies, those emotions are there and a lot of people don't want to go there."
Aside from most of their clients being men, Trevino described some of them as being in relationships with little to no physical touch or retired military personnel who suffer from PTSD.
Trevino conducts screening calls with potential cuddling customers prior their meeting to ensure they are a match and the code of conduct for the non-sexual service will be followed.
"It's more than just spooning, you can sit and talk or watch a movie or dance," they said, adding that one client once requested to wrestle. "It could just be holding hands or sitting next to each other."
Cuddling takes place in a neutral room — in this case it's the living room of a home Trevino uses strictly for their work. Customers can opt for either the couch or a mat on the floor.
"It's about creating a culture of consent, I promise I won't do anything they're not comfortable with," Trevino explained. "I'm very conscientious and I ask before I touch a client, it's baby-stepping the whole process."
Trevino said they are able to maintain a relationship of their own, revealing that while their boyfriend trusts her, they do attend therapy.

Special for the Armenian Weekly
It all began with a tour guide video of Yerevan.
Michael They wanted to show their friends and family back home in Atlanta, Ga. the country in which they were living as an intern.
They had no prior knowledge about the country, so they followed the guide with several videos of various touristic areas and notable places around Armenia.
Michael is a junior at Harvard University studying economics. In the summer of 2015, they interned at the Central Bank of Armenia in Dilijan, through a program organized by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
With the program in its second year, Michael embarked on this internship with a research project relevant to their personal studies. In their case, they studied the business relations between Armenia and China and researched how to make Armenia more appealing for Chinese investors.
Michael's internship was in Dilijan. They were able to travel to other areas like Yerevan, Gyumri, and Tatev during the weekends, but for the most part, they stayed in the small city. “I think Armenia was actually the best experience in my life so far. I had never lived anywhere [outside of the U.S.]—including China—for as long as I lived in Armenia. Being able to go into a world about which I knew nothing about and to be able to appreciate and understand it was really great for me,” they explained during a recent visit to the Armenian Weekly and the Hairenik Association headquarters.
During their visit, Michael took a tour of East Watertown to get a sense of the Armenian community that exists so close to where they study.
Michael explained that despite the fact that they were what they called an “outsider,” the people of Armenia were very welcoming and always made them feel like a local.
During their visit, Michael said that they made their first video shortly after their internship. The video was a tour guide video of Yerevan highlighting popular destination spots in the country's capital.
Based on a variety of factors that continue to surprise Michael today, the video was shared by locals in Armenia, their coworkers at the Central Bank, Armenians from China, Armenians from America, and their friends and family back home. It eventually went viral, surpassing 150,000 views in no time.
To date, Micheal has published tour guide videos of Dilijan, Gyumri, Etchmiadzin, Garni, and Geghard. They have also made special videos for the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies, the American University of Armenia (AUA), and the Confucius State Institute at Yerevan's Brusov State University of Languages and Social Sciences. Most of their videos have even been translated into Chinese.
According to Michael, they continued with this documentary series just to show more people about the beautiful country of Armenia and the meaningful organizations that exist within the country. “I never expected these videos to garner thousands of viewers and for my experience to make an such an impression,” they explained.
More recently, Armenian-American celebrity Khloe Kardashian featured Michael's Yerevan tour guide video on their app and website. In addition, various news outlets in Armenia have published articles about Michael and their videos in an attempt to showcase Armenia through the eyes of a foreigner.
In March, Michael posted a video about the film The Promise, which gained great momentum and caused their other videos to pick up traction once again. In this two-minute video, Michael provides a brief synopsis of the film, speaks about the actors who were involved, and lists their reasons why everyone should go see it. Michael also highlights the fact that thousands of negative reviews were made on the movie website IMDB prior to the movie's release.
Since its release, this video passed 300,000 views in just the last couple of weeks and that number continuous to grow.
Micheal's video on The Promise is different than their previous ones. It doesn't highlight beautiful spots throughout Armenia or encourage people to visit. It instead clarifies a misconception people might have had about the film based on its online reviews. Michael believed these acts were wrong and felt it was necessary to use the power of social media to lay out the truth and advocate for the just cause.
In doing so, they became an unexpected activist.
When I met Michael, I was curious to find out what had inspired them to make their video about The Promise. They explained that Christian Bale, who stars in the film is also in another movie entitled The Flowers of War, which is about the 1937 Nanking massacre committed by the Japanese. Michael felt a common connection of these two events that not many people know about. They were especially intrigued, since one film was about their own culture and the other was about a culture they have spent a lot of time engaging with.
“If I could do a part to help spread the word about mass killings and injustices, through something that doesn't take much time to do yet makes an impact, I would be happy to do it,” Michael said.
They went on to say that their goal was to help people get a better historical understanding of the Armenian Genocide. “I was extremely eager for the movie to come out, because it will provide an opportunity for those who are not familiar with the history of the Armenian people to get a better understanding of the truth,” they said.
Since then, Michael has used their social media page to share links from the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA), asking American citizens to urge their Congressman to call on President Trump to properly commemorate the Armenian Genocide and of various programs in Armenia including Armenian Volunteer Corps (AVC) and the Little Free Libraries.
Meanwhile, their videos have kept circulating and continued to reach more people.
After their visit, we toured Watertown where Michael was able to see Artsakh Street, St. Stephens Armenian Apostolic Church, and some of the Armenian supermarkets of Watertown.
Michael never intended to become an activist for the Armenian cause. However, after experiencing the warmth and hospitality of the Armenian people and genuinely understanding their past, they realized that the continuous denial of the Armenian Genocide is wrong.
According to Michael, they have never attacked anyone or “picked sides.” They just took issue to the fact that the Armenian people had not received proper justice and believed that if they could do something to shed light on the cause to make an impact, they undoubtedly would.
In a world in which social media has the power to reach the masses without much effort, Michael's efforts to bring awareness have not gone unnoticed.
Their Facebook page currently has about 6,500 likes and counting. The page description—interestingly enough—includes the phrase “Armenia Enthusiast.”
Efforts to save the tiger have pushed India's population of the big cat to nearly 2,500, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar today said hailing the strides the country has made in this regard.

Highlighting the need for protecting tiger corridors, they announced incentivising project proponents to give land for compensatory afforestation in Tiger corridors.
As per the latest official count, India is home to 2,226 tigers, representing 70 per cent of the global population of the endangered big cat species.
“In the last two years, the number has risen and our rough estimate as of today is that India has nearly 2,500 tigers.

“That is good news for India… (a result) of what we are doing for the last 12 years. We have zero tolerance towards poaching,” Javadekar said at the inauguration of the 3rd Asia ministerial conference on tiger conservation.
They said that as per WWF estimates, the tiger population the world over has grown from 3,200 to 3,890 in the last five years, a 22 per cent increase.
“That is a great good news today morning,” they said on Tuesday, adding that there are only 13 countries with tigers in the wild and six of them have seen an increase in their numbers.
“That shows that we are getting success. It was a proud moment for me when we had undertaken a tiger count in 2014…When I wrote 2,226 as India's tiger count it was fantastic as it was 30 per cent more than the last count. This is 70 per cent of the world tiger population,” they said.
Stating that the tiger epitomises the health of the ecosystem, they stressed that success with tiger conservation means the whole ecosystem is improving.
“We are taking a historic decision to protect tiger corridors. We will incentivise project proponents to give land for compensatory afforestation in tiger corridors. By such measures over the years, we can free the tiger corridors and these will become forest land,” they said.
“We have started a unique experiment with new standard operating procedures (SOPs) for orphaned tiger cubs. This has started yielding results and four such orphaned tigers have been released back into the wild after proper care in ‘in situ' enclosures,” they said.
Javadekar lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment towards tiger conservation and said they had adopted the best conservation practices during their tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
“The growing number of lions in Gujarat is a testimony to their efforts,” the minister said.
They also referred to the increase in the budget for Project Tiger from Rs 185 crore to Rs 380 crore, adding that, with the 60:40 participation of states, this increase translates to Rs 500 crore in one year for tiger protection.
Chairman of the Global Tiger Forum and Minister of Agriculture & Forests, Bhutan, Yeshey Dorji, also addressed the gathering.

Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ashok Lavasa, delivered the vote of thanks.
Creating Susan Sontag
Susan Sontag created Susan Sontag. The first volume of their journals and notebooks, Reborn, made that clear. As their son and the journals' editor David Rieff writes, the entries show a young person who “self-consciously and determinedly went about creating the self they wanted to be.” The recently published second volume, As Consciousness is Harnessed to Flesh, reinforces the notion that they – and, by extension, we – can consciously create our identities, or at least personas. However, the two volumes also show that, no matter how much Sontag created their ideal self, she, like us all, faced limits to how much they could change.
The two volumes cover very different periods of Sontag's life. The first consists of entries from 1947 to 1963, roughly ages 14 to 30, a time in which they studied at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, got married, had their first and only child, got divorced, lived in two continents and wrote their first novel. The second volume, documenting 1964 to 1980, shows their entries from ages 31 to 47, a period in which they published their best-known works, became an icon and battled cancer. It's easy to feel like an underachiever in comparison to Sontag's professional success.
This success – and moreover, the freedoms and abilities that it brought – in many ways represents the accomplishments of goals that Sontag set in their earlier journals. “I want to write – I want to live in an intellectual atmosphere – I want to live in a cultural center where I can hear a great deal of music – and this and much more,” they write in a February 1949 entry, after arriving at the University of California, Berkeley, at age 16. She, of course, went on to be a prolific writer, live in several cultural centers and counted some of the twentieth century's most renowned intellectuals, writers and artists among their friends.
Despite their successes, they never stopped trying to transform themselves into the person that they wanted to be. Sontag never felt that they “had made it,” that it was okay to stop becoming and just be. At age 24, their list of things to do (and not do) included showering every other night (a “do”) and not publicly criticizing anyone at Harvard. Twenty years later, their list of rules included getting up in the morning no later than eight and writing in the notebook every day, using Georg Lichtenberg's Waste Books as a model. They also remained a forever student – as Rieff writes, their success, if anything, made them more of a student, rather than less.
As part of their autodidactic program, Sontag's journals and notebooks were primarily a place where they worked through ideas, some of which went on to become the ones that made famous. These notes on literature, film, philosophy and culture are valuable in themselves and make the journals worth reading, even if someone has no interest in other aspects of Sontag's life.
However, what the journals accomplish most is humanizing Sontag. For better or worse, they show a side to them not found in their essays or novels – a Susan Sontag that had their heart broken time and time again, who was plagued by insecurities, including a fear of being alone. As Sontag wrote in one 1970 entry, while in another unstable love affair, “If I'm not safe in the deepest relationship, I can't really give my attention to other things too. I'm always turning my head back, to look anxiously if the other person is still there.”
It's Sontag's most emotional entries, which usually focus on difficult or failed relationships, that differ most from the pieces that they published during their lifetime. In that sense, some of the most profound elements of Sontag's journals are not their thoughts on the books they read, the films they saw and the politics they observed. The reader already has at least some grasp of their ideas on these topics from their published works and interviews. What matters most about the journals is that they show Susan Sontag the human being, not the Susan Sontag, the persona that they fashioned for the world to see.
For that reason, as much as the journals are about Sontag creating their ideal self, they are also about the parts that they could not change. No matter what Sontag accomplished professionally, how many people admired them and how many they book they read, they did not stop fearing being alone, loving people who did not love them back and always feeling that they were a work in progress. At least not as of 1980, when the second volume of their journals ends. We can only wait and see what unfolds in the final volume.

The Fuzzing Project
Fuzzing is a powerful strategy to find bugs in software. The idea is quite simple: Generate a large number of randomly malformed inputs for a software to parse and see what happens. If the program crashes then something is likely wrong. While fuzzing is a well-known strategy, it is surprisingly easy to find bugs, often with security implications, in widely used software.
Memory access errors are the errors most likely to be exposed when fuzzing software that is written in C/C++. While they differ in the details (stack overflow, heap overflow, use after free, ...), the core problem is often the same: A software reads or writes to wrong memory locations.
A modern Linux or BSD system ships a large number of basic tools that do some kind of file displaying and parsing. In their current state most of these tools are not suitable for untrusted inputs.
On the other hand we have powerful tools these days that allow us to find and analyze these bugs, notably the fuzzing tool american fuzzy lop and the Address Sanitizer feature of gcc and clang.
The Fuzzing Project is trying to improve the state of things. I maintain some helpful pointers how you can join the effort to improve the state of security in free software.
In 1979, director Franco Zeffirelli remade a 1931 Oscar-winning film called The Champ, about a washed-up boxer trying to mount a comeback in the ring. Zeffirelli's version got tepid reviews. The Rotten Tomatoes website gives it only a 38 percent approval rating. But The Champ did succeed in launching the acting career of 9-year-old Ricky Schroder, who was cast as the son of the boxer. At the movie's climax, the boxer, played by Jon Voight, dies in front of their young son. “Champ, wake up!” sobs an inconsolable T.J., played by Schroder. The performance would win them a Golden Globe Award.
It would also make a lasting contribution to science. The final scene of The Champ has become a must-see in psychology laboratories around the world when scientists want to make people sad.
The Champ has been used in experiments to see if depressed people are more likely to cry than non-depressed people (they aren't). It has helped determine whether people are more likely to spend money when they are sad (they are) and whether older people are more sensitive to grief than younger people (older people did report more sadness when they watched the scene). Dutch scientists used the scene when they studied the effect of sadness on people with binge eating disorders (sadness didn't increase eating).
The story of how a mediocre movie became a good tool for scientists dates back to 1988, when Robert Levenson, a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and their graduate student, James Gross, started soliciting movie recommendations from colleagues, film critics, video store employees and movie buffs. They were trying to identify short film clips that could reliably elicit a strong emotional response in laboratory settings.
It was a harder job than the researchers expected. Instead of months, the project ended up taking years. “Everybody thinks it's easy,” Levenson says.
Levenson and Gross, now a professor at Stanford, ended up evaluating more than 250 films and film clips. They edited the best ones into segments a few minutes long and selected 78 contenders. They screened selections of clips before groups of undergraduates, eventually surveying nearly 500 viewers on their emotional responses to what they saw on-screen.
Some film scenes were rejected because they elicited a mixture of emotions, maybe anger and sadness from a scene depicting an act of injustice, or disgust and amusement from a bathroom comedy gag. The psychologists wanted to be able to produce one predominant, intense emotion at a time. They knew that if they could do it, creating a list of films proven to generate discrete emotions in a laboratory setting would be enormously useful.
Scientists testing emotions in research subjects have resorted to a variety of techniques, including playing emotional music, exposing volunteers to hydrogen sulfide (“fart spray”) to generate disgust or asking subjects to read a series of depressing statements like “I have too many bad things in my life” or “I want to go to sleep and never wake up.” They've rewarded test subjects with money or cookies to study happiness or made them perform tedious and frustrating tasks to study anger.
“In the old days, we used to be able to induce fear by giving people electric shocks,” Levenson says.
Ethical concerns now put more constraints on how scientists can elicit negative emotions. Sadness is especially difficult. How do you induce a feeling of loss or failure in the laboratory without resorting to deception or making a test subject feel miserable?
“You can't tell them something horrible has happened to their family, or tell them they have some terrible disease,” says William Frey II, a University of Minnesota neuroscientist who has studied the composition of tears.
But as Gross says, “films have this really unusual status.” People willingly pay money to see tearjerkers—and walk out of the theater with no apparent ill effect. As a result, “there's an ethical exemption” to making someone emotional with a film, Gross says.
In 1995, Gross and Levenson published the results of their test screenings. They came up with a list of 16 short film clips able to elicit a single emotion, such as anger, fear or surprise. Their recommendation for inducing disgust was a short film showing an amputation. Their top-rated film clip for amusement was the fake orgasm scene from When Harry Met Sally. And then there's the two-minute, 51-second clip of Schroder weeping over their father's dead body in The Champ, which Levenson and Gross found produced more sadness in laboratory subjects than the death of Bambi's mom.
“I still feel sad when I see that boy crying their heart out,” Gross says.
“It's wonderful for our purposes,” Levenson says. “The theme of irrevocable loss, it's all compressed into that two or three minutes.”
Researchers are using the tool to study not just what sadness is, but how it makes us behave. Do we cry more, do we eat more, do we smoke more, do we spend more when we're sad? Since Gross and Levenson gave The Champ two thumbs-up as the saddest movie scene they could find, their research has been cited in more than 300 scientific articles. The movie has been used to test the ability of computers to recognize emotions by analyzing people's heart rate, temperature and other physiological measures. It has helped show that depressed smokers take more puffs when they are sad.
In a recent study, neuroscientist Noam Sobel at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel showed the film clip to women to collect tears for a study to test the sexual arousal of men exposed to weepy women. They found that when men sniffed tear-filled vials or tear-soaked cotton pads, their testosterone levels fell, they were less likely to rate pictures of women's faces as attractive, and the part of their brains that normally light up in MRI scans during sexual arousal were less active.
Other researchers kept test subjects up all night and then showed them clips from The Champ and When Harry Met Sally. Sleep deprivation made people look about as expressive, the team found, as a zombie.
“I found it very sad. I find most people do,” says Jared Minkel of Duke University, who ran the sleep-deprivation study. “The Champ seems to be very effective in eliciting fairly pure feeling states of sadness and associated cognitive and behavioral changes.”
Other films have been used to produce sadness in the lab. When they needed to collect tears from test subjects in the early 1980s, Frey says they relied on a film called All Mine to Give, about a pioneer family in which the father and mother die and the children are divided up and sent to the homes of strangers.
“Just the sound of the music and I would start crying,” Frey says.
But Levenson says they believe the list of films they developed with Gross is the most widely used by emotion researchers. And of the 16 movies clips they identified, The Champ may be the one that has been used the most by researchers.
“I think sadness is a particularly attractive emotion for people to try to understand,” Gross says.
Richard Chin is a journalist from St. Paul, Minnesota.

Babies on board!
On Tuesday, Amal Clooney stepped out for the first time since news of their pregnancy – with twins! – broke, but masked any hint of a baby bump.
Get push notifications with news, features and more.
The human-rights attorney, 39, wore a vibrant red, ankle-length overcoat with a minidress, black tights and motorcycle boots while on their way to a salon in London.
Multiple sources confirmed Amal's pregnancy with husband George Clooney to PEOPLE earlier this month, revealing that she's due this spring. The babies are the first children for both.
The couple have been spending time in the U.K. over the past few months, quietly nesting at their renovated English mansion in a small town in the countryside west of London.

George, 55, opened up for the first time about the news this week, telling Laurent Weil on their French program, Rencontres de Cinema, “We are really happy and really excited.”
They added, “It's going to be an adventure. We've sort of embraced it all … with arms wide open.”
South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor known for their aggressive style of questioning at congressional hearings, has been tapped to lead a select committee tasked with investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks.
House Speaker John Boehner made the announcement Monday afternoon.
"With four of our countrymen killed at the hands of terrorists, the American people want answers, accountability, and justice," they said. "Trey Gowdy is as dogged, focused, and serious-minded as they come."
Boehner said Gowdy's courtroom background makes them the "ideal person" to lead the newly announced investigation.
Gowdy said in a statement they were "honored" to serve as chairperson. "While people are free to draw different conclusions from the facts, there should be no debate over whether the American public is entitled to have all of the facts," they said.
Gowdy's name had been high on the short list ever since the speaker announced Friday they would call a House vote on forming a select committee. Boehner had long resisted calls for such a probe, but reversed course after newly released emails raised questions about the White House role in shaping the administration's public narrative after the attack.
Other names mentioned for the job by Capitol Hill insiders had included Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas; Rep. Mike Turner R-Ohio; Rep. John Mica R-Fla.; Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.; and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.
But Gowdy seemed to attract the most attention. Gowdy is a second-term lawmaker, a former district attorney and federal prosecutor, and a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
The Gowdy selection was read by some as a blow to House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and their probe into the 2012 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans including Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. In fact, some sources on Capitol Hill argue that one of the reasons a select committee has been commissioned is to specifically sideline Issa. Issa's staff and the staff of the House Armed Services Committee got into a public dispute last week about the credibility of a Benghazi witness at an oversight committee hearing.
Issa, though, praised the selection on Monday, saying Boehner "could not have chosen a Member more committed to getting the full truth about the before, during, and after of the Benghazi terrorist attacks than Congressman Trey Gowdy."
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney disputed the need for another investigation, saying Monday that Congress is "not short" on these kinds of probes.
"You know at some point you just have to assume Republicans will continue this because it feeds a political objective of some sort," they said of Benghazi allegations.
There appears to have been no direct contact between the Speaker's Office and the Minority Leader's Office about the creation of the committee despite Friday's announcement of its pending inception.
House leadership sources also aren't sure when they'll release text of the actual resolution creating the select committee. Such language in the resolution would explain the scope and parameters of the probe, the select committee's jurisdiction and its cost.
The office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. indicated that a vote on a measure to prepare for the Benghazi committee could come as early as this week.

Jabalpur: Five Congressmen were injured on Monday when son of BJP MLA Pratibha Singh opened fire at their rivals while campaigning at Mankhedi village under the Jabalpur Lok Sabha seat following a dispute, police said.
"Golu Singh, who has a past criminal record, fired at their rivals following a dispute in which five Congressmen identified as Durjan Patel, Abhay Pratap, Nilesh Singh, Rakesh
Patel and Roopsingh Patel suffered injuries," Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Makrand Deoskar told reporters.
Among the injured, four were admitted to government medical college here for treatment, where their condition is said to be stable, they said.
Congress candidate and noted lawyer from Jabalpur Lok Sabha seat Vivek Tankha reached the hospital where a large number of Congressmen gathered and held protest demanding action against the accused.
So far, Singh has not been arrested, the police said.
A 41-year-old man died Tuesday after being struck by a pickup truck in St. Paul's North End, police said Wednesday.
Police arrested the 38-year-old driver, who officers believed was possibly under the influence of alcohol, said Sgt. Mike Ernster, a St. Paul police spokesperson.
At about 2 a.m. Monday, people reported hearing a crash in the area of Larpenteur Avenue and Wanda Street, a block from Jackson Street. Ta Ku Htoo, of St. Paul, was found lying in the grass on the south side of Larpenteur Avenue, Ernster said.
Htoo had been walking in the road when they were struck by a pickup truck heading east on Larpenteur, according to Ernster. There are not sidewalks on that side of the street.
Paramedics took Htoo to Regions Hospital with a head injury, and they died Tuesday.
Responding officers smelled the odor of alcohol on the driver, identified as Jeremy Michael Ranft, and arrested them at the scene on suspicion of criminal vehicular operation, Ernster said. Police obtained a search warrant to draw Ranft's blood for testing; results are pending.
Ranft, of Savage, has not been charged and the Ramsey County attorney's office said the matter remains under review, pending the completion of further investigation. Ranft was released from the Ramsey County jail on Monday and said Wednesday that they didn't want to discuss the matter.
Four years ago, also on July 3, Ranft was arrested in Scott County. They pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DWI, according to a court record.
Htoo's family said Wednesday they are saddened by their loss and looking for answers about what happened. Htoo was walking to their St. Paul apartment with a friend when they were struck.
Htoo came to St. Paul about five years ago from a refugee camp in Thailand and worked hard to take care of their family, said Eh Doe Soe, Htoo's 19-year-old son. They worked on an assembly line cutting meat at Albert Lea Select Foods, traveling about 100 miles each way between Albert Lea and St. Paul, for the last four years.
Htoo was a very good worker who was well-liked with their co-workers, said Pay Kay, their supervisor at Albert Lea Select Foods.

Arrow dodged network ax, took time to get good
by Charissa Jelliff
"Arrow still isn't a perfect show, but it was definitely worth sitting through those voiceovers and other misfires in the stumbling episodes early in season 1."
advertisement
Spoiler warning: This column discusses recent plot details for Arrow. Proceed with caution.
With so many television shows on the air to choose from, a series has to be conscientious of its audience and draw viewers in quickly or risk cancelation. However, some shows take a little longer than others to prove they're worth watching. Last week, I talked about how Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't really hit its stride until Captain America: The Winter Soldier completely changed the rules. Another superhero-based show, Arrow, has similarly improved with time.
When Arrow premiered, I never considered not watching it, although I had enjoyed Justin Hartley's portrayal of Oliver Queen on Smallville and wasn't looking forward to seeing someone new in the role so soon. When I heard The CW was going with a darker, grittier tone for the series — more like the Christopher Nolan Batman films — I began to get more interested in the show and feel a little more comfortable with a new actor in the role. I was not at all familiar with Stephen Amell when they were cast, so I was curious to see what this version of the Green Arrow story would be like.
Arrow began with Oliver's rescue from the island where they had been stranded for five years. They were brought home to a mother, sister, and friends who all believed they had died when their father's yacht sank. After their return to Starling City, Oliver took on the identity of “the Hood,” seeking out corrupted men whom their father had named in a secret journal. The show is also punctuated with flashbacks of Oliver's time on the island — their transformation into the Oliver Queen of the present day.
While I enjoyed the show from the beginning, I didn't love it. For one thing, I really hated the use of voiceovers in the early episodes. There's an art to using a voiceover well, and Arrow just didn't get that. (See Burn Notice for an example of good voiceover use.) Clearly, Oliver needed someone else on their side to speak to and share their plans with. Thankfully, the powers that be understood this as well, and it wasn't long before Oliver was forced to take their bodyguard, John Diggle, into their confidence. Almost immediately, the voiceovers ceased, which improved the show greatly.
The flashbacks were another questionable style choice from my perspective. Like voiceovers, there's an art to properly using flashbacks without making them seem overdone or pointless. While I didn't love the flashbacks at first, they have grown on me as we've seen more of the island where Oliver was marooned. I liked the casting of Manu Bennett as Slade Wilson, one of Oliver's few allies on the island, and I prefer Sara Lance on the island to their presence in Starling City. The parallels to the present day and the consequences of the choices made on the island are much clearer this season, making the flashbacks themselves much more relevant.
Another improvement came with the addition of Felicity Smoak to Team Arrow. Felicity recurred during the first half of the first season, then discovered Oliver's true identity around the middle of the year. They quickly became a fan favorite as well as a favored love interest for Oliver. To be honest, there were many times during the first season in which Diggle and Felicity were the main incentive to keep watching the show. I loved those two characters, and while I began to like Oliver more and more, Diggle and Felicity were still my favorites. Even now, I think I like them just a little more than I do Oliver.
The last several episodes of season 1 really began to show how potentially great this series could be, all leading straight from one into the next as a multi-part finale. In the season-ender, the writers raised the stakes even higher by killing Oliver's best friend, suddenly showing fans that characters on this show aren't as safe as we think they are.
The momentum from the finale carried over into the second season and set up a complete change in Oliver. In order to honor their friend Tommy's memory, Oliver changed their methods: they decided they will no longer hunt down the names in their father's journal and they will not shoot to kill. As much as I hated seeing Colin Donnell leave the series, this was the turning point that pushed the series from, “eh, it's not bad,” to, “wow, this is really good TV.”
This second season has been a huge improvement over the first. Oliver is now one year removed from the island and has settled into life back home; despite losing their best friend, they have found a renewed purpose in their mission. Ever since the midseason reveal that Slade, the man who taught Oliver to fight and survive on the island, was still alive and plotting against Oliver, the season has improved even more.
The last few episodes have left me on the edge of my seat, and I'm sure many fans are still reeling from Moira Queen's death two weeks ago in an episode that marked the start of a four-part season finale arc. Honestly, if the writers of Arrow were behind other DC Comics properties, like the new Batman vs. Superman and Justice League films, I'd probably be a lot less worried about how they're going to turn out.
Arrow still isn't a perfect show, but it was definitely worth sitting through those voiceovers and other misfires in the stumbling episodes early in season 1. The characters have each evolved over the course of this season, Oliver's sister Thea in particular. I used to find them merely annoying and spoiled, but they really has matured a lot from the girl who partied too hard and crashed the brand-new car they received for their birthday last year. I only hope this trend continues next season.
My biggest complaint with the show at the moment is that the writers don't seem to understand that Laurel Lance just doesn't fit in this show. While the other characters have grown and added depth in season 2, Laurel seems to have remained pretty much static over two seasons — occasionally they take steps forward only to fall farther back. I've tried to like her, and I have nothing against Katie Cassidy, but every scene Laurel is in — except the scenes that feature only Laurel and their sister Sara — just feels awkward and forced. While the show itself continues to raise the stakes and improve on a weekly basis, Laurel is holding it back from becoming really great. I have a feeling Laurel won't be going away anytime soon, especially if the show wants to follow comic mythology, but I hope writers recognize the failings in their character and start improving the way they write them
As I mentioned above, the season finale has essentially been a four-part episode, with the third part airing last night. Judging from the suspense of these last three episodes, I can only imagine what the finale has in store. I predict Oliver is going to have to team up with their previous enemy, Malcolm Merlyn (because I won't believe Thea shot them until I see a body to prove it) in order to get rid of Slade, and I can't wait to see how that plays out. I'm excited to have John Barrowman back on the show, and I love seeing unlikely allies forced to work together; it always brings out interesting aspects of each character.
I've read that the show will shift somewhat in tone again going into season 3, and I can only hope it continues improving as it has this season.
Sure, there are some shows that just aren't worth your time and you're better off giving up on them. I probably should have quit on Heroes after season 2, but I just couldn't let go. (Even worse, I'll probably check out the new series when it premieres.) And then there are some shows that you will love right from the start, but the network just won't get behind them. (I'm looking at you Fox: how dare you cancel Almost Human.)
Then there are the shows like Arrow and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that just need a little extra time to live up to their potential. And once they do, you won't regret a minute you spend watching them.

From its birth in the labs of Tim Berners-Lee back in 1992, to its interaction with the Napster in 1999, and its 2004 induction of Wikipedia: the Internet as we know it, has evolved drastically, been around the world literally, and changed the way humans live permanently.
Nothing can replace it, nothing is like it, and it has no alternative. The internet is like a diamond mine for the people who wish to acquire wealth, a profound lake of information for those who have an insatiable appetite for knowledge base, and an eternal form of entertainment for those wish to amuse themselves.
With the passage of time, people from amongst us have emerged with the craziest of ideas to test and enhance the potential of this God's gift to humankind. And it is due to the efforts of these noble souls, that we have the entire world at the simple tap of our fingers.
In no particular order, Skidzopedia provides you with a list of those people who have influenced the Internet greatly.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin – Google Inc.
Two PhDs from Stanford University started work in the garage of a friend's. And they were defiantly not building steam engines!
They were, however, creating the internet's most powerful search engine. Sergey Brin and Larry Page are arguably the world's most successful Internet entrepreneurs and developers in history. This enabled them to earn billions, while assisting everyone from high school students to particle physicists have an easy time searching for information over the internet.
Google was first launched on Stanford's website (google.stanford.edu) and then finally on Google.com in 1997. It is estimated that GOOGLE is worth about a staggering $25 billion dollars.
David Filo and Jerry Yang – Yahoo! Inc.
Yahoo! too is the creation of two Stanford University's Electrical Engineer graduates, called Jerry Yang and David Filo. Yang started by listing web pages on the Internet and named it “Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web”. Then, they decided to switch it to Yahoo! and the initial URL was at akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo
In December 1994, that particular website had already received over a million hits. Realizing its potential, David Filo and Jerry Yang got serious and diversified Yahoo! as a web portal.
David Filo's net worth is $2.9 billion dollars and Jerry Yang's is $2.3 billion dollars.
Bill Gates – Microsoft
William Henry “Bill” Gates III, is an American business magnate, philanthropist, the world's third richest person (as of February 8, 2008), and chairperson of Microsoft, the software company they founded with Paul Allen.
Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. In the later stages of their career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.
Gates also holds the record of being the Richest Person in the world for 15 consecutive years.
Colorado water planners are ahead of other states in anticipating shortfalls on the Colorado River, but realize cooperation is needed all along the river as its resources are stretched.
��� An interim report by the Bureau of Reclamation this week outlines a 50-year scenario that could mean less water supply even as demand increases because of population growth and a longer growing season.
��� The report provides scenarios compiled from various climate models. While the models differ on precipitation, all indicate there will be, on average, hotter temperatures, earlier runoff and a greater percentage of moisture from rain than snow in the next 50 years.
��� The result could mean a 10 percent reduction in supply.
��� �The report is important because you�re trying to balance higher demand against the available supply,� said Alan Hamel, executive director of the Pueblo Board of Water Works and a member of the Colorado Water Conservation Board. �Colorado is ahead of the other states that receive some of their supply from the Colorado River, but we can still garner important information out of the study.�
��� The Arkansas Basin Roundtable on Wednesday heard an update on the CWCB�s study of availability of water from the Colorado River. It is important to most of the state, because about 500,000 acre-feet of supplemental water is imported each year to the Front Range communities in the Arkansas and South Platte basins.
��� There is still frustration because so much information is available, while the changes in climate are uncertain.
��� �The more uncertainty we have, the wider the range of results,� said Matt Brown, a consultant with AECOM engineering.
���� The Colorado River basin touches seven states and drains 242,000 square miles, it is geographically diverse � just look at the mix of drought-induced wildfires and record snowpack this year. It also contains distinct climate zones over a range of 14,000 feet in elevation.
�� That may seem like a lot of territory, but long-term climate models cannot accurately reflect changes that might occur in the region. There are more than 125 climate models to choose from, and the CWCB could afford to analyze the projected impacts in only five of those, Brown explained.
��� The 1922 Colorado River Compact was negotiated among the seven states � Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming � at a time when more water was available in the basin. At the time, it was estimated 16.4 million acre-feet annually were available from the river, but the actual number is between 13.2 million-14.3 million acre-feet annually.
��� In 2007, the states agreed on a 20-year plan to share shortages and balance storage between Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
��� Colorado officials, however, remain wary that a call on the Colorado River by downstream states could curtail water rights claimed after 1922 � including the vast majority of diversions to the Front Range.
��� Hamel and other water leaders have been involved in a water banking plan involving Blue Mesa Reservoir on the Gunnison River as a way to protect the junior rights in Colorado. Negotiations with Reclamation are still a few years away, they said.
��� In the meantime, more storage is needed on both sides of the mountains within Colorado, Hamel said.
��� �Storage becomes even more important when you talk about climate change,� Hamel said. �We will need more reservoirs to collect rain as well as snow melt, and to balance the cycles between wet and dry years.�
��� Along with other members of the roundtable, Hamel would like to see the state studies home in on how the specific needs of the Arkansas River basin would be affected by climate change. Longer growing seasons are likely in the eastern part of the state as well � although there is scant evidence of that actually happening � and water needs for agricultural use could increase.
��� �We have to balance municipal and industrial needs with agriculture while protecting the environment and recreation,� Hamel said.
�� Other municipal water suppliers also hailed Reclamation�s study of the entire basin as a step forward in meeting future needs. The Colorado River supports 30 million people, most of them living in metropolitan areas that divert water from remote locations.
�� Denver Water recently announced the Colorado River Cooperative Agreement with 35 partners on the Western Slope.
��� �That agreement achieves greater certainty for our present and future supplies,� said Jim Lochhead, CEO and manager of Denver Water. �Given the potential impacts of climate change and drought throughout the Colorado River basin, we need to work actively toward a similar collaboration for the entire Colorado River Basin.�
��� Denver and Aurora have joined Colorado River Municipal Utilities, which includes the largest water utilities in Arizona, California and Nevada.
� Collectively, they use 15 percent of the river�s water, but have issued a statement that says joint use of the river is required to fill environmental, recreational and agricultural needs.
��� �The Colorado River�s impact, not only on the state, but the entire southwest United States, is so extreme that all parties must work together to find solutions to future water shortages,� said Mark Pifher, director of Aurora Water.
NEW YORK — Juan Lagares capped the Mets' impressive comeback against the Atlanta Braves by hitting a three-run blast in the sixth inning to erase a one-run deficit and lift the club to a 10-8 win Sunday at Citi Field.
For their game-winning efforts, Lagares earned a coveted prize — a championship wrestling belt featuring the Mets logo in the center.
The bestowing of the belt has become a tradition following every Mets win. Manager Terry Collins said Michael Cuddyer started the custom at the beginning of the season as a way to bring more excitement and fun to the clubhouse.
"It's a major event," Collins said. "Every guy is in there to see who wins the award every night."
John Mayberry Jr. said the conferring of the belt typically occurs in the middle of the clubhouse and is a can't-miss event.
"Everybody just gathers around, hoopin' and hollerin', present it and everybody goes crazy," Mayberry said. "You definitely look forward to getting it. You want to win it. I'm kind of being facetious. Win first, then you do something silly at the end to add to the camaraderie or whatever - excitement."
As the keeper of the belt, Cuddyer typically decides which player merits the award after each victory. On Sunday, Lagares was the lucky recipient, as they finished 3-for-5 with a career high-tying three RBIs against the Braves.
It was the first time the center fielder earned the belt this season.
"That's a great feeling," Lagares said as the belt gleamed prominently in their locker. "I hope it stays there tomorrow."

The YoGen hand-held charger is one we talked about back in October, and I finally got to see it in action at CES. It was one of the more popular booths in the Sustainable Planet section, and after trying out the product, I could see why. I also got a demonstration of their prototype pedal-powered charger for laptops, which is reportedly capable of a 50 Watt charge, with just an easy push of a pedal. Check it out.
A 5 Watt charge can be generated with a very easy pull of the string. It doesn't matter how fast or slow you pull, the same charge is generated. And I'm told it gives the same charge as if you were plugging into a wall, so 1 minute of pulling is equal to the same amount of talk time you'd get after 1 minute of wall charging, or about 5 minutes of talk time. It's intended as a solution for quick emergency charging.
The laptop prototype is intended for the same thing. The engineer who created the device told me that it will be able to extend the life of a fully charged laptop battery by 2 to 3 times, and will allow a person to start working immediately even when their laptop battery is completely dead.
(Ignore the sound...it was loud and they were soft spoken..just focus on the pedal action)
The final version, I'm told, will come out around the fall, will weigh less than two pounds, and will have a price point of around $100. It's an extra two pounds to cart around in your laptop bag, but if you're nervous you'll run out of charge and will need power immediately, this is a good option.

(What's happening with the Arkansas Razorbacks? Make sure you're in the loop --- take five seconds to Sign up for our FREE Razorbacks newsletter now!)
Arkansas' comeback win at LSU on Saturday kept the Razorbacks firmly on the bubble.
The victory resulted in a jump of six spots to No. 43 in the NCAA's official RPI, which is a major factor used by the NCAA Tournament selection committee. That is just within the typical range of at-large bids.
As noted in our story last Sunday, the highest RPI of a Power Five team to be left out of the tournament since the field expanded to 68 teams in 2011 was No. 49 Missouri in 2014.
So let's compare that Tigers squad to this year's Arkansas team...
21-10 (9-9) Regular-season record 18-7 (7-5) 8th SEC Tourney seed 4th 49 RPI 43 74 Strength of schedule 79 151 Non-conf. SOS 55 2 (home vs. 14, 42) Top 50 RPI wins 2 (home vs. 44; road vs. 46) 5 (home vs. 66, 77, 88; road vs. 55, 77) Wins vs. RPI 51-100 5 (home vs. 57, 74, 91; road vs. 64, 94) 2 (road vs. 120, 124) Losses vs. RPI 101-200 1 (home vs. 121) 0 Losses vs. RPI 201+ 1 (road vs. 242)
Missouri had a signature win - something the Razorbacks currently lack - when it beat a ranked UCLA team at home during non-conference play. The Tigers also lacked a really bad loss, which Arkansas had on the road at Missouri.
However, Arkansas' non-conference strength of schedule this season was much better than the Tigers' during the 2013-14 season. The Razorbacks' overall strength of schedule is slightly worse, but it will likely increase after road trips to South Carolina (Wednesday) and Florida (March 1).
With six games remaining, Arkansas needs only three wins to reach the 21-win mark of Missouri. A four-win finish to reach 22 wins before the SEC Tournament is not outside the realm of possibility, either.
ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI), a metic with multiple factors that generates season projections, gives the Razorbacks at least a 71 percent chance to win in half of their final six regular-season games. They are large underdogs at South Carolina and Florida and slight underdogs at Auburn, as seen in this chart:
at South Carolina 23.4 vs. Ole Miss 74.3 vs. Texas A&M 74.0 at Auburn 43.1 at Florida 5.9 vs. Georgia 71.7
Using these figures, you can calculate how likely it is for Arkansas to finish 6-0, 0-6 or anywhere in between.
6-0 0.23 5-1 5.08 4-2 23.56 3-3 37.97 2-4 25.11 1-5 7.29 0-6 0.78
The Razorbacks have a 28.9 percent chance to win at least four games down the stretch, which would get them to 22-9 entering the SEC Tournament. If they go 1-1 in the SEC Tournament like Missouri did in 2014, Arkansas would be sitting at 23-10 on Selection Sunday.
As for the RPI, using the RPI Wizard tool, Arkansas would be about No. 32 with losses to South Carolina and Florida and wins against everyone else. That would be well within the typical at-large bid range.
Assuming Arkansas remained fourth in the SEC standings and lost to the No. 5 seed - which is currently Alabama - in the first round of the SEC Tournament, it would still stay in the top 40 in the RPI.
Even if you add a loss to Auburn for a 3-3 finish, Arkansas' projected RPI would be No. 40, which is also usually good enough for an at-large bid. That would likely require a win in the SEC Tournament, though.
This may seem like putting the cart ahead of the horse, as the Razorbacks have proven to be inconsistent, but there is definitely a clear path to the NCAA Tournament.

The Manuka Belt - Charcoal finish
Hi Kickstarters, thanks for checking out our project! We've spent the last six months designing and refining the Manuka Belt. This design revolutionises the boring common belt, making it smoother and simpler. Instead of a buckle and holes mechanism, the Manuka Belt uses a series of powerful magnets. We reckon we've made the perfect belt for you, and now we need your help to get it produced.
The Manuka Belt - Raw and Charcoal
Key features
The Manuka Belt is a magnetic belt made with neodymium rubber composite. We mix the material to our exact specifications and then magnetise it to give it its unique properties. The magnetic design does away with any fastening clasp. Instead the two sides of the belt are held together by the powerful magnetic force. To us, the beauty is in the simplicity.
It will hold your pants up - The magnetic poles are orientated along the belt in a vertical direction, which holds the belt in place when closed and stops it from slipping. The magnets are super strong and will take well over 20 pounds of force before budging - easily strong enough to hold up your pants.
It loosens just like a normal belt - The vertical magnetic poles act like virtual belt notches. The belt loosens in half inch increments, just like a normal belt would, but without any holes, or buckle.
Leather belts with their shiny buckles are just so 1.0.
Alternating magnetic poles along the belt's length prevent slipping and work as virtual belt notches
Our story
The Manuka Belt has been designed and spec'd over the last six months and with the final prototypes complete, we are ready for our first order. We need a minimum order to get our material in bulk, and to build the equipment to mass-magnetise the neodymium rubber.
Tech specs
MANUKA BELT - Natural wooden finish
Belt width: 40mm
Belt depth: 3mm
Belt length: Adjustable based on waist size
Belt weight: 600g
The standard belt length is cut for your waist size - we'll ask for your exact dimensions following the Kickstarter campaign to make sure you get one that fits properly.
The magnetic forces are easily strong enough to hold your pants up, but will not effect your credit cards, phones, hard-drives kept in your pockets or held in bags at waist height.

FAQs
Why do I need a magnetic belt?
If you are asking yourself this question, then you probably don't. But think about how boring standard leather buckle-up belts are. We're different. We think you are too.
Will the belt fit in my belt loops?
The Manuka Belt is 4cm wide, which is slim enough to fit in the vast majority of belt loops. We can make a slimmer belt (down to 3cm) on special request. The closing mechanism of the belt works just as well over the belt loops, as it does when slipped under the loops.
Won't this ruin my credit cards?
No. The magnets within the belt are easily strong enough to keep your pants up, but wont wipe your credit cards or screw up your phone or hard drive. We've been playing with the materials for months, rubbing them against our phones, hard disks and computers, and have never seen any effect.
Is this magnetic belt really safe?
Yes, completely. Carrying around or wearing magnets is absolutely safe. There are people who claim health benefits from being exposed to permanent magnetic fields, but we don't make any health claims.
How do I pay for shipping?
Don't worry about shipping. International shipping is included for every reward listed.
Where do I enter my shipping address?
After the campaign ends, you will receive an email requesting your shipping address.
Can I get my belt in a different color?
After the campaign ends, you will receive an email asking which color belt you would like. Belts are available in charcoal or natural wooden finishes. If you would like a completely different color or design go for the Bespoke Manuka Belt and we will make one in the color or design of your choice. If you go for the Bespoke Manuka, we will need a design (11820 x 440 pixels) in one of the standard graphics formats to get the belt made. NEW REWARD: THE MANUKA COLOR PALETTE. You can get the Manuka Belt in any color listed in the palette below. After the campaign we'll send out a survey asking which color you prefer.
What waist size will the belt fit?
The belt can accommodate any size waist. After the campaign ends, you will receive an email requesting your waist size. The belt will be specifically manufactured for your size. All belts for waists above 38” will be manufactured from two neodymium rubber strips.
How much will this belt retail for after Kickstarter?

A nationwide survey of assemblywomen said Friday that just over 54 percent of female lawmakers feel uncomfortable when exposed to sexist acts, remarks or verbal abuse from assemblymen.
“Such sex discrimination has been a major obstacle for women seeking assembly membership as well as for their activities in assemblies,” said an official from the New Japan Women's Association, a nongovernmental group that conducted the survey from September to December 2014.
The poll was answered by 964 of the nation's 3,826 female assembly members. The group conducted the survey after male legislators in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly were called out for heckling a female member last June. The incident drew international attention to Japan's male-dominated society.
Some of the women polled reported serious harassment, including being touched inappropriately by another assembly member.
Of the respondents, 313 said they felt a sense of discomfort when exposed to acts triggered by widespread gender role perceptions, including remarks like “You are just a mere woman.”
Many sexist remarks and acts were related to pregnancy and childbirth. One 32-year-old member of a city assembly reported they were told by a male colleague that they “should get married quickly and have a baby.”
They were also told by a member of the public that “A little girl like you can't do anything,” the survey said.
According to the survey, 115 respondents reported being targeted by sexual harassment.
A 44-year-old member of a municipal assembly said they were hovered over at a party and touched on their buttocks while being told, “Keep it up.”
Asked for potential improvement measures, 278 respondents cited provision of better education and changes in thinking, followed by 144 who said there was a need to increase the number of female legislators.
Israel to host Federal Government's first 'innovation landing pad' for Australian entrepreneurs
Updated
Israel has become the first pit stop in the Federal Government's mission to create innovation "landing pads" across the world.
Israel's Tel Aviv was touted as the equivalent to Silicon Valley when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Innovation Minister Christopher Pyne announced the international focus of their $1.1 billion "ideas boom" strategy last week.
Israel — which has a population of 8 million — is home to thousands of technology start-ups raising billions in capital.
The small country has the third highest number of companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York and locals have even dubbed the cluster of high-tech companies around Tel Aviv as "Silicon Wadi" — the term in Hebrew and Arabic for valley.
"We in Australia have watched Israel's economy rise from an economy primarily based on agriculture and traditional manufacturing sector to a technologically advanced nation," Mr Pyne told a room full of the CEOs of some of Israel's most promising start-ups, at a lunch in Tel Aviv this week.
"It has been nothing short of meteoric.
"I'm here because our Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said 'Israel is where you have to go.'"
In the Middle East, to promote the creation of a new innovation landing pad Minister Pyne said Australia had a lot to learn from the small nation.
"The potential for Australian companies to take advantage of Israel's knowledge-based, technologically advanced economy is enormous," the Minister said.
Launching Australian start-ups with global help
Minister Pyne said their department allocated $36 million towards creating five landing pads around the world to help Australian tech companies get a foot in foreign markets.
The pads will be a physical space for Australians who are looking to undertake entrepreneurial activity in the overseas location with access to venture capital funds, facilities and contacts — with the first pad to be set up in Tel Aviv.
Israel-Australia Chamber of Commerce executive director Paul Israel told the ABC it was exciting to know Israel was the first landing pad.
"Its a great sign of the relationship between the two countries. With the mining boom now slowing down, Australia has a real challenge now to find new means of growth," they said.
They said Israelis were not scared to take investment risks.
"In start-ups there is a high chance of failure and that cannot be frowned upon by entrepreneurs or funders," Mr Israel said.
"And that is something that Israel is very good at.
"A lot of our guests comment that Israel's attitude toward failure is that it is not the end of the world."
Australia's business environment is 'too conservative'
Australian-Israeli business person Andrew Hamilton works for an Israeli start-up firm called Neotop that is using new modular technology to stop water evaporation from reservoirs and dams.
Last year, their company won the Israeli Prime Minister's award for innovation.
Mr Hamilton said Israel was a more welcoming environment for new start-ups.
"Israel is inspired. Full of energy," they said.
"You can make things happen here.
"Australia is such a conservative business environment."
While Mr Pyne was in Israel, they signed a declaration of collaboration with the country's chief scientist Avi Hasson and also spent 45 minutes with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss security and innovation.
Mr Pyne also met with the Palestinian Authority's Minister for Education and Higher Education Dr Sabri Saidam.
The Palestinian Minister highlighted the biggest innovation challenge for the Palestinians was 3G-phone coverage, as the vast majority of the occupied Palestinian West Bank is still without the service.
Under interim peace agreements, Israeli authorities control cellular networks in the West Bank, but under a new deal signed in November Israel agreed to allow the installation of a 3G cellular network in the occupied territory.
It is not clear when the new measure will go into effect and the agreement will not extend to the Gaza strip.

The suspected kingpin behind the audacious OR Tambo International Airport cash heist has been arrested after posting pictures of themselves with a new R5-million Lamborghini on social media.
The suspect, whose name is known to The Times, was arrested Sunday at their luxury Blue Valley Estate home in Centurion near Pretoria just hours after they posted pictures of themselves and friends on social media with their new wheels.
On March 7 a gang of 13 men made off with an estimated R200-million in foreign currency which was being flown out of the country.
OR Tambo heist: The TimesLIVE story that could have kept suspects out of trouble Bragging and going on a spending spree is the last thing any self-respecting heist kingpin should do.
A week later police arrested four people allegedly linked to the heist, one of whom is a police officer. The latest arrest is believed to have come after police were alerted following suspicions about the purchase of the Lamborghini.
A source close to the police investigation said officers recovered a large amount of cash when they raided the suspect's home.
Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said they could not confirm or deny the arrests.
Airport heist drama twist: 5 cops transferred from OR Tambo Five top police officers are being transferred from OR Tambo International Airport after the spectacular R200-million cash heist there, but their union says they are being targeted for blowing the whistle on corruption and crime.
A second source said the arrest followed the arrest of four other men on Saturday night. They said the first suspect, a 30-year-old security guard with Guardforce, was arrested in Tembisa, on the East Rand.
Guardforce was in charge of escorting the money to SAA flight 294 when it was stolen last week.
The source said the Guardforce guard worked at the vault where the money had been stored shortly before it was transferred to the aircraft.
The second arrest, of a 39-year old security guard, occurred at Elandsfontein shortly afterwards, said the source.
“A Zimbabwean national, who is alleged to have cloned the police vehicles used in the heist, was arrested in Norkem Park. The fifth person arrested is also a guard, who is responsible for perimeter duties at the airport,” the source said. It is not clear who this guard was employed by.
IN MEMES: Twitter rips #ORTamboheist suspect to shreds over Lamborghini purchase Twitter has wasted no time in roasting the suspected kingpin of the multi-million OR Tambo heist, after a selfie with a brand new R5-million Lamborghini led to their arrest.
On Tuesday acting national police boss Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane announced the arrest of the four initial suspects.
Two have already appeared before the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court and face armed robbery charges.
They are expected to appear in court again later this week.
The heist has also resulted in five lieutenant-colonels being transferred from the airport, according to the Sunday Times.
Police are yet to confirm if some of the money has been recovered and are reportedly probing the exact amount stolen, the currency and the intended destination.
Investigations are continuing.
It was barely more than a month ago that Port Adelaide chief executive Keith Thomas presented to their 17 AFL rivals the club's blueprint for reinventing the famous club and its back-to-the-future journey to the Adelaide Oval.
Thomas had been instructed to outline the Power's international search to create a cauldron in its own backyard. Whether the clubs took notice or notes remains unclear but a better way of explaining just how Port Adelaide has captured the sporting imagination of Australians would have been to visit its home ground as it hosted its first AFL final.

Clearly the result was a triumph for the club but it was also a salient lesson for every club outside South Australia. Even the more popular Adelaide Crows have not managed to create such a potent sporting experience.
It would come as no surprise to anyone that the Sydney-Fremantle clash was pale by comparison. The ANZ Stadium's current contract with the AFL does not run out for another two seasons of finals and although the Swans would clearly prefer to play those matches at the SCG that will only happen in the unlikely event of an NRL final clash.
The first thing you notice when you walk into the office of Lever Architecture, in Portland, Oregon, is the smell: fresh, sweet, and vaguely Christmassy. That's because Albina Yard, the year-old building that houses the office, was built out of fragrant Douglas fir. “It's a space people immediately respond to on an emotional level,” says Thomas Robinson [1], Lever's founder and the building's architect.
1 Sam Tenney / Daily Journal of Commerce
Robinson is a pioneer in designing tall buildings that use wood, not concrete or steel, to bear their weight. Albina Yard is only four stories, but it's the prelude to a more ambitious project: Framework [2], a 12-story mixed-use tower that will soon rise in Portland's Pearl District. When it's finished (likely in 2019), it will be the country's tallest human-occupied all-wooden structure.
2 Lever Architecture (Rendering)
Although we've been building with trees since prehistoric times, they are having a moment, architecturally. Wooden structures similar to those in Portland have recently been built in Sweden, Finland, and the U.K., and a 24-story wooden building is under way in Vienna. Architects are even dreaming up wooden skyscrapers, such as a 35-story tower proposed for Paris [3] by Michael Green Architecture, a Canadian firm that designed an eight-story timber office building in British Columbia and a seven-story one in Minneapolis. (Although U.S. building codes generally bar wooden structures more than 85 feet tall, the federal government has recently promoted research into building with wood, hoping to revive the domestic timber industry.)
3 Michael Green Architecture (Rendering)
4 Lever Architecture
There are reasons we originally moved away from building tall with wood, of course, among them fires like the one that devastated Chicago in 1871. The new high-rises aren't made of regular two-by-fours, however. Rather, they use a high-tech wood product known as mass timber. Framework's skeleton [4] will be made of glue-laminated timber—pieces of lumber bonded together into massive beams and columns—while the walls and floors will be made of cross-laminated-timber (CLT) panels, in which layers of wood are stacked in alternating directions. [5]
5 FPInnovations / reThink Wood
Robinson's team put both components through rigorous fire testing. A joined beam, column, and CLT panel were placed in a furnace, then weighed down with 25,000 pounds, to see how strong they would be after exposure to fire and heat. Two hours later, they emerged charred, but structurally intact. Mass timber doesn't ignite easily—it's more like a log than kindling. And the outer char layer that mass timber develops when burned actually insulates the wood.
Another common fear about tall wooden buildings is that in an earthquake, they'd tumble like Jenga blocks. Robinson's team designed Framework's CLT panels to rock back and forth with seismic waves, and subjected the panels to extensive strength testing. [6]
6 Lever Architecture
Mass timber's biggest advantage may be environmental. Buildings are by some estimates responsible for a third of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Much of a building's carbon footprint results from its lifetime energy use, but another big part derives from its construction. The manufacture of concrete and steel accounts for an estimated 10 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions. Trees, however, are “carbon sinks”—they absorb and hold carbon until they decompose or are burned. According to a study in the Journal of Sustainable Forestry, substituting wood for other materials used in buildings and bridges could prevent 14 to 31 percent of global carbon emissions. (This assumes that forests regrow, and that wood is reused or disposed of responsibly at the end of a structure's life.)
7 Lever Architecture
Building this way has local benefits, too. It speeds up construction, because many components are prefabricated—Albina Yard's parts were assembled [7] in five weeks. It uses a resource that can be grown nearby, and it creates local jobs: Most of Framework's mass timber will be sourced locally.
The Northwest has a long history of wooden buildings, stretching back to American Indian plank houses, and Robinson considers Framework a part of this tradition. They also see parallels between wood's revival and the farm-to-table movement. Thirty years ago, they say, we ate without much thought about how our food was grown. Now “people want to know where their food is coming from. And I think that interest is starting to happen in architecture.”
Warming? Why would anyone think the planet is warming?
Not that it comes as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention, but EPA administrator Scott Pruitt removed all doubt Thursday that they are a science-denying ninnyhammer. In an interview on CNBC this morning, Pruitt explained that the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change is actually wrong, because they don't believe it. So there.
EPA boss Pruitt says CO2 isn't primary contributor to global warminghttps://t.co/s9ShXkYBpZ pic.twitter.com/rkboAnR1xv — Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) March 9, 2017
Carbon dioxide? Are people still going on about that? Get over yourselves. Science didn't win a massive landslide in the Electoral College, Donald Trump did, and now it's time to face the alternative facts: CO2 is probably just a lie made up by liberals:
"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see," they told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "But we don't know that yet. ... We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis."
Well golly, he's the head of the EPA, so they must know their stuff, huh? We're frankly astonished that they even allowed the phrase "global warming" to escape their lips, which may get them in trouble with the Heartland Institute unless they issue an immediate clarification that they meant it's probably caused by volcanoes or sunspots or natural climate cycles, or whatever this week's anti-science bullshit might be. We just can't know? How can anyone know anything, after all? Isn't the best option to say you never know anything, so you won't hurt oil and gas profits?
For what it's worth, CNBC at least offers this sort-of correction, though for fuckssakes it's not an "opinion":
Pruitt's view is at odds with the opinion of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere," NASA and NOAA said in January.
We hear most doctors also are of the opinion that germs play some role in the spread of disease, although that's still being studied, so let's not get too far ahead of ourselves and set policy based on that wild speculation.
The EPA's own website on climate change, for now at least, explains quite clearly -- in terms even a Trump cabinet member might be able to understand -- how the release of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels works to trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere. No doubt he'll get right on removing that heresy fairly soon.
Incidentally, if anyone finds a genie in a bottle somewhere, could you maybe use one of your wishes to plunk Scott Pruitt down in a locked room that they can only leave after Neil deGrasse Tyson explains climate science to him, very carefully, perhaps with a copy of the climate episode of Cosmos? It's a thought. They can have snacks and bathroom breaks, even.
Pruitt also insisted that it's perfectly consistent to be both pro-environment and pro-energy, which is true enough until you get into the details of what kinds of energy you're advocating. As for the EPA's 2009 determination that CO2 poses a threat to public health, and is therefore within the agency's regulatory purview -- upheld by the Supreme Court in 2014 -- Pruitt would like to see Congress reconsider that, because if anyone knows how science works, it's Republicans in Congress.
Pruitt explained they think last year's Paris Climate Agreement is "a bad deal" because it allows China and India to delay carbon reductions, although China has already committed to reaching its reduced emissions goals ahead of the 2030 goal in the Paris agreement. And again, they think it was awfully sneaky of President Obama to have set U.S. carbon reduction goals for the Paris accord without giving Congress a chance to gut the plan, because how is that even fair?
Rachel Maddow Would Like To Scare The Shit Out Of You Now What is Russia doing RIGHT NOW to continue its campaign to undermine American democracy? That's what Rachel Maddow wants to know.
CNBC notes the Paris Agreement was negotiated by the State Department, which would be responsible for following up on the commitments made in Paris; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during their confirmation hearing that they think the U.S. should abide by the Paris Agreement, which is somewhat reassuring, at least if we decide to keep at least part of the State Department at all. In reality, Pruitt's EPA will play a large role in setting (read: gutting) emissions standards in compliance with/defiance of the Paris goals.
Following the interview, the Sierra Club issued a statement saying it demonstrated that Pruitt's denial of "the basic established facts of climate science" today contradicted their testimony in their Senate confirmation:
It now appears Pruitt misled Congress, as this anti-science position contradicts what they told the Senate in the questions for the record (Page 122) they submitted during their confirmation process.
The questions are quite detailed, and Pruitt's answer sure sounds like he's at least pretending to accept science is real and that the EPA should regulate CO2 emissions:
Oh, but look at the weasel words, too -- "up to date and objective scientific data" from whom? Perhaps between January 18 and now, their "ever-evolving understanding" of greenhouse gases has evolved to the point that carbon dioxide isn't one anymore. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said Pruitt should lose their job, for which he's clearly not fit:
The arsonist is now in charge of the fire department, and they seem happy to let the climate crisis burn out of control. As Pruitt testified before Congress, it is the legal duty of the EPA to tackle the carbon pollution that fuels the climate crisis, but now they are spewing corporate polluter talking points rather than fulfilling the EPA's mission of protecting our air, our water, and our communities. Pruitt is endangering our families, and any sensible Senator should demand they are removed from their position immediately for misleading Congress and being unfit and unwilling to do the job they have been entrusted to do.
We're certain they'll get right on that, just as soon as the House Science Committee can reach an agreement on the shape of the Earth.

Hi! Steph here, former long-time End Point employee now blogging from afar as a software developer for Pinhole Press. While I'm no longer an employee of End Point, I'm happy to blog and share here.
I recently went down the rabbit hole of figuring out how to cache full HTML pages in memcached and serve those pages via nginx in a Ruby on Rails application, skipping Rails entirely. While troubleshooting this, I could not find much on Google or StackOverflow, except related articles for applying this technique in WordPress.
Here are the steps I went through to get this working:
Replace Page Caching
First, I cloned the page caching gem repository that was taken out of the Rails core on the move from Rails 3 to 4. It writes fully cached pages out to the file system. It can easily be added as a gem to any project, but the decision was made to remove it from the core.
Because of the complexities in cache invalidation across file systems on multiple instances (with load balancing), and the desire to skip a shared/mounted file server, and because the Rails application relies on memcached for standard Rails fragment and view caching throughout the site, the approach was to use memcached for these full HTML pages as well. A small portion of the page (my account and cart info) is modified via JavaScript with information it retrieves from another server.
The following [simplified] changes were made to the actionpack-page_caching gem, to modify where the full page content was stored:
# Cache clearing update: + Rails.cache.delete(path) - File.delete(path) if File.exist?(path) - File.delete(path + '.gz') if File.exist?(path + '.gz')
# Cache write update: + Rails.cache.write(path, content, raw: true) - FileUtils.makedirs(File.dirname(path)) - File.open(path, 'wb+') { |f| f.write(content) } - if gzip - Zlib::GzipWriter.open(path + '.gz', gzip) { |f| f.write(content) } - end
# Cache path change: def page_cache_path(path, extension = nil) + path - page_cache_directory.to_s + page_cache_file(path, extension) end
See, it's not that much! The rest of the gem was not modified much, and the interaction from the Rails app to this gem was maintained (via a controller class method :caches_page). The one thing to note above is the raw option passed in the call to write the cache, which forces the content to be served as a raw string.
Step 2: Set up nginx to look for memcached files
Next, I had to set up nginx to serve the HTML from memcached. This was the tricky part (for me). After much experimentation and logging, I finally settled on the following simplified config:
location / { set $memcached_key $uri; set $memcached_request 1; default_type "text/html"; if $uri ~ "admin") { set $memcached_request 0; } if ($uri ~ "nocache") { set $memcached_request 0; } if ($memcached_request = 1) { memcached_pass localhost:11211; error_page 404 = /nocache/$uri; } }
The desired logic here is to look up the memcached pages for all requests. If there is no memcached page, nginx should fall back to serving the standard Rails page with a modified URL (“/nocache/” prepended). Without this URL modification, nginx would get stuck in an infinite loop of looking up all URLs in memcache repeatedly.
Step 3: Setup a Rack::Rewrite rule to lookup /nocache/ pages.
Due to the infinite loop problem, Rails was receiving all requests with /nocache/ prepended to it. A simple solution to handle this was to add a Rack::Rewrite rule to internally rewrite the URL to ignore the /nocache/ fragment, shown below. The nice thing about this change is that if caching is disabled (e.g. on the development server), this rewrite rule won't affect any requests.
config.middleware.insert_before(Rack::Runtime, Rack::Rewrite) do rewrite %r{/nocache/(.*)}, '/$1' end
Step 4: Cache invalidation: the really hard part, right?
Finally, I had to add cache invalidation throughout the application where the memcache pages needed to expire. There are a few options for this, for example:
Inside a Rails controller after a successful update/commit.
Inside a Rails model, via ActiveRecord callbacks.
Inside a module that decorates an ActiveRecord model via callbacks.
Choose your poison wisely here. A controller makes sense, but in the case where RailsAdmin is utilized for all admin CRUD methods, it's not much different (IMHO) to extend the controllers as it is to extend the models. I'm a fan of ActiveRecord callbacks, so I went with option 2.
Final Thoughts
Logs were invaluable here. Most importantly, the memcached log was invaluable here to confirm the infinite loop bug. Also, the Rails dev log was naturally helpful once I solved the nginx issue to handle the Rack::Rewrite rule.
One important note here is that this type of caching does not take advantage of expiration via model timestamp cache keys introduced in Rails 4. But, it wouldn't be able to, because nginx needs a quick lookup on the URL in memcache to serve the file, and we ideally don't want to hit the database to try to figure out what that key should be.

The Dutch Football Federation has launched an investigation into the ownership structure of Vitesse Arnhem after the former major shareholder alleged Chelsea had exerted undue influence at the Eredivisie club and had even sought to prevent them from qualifying for the Champions League.
The Premier League club and Vitesse enjoy a close relationship, with the Dutch team's owner, Alexander Chigirinsky, a good friend of Roman Abramovich. Chelsea has four players – Bertrand Traoré, Lucas Piazon, Patrick van Aanholt and Christian Atsu – on loan at the GelreDome, with others having spent time there over the first half of this season. The partnership has helped Vitesse to third in the table.
A bitter dispute has recently flared up between the former owner Merab Jordania and Chigirinsky, with the former suggesting Chelsea had not wanted the Dutch club to qualify for Europe's elite competition. Uefa regulations prevent owners from entering two teams in one of its competitions.
Chelsea have dismissed Jordania's allegations and insist Vitesse are an independent club whose qualification for the Champions League would benefit their loanees' development, but declined to comment publicly on the matter. Jordania's assertions, however, have prompted the Dutch federation, KNVB, to ask its member club to detail their "organisational structure" to ensure the integrity of the local competition.
"I want to tell the Vitesse supporters the real story," said Jordania, a former Georgian footballer who saved Vitesse from financial ruin in 2010. "I wanted to reach for the title, but 'London' didn't want that in the end. Ambition is fine, but Vitesse is not allowed to reach the Champions League … I will tell you now why [the manager] Fred Rutten left [last June]. They knew that they aren't allowed to win the title with Vitesse.
"In the winter they brought the team to the top. We had the feeling we needed one more player to win the title, Kelvin Leerdam. The transfer seemed to be a done deal when all of a sudden 'London' intervened. We were not allowed to be too strong. I couldn't explain that to Fred. I had to cover the club and 'London', but it caused a lot of tension and chaos."
Jordania also claimed the sale of Wilfried Bony to Swansea last summer was sanctioned to prevent Vitesse qualifying for the Champions League. "I wanted to keep Bony in Arnhem for six more months," they said. "I was in touch with Michael Laudrup, the Swansea manager at the time. I told them it was better that they took Bony in the winter, for Vitesse to start strong in the season, but Bony had to be sold."
The Vitesse chairperson, Bert Roetert, claimed Jordania's comments read like "a poor 1 April joke".
After unveiling its phone OS last month, Canonical is today launching its new tablet-ready Ubuntu interface. Like the phone experience, Ubuntu for tablets is optimized for touch, relying on edge gestures for navigation — there are no physical buttons required. If you've seen our hands-on with Ubuntu for phones, everything will look fairly familiar: the main interface itself is similar to the phones OS, with the same focus on a universal hub for search, apps, and content, while the notification center utilizes sideways swipes to give you quick access to things like settings, mail, and tweets.
The tablet UI is based on the same OS and code — albeit optimized for ARM and x86 Atom chips — as the regular and phone versions of Ubuntu, which Canonical says enables "true device convergence." That means if you plug your phone or tablet into a TV, you'll have access to either the PC or TV Ubuntu interface and apps. Canonical teases that a PadFone-like device could essentially be all you'll ever need — phone, tablet, media streamer, and PC.
Although it shares most of its code with the desktop Ubuntu, Canonical has added a new multitasking mode for tablets that seems heavily influenced by Windows 8. "Side Stage" lets users run apps in phone mode in a side window, just like Windows' Snap View feature. Tablets will also have voice control through Ubuntu's HUD interface, which it introduced last year. Being Ubuntu, the OS will support multiple users and guest mode, letting you share your tablet with others.
Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview will support the Nexus 4, 7, and 10
Just as with its phone interface, Canonical isn't ready to announce any hardware partners or devices just yet — it's only saying that the tablet experience will be fully integrated with Ubuntu 14.04 next year. The company says its tablet interface will be available on devices ranging from 6 to 20 inches, and has a list of minimum specs on its website. Those include an A15 processor, 2GB of RAM, and a minimum of 8GB of storage. Although the new UI isn't ready for public consumption, Canonical is releasing the Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview for Google's Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets. That's in addition to the Nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus smartphones that are already confirmed developer devices. You'll be able to download it from February 21st on the Ubuntu Developer site.

TORONTO -- The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is "winding down" its gender identity services for children and youth after an external review found its approach was out of step with currently accepted practice.
CAMH made the announcement Tuesday after releasing the report by two independent reviewers, who were tasked early this year with assessing services provided by the Toronto centre's Child Youth and Family Gender Identity Clinic.
The review was sparked by criticisms from the transgender community and others that the CAMH clinic headed by psychologist Dr. Ken Zucker was practising reparative therapy on young people who were questioning their physical gender.
Reparative, or conversion, therapy discourages those who identify as transgender from embracing their non-biological sex. The practice has been deemed unethical by major international medical and human rights organizations.
The reviewers, Dr. Suzanne Zinck of Dalhousie University in Halifax and Dr. Antonio Pignatiello of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, said in their report they were unable to ascertain whether the clinic was in fact practising reparative therapy -- a charge that staff had denied.
But the two psychiatrists said the clinic appeared to operate as a fairly insular entity, with a focus on "intensive assessment and treatment." Current practice in dealing with gender-questioning children and youth favours watchful waiting, while educating and supporting parents to accept a child's gender expression.
Dr. Kwame McKenzie, medical director of CAMH's Child, Youth and Family Program, said services at Canada's largest mental health centre are expected to reflect the latest and best practices in the field.
"We want to apologize for the fact that not all of the practices in our childhood gender identity clinic are in step with the latest thinking," they said.
Zucker, said McKenzie, is "no longer at CAMH," although they would not say when they left their position or whether the psychologist had been fired or resigned.
The director of Rainbow Health Ontario, an organization that works to improve access to services for the LGBTQ community, lauded CAMH for arranging the external review and its response to the findings and recommendations.
"I congratulate CAMH for taking this step, for being public and open about it, for the transparency," said Anna Travers.
Ontario MPP Cheri DiNovo said the CAMH announcement heralds "a new day dawning" for the transgender community.
DiNovo, the NDP's LGBTQ critic, introduced the private member's bill that became the province's Affirming Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Act in June. The act prohibits doctors from using conversion therapy on LGBTQ kids and teens under 18, while delisting it as a covered service for adults under the province's health insurance plan.
"It's always difficult for an institution, especially one the size of CAMH, to be self-critical, so I would just say kudos for being able to be self-critical and for finally keeping up with the times," they said.
"The fact that they admitted that they made mistakes, that that wasn't the way to go and that they're going to be revamping the policies is a very good thing."
Zinck and Pignatiello's report recommended that CAMH engage with the transgender community and key organizations to determine its future direction.
In releasing the external review, CAMH announced it has created a three-pronged plan to update and improve its services.
Besides winding down the clinic -- it will remain open for the time being to provide services for about 20 to 25 current clients -- CAMH plans to consult with community and academic organizations, clients and families to determine what role it should take in gender identity services and how it can best help clients.
"Early next year, we will start to talk to the community about what we should be doing," said McKenzie.
"What sort of supports does people need? Should that be at CAMH? Should that be in the community?
"We're going to work with the community to build something else. Once we know what that something else looks like ... (we'll know) exactly what CAMH's role should be."
Travers agreed there should be some consultation, "but I don't think we necessarily have to locate these services in a psychiatric hospital."
"I think it's time for a new look at how to help families and children. I think it's time for us to look at what people actually need."
For decades, constructing any sort of large-scale affordable housing development on Native American land was nearly impossible. Then California changed the rules—and now, the whole country may follow.
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, the country's largest program for building and preserving affordable rental housing, was virtually inaccessible to California's Native American tribes until a few years ago.
"The way that affordable housing is built most effectively across the United States is by using the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program," said Elizabeth Glynn, CEO of Travois, a consulting firm that facilitates housing and economic development on reservations across the country. "California, unfortunately, has made it nearly impossible to access those credits."
The 9 percent and 4 percent tax credits, which developers sell to private companies, have generally provided a chunk of financing to any income-restricted, multi-unit project that's gone up in the past few decades. In total, about $8 billion in tax credits are dished out each year, over $2 billion of which goes to California.
But from 1986, when the program started, through 2013, not a single one of those credits went towards building housing on any of the state's 100 reservations and rancherias.
Tribes simply could not compete in the application process, Glynn said, which tends to favor developments that are near transit, community resources, and are easier to complete.
"Instead of being able to build a multi-unit apartment building, they have to start by putting in sewer systems, sidewalks, roads," they said.
The lack of building has not been for lack of need, said Cliff Oneill, executive director of the Quechuan Housing Authority on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation in Imperial County.
"Homes here were built 40, 50 years ago," they said. "They're very old and it's a constant job for us to maintain them."
Overcrowding, too, is an issue.
"In some cases, we have 12, 13 people living in one house," they said.
A study commissioned by the California Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2015 found nearly a third of people on tribal lands are living below the poverty line in California. Rates of housing overcrowding are higher than elsewhere in the state. And 8.4 percent of occupied units on tribal land lacked complete plumbing, while 6.5 percent lacked complete kitchens. Both numbers are miles above the rest of the state.
The tribal areas did and do receive some funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Oneill said it's mostly spent on maintaining existing housing.
"We only had sufficient funds to build one, sometimes two homes per year," Oneill said.
Then in 2014, recognizing the need, the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee started issuing a minimum of $1 million of the state's roughly $1 billion in low-income housing tax credits to tribal lands. Since then, at least five developments on tribal lands have been funded, including a 44-unit project on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation.
"It's an excellent source of revenue and it allows us to build quality homes for our members," Oneill said.
Now, legislation making its way through Congress would force all states to consider the needs of tribal lands when allocating low-income housing tax credits. The proposed change is a piece of a larger set of reform bills taking shape as Congress gears up to tackle a potential tax code overhaul. And the proposed changes would benefit low-income renters all over California.
U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) have introduced S 548, which would reform the tax credit as well as expand it by 50 percent over five years. House bill HR 1661, introduced by Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R-OH) and Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), is largely similar, but does not call for expansion.
Affordable housing advocates around the state are keen on seeing the reforms go through.
"We're trying to make sure we can use the credit in a wide range of types of communities," said Emily Cadik, who advocates for affordable housing funding on Capitol Hill for Enterprise Community Partners.
In Los Angeles County, current rules have limited companies' ability to develop affordable housing in many poor neighborhoods. Under current law, developments in census tracts with high poverty rates can receive additional funding to help with construction of community facilities like child care centers. But the number of census tracts that can qualify in any one area is capped, so nearly 1,000 of L.A.'s neighborhoods have met income criteria for the extra investments, but haven't been eligible, said Peter Lawrence, director of policy and government relations for Novogradac & Co., an accounting firm specializing in low-income housing tax credits.
"That can often be the difference between a project penciling out and not," they said.
Los Angeles and Puerto Rico, they said, have the highest number of high-poverty areas that are not been eligible for such funding. The Senate and House bills would both raise the number of census tracts that can get it.
Advocates in rural areas of the state, too, are excited about potential reforms, particularly the Senate bill's proposed expansion of the credit.
"Our housing stock is in high demand, rents are increasing," said Ryan LaRue, who heads development for Rural Communities Housing Development Corporation. Mendocino County, where the firm is located, has one of the highest per-capita homelessness rates in the country.
Affordable housing, they said, is an issue in California, whether it's rural, urban or tribal land.
(CNN) Some 40 personnel from the home base of the military blimp that broke loose Wednesday are now at the site where it landed, a U.S. military official told CNN.
There is an on-scene commander and also an investigating officer for the Pentagon, and they hope to remove the wreckage by the end of the day.
The blimp, associated with NORAD's surveillance of the East Coast, became untethered from its mooring station at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
The blimp is in two major pieces, split between the tail and the rest of the aerostat, according to Army Capt. Matthew Villa.
They said that officials noticed there was still helium in the nose on Thursday morning, so they decided to shoot it with a shot gun, which Pennsylvania State Police did. It was shot after it crash-landed in order to deflate it.
Villa said all options are being considered for how best to remove it. They added that there was no way to tell if the equipment was still functional until investigators have inspected it.

The blimp landed Wednesday afternoon in northeast Pennsylvania, according to NORAD, which described the landing site as "in a rugged, wooded area." The military took no kinetic action to bring it to the ground, according to the Pentagon.
The loose JLENS blimp had been in the air over Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, and caused power outages before it came down, Columbia County Department of Public Safety Director Fred Hunsinger said.
Hunsinger said that there were no reports of injuries or deaths, but the dragging of the blimp's cable had school leaders taking precautions to protect children as classes began to let out for the day.
The dragging cord also caused power outages, with 30,000 people in the Bloomsburg area losing power at one point, according to Joe Nixon with PPL Electric.
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's office said that the state was working with local and federal authorities, including the State Police and National Guard, to secure the aerostat's downed equipment.
"These agencies will continue to be on scene to secure the area and ask all residents to remain away from the scene," the office said in a statement Wednesday.
Raytheon, which produces the JLENS -- short for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System -- describes the system as two aerostats, or tethered airships, that float 10,000 feet in the air. The helium-filled aerostats, each nearly as long as a football field, carry powerful radars that can protect a territory roughly the size of Texas from airborne threats.
NORAD spokesperson Mike Kucharek said that it is not yet clear why the blimp got loose, and that is part of an investigation.

The two blimps, put in the air to better protect the Washington, D.C., area from cruise missiles and other possible air attacks, were launched this winter.
The military official said the JLENS has remote deflation technology, but it may not be working. They provide 360 degrees of defensive radar coverage and can detect and track objects like missiles and manned and unmanned aircraft from up to 340 miles away.
Raytheon said the likelihood that the tether would break was "very small" in a post to its website made before the blimp became unmooored.
"The chance of that happening is very small because the tether is made of Vectran and has withstood storms in excess of 100 knots," the Raytheon post states . "However, in the unlikely event it does happen, there are a number of procedures and systems in place which are designed to bring the aerostat down in a safe manner."
At the time of their launch, the company said the 242-foot-long aerostats would be tethered to the ground by "super-strong" cables. The tethering system was designed to withstand 100 mph winds, according to Raytheon.
The aerostats can stay aloft for up to 30 days at a time
The aerostats carry technology that almost doubles the reach of current ground radar detection, officials connected with the project said at the time of its lauch.
The blimps have no firing capability and don't carry cameras. Any response to missile attacks would still come from ground missiles, ships and airplanes, according to NORAD.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey spoke to reporters at the White House on May 24 after an event on preventing gun violence.
We are proud to stand united in our support for Attorney General Maura Healey as they courageously work to enforce the assault weapons ban.
Maura Healey is not creating new laws.  They are enforcing a law the state legislature put on the books nearly 20 years ago to protect our communities from gun violence. And, as Attorney General, they have that authority and responsibility.
Massachusetts has already seen a decline in assault weapon sales and significant compliance by manufacturers and gun dealers since the announcement. Healey's leadership is making our communities safer.

People high in IU are more likely to compare themselves to others, research shows—another approach tactic. It stands to reason. If you're not sure how successful you are, or how good your relationship is, you might gain clarity by figuring out how you're doing relative to others.
Or, if you're in avoidance mode, you might just ask someone else to tell you the answer. This is a large part of the appeal of advice columns.
“I've thought about this so many times,” Yoffe says. “Why would you reach out by email to a total stranger? ... There's something about the form. You've got to shove it into a paragraph, and I'm answering in a paragraph. We're stripping away the complexities, we're boiling it down. The form requires you to make it as clear as possible so I can give as clear an answer as possible.”
To a degree, almost everyone employs these strategies sometimes. “We all have crutches,” Dugas says. But if someone is “allergic to uncertainty,” as some GAD patients are, they might, for example, become suspicious of their partner much more easily. They might see threats where there are none. “You might ask your spouse four times a day if they still love you, just in case they changed their mind,” Dugas says. “That would be a certainty-seeking behavior.” And a detrimental one.
On the flip side, Dugas says, avoidance taken too far could manifest itself in something like turning down a promotion at work, because you aren't sure what the new job will be like, and you know you can do the one you have now. Grupe points out that avoiding unpredictable situations might rob people of opportunities to disprove their own worries. “With something like a party, you think, ‘I could be embarrassed, people might look at me,' these kinds of worries. If you actually went to that party, you might have disconfirmed these fears, and reduced your anxiety,” they say.
If an aversion to uncertainty starts to negatively affect someone's life like this, it can help to actively practice a third strategy: just living with it.
Dugas and their colleagues have developed a type of cognitive behavioral therapy based on this concept that has proved to be very effective for patients with GAD. Some people are more prone to the approach strategy, some to avoidance, some are a bit of both in different situations. And individuals also differ on what types of uncertainty bother them most. For a business person who can't stop checking the stock market, Dugas says they might have them start checking just once a day, then every other day, and so on. For parents who worry over the uncertainty of their kids' grades, he'd have them slowly back off double-checking homework.
“The goal is always the same,” Dugas says. “To get them to experience uncertainty and learn “this isn't fun, but I can tolerate this.”
Yoffe also advises people to accept life's uncertainties sometimes. They recall a recent Dear Prudie letter from a woman who didn't meet their husband's parents until shortly before they were married, and realized upon seeing them that they looked nothing like their husband. They did, however, resemble their maternal aunt and their husband.

Another year, another Michigan-bound international Smash spectacle. Autumn for the competitive Super Smash Bros. for Wii U scene will soon draw to a close -- and with it comes The Big House 7, the seventh installment of a well-loved tournament series.
From Oct. 6-8, 511 competitors from across the globe will converge at Detroit's Cobo Center, each set on winning one of North America's most coveted titles.
After all, if there's one thing The Big House is known for, it's delivering the best that competitive Smash has to offer. The series has had no shortage of memorable moments, with Gonzalo "ZeRo" Barrios' legendary losers bracket run at The Big House 5 in 2015 still being brought up to this day.
That being said, let's take a look at some of the storylines heading into the weekend.
Momentum
This time last year, Leonardo "MKLeo" Perez wasn't a household name just yet. While the Mexican multi-character prodigy was already recognized as a top-level player, their inability to travel to the United States hindered their prospects back then.
This year? They have all the momentum in the world.
Not only is MKLeo ranked second on the Panda Global Rankings, but he's also coming off a victory over the likes of ZeRo and Evolution Championship Series 2017 winner Saleem "Salem" Young at last weekend's Game Tyrant Expo. Although they did go through a short tilt over the summer, their dominant GT-X performance should be more than enough to prove their recovery.
Don't count the rest out just yet, though. In an esport as dynamic and filled to the brim with top-level talent as Smash Wii U, nothing is set in stone.
ZeRo, The Big House's two-time defending champion, is having yet another stellar season. The pride of Chilean esports is as successful as ever, finishing outside of top two in three out of 17 tournaments since July. MKLeo's win over them at GT-X is in fact one of the two wins they have over ZeRo, leaving the outcome of a potential rematch this weekend up in the air.
Nairoby "Nairo" Quezada, Gavin "Tweek" Dempsey, Larry "Larry Lurr" Holland and Salem, though not as consistent as ZeRo, also pose solid bids for the championship. The quartet have had their share of tournament wins across the season and could very well win the tournament should one be on their A-game.
Expect these names to make or break the bracket in its entirety.
Bridesmaids
James "VoiD" Makekau-Tyson. Ramin "Mr. R" Delshad. Tamim "Mistake" Omary. Rei "Komorikiri" Furukawa. Eric "ESAM" Lew. Jason "ANTi" Bates.
These names should be familiar to any avid Smash Wii U fan with their constant presence in the top cuts of tournaments. As the scene's metaphorical bridesmaids, they've all gotten close to securing a recent stateside championship for themselves -- some more than once -- but fell short in the end.
Each of them has been on the come-up in the weeks leading up to The Big House 7, signs that point to the possibility of a new champion entering the fold. Watch out for Mr. R, given their successful title defense at Syndicate 2017 in their home country of the Netherlands over Japanese titan Kengo "Ken" Suguki.
Redemption
Over the course of the summer, several of the scene's big names fell to the wayside.
The Big House 7 might just be their redemption story.
Fans of Evo 2016 champion Elliot "Ally" Carroza-Oyarce will be hoping for a better performance than the one they gave at GT-X last week, where the Canadian Mario-main placed a mediocre 25th. With rivals like ZeRo and MKLeo present, he'll have to remain steadfast if they are to topple their demons and get back on their toes, a challenge they can definitely overcome.
For a slew of personal reasons like a growing disinterest in the game, recent showings by Samuel "Dabuz" Buzby don't align with their reputation as a "paragon of consistency." Ranked No. 1 in New York, the Rosalina main has faltered these last two months, with a peak of 4th place at DreamHack Montreal. If they can channel the Dabuz that won 2GGC: Civil War however, they may just make the comeback fans have been asking for.
Anyone's game
This doesn't begin to scratch the level of talent present at The Big House 7. Wild cards like Jestise "MVD" Negron and Yuta "Abadango" Kawamura may just shake things up. As with any Smash Wii U tournament, the crown is for anyone's for the taking.
You can watch the tournament begin tomorrow on Twitch.
The law depends on compute power
Jeremy Kun Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 26, 2016
In 2011 Sony sued George Hotz and their friends for jailbreaking the Playstation 3. One of the main complaints was that Hotz published an encryption key online (Sony foolishly broke one of the basic rules of digital signatures).
The case was eventually settled out of court, but the question remains whether it's illegal to publish a specific number on the internet. The law currently seems to agree with Sony, that free speech doesn't cover Hotz's case.
One counterargument is that if a specific number is illegal to publish, then so is anything derived from that number. An excellent example of this is the Free Speech Flag
The colors of this flag, when decoded to hexadecimal, contain the PlayStation3 signing key
Likewise, so-called “illegal numbers” were put on t-shirts, embedded in poems, and amusingly bad YouTube songs.
The illegality of publishing these numbers is probably tightly connected to their relevance. Since the PlayStation3 was superseded by the next generation of video game consoles, I doubt PlayStation would sue anyone for publishing the old keys.
But what about more long-term sensitive numbers, such as social security numbers? On that front the law is much clearer. In California, penal code 1798.85(1) on the confidentiality of social security numbers:
(a) Except as provided in this section, a person or entity may not do any of the following:
(1) Publicly post or publicly display in any manner an individual's social security number. “Publicly post” or “publicly display” means to intentionally communicate or otherwise make available to the general public.
If this applied to the PlayStation key, then publishing the key in plaintext would clearly be illegal. Then later in the same law:
(g) A person or entity may not encode or embed a social security number in or on a card or document, including, but not limited to, using a barcode, chip, magnetic strip, or other technology, in place of removing the social security number, as required by this section.
So this would rule out publishing someone's social security number using a flag, since that is both encoding and embedding the number in a document using “other technology” (or really, a barcode, but other technology captures all computer programs I suppose).
But all of this seems to assume that these rules only apply if the social security number is hard for people in the general public to get access to. The law makes special exceptions for all of these provided that the social security number is securely encrypted.
Of course, what it means for something to be securely encrypted depends heavily on how power current computers are. For example, here's my social security number, encrypted using Keybase. It seems pretty clear that it's not illegal to do that, but now that it's public, you have to wonder whether this will bite me in the ass when I'm 60, computational power has exceeded the security of this particular cryptosystem, and my identity gets stolen.
But it makes you wonder how many SSN-like documents, encrypted using old, broken encryption schemes (or using weak secret keys), are still lying around on the internet. Would it be illegal to decrypt them and publish the results, seeing that anyone with a sufficient skill set could do it?
Or worse, what if I told you that the California Governor's social security number was one of the numbers on this webpage? It contains 10 thousand social security numbers. But if that were actually true, given enough time an average person could conceivably find it. This would be even easier if there were a programmatic method for verifying that a name is tied to a social security number, and I don't doubt that various automated phone/computer systems are weak enough to allow a sufficiently motivated programmer to do this.
So is it illegal for that website to publish these huge lists of SSNs? Is it illegal for me to say that their social security number is on that webpage, if it actually is?
What if I gave you a list of the digits of the Governor's SSN, but not in the correct order? Here they are: 000013488. Is publishing that illegal? It probably doesn't correspond to more than a few hundred valid social security numbers, so you could write a simple computer program to search through them all.
But is that a “public display”? It's not an encoding or an embedding, any more than a big list of all SSNs is. And moreover, SSNs are so short that they almost certainly occur naturally in other contexts. For example, here's a random social security number I took from that list of SSNs: 289-03-0001. If I Google this number (without dashes) I get 500 results. This SSN turns out to be the product number of this Sony bracket, the ID number of this dog walk, and the SKU of this macbook sticker, and more.
So where does the law draw the line?
The only real conclusion I can draw from this is the observation that the law necessarily depends on current computational power, but the law doesn't make that explicit in any document or court opinion I've heard of.
WASHINGTON -- For the second quarter in a row, Americans for Responsible Solutions -- the gun control group led by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) and their husband Mark Kelly -- has raised more money through its super PAC than any other super PAC in the country.
ARS raised $5.84 million between July 1 and Dec. 31, according to FEC filings. That trumps fundraising figures in the same period for the Senate Majority PAC ($5.6 million), the House Majority PAC ($4.4 million), Ready for Hillary ($2.75 million), American Crossroads ($1.7 million) and the Congressional Leadership Fund ($482,000).
"Gabby and I are overwhelmed by the support that we have received from hundreds of thousands of Americans since starting ARS," Kelly said in a statement. "People are obviously fed up with the politics of fear that have dominated the gun violence prevention debate for so long. We are determined to keep fighting for safer gun laws and proud that our supporters will be with us each step of the way."
ARS has raised more than $18.1 million since it launched in January 2013, according to materials provided to HuffPost, which breaks down to 218,733 contributions and an average donation of $82.75. That leaves the organization in good shape heading into the 2014 elections.
Giffords and Kelly have vowed to run ads against senators who voted last year against legislation that would have imposed tighter background checks on gun sales. One lawmaker who opposed the bill is Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a good friend of Giffords and Kelly.
"Yes," Kelly said in April 2013, just before the bill failed in the Senate, when asked if their group would target Flake. "If there was the right candidate out there and if [Flake] didn't support this legislation, yes."
Giffords and Kelly formed ARS two years to the day after Giffords was shot in the head in Tucson, during the January 2011 shooting spree that left six of their constituents dead and 12 others wounded. Their group operates as both a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization and a political action committee. Groups that fall into the 501(c)4 category aren't required to report funds raised.
ARS has raised an impressive haul since its launch, though it's an uphill battle taking on the gun lobby. The National Rifle Association raised $4.7 million in the last six months of 2013, according to FEC records, and that was just through its regular PAC, which allows for a maximum contribution per person of $5,000 per year. Total revenue for the NRA in 2011, the most recent filing available, was $219 million.
Charlie Adam: Involved in Spurs controversy
Tottenham were furious with Adam for their challenge on Paulinho at the weekend, which left the Brazilian with ankle ligament damage and will sideline them for at least a month.
Spurs made an official complaint to a Football Association disciplinary panel, which was rejected - but, on Monday, Sandro tweeted a message to Adam saying 'The Beast', as they are often referred to, was watching him.
Adam had already tweeted themselves saying they had nothing against any Spurs players, but Hughes has responded to Sandro's own message and even hopes the FA take action.
"We don't appreciate some of their players Twittering on their own sites about 'Waiting for Charlie'. I think that has the potential for a disrepute charge in itself, so we'll see if that's responded to," Hughes told The Sentinel.
"I was disappointed it went to a disciplinary panel as the referee (Kevin Friend) was two yards away from it.
"Apparently they said they didn't see it. I was disappointed as the referee should have seen it was a genuine attempt to win the ball."
Hughes insisted that Adam had no issue with Tottenham, given previous controversies they have had with the club.
"Absolutely not," they said. "Why would he? It doesn't make sense.
"But there are a lot of good players who couldn't tackle."
Nelson Mandela admitted to hospital
Updated
Former South African leader Nelson Mandela, 93, was admitted to hospital after doctors advised specialist medical attention for a long-standing abdominal complaint.
"President Jacob Zuma wishes to advise that former president Nelson Mandela was admitted to hospital today, the 25th February 2012," a statement from the presidency said.
"Madiba has had a long-standing abdominal complaint and doctors feel it needs proper specialist medical attention."
The health of the increasingly frail anti-apartheid icon, who is affectionately known as Madiba, sparked national fears after they were hospitalised early last year for an acute respiratory infection.
"We wish them a speedy recovery and assure them of the love and good wishes of all South Africans and people throughout the world," the statement from the presidency said.
"We request that all respect the privacy of Madiba and that of their family during this period."
Presidential spokesperson Mac Maharaj told the private eNews channel that Mandela was admitted on Saturday morning and was doing well.
"I can assure you that the former president is in good spirits and well," they said.
Mr Mandela returned to their Johannesburg home last month from their rural home village in the Eastern Cape. They last appeared in public at the final of the football World Cup hosted by South Africa in July 2010.
They won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, a year before they were elected the country's first black president in South Africa's first all-race vote and served one term before stepping down in 1999.
Rumours over Mr Mandela's health flare up periodically on social networking sites.
The whispers inspire outpourings of grief for the national hero who is regarded locally and abroad as an icon who walked out of an apartheid prison to lead the nation into freedom.
In December, a local television station aired archive footage of their January 2011 hospitalisation which spurred a series of tweets mistakenly announcing new ill health concerns.
The presidency had to issue an assurance of their health to quell the rumours.

On April 18, 1977, President Jimmy Carter announced their new energy policy. Their speech included the following predictions of a dire future unless we repented of our evil ways:
I know that some of you may doubt that we face real energy shortages. The 1973 gasoline lines are gone, and our homes are warm again. But our energy problem is worse tonight than it was in 1973 or a few weeks ago in the dead of winter. It is worse because more waste has occurred, and more time has passed by without our planning for the future. And it will get worse every day until we act. The oil and natural gas we rely on for 75 percent of our energy are running out. In spite of increased effort, domestic production has been dropping steadily at about six percent a year. Imports have doubled in the last five years. Our nation's independence of economic and political action is becoming increasingly constrained. Unless profound changes are made to lower oil consumption, we now believe that early in the 1980s the world will be demanding more oil that it can produce. The world now uses about 60 million barrels of oil a day and demand increases each year about five percent. This means that just to stay even we need the production of a new Texas every year, an Alaskan North Slope every nine months, or a new Saudi Arabia every three years. Obviously, this cannot continue. … Now we have a choice. But if we wait, we will live in fear of embargoes. We could endanger our freedom as a sovereign nation to act in foreign affairs. Within ten years we would not be able to import enough oil — from any country, at any acceptable price. If we wait, and do not act, then our factories will not be able to keep our people on the job with reduced supplies of fuel. Too few of our utilities will have switched to coal, our most abundant energy source. … Inflation will soar, production will go down, people will lose their jobs. Intense competition will build up among nations and among the different regions within our own country. If we fail to act soon, we will face an economic, social and political crisis that will threaten our free institutions. SOURCE Carter's Speech
Their conclusion was that “We must start now to develop the new, unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century.” So they started throwing money at the problem. Their “solution” involved inter alia:
• A “gas-guzzler” tax on automobiles
• A rebate on electric vehicles
• A gasoline tax
• Subsidies to buses
• Taxes on aviation and marine fuel
Sound familiar? It should, as these are all parts of the current war on fossil fuels.
A year and a half from now, it will be the 40th anniversary of President Carter's prophecies of catastrophe. And it will also be the 40th anniversary of the start of the subsidization of the solar and wind power sectors. These subsidies have currently reached astounding levels. Table ES2 from the US Energy Information Agency gives the subsidies of all types (direct expenditures, tax expenditures, R&D, rural utilities subsidy) for 2013, the most recent year available. Here are the results:
In 2013, coal was subsidized about a billion dollars. Natural gas and oil, about $2.3 billion. Nuclear got about $1.7 billion. Total, about $5.0 billion dollars.
Now, how about renewables? Solar energy alone, at $5.3 billion, gets more subsidy than all the fossil fuels put together plus nuclear. And wind energy alone, the recipient of an even larger $5.9 billion dollar subsidy, also is larger than all fossil plus nuclear. In total, the renewable sector got about $15 billion dollars in subsidies, three times that of fossil fuels plus nuclear. More than two-thirds of that went to wind and solar.
And it is getting worse. Despite years of people saying that the solar and wind power were market ready and competitive and all that, in 2010 solar and wind got a total of $6.5 billion dollars in subsidies … and by 2013, the subsidies were up to $11.2 billion dollars.
$11.2
A Billion.
Dollars.
Note that this $11+ billion dollar subsidy was just for 2013, and does not include the billions and billions of the past 36 years of solar and wind subsidies since Jimmy Carter. It also doesn't include the billions upon billions of dollars that the Europeans have poured into solar and wind subsidies of all types. And importantly, it doesn't include the subsidization of expensive renewable energy sources through “renewable energy mandates”. It also only includes US Federal Government programs, so it doesn't include any State programs.
It also doesn't include the implicit subsidy of renewables from the penalties imposed on fossil fuels (Carter's gasoline taxes, “cap-and-trade” programs, the Kyoto Protocol, “carbon taxes”, and the like).
So we're talking a playing field which has been tilted in favor of solar and wind energy by something on the order of at least a hundred billion dollars … how's that going?
Well, yesterday I noticed that the new 2015 BP Statistical Review of World Energy had been released. So I thought I'd investigate the massive progress that the hundreds of billions of dollars of solar and wind subsidies in the US and other countries had bought us. Here's the latest global data, read'em and weep …
Figure 1. Global consumption of all forms of energy (blue line) in millions of tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE). SOURCE: 1.6 Mb Excel workbook
I bring all of this up for three reasons. The first is to show just how little our ~ hundred billion dollars in solar and wind subsidies has bought us. If that was supposed to be our insurance policy, it's not only a failure, it's a cruel joke. It's cruel because that amount of money could provide clean water for everyone on the planet …
The second reason is to highlight the continuing failure of these “We're all DOOOMED!! We're running out of energy!” kind of prophecies. President Carter was neither the first nor the last of these serial failed doomcasters.
The third reason is to highlight the ludicrous nature of the claims that solar and wind are making serious inroads into the global demand for energy. They are not. Solar and wind are a rounding error. Despite almost forty years of subsidies, despite renewable mandates, despite carbon taxes, despite cap-and-trade, despite a hundred billion dollars spent on this Quixotic quest, solar and wind have barely gotten off the floor. Look at that chart, and give me a guess for how long it will take for solar and wind to catch up with fossil fuels.
Then give me a guess how long it would take if we removed all subsidies as we should.
Here's the bottom line. It's not just that solar and wind can't replace fossil fuels.
It's worse than that. Solar and wind can't even keep up with just the increase in fossil fuels … fail. Massive fail.
As far as I'm concerned, giving one more dollar to either solar or wind subsidies is a crime against the taxpayer, as well as against the economy … after almost forty years of fruitless subsidies, they've had their chance and they still don't measure up. Time to stop throwing good money after bad.
Best regards to each of you,
w.

• Thieves steal all but two bikes on eve of race in France • Sky get five from nearby training camp and borrow one more
Team Sky has one of the biggest budgets in cycling but one of their riders is on borrowed equipment at this weekend's Tour du Haut Var after thieves stole 16 bikes on the eve of the race.
Sky's participation in the two-day event was initially thrown into doubt after team mechanics discovered the loss of all but two of the bikes the team had on hand in the south of France. They had been stolen from the support vehicle.
However, with the race start in Le Cannet-des-Maures not too far from their training base in Nice they have been able to get five more bikes to the start and borrowed another from the Bretagne-Séché Environnement Team.
"The thieves took all the bikes, bar two, and we presume they only left those because they'd run out of space in whatever transport they were using," Sky's race coach, Shaun Stephens, told the team's website. "They also took some of the spare training wheels, and various bits of other equipment.
"We're still able to take part in the race though and seven of our eight riders will be riding team-issue Pinarellos. The two that were left in the van are going to be used and we managed to source five others from our training house in Nice, which is about an hour away from where we're staying. The remaining bike we've been able to borrow from the Bretagne-Séché Environnement team, who we've been sharing our hotel with. That was a really nice gesture from them and we appreciate it a lot. Things like that really show the spirit of cycling and we can't thank them enough."
Climber Sebastián Henao will take the borrowed bike on Saturday's sprint stage, while Chris Sutton is expected to be on board on Sunday.
"Racing so close to Nice, it's almost the best of a bad situation, because if it had been anywhere else in the world we'd have been in real trouble and probably not been able to take part," Stephens added. "Fortunately we had a lot of spare equipment there so we should be okay to continue without the need for any further replacements."
With the Tour de France winner, Chris Froome, at the Tour of Oman, and Sir Bradley Wiggins and Richie Porte at the Ruta del Sol in Spain, Sky's squad in France features Ian Boswell, Nathan Earle, and Josh Edmondson.
Just hours after an explosion at a second earthquake-damaged reactor at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant, it is being reported that cooling functions have broken down at a third.
There have been desperate attempts to control the temperature of the reactors since Friday's earthquake and tsunami caused a massive systems failure.
Officials say the possibility of a large-scale radiation leak is “small”.
Japan's Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the second explosion was similar to the first three days ago. The inner structure of the reactor has not been damaged, they added, and confirmed the possibility of a large-scale radioactive leak was low.
In the wake of Friday's disaster, there is now uncertainty over energy supplies.
The national power company is to implement rolling blackouts in Tokyo and surrounding cities to save power.
A semiautomatic rifle that 'sprays like a fire hose' has slipped through legal loopholes even though machine guns are illegal
The SFS BFR 'bump gun' is fed bullets from a belt and can fire thousands of rounds at a time
It will go on sale this autumn for $6,000
The weapon uses the recoil to 'bump' the gun, speeding up the rate of fire
It is technically still a semiautomatic weapon, which means it can be sold to the general public
Newly-manufactured automatic weapons, such as machine guns, are illegal for civilians to buy
A machine gun can normally fire up to 1,000 bullets per minute
A semiautomatic rifle that mimics the rapid fire of a machine gun is about to hit the shelves.
The SFS BFR, made by Texas company, Slide Fire, is fed bullets from a belt, which gives it the potential to have thousands of rounds of ammunition.
The weapon will be available this autumn and will sell for $6,000, according to Brandon Renner, the sales and marketing manager for Slide Fire.
They said the gun ‘sprays like a fire hose'.
‘We recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt, but one person could make it as big as they want.'
Scroll down for video...
Approved: The new bump stock rifle which fires like a machine gun has been deemed as legal by The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
Ready, aim... fire! The rifle fires multiple rounds like a machine gun
Spray like a hose: The bullet casings fly out of the weapon as it's fired
The recoil: The part of the gun that makes it all happen - the new rifle is fitted with this smart piece that allows the gun to shoot multiple bullets at a time
Automatic weapons, such as machine guns, are heavily restricted at a federal level for the general public by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986.
Automatic firearms also include short-barreled shotguns and short-barreled rifles. A machine gun can normally fire between 400 and 1,000 bullets per minute, or between 7 and 17 rounds per second.
But the manufacturers of the SFS, also called a ‘bump gun', found a loophole.
Of the pieces that make up a gun, The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) only regulates the ‘receiver'.
It is the only piece that has a serial number and the only one that requires a background check to purchase.
Slide Fire's technology uses the recoil of the rifle shot to ‘bump' the gun, speeding up the rate of fire without changing the gun's classification as a semiautomatic.
To be classified as a semiautomatic, the gun is only allowed to fire one round each time the trigger is pulled.
Multiple bullets: Just like this machine gun, the bump gun can fire thousands of rounds from a belt
Semiautomatic: A normal assault rifle (pictured) does not have the bump stock 'recoil' part that moves back and forth to fire the bullets faster
In a video advertisement for the gun, the company states that this type of 'slide stock' technology gives people the ability to 'bump fire more safely' offering 'another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere'.
According to the company, the 'muscular application of force to create forward movement of the firearm defines the will of the shooter to discharge each individual round of ammunition.
‘Each discharge requires a separate decision by the operator to move the firearm back to a firing condition,' says the ad.
And so, the gun is technically legal.
In a 2010 letter posted on Slide Fire's website, the ATF wrote: ‘We find that the 'bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms act.'
ATF spokesperson, Christopher Amon, told CNNMoney.com : ‘I can confirm that ATF did approve the device referenced in the letter and that the Slide Fire is legal.'
Slide Fire, based in Moran, Texas, already sells bump-stocks for $370 that speed up the rate of fire for semiautomatics.
The company also sells semiautomatic rifles that have already been accessorised for bump-fire, costing between $1,150 to $1,950.
But these guns use magazines, not belts, and thus have limited ammo capacity.
A spokesperson for Wal-Mart, one of the largest gun sellers in America, said the company does not sell Slide Fire products, and will not be offering the belt-fed rifle.
Machine guns: Automatic assault rifles can fire up to 1,000 rounds a minute just by holding the trigger
Reborn: Slide Fire's new gun has been called 'a poor man's machine gun' by weapons shop owners
James Hill, owner of the Abilene Indoor Gun Range, located about 50 miles away from Slide Fire's headquarters, told CNNMoney.com that the company's bump-fire accessories are quite popular with their customers.
But Hill, who referred to the Slide Fire products as ‘a poor man's machine gun', doesn't plan to sell the belt-fed gun, because they don't believe there will be much of a demand for it.
They said the Slide Fire rifle is a bit more challenging to fire than a fully automatic weapon.
‘It's not as easy [as full auto], but it's fairly idiot proof,' they said.
It has been unlawful since 1934, under The National Firearms Act, for civilians to own machine guns without special permission from the US Treasury Department.
Since the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of May 19, 1986, ownership of newly manufactured machine guns has been prohibited to civilians.
It used to be the young bucks and their T-bones, or the welfare queen with their Cadillac, who were leeching off good, hard-working Real Americans. It turns out Ronald Reagan was modest. On Thursday, in a speech that was such a towering pile of complete horseshit that it may well reach the moon, President* Donald Trump told the country that the rest of the world is now the craftiest welfare queen of them all.
I didn't think they could top their ghastly American Carnage inaugural address for sheer fact-free and paranoiac mendacity, but they managed to do it on Thursday. By announcing that the United States was withdrawing from the groundbreaking Paris Accords regarding the world climate crisis, the president* wallowed in rank, xenophobic victimhood while basking in the scattered applause of the otherwise unemployable yahoos whose self-respect is sufficiently low that they still work for him. Any doubt that Steve Bannon is running this White House now, either personally or through their finger-puppet, obvious anagram Reince Priebus, now has evaporated. The transformation of the American government into a Breitbart comments thread is complete.

It was appalling. It was condescending. It was awful content delivered by a dolt who wouldn't know the Paris Accords from a baguette without the shoddy talking points that someone put in front of him. For example, they read off a fanciful list of "consequences" for adhering to the Paris Accords down through the next decades. Afterwards, Ali Velshi, a welcome addition to the MSNBC cast of regulars, pointed out that the president* was reading from a debunked report that presumed in its analysis that the U.S. would fulfill every one of its agreed-upon conditions while no other participating country would fulfill any of theirs. This is not surprising. The president* would have read a commercial for hair-replacement if someone had put it in front of him.
The least objectionable element of the speech was its utter internal incoherence.
The United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian economic and financial burden the agreement imposes on our country.
Paris was a non-binding and ineffective agreement, but it was "draconian" nonetheless. The economy is booming under their leadership, but the Paris Accord was destroying it at the same time. This was a speech written by a fool, to be delivered by a fool, with the presumption that a great percentage of its target audience is made up of fools.
But the really noxious stuff was the attempt at transforming a worldwide agreement to combat an existential threat to life on this planet into what they stupidly called a scheme to redistribute our wealth to China, as if we're all not going to be buying our solar panels from China for the next 50 years because of this cluck. The really noxious stuff was all that simpering about how the rest of the world is playing us for suckers and laughing at us, as though the rest of the world doesn't think we've lost our mind as a nation simply by electing a vulgar talking yam. The really noxious stuff was all their crocodile tears about the Forgotten People, as though a lot of them are not suffering through drought, or losing their houses to floods and to landslides, about which they and their people care nothing at all.
The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement. They went wild. They were so happy, for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say that the obvious reasons were for economic competitiveness and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is that we continue to suffer from this self-inflicted economic wound.
You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those who want to keep an open mind. At what point does American get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us at a country? We want fair treatment for our citizens, and fair treatment for our taxpayers and we don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more.
It was a speech written by an angry child, to be delivered by an angry child, with the assumption that its targeted audience was made up of angry children, too. And it was of a piece with that lunatic Wall Street Journal op-ed from Tuesday in which H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn pretty much decided that international diplomacy is nothing more than a larger-than-usual barrel of cannibalistic crabs.

Not content to have lined the United States up with the anti-science side of the most pressing global issue of our time, they brought up Scott Pruitt, the head vandal at EPA, after the speech, so that Pruitt could say great things about him, and actually talk about freeing the government from "special interests" without their tongue turning to sand. (Pruitt, you may recall, is the guy who, while Oklahoma's attorney general, literally passed an oil company letter along to the EPA by signing their name to it. They also don't believe that human activity causes the climate crisis.) The idea that these people put together a party in the Rose Garden to celebrate the withdrawal of American leadership in the world leads me to believe that they'd host a barbecue to celebrate a public execution.
None of that matters. While the president was speaking, as it happens, a huge chunk of Antarctica was preparing to break off. Meanwhile, Wednesday was the first day of hurricane season, and this president*, who cares so much about the duties of their office and the people of this great land, still hasn't bothered to appoint a FEMA director yet. The nonsense they spewed on Thursday doesn't matter, either, even if it continues to gull the suckers out in the sticks. The oceans are not listening to him.

Mountain Lion, the latest version of Apple's OS X desktop operating system, went public Wednesday to the delight of Mac users everywhere. But while the world fawns over updates to Safari and a number of features cribbed from iOS, most people are skipping over perhaps the most significant update of all: AirPlay Mirroring.

Deep Inside Mountain Lion: 15 Hidden Features in Apple's New OS
OS Cats: Meet the Real Mountain LionDon't look now, but Apple just created a formidable cord-cutting platform. The new operating system can change the way we watch video in the living room, and might even compel some users to finally cancel their cable and satellite services. Any video content that's available for the computer can now be just as easily watched on an HDTV. All you need is a 2011 or newer Mac running Mountain Lion, and a $100 Apple TV.
The new AirPlay mirroring feature should have the Xfinitys and DirecTVs of the world very concerned.
>While mobile devices are locked into easily controlled ecosystems, and are reliant on apps for content delivery, the PC is the last platform that Hollywood can't effectively touch.‪
‬AirPlay Mirroring in Mountain Lion uses the same basic tech found in iOS devices: Your computer wirelessly transmits whatever is playing on your Mac desktop to your Apple TV, which then shoots this mirrored content to your HDTV via an HDMI cable. Display settings are automatically determined by your Mac, so you don't have to adjust the resolution over and over again, hoping to find the perfect recipe for optimal TV watching.
Once your mirroring set-up is complete, anything you might play on your desktop can be displayed on your big-screen TV – and this is where all that unique, cord-cutting potential comes into play. Sure, you can start playing computer games on the big-screen. And you can also pipe Rdio tunes, or any other music, directly to your TV speakers. But most importantly, you can mirror all those free, streaming desktop services that would otherwise cost money (or not work at all) if streamed directly to a TV.
For example: Hulu's free, PC-only streaming library is suddenly available on your TV without Hulu's $8 monthly tax in the form of a Hulu Plus subscription (this tax is imposed on set-top devices like the Xbox 360 and Sony Playstation). And then there's CBS.com. On the network's website, you can watch (and now AirPlay mirror) tons of network TV shows. Yes, these shows also appear in the CBS iOS app, but the app doesn't support AirPlay mirroring. The same holds true for ABC content: It can be mirrored via ABC.com, but not via ABC's iOS app.
How long will all this streaming desktop content remain free and unfettered? Only time will tell, but the latest evolutions in desktop mirroring could have long-term effects on the delicate relationships between Hollywood content producers, cable and satellite companies, and technology companies like Apple. Currently, desktop computers are somewhat of a bastion for free, streaming content, as evidenced by the Hulu, CBS and ABC policies above. Restrictions are tighter on mobile devices, and this even extends to YouTube, which disables mobile viewing – but not desktop viewing – for user videos that contain copyrighted music content.
But now easy, simple desktop mirroring presents game-changing opportunities for savvy users. Gartner analyst Michael McGuire told Wired, "[Video mirroring] is the longer-term threat. It's the kind of thing the MVPDs [Multichannel Video Programming Distributors], the Comcasts of the world, dread."
Indeed, cable and satellite providers should be filled with dread. While mobile devices are locked into easily controlled ecosystems, and are reliant on apps for content delivery, the PC is the last platform that Hollywood can't effectively touch. Think about it: While the iPhone requires video be encoded as MPEG-4, a Mac (or Windows machine) can play most any video file type available. And with Mountain Lion and an Apple TV, it can shoot this content to a big-screen TV completely wirelessly.
While the ability to attach a computer to a TV is nothing new, it's usually involved physically attaching a bulky computer to a TV's VGA or HDMI port – something the average consumer won't do, if only because it puts the computer in an inaccessible position for general, keyboard-controlled computing. But AirPlay's wireless data-flow is incredibly easy to set up and use. "Sending video to AirPlay is a no-brainer that will appeal to a lot of people," McGuire said.
So is the Mountain Lion/Apple TV combo really the killer platform that will invade the living rooms of the nation? For now, probably not. It's a killer cord-cutting platform, but we think it will remain a tool for only hardcore tech enthusiasts for the immediate future. While Apple is quick to boast that it sold 4 million Apple TVs so far in this fiscal year, the Apple TV is still a hobby for the company. Plus, while Apple computers have a larger market share than they did 10 years ago, Windows is still the dominant desktop platform. And, of course, in order to use AirPlay Mirroring, any Mac needs to have Mountain Lion installed.
That said, where Apple innovates, the industry follows. AirPlay for Mountain Lion is a great method for beaming any desktop content straight to your HDTV, and this includes streaming video from web pages, computer games, and, yes, even illegal videos collected from BitTorrent. And if the greater tech industry takes more bold steps toward changing how video is delivered, the future is going to be rough for cable and satellite providers. Something has to give.
Social media and the blogosphere got a little frenzied after a report surfaced yesterday pointing out Donald Trump gave Texas Governor Greg Abbott a $35K donation to their campaign after the state ended its investigation into Trump University. TWC News certainly made it look really bad for Abbott:
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott received a $35,000 donation to their successful gubernatorial campaign from Donald Trump. This after a Texas probe into Trump University was dropped in 2010, according to the Associated Press.
The AP reported that Abbott, a Republican, was serving as Texas Attorney General at the time, and opened a civil investigation of “possibly deceptive trade practices” into Trump University, but quietly dropped it when the organization agreed to end its operations in Texas. Trump subsequently donated $35,000 to Abbott's successful gubernatorial campaign, according to records obtained by the AP.
A former employee of Abbott's also expressed their belief Trump's donation ended the investigation. Via The Dallas Morning News:
“The decision not to sue them was political,” John Owens told The Dallas Morning News.“Had [Trump] not been involved in politics to the extent they were at the time, we would have gotten approval. Had they been just some other scam artist, we would have sued him.”
On the surface, this reeks of cronyism. It appears Trump is paying back Abbott for not trying to put Trump U out of business. It seems to be a lot like the $25K Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi got in 2013 for not going after Trump U. Even I thought it was, especially after Abbott's Office gave a rather terse reply to questions about the situation (the statement can be forgiven because Texas is mostly underwater right now). It seems extremely out of character for a governor who has made ethics reform a big deal and recently told state agencies to stop using “leave” as a form of severance pay.
Turns out, Abbott's reputation may not be a sullied as it seems. Austin American-Statesman has a pretty good round up of what happened in 2010 between Trump U and Texas (emphasis mine):
The six-month investigation by the attorney general's office, from January to June 2010, into whether Trump U violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, is detailed in documents that a Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, received through a public records request. American Bridge provided the documents to USA Today, which first published a story Thursday on the investigation. The American-Statesman subsequently obtained the documents. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, agreed to suspend Trump U's workshops in Texas, and they never resumed in the state… Trump contributed $25,000 to Abbott in 2013 and an additional $10,000 in 2014, though they didn't contribute to Abbott's re-election campaign for attorney general in 2010, when the investigation was happening.
The timeline is really important here. The Bondi donation came a few months after the Trump U investigation ended, while the Abbott donations came three years after Trump U left Texas. Trump didn't really start getting involved in national politics until 2011 (his first video actually suggested the U.S. get involved in Syria), even though he'd obviously considered presidential runs in 1988 and 2000. So the 2013 and 2014 donations to Abbott appear to more be along the lines of, “Oh, you're a Republican running for office? Here, enjoy.” That's what David Saleh Rauf from San Antonio Express-News believes:
@EricaGrieder @jefffreyspies Consider: Abbott raised more than $45M for '14 race. $10K & $25K small contribs from a big baller like Trump. — David Saleh Rauf (@davidSrauf) June 2, 2016
Another valid point on the issue comes from Texas Monthly senior editor Erica Grieder:
@davidSrauf @jefffreyspies Plus, Abbott endorsed Cruz & clearly thinks Trump is a moron…the contrib seems like a classic Dumb Donald Deal — EricaGrieder (@EricaGrieder) June 2, 2016
Bondi endorsed Trump in March, over Marco Rubio. Abbott didn't even mention Trump at the Texas GOP Convention, even though he's said in the past he'd vote for Trump if they were the nominee. Not only that, but a former Texas deputy attorney general also released a statement on Friday saying it was their decision to not go after Trump U, and they made it without talking to Abbott. Here's part of David Morales' statement via The Dallas Morning News:
During that investigation and following subsequent demands for documents, Trump University agreed to temporarily suspended its Texas operations. By May 2010, Trump University had agreed to permanently suspend of all operations in Texas. That agreement to permanently and immediately leave Texas was, in my opinion, the most important element of resolving this investigation. It ensured that no further Texas citizens would be exposed to the company and it did not preclude those consumers who felt they wanted a refund to demand it from Trump University or in court. At that time, I recall that the Office of the Attorney General had no written complaints from any of the consumers who participated in Trump University. The articles published on June 2 concerning this investigation contain conjecture as to who may have been involved in the decision on this matter. To be clear, I did not discuss this matter with General Abbott or Daniel Hodge (who was incorrectly referenced as “second-in-command” at the time) prior to making my decision. Any suggestion otherwise is false. After the fact, I would have informed the Attorney General and First Assistant Attorney General Andrew Weber as a matter of course regarding this decision, along with dozens of others I would have made that week. I am proud that our Consumer Protection Division was able to get Trump University to immediately and permanently leave the State of Texas. Their good work served our Texas consumers well.
So this really doesn't appear to be a case of cronyism (not yet at least). What this appears to be a case of is the Associated Press, TWC News, and other outlets trying to paint a picture of Abbott being on Trump's payroll, when that may not be true at all. It certainly could end up being true (because all politicians are human and, thus, fallible), but the stench of cronyism isn't as strong as it was when details of the story first came out.
In what's becoming a sadly regular occurrence, gaming company Electronic Arts has announced a new round of layoffs. The company confirmed in a statement that it was laying off employees in an unknown number of locations, saying that the move was part of "hard but essential changes" for the company's future. Though it declined to state how many people were cut, sources have told Kotaku that the layoffs affect up to 10 percent of the workforce. EA listed around 9,000 employees in its last financial statement. Game Informer has also reported that EA is considering shutting down its Partners program, which has helped publish Crysis, Bulletstorm, and other non-EA games.
EA was voted the "worst company in America" after an extremely rocky SimCity launch, prompting COO Peter Moore to apologize and say that the company would "do better." Before the vote, CEO John Riccitiello also announced that they would be stepping down, possibly because EA had missed its financial guidance and internal goals for the quarter. But these layoffs have been going on for much longer than the current publicity problems. In 2012, BioWare suffered multiple rounds of cuts, and its San Francisco office was shut down in 2013. PopCap, which makes Plants vs. Zombies, also had its Dublin studio closed last year, with about 100 people laid off. The past few months have also seen EA's offices in San Francisco and Montreal hit with layoffs, including a round earlier this April.
With each round, EA has emphasized that it's cutting people in order to streamline its operation or move to a new generation of devices, but some of its projects also clearly haven't paid off. Earlier this month, it shut down The Sims Social and other Facebook games, bluntly saying that it had seen user activity drop off sharply. Unlike the layoffs, the Partners shutdown hasn't been confirmed by EA, but a source at Kotaku has echoed it — and given how quickly EA has been shuttering studios, it's well within the realm of possibility.
Update: Polygon's sources have given a better idea of the scope of the layoffs, saying that "hundreds" of people were affected across virtually all parts of the company. Two sources have said that the Partners program is being shut down, and employees from both PopCap Vancouver and Quicklime Games — which worked on Need for Speed — have tweeted that their studios were shut down.
Update 2: Kotaku obtained a leaked memo from EA CEO Larry Probst, which confirms a "streamlining" of the organization, but doesn't comment specifically on affected employees, studios, or the EA Partners group. However, it does suggest that studios have indeed been closed: "This process has led to some difficult decisions about the number of people and locations needed to achieve our goals." Read the whole memo below.
French President Francois Hollande faced their first serious public backlash after up to 50,000 lined the streets of Paris on Sunday (30 September) in protest against their €37 billion austerity budget.
Organisers of the event, which brought together around 60 left-wing groups, claimed that 50,000 protestors took to the streets to denounce the cuts programme.
"Today is the day the French people launch a movement against the politics of austerity," said the Front de Gauche president, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished fourth in the Presidential elections.
On Tuesday (2 October) deputies in the National Assembly will debate the fiscal compact, with a number of members from the ruling Socialist and Green parties expected to defy the government's majority.
French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault accused the protesters of jeopardising the French economy and the stability of the euro. Opposing the fiscal compact would “risk aggravating the crisis”, they said, adding that “the ambiguity of saying 'non' is also something that could lead to the end of the euro."
The protest came days after President Hollande unveiled a package of spending cuts and tax hikes to plug a €37 billion hole in the country's public finances. The package is supposed to reduce France's budget deficit to 3 percent in 2013 from 4.5 percent this year, bringing in €30 billion for the treasury.
As expected, the budget included a new 75 percent top tax rate on those earning over €1 million per year, which opponents claim will see thousands of France's richest people move to the UK and elsewhere for tax purposes. Hollande's budget has also shied away from making any cuts to government jobs.
The budget includes €25 billion of cuts in government spending alongside a further €20 billion in extra taxes levied on businesses and the rich.
Statistics revealed last week that France's national debt to GDP ratio had risen to 91 percent of GDP, a level described as “critical” by Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, and which is far higher than the 60% threshold in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. The country also lost its coveted AAA credit rating in January.
During their election campaign, Hollande had promised to re-open talks on the fiscal compact treaty devised by former President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The treaty, which was agreed at a summit in December 2011, foresees a balanced budget rule for national constitutions.
However, Hollande is now expected to focus on securing a detailed EU growth and jobs plan, including front-loading the use of EU structural funds, project bonds and a youth guarantee scheme.
Frustration of the season boiling over, or just a really silly complaint? It's only one of those two when it comes to Marlins manager Don Mattingly and their complaint after Friday's game against the Dodgers (LAD 7, MIA 2), the team they previously managed.
Let's set the scene.
The Marlins are in the running for the worst record in baseball. They entered Friday with four straight losses and had lost 18 of their last 22.
With a 5-0 Dodgers lead in the bottom of the seventh, Corey Seager swung at a 3-0 pitch, fouling it off. That might not have seemed to matter much at the time, but file it away.
After a Cody Bellinger home run in the bottom of the eighth made it 7-0 Dodgers, Marlins reliever A.J. Ramos hit Brett Eibner with the next pitch.
Leading off the top of the ninth for the Marlins was Giancarlo Stanton. Ross Stripling's first pitch sailed behind Stanton. Benches cleared, but eventually order was restored without much of a fight.
Now that we've got all that, let's hear what Mattingly had to say:
They mentioned the 3-0 swing four times. Four!
This is intense competition. Players, coaches and managers get upset about perceived slights all the time. As mentioned, the Marlins are going through an incredibly rough patch of baseball right now. I say this to point out that I'm not necessarily blaming Mattingly, personally, as much as the collective baseball mindset here. Because ...
For the love of all that is holy, are we really getting worked up about a 3-0 swing in professional baseball?
There's no reason to say something like "these unwritten rules are getting out of control," because they've always been out of control. It's all kinds of dumb to get mad about whether or not a player swings on a certain count. This is professional baseball, not Little League.
Get it together, guys. You're adults being paid handsomely to play/manage a game. A modicum of mental toughness is required. Use it.
Nvidia is riding high on chips for games and artificial intelligence, but it also got a nice one-time boost from the launch of the Nintendo Switch video game console.
Nvidia's Tegra processor serves as the brains of the Switch, which Nintendo launched in March. The Switch works both on the TV or as a portable device, and the power-efficient Tegra helps make that dual-play capability possible.
In the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, Nvidia reported Tegra processor revenue of $332 million, up 108 percent from a year ago and up 29 percent from the previous quarter. The Tegra revenue also included record automotive processor revenue of $140 million, mainly from infotainment modules. The automotive revenue was up 24 percent from a year earlier and up 9 percent from the previous quarter.
Overall, Nvidia beat analysts expectations, reporting 85 cents a share on revenue of $1.94 billion. Analysts expected Nvidia to earn 66 cents a share on revenue of $1.91 billion. Earnings per share were up 85 percent from a year ago, and revenues were up 126 percent.
“The AI revolution is moving fast and continuing to accelerate,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in a statement. “Nvidia's (graphics processing unit) GPU deep learning platform is the instrument of choice for researchers, internet giants and startups as they invent the future.
“Our Datacenter GPU computing business nearly tripled from last year, as more of the world's computer scientists engage deep learning. One industry after another is awakening to the power of GPU deep learning and AI, the most important technology force of our time,” they said.
In a post today, Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg made their first public statement on a recent ProPublica investigation of ad-targeting to hate groups, calling the issue “a fail on our part.” Last week, ProPublica's investigation found that Facebook clients could target ads using keywords like “jew hater” and “Hitler did nothing wrong.”
Sandberg claims the ad-targeting was the result of manual entries in the education and employer fields. (In simple terms, someone listed their job as “jew hater.”) That explanation contradicts the initial ProPublica article, which claimed the categories were algorithmically generated.
“We never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way – and that is on us,” Sandberg wrote. “And we did not find it ourselves – and that is also on us.”
“We never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way.”
Sandberg laid out three changes in how the company targets ads, although each is largely an extension of existing efforts. After restricting self-reported fields for education and profession, Facebook will now restore approximately 5,000 of the most popular responses, all of which have now been reviewed to ensure they don't violate company standards. The company will also devote more resources to ensuring that “content that goes against our community standards cannot be used to target ads,” and add more human oversight to its advertising system more broadly.
The company is also exploring new ways to encourage users to report offensive ads, although it's unclear how those systems will improve on what is currently available. Users can already report advertising content as offensive, using the same mechanism they would for any content on Facebook. More importantly, the ProPublica investigation focused on offensive targeting rather than offensive content, and full information about how a given ad was targeted is not always immediately accessible.
In the same post, Sandberg defended the social value of ad-targeting more broadly. “A local restaurant can shoot video of their food prep with just a phone and have an ad up and running within minutes,” Sandberg wrote, “and pay only the amount needed to show it to real potential customers.”
Facebook's ad targeting practices have come under scrutiny after news that Kremlin-linked groups spent as much as $100,000 on Facebook promotion in advance of the 2016 election. The Daily Beast has also reported that Putin-linked groups also organized 17 separate pro-Trump rallies on Facebook, a potential violation of campaign finance law. Earlier today, members of Congress sent a letter to the Federal Election Committee asking for more transparency into political ad spending on the network. “There is no reason to believe this behavior will stop in future elections,” the members wrote.
At the same time, Facebook's ad moderation has typically been too lax to spot foreign interference at work. A Verge report this week found that the company often asks ad reviewers to examine components of ads individually, with over a thousand components to be scanned in a single day. Under those circumstances, connecting the content, targeting and buyer itself to deduce foreign interference would be almost impossible.
“I know exactly what these guys did,” one former ad-review worker said about the Russian buys. “It's not hard to do.”
Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk, was born in December of 1476 and was only a toddler when their father, John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk, died on 14 January 1476, leaving them an immensely wealthy heiress. Them mother, Lady Elizabeth Talbot, would be able to have very little say in how their daughter's inheritance or marriage … which would be coming sooner than people were expecting, even for the 15th century.
(I have no idea who this little girl is, but they are adorable. Little kids in this era were adorable and vulnerable, too – just like modern children. Let's keep that in mind.)
Although wee Anne would be inherent a vast amount of wealth and land, they aren't supposed to inherit the title. That was for men and male descendants, unless the crown made an exception. In this case, the king made an exception, and not just because their aunt, Lady Eleanor Talbot, was one of King Edward IV‘s side pieces. It was also because there weren't really any male heirs from male dukes to take the title.
The Mowbray men had been passing the title down to one surviving male heir since Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who had died almost 100 years before, in 1399. Anne's great-grandfather, John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, had three sisters, but their grandfather, John de Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, had been and only child who also had one surviving child. The closest male relatives Anne had been 3rd cousins John, Lord Howard and William, Viscount Berkeley and, descendants of the 2nd duke's sisters, Margaret (who married Sir Robert Howard of Tendring) and Isabel (who had children with their second husband, James Berkeley). Of the two, John Howard had the best claim to the title, but it was thin as small beer.
All that John Howard could do was wait and hope something happened to Anne, or try to marry them to one of their grandsons, preferably the eldest, Thomas, who had been born in 1473 and was only 3 years older than Anne. They certainly had good reason to think he's being rewarded with Anne for their grandson, even if the king kept them as a royal ward. Howard was a York loyalist, and had been personally knighted by King Edward IV at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. They served in the king's household, eventually becoming Treasurer, and was made Lord Howard by decree on 15 October 1470 and was admitted to the Order of the Garter on 24 April 1472. Now, all King edward had to do was marry Anne off to the youngest Thomas Howard and make John's grandson Duke of Norfolk jure uxoris.
King Edward IV wasn't going to let a match like Anne de Mowbray go so easily, though. Instead of waiting until they were older and passing them along to Thomas Howard, the king married the 5 year old Anne to their 4 year old son, Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, on 15 January 1478. The king's son would get the magnificent dowry, not John Howard's grandson.
This was a bit of a shock and a bit of a scandal. The church didn't condone marriage that young, although it would tolerate precontracts and engagements, provided the child bride wasn't wed until they were closer to 12 years old. King Edward wasn't risking a wait, however. If Anne died before they were wed to Richard of Shrewsbury, their cousins were their legal heirs. The king was going to get as much material security for their second son as they possibly could, and wasn't going to risk Anne passing away before they could make them a daughter-in-law.
John Howard may have forgiven the king the marriage – it was a dog eat dog world in the Middle Ages after all – but then Anne, Duchess of York, died around 19 November 1481, shortly before their ninth birthday. Them eight year old husband would inherit their lands and money, naturally. That was bad enough, since John Howard should have been the principle beneficiary. However, King Edward made it worse by pushing through an Act of Parliment in January 1483 making Richard Duke of Norfolk as well as York, which would revert to the descendants of their father, King Edward IV, if the young duke died without heirs.
John Howard was cut out completely. The riches of Norfolk would now remain firmly in the hands of the crown. This seems to have stuck in Howard's craw, because when King Edward IV died and their son, King Edward V, came to the throne, Howard was one of the first men to help the new king's uncle usurp their throne and become King Richard III.
With Anne's widowed husband bastardised, John Howard became the new Duke of Norfolk on 28 June 1483. King Richard also made the new duke the Lord High Steward, as well as Earl Marshal, and Lord Admiral of all England, Ireland, and Aquitaine. At King Richard III's coronation, Howard carried the crown, while their eldest son, now the Earl of Surrey, held the Sword of State. Shortly thereafter, Richard of Shrewsbury and their elder brother would disappear, removing all possible contention for Norfolk's dukedom.
John Howard was shot in the face with an arrow and died in the service of King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Although Howard's titles were declared forfeit after their death by the victorious new Tudor monarch, King Henry VII, the former duke's son, Thomas, was given opportunities to prove their loyalty to the new king, and was restored to the earldom of Surrey in May of 1489.
Thomas Howard was loyal to King Henry VIII as well, most notably fighting for the crown against King James IV of Scotland at the Battle of Flodden. As a reward for their decades of service and the valor of their family at Flodden, Thomas Howard was restored as the 2nd Duke of Norfolk on 1 February 1514. Henry VIII would one day marry two of Thomas Howard's granddaughters, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard.
It is weird to think of how the great-great grandfather and great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth I fought against their grandfather in the Battle of Bosworth.
Every major handset has one, so why not the handheld gaming consoles, right? According to a report on Develop, the suits at Nintendo are thinking of making the DSi Shop a bit more than it is right now. Reportedly, bigwigs from the Big N who met up at a company developer conference in London discussed "an exciting and major new app strategy for the DSi," with one source noting that the firm was keen on having devs "offer all kinds of software once the DSi store fully launches in Europe and America." It makes sense to have downloadable short-form titles available; after all, the DSi has an inbuilt camera and microphone, making it perfect for downloading "DSi Ware-like" apps. We'll be keeping a close eye on Iwata's Game Developers Conference keynotes for more insight, but 'til then, we're filing this one in the "we want to believe" folder.[Via GameDaily
The San Francisco 49ers made a bold decision this week in hiring Chip Kelly to be the head coach for 2016 and beyond. The move could blow up in their face, or it could lead to playoff glory. There is a long spectrum of potential outcomes, and I don't think anybody can do more than wildly predict how this whole thing will end.
As interesting as the Kelly addition is for the on-field product, a big question also surrounds general manager Trent Baalke. Jed York made it clear Baalke is on the hot seat. Given that everybody else has been fired, the only guy left to really take the fall if things go south is Baalke. I suppose Mama and Papa York could decide Jed isn't suited for CEO work, but with the new stadium in place, I just don't see that happening. Nope, Trent Baalke is firmly on the chopping block, with 2016 being a huge year for their long-term status.
There are various reports suggesting that Tom Gamble was a big reason Chip Kelly is with the 49ers. They and Kelly are reportedly friends, and it makes sense that Kelly would push to have Baalke and York bring them on board. And considering the questions about Chip's personality, Gamble provides a buffer between Kelly and Baalke/York.
However, Gamble could very well be more than a buffer in the bigger picture. If this season turns out poorly, I don't see Chip's $6 million per year contract going anywhere. If the 2014 and 2015 draft picks do not show further development, Trent Baalke would seemingly be the next guy out the door. Of course, given that Baalke has maneuvered dangerous waters so well in recent years, maybe Gamble ends up as the fall guy if things go south.
None of this is to say it will go south quickly. Like I said, I have no idea what to make of how this all ends up. That's what makes it so fascinating. I realize some people are convinced this will end badly, but I'm at least willing to wait and see what 2016 brings. We'll see if Trent Baalke survives the year. I've attached a poll to see what people think. I realize they could be fired midway through a season, but let's keep it simple with the options.
You see, the thing about being gluten free is that sometimes you just want a damn sandwich. So I made one. A classic BLT…on a potato. I ditched the bread and stacked bacon, lettuce and tomato between two slices of roasted potato. Yes. Yes I did. You should too. I went ahead and added avocado because when has that ever been a bad idea? And you know I don't do mayo, so I whipped up a yogurt-based sauce that ended up being the perfect addition. Yogurt, Dijon and parsley. That's it. No need for mayo. Trust me here. I'm off to the beach, this beach, for a much-needed vacation, but I felt like I needed to share these before I left. They're that good. It couldn't wait. So enjoy your weekend doing whatever you have planned but if I could make one suggestion, make yourself this damn sandwich. Gluten Free BLTs (makes about 8) Ingredients: For the BLT and potatoes: 2 russet potatoes (with a round cross-section) extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper 1- 12 oz package of bacon 1 head lettuce ( I used Bibb lettuce) 2 vine-ripe tomatoes, sliced 1 avocado, sliced For the yogurt sauce: 5.3 oz greek yogurt (1 individual sized yogurt. I used 0%) 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley Salt and pepper, to taste Directions:
Notes:
Empires are continually confronted with the prospect of rebellions: that is one of the occupational hazards of imperialism. The Romans had to contend with those contentious Judeans, whose revolt arguably gave rise to one of the word's great religions. The British lost control of their American colonies to a motley crew of libertarians. And now the Americans, in turn, are struggling with … well, something quite different.
The historical pattern follows the old Roman/British tradition: the imperial power launches a campaign to acquire territory, it conquers its enemies, and occupies the vanquished nation(s). The goal is not only to take new lands and spread the authority of the State beyond its traditional boundaries, but also to extract wealth from the defeated in the form of taxes, raw goods, and markets closed to competitors.
In the case of the American Empire, however, things have been turned on their heads, and nothing dramatizes this bizarre inversion more than the conflict now playing out between the US and, principally, Germany over the future of the NATO alliance.
When President Donald Trump, on their first overseas tour, lectured the assembled NATO-crats on their failure to pay their “fair share” of the alliance's costs, the looks on their faces were a study in contemptuous annoyance. When they failed to reassert Washington's commitment to Article Five of the NATO treaty, it was as if the Pope had refuted the divinity of Christ. The failure to reach accord on trade and “climate change” exacerbated the split in the Western alliance, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quick to respond.
“Speaking in a packed beer tent in Munich on Sunday, after a Group of Seven summits in Sicily and a NATO meeting in Brussels – both dominated by tensions with Trump – Merkel spoke with surprising frankness.
"'The times when we could fully count on others are over to a certain extent. I have experienced this in the last few days,' Merkel said.
"'We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands, of course in friendship with the United States, in friendship with Great Britain, with other neighbors wherever possible, also with Russia,' they continued.
"'But we must know that we need to fight for our future ourselves, as Europeans, for our destiny.'"
Merkel's contention that the US – and, secondarily, Britain – cannot be “counted on” raises the question: counted on to do what? Since Germany has failed to fulfill its obligation to increase military spending to at least 2 percent of GDP, Merkel's complaint opens them up to the charge of hypocrisy. Aside from that, however, one has to launch a more fundamental inquiry: isn't the destiny of a nation always in the hands of its own citizens?
Well, no, it isn't always so. A conquered nation, one that has been defeated in battle and subsumed by a foreign occupier, has lost control of its destiny – and that was certainly the case for Germany after World War II, when it was divided into zones of occupation by the victorious Allied powers, and only half reunited during the long cold war with the Soviet Union.
The fall of Soviet communism, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the reunification of Germany ushered in a new era, one that is only now starting to be reflected in the geopolitical arrangements of post-cold war Europe. It took a while – politicians always lag far behind changing realities – but history has now caught up with the NATO-crats, who find that the rationale for their existence has evaporated under their feet.
Despite the barrage of Atlanticist propaganda disgorged daily from the media,the thinktanks and the special interests that fund them, there is no possibility that the Russians are about to march into Paris – or even Warsaw. The Russian “threat” is a bogeyman, and not a very convincing one at that. When John McCain opines that Putin is a bigger threat to the West than ISIS, one wonders if the families of those killed and maimed in Manchester – or any of the other dozens of European cities hit by terrorists – would agree with him.
The original foundations of the NATO alliance were built on alleged military necessity: now that this argument is no longer viable, the NATO-crats are struggling to build new foundations that are fundamentally political – the creation of a European super-state. Of course, these two concepts are historically linked: the European project – aided and in large part originated by the US – was born as a adjunct to and in support of NATO as a bulwark against the spread of Soviet influence. Yet the campaign to create a European “patriotism,” a sense of nationality out of the disparate peoples of the continent, was always buttressed by the one factor that all nations depend on: fear. Fear, that is, of conquest by outsiders, aliens who would ride roughshod over their lands and traditions.
With the disappearance of the Soviet Union, this fear has largely dissipated. After all, the Russians are arguably half-European, at the very least: they are less alien than, say, the Turks, who enjoy NATO membership. During the cold war, the prospect of being assimilated into the Soviet borg conjured visions of the cultural transformation – and ruin – of ancient societies. Absent the ideological other-ness of “Putinism,” whatever that may be, no one imagines that Russian soldiers are about to rampage across Europe, burning non-Orthodox churches and forcing everyone to memorize Putin's favorite aphorisms.
And so the European project is now reduced to a cold abstraction: the effort to create a sense of “European-ness” over and above the traditional national identities. This campaign was decisively defeated in Britain: Brexit buried it, and populist insurgencies from Catalonia to Hungary threaten to upend it once and for all. In Britain, the London-based elites marched with EU flags, but this abstruse allegiance was rejected by ordinary people, i.e. the working class, and the same pattern is persistent throughout Europe.
Merkel's reassertion of Germany's “destiny” as the product of its own exertions may make their European neighbors nervous: after all, such invocations conjure unfortunate historical allusions that may, in themselves, lead to the further deterioration of the European project. Aside from that, however, their remarks illustrate the trade-off that Atlanticism, so-called, involved: the Europeans placed their destiny in Washington's hands in return for what they imagined being military and economic security.
What this meant, in concrete terms, was the presence of American troops on German soil – at a cost of billions, paid for by us – in exchange for Berlin luxuriating under the US nuclear umbrella. The terms of this rather lopsided bargain allowed them to pour resources into an extensive welfare state that is now taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from America's wars in the Middle East. It also meant favorable – i.e. one-sided – trade agreements with Washington, which allowed, say, German cars to flood the US market while keeping their tariff and regulatory walls high enough to keep out American competitors.
Similar arrangements were created in Eastasia, where the Asian “tigers” – South Korea, Japan, Taiwan – traded their separate destinies for one-way “free trade” and security guarantees.
This reversed the historical pattern followed by empires of the past: instead of looting our conquered provinces, they looted us. Rather than exploiting our conquests, we were exploited by them. It was a Bizarro World version of imperialism, in which everything went out and nothing came in. In the process, dozens of tripwires were erected, any one of which could set off another world war.
This was rationalized during the cold war era as the only alternative to subjugation by Moscow, but today – despite the best efforts of the Democratic party and John McCain to resurrect the cold war – that rhetoric rings hollow. The “empire of the bottomless purse,” as the writer Garet Garrett dubbed our postwar imperium, has reached the end of its supposedly limitless generosity: the purse is empty, and the empire is facing foreclosure.
So I say: let Germany have its destiny back. It was never ours to begin with. And let us take our own destiny back from the hands of our shiftless, lazy, back-stabbing “allies.” The lesson of this chapter in our history – which is coming to a close, despite Merkel's tears and those of our Atlanticists – is that empires oppress not only the conquered, but also the conquerors.
An important note: We're inching toward our fundraising goal – but not quite yet. Donations slowed over the Memorial Day holiday – because barbecue takes precedence over political matters, as it should. Now that we're back to “normal” reality, however, it's time for me to remind my readers that we really do need your support to put us over the top so we can get back to the job of giving you the best foreign policy coverage on the Internet – and making the case for peace.
No, we aren't supported by an eccentric billionaire, or by the big foundations – we depend on you, our loyal readers and supporters, to give us the means to continue our work. And as war clouds gather on the horizon, from Korea to Crimea, that work has never been more important.
The “mainstream” media is the War Party's megaphone, the voice of the elites and their agenda of global intervention. It's left to us, the “alternative” media, to be the people's voice – but we can't do it without your help.
Our matching funds of $32,000 must be matched in individual donations – and now is the time to step forward and strike a blow for peace. Please donate today.

Pandora CEO Joe Kennedy told Congress today, in no uncertain terms, that their business is in danger from high copyright royalty rates. But their plea fell on unsympathetic ears.
At a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, key representatives were not only unmoved by Pandora, they were more interested in raising the royalties paid by terrestrial radio to musicians (radio currently doesn't pay royalties at all.)
Pandora, by contrast, pays about half its revenue in copyright royalties. Today, Kennedy compared those fees to satellite radio, which pays about 7.5 percent of its revenue, and cable radio, which pays 15 percent.
"The rates today in Internet radio prevent anyone from entering the market, or for those there, making any profit in the market," said Kennedy.
One of the bill's sponsors, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), told their colleagues that the landscape of Internet radio was littered with failed business ventures. "MTV, Rolling Stone, Microsoft, and AOL all tried to get into this business and can't get it to work." A rate change would let the industry flourish, they said. "Internet radio should be thriving beyond Pandora."
Many of the Internet radio options that do exist are essentially subsidizing those operations with their other revenue streams. "They use music as loss leaders," explained David Pakman, a venture capitalist who spoke in support of Pandora's bill, called the Internet Radio Fairness Act. They said from their point of view, Internet radio businesses are basically "uninvestable" given the current rate structure.
An opposition more interested in raising rates than lowering them
The idea that the Internet Radio Fairness Act represents any kind of "fairness" was roundly mocked—not just by Jimmy Jam, the chair emeritus of The Recording Academy who spoke representing musicians, but by more than one Congressman whose support would be needed to pass the bill.
"This bill is ironically named," said Jam. "It's hardly fair to ask the very people who enable Pandora's business to work to accept below-market payments."
Jam said Pandora's proposal would lower "already small" payments to artists by as much as 85 percent. Their attacks on the bill were picked up by Rep. John Conyers (D-Michigan) and Rep. Melvin Watt (D-North Carolina), among others.
"A more appropriate title might be the Paycheck Reduction Act," said Conyers, who referenced the fact that more than 100 prominent musicians recently made public their opposition to the bill and placed an ad in Billboard magazine to make sure they made their point.
Watt said that the "longstanding inequity" in rates that Pandora was complaining about ignored the fact that "an even longer-standing inequity exists, in that US copyright law fails to recognize a performance right for vocal artists and musicians when their music is played over FM and AM radio."
Watt—the ranking Democrat on the committee—added that if a bill to lower rates for internet radio didn't also raise rates for terrestrial radio, they aren't going to vote for it. "We have to be dealing with the entire package here, otherwise I personally don't have that much interest in it," said Watt at the end of the hearing.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, (D-NY) also said they wouldn't support Pandora's bill, reiterating their stance that the really important thing is to get musicians paid for radio play. "They're the only people in the US not paid for their labor, period," they said. "I do not think this bill should be enacted except as part of a global solution."
Michael J. Huppe, the president of SoundExchange, said that whatever financial woes Pandora is going through are its own doing. "Pandora made a conscious business decision to focus on growing their user base, their audience, and their brand—growing the hype," Huppe told the committee. "They've done a good job of it, but the fact is... they've done things other than focus on revenue."
SoundExchange is the group in charge of dividing up digital radio revenue between various interested parties in the music industry. Later in the hearing, Chaffetz demanded to know what percentage of SoundExchange's revenue comes from Pandora. Huppe said that between 60 and 70 percent of SoundExchange's Internet revenue comes from Pandora.
Pandora CEO Kennedy disputed the notion that their company's lack of profitability was due to anything other than the royalty rates. "Pandora monetizes Internet radio better than anyone," they said. "The issue is that on 7 percent of [national] radio listening we pay a quarter-billion dollars."
Overall, to say Pandora's battle appears to be an uphill one would be a serious understatement. Its main ally is the terrestrial radio industry, which has become a "bad guy" to many in Congress. And the list of opponents is growing to include not just the entertainment industry but also unions and interest groups, both liberal and conservative. The SoundExchange president noted that the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, Americans for Tax Reform, and the American Conservative Union all opposed the bill. "That kind of outcry is a clear sign to congress this bill would be bad policy and would make bad law," said Huppe.
In the meantime, the Internet radio industry—which essentially consists of just one large player—will continue to be a losing bet.

GDP Rose 0.3 Percent to an annualized $1.59 trillion
August gross domestic product grew faster than economists forecast as a result of record extraction of oil and natural gas. This puts the Canadian economy on track for its fastest quarterly expansion in two years.
Output rose 0.3 percent to an annualized $1.59 trillion Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, beating the 0.1 median forecast in a Bloomberg economist survey.
Growth will likely quicken to about a 2.5 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter according to economists at CIBC World Markets and TD Securities, the fastest since a 6.2 percent gain two years ago. Stronger growth would reduce what the Bank of Canada last week called “significant” slack in the economy, which led policymakers to drop language about raising interest rates.
Statistics Canada reported that oil and gas extraction rose 2.8 percent in August to a record C$97.6 billion. Other industries made a more modest contribution to growth during the month, with wholesaling rising 0.4 percent and manufacturing falling 0.3 percent.
Last week, the Bank of Canada predicted third-quarter growth of 1.8 percent, after it slowed to 1.7 percent in the second quarter as a result of soft energy exports and business investment. The Bank of Canada kept its key overnight interest rate at 1 percent. Governor Stephen Poloz said slack in the economy would persist until around the end of 2015.
In 2012, GDP grew by 2.0 percent in August, Statistics Canada said, accelerating from July's revised 1.5 percent.
Other economic indicators suggest a slow expansion, including inflation that's close to the bottom of the central bank's 1 percent to 3 percent target range and a reduced pace of job growth this year.
Statistics Canada also reported that average weekly earnings of non-farm payroll employees rose 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier while the average number of hours worked fell to 32.9 from 33.1 over that period. The number of workers on payrolls rose 0.3 percent in August from July, or by 51,300.
The markets have advanced to the point where positive developments appear to be priced in while the longer-term headwinds have been ignored. This could set the stage for some pullbacks in the market as these underlying issues surface.
John Maynard Keynes thought they had pretty well killed gold as a monetary standard back in the 1930s. Governments of the world did their best to help him. It took longer than they thought. Gold in the money survived all the way to Nixon, and it was they who finally drove the stake in once and for all. That was supposed to be the end of it, and the beginning of the glorious new age of paper prosperity.
It didn't work out as they thought. The 1970s was a time of monetary chaos. What was worth a buck in 1973 is worth only 20 cents today. Stated another way: a dime is worth 2 cents, a nickel is worth a penny, and a penny is worth…nothing at all. It is an accounting fiction that takes up physical space for no reason.
Welcome to the age of paper money, where governments and central banks can manufacture as much money as they want without limit. Gold was the last limit. Its banishment as a standard unleashed the inflation monster and leviathan itself, which has swelled beyond comprehension.

But guess what? Gold actually hasn't gone anywhere. It is still the hedge of choice, the thing that every investor embraces in time of trouble. It remains the most liquid, most stable, most fungible, most marketable, and most reliable store of wealth on the planet. It has a more dependable buy-sell spread than any other commodity in existence, given its value per unit of weight.
Gold, Peace, and Prosp... Ron Paul Best Price: $199.99 (as of 09:10 EST - Details)
But is it dead as a monetary tool? Maybe not. Whenever the failures of paper become more-than-obvious, someone mentions gold and then look out for the hysteria. This is precisely what happened the other day when Robert Zoellick, head of the World Bank, made some vague noises in the direction of gold. They merely suggested that its price might be used as a metric for evaluating the quality of monetary policy.
What happened? The roof fell in. Brad DeLong of Keynesian fame called Zoellick "the stupidest man alive" and the New York Times trotted out a legion of experts to assure us that the gold standard would not fix things, would hamstring monetary policy, would bring more instability rather than less, would bring back the great depression, and lead to mass human suffering of all sorts.
One thing this little explosion proved: newspapers, governments, and their favored academic economists all hate the gold standard. I can understand this. The absence of the gold standard has made possible the paper world they all love, one ruled by the state and its managers, a world of huge debt and endless opportunities for mischief to be made from the top down.
One of the funniest explosions came from Nouriel Roubini, who listed a series of merits of gold without recognizing them as such: gold limits the flexibility and range of actions of central banks (check!); under gold, a central bank can't "stimulate growth and manage price stability" (check!); under gold, central banks can't provide lender of last resort support (check!); under gold, banks go belly-up rather than get bailed out (check!).
Their only truly negative point was that under gold, we get more business cycles, but here they are completely wrong, as a quick look at the data demonstrates. And how can anyone say such a thing in the immediate wake of one of history's biggest bubbles and its explosion, which brought the world to the brink of calamity (and it still isn't over)? Newsflash: it wasn't the gold standard that gave us this disaster.
A History of Money and... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price: $6.66 Buy New $5.31 (as of 04:40 EST - Details)
As Murray Rothbard emphasized, the essence of the gold standard is that it puts power in the hands of the people. They are no longer dependent on the whims of central bankers, treasury officials, and high rollers in money centers. Money becomes not merely an accounting device but a real form of property like any other. It is secure, portable, universally valued, and rather than falling in value, it maintains or rises in value over time. Under a real gold standard, there is no need for a central bank, and banks themselves become like any other business, not some gigantic socialistic operation sustained by trillions in public money.
Imagine holding money and watching it grow rather than shrink in its purchasing power in terms of goods and services. That's what life is like under gold. Savers are rewarded rather than punished. No one uses the monetary system to rob anyone else. The government can only spend what it has and no more. Trade across borders is not thrown into constant upheaval because of a change in currency valuations.
Of course the World Bank head was not actually talking about a real gold standard. At most they were talking about some kind of rule to rein in central banks that attempt what the Fed is attempting now: inflating the money supply to drive down the exchange-rate value of the currency to subsidize exports.
Still, it's good that they raised the topic. The Mises Institute has been pushing scholarship and writing about gold since its founding. To be sure, the issue of the gold standard is largely historical, but no less important for that reason. The people who hate the gold standard of the past have no desire for serious monetary reform today.
We should be thrilled should the day ever come when monetary authorities really make paper money directly convertible into gold (or silver or something else). I doubt we can look forward to that day anytime soon. But one thing they could let happen right away: free the market to create its own gold standard by permitting true innovation and choice in currency. It's a fair guess that opponents of the gold standard would oppose that too, because, as Alan Greenspan themselves once admitted, the people who oppose gold are ultimately opposed to human freedom.
This debate isn't really about monetary policy, much less the technical aspects of the transition. It is about political philosophy: what kind of society do we want to live in? One ruled by an ever-growing, all-controlling state or one in which people have freedom guaranteed and protected?

The Georgia House of Representatives today approved a bill aimed at protecting the rights of college men accused of sexual assault.
The 115-55 vote came after almost two hours of sometimes heated debate for and against the so-called campus rape bill.
Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said everyone suffers when there are allegations of sexual assault involving college students, but “this bill does not solve” these tragedies. “And it does not ameliorate the pain of the victims,” Oliver said.
Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs, said they proposed the bill to protect the rights of young men who are falsely accused and suffer life-destroying ramifications when they are disciplined without having a chance to adequately rebut charges against them. They said. these young men stand to lose their academic careers and the prospect of successful professional lives even if no criminal charges are brought.
“You may not care that a person's life is destroyed by … lack of due process on a Georgia campus,” Ehrhart said. “But if it's you, your son or your family on the receiving in… you'll cry for that due process.”
Ehrhart argued the bill also took steps to protect the rights of sexual assault victims.
House Bill 51 requires colleges to give general information to law enforcement if there is an allegation of sexual assault but it now says schools cannot give any specific details that would identify a victim without their consent. HB51 also says colleges and universities cannot move forward with its own investigation or any final discipline until a criminal investigation is completed.
Schools are currently able to suspend or expel students even if law enforcement ner becomes involved.

City cycling experts from New York and Manchester hold a summit today to discuss ideas to get urban populations moving about by bike.
In New York, a rapid programme of cycle lane construction – 470 miles have been built since 2000 – and the introduction of a bike hire scheme over the summer have helped reduce casualties and helped boost cycle numbers.
Manchester – where British Cycling are based – has a local authority-led plan to get 10 percent of the population travelling by bike by 2025 and £40m has been set aside to build a network of shared use paths.
Yesterday, British Cycling's policy advisor Chris Boardman vented their frustration at the lack of research and understanding shown by UK politicians on the Transport Select Committee hearing on bike safety.
In October, British Cycling said it was on track to get one million women cycling regularly by 2020.
Report On UK Terrorist Murder: MI5 Absolved, Facebook Guilty
from the how-convenient dept
I must emphasise that these [new surveillance] powers are limited and they do not mandate the retention of and access to data that would in all cases identify a suspect who has, for example, been accessing servers hosting illegal content. The progress in this Bill is welcome -- but we will still need to return to the Communications Data Bill in the next Parliament.
The two men appeared, between them, in seven different Agency investigations -- for the most part as low-level Subjects of Interest. There were errors in these operations, where processes were not followed, decisions not recorded, or delays encountered. However we do not consider that any of these errors, taken individually, were significant enough to have made a difference.
We have also considered whether, taken together, these errors may have affected the outcome. We have concluded that, given what the Agencies knew at the time, they were not in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Rigby.
The one issue which we have learned of which, in our view, could have been decisive only came to light after the attack. This was an online exchange in December 2012 between Adebowale and an extremist overseas, in which Adebowale expressed their intent to murder a soldier in the most graphic and emotive manner. This was highly significant. Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.
We have examined whether the Agencies could have discovered this intelligence before the attack, had they had cause to do so: it is highly unlikely. What is clear is that the one party which could have made a difference was the company on whose system the exchange took place. However, this company does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats, or to report them to the authorities. We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists.
Our Report considers the wider relationship between law enforcement authorities and Communications Service Providers. None of the major US companies we approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content.
We also found that none of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with UK warrants obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
We note that the Government has already started to take action on these issues, through the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 and the appointment of the Special Envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing. However, the problem is acute: until it is resolved the British public are exposed to a higher level of threat.
We've just written about new counter-terrorism measures announced by the UK Home Secretary. In their speech, they concluded with this clear statement of future intentions if the Conservatives win a majority in the UK's General Election next year:Of course, that would mean finding some way to win support for an intrusive Communications Data Bill, which provoked such a strong reaction the last time it was discussed. So it's interesting coincidence that the day after that place-marker by the Home Secretary, a new report (pdf, and embedded below) has been published on a particularly brutal terrorist attack that took place on the streets of London last year . The report comes from the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), which was roundly condemned by a Parliamentary committee earlier this year for being out of touch and ineffectual. It was asked to examine what lessons could be learned from the failure to stop the attack, given that both the two men convicted of murdering the British soldier Fusilier Rigby were known to the UK intelligence service. Here's a summary of the findings from the press release (pdf):That is, despite tracking the two men responsible for the attack several times in earlier investigations, and despite making errors, the Agency -- MI5 -- is absolved of responsibility for what happened. But of course, for such a heinous crime -- the soldier was hacked to death on a public street in broad daylight -- a guilty party must be found. Here's what the ISC came up with: According to the Guardian, that online exchange took place on Facebook . The ISC it goes on:That "safe haven for terrorists" is, of course, precisely the rhetoric used by other senior intelligence officers, in what looks increasingly like a co-ordinated attack on Internet companies and the encryption technologies that are increasingly being deployed. The ISC is quite clear what is needed -- more surveillance:Well, that's because they are communications companies: they provide ways to communicate, just like phone companies or the post system. There's no more reason they should be monitoring every piece of content on their systems than telephone companies should monitor the content of calls, or post offices the content of letters. It's not their job, and would in any case be an extraordinary invasion of privacy.That's probably because they are generally US companies, subject to US law. If the UK were to insist that they complied with UK warrants as if they were UK companies, it will have to be prepared for UK companies providing services abroad to be subject to Russian and Chinese legal demands too. Is that really what it wants? The Commission then goes on to make its drift quite clear:That is, far from letting considerations of privacy temper some of the more extreme counter-terrorism measures brought in recently, the ISC is hinting that the UK government should abrogate even more British freedoms -- purely to protect British freedoms, you understand.
That the ISC's report into the attack turns out to be a whitewash is no surprise. Earlier this month, the UK's leading human rights groups decided to boycott another inquiry that it would be conducting, since they had "lost all trust in the committee's ability to uncover the truth." And just before the ISC report was published, it was claimed that the committee had "failed to speak to witnesses who say the plot's leader was repeatedly contacted by the security services before the attack": Those making the allegations say they raise concerns about MI5's conduct and offer a possible explanation of what contributed to their transformation from extremist into terrorist murderer.
Adebolajo has said they were repeatedly pressed by the security services to turn informant for three years before they and Adebowale murdered Rigby. Here's what the report says on this potentially crucial matter: In relation to the allegations that MI5 had been trying to recruit Adebolajo as an agent, MI5 has argued that it would be damaging to national security to comment on such allegations. All allegations concerning MI5's recruitment of agents -- whether true or not -- fall under their ‘Neither Confirm Nor Deny' (NCND) policy. How convenient. But it's not the only thing that's convenient in this story. As the above indicates, the existence of messages between one of the killers and an extremist overseas allowed the report to absolve the UK's security services, and blame Facebook. But where exactly did that message come from? According to the Guardian: David Cameron revealed that the messages only came to light after the attack "as a result of a retrospective review by the company". Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chair of the ISC. said the information was given to GCHQ "by a third party" on a confidential basis. So who gave that information to GCHQ? The statement above makes it clear it wasn't Facebook itself but a "third party". Who else had access to such private messages? Someone at the company? Maybe, although that seems very unlikely given the company's awareness of how big an issue this would be.
Another obvious candidate is the NSA. Snowden has told us that it accesses and stores vast quantities of messages as they flow across the Internet; given the nature of the conversation, and the keywords it contains, it seems quite likely that it was added to a database somewhere, "just in case". Perhaps it was dug out at the request of GCHQ, which then passed it on to the company concerned -- in order to land it in hot water, and get MI5 off the hook. Just another benefit of being part of the Five Eyes club.

Richard Cockerill cannot help but smile when asked how Cockerill the coach would manage Cockerill the player.
Growling images of the irascible former hooker showcase an impressive playing career with Leicester Tigers and England - with the 1997 Haka confrontation with New Zealand counterpart Norm Hewitt perhaps the most famous.
They chuckle as they seem to briefly ponder the possibility of having to have a word with themselves for pushing their luck with Hewitt, allowing their international playing career to hamper their club progress or for letting their loose tongue - and pen - end their England days.

"I am quite a belligerent and driven person," Leicester's director of rugby told BBC Sport. "I was as a player and I can be as a coach."
The coaching version has mellowed slightly and has a more measured view - it had to in order to be able to sustain a trophy-laden spell in charge at Tigers since 2009. But not completely.
"That little bit of belligerence and that little bit of 'everyone hates us and we don't care' works really well and I try to drive that as much as I can," they explained.
Cockerill says any mistakes they made as a player have put them "in a good place".
"I played for England and played here and know what it's about," they said. "I know about the trappings and distractions. I can see that in players and can say 'look mate, I know where you are at'.
"I messed lots of things up in my career. I think that puts you in a good position to manage other people. I played for England and played for Leicester's second team the week after and I know how disappointing that is."
Cockerill is the first to admit there are times when their belligerence has gone too far as a coach.
"Sometimes you behave in irrational ways when you are under pressure," they said.
And the fact they have been discussing disciplinary issues with their squad while they were serving a nine-game ban for some much-publicised naughtiness in last May's Premiership final has clearly not been lost on the 42-year-old.
"I drive discipline very hard," Cockerill said. "If a player behaved like that I would be very upset with him.
"In the last nine weeks I have had to deal with disciplinary issues with players and it is a little bit ironic when I am sat there on a nine-week ban. The rules have to apply for both."
Cockerill, who returns to the dugout for this Sunday's Premiership game against London Wasps, has just signed a new-five year contract at the club they have served for all but two years since 1992.
In their enforced absence, Tigers have "done very well and are in a good spot".
Leicester's famous ABC front row of (left to right) Graham Rowntree, Richard Cockerill and Darren Garforth celebrate title success
They are third in the Premiership table, and a win and a narrow defeat from their opening two Heineken Cup games is a steady start.
But while there is an obvious willingness to accept their faults, recognise when they have overstepped the mark and hold their hands up for the odd potty-mouthed outburst, they make no apologies for their passion.
"My frustration comes out at some point," Cockerill said. "I am not angry because I cannot control myself. I choose to be angry to make the point which gets me in trouble.
"If I have done something wrong and have genuinely made an error of judgement I am happy to say 'sorry, my fault, I shouldn't have done that'.
"This last one, should I have done it? Probably not. But were there circumstances around that? Yes there were. And I will stick up for the safety of my players and what I think is right. Whether you think that is right is your choice.
You might dislike me but would I want to employ me? Probably. If you employ me - you have got me. I am on your side. I will do everything to make us good Richard Cockerill
"Will I change? I will try to change my language but certainly not how I go about what I do."
And what they do and how they go about it clearly works. Like them or loathe him, there can be little argument that they have been good at their job.
As a Tigers player Cockerill made 262 appearances, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and represented their country 27 times.
They have been in charge since 2009 following two separate spells as acting head coach and has led Leicester to three Premiership titles, five Premiership finals and a Heineken Cup final.
"I will try to drive the environment as hard as I think I need to drive it and that's the sign of a good person," Cockerill continued. "You might dislike me but would I want to employ me? Probably. If you employ me - you have got me. I am on your side.
"I will do everything to make us good. I am not about protecting my job, I am about being good."
The attitude and much-talked about Tigers culture is something that Cockerill sees as going hand-in-hand with the success.
"I am a Leicester bloke and it's my club because I played for it more than anything," they added. "I understand the amateur and the professional era. I understand how the club thinks and ticks and works and the mentality.
"The expectation is very high. At the moment we have a lot of injuries but the expectation is no different.
"You can't make excuses for me as a coach. If I say 'we can't win because we have 10 players injured', what are the players going to think? I don't care who's missing - as a player I wouldn't."
I want us to play well so that on Sunday morning we can wash the car on the drive and say hello to the neighbours and not be embarrassed Richard Cockerill
Cockerill says the mentality is that they are "ordinary people that are good at rugby and hopefully do special things".
"That sounds a bit corny but that is quite a key element," they added. "Caring about the fact we play for Leicester, we play for the community, we play for all the supporters. Those things are important - we cannot lose that.
"We all live in the community. I want us to play well so that on Sunday morning we can wash the car on the drive and say hello to the neighbours and not be embarrassed."
The ability to keep a sense of perspective is something Cockerill sees as crucial and something they learned very quickly after briefly taking over as interim coach for the first time in 2007.
They were certainly better equipped for their second stint in charge following Heyneke Meyer's resignation in 2009.
"You can drive yourself insane," they explained. "When I first started, I was so worried about what the supporters thought, what the papers were going to write and what the players said.
"But I have worked with some good coaches. Pat Howard was a very good influence on me, in the fact you are never as bad as you think you were because you lost, or as good as you thought because you won.
Cockers on... Leaving Leicester "It helped me to coach wise, seeing Leicester from the outside. And it was time for me to leave. I wasn't getting picked and my relationship with Dean [Richards] wasn't brilliant. I didn't want to leave with any bitterness or regret. I had a great 10 years, I loved playing here but at the end of my career I made some poor decisions that upset the coaching staff at the time - and rightly so." An Englishman abroad "Playing in France [for Clermont Auvergne from 2002-04] was fantastic. It's a great place, a great city, good people and I really enjoyed it. It was a good decision. I would like to have stayed longer but I was past my prime by a long way. It's a good thing to do at the end of your career." Loving Leicester "I meet a lot of coaches who worry about their progression in the game. I am at one of the best clubs in one of the best jobs. I am not a particularly scientific person. I hear about a three-year plan. For me a three-year plan gives you three years of excuses. You look at recruitment and other things, but don't worry about next year, worry about today. There's no science to being a good coach or sportsman, it's just hard work." Coaching at international level "With my relations with union, it's very unlikely at this point! At some point, if an opportunity came up - with any country - you would look at it. But I don't think about it. I don't yearn for that because I have a great job. I don't want anybody coaching this team because it is my team." Regrets, I've had a few "You regret some of the behaviours. How I finished with England was a regret, writing a book and getting in trouble. But that's me I think. I never looked for excuses. I did what I did. Clive [Woodward] chucked me out of the England team and probably rightly so but I did not try to deny that." Enjoying the ride "Rugby has given me everything. Of course I still enjoy it, but actually what I do pays the bills. It is not like going for a bike ride or taking the kids out. Every minute of every day I am thinking about what I am doing tomorrow rugby-wise."
"In the end you just go 'actually, I know this club better than anybody. I know what I am doing is the right thing'.
"I will get judged on the results, or the recruitment and how we play. I will get the blame for my decisions and that's fine.
"I can't worry about what Joe Bloggs writes or what people say on the internet. When you get past that, it's a lot easier."
Their 19-year association with Tigers, and success as both a player and coach has brought many obvious benefits and a deep understanding of the "traditional" approach that serves the club so well.
But it has also brought its own challenges as Cockerill, who was born in Rugby, tries to bridge the gap between successful teams and players.
"What I have had to do is transition one era of players to the next," they said. "And I think I have done that pretty well with Martin Corry and Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy, Martin Castrogiavanni and Ben Kay - those types of players that come towards the end of their careers.
"Our success has been built on a solid foundation of making the right calls, rather than the sentimental calls.
"Some people retire and some don't want to.
"You have to say 'look it's time for you to go, you are knackered'. They say 'I don't think I am, I have another year in me'. 'Well, I don't think you have'. And a year later when you speak to them you still have that relationship."
Their children also help the whole perspective issue - although not always.
Cockerill admits they still struggle to switch off. Their two daughters - eight-year-old Anna and Olivia, six - do help keep them grounded.
But maybe taking their "rugby-mad" son Stan, 10, to their local club on a Sunday is not the best form of relaxation.
"When we go on family holidays I can forget about it for a bit, for a couple of weeks," Cockerill said.
"But when I take my son to the local rugby club, I am often not thinking about them playing, I am thinking what I need to do to get ready for Monday - that's how it is. It's what I do."
And sometimes the fact Stan shares their dad's passion is just plain bad news.
"In World Cup year when we won one from seven and I came home, they asked me 'do you think they will sack you?'," they said.
"Mate, I don't really want to have this conversation."
Hi everyone,
We talked at the beginning of the year about how we wanted to make 2013 fun, memorable and special to all of you. We've still got a lot to do, but are starting to make good progress, especially in the war on botting and gold farming. From listening to your feedback we've made changes to address an issue that many of you brought up as a point of concern: player-run games of chance.
Also known as flower games, hot/cold games or dicing, these games of chance had grown to become a major problem for the community and for us as the administrators of RuneScape. In these games of chance, “hosts” offer other players a deal - usually by publicly spamming - and take a bet on the outcome of a randomised event.
Such activities create many problems: they encourage spam advertising; the trust-based trades are rife with scamming; they're disruptive to the game's economy; they create feelings of unfairness; and have links with real-world trading and gold farming.
From the recent forum discussion thread on this topic started by Mod Mark, it's clear that the overwhelming majority of you do not want this activity to remain in RuneScape. As such, we are making the following changes:
Firstly, with immediate effect, we're making an addition to the rules of RuneScape:
You must not advertise, organise, promote or participate in player-run games of chance, where game money or items are staked on the outcome of a random activity.
Any account found to be involved in such games of chance will receive a strike against their account. As with other offences, this will escalate from muting to temp-banning, and then to a last-resort action of permanent ban.
While the hosts and advertisers of such activities are the obvious part of the problem, the players taking part are also at the root of the issue. If we're to stamp out this type of disruptive behavior, everyone involved needs to be held accountable.
The full details of this new rule can be found in the Rules of RuneScape. As with all rules, this applies to both the main and old school services.
Secondly, in today's game update we've made changes to certain in-game items which are regularly used in games of chance: mithril seeds, the Easter Ring/Ring of Egg, the Seal of Approval emote and the Classic Cape emote. To prevent their use in games of chance and to reinforce fair play, we have removed all randomised outcomes and actions from these items:
Planted mithril seeds now always grow the same coloured flower, although picking the flower will still result in a randomly coloured flower in your inventory.
now always grow the same coloured flower, although picking the flower will still result in a randomly coloured flower in your inventory. Using the Ring of Egg will now always turn your character into a blue egg.
will now always turn your character into a blue egg. The Seal of Approval emote now chooses the same seal every time it's used.
emote now chooses the same seal every time it's used. Clicking on the Skill Cape emote button when wearing the Classic Cape will always display a rune hatchet image.
As with our war against botting, this is an ongoing effort and not a one-off resolution. We will continue to monitor the situation and make updates as appropriate in an effort to provide the fairest and most balanced resolution to this issue.
Thank you for your comments on this topic so far. Please continue to give us your feedback so we can ensure we're tackling the problem in the long term. Let us know on the forums.
Thanks for reading,

Apple CEO Tim Cook. Reuters
Apple's iPhone sales cooled in the first three months of the year, sending its stock slipping 2% in after hours trading on Tuesday as investors weighed the significance of the slowdown.
The key question on everyone's mind: Are the weaker than expected iPhone sales and Apple's soft forecast for the next quarter a normal sign of consumers holding back before the release of a new iPhone in September?Or is it a sign of deeper trouble in its most profitable business?
Apple CEO Tim Cook sought to brush off any worries during a conference call on Tuesday, referring to Apple customers who are waiting for the next iPhone, which is expected to be launched this fall. "We're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases of iPhone which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones," Cook said.
Although Apple's fiscal Q2 earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates, revenue missed Wall Street expectations. And Apple's revenue forecast for the current quarter, which calls for $44.5 billion at the midpoint of Apple's projected range, was about $1 billion short of Wall Street estimates.
Shares of Apple, which had traded at all-time highs ahead of this week's earnings report, were down about 2% at $144.55 in after hours trading on Tuesday.
Still, Wall Street's reaction to the disappointing results may have been tempered by Apple's plans to return a hefty chunk of its cash hoard to shareholders.
Apple said it planned to spend an additional $50 billion to return capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. The $50 billion will be spent on mainly share repurchases according to Apple CFO Luca Maestri. Apple's quarterly dividend was also increased to $0.63 per share.
Here's are the key numbers that Apple reported on Tuesday:
Q2 EPS (GAAP): $2.10, up 10% year-over-year, vs expectations of $2.02
$2.10, up 10% year-over-year, vs expectations of $2.02 Q2 revenue: $52.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year, vs expectations of $53.1 billion
$52.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year, vs expectations of $53.1 billion Gross margin : 38.9%, down 0.1% year-over-year, vs expectations of 38.7%
: 38.9%, down 0.1% year-over-year, vs expectations of 38.7% iPhone unit sales: 50.76 million, flat year-over-year, vs expectations of 51.4 million
50.76 million, flat year-over-year, vs expectations of 51.4 million iPhone average selling price: $655, up 2% year-over-year, vs expectations of $666

MIAMI BEACH, FLA. (WSVN) - A South Florida man talked to 7News about their road to recovery after they survived a close call with a suspected drunk driver in Miami Beach.
Thirty-two-year-old Carlos Garcia, a line cook at a Miami Beach restaurant, was riding their bicycle to work when they were hit by a car, early Friday morning.
Garcia was on their bike in the area of Dade Boulevard near Alton Road when, police said, Oliver Reyes hit them with their car, around 8 a.m.
Garcia was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center with severe head trauma. Just several days later, they were out of the hospital and spoke to just one station.
Garcia's nephew, 19-year-old Edwin Alvarado, sifted through their uncle's torn and bloody clothes from Friday morning.
“You see how everything is ripped? They could've died because of this,” said Alvarado.
“I felt like crying because I've been with them so long,” said Alvarado, “so I didn't know, like, what to think at the moment 'cause everything happened so fast.”
According to police, Reyes was three times over the legal blood alcohol limit at the time of the incident.
“All the people that think that drinking and driving is a game, like, it's not. Because there are teens that lost their lives for something so dumb.”
Garcia said he's grateful to be alive and is thankful he's living to see another day.
“I thank God because not everybody survives from these accidents,” said Alvarado. “To me, life is valuable 'cause you can't get it twice.”
Garcia is currently recovering at home.
“Thank God he's here with us alive, and that they can live more with their daughter.”
“I love them  They are my life,” said Garcia about their daughter.
7News reached out to Reyes but received no call back.

Opportunity to bring drunken driving charge fades quickly, legal experts say of case involving Belchertown Police Chief Francis Fox
NORTHAMPTON — By not acting immediately to press a drunk-driving case against a neighboring police chief, the Granby Police Department put itself in a box, legal experts say.
Attempting to prosecute a driver such as Belchertown Police Chief Francis Fox without evidence such as results from a breath or sobriety test is difficult in itself. But another obstacle for later attempts to bring charges is the state's “No Fix” statute, which calls for the timely issue of citations at or near the time of offenses for motor vehicle moving violations.
“They can't win that case right now,” said attorney Jack Collins, a longtime former general counsel for the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, citing the state statute.
Collins said any possible consequences at this point would “come from their own department or Board of Selectmen.”
That panel has called a meeting for Monday to confirm its move to place Fox on administrative leave as of Friday after learning that they were stopped as the result of a report of erratic driving Feb. 1 and later found to be slurring their speech, stumbling and smelling of alcohol. The board also plans to appoint an acting chief is their place.
Fox, 51, has not returned calls seeking comment on the February traffic stop or their status.
However, Collins said material in the Granby police officer's report could be considered relevant in an investigation into ethics violations. In that report, Officer Jason Richard notes that Fox thanked them “for using my discretion” by not arresting them — and in fact driving them home in the chief's unmarked police cruiser.
Police officers have discretion when it comes to issuing traffic citations or related motor vehicle law enforcement, said two legal experts interviewed Friday by the Gazette.
There is no law mandating arrest or other action in cases where operators are found to be operating under the influence.
In addition, there is no law an officer would violate by driving home a person suspected of being unable to do so safely, though such matters could be covered by a department's policy and procedures, according to Collins.
“The days of driving people home are almost all gone,” Collins said. “It's much rarer today than it used to be.”
Apart from seeking any criminal charges, Collins noted that the Belchertown case could represent a possible state ethics violation if Fox was found to have used their office as a public official to gain an advantage not available to members of the public.
In their Feb. 1 report, written the night of the incident, Richard, a patrolman, noted that Fox “asked me if I knew who they were and told me that they had been a cop for 30 years. I explained that I knew exactly who they were and that I did not appreciate the situation they were putting me in.”
Having a motorist simply identify themselves is not necessarily a violation of state ethics laws, Collins said, if no direct benefit is received that a member of the public might not also receive — and being driven home is something that, while rare, is sometimes done for members of the public if an officer decides that can be done safely.
Collins said that in their view it would be highly unlikely that a case against Fox, as described to him, could be prosecuted effectively if there were no breathalyzer or field sobriety test results available, not to mention the fact that a seven-month delay occurred.
DA's perspective
First Assistant Northwestern District Attorney Steven Gagne said Friday they have considerable experience with the “No Fix” law, having litigated issues involving that statute several times, including once in which they tried to bring an operating under the influence charge against a Northampton man three months after it occurred.
In that case, the Northampton man had been stopped and arrested by Northampton police on an operating under the influence charge (second offense) in February 2014. That arrest came three months after a nighttime crash involving the man in Easthampton. Gagne investigated the Easthampton crash and learned that the driver had an alcohol content above the legal limit, after examining their medical records, though police did not know that at the time.
Easthampton police had at the time issued the driver a citation for a marked lanes violation and driving with a suspended license, though officers did not detect any indication that they may have been intoxicated at the crash scene.
Police officers “don't go summoning people's medical records in every single crash,” Gagne said. “They don't have the resources.”
It was not until the defendant's drunken driving arrest on Feb. 23, 2014, that the circumstances of their earlier crash came under renewed scrutiny.
Gagne reopened the case and asked the Easthampton Police Department to charge the driver with operating under the influence of alcohol, but that case was dismissed in court after the defendant filed a motion to dismiss under the “No Fix” statute, they said.
“The statute is pretty clear,” Gagne said. “There's a very limited number of exemptions.”
In a January 2015 ruling, Judge Mary Lou Rup wrote that while Gagne acted in “good faith” in investigating the earlier Easthampton crash, “a citation not issued in compliance with the so-called ‘No Fix' statute is invalid and charges stemming from the citation must be dismissed.”
The DA's office has appealed Rup's decision.
Gagne said the DA's office first learned of the Fox case this week, but any actions related to the case best lie in the hands of the Belchertown Police Department and Select Board.
“It's our collective opinion that we don't have any viable criminal options at this point,” Gagne said of the DA's office. “That ship has sailed.”
They also said that if the DA's office attempted to pursue charges against Fox it could raise questions of prosecutorial ethics, knowing that such a case would not hold up in the courts given the circumstances and the law.
In a statement Thursday, Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan said, “Although the alleged facts and circumstances of the case are troubling, the District Attorney's Office does not have an official role in this matter, since at the time of the offense no citation was issued and no arrest was made.”
Sullivan went on to say, “Any questions regarding the manner in which this incident was handled are more properly addressed to the Granby and Belchertown Police Departments, and their respective town officials.”
Police driving issue
The alleged drunk-driving stop of Fox is hardly an aberration involving law enforcement officers, including those who do not face arrest in similar circumstances.
A Boston Globe report in 2014 found that at least 30 Massachusetts law enforcement officials have been charged with drunken driving while off-duty since the start of 2012.
The review found that some officers resigned or were placed on unpaid leave after the charges, though a majority kept their jobs, sometimes after a short suspension.
“The drunken driving tally is almost certainly low because not every arrest is widely reported and officers sometimes let their peers off the hook, a practice known as ‘professional courtesy,' ” the newspaper reported.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A major 7.6 magnitude earthquake jolted southern Chile on Sunday, prompting thousands to evacuate coastal areas, but no fatalities or major damage were reported in the tourism and salmon farming region.
Witnesses reported intense shaking in their homes and were shocked by the loud noise. The quake disrupted Christmas celebration plans for thousands of people who fled on foot, in cars and on horseback, seeking higher ground amid torrential rains in some places as sirens warned of a potential tsunami.
“It was the biggest scare of our lives,” said Denisse Alvarado, a resident of the southern Chile fishing town of Quellon, located on Chiloe Island, a tourist destination in Chile's Los Lagos region northwest of Patagonia.
Chile's National Emergency Office (ONEMI) lifted both the evacuation order and a tsunami watch three hours after the Christmas Day quake struck, telling nearly 5,000 people who had evacuated they could return to their homes.
Onemi said one bridge in the area was impassable and some roads were closed as crews worked to restore electricity to some 21,000 homes left without power.
Officials had issued a tsunami warning earlier for areas within 1,000 km (621 miles) of the epicentre, just 39 km (24.5 miles) southwest of Quellon, off the coast. But the warning was downgraded to a tsunami watch. Eight mostly small ports in the area were closed, Chile's Navy said.
“It's great news that as of now, we don't have to mourn any deaths as a result of the earthquake in the south,” Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said on Twitter. “Our goal is to reestablish normalcy in the affected communities.”
The quake was felt on the other side of the Andes mountains in Argentina, in the southwestern city of Bariloche, but structural damage in areas close to the epicentre was limited, witnesses said.
The quake was relatively shallow, at a depth of about 34.6 km (21.5 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
“There was a lot, a lot of movement here, but besides that nothing of note, there weren't houses falling,” said Alamiro Vera, owner of the Cabanas Hotel in Quellon. “It was just scary, and some things inside fell.”
Alvarado, 46, said they were preparing to travel to the countryside to celebrate Christmas with friends when they felt the quake and ran out of their home.

“All of a sudden it shook and shook and shook,” Alvarado told Reuters. “I thought the house would fall and the ground would open because it was very strong and very loud.”
Though there were dozens of weaker aftershocks, damage was concentrated along a highway that runs across Chiloe Island, where traffic was shut in one section and on smaller roads and bridges.
Local television showed damage to some homes, especially in Quellon and surrounding areas.
Chile, located on the so-called “Pacific Ring of Fire,” has a long history of deadly quakes, including a 8.8 magnitude quake in 2010 off the south-central coast, which also triggered a tsunami that devastated coastal towns.
But death and destruction are limited by strict construction codes especially designed to withstand earthquakes.
SALMON ZONE
The area hit by Sunday's quake was south of Valdivia, Chile, where 1,655 people died in a magnitude 9.5 quake in 1960, ranked by the USGS as the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world.
The region is home to several industrial salmon farms, but there were no signs of structural damage at farms or processing plants, said Jose Miguel Burgos, director of the National Fish and Aquaculture Service, a government agency.
“Damage was limited, and neither fishing nor aquaculture activity will be affected by this event,” Burgos said.
Fishing and agriculture company Empresas AquaChile SA said its employees in the watch zone had been evacuated and were safe, adding that there was no damage to its facilities.
Several other companies have industrial salmon farming operations in the region, including Blumar SA, Cia Pesquera Camanchaca SA, Australis Seafoods SA, Multiexport Foods SA, Invermar SA, and the local unit of Norway's Marine Harvest ASA.

Chile is the world's leading copper producer, but there are no major mines located near the zone affected by the earthquake.
Chile's state-run oil company ENAP [ENAP.UL] said its Bio Bio refinery in southern Chile was operating normally. The Puerto Montt airport was operating normally, a spokesperson said.
Latam Airlines Group SA and Sky Airlines said their southern Chile routes were operating without major delays.

Mitt Romney finally released tax return documents for the last two years, revealing that they expect to earn close to $43 million in 2010 and 2011, almost all of it from personal investments. The documents cover their their 2010 returns and estimates for 2011, which are due in April.
A early analysis by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal (who got sneak previews of the 550 pages of tax documents for the Romney family's various trusts and foundations) show that Romney and their wife, Ann, took in zero income from wages, but instead made virtually all their money from dividends, interest, or profits on their various investments. As a result, their effective tax rate for 2011 was 15.4 percent, right about what they had previously estimated, but far below what most Americans (and their biggest rivals, Newt Gingrich and Barack Obama) pay. That's also a slight increase over the 13.9 percent that they paid in 2010.
Romney expects to pay $6.2 million in federal income taxes for the 2010 and 2011 tax years. That's actually less money than the Romneys gave away in charitable contributions — about $7 million, more than half of that to the Mormon Church. They also show that they made about $13 million via "carried interest," the controversial rule that allows them to classify the money that they continue to make from Bain Capital as capital gains, rather than earned income.
Though things sure aren't looking good for US universities, Wisconsin has it unusually bad. Decades of plummeting investment in higher education has left it among the US's 10 worst states. Fear of debt mean Wisconsin students are balking at paying for college, denting revenue even more. But what can Wisconsin universities do to drum up funding?
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has a plan. Its recruitment partnership with a Chinese education ministry agency is helping it reap millions in tuition dollars by creating a boarding school for Chinese students to learn English before enrolling at the university. The school, called Wisconsin International Academy (WIA), is hoping to convert an $8-million, 162-room Hilton hotel into a dorm for Chinese students. But the planning commission of Glendale, the Milwaukee suburb where the Hilton is based, is denying the application (pdf).
The Hilton deadlock hints at tensions that can arise as more and more of the US education system faces demand from wealthy Chinese parents. Rapidly rising living standards mean not only that more Chinese parents can afford US educations. They can afford to board school price tags—WIA costs $30,000-40,000/year—and college. As of 2011, around 24,000 Chinese high school-aged students were studying in the US; in 2008, there were almost none.
On the face of it, the Hilton plan seems broadly beneficial. UMW gets more tuition. Chinese parents get English-speaking, US degree-holding offspring. Cernet, the Chinese government subsidiary behind the deal, turns a tidy profit while freeing up more classroom seats in China. And the owners sell at above market value.
City of Glendale - Plan Commission What all the fuss is about.
But some of the 12,872 residents of Glendale are less thrilled. The owners are selling for personal reasons, but the hotel has 70% occupancy, and since it's the destination of choice for two big corporate parks, turning it into a dorm could cost nearby businesses customers. The hotel is “essential for our business,” wrote Jennifer Holt, a frequent visitor to their company's Glendale office, on Facebook.
The Hilton is also a favorite for hosting local weddings and other posh events. And most of all, it brings Glendale $250,000 a year in hotel room taxes.
A recent city council meeting exemplified the debates over Chinese investment, Matt Gibson, the boarding school's principal, pushed the positives. According to meeting minutes (pdf, p.15), Gibson noted that Glendale businesses like Swarovski, a luxury jewelry store, appreciated students not just for their behavior, but because they have “disposable income and they enjoy spending it.” Gibson also flagged that Chinese parents visit frequently and that “they are people of means” who often “bring along investors with them,” including one now interested in launching a high-end Chinese restaurant.
On the other hand, Glendale's mayor was worried about the Chinese government's involvement in the Hilton bid. Jian Sun, a WIA executive, said the investment came from Cermax Corp, a consortium of Chinese and American investors. Though there's some indication that Cernet may own Cermax, Sun assured the committee that “no single penny from the Chinese government” would be invested, according to the meeting minutes. Glendale will find out whether that satisfied city leaders after August 26, when the city council rules on the proposal.
When all else fails, you can always blame Bollywood.
At least that is what an Indian man accused of stalking women in Australia did in a court in Tasmania last week.
Sandesh Baliga, a 32-year-old security guard, said they learned from Bollywood movies that relentlessly pursuing women was the only way to woo them.
Baliga, who grew up in a remote, rural part of India,moved to Australia to study accounting and said they loved to watch Bollywood movies. In Australia, they were accused of stalking two women -- one for 18 months in 2012, and another for four months in 2013 -- by repeatedly calling, texting and approaching them. They even called themselves their “boyfriend.”
In court, Baliga pleaded guilty and said the male leads in Bollywood movies always got the women to say yes by doggedly chasing them. Their lawyer, Greg Barns, said in court that this was “quite normal behavior” for Indian men.
In the end, court magistrate Michael Hill accepted the argument that Baliga's cultural background had influenced their behavior and let them go on the condition of good behavior for the next five years.
Indian women's activist @kavita_krishnan tweeted:
In #Australia http://t.co/hSokjSd6A3 It's official. What's 'love' in Bollywood is what's stalking in the rest of the world. — Kavita Krishnan (@kavita_krishnan) January 29, 2015
In the unprecedented national uproar in India that followed the fatal gang rape of a young woman in a moving bus in 2012, many have questioned the rampant misogyny in Bollywood movies. The male protagonist is routinely shown harassing, chasing and forcing women to admit their love in the movies.
A recent U.N. report criticized Indian movies for their sexualization of women. In 2013, a film called 'Raanjhanaa' was criticized for glorifying stalking and harassment by the male lead.
Some movie stars have spoken against it as well.
Since the protest over the 2012 gang rape, movie actor Farhan Akhtar even began an campaign called MARD (Men Against Rape and Discrimination) and enlisted other stars. In their television chat show, actor Aamir Khan recently said that they were ashamed to have acted in movies that demean women.

A CHRISTIAN campaign group is launching a national network of safe houses for Muslim converts who face ostracism or violent reprisals for leaving their religion.
It says it knows of up to 1,100 former Muslims at risk in Britain but the true number could be 3,000.
Andrea Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern, which is organising the network, said: “We are motivated by a deep sense of love and compassion for those that feel trapped in a situation from which they cannot escape.
“The penalty for them at best is to be cut off from their family; at worst they face death. This is happening not just in Sudan and Nigeria but in east London. The government has failed to deal with the rise in…
Dog owner hires a digger to rescue missing Jack Russell from disused pipe after they became stuck for four days
Lulu went into drainage tunnel during a walk with owner Gina Kaiser
Ms Kaiser hired a digger but the fire brigade stepped in and took over
Drainage pipe has been closed at both ends to prevent it happening again
A dog trapped underground for four days in a drainage tunnel was rescued when its owner hired a digger to get them out.
Lulu the Jack Russell disappeared down the unused pipe last Friday at Boveney Lock in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, when owner Gina Kaiser took them for a walk.
But after darting into the 60cm-wide pipe under a car park they got stuck when they were unable to turn around because of rubble narrowing the tube.
Scroll down for video
Crew Manager Pete Skinner is pictured emerging with Lulu the Jack Russell from an opening cut into the pipe Ms Kaiser hired a digger to get to their pet but a passerby saw what was happening and contacted the fire brigade Rescue workers dig a square piece of land where they believe the puppy to be stuck in the drainage tunnel
Ms Kaiser called the RSPCA but was told if they could hear Lulu barking the likelihood was they would find a way out of the disused pipe.
They advised them to wait it out but as the days passed they became more and more anxious.
Lulu, aged five, barked non-stop for four days and kept themselves alive by drinking the trickle of water collected at the bottom of the pipe.
Firefighters said there was a risk of the situation becoming hazardous so they stepped in to help with the rescue
Getting desperate, Ms Kaiser decided to hire their own JCB to cut the dog free.
However, a passerby alerted the local fire service and they stepped in and launched a six-hour operation to rescue Lulu.
A five-strong team used the digger, cutting equipment, spades and shovels to excavate a wide hole to get to the pipe which was more than eight feet underground.
They then smashed their way into the drain and lifted Lulu free.
Social worker Ms Kaiser said: 'The fire service have been brilliant, it shows there are some really good people about.'
Fire brigade station manager Doug Gruchy said: 'Lulu's owner had organised their own search, but the situation was in danger of becoming hazardous.
'We took the decision to carry out this rescue because of our concern for the safety of their search party as well as for Lulu's welfare.
'We are obviously delighted that it has had a happy ending.'
They added: 'It's quite understandable that an owner, when faced with a situation like this, will want to go to extraordinary lengths to save a pet.
'But our advice to pet owners is to contact the RSPCA in the event of an incident of this type. They will then liaise with us if specialist rescue skills and equipment become necessary.'
Firefighters have now closed off the entrances to the pipe and an adjacent one to prevent a repeat of the drama.
They eventually managed to get to the tunnel underneath about four feet of earth
A rescuer had to get right into the tunnel to pull Lulu free. They had survived by lapping up water that trickled underneath them Here they come: Looking remarkably clean and calm, Lulu emerges from the pipe after a successful rescue
Lulu licking their lips at the thought of an imminent feed, pictured with their owner and a smiling team of firefighters
Still licking their lips, an excitable Lulu bears the the muddy paw marks that suggest they scraped away at the pipe walls but to no avail. Thank goodness for mummy and that digger!
It all becomes a bit much for Ms Kaiser as the four days' emotion finally takes it toll and they hold Lulu tight
Not letting them out of their sight, Ms Kaiser keeps a firm grip on their beloved pet after a tearful reunion and remarkable rescue. Home James!
Reddit announced that they're doing away with a number of subs and users who promote hate speech and violence. This comes on the heels of the news story that one of their users, an ardent Trump supporter, murdered their father.
This shouldn't come as any surprise. Pro-Trump subs on the site have allowed and even encouraged violence and hate speech towards liberals, minorities, and anyone they believe to be their political opponents. Toxic users have tried to spread their hatred into other parts of the site.
Moderators of those subs have found little help from Reddit admins, who have taken a hands-off attitude towards that behavior. Every time there is a terrorist attack, racist users flood every story with hatred towards Muslims and immigrants, even when the perpetrator turns out to be a white person like the one in the Las Vegas massacre.
Now when the site admins say they will address these toxic users and their ideology, I can't help but laugh and think it is a bunch of bullshit.
This is the statement from Reddit:
Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. This applies to ALL content on Reddit, including memes, CSS/community styling, flair, subreddit names, and usernames. We understand that enforcing this policy may often require subjective judgment, so all of the usual caveats apply with regard to content that is newsworthy, artistic, educational, satirical, etc, as mentioned in the policy. Context is key. The policy is posted in the help center here. (Reddit's announcement.)
This seems like a bold move by Reddit to counter hate speech, fake news, and calls to violence – but it really isn't. The site has been the home for right-wing trolls, sexists, conspiracy fanatics and racists for years. Every once in awhile, they announce what sounds like a crackdown, ban a few people, and go back to business as usual.
I've been active on Reddit for years under a variety of usernames. It has been manipulated by Russian interests to promote propaganda against the West, a scandal that was quietly handled by unpaid volunteer moderators in large subs like /r/news, and ignored by others like /r/politics.
Reddit has yet to ban /r/the_Donald, the biggest source of Russian misinformation and promotion of right-wing ideology which includes calls for violence against Americans who do not support Trump. They probably won't, because those subscribers are very active, likely with Russian influence, which drives traffic and ad revenue.
I'm still waiting on them to address the rampant racism, sexism, and hatred on Reddit. It's one thing to issue a public statement and kill off some low-hanging fruit. It's another one to address the real elephant in the room. I'm not going to hold my breath.

NRL TEAMS ROUND 22 — Roosters co-captain Boyd Cordner is still another week away from making their NRL return.
The backrower hasn't been sighted since Origin III as he's been rested due to a chronic knee injury.
Ryan Matterson retains their place in the starting side for Sunday's game against Manly.
“Aiming for Melbourne next week,” Cordner told Fox Sports.
“It's a bit unfortunate. I've been aiming to get back as soon as I can.

“It would've been nice to play this weekend against Manly but the medical staff at the Roosters thought it would be a good idea to have another week.
“The calf is sweet. It's pulled up fine. During that Origin game I re-aggravated an old injury in my right knee. It's been a slow but it's coming along nicely and I'm looking forward to getting back on the field.”
Meanwhile, Penrith is sweating on the fitness of captain Matt Moylan and representative centre Dean Whare.
The pair have been named in the extended Panthers squad and are racing the clock to return to the side.

“I start back running today and see how it goes. It's feeling really good. We'll see how it responds to running today” Moylan said prior to training on Monday.
“I just want to make sure I've done enough work and that I don't go back out there and tweak it again. Having not done it before, I didn't know what to expect when I first come back.
“I just want to make sure that when I get into a game situation, I don't really tweak it again.”

BLOG WITH PHIL PRIOR FOR THE LATEST TEAM AND FANTASY NEWS:
Occult Symbolism In The Number 12 prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" ? By James Donahue February 2006 Numbers have a language of their own in the occult world. They become a universal language whereby all things are in some way connected. In our examination of the number 12 we first must look at the fact that two digits are represented here; the 1 and the 2. To the occultist these numbers are immediately added so that 1 plus 2 equals 3. Thus the number 12 also has a second occult meaning in the number 3. The three might signify a manifestation in a third dimension. The number three is the first sacred or perfect number. It represents the Pagan Trinity. It is represented geometrically in the triangle and spiritually as the Third Eye of Hinduism. Occultists multiply and add three to other sacred numbers to create new numbers. People born with the Number three as their destiny number identify with the Emperor Tarot. They excel at writing, speaking, singing, acting, litigating and teaching. They possess a natural ability to uplift others with words and thought. They are good leaders, speak with authority and reason, and are usually very organized. It is said that occultists often use the triple numbers 333 as a secret number representing the dreaded 666. But we have heard that the real reason is that this number, 333, is an occult symbol for Choronzon, the dreaded spirit of chaos. This entity also is known as the spirit of dissolution and Lord of Hallucinations. Everyone who comes in contact with Choronzon falls into ruin. The demon is said to create confusion of thought and turn people insane. Returning to the number 12, we find this number is linked to the Hanged Man Tarot. Unlike the Emperor, this card reflects a time of stalemate. Energies can hang in limbo and when the card appears in a reading, change is usually recommended to get things in motion once again. Twelve is a higher octave of the number three. The number appears within a multi-dimensional grid or matrix of pyramids within such images as the Tree of Life, the astrological signs of the zodiac wheel and the alchemy wheel of time. Humans have used 12 as an ancient standard for measurement. We have twelve months in a year and twelve hours on a clock. We measure by the foot, which contains 12 inches and sell by the dozen, the gross, or shilling, all representing numbers of 12. There are 12 fruits of the Cosmic Tree, the pagans believed there were 12 days of return to chaos at the Winter Solstice, 12 days of Yuletide and Christmas and the Chinese recognize 12 Terrestrial Branches in time. Religious belief systems utilize the number 12. Jesus, Buddha and Mithra each had 12 disciples, the Moslems say there were 12 descendants of Allah, and the Hebrews say there were 12 Tribes of Israel. The Christians mark 12 fruits of the spirit and 12 gates and foundation stones of the prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" ? Holy City . The Celtics count 12 paladins of Charlemagne, and King Arthur's court had 12 knights at the Round Table. In the Book of the Revelation, we see the number 12 in constant use. There is a woman with a crown of 12 stars on their head. The New Jerusalem has 12 gates and on the gates are written the names of the 12 tribes. The wall of the city had 12 foundations and on them were the names of the 12 apostles. We also see the numbers 144 and 12,000 which are multiples of 12, 1,260 days, 42 months, time, times and half a time, three and a half days, a description of periods of persecution. There are some strange reasons for the use of 12 in English measurements. For example the foot is the approximate length of an average person's foot. Yet the decision to square it off at exactly 12 inches seems to come from unknown origins. Fourteenth Century King Edward II ruled that an inch should be three grains of barley placed lengthwise end-to-end. Thus the measurement of the inch appears to have had something to do with deciding on the exact length of a foot. Yet the number 12 comes up in so many of the sacred records, as well as the tools we use in our daily lives, like clocks and the purchase of baked goods, its roots lie deep in the collective unconsciousness. There is sacred geometry there. That the number is divisible by three, and when multiplied by the sacred numbers becomes an important number in itself.

Between 1974 and 2004, the Cincinnati Reds were fortunate to be able to pencil in the names of Dave Concepcion or Barry Larkin at the shortstop position nearly every Opening Day. Now take a look at the group of names above. You may have surmised that those are the shortstops who have started for the Reds on Opening Day since Larkin's retirement.
Yes, the stench is nearly overwhelming.
This year, Paul Janish is expected to take their turn at the most important defensive position on the diamond for Cincinnati, and their performance is one of the keys to the Reds' chances to repeat as NL Central champs.
In one important way, Janish presents an immediate upgrade to the list of has-beens at the top of this post. Every single one of the shortstops above were poor defensively with very little range (although a couple had been good in their younger days). Janish is the opposite; Soft-J has a reputation as an elite defender and they should help make the Reds stronger up the middle than they have been in quite some time.
There are questions about Janish, however, and those revolve primarily around whether or not they will hit enough to merit a starting spot. Here's the way FanGraphs sees it:
Janish has posted 2.0 WAR in their first two significant stints in the Major Leagues. Their bat hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been anything stellar, but since their disastrous first stint in 2007 (42 wRC+ in 89 PAs), Janish has shown moderate patience and good contact. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much pop, and some bad luck and a fly ball heavy batted ball profile has led to low BABIPs. It is those two factors which have largely driven their poor batting lines to date. Between 2009 and 2010, Janish compiled -15 batting runs, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s with a BABIP in the .260s. Despite their issues with fly balls, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to imagine Janish will continue to have such poor results on balls in play. Their .260/.338/.385 line in 2010 appears to be pretty representative of JanishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abilities, although probably with a SLG closer to .360. Their minor league numbers are poor, but the two parts of their game that have played the best in the majors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ walk rate and contact rate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are the quickest to stabilize. 600 plate appearances still isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a huge sample, but for both statistics it is above the reliability thresholds stated here. Their bat probably only plays at shortstop, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a problem for Janish. According to Baseball America, Janish has Ã¢â‚¬Å“nearly flawless footwork, soft hands and a plus arm.Ã¢â‚¬Â UZR was insane over Janish in 2009, rating them at +11 in only half a season. That seems outrageous, but DRS and TZL nearly completely agree. They wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite as impressive in 2010, possibly due to splitting time between SS and 3B in the small sample, but they were still above average.
The MARCEL projections see Janish hitting at a .237/.313/.362 rate. That's certainly not great, but it's better than the numbers Orlando Cabrera posted last year. If Janish plays defense the way everyone expects, he's a good bet to be an average (or slightly above-average) shortstop. There is value in that.
Of course, we can't discuss Janish without discussing the Edgar Renteria factor. Cincinnati signed Renteria in the off-season, and GM Walt Jocketty says that Renteria will be Janish's backup. Most of the Loyal Citizens of the Nation believe that Renteria will be named the starter at some point (see the poll on this page). At this point, I'm just going to express some skepticism and I will pretend that Janish is going to be the full-time starter, since that's what Jocketty continues to insist. Janish will have to play well early in order to convince the Reds that they can really let them play this time around, instead of making yet another switch to the over-the-hill veteran shortstop.
I think Janish would have been a good starter for the Reds last year (instead of Cabrera, and they were a better choice than Gonzalez the previous year), and I continue to believe that he's the best bet for this team. It will be nice to see a shortstop every day who can field the position with some flash. Of course, perhaps the most value that Janish can bring to the Reds is that he's an excellent stopgap, a cheap bridge to the probable shortstop of the future.
That shortstop is very likely Zack Cozart. Cozart will start the 2011 season at AAA Louisville, but there are some within the Cincinnati organization that expect Cozart to be the shortstop for the Reds very soon. There is a reason why people are high on Cozart. Take a look at what <a href="Baseball Prospectus“>Baseball Prospectus had to say about the kid:
Just when it seemed safe to declare Cozart's 2008 power surge dead, they set a career high in homers. The additional power came at the cost of some plate discipline, so the overall package wasn't more productive than the 2009 model, but the righty held their own despite climbing to the minor-league ladder's highest rung. As one of the best defensive shortstops in any team's system, Cozart doesn't have to excel with the stick to get the call, but he's done plenty to dispel their former all-glove reputation, and might well have surpassed Orlando Cabrera at the plate last season had they gotten the chance. Edgar Renteria should take plenty of pictures of their first season as the Reds' starting shortstop, because they likely won't get another.
High praise, and I agree that Cozart has a good chance to be the starter in 2012 (whether taking over from Renteria or Janish). Of course, even if Cozart becomes the shortstop Reds fans have been waiting for, we still have to give them time to prepare.
In the meantime, Paul Janish is a good bet to provide some good play at shortstop for Cincinnati. If Soft-J is able to man the position adequately, the Reds will be in good shape as they hunt for a second consecutive playoff appearance. He's the X-Factor.
JACK OHMAN wasn't just surprised by their satirical target's response. They were stunned.
“Not just by the massive response,” Ohman tells Comic Riffs, “but to the willful misinterpretation of the cartoon.”
That willful misinterpretation, the Sacramento Bee journalist says, was by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who in the cartoon (published last Thursday) is depicted as saying ”...Business is booming in Texas!” before a banner that reads: “Low Tax! Low Regs!” In the cartoon's second “payoff” panel, Ohman renders the recent explosion at the fertilizer plant in West, Tex., that killed at least 15 people.
“Gov. Perry was being criticized in Texas and elsewhere for the Texas regulatory climate,” Ohman tells us Monday, “and they found a way to change the conversation in the media cycle.”
“I have never seen anything like this in my 35-year career,” Ohman notes. “Not just in reaction to my work, but to anyone else's.
A day after the cartoon ran in the Bee, the paper published a Letter to the Editor from Perry, who demanded an apology. The letter read:
“It was with extreme disgust and disappointment I viewed your recent cartoon. While I will always welcome healthy policy debate, I won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths of my fellow Texans and our fellow Americans.
“Additionally, publishing this on the very day our state and nation paused to honor and mourn those who died only compounds the pain and suffering of the many Texans who lost family and friends in this disaster. The Bee owes the community of West, Texas, an immediate apology for your detestable attempt at satire.”
“They wanted to divert attention from policies that may have helped the explosion to occur,” Ohman, a 2012 Pulitzer finalist and 2013 Herblock Prize finalist, tells Comic Riffs. “That's what the cartoon was about, and they know it. This wasn't about my cartoon.”
. (courtesy of JACK OHMAN / Sacramento Bee /.)
In replying to Perry's letter shortly after, the Bee's editorial page editor, Stuart Leavenworth, echoed Ohman's sentiment, publishing this response:
“It is unfortunate that Gov. Perry, and some on the blogosphere, [has] attempted to interpret the cartoon as being disrespectful of the victims of this tragedy. As Ohman has made clear on their blog, they have complete empathy for the victims and people living by the plant. What they find offensive is a governor who would gamble with the lives of families by not pushing for the strongest safety regulations. Perry's letter is an attempt to distract people from that message.”
Ohman tells Comic Riffs: “My editors and the publisher of The Bee could not be stronger in their support.”
In defending their cartoon on their Bee blog, Ohman pointed out, in part:
“The Texas chemical plant had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006. That's seven years ago. You may have read in the news that Gov. Perry, during their business recruiting trips to California and Illinois, generally described their state as free from high taxes and burdensome regulation. One of the burdensome regulations they neglected to mention was the fact that their state hadn't really gotten around to checking out that fertilizer plant. ...
“Gov. Perry's name and the explosion have been linked for several news cycles. I didn't just make this all up. It's out there. There is a rather stunning report about all this on ProPublica, the investigative news website. I invite you to read it.”
[RELATED: Texas House committee to hold hearing on explosion Wednesday]
Texas's lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst, reportedly urged that the Bee fire Ohman. According to Fox News, Dewhurst said: “I think it's reprehensible for a member of the media to sit in safety and mock such a profound tragedy regardless of any `point' they are trying to make.”
The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists — of which Ohman is a member — supported Ohman's “powerful cartoon” and decried Perry's and Dewhurst's actions as “intimidation.” The industry group's statement said, in part:
“The Ohman cartoon represents the finest traditions of both American political cartooning and our freedom of the press. On the other hand the Texas governor's response demanding a retraction and an apology, represents the worst impulses of those who have no respect for our most basic and fundamental right to free speech. ...
“The attempt to intimidate a journalist for being critical of the government ... is what should be condemned. This sort of intimidation of journalists is, at its root, just plain un-American.”
Ohman appreciated the support of their colleagues. “I was very moved by the AAEC statement,” they say.
The AAEC's president, Politico cartoonist Matt Wuerker, shared the group's opinion personally, as well.
“The attempt to intimidate a journalist for being critical of the government, particularly the call on the part of the Texas lieutenant governor to have [Ohman] lose their job, is the sort of thing you see in banana republics, and has no place in the United States,” says the Pulitzer-winning Wuerker, who is also a board member of the Cartoon Rights Network, which deals with rights' issues overseas.
“We're lucky that 25 years ago, the Hustler v. Falwell decision by the U.S. Supreme Court closed the door to the sort of onerous lawsuits [that] leaders in places like South Africa and Ecuador used to intimidate cartoonists they'd like to shut up,” Wuerker tells Comic Riffs. “That legal precedent is a very thin line between our own remarkable blessings of an unfettered and free press, and those countries where journalists get regularly bullied by their governments.”
Wuerker noted that in China, they believe, a cartoonist expressing Ohman's opinion on this issue would be hailed as a hero.
“It's the job of political cartoonists to be provocative and take on tough issues,” Wuerker adds. “It's not the job of governors and others to try and shut them up.”
Here's Comic Riffs's full Q&A with Ohman:
MICHAEL CAVNA: Did you anticipate the strong reaction from Perry's camp?
JACK OHMAN: Absolutely not. I was stunned. Not just by the massive response, but to the willful misinterpretation of the cartoon. Gov. Perry was being criticized in Texas and elsewhere for the Texas regulatory climate, and they found a way to change the conversation in the media cycle.
Cartoonists frequently juxtapose a tragic situation with a politician's own words and policies. We live in a communications culture where a meme can be manufactured, exponentially amplified by social media, and then picked up by the mainstream media. This is what happened here. They wanted to divert attention from policies that may have helped the explosion to occur. That's what the cartoon was about, and they know it. This wasn't about my cartoon.
MC: What sort of reaction are getting from readers — be they in Sacramento, Texas or all points in between?
JO: After the initial blow-up from the conservative blogosphere, the reactions I've read have been a more way more positive than negative.
[Update: Here's one Letter to the Editor that the Bee published Monday: “Cartoon went too far...”]
MC: Does this crack your top-10 over the years as the Strongest Reaction From A Public Official?
JO: Not only does it crack my top-10, I have never seen anything like this in my 35-year career. Not just in reaction to my work, but to anyone else's. I would exclude the Danish cartoonist. I think the fact that there is currently a very strong California/Texas feud going on, instigated by Gov. Perry, has a lot to do with it. It's just politics.
[Note: Perry reportedly has traveled to California as part of an effort to lure jobs to Texas.]
MC: Perry demanded an apology from The Bee. ... Do you know [whether] the paper plans to [apologize]?
JO: The Bee responded on Saturday. There was no apology in that statement.
MC: Do you feel supported by your colleagues at The Bee, and in the industry?
JO: Absolutely. I was very moved by the AAEC statement, and my editors and the publisher of The Bee could not be stronger in their support.

The Melissa King assault case was an incident in Cleveland, Ohio when personal animosity between two girls led to an alleged attack by eighteen black and Hispanic youths aged between eight and fifteen on a thirteen-year-old white girl named Melissa King. Of the eighteen children, six were convicted. Although there were allegations that this was part of a customary "Beat up a White Kid" day, both prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that the incident arose from a vendetta between two girls.
2003 case [ edit ]
On May 1, 2003, school officials and students at Wilbur Wright Middle School separately notified police that "a large fight" was planned for after school near the intersection of Almira Avenue and West 110th street in Cleveland, Ohio.[1][2] Initially, it was believed that police arrived as the attack was under way.[3] However, two police cars were there prior to the attack and when school let out, they saw a large group of students walking in the street on West 110th. From their automobiles, the police warned them to walk on the sidewalk.[1]
Some of the students moved to block the police cars as part of the pre-planned attack.[1][2][4] With the police kept at a distance, a pack of twelve girls and six boys, ages 9 through 15, began to run towards Melissa King, a 13-year-old white girl who was a student at Wilbur Wright and was walking home with two friends.[5][1][2]
On reaching King, one girl grabbed King's hair from behind and yanked them to the ground.[6] Then the black and Hispanic youths, 17 of whom were students at Wilbur Wright,[6] beat, kicked, and choked her.[3] As they pummeled and scratched at King, the attackers called their "honky", "white trash", and "white bitch."[1][7][8] One attacker was overheard saying, "I hit them and got my stomp in."[2]
By the time police broke up the attack,[6] King had suffered serious injuries to their head, arms, face, neck, back, and an eye and experienced dizziness and blackouts that their mother claimed required repeated visits to the hospital.[1][3][9] When the attackers were asked separately by the police officers why the victim was jumped, each one stated, "It's May Day!"[1] They each went on to explain that May Day "is the day blacks beat on whites" and is known as "beat up a white kid day."[1][2][3][10] Others familiar with the attack said it wasn't personal, but that it was merely in keeping with the May Day tradition where minority children get a "free shot" at white children simply because of their race.[11] However, defense lawyers and prosecutors both agreed that the attack sprang from a personal vendetta between Melissa and one girl. This girl testified that Melissa had overheard them talking to a school counselor after they were sexually abused and attempted suicide, and claimed Melissa had spread gossip about this.[citation needed] Within a few days of the attack, Wilbur Wright school responded by suspending five of the eighteen attackers from school for ten days.[6]
2003 fall-out [ edit ]
When the attack was publicized a day later in The Plain Dealer, more than 100 readers contacted the newspaper to confirm that the May Day ritual had been alive and well for years.[12] Many in their 20s recalled staying home sick from school on May Day in the 1990s or hurrying home to avoid getting hurt.[12] Some teachers did not give homework that day because they knew attendance would be down.[12] Although annual assaults on white children by minorities is rooted in certain public schools on Cleveland's West Side,[6][13] the event may have multiple origins. For example, one man recalled that when they served in the military, many of their friends reported, participated in, or became victims of this annual ritual.[12]
In June 2003, the juvenile justice unit of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office filed felonious assault and aggravated riot juvenile charges against the eighteen attackers.[3][14] Noting that the attack was some sort of May Day ritual with the "focus to beat up a white kid," the juvenile justice unit also charged the attackers with ethnic intimidation—a hate-crimes law.[3] In July, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Joseph F. Russo entered not guilty pleas and appointed lawyers for the youth, and issued arrest warrants for the four who failed to attend the court hearing.[15]
Judge Russo ended the trial on October 2003 with six convictions.[16] These six individuals admitted aggravated rioting, and two of those admitted to felonious assault. Judge Russo said that testimony from prosecution witnesses including Melissa was too conflicting, inconsistent and sometimes obviously false to prove the culpability of four defendants beyond reasonable doubt.[citation needed] However they concluded that "based on the evidence I've heard, May Day is reality and the evidence was overwhelming that this was an attack based on May Day and that the victim was chosen because they were white."[5] In drawing their conclusion, Judge Russo suggested that white students in Cleveland's integrated public schools have reason to fear assaults by minorities in so-called May Day attacks every May 1.[5][17]

The university campus of the 21st century is here–and it's a far cry from brick buildings draped in ivy huddled around a cloistered quad. Instead, its landscaping is designed to soak up rain. Its structures are designed to maximize resource efficiency. And its buildings are meant to nurture real-world innovations, in some cases through architecture itself.

This is Cornell Tech, a hotly anticipated $2 billion campus on Roosevelt Island, a narrow strip of land on the East River between Manhattan and Queens. When I first arrived for its dedication last week, what immediately stood out was how welcoming the entire campus felt: The pathway leading from the street to the campus's center felt like a grand boulevard. The buildings themselves–with their asymmetrical facades, finishes that caught the light, and individual personas–were the complete opposite of the institutional aesthetic with which higher ed is often associated. Even more impressive is how the campus relates to the city itself. Roosevelt Island is physically separate from Manhattan and Queens, but the campus frames views of the skylines of both boroughs as if to remind visitors that they are still very much a part of the city. It's a rare vantage point from which to see so much of N.Y.C., and it's symbolic of Cornell Tech's ambitions to become the intellectual and entrepreneurial hub of New York–a Silicon Valley of the East–while offering an ad hoc incubator for forward-thinking design strategies that could have ripple effects throughout the city. A Super-Efficient Building Boom While the architecture on Cornell Tech's campus is visually striking and distinctive–a welcome change in a city with a few too many generic glass towers in its skyline–their environmental creds are the real driver behind their design. The first phase of Cornell Tech's masterplan includes the Bloomberg Center, a Morphosis-designed net-zero academic building wrapped in an iridescent green-tinted aluminum skin; the Bridge, a faceted glass building that contains offices for startups and students designed by Weiss/Manfredi; and The House, a dormitory and the world's tallest structure to earn Passive House certification. Passive House design–ultra-strict construction criteria that result in significantly lower energy consumption and heating/cooling costs–has been around since the 1980s, but it's mostly been applied to single-family homes. Cornell's 26-story-tall dorm and faculty housing designed by Handel Architects and constructed by The Hudson Companies is a new demonstration of how the criteria could be adapted to high-density, multi-family structures–particularly relevant in dense urban centers like New York. Building a first-of-its kind structure involved investing in new construction techniques. To achieve high energy efficiency, Passive Houses have extra insulation to prevent heat loss and gain and complex mechanical systems that turn heat in the air into energy. Handel Architects had to design heat-exchange systems that would work at the scale of the high-rise building, while Hudson Companies had to train contractors to build to these new specifications. Meanwhile, New York City's Department of Buildings had to grant code variances to allow for the new techniques to be implemented. All of these efforts took more time, money, and risk than a conventional high-rise. But now that the knowledge is embedded in the city–from the scale of contractors to regulations–it's already taking off.

“We've started to see a shift take place in the development industry,” says Arianna Sacks Rosenberg, senior project manager at The Hudson Companies. “[The city] said, ‘If this works here, it will stand as a model for other buildings.' We saw that happen and the codes change, which is really exciting.” The city is embracing Passive House design for tall buildings, and is now issuing RFPs for publicly funded architecture constructed to these standards. The city is especially interested in applications for low-income housing, and Handel Architects is submitting designs for consideration. (Passive Houses must adhere to a strict 60-40 ratio of solid to glass surfaces for energy purposes, which wouldn't fly for most luxury real estate buyers.) “If [we] can demonstrate that [Passive House design] is feasible for low-income housing, that is a humongous game changer,” Deborah Moelis, senior associate at Handel Architects, says. “Cornell Tech is kind of a beta test.” A “Post-Manhattan” Era New York is composed of five boroughs, but because of its role as the city's economic center Manhattan has historically received the most attention when it comes to investment and public transit. That's beginning to change, and Cornell Tech is emblematic of that post-Manhattan thinking, a philosophy Colin Koop–a design director at Skidmore Owings & Merrill, the architecture firm behind Cornell Tech's master plan–says is on the rise. “As New York City grows, it becomes less reliant on Manhattan,” Koop says. “It's a fully realized set of boroughs. . . . It's not just a heart and a periphery.” Cornell Tech isn't the only city project that represents this approach. New York University is opening a $500 million campus in downtown Brooklyn. The city is investing heavily in redeveloping Industry City and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the East River waterfront is receiving new parks, ferry service, and mixed-use development. Long Island City, in Queens, expects a startup boom directly tied to Cornell Tech. Development is typically viewed (usually accurately) as a direct line to gentrification, but Koop believes that a less Manhattan-centric approach to urbanism will make the city more equitable and livable for all income levels–if the city leverages the land it owns effectively.

Koop explains by pointing out a dichotomy in urban planning between the “highest” and the “best” land uses. The highest use of land is typically equated with monetary value. Luxury housing and development almost always have the highest returns. The “best” use is more subjective and depends on the philosophical perspective of the person making decisions. For example, are a few acres of city-owned waterfront land better suited for condos, or wetlands that can help with resiliency? The former will certainly generate more money in the short term, but the latter will potentially benefit more of the city in the long run. Cornell Tech is built on 12 acres of city-owned land, but the buildings are owned by private developers. While the city could have sold Roosevelt Island to the highest bidder, it instead decided to use the land to better prepare itself for a future, tech-based economy through education. The campus has a partnership with the public school on the island to help students through co-developing a tech curriculum and hosting field trips, and is expected to generate 8,000 jobs and spark $23 billion of growth. The campus itself is open to the public, and is meant to feel transparent and welcoming. The goal? To invest in the city as a whole. “The ‘highest' and ‘best' together is something that Cornell hopefully represents,” Koop says. “It's more beneficial to the neighborhood than luxury towers–and nothing against them–but what [Roosevelt Island] needed was a more diverse set of uses. It already has a lot of houses. It didn't have higher education, a hotel, and offices. All of those put together is an exciting thing to have. It would be great for the city to think equally intelligent at all of its sites.” New York has over 43,000 acres of city-owned land, which amounts to roughly the size of Brooklyn. About 20% of that land is classified as having “no current use.” As the city grows, policymakers will have to figure out what to do with these assets and what will best benefit the city as a whole–reconciling the “highest” and “best” uses as Cornell Tech has. Resilience That Any City Could Adopt Landscape is a major element of Cornell Tech, and the campus feels strikingly open. It's more like a public park than a university–and that's by design. The university wants people from outside its orbit to come to the campus. Picnicking on Columbia's quad might feel a bit strange if you aren't a student; not so at Cornell Tech. A central walkway cuts through the campus–dubbed the “Tech Walk”– and buildings flank the main path. Smaller walkways lead to the individual buildings, like veins from an artery. The entire campus is car-fee. There are ample benches, trees for shade, outdoor tables and chairs, and mini “landscape rooms” in front of the buildings. For now, there are sprawling lawns, which will be open space until the campus's next growth spurt, which is expected in 2027.

The invisible hand guiding the design of the campus, though, is sustainability and resiliency. How the design achieves this, especially when it comes to the landscape design by James Corner Field Operations, is subtle and often hidden completely. The site is elevated above 500-year flood levels, which helps protect it from storm surges and sea level rise. SOM's master plan called for a gently sloped site that's tallest in the very center, which naturally channels water toward landscaped areas filled with a special mix of soil, mulch, plants, and gravel that that filters and retains rainwater. Field Operations riffed on the area's geological characteristics, like dolomite boulders and natural vegetation that's both drought tolerant and can withstand inundation along the edges of the East River. Much of the pavement is permeable and wicks water away from the surface of walkways so there are no puddles. Underground cisterns hold the excess water for future use, and if too much water accumulates, it's clean enough to discharge into the river. The entire campus is essentially a huge sponge that soaks up stormwater and repurposes it for irrigation or gray water. “They're very low-key sustainable practices that, in a way aren't innovative in and of themselves, but are innovative in a city environment,” Karen Tamir, a principal and landscape architect at Field Operations, says. While Cornell Tech's non-mechanical approach to stormwater can't be replicated on every site, Tamir believes that it has potential for waterfront locations. In the past, Field Operations has incorporated biofiltration-based stormwater management into its waterfront projects, but Cornell Tech was the first to not use any mechanical filtration. This passive, porous design approach is something Tamir believes every site could adopt. As New York City continues to reorient itself around its postindustrial waterfronts while reevaluating how to use them to fight the rising tides–like public parks that double as sea level rise protections–Cornell Tech's “no-tech” stormwater management strategy might see wider adoption. “Sea levels are rising, there are more and more hardscaped surfaces, and larger stormwater volumes,” Tamir says. “It's a really important part of any landscape to bear some of the brunt and have functionality–but not at the expense of beauty.” Save

Google's artificial intelligence studio Deep Mind has created a computer program that can play Pong. Here is why that feat is more impressive than it sounds
So a computer program has learned how to play classic Atari games. Big deal. I mean, they're just big blocks of pixels pushing smaller blocks of pixels around a screen, right?
Yet somehow, the UK artificial intelligence specialist Deep Mind, bought last year by Google for £240m, is extremely excited about the fact that it has developed an AI agent capable of learning how to play Space Invaders. I learned how to play Space Invaders in a cafe in Blackpool when I was six. But Google hasn't acquired me. What's going on?
Google develops computer program capable of learning tasks independently Read more
The thing is, classic Atari games such as Space Invaders, Pong and Breakout were, despite their visual limitations, much more complex than our modern minds give them credit for. Indeed, many of these games set in place the fundamental mechanics that modern titles are still utilising – and they are deceptively deep, even for a Deep Mind AI gamer.
It turns out the Deep Mind program fared very well against titles that allowed it to learn systems through simple trial and error such as Video Pinball and Breakout. However, it failed spectacularly at games that required the participants to build a mental map of the level and develop long-term strategies, or that required the mastery of different skillsets, such as the more complex shooters Zaxxon and Gravitar.
However, learning to play and master any of these games is a significant feat, despite their chunky aesthetics. Here are four classic Atari titles and why they're not quite as basic as they appear.
Pong
Designed by electrical engineer Al Alcorn and launched as an arcade machine in 1972, Atari's legendary bat and ball simulation, is widely considered the most basic interactive electronic game possible. Indeed, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell once said to Alcorn: “I want to make a game that any drunk in any bar can play.”
But Pong is actually a very important early example of game physics - the ball reacting to surfaces in different ways. When it hits a wall, it simply rebounds at a mirror-opposite angle.
However, each of the bats is actually divided into eight sections, each providing a slighting different angle of return. Therefore players are able to develop strategies, planning the return gradient so that the opponent is unable to quickly guess where the ball will return to, leaving them stranded in the wrong part of the screen. Consequently, players – or indeed computer programs – with a knowledge of projectile displacement physics have a distinct advantage.
Breakout
Created as a single-player version of Pong, Atari's wall-breaking classic was designed by Bushnell, with help from Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs who would, of course, later go on to found Apple. Players simply use a bat at the bottom of the screen to knock a ball into rows of coloured bricks, smashing anything it hits. Once again, the bat has different impact zones that affect the angle of the bounce.
Extra depth comes from the fact that the ball speeds up when the player reaches the upper layers of the walls, and then the bat shrinks to half its size when the ball finally hits the top wall. This is an early example of gameplay balance, with a system that increases the level of challenge as the player begins to excel. The fiendishly compulsive “tidying up” format of the game would later become a staple of the puzzle genre (see Tetris).
Space Invaders
Originally devised by Tomohiro Nishikado, a designer at Japanese arcade company Taito, Space Invaders is - alongside Pac-Man - one of the best-known video games of all time. Players shoot at waves of aliens as they descend to Earth, occasionally blasting a UFO as it whizzes across the top of the display.
Seemingly simple, the game was one of the first to introduce a smooth difficulty curve, the invaders speeding up as they get closer. Incredibly, this was actually a bug: the archaic processor was able to handle the movement more efficiently when there were fewer objects on screen. But Nishikado kept it.
Alongside the cowboy shoot-'em-up Gun Fight, Space Invaders (which was later ported to the Atari 2600 console) also popularised the “cover” mechanic, providing a row of destructible barriers for the player to hide behind. It is a feature that would later be brought to more complex action adventures such as Grand Theft Auto and Gears of War.
Indeed, Hideo Kojima, the creator of the multimillion-selling Metal Gear Solid series credited Space Invaders with inventing the “stealth” game genre, as players could sneak from barrier to barrier evading the attention – and bullets – of the extraterrestrial enemies.
Asteroids
Created using monochrome “vector” graphics by Atari coders Ed Logg and Lyle Rains, Asteroids has players controlling a tiny ship as it blasts passing space rocks. Once again, however, the basic set-up hides a complex challenge. The ship itself is piloted using thrust and inertia, an intricate physics system, that adds a significant skill factor to the multi-directional movement.
The game also exhibits a clever difficulty curve: when larger asteroids are blasted they split up into faster moving rocks, considerably increasing the challenge. And it experiments with contrasting AI enemies. Two different flying saucers can appear on screen – a large one that fires inaccurately, and a smaller one that is much more deadly.
Released in 1979, Asteroids was a smash hit, selling more than 70,000 arcade machines. Players were so addicted to its merging of simple visuals with intense action that they began to work out and exploit its systemic features. A good Asteroids player knows that leaving a single slow moving rock on screen and using it as a barrier from which to blast saucers is the way to huge high scores. It's a technique known as “lurking” and its one of the earliest example of players gaming the system for tactical advantage.
A 51-year-old man was charged after they allegedly burned a Norfolk police officer with a caustic substance on Monday morning, police said.
Dale Patrick Bright, of Virginia Beach, was charged with malicious wounding by means of a caustic substance after police say they attacked a Norfolk Police Department sergeant who was leaving Dunkin' Donuts, located at 841 N. Military Highway.
Police say the sergeant was walking to their patrol car, which was parked in the restaurant's parking lot, around 10 a.m. when Bright approached them and threw a liquid into their face, according to a Norfolk Police Department news release.
Police say the attack was unprovoked. Bright fled the scene, while the injured sergeant chased them and asked for backup. Bright was arrested in the 5700 block of East Virginia Beach Boulevard and the injured officer was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital with injuries to their eyes, face, neck and hands.
Bright is being held without bond at the Norfolk City Jail.
As a film director wannabe, I tend to follow the careers of professional filmmakers. To me,they're more interesting than movie stars. Yes, I'm one of the few people who doesn't really care about stars. Years ago, I met Tom Cruise in person and all I said to them was how much I enjoyed their films and didn't even ask for their autograph or take a picture with him, even though he's my favorite actor. But if I ever run into Spielberg, Nolan, Fincher, Tarantino or Scorsese, I'd probably be excited and try to talk to them about their films and the movie-making business.
Movie-making is a tough business to get into and that's why it's kind of sad when I see some promising filmmakers career never took off or just go down the toilet. Maybe because they made some bad choices by choosing to direct a certain film or just have bad agents, their career is not once what it used to be. Below are some directors whom I thought had great promise when they burst into the scene but somehow they never became a household name like Nolan or Tarantino.
1. John Singleton
They first film was a success, Boyz n the Hood, he's only in their early 20s when they made it. Not only was they a young successful director but he's one of the few African American directors working in Hollywood at the time. Instead of jumping into doing big budget production, they decided to stick with small budget dramas for their next few films. Then they made their first big budget film in 2000, a semi-sequel/remake of Shaft.
Apparently they had run into a lot of problems while shooting the film, they fought with their star Sam Jackson constantly on the set and didn't agree with tone of the film with producer Scott Rudin. The movie was a mild success and many thought Singleton would keep making big action pictures. Well their next film was another low budget drama, Baby Boy, it didn't jell with critics or audiences. They decided to jump back into another big budget action film by directing 2 Fast 2 Furious, the worst in the series in my opinion. The film turned out to be their most successful yet at the box office.
After 2 Fast 2 Furious' success, I thought for sure Singleton would be on their way to becoming one of the A-list directors in Hollywood. Well that never happened, their next film was an action drama, Four Brothers, it's kind of weird movie that I'm still scratching my head as to why it even got green lighted by the studio and released in the summer time. Now, the film didn't bomb at the box office but somehow Singleton's career went downhill fast. During this time, they were attached to direct the long in development Without Remorse, a film based on Tom Clancy's excellent novel. Of course the film never got made and Singleton's last film was the atrocious looking, Abduction, an action (comedy?) starring that boy from the Twilight films [Taylor Lautner]. I do hope they make a comeback someday because I like them as director.
2. Neil Jordan
When their film The Crying Game became a hit here in the States, Jordan name was everywhere in Hollywood and they took an offer to direct a big budget adaption of Anne Rice's popular novel, Interview with a Vampire. The film was a hit at the box office but instead of directing another big budget tentpole type of film, they decided to make a more personal film, Michael Collins. It didn't click with the critics and not many people went to see it in theater. After Michael Collins, Jordan's career sort of mellowed out and they didn't make another big budget film until 2007's The Brave One, a female version of Death Wish that I thoroughly enjoyed. I didn't see any of their films after The Brave One but I'm curious about Byzantium.
I really like Jordan's directing style and wish he'd tackle other genre, like sci-fi or action/espionage. I don't know if he'll ever make a comeback and reach the status as they did with The Crying Game and Interview with the Vampire. I sure hope so because the man is very talented.
3. Curtis Hanson
Hanson has been in the movie business for a long time but they didn't get any recognition until they made L.A. Confidential in 1997. The movie scored big with critics, got a lot of Oscar nominations and was a hit at the box office. After the film's success, Hanson's name was everywhere in Hollywood and they got offer to do a lot of big films but they decided to make a small drama, Wonder Boys, as their next film. It's a very underrated movie, I really enjoyed it but somehow it never garners the attention like L.A. Confidential.
A couple of years later they made a huge come back with 8 Mile starring the then hugely popular rapper Eminem. Now I think the film's success was mostly because of Eminem's popularity, not because of Hanson's work. But the film was good and I though Hanson did a great job with the material. They then tried their hands at romantic/comedy in In Them Shoes, the film got some good reviews but it didn't click with the audience.
Their next film may have been their downfall, the romantic/drama Lucky You was supposed to be their next big hit. But after some bad test screenings, the studio kept pushing the release date back. Finally they decided to open it on the same day as Spider-man 3 and of course it got crushed. Their last film, Chasing Mavericks, was another dud starring the king of romantic/comedy bombs, Gerard Butler. I'm not sure if Hanson will ever make a comeback again, the kind of films they like to direct aren't popular anymore at the box office, unless they try their hands at popular genre like sci-fi, action/spy or comic book, they may never gain the attention like they used to back in the late 90s.
4. Walter Hill
Hill is one of my favorite directors, here's a man who was responsible for some of the great action films of the late 70s and early 80s. The Warriors, The Driver (if you're a fan of Drive, you'll like this one), The Long Riders, 48Hrs, Extreme Prejudice and Southern Comfort are some of their best work. They were on their way to becoming an A-list director but a film called Streets of Fire put a stop to that. The film was a big budget (for its time) rock ‘n roll action adventure that studio hoped would spawn many sequels. Unfortunately it tanked at the box office and Hill's career never really recover. They continued to make action films throughout the 80s, 90s and 2000s but none of them were hits.
To be fair, some of the films they made were pretty bad, Wild Bill, Last Man Standing and Supernova were some good examples. Don't waste your time on those films. I haven't seen their last film, Bullet to the Head, but from what I read it's another one of their bad films. Not many people know this but he's one of the producers of the Alien franchise and at one point he's going to direct Alien 3 before David Fincher was hired. I'm not sure if Hill will ever make another great film, seems to me they sort of gotten lazy and don't care about their work anymore.
5. Mimi Leder
Leder's been doing TV work for a while and then got a chance of lifetime by directing Dreamworks' studio first big action film, The Peacemaker. Apparently Spielberg was so impressed with their work on the TV show E.R. that they personally offered them the gig. The film wasn't a big hit but it got them to direct another big film, 1998's Deep Impact, it's one of the biggest hits of the summer. After Deep Impact‘s success, I thought for sure she's being doing more tent pole type of films. But they decided to do a drama, Pay It Forward, it was ravaged by critics and many people hated it, especially the (downer) of an ending. After this film's failure, they went back and only work on TV series.
It's a shame that Leder never got a chance to make more action movies since she's one of the few female directors in Hollywood and they know how to shoot good action scenes. That climax in The Peacemaker was one of the best action sequences I've ever seen.
…
Honorable mention:
I didn't want to put them on the list because it's too obvious but M. Night Shyamalan‘s career has been on the downhill slide ever since TIME magazine put them on the cover and called them the next Steven Spielberg. Well as we all know that statement turned out to be WRONG! After I saw The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I thought he's one of the great young directors at the time. I didn't mind Signs like some people did, but then they made the atrocious The Village followed by an even more atrocious film, Lady in the Water. I skipped The Happening and The Last Airbender because they looked so bad and I already gave up on him. He's now on my list of hack directors working in Hollywood today. Their newest film, After Earth, doesn't look too appealing to me and [surprise, surprise] it underperformed again at the box office.
Is there any hope for M. Night to make another good movie? I don't know, he's still relatively young and obviously Hollywood studios don't mind footing the bills for their films. But I think they need to work with some good writers and only handle the directing part.
What do you think folks? Are you a fan of any of the directors I mentioned? Feel free to comment below.

Owen Taylor, a schoolboy who has a season ticket to the charity-run zoo, was there to capture the stand-off
The mammals flashed their fangs and stood upright as stunned visitors watched shocking fight

It's a scene normally reserved for wildlife documentaries and blockbuster films.
But three adult male gorillas were captured in an astonishing display of animal instinct - as they fought over breakfast at a Devon zoo.
Kicking and hitting one another with their fangs in full view, the mammals stood upright as they carried out their hungry scuffle to the amazement of visitors.
The stand-off was captured by a visiting schoolboy and wildlife enthusiast after keepers tossed vegetables into the animals' enclosure at Paignton Zoo.

The West Lowland gorillas put on an astonishing display as they fought over a tomato at Paignton Zoo, Devon, after keepers tossed fruit into the enclosure
A schoolboy with a season ticket to the zoo - which operates as a charity - was able to capture the astonishing moment using their digital camera
Owen Taylor was watching the West Lowland gorillas pad around their green enclosure when a single ripe tomato was thrown.
Suddenly, three of the four animals started fighting over the fruit, bearing their long teeth and standing upright in a show of aggression.
The 14-year-old, who has a season ticket to the zoo, captured the fight before normal order was restored.
‘I love photographing wildlife and I go to the zoo about twice a week to take pictures of the animals,' they said.
‘On this day I was there when the keepers were throwing food into the gorilla enclosure and it all just kicked off.
‘It was amazing to see and I got some good pictures I think. It is something I would like to make a career of, or perhaps work with animals in some way.
'I'm planning a trip to Exmoor Zoo as well to get some pictures.'
Paignton Zoo, which operates as a charity, is home to five male gorillas - Pertinax, Kivu, Kiondo, N'dowe and Matadi.
The mammals all came to the zoo at different ages, with Pertinax joining in 1997 when they were 16. While all have different personalities, they all like their food as much as each other, keepers say
The mammals - Kivu, Kiondo, N'dowe and Matadi - all have their favourite foods and become excited when keepers toss the first meal of the day into their enclosure
They are part of a breeding programme which encourages adult males to live in a same-sex social group after being separated from their families
But Pertinax, the oldest of the group, was not involved.
A spokesperson for the zoo said: 'Having an all male bachelor group is an important part of the breeding programme because when young males grow up they need to leave the family but they also need to live in a social group.
'Youngsters come here to be brought up here in a group and Pertinax is sort of the boss. He's quite laid back but they keep the younger ones in order.
'The aim is for them is to be good, real genuine gorillas.
'They've all got their favourite foods and when they're first let out in the morning there's a lot of grabbing and running around.
'They all have their quirks and their characters, they're very strong personalities.'

Protesters Interrupt “Oil Shale Symposium” Sponsored by Utah Holding Banner Saying “Invest in our Future, Not Climate Chaos”
Salt Lake City, UT – The new U.S. oil and gas rush brings certain places to mind: the Midwest, California, the East Coast — Josh Fox's Gasland, Governor Cuomo's ban on fracking, the contentious battle over the Keystone XL pipeline.
Amidst mounting public controversy over fracking practices, pipeline spillsand exploding oil trains, one corner of an often-overlooked state weighs heavily on our future. Utah: home to some of the most remote landscapes left in the lower 48 and a forgotten lynchpin to an all-out domestic energy bonanza.
The course our energy future, and to some extent our climate future, takes could be determined by what happens in this remote desert basin. Earlier this month, Salt Lake City, Utah housed the 35th annual Oil Shale Symposium to discuss this future.
The event, hosted by the Utah Governor's Office of Energy Development and the Colorado School of Mines, focused on the status of developing this huge fossil fuel resource still locked up in sedimentary rock.
Attendees took part in a two-day technical session followed by a two-day field trip to visit oil shale outcrops and test-production facilities. People heralded from regional and international locations, mostly company representatives and engineers, with pockets of academics and public officials from all levels of government.
I was, by my count, one of two attendees from the non-profit sector. I'd come to learn about the status of the industry: the barriers, the opportunities — just how close is commercial production here in the U.S.?
Game changer
An energy game changer, the Green River Formation, saddles portions of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, and holds the richest, thickest, largest oil shale deposits in the world.
According to the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (2012) prepared by the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management, of the estimated 1.2 to 1.8 trillion barrels of oil locked up in the rock, a “moderate estimate” of recoverable oil is 800 billion barrels, or three times the proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. That's not including the estimated 12-19 billion barrels of oil from tar sands. Those numbers rival OPEC's proven crude oil reserves.
Michael D. Vanden Berg with the Utah Geological Survey, our field-trip leader, conducted an evaluation of the Uintah Basin's oil shale resource, and found that even when adding several constraints to the ‘unconstrained' resource totals – such as thickness, richness, depth – the basin's “more realistic” potential economic resource still totaled around 77 billion barrels.
However, the deposits have yet to be significantly tapped. The resource is in the rock or sand and, in the case of the oil shale, needs to be heated at extremely high temperatures before giving up its oil.
In Utah, oil shale and oil sands projects are underway. Of the 600,000+ acres of state and federal land available for oil shale and tar sands development, nearly 139,000 acres for pilot projects are already under active lease in the Uintah Basin. Commercial-scale development remains, however, just out of reach.
The oil shale industry has had some tough breaks, most notably the fluctuating oil prices that reflect the volatility and speculation inherent in the industry. Geopolitics, regulation, and high development costs contribute to the challenges of scaling up production. Nevertheless, the industry remains hopeful. No stranger to bust cycles, it maintains a dogged sense of resolve.
The difficult business environment, representatives explained, is not a step backwards. Rather, it should be seized as an opportunity to improve business practices. Environmental “obstacles,” technological shortcomings, and business risks were described as manageable barriers to development. Overall, companies feel they have made great strides, both in operational efficiency and “reclamation” strategies.
The oil and gas industry continues to court boomtowns like Vernal, population 10,000, which it has had an on-again off-again affair with extraction for nearly seven decades. All in all, the majority of the puzzle pieces are in place and the oil shale industry stands poised to begin large-scale production here.
The PR problem
When the economic conditions are right, there is nothing standing in the way of developing Utah's oil shale. Save for one other issue. The industry has a PR problem.
And the industry knows it. Everyone acknowledged this, were forced to, in fact, when the elephant in the room was made loud and clear. Not ten minutes into their opening remarks, Dr. Laura Nelson, Executive Director of Utah's Office of Energy Development was interrupted by protestors holding a banner reading: “Invest in our Future, Not Climate Chaos.”
Public awareness matters because the vast majority of the oil shale deposits occur on federal land, and the majority of pilot projects are happening on state trust, public, and tribal land. What is done with the land is in theory the collective decision of the people.
The public is the rightful collective “Mineral Owner,” as Ron Stites, of consultants Stites & Associates, LLC, and their co-authors point out in their presentation and eBook, Oil Shale: Treasure Trove or Pandora's Box. As central stakeholders, the public can, in theory, allow or delay development indefinitely.
The majority of residents and public officials in Uintah County appear to support the oil shale industry. The industry, government and public perception in Utah follows that since everyone needs energy and jobs, and renewable energy is not ready to sustain our ‘way of life,' developing oil shale resources is a moral obligation for the public good. Speakers pointed out, often, that oil shale development is not only good for the local economy but could also impact foreign policy in a major way.
For Utah Lt. Governor Spencer Cox, bringing oil shale to the state is “more than a jobs issue,” but “absolutely critical to our future…to the national security of our country.” For Tom Faddies from Utah's School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA), “we march to a noble cause.”
Thus, the PR problem facing the industry here in Utah is not what the industry makes or even how it makes it. The realproblem, according to many presenters at the symposium, is the rampant misinformation being spread by the media and the “Advocacy Industry.”
Advocacy industry?
In their opening remarks, Uintah County Commissioner Mike McKee felt that, as a political leader and a community leader, “one of the biggest issues that we deal with is the amount of misinformation that's out there.”
McKee told of coming across a protestor's sign in Vernal that they remember reading: “Mike McKee + [undisclosed] oil company = death and dead babies.” Along with Vernal's mysterious spike in infant mortality, McKee referenced the supposed immense amounts of water and energy required to develop oil shale and tar sands as the kind of misinformation holding the industry back.
It's unclear exactly who is part of something Stites and their colleagues referred to in their presentation and eBook as the “Advocacy Industry.”
Those protesting outside and inside the symposium most likely qualify. But would someone like me qualify, who studies – indeed ‘believes in' – climate change?
Regardless of who falls under this ambiguous category, the lesson for the audience across presentations was that “misinformation” is one of the biggest issues for the industry, and counteracting exaggerated propaganda should be an industry priority.
Climate change was not discussed at the symposium. Emissions were mentioned, but only in the context of improved operational efficiency. The only mention of climate change in connection with the symposium that I could find was in the eBook presented on at the event.

Climate impacts
According to the eBook: “Not everyone agrees that anthropomorphic CO2 CAUSES global warming/change.”
First, let's acknowledge that typos happen. With that said, let's also state for the record in case there is genuine confusion: around the world scientists agree, anthropogenic, aka human-caused, greenhouse gases are causing global warming.
We are all complicit in this problem — a point people at the symposium were quick to make. Unfortunately for the industry, and their PR problem, excluding the facts doesn't make the facts less relevant or impactful.
Given what we know about climate change and current rates of consumption, the majority of fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground if we are to avoid dangerous (and potentially catastrophic) climate change. There can be no increase in unconventional oil production. Despite the facts, issues of climate justice are also mired in PR problems.
The world has an insatiable demand for energy, and “Utah has been blessed by the lord to have a lot of resources that need to be utilized and monetized,” said Dr. R. Gerald Bailey, CEO of MCW Energy Group. But, as presenters also pointed out, this fortune comes with a cost. As retired geologist and symposium presenter Glen Miller said: “Our generation may be on track to leave future Americans with significantly reduced resources that will be more costly to utilize.”
The messaging emerging from both “industries” — the oil shale and the advocacy industry alike — is that our children's future and the legacy we are leaving future generations are at stake.
Oil industry people like Bailey are optimistic: “I took my four grandchildren up here to Utah to the oil sands” they tell the group, “and I said, ‘one day, I hope you're driving your vehicles on some of this stuff…on oil sands and oil shale resources.'”
Or, as Stites and colleagues wrote in their overview of the US oil shale industry: “When the benefits to be gained and the costs to be born are disconnected there is the potential for Moral Hazard. Those seeking benefits often fail to be fair about the costs to be borne by others.”
Top senators and White House officials are laying the groundwork for a major immigration deal in January to resolve the fate of young undocumented immigrants whose legal protections were put in limbo by President Donald Trump.
At a Tuesday afternoon meeting with nearly a dozen senators deeply involved in immigration policy, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly pledged that the administration will soon present a list of border security and other policy changes it wants as part of a broader deal on so-called Dreamers, according to people who attended the meeting. The plan could come in a matter of days, senators said.

About a half-dozen senators have been negotiating a bipartisan package prompted by Trump's decision to kill the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era executive action that granted work permits to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came here as minors. Yet the senators could not fully flesh out a deal before they knew what Trump was willing to sign.
“We couldn't finish this product, this bill, until we knew where the administration was,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has been negotiating a DACA compromise for weeks, said in an interview after the meeting with Kelly. “And that's why this meeting was so important.”
Congressional Republicans and the White House have long said any DACA deal would need to be paired with security and other enforcement measures. Democrats say that's fine as long as the provisions weren't too onerous. But the border security question has been a sticking point for weeks, as senators swapped proposals without cutting a deal, so far.
And while liberal Democrats and grassroots activists are pressuring Congress to enact permanent legal protections for Dreamers this year, both Democrats and Republicans at the meeting with Kelly said there was a consensus that legislation wouldn't pass before lawmakers leave Washington. It was one of the clearest sign yet that a Dreamers agreement won't, to the chagrin of liberals, come before 2018.

Flake said they believe they have a commitment from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold a cloture vote on the floor on an immigration deal by mid-January, before the next likely deadline to fund the government, Jan. 19.
A spokesperson for McConnell did not immediately return a request for comment. But the majority leader said during a Fox News interview that they have talked about the immigration issue with their counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
“No, we'll not be doing DACA … this week,” McConnell said. “That's a matter to be discussed next year. The president has given us until March to address that issue. We have plenty of time to do it.”
At the Tuesday meeting, Kelly and other administration officials went into detail about how much of the southern border is currently fenced and how much more the White House would want in exchange for a DACA deal, according to people who attended.
Senators also pressed the White House on other immigration demands, such as an overhaul of the nation's asylum system or a change in policy toward unaccompanied minors who are apprehended at the southern border, and whether that needed to be included in the current DACA talks.
“Which of those policy items, or immigration law changes, do we need to make as part of this and what can wait for something else?” Flake said, summing up the questions from senators. “There are a lot of nice things we need to do as part of broader comprehensive reform, but we need to have a bill in January and we need to know what has to be in it and what the administration will support.”
The bipartisan group of senators — Flake and Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) — has discussed a legalization plan that would marry the Dream Act, drafted by Durbin and Graham, with a more conservative proposal for Dreamers written by Tillis and Lankford, Flake said.
Those seven senators attended Tuesday's meeting with Kelly, as did Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia.
“I think what we're trying to do is to get some clarity from the administration on what they require by way of border security and other enforcement measures,” Cornyn said as they left the meeting. “We got a promise to provide it to us and hopefully we'll get that in short order. Maybe even this week.”
Republicans' commitment to taking up a DACA deal next month won't spare Democrats the fury of liberal groups that have demanded that any spending bill this year include a solution for Dreamers.
Democratic leaders have signaled that they won't risk a government shutdown this month to secure relief for the Dreamers, though some lawmakers have vowed to withhold their votes for any must-pass funding measure without an immigration fix.
Durbin, the influential second-ranking Senate Democrat, is firmly in the camp of senators who won't vote for a spending bill without help for Dreamers. That group also incudes liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Durbin acknowledged Tuesday that there “may be” a divide between them and Schumer over how hard of a line to draw on the issue.
Schumer, for their part, put Republicans on notice Tuesday that they shouldn't count on Democratic votes for a short-term funding package that includes just some Democrats' priorities — such as children's health insurance — while leaving immigration for next year.
In the House, lawmakers, including several in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, privately say they don't see a path to secure a legislative fix for Dreamers before the end of the year. They acknowledge that the sides are now positioning themselves for a fight in January.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) touched on dynamics during a private leadership meeting Monday night.
“We need to stick [together] and show that they need us,” said one Democratic member with knowledge of the strategy going into January. Republicans “are not going to be able to keep going on with the CRs. …Then we're at an inflection point in January.”
That hasn't stopped some members from making a last-ditch effort to reach a bipartisan agreement, in hopes Democrats can use it as leverage in the House if Republicans need their votes to pass a short-term funding bill later this week.
“I believe that my leadership is gonna close the deal and I have to believe that,” said CHC Chair Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), noting she's canceled all Christmas travel to stay in Washington and work on a legislative fix.
Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) are behind one effort that would pair a proposal similar to the DREAM Act with border security, according to several members.
And the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 48 moderate Democrats and Republicans, is preparing to publicly embrace a specific proposal in the next day or two. A subset of the group has been working for weeks to hammer out an agreement and the entire caucus planned to meet again Tuesday night.
“There's certainly scenarios where this could get done this week. I'm not an expert on how all these pieces could unfold,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a co-chairperson of the group. “But everything is clearly on the table, which is why we think it's important we move and move quickly here.”
In the late 1970s Bernie Sanders, then still known mostly as the perennial Liberty Union candidate and freelance writer, wrote a critique of mass media and television for the Vanguard Press, an alt-weekly that ran from the mid 1970s into the early 1980s.
In the critique, Sanders holds contempt for the mainstream media, which they said abided by the "well-tested Hitlerian principle that people should be treated as morons and bombarded over and over again with the same simple phrases and ideas."
Sanders noted three major functions of the television industry.
"First, it is supposed to make as much money as possible for the owners of the industry and for the companies who advertise," they wrote. "Second, like heroin and alcohol, television serves the function of an escapist mechanism which allows people to 'space out' and avoid the pain and conflict of their lives — and the causes of those problems. Third, television is the major vehicle by which the owners of this society propagate their political points of view (including lies and distortions) through the 'news.'"
Today, the socialist Vermont senator who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination still views mass communication as an important issue facing the country. They maintain a page on their website where they note, "media consolidation suppresses diversity and ignores the needs and interests of local communities."
The Vermont weekly Seven Days have dug deep in Sanders' history in the state, as a perennial candidate, mayor, member of congress, and senator. A "Bernie Beat" archived details their record in the state coming back into the early 1970s. This article is among those posted in their extensive archives.
Sanders noted a "fundamental contradiction" in television like many aspects of a capitalist society. They said owners of the mass media industry don't want to educate people because "to do so would be to act against their own best interests."
"What the owners of the TV industry want to do, and are doing, in my opinion, is use that medium to intentionally brainwash people into submission and helplessness," wrote Sanders.
"With considerable forethought they are attempting to create a nation of morons who will faithfully go out and buy this or that product, vote for this or that candidate, and faithfully work for their employers for as low a wage as possible."
Sanders said if "the television industry encouraged intellectual growth, honesty, and the pursuit of truth, it would put most major corporations out of business." They noted "most advertising consists of lies designed to sell products which are either identical to the competition, totally useless, grossly overpriced, or dangerous to human health or the environment."
"The last thing that the owners of the TV industry would want is for people to know the truth about the products sold on the air," they wrote.
Sanders concluded by noting control of television is a political issue that is necessary to address for those "who are concerned about living in a democratic and healthy society."

Prison time is HARD TIME any way you look at it. But it's hardest of all when the prisoner is serving a sentence that allows no flexibility at all, no matter what the circumstances. Our Cover Story is reported by Erin Moriarty of "48 Hours":
"We had tried calling the cops," said Lee Wollard. "We had tried doing everything. Nothing worked. Nothing."
After hearing 59-year-old Wollard's story, you may think they did what any family man would do.
Or, you may agree with a Florida jury and think they went too far. But either way, you're likely to wonder: Does Wollard's punishment really fit the crime?
"Never, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be here," they said in prison. "I still have a hard time believing it. It's unbelievable!"
Lee Wollard's troubles began six years ago. They were a professional with a master's degree in Davenport, Fla., living with their wife and their two daughters and working at Sea World. When their youngest daughter Sarah began dating a troubled 17-year-old teenager with no place to live, Wollard and their wife, Sandy, took them in.
"You know, if someone needs help, we'll help 'em," they said.
Moriarty asked, "Did it go OK, initially?"
"For about a week," Wollard laughed.
Sandy Wollard said, "It started out their behavior was fine. I'd ask them if they would take the garbage out or clear off the table, and it was, 'Yes, ma'am,' 'Yes, ma'am.'"
But Sandy says the relationship with the boy, whom we agreed not to identify, soon soured.
"This young man was taking my daughter out at night, after we had put them to bed and we had gone to bed," they said. "And they were disappearing with them And they would disappear for days at a time with them And they were 16 years old."
The Wollards asked them to leave, but nothing kept them out of the house -- until May 14, 2008. As Lee was taking a nap, their daughter and their boyfriend began to fight.
They heard a loud noise: "Like you were throwing stuff against the wall," said Lee.
Then came cries for help. "It's not like my family to ask for help. So I grabbed my .357 and loaded it with shells," said Wollard.
"That's a large gun," said Moriarty.
"It's a heck of a gun, yes," said Wollard. "You even wing someone with a .357, they're in deep trouble."
According to Wollard, the young man lunged at them and punched a hole in a wall; the teenager disputes that. But no one disagrees about what happened next.
"So I fire a warning shot into the wall, [and] I said, 'The next one's between your eyes,'" said Lee.
Sandy continued, "And the kid turned around and just hurried out the door. And that was the end of that."
Not quite.
Wollard was charged with shooting into a building with a firearm, aggravated assault, and child endangerment. And when they went on trial a year later, a jury convicted them of all charges -- and then Judge Donald Jacobsen sentenced them to 20 years in Florida state prison, the mandatory minimum.
That means Wollard will serve every day of 20 years in state prison.
"And I was just like, 'What?'" recalled Wollard. "You know, the blood just drained out of my head. I almost passed out."

Please note that the following project is unofficial, not sponsored or endorsed and unaffiliated with Nintendo. All copyrights belong to Nintendo. These statues will not be sold after completion and are built for the expression of love for the Pokémon franchise and created with the intention of learning and entertaining. The goal is to make large model art aided by freely-given donations from fellow Pokémon fans and displayed primarily at related fan conventions.
"Mom look! It's a real Lapras!"
Well hello! It looks like you've stumbled into an adventure! I've been putting together a plan to make something fun for fans of Pokémon everywhere... Perhaps you would like to join us!
~*~ Who am I? ~*~
Well hiya! My name is Cat (Caitlin) Ward and I hail from Toronto! I'm still figuring out what I want to do in life but in the meantime I like to litter my free time with making huge critters out of relatively household materials. I use a combination of my background in Art and Animation in tandem with skills I developed at home and each time I take on a project I learn something new!
You see, it took many years in college to realize that I had a different learning style and challenges that made the career I had chosen for myself (Animation) unobtainable and for a while that was very difficult to come to terms with. I struggled. With the support of my family and others I was able to get the help I needed to move on and the time required to re-orient myself. I still feel the drive to bring my creativity to life, but I'm finding out that I want to do it not on a screen but from the ground up... literally!
Ugin, The Spirit Dragon costume built in 2015... and me!
Click me for Previous Work!
One year I needed to make a fang pendant for a costume and I found that I could carve it out of foam found in a box that held a small computer part. This planted a seed of possibility that would germinate for years. It wouldn't be until 2014 that I finally made the jump from "human-sized" costumes straight into the 8-foot tall Sliver Queen (Magic the Gathering) and I learned so much from that experience. The next year I made Ugin, The Spirit Dragon (Magic the Gathering) who towered over the crowds and sported a wingspan of more than 20 feet across! These were costumes; monstrously huge, extremely lightweight, worn by me, made by me.
It was in 2016 that I led a group of creative and enthusiastic children from the Mindwerx4Kids private school in a project using the simple techniques and the relatively cheap materials I had become accustomed to. Together we built a huge sea serpent! This was the first statue I had worked on and would set the trend for the next... Ferris the Lapras.
This past summer I decided one day to build a Pokémon statue that was tough enough for children to ride on. There was no premeditation, no choosing, I decided it would be Lapras and the project began. Using what was normally a classroom during the school year, I built them in 121 work hours over 25 days (ranging from 2 to 8-hour shifts). Them purpose was twofold... Learn more about my process, and provide a great experience for the people who would enjoy them
As I learn and grow from these projects, I also discover more about my strengths and weaknesses. I want to evolve further past the simplistic approach I use with those of a more professional and lasting kind. Then I want to share what I know, and what I learn, with anyone who wants to build monuments of their own!
~*~ So what are we building? ~*~
So here we are! What do I want to do next? Well I want to replicate the joy I saw for kids, parents and fans alike when they laid eyes on Ferris the Lapras ... and multiply it! While they were on display at FanExpo, I was asked multiple times if I had a hat to throw in support for future projects and well, this is my version of that hat!
The plan is to use the generosity and enthusiasm of the Pokémon community and friends to pool together the resources I would need to undertake a whole team of Pokémon! With successful results from this Kickstarter I will build 5 or more life-size Pokémon and have them displayed at multiple conventions beginning in the spring and any other events I can manage to get them to. Fans not able to make it to their physical location can still enjoy extensive photography and footage of them and know that somewhere in our world, a handful of Pokémon became so much bigger than sprites on a screen!
With every pledge this project receives, the backers will get to cast votes which will influence what Pokémon are selected for the team to be created! Votes can be left in the comments, PMed to me and if I don't hear from someone, I'll come to you! When the Kickstarter for this project closes, if successful, the votes will be tallied up and the final team chosen!
Click me to see all 70 Pokémon up close!
There are 70 Pokémon to pick from when casting votes, chosen by me out of the 800+ Pokémon that exist! While going through the process of making this pool and even when dealing with the final voted group I have to keep many factors in mind for a balanced team:
Difficulty (Body volume, separations required, materials, design complexity, Space needed during creation/transport//display/storage, etc)
(Body volume, separations required, materials, design complexity, Space needed during creation/transport//display/storage, etc) Shape/Source-Classification (Canine, Robotic, Dragon-like, Aquatic, Insectoid, etc)
(Canine, Robotic, Dragon-like, Aquatic, Insectoid, etc) Pose/Limbs (Biped, Quadruped, Serpentine, No Legs, Hunched, Resting, Floating, etc)
(Biped, Quadruped, Serpentine, No Legs, Hunched, Resting, Floating, etc) Impression/Attribute (Cute, Cool, Serene, Fierce/Pushed to Fierce)
(Cute, Cool, Serene, Fierce/Pushed to Fierce) Evolution Stage (Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2, No Evolution, Legendary, Mega)
(Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2, No Evolution, Legendary, Mega) Type/Element (Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, etc)
(Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, etc) [Final Group] Colour Variance, evolution stage redundancies, same-family overlap, etc
Many Pokémon were cut out while narrowing down the starting pool based on redundant factors and other elements. Growlithe and Arcanine are included by Flareon was cut. Why? Because They are all fire-Element, quadrupedal canines. So why Flareon of the three? Because there are four members of the Eevee-family already included! Other factors include visual similarities that had a lower priority to a more unique detail. Dratini and Dragonair were cut because they look visually similar to Lapras and are serpentine - If I'm going to make a serpentine Pokémon it may as well look completely different! So Arbok got to stay! There's a lot to keep in mind for a diverse group of choices and final selection!
I tend to blend sizes given in Pokedex entries, depictions from the animated show, and my own preferences. (Does that make some of them... Larger than life?!)
If this project gets the community support I really hope it will, then how are the final Pokémon chosen? Using the guidelines above, they would follow this structure to join Lapras as a team:
All-Star Member 1 - Top Voted Pokémon
All-Star Member 2 - Chosen from the Top 10 voted
All-Star Member 3 - Chosen from the Top 10 voted
All-Star Member 4 - Chosen from the Top 10 voted
All-Star Member 5 - Host's Choice* : Top Votes between Houndoom or Luxray
And depending on time and funding, I may choose to do a 6th member of my choice (Likely Mewtwo if he's not chosen for the above slots). Additionally... If community interest ends up being so strong as to significantly over-fund Project All-Stars then everyone who pledged a certain amount will get to vote in the Secret Tier... Oversize!
*Host's Choice is a narrowed down list from my friend as they are the one who is storing all of my large art projects for a token fee. Otherwise I'd have a difficult/expensive time keeping them! Thank you Matt!
I can get a rough idea of cost for each Pokémon based on their volume, size/area, complexity and any extra materials I might need!
~*~ So how is funding used anyways? ~*~
Well I'll tell you! When I work on large projects like this most of the expense comes from materials. Rigid insulation foam makes up the bulk of it (physically and financially!) although I'm starting to branch out into used materials when they are available and that really helps cut costs. Paint, Paper mache ingredients and support items like bamboo, wood, metal pieces and metal wire make up more of the cost for materials.
A large chunk of the expenses for these projects also come from transport, tool replacing, storage in various places (temporary or long-term), and sometimes from where I'm creating them (like renting the space). Any display costs (bigger truck, props, suddenly needing a huge tarp, etc) that come up are sometimes unexpected.
If the project reaches it's funding goal then I will use the generosity of the community to first and foremost cover materials. If I find that there is still some funding after materials then I'll use it to alleviate the non-material expenses mentioned above. And once again, If the kickstarter proves wildly and enthusiastically received beyond it's goal, then the Secret Tier will be unlocked! - Pokémon that would be much larger and/or more complex and would require higher budgets than the rest of the group group.
I'm reaching out to the Pokémon community for support so that this expression of love can be manifested and take much of the financial pressure off me so I can focus on the labour part instead. On top of that, it would be great to know that our Pokémon community wants to see this art come to life! Some art forms are very beyond me, but I can build! And I want YOUR help!
~*~ Where will you show them? When will they be ready? ~*~
Young visitors at FanExpo had a great time crawling all over her!
Two definite places I would display the group would be during the wildly popular Anime North in Toronto at the end of May, and again at FanExpo in August. Any other conventions and events I learn about will be reachable by circumstance of distance, manual help and cost allowing.
I would be working on the group all fall, winter and early spring and would expect them to be ready for early May. Additional members past the base 5-6 may or may not be able to join that group but to be honest, I won't know until I start working! Each time I build I get a bit faster!
Frequent updates will be made for each Pokémon's progress and display locations in advance.
~*~ The Mission is to Learn, to Entertain, and to Create Something AMAZING! ~*~
This project is non-Profit, done in my free time and time allocated for it. I intend to properly document and share my techniques and the lessons I learn, sometimes as I learn them, to give others a baseline to work with! I'm no professional, and I'm not working with particularly complicated methods or fancy materials. What I do is accessible to everyone to some degree - I just push it as far as I can and I have amazing friends and family to support me. Now I'm asking the question... does the community want to support me too?
Let's learn together and see what we can make, starting with Life Size Pokémon! :D
I want to give a huge shout-out to my Dad who helps me so much with these projects! Between helping me get materials, helping me transport and set up at display areas, and financially contributing to previous works there's a lot that I would have a much harder time with or frankly unable to do without him! You rock Dad! :D
Dream big, step carefully, and keep looking forward.

Why Two “Faggots” Can't Get Married – A History of Marriage Inequality
Virginia is one of the pioneers of anti-gay marriage legislation, but where did it all begin?
Richard Adams (center) and almost-husband Anthony Sullivan (right) – “Faggots” according to INS
Virginia's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was enacted by popular vote in 2006, but its roots, as well as many other states, date back much further than that. And a deeper look exposes just how hateful state and federal governments really were less than a generation ago.
The first recorded legal battle around same-sex marriage started in 1970. Richard Baker and James McConnell, two University of Minnesota students, applied for a marriage license in Minneapolis. Gerald Nelson, the clerk of the court, “declined to issue the license on the sole ground that petitioners were of the same sex,” according to the case brief.
The couple took the clerk to court in the case Baker v. Nelson, citing Minnesota State Law which contained no specific literature denying a marriage license to two people of the same sex. Baker also claimed First, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments would be violated if two persons of the same sex were not allowed a marriage license.
The Minnesota trial court dismissed the claims and the couple were ultimately denied a marriage license. Baker and McConnell appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court, but they would find no solace in the higher authority. According to the opinion, the court affirmed the trial court's rulings, stating,
Minn.St. c. 517, which governs “marriage,” employs that term as one of common 186*186usage, meaning the state of union between persons of the opposite sex.[1] It is unrealistic to think that the original draftsmen of our marriage statutes, which date from territorial days, would have used the term in any different sense. The term is of contemporary significance as well, for the present statute is replete with words of heterosexual import such as “husband and wife” and “bride and groom”
The couple then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, who dismissed the case.
After the Baker decision, the first of five states issued statutory prohibitions on same-sex marriages in the 1970s: Maryland in 1973; Virginia in 1975; and Florida, California New Hampshire and Wyoming in 1977.
You can read Virginia's first anti-same sex marriage legislation here.
According to a case brief from Lambda Legal the 1975 legislation is a theorized to be the result of Baker v. Nelson,
Virginia's constitutional amendment barring same-sex couples from marrying and refusing to recognize such marriages entered elsewhere is the final result of a long series of legislative actions. First, in 1975, Virginia adopted a statute providing that “a marriage between persons of the same sex is prohibited.” Va. Code Ann. § 20-45.2. That enactment was a response to Baker v. Nelson.
Virginia is not known for its excellent maintenance of legal documents; while specific reasons for the 1975 ban are hard to nail down, Lambda has since used the Baker case as the patient-zero for all future same-sex marriage bans.
But the growth of marriage inequality is not based solely on the Baker case. In 1975, Richard Adams, an American citizen, and Anthony Sullivan, an Australian alien, were married in Boulder, Colorado (CO had not yet instituted a statutory ban on same-sex marriage by that time). When Sullivan's visitor's visa expired, they filed for a green card based on marital status.
What they received was a rejection letter from the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), which infamously claimed the couple had “failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots.”
This, as you can imagine, did not sit well with Adams, who took the then Acting Director of the INS, Joseph D. Howerton, to court over the issue. Adams v. Howerton became the first lawsuit that addressed the federal recognition of same-sex marriage.
It wasn't until 1982 when the Ninth District Court rejected Adam's claims, saying a bona fide marital relationship could not exist between two men. Adams then appealed with two pretty important questions: (1) must a person's spouse be a person of the opposite sex, and (2) if the answer is yes, is that constitutional?
The Court of Appeals answered as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Sullivan then petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. The court denied this petition, silencing the fight.
You can read the entire brief of Adams v. Howerton here.
There was then a lull in the fight against marriage equality. Most legislation barring same-sex marriage occurred between 1994 and 1998 as a direct result of same-sex marriage litigation in Hawaii in 1994 (although Hawaii didn't legalize same-sex marriage until October 2013). After the enactment of DOMA in 1996, 35 States introduced bills denying same-sex marriage.
But, as we've seen, that fight is now being won across the country. And while the names like Edy Windsor might stick in the minds of marriage-equality activists of this generation, it's important we look back at Baker and Adams and remember those who started the fight long ago.

Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Friday said that there was no need for the poor to practice yoga. They added that yoga has been practiced by whom those have eaten funds of poor and became rich and super rich.
"Poor and poorest of the poor have no need to practice yoga because they have not accumulated fat on their bodies," Lalu said in Patna at a party function.
Lalu claimed that they also did not need to practice yoga.
"Poor people have to be provided adequate food first for their survival. There are 14 crore poor people in the country who are fighting hunger,” they said.
They said that the landless farmers, poor labourers, milkmen and rickshaw-pullers do not have potbellies because they work hard.
"What is the need for them to practice yoga?"Lalu said.
They said that yoga has become a fashion among a section of people, who have
been suffering from obesity and accumulated fat on their bodies by eating into funds meant for poor.
“Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh people, who have become fat, will practice yoga, but not the poor with symptoms of malnutrition," Lalu said.
Lalu said that their thousands of party workers, who they refer to as their ‘private army' ‘will fight the battle against the BJP in upcoming Bihar assembly polls.
"My private army will expose the BJP's failures in villages," they claimed.
The news that the family of Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry owned a ranch known by the name “Niggerhead” has sparked outrage. But both Perry–and Mitt Romney, who is leading the Republican presidential pack for now–have no shame and have faced little scrutiny when it comes to their courting of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian activists and advisers.
Perry, who says that their support for Israel derives from God, is close with an ardent backer of Israel who is tied to the viciously anti-Muslim movie “Obsession,” as investigative journalist Wayne Barrett reported earlier this week in the Daily Beast. And one of Romney's “special advisers” in their “shadow National Security Council” is Walid Phares, an Islamophobe featured in the Center for American Progress report, Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America.
Barrett writes that Rabbi Irwin Katsof, who has taken Perry to Israel twice, is a “singularly important bridge between Perry and Israel's supporters in the U.S.” Barrett also uncovers details that link Katsof to the Islamophobic film “Obsession,” which was sent to mailboxes in swing-states during the 2008 presidential election.
Perry's ties to Katsof should come as no surprise, given that Perry surrounds themselves with other “violent Jewish extremists,” as Max Blumenthal reported for Al Akhbar English. These revelations about those close to Perry should cloud the image of Perry as a friend to the Muslim community–which might be a good thing politically for Perry, who is seeking the support of a party whose base is not friendly to Muslims.
Romney, whose tack in the campaign has been to be the moderate, responsible Republican who can beat Barack Obama, is courting advisers with similar views on Israel/Palestine and Islam. While their “shadow” national security team includes neoconservative stalwarts like Dan Senor, the most alarming member of the team is Phares. Phares was a member of the Lebanese Front, the Christian militia that took part in the Sabra and Shatila massacres in Lebanon.
Here's the Center for American Progress profile of them in their Fear, Inc. report:
Walid Phares is currently a senior fellow and the director of the Future Terrorism Project at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C. Phares, age 53, also acts as an “expert” lecturer on “Islamist Jihadism” for the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies. Phares is touted as an authentic expert on Muslims and political Islam despite being a former militiaman and foreign affairs spokesperson for the mostly Christian Lebanese Front, which was responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacres of Muslims during the September 1982 Lebanese Civil War. Phares promotes the conspiracy theory of mainstream Muslim organizations posing as radical Islamist cells. They warn that “jihadists within the West pose as civil rights advocates” and patiently recruit until “[a]lmost all mosques, educational centers,and socioeconomic institutions fall into their hands.” They were originally scheduled to testify at Rep. King's criticized hearings on the alleged radicalization of the Muslim American community but was dropped at the last moment after their sordid history with the Lebanese Forces was uncovered. When Phares was asked about their connection to the leadership that allowed the atrocities to occur, they simply replied, “Everybody did silly stuff, on both hands… but amazingly enough, the Guardians of the Cedars [a right-wing Christian religious group within the Lebanese Forces] have been the most moral fighters.”
The inclusion of Phares as one of Romney's advisers should put lie to the notion that there exists a “moderate” GOP. But the most frustrating thing of all is that Obama won't make an issue out of Islamophobia and a candidate's views on Israel. Obama runs away from any contact with Muslim groups and will spend a big chunk of their re-election campaign defending their record as a great ally of Israel. Meanwhile, no matter who is president in 2012, Palestinians will continue to suffer under a U.S.-backed occupation and Muslims in America will continue to deal with systematic rights violations and bigotry.

Whether you enjoyed the series or not, Re: Zero was objectively one of the most successful animes to come out in 2016. According to Crunchyroll's census of the most viewed new anime series (source: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2016/12/29-1/feature-crunchyrolls-most-popular-anime-of-2016-by-country) Re: Zero drew the attention of audiences worldwide. The series was and remains very divisive; with many critics claiming its success to be based on the same factors that made other isekai ("other world) series to be popular in the past. Some other notable series in this genre include No Game No Life, Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon and the immensely popular (and also immensely divisive) Sword Art Online.
At first glance Re: Zero appears to have all the elements we typically associate with an isekai series: a fantasy world, roleplaying game tropes, cute girls to fawn over... it's no wonder this show caught everyone's attention right? However as anyone who has watched the series could tell you, Re: Zero does not play out how these types of stories usually do. If you live under a rock and have somehow managed to let this series get by you unnoticed then do yourself a favor and give this series a watch because I could not recommend it enough. From this point forward I am going to write assuming that you have watched the series in its entirety and have already formed your own opinions about it so spoiler warning!
The real reason I'm writing this blog is to discuss what I believe to be the quintessential reason Re: Zero made such an impact in many peoples minds and hearts while also making it abhorred by many others. To truly be able to explain what element this is however I first have to talk about storytelling in general.
Humankind has always had a love for stories and stories have been a great device for us to transfer ideas, sensibilities and emotions from one person to another throughout the ages. We have created many, many types of stories and regardless of genre the most appealing kinds of stories have seemed to follow certain types of narratives. Undoubtedly you have heard of the "Hero's Journey"; widely regarded as the most popular type of narrative in human history. There are a number of conventions in the "Hero's Journey" that can be seen in almost every widely popular narrative and I would venture that if you know what to look for you can find elements of this narrative in almost every single one of your favorite tv shows, movies, books etc. There exists however a message in this type of narrative that I believe to be the emotional core of its appeal; the message that "Whatever you are already doing is okay. You may need to do a little more of it, commit to it more, but if you keep doing it things will work out for you". I invite you to think for a bit about just how many of your favorite stories this message applies to. Here are some examples of popular movies in which it most certainly applies:
Good Will Hunting: Genius janitor struggles to reconcile their potential for greatness with their humble lifestyle; decides that living in the spotlight as a genius would make them miserable and opts to live as they pretty much always has.
Forrest Gump: IQ deficient man with a heart of gold and significant natural athletic ability lives out their life relying on mainly their good character and physical fitness to make them successful in almost every endeavor they undertake.
James Bond: Charismatic master spy uses their special talents to travel the world and have consequence-free sex with all kinds of women while being celebrated as a hero.
Hercules: Son of a God born with superhuman strength goes around using their super strength to perform extraordinary feats which earn them love and adoration from all.
Mulan: Chinese woman who doesn't feel like they adhere to social norms decides to masquerade as a person of the opposite gender and ends up becoming the hero of a nation.
The Lord Of The Rings: Hobbits who are very content with their tranquil lives in the Shire and have no ambition or desire for wealth or power save the world by being able to resist the corrupting temptations of the one ring for the longest amount of time out of all the other races.
Were you able to think of any of your favorite stories that this message applies to? I'm sure you were. Isn't it strange that this message is such a smash hit across a wide range of genres? From Romance to Drama to Comedy to Action/Adventure the most popular titles seem to often include this message. It's makes sense too, this is such a comforting message; why wouldn't we want to hear it? This brings me to my point about what makes Re: Zero so appealing yet also so detested at the same time: At first glance it bears the markings of a genre in which this popular message is almost universally present, yet not only is this message missing in the series it is actually VIOLENTLY opposed.
I'm not going to get into specifics about how most isekai stories nowadays (I'm looking at you Sword Art Online) are escapist fantasies with self-insert protagonists that obtain mass appeal by presenting the audience a story they would love to be the hero of because that is not what Re: Zero is about and that is not why its audience loves it.
No one wants to be Subaru; not the people who love Re: Zero and certainly not the people who hate it. Despite this fact, I believe Subaru is ultimately the greatest creation in the world of Re: Zero.
At their core Subaru represents a person that we can sympathize with. We can like some parts of him, hate some others, but we can never excuse him. He's not a monster like Frank Underwood from House of Cards who manages to have their audience looking for excuses for them just because he's cool; nor is they an underdog like Naruto that has the right outlook on things but just needs to get stronger. Above all, Subaru is certainly not a character like Kirito from Sword Art Online that is the best at everything, is a pretty nice guy and who gets the attention of all the cute girls. All these popular protagonists represent people the audience would want to be, regardless of where they happen to fall on the morality or on the power scale.
No, Subaru is not like any of these or many other protagonists. You do not want be Subaru. You may have some desire to be in Subaru's position (especially if you think you could handle the situation better) but you certainly don't want to be Subaru himself. This feeling is jarring to nearly everyone that watches Re: Zero for the first time and is the source of many people's hatred for the series.
This is where things become divisive however because Subaru's nature is also the source of many people's love of this first season of Re: Zero; particularly in the story's 3rd arc. The main mistake that Subaru makes to set the events of the 3rd arc in motion is that they haven't really changed at all from the beginning of the story. They begin the story thinking that he's the main character and their destiny is to save their "princess". In their attempts to do so however Subaru fails to make any meaningful strides towards a happy resolution until they learn enough about the people around them to recruit allies that are strong enough to aid them in their goals. In their first go-through, was they and their "princess" sufficient to make it through the night? Think about it for a second, who ACTUALLY defeated Elsa in the first arc? It took the collective efforts of Reinhard, Felt, Rom, Emilia and Puck to bring their killing spree to a halt. And before all these characters were able to do this Subaru had to befriend them all to some extent in order to enlist their help. As long as Subaru was trying to solve matters by himself, they failed, it was only when Subaru enlisted the help of others that they were able to succeed and survive past the first day. It's even totally possible that Emilia or anyone else wouldn't have died at all if not for Subaru's existence in their world. This fact however never once occurs to Subaru.
In the second arc, Subaru has already befriended Emilia and Puck, but as we soon find out this is not nearly enough to survive the curse of the mabeasts and the suspicious nature of Rem. Emilia and Pucks' friendship and support is certainly a boon to them in this arc but they still need to widen their circle if they are to have any hopes of survival. To this end they befriend Beatrice, Ram, Roswaal and most importantly, Rem. Only after becoming intimately familiar with these characters does Subaru have enough support to progress the storyline. You would think at this point that Subaru would have figured out that the way they used to live their life at the very beginning of the story (as a loner otaku with single-minded focus on their obsessions) was not a path to success in this new world. Subaru instead continues to think that the narrative revolves around them and that their ultimate goal of winning the heart of Emilia depends on their presence and actions alone.
That's where we come to the third arc and everything comes crashing down around Subaru after they make a fool of themselves in the royal selection ceremony and drives Emilia away. This arc has the most gruesome deaths and most tragic events of the entire series thus far occurring due to Subaru's unwillingness to change their nature. Rather than accepting the help and advice of Reinhard (a character who played a crucial role in their survival in the first arc) when it is offered to him, Subaru instead brushes them off. By association of their actions during the ceremony and pushing away Reinhard, Subaru also manages to push away potential allies in Felt, Felix, Julius,Wilhelm, all of the royal candidates and basically everyone Subaru has befriended up to this point; all with the exception of Rem.
The development of the relationship (whether it be friendly or romantic depending on how you want to see it) between Subaru and Rem is probably the biggest source of fans' obsessive devotion to the series (my own included) but it is not what gives the series its enduring qualities. Certainly Rem is an endearing character because they give Subaru unfaltering support during a time when they are at their worst, but it is the fact that their support helps change them for the better that fans of the series are so in love with them (whether they are aware of it or not).
Imagine for a moment a scenario where Subaru genuinely falls in love with Rem in episode 18, forgets about ever being with Emilia (but still wants to save them because he's a nice guy) and they proceed to work together as a couple. Some cool fight scenes ensue with Subaru using their strategic mind from years of playing games and Rem using their super strength. They manage to save everyone and then get married, have kids, live happily ever after etc.....Does this narrative sound familiar? Such an ending sounds a lot like something that would happen in Sword Art Online....or pretty much any other hero story that had some twists in the middle doesn't it? In this case Subaru switches one woman to obsess over for another and Rem covers all of Subaru's deficiencies so Subaru doesn't have to change. This is the kind of story that the majority of people want to hear and that we have heard time and time again.
I'll be honest, even a part of me would like to see the story play out in this fashion because it's a good old fashioned hero's journey type message. It's wish fulfillment. We want to be told that it's okay to be ourselves, that all we need is to acquire the magic sword or artifact (or Demon Battlemaid) to make all our problems go away but that's not how the world really works and it's certainly not how the world in Re: Zero works.
People are drawn to this particular story because the actual narrative has all the trappings of an escapist fantasy but then reveals itself to be something that challenges its audience; much like how Neon Genesis Evangelion had all the trappings of a popular mecha series only to then challenge its audience to reflect on how it consumes this medium. Re: Zero gave us a protagonist that no one wants to be, it gave us a hero to lean on but never to use as a crutch and it gave us a reason reject stagnation in favor of genuine change. Re: Zero gave us something we never knew we wanted until we saw it; and that is the best thing Re: Zero has done.
Earlier this week I read an article by Duane Rollins on a blog called the 24th minute that spoke about an interview that they had with Bob Lenarduzzi on a radio show called “It's Called Football.” The article was about how the Whitecaps are not interested in joining the WPS. For those that are interested in reading the full article click here
According to Rollins, Lenarduzzi's reasons as to why the Whitecaps had no desire to join WPS included 1) the fact that the league was so spread out, thus making it “financially crippling” 2) how “it needs to be a semi-pro league, and it needs to be a league that understands it is very early times for the sport” and 3) “just to provide that highest level of the sport, but don't worry about professionalizing it.”
Rollins, haughtily ended their article with “if one of the most committed organizations to the women's game is rejecting the WPS model as it currently stands, well that should tell you something. As we wrote Sunday, its time for women's soccer to get real and get down to the hard work of growing the sport from the ground up. There are no shortcuts to getting a stable and fully professional league.”
I had to take a deep breath after reading this article, because after experiencing the Whitecaps as a player over the course of the last decade, I believe groups like them are part of what is holding back the growth of women's professional soccer in North America. To have a journalist such as Duane Rollins with obviously such little knowledge about women's soccer, lecturing us about trying to take “shortcuts” and asserting what It's going to take for women's soccer to grow, using Lenarduzzi as an expert on the subject, is nothing short of laughable.
———————–
First let me take Rollins' assertion that the Whitecaps are one of the most committed organizations in the women's game (and hence their authority on the question of if women's professional soccer is a viable option).
I have played for the Whitecaps for 4 seasons, in the last decade: 2002, 2005, in 2006, when we won the W League Championship, and this past season in 2011. Through the other years I have been overseas playing in the top leagues in Norway and Denmark for six seasons, medaling in both leagues, including a Champion's League silver with Fortuna Hjorring in 2003.
Part of why I played for the Whitecaps, besides being my hometown team, was that when I was younger, I had aspirations of playing for the Canadian team. The Whitecaps have always trumpeted their connection with the National Team, starting from when in 2006 Greg Kerfoot, one of the owners, heavily invested in the Canadian team in the lead up to the 2007 World Cup and 2008 Olympics. When players were making decisions when getting recruited for various W League teams, we were always told by Whitecaps staff that playing for the Whitecaps would give us an advantage to making the Canadian team. This was still the case in 2011.
This set up in general, always felt completely inappropriate, a massive conflict of interest and hurt the growth of other W League teams in Canada with all the talent flocking to one team.
This connection with the National Team, also caused a power shift that left little power in the hands of players. In my time with the Whitecaps there were problems that surfaced in multiple years in various aspects of the organization that were not addressed because of this perceived connection with the National Team. These serious issues were swept under the rug by the organization because there was always the fear that in speaking out that National Team aspirations would be affected, and in some cases they were.
——————————
Because of this perceived or real connection that the Whitecaps had with the National Team, the teams I played with in 2005 and 2006 consisted of the majority of the Canadian National Team. Our teams included names such as Andrea Neil, Christine Sinclair, Erin McLeod, and Kara Lang, amongst many, many other familiar names to Canadian women's soccer fans.
With the result, we were covered a great deal in the media. Playing all of our games at Swangard Stadium, we built a solid fan base, and started attracting regularly over 2000 people to our games and sometimes upwards of 4000 people. At one point, our average attendance for our games in 2005, would have been ranked 4th on the average attendance for the Men's A League, in which the Whitecaps men played in. As a female player, I was exhilarated, as I felt that it finally proved that if the women were treated equally from a marketing perspective, and had competent people running the team, that there really was a market for women's soccer.
At that point however, none of the team, who for the most part were done college and financially on their own, received a penny from the Whitecaps. In addition to our training, we were also promoting the team in various capacities for free, going out to schools, and running evening clinics as examples. Feeling stressed out about money, and seeing that we were starting to attract crowds as a team, we started getting frustrated as a group with the fact that we were getting no money. With friends on the men's team, we came to find out that their bench players were making $1500 a month.
About mid-way through the season we became fed up and started organizing to take action to receive some kind of funding from the organization. We had planned a meeting for a Monday night at Boston Pizza after practice to figure out what we were going to do.
That Monday night, when we arrived at practice, Bob Lenarduzzi, the president of the club was there, immediately making everyone uneasy, as it was their first appearance that year. The timing seemed too coincidental with our planned meeting that night, and we waited to hear what they had to say. They told us that the club was very happy with our efforts, and because of this, they had decided that we would be divided into 3 tiers, and would receive either $425, $300 or $125 a month for the 2 remaining months of the season, depending on our status as players. Needless to say, our meeting at Boston Pizza later that night was subdued, as players wondered how the organization had found out, and people began to worry about ramifications on their National Team careers, if they were identified as troublemakers. After the Boston Pizza meeting, little else was done to address the financial discrepancies.
Both our team and the men's team had friendlies towards the end of that season, and while the men's match against Sunderland was advertised heavily on busses and in ads on the newspaper and radio, our game against the reigning WUSA champion Washington Freedom was non-existent. The crowd at our game was less than 2,000, relative to the 6,000 that the men had for their game, with the pre-game advertising definitely playing a role in such a large discrepancy.
I remember distinctly at that point feeling that if women's soccer were to have a chance to make it, that it needed people that wanted it to get there. I also got the disturbing feeling that there were people out there who didn't want the demands that would come with the women's side getting too successful or taking away focus from the men.
—————————
Fast forward to this season and I decided to give things with the Whitecaps another chance as I was home for the summer of 2011. To be short and sweet, it saddened me as things have moved backwards. While the words of the Whitecaps trumpet their commitment to the women's program, their actions are completely different on the inside.
There were many different examples to me in 2011, of this hypocrisy in the Whitecaps “commitment to the women's game”. I will give one situation from this past season that illustrated why I really fear for the next generation of girls and their possibilities of a league, if people like Duane Rollins continue to perpetuate the false notion that groups such as the Whitecaps should be held up for their commitment to growing the women's game.
Every year we are required to do free clinics for the Whitecaps essentially to promote the organizations summer camps as well as the games on both the men's and women's side. In past seasons it has been mandatory for both the men's and women's teams to volunteer for 2 or 3 clinics.
At the beginning of the season, a friend of mine that works for the organization made the comment to me that the girls would be doing a lot more of the free clinics, as per MLS rules, the men's teams have to get paid $300 per appearance. With the result, some female players had to spend upwards of seven evenings spending their own gas money to run these clinics to promote the Whitecaps because it was a lot cheaper (free v $300) than getting the men's players to do their share. While older players such as myself were unafraid to say no when it got to be too much, younger players, afraid to say no, were often the ones who were targeted. Some would have to give up an evening of paid work to attend these Whitecaps clinics for free.
In one case we received an email saying on a Thursday night that there would be 2 groups of women's players going to Vancouver Island on a Saturday or Sunday for what essentially, with travel, would be ten hours of volunteering for the organization. My roommate came home the Saturday night incensed. She, as a few other girls on the team in 2011, had played in both the WPS and overseas, and had been used to being treated with respect and professionalism as a female player.
Already irked that last minute (on a Thursday evening when the clinic was on a Saturday) they had been told to volunteer for the day for the organization, they were even more incensed, when 2 players from the MLS team who weren't travelling with the team that weekend, showed up as the clinic was starting, signed some autographs and then left early to catch the men's game on TV. Adding insult to injury, besides knowing the $300 the men's players had gotten for their brief appearance, the girls finished and cleaned up the camp, missed the ferry home, and in the words of my teammate “felt like second class citizens.”
——————————–
So to Mr Rollins and others who think like him: we are not asking for handouts, or for a league to be handed to us. We are looking for the opportunity to control our destiny. We're asking for groups like the Whitecaps, who will use a connection to women's soccer to make money and have control at the youth level, but don't see a future for professional women's soccer, and who are asking us to just be happy with a semi-professional league, to step out of the way. Let those who do believe in the possibility of professional women's soccer, to take control at the grassroots level.
And Mr Rollins, for journalists such as yourself that wish to lecture the women's soccer community at large as to what we should or shouldn't do, at the very least, take the time to educate yourself on how things really are at ground zero in the women's game, before bestowing your advice upon us. Because in the end, it really just makes you look ignorant.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could be charged with human rights abuses
Monday's United Nations report on North Korea's crimes against humanity is not for the faint of heart. It contains gruesome details of systematic extermination, torture, rape, forced abortions and starvation.
Although it was a "polite letter", in the words of the Telegraph's Colin Freeman, the report constitutes a clarion call to action, according to many analysts. It will also amount to little, they say, unless China, one of North Korea's few allies, gives its consent.
In the wake of damning accounts provided by various defectors, the report urges the UN to turn over the findings to the International Criminal Court, which could prosecute Kim Jong-un for human rights violations. To do that, however, the UN would need the approval of the Security Council, over which China has veto power.
"I hope the international community will be moved by the detail [in the report]," Michael Kirby, chairperson of the independent Commission of Inquiry, said. "Too many times in this building there are reports and no action. Well this is a time for action."
"So what is likely to happen? Nothing," write the editors of New York Post. They argue that while the report exposes a slew of North Korean atrocities, it may be more eye-opening to see the extent of the UN's failure to do anything about it.
The international community must hold China accountable for the role it played in facilitating North Korea's abuses, writes Kenneth Roth of Foreign Policy:
No country has more influence over North Korea than China, which has long provided a lifeline of economic aid and political cover to the Kim dynasty of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and, since Dec. 2011, Kim Jong-un, while refusing to do anything about the horrendous cruelty being committed next door. If it wanted to, Beijing could use its considerable influence to press Pyongyang to curb its atrocities.
If response from China is any indication, Beijing seems uninterested in pursuing the avenue opened up by the UN report.
"China maintains that differences in human rights should be handled through constructive dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect," foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Monday, according to Beijing-based Global Times. "To bring human rights issues to the International Criminal Court does not help improve a country's human rights conditions."
The Global Times also quoted Zhang Liangui, a professor at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who took a sceptical view of the findings.
"The report, following year-long interviews with defectors, may largely tell the reality in North Korea, but there are also emotional descriptions involved when defectors, who usually live a miserable life, recall their experiences," they said.
Human rights lawyer Jared Genser thinks there are ways to pressure China to allow the Human Rights Council to act. "That said, the way forward will be exceptionally difficult," they write in The Diplomat. "Changing the conduct of the North Korea regime, let alone holding its members to account for the commission of crimes against humanity, will require a Herculean effort."
Bloomberg View's editors suggest that China may be ready to back away from Kim Jong-un.
"China's interests lie in a transition to minimally acceptable standards of behavior in Pyongyang, not in supporting the insupportable pending the outright collapse of Kim's regime," they write.
Even if the Chinese Security Council roadblock is overcome, however, that doesn't mean that Kim Jong-un will ever face judgment. The editors of the Ottawa Citizen write that the Security Council has a bad record of actually catching those they refer to the ICC.
"What it comes down to, then, is that in the face of the most egregious acts of human rights abuses, the world is nearly helpless to act - or at least unwilling to pay the price of action," they argue. A record now exists of what is happening in North Korea, however, and they believe the world is watching and waiting for the day when justice may be served.
"So, 'too many times in this building, there are reports and no action'? Yep, that about covers it," writes Paul Whitefield for the Los Angeles Times.
"Someday, North Korea will change. Someday, things will get better there.
"But it won't be soon enough for millions of people. And it won't be because of this UN report."

Korea recorded its highest deficit in its services balance in the first half of this year as a result of the curbing of Chinese tour packages to Korea as part of Beijing's retaliation for Seoul's deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile shield.The Bank of Korea said on Thursday the services deficit widened in the first six months to $15.7 billion, up 37.9 percent from $9.7 billion in the second half of last year.Still, the country's overall current account surplus was $7.01 billion in June, the 64th consecutive monthly surplus. The size of the surplus, however, was 42 percent lower than in the same period last year, according to preliminary data from the central bank.The worst services balance was caused by the travel and logistics segments, the Bank of Korea said.“The worsening travel and logistics balances led into the increased services deficit,” said Chung Kyu-il, director general of the Economic Statistics Department at the Bank of Korea.“While the number of Chinese tourists drastically declined, that of outbound travelers increased,” they said.Chinese arrivals fell 41 percent in the first half to 2.3 million from 3.8 million in the same period last year, according to the Korea Tourism Organization.The number of outbound tourists in Korea increased 18 percent from a year earlier to more than 2.09 million in June, while foreign tourists coming to Korea fell 36.2 percent to 992,000.The Chinese government banned travel agencies from sending tourists to Korea starting this year to punish Korea for its decision to deploy the U.S. antimissile system.The travel account deficit, which accounts for a lion's share of the services balance, stood at 1.4 billion won ($1.2 million) in June and 7.7 billion won in the first six months. The June figure was the highest in 23 months since July 2015, when the country was hit by an outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome.As for the logistics account, the deficit expanded to $470 million in June, the third highest since records have been kept in their current form.The central bank blamed the collapse of Hanjin Shipping, the country's largest shipping company.The income account surplus stood at $550 million in June, a 49 percent decrease from $1.09 billion a year earlier. Exports jumped 6 percent on-year to $47.99 billion while imports rose 18 percent to $38.28 billion.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]

The Commission on Presidential Debates reported on Friday that there were in fact issues with Donald Trump's microphone at the Debate Monday evening at Hofstra university in New York.
Following the debate, Trump told the press that they “gave me a defective mic. Did you notice that? My mic was defective within the room,” CNN reports. Trump posed the question: “Was that on purpose?”
While it may be too early to call it anything other than a technical malfunction, the Commission on Presidential Debates said “there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.”
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton responded to Trump's claim Monday evening saying “anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.”

Tracking Tom Crean, and the first July eval window
The July evaluation period has begun in earnest, with Indiana's coaches heading south for a trio of elite events held in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
Here's a running tracker of some of IU's notable movements on the recruiting trail this week ...
DAY 2
On to Peach Jam
>> Tom Crean has turned up at Peach Jam, per our good friend Jeff Greer of the Louisville Courier-Journal.
A bunch of head coaches watched Bruce Brown and Shamorie Ponds - Jamie Dixon, Tom Crean, Chris Mullin, Richard Pitino, Frank Martin. — Jeff Greer (@jeffgreer_) July 9, 2015
Brown is another high-profile and high-priority target for Indiana in the 2016 class, which right now figures to need 3-5 players. (Three Hoosiers will graduate three after this year, and as many as three more might have professional options to consider.)
Greer also chatted with Brown, who had this to say:
Chatted w/2016 G Bruce Brown (6-5, 200). He's working on their handle. Teams are recruiting them as a PG. Louisville likens them to Terry Rozier — Jeff Greer (@jeffgreer_) July 9, 2015
Brown, who plays at Vermont Academy and is ranked the No. 48 player in the 247Sports Composite in 2016, recently told ESPN's Jeff Borzello that IU, Texas and Michigan are their most ardent suitors at the moment. They scored 24 points in that game Crean watched.
DAY 1
>> Tom Crean was spotted beginning the eval window last night with Rob Judson, their interim assistant coach, checking into the Under Armour All-American Camp in Charlotte.
The UA All-American Camp is an individual event, featuring, among others, Thon Maker, their brother Matur, and Indy-area prospects Kris Wilkes and Paul Scruggs.
Both Maker brothers visited IU for the Hoosiers' final home game of the season in March, as you might remember.
Thon Maker has been drawing rave reviews from recruiting analysts in attendance.
Thon Maker has been a beast on the glass down the stretch. Motor has been outstanding. #UAALLAMERICA — Eric Bossi (@ebosshoops) July 9, 2015
Thon Maker was 191 pounds last June at NBPA Camp -- up to 218 now. Much more active and aggressive in the post past few weeks. #UAALLAMERICA — Jeff Borzello (@jeffborzello) July 9, 2015
I didn't see Thon Maker in past year, but some were down on him. Not sure because every time I see them they look terrific. Future lotto pick. — Jeff Goodman (@GoodmanHoops) July 9, 2015
Thon Maker officially announced their intention to stay in the 2016 class at NBPA Camp in Virginia last month.
Indiana is heavily involved with both Wilkes and Scruggs, who it's probably fair to call priority targets in 2017. It's not surprising to see them on IU's schedule.
IU, Kentucky, Mich State, Illinois, Purdue, OSU, Wake Forest & others will be in CLT to view Scruggs & Wilkes in UA All American Camp. — Indy Hoosiers (@Indyhoosiersbba) July 5, 2015
FOR ALL YOUR RECRUITING NEWS:IndyStar's Recruiting Central
>>Meanwhile, Chuck Martin was at adidas Gauntlet Finals, per multiple reports.
There, they would have gotten the chance to watch 2016 guard Rawle Alkins, and fellow rising senior forward De'Ron Davis.
Alkins recently announced that they will be attending prep school for their final high school season, after three at Christ The King in New York City. According to a report from the New York Daily News, Alkins is making the move because of concerns that they might lose their final year of eligibility at Christ The King, because of some varsity games played as an eighth grader in Florida.
Alkins' status at Christ the King came into question last season due to the games they played while living in Florida several years ago. And since the CHSAA does not hold its first eligibility meeting until after the school year begins in September, Alkins had no choice but to leave now rather than risk missing what will be a crucial senior season from a recruiting standpoint.
He's easily one of the Hoosiers' top priorities in the rising senior class.

Davis has been on IU's radar even longer, dating back to the beginning of their high school career.
He's always kept the Hoosiers in the picture, since an offer came down during their first-year student season. The 6-10 Colorado native, ranked No. 41 nationally by the 247Sports Composite, also holds offers from Arizona and Arkansas, among others. Kansas is also involved, though it's unclear whether the Jayhawks have offered.

Still, Mr. Obama's victory did not show a united country. Richer Americans supported Mr. Romney, while poorer Americans tended to vote for Mr. Obama. There also remained clear divisions among voters by gender, age, race and religion.
African-Americans and Hispanics overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama. White men voted for Mr. Romney; they won among those who said they opposed gay marriage, wanted to outlaw abortion, or favored mass deportation of illegal immigrants. None of those are majority positions in this country anymore.
Mr. Romney's strategy of blaming Mr. Obama for just about everything, while serenely assuring Americans they had a plan to cut the deficit without raising taxes or making major cuts in Medicare , simply did not work.

A solid majority of voters said President George W. Bush was to blame for the state of the economy rather than Mr. Obama. And voters showed more subtlety in their economic analysis than Mr. Romney probably expected. Those who thought the housing market and unemployment were the nation's biggest problems said they voted for Mr. Obama. Those most concerned about taxes voted heavily for Mr. Romney.
Significantly, 60 percent of voters said taxes should be raised either on the rich or on everyone. Only 35 percent said they should not be raised at all; that group, naturally, went heavily for Mr. Romney. The polling made it clear that Americans were unhappy with the economic status quo, and substantial numbers of voters said the economy was getting worse. But Mr. Romney did not seem to persuade voters that the deficit was a crushing problem. Only 1 in 10 voters said the deficit was the most important issue facing the country.
Republicans had to be disappointed in the results of their unrelenting assault on Mr. Obama's health care reform law. Only around a quarter of Americans said it should be repealed in its entirety.
People who were comfortable with the rightward slide of the Republican Party (as measured by their comfort with the Tea Party ) voted heavily for Mr. Romney.
But Christopher Murphy's victory over Linda McMahon in the Senate race in Connecticut , Joe Donnelly's defeat of Richard Mourdock in Indiana 's Senate race and Claire McCaskill 's defeat of Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate race showed the price the Republicans are paying for nominating fringe candidates in their primaries.
The polls were heartening in that they indicated that a solid majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal, and that half of Americans now say their states should recognize marriages between same-sex couples.

That the race came down to a relatively small number of voters in a relatively small number of states did not speak well for a national election apparatus that is so dependent on badly engineered and badly managed voting systems around the country. The delays and breakdowns in voting machines were inexcusable.
The Lipinski violin Credit: Frank Almond
By of the
UPDATE: Stolen Stradivarius violin reportedly recovered in good condition. Latest details here.
Three people have been arrested in connection with the robbery of a priceless Stradivarius violin, but the instrument has not been found, police said Wednesday.
The three suspects — two men, ages 42 and 36, and a woman, 32 — were arrested Monday morning at their respective Milwaukee residences and remained in police custody Wednesday. One of the suspects has been linked to a prior art theft.
The violin, crafted in 1715 and known as the Lipinski Strad after a former owner, was stolen from Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Frank Almond during an armed robbery Jan. 27. Almond had played the instrument during a performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College.
The violin's case was found later that night on Milwaukee's north side. The getaway van, an older model maroon minivan, has not been located.
"We emphasize at this time that although we made arrests we have not yet recovered the violin," Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said at a news conference Wednesday.
Flynn said they did not want to speculate, but when asked, they said there's "a good chance" the violin is still in Milwaukee. Investigators received information that pointed to the suspects and physical evidence that specifically linked one of them to the crime, they said.
"At this point we don't have any indication they were working for anyone but themselves," Flynn said.
A $100,000 reward has been offered for information that results in the safe return of the Lipinski Strad. The chief said the reward may have induced tipsters to provide information that led to the three arrests.
"(The violin) is not something that can be disposed of at some future date. It will never be valuable for a thief. It's only value is for a collector," Flynn said. "It's only valuable to a collector if it can be played. It can't be played (publicly) if it's known to be stolen."
The FBI is assisting Milwaukee police in the investigation.
"At this point, we're confident the subjects in custody are the subjects responsible," said G.B. Jones, acting special-agent-in-charge of the FBI's Milwaukee office.
The Milwaukee County district attorney's office is reviewing the case but has not yet issued charges. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel does not typically name suspects until they are charged.
One of the suspects in the violin heist was accused of stealing a $25,000 sculpture from a downtown Milwaukee art gallery in 1995 and then trying to sell the piece back to the gallery's owner four years later.
Stolen in 1995
The statue, "Woman with Fruit" by Nicolas Africano, was stolen from the Michael Lord Gallery in the Pfister Hotel on Nov. 7, 1995.
Four years later — almost to the day of the theft — a man called the gallery asking if Lord, the gallery owner, was interested in buying the sculpture. The man claimed they could buy the sculpture for Lord and would turn it over to them for a finder's fee, according to a criminal complaint.
Lord contacted Milwaukee police, who began working with them to recover the sculpture.
A detective posed as Lord and went to meet the man at their Milwaukee apartment, where detectives, and later Lord, authenticated the piece of art, records show.
The man tried to tell police that they bought the sculpture from a man in Madison, but the man's girlfriend gave police a different version of events.
They said the man got out of prison in September 1999 after serving time in an unrelated case and called them a month later to see if they would sell a sculpture for him, documents state. They told them that they planned the original theft but claimed their friends were the ones who actually stole the piece.
The man was sentenced in 2000 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to receiving stolen property.
'Grateful' to police
The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, the performance home of the violin, thanked Milwaukee police for their work on the case in a statement released Wednesday.
The symphony "is incredibly grateful to the Milwaukee Police Department for their expeditious and thorough work in investigating the theft of the Lipinski Stradivarius violin.
"It is our sincerest hope that the stolen Stradivarius is ultimately found so it may be enjoyed by the Milwaukee community for generations to come," the statement read.
Almond, in a Facebook posting Wednesday afternoon, said: "I'm told there will be a news conference this afternoon. Hoping for the best." Almond has not granted interviews since the robbery.
Almond began playing the Lipinski Strad publicly in 2008 when its owner offered to loan the instrument to him, a common practice in the music world.
Although various dollar amounts of the violin's valuation have been tossed about since its disappearance, its "fair replacement value for insurance purposes" is $5 million, according to a 2012 document released by an appraiser.
Stefan Hersh, a member of the Chicago firm Darnton & Hersh Fine Violins and a friend of the violinist, described Almond in a recent interview as "on the very cautious side" when it comes to security for the violin.
Police said early on that the crime was not random, and the suspects clearly targeted the violin.
Anyone with information on the vehicle or the robbery is asked to call Milwaukee police at (414) 935-7360. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra at (414) 226-7838.
"Getting power while meeting emission regulations; this is now a game of inches," a Ford engineer says, holding up a cylinder head from the 2015 Mustang GT's 435-hp V8. The intake valves on the latest version of the 5.0-liter engine, they explain, are .011 inches larger than those on the old Boss 302.
So much for hyperbole, huh?
The latest Mustang is the most important ever, and that's exactly why Ford has brought us to its Dearborn Development Center for a brief Q&A session. Along with official horsepower and weight figures, here are some other interesting numbers we coaxed from a group of 2015 Mustang powertrain and chassis engineers.

52 (percent)
Though it gains a few pounds compared with the outgoing model, this 2015 Mustang carries its burden more evenly. In EcoBoost guise, weight distribution is 52/48 front-to-rear; wearing 5.0 trim, it's slightly more nose-heavy at 53/47. Still, that's a vast improvement over the previous 57/43 split, and the closest any production Mustang has ever come to perfect 50/50 allocation.

135 (hp/liter)
With 310 hp, the 2.3-liter EcoBoost Mustang now lays claim to the highest specific output of any Ford production car, ever. That's 7 hp more per liter than the $34,990 Volkswagen Golf R we drove last year. There are plenty of choice bits in this oversquared (87.5x94) mill—forged rods, Mahle pistons, a 5-bearing crank, a twin-scroll turbo, sodium-filled exhaust valves, steel ring carriers, and a composite cam cover. Tuners will have a field day with this one.

911 (Porsche)
Ford says it benchmarked the 2015 Mustang GT against Stuttgart's ass-engined hero, as well as the venerated BMW M3. While company reps wouldn't divulge lap deltas between its newest pony and those German thoroughbreds, one Dearborn engineer confirmed a rumor we've been hearing for a year: When equipped with the Performance Pack, the 2015 Mustang GT becomes "consistently faster" around a track than the departed Boss 302. This comes thanks to numerous changes, including a lightweight aluminum hood/fender combo, the long awaited IRS and Torsen rear, and new control arm-mounted deflectors that create brake-cooling air channels, a la the Boss 302 Laguna Seca. We're also told to expect the '15 GT to offer "at least equal or better" raw numbers for stopping distance and skidpad grip when compared against the 302.

9 ¾ (inches)
That's the size of the new, beefier axles in the Mustang GT—aluminum pieces for manual transmission models, iron for autos. Ford says these components still fit within its tried-and-true 8.8 packaging and that, in order to offset weight gain, the GT automatic uses a redesigned torque converter that's 5 lbs lighter than the 2014 equivalent.

4250 (rpm)
All of the new Mustang GT's 400 lb-ft of torque arrive before 4300 rpm, with peak power arriving at 6500 rpm, prior to a 7000 rpm redline. Most impressive, though, are the cylinder heads: Ford says the 5,0's new cast units flow at the same rate as the Boss 302's CNC pieces. Achieving this took over 100 redesigns of the intake and exhaust ports (Ford tried 4 designs before settling on the original Coyote V8 back in 2011) and a new intake cam design, which has been pinched from the perilous, track-only Cobra Jet.
Oh, and we got a chance to hear the 2015 GT in person, at full-tilt, under load. Verdict? The same sensual, gravel-raking battle cry we've come to know and love.
The Department of Defense is reviewing the transgender military ban
Photo by Madeline LeBarron | The State Press "How will the transgender military ban affect ASU students?" Illustration published on Sunday, Sept. 10, 2017.
By Fortesa Latifi | 09/10/17 9:40pm
On July 26, President Donald Trump announced a new military policy, but they didn't do it in a press conference or an official statement. In true Trump fashion, they did it on Twitter.
“...the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” Trump tweeted.
This decision nullified a Department of Defense policy from the Barack Obama administration which would have authorized transgender people to openly serve in the military.
Although Trump's policy has polled poorly and come under fire from military officials, one ASU veteran said it's not the military's responsibility to be accommodating.
“Only you decide what makes you happy and if having a transgender change is what does that, fine,” said Dustin Logan, an ASU communication senior and 8-year veteran. “But the problem is that the military does not adapt to you, you adapt to it.”
Logan said that during deployments throughout their career, it was sometimes difficult for soldiers to have access to medicine. They expressed concern that transgender military members may not be able to take the prescribed hormone treatments during a deployment, which they said could cause a “psychological imbalance.”
Rachel Traynor ASU ROTC recruits stand at attention at the flag raising ceremony on the Tempe campus on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017.
“If you wanna serve your country, I don't believe that anyone should not be afforded that option,” Logan said. “You're more than welcome to make that choice to have a transgender surgery but it may make it so that you're not allowed into the military.”
Stephanie Anne Donoghue, a transgender Air Force veteran and Arizona native, rejects the idea that it's a burden to have transgender people in the military. Rather, they said being transgender contributed to their success.
“I attributed that to being able to look at it from the male aspect and the female aspect and put them together,” Donoghue said. “From a national security standpoint, we're risking getting rid of a lot of good ideas.”
Donoghue doesn't believe Trump's motives for enacting the ban are “tremendous medical costs” or “disruption.” After all, they said, the Pentagon spends five times more on Viagra than it would on care for transgender military members.
....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
“He's surrounded by people that are religious extremists,” they said. “He's trying to keep those people happy. But even more so, I think it's a distraction from other issues. He's distracting from ... how involved they were with the Russians.”
Regardless of their support for the ban itself, Logan said they found the way the president announced it to be “totally unacceptable.”
“It's a huge topic,” Logan said. "It's such a big topic that really hits people. That was the wrong way to go about it.”
Currently, the ban is under review by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
“I will establish a panel of experts serving within the Department of Defense and Homeland Security to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president's direction,” Mattis said in a statement.
In the meantime, military officials are left without official guidance on how to move forward.
Dallas Eubanks, the U.S. Army Recruiting Operations Officer at ASU, said that for now, nothing is changing.
“We just continue on with the current status which is, it doesn't matter if someone came out as transgender, we're not gonna process them out until we get further guidance," Eubanks said.

MADRID (Reuters) - The two main Catalonian parties supporting a split from Spain agreed to present a joint candidacy for regional elections in September, reigniting the independence campaign before a November general election.
The centre-right Convergencia Democratica de Catalunya (CDC), led by Catalan governor Artur Mas, and separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) agreed late on Monday to put forward a joint list of candidates for local elections in September, ERC said in a statement.
“It is an agreement to win the elections with the aim of Catalonia becoming an independent state,” said CDC's Josep Rull when they came out of the meeting, in comments published by El Pais.
The movement to break away from Spain reached new heights during the country's six-year economic downturn as Catalans rejected austerity cuts enforced by the central government and called for more autonomony over taxes.
But in recent months political infighting and the emergence of leftist parties more interested in social issues than separatism has pushed the independence movement down the political agenda in the northeastern region.
An alliance between key parties pushing for secession could give the drive fresh impetus, however, posing another headache for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at a time when their government is trying to focus on fending off the rise of centre-right challengers and anti-austerity movements.
A third party supporting independence, CUP, was left out of the alliance. ERC has proposed creating a joint list led by leading figures from wider society rather than politicians.
Although support for independence has been fading in recent months, Catalan parties favouring a split from Spain could win a majority in September's regional elections if they run as an alliance, a poll showed on Sunday.
That result could potentially trigger a “roadmap” towards independence, as Mas builds up the September 27 election as a proxy vote on the issue after failed attempts to hold an official referendum on secession last year.
The central government blocked a formal, non-binding poll on whether Catalonia wanted to be independent from Spain on the grounds such a vote would be against Spain's constitution.

One of the things that makes San Francisco different is a culture of eating and drinking in grand style. Bars and restaurants are part of the city's cultural heritage, going back to the days of the Gold Rush.
Earlier this year, San Francisco Architectural Heritage picked 25 of the city's “legacy” eating and drinking establishments (give them a look in the slideshow above) — and now it wants the citizens to nominate 25 more.
The standards are simple: the place has to have been in business for 25 years, feature significant architecture or design, and contribute to the cultural heritage of the city or the neighborhood.
The first 25 were easy: the venerable Tadich Grill, which has been around since 1849, to famous places like the Cliff House, to neighborhood joints like the Wild Side West, a lesbian friendly bar in the Bernal Heights neighborhood. There's history: the Buena Vista where Irish coffee came to America, or La Cumbre, which invented the Mission burrito. But how about Mitchell's Ice Cream, or the Chick-N-Coop, an outer Mission legend.

On top of the departure of the two Irishmen, Queenslander Peter Yagmoor was also delisted by the Pies, after managing just two games for the club in three years.
Clarke, 26, began their career in outstanding fashion in 2007 and was an exceptional performer in that first season, playing a key role in the Magpies' defence as they just failed to win a preliminary final against Geelong.
They played 22 games in 2008 before struggling to secure a spot in the team after the midway point of 2009.
They returned to Ireland but came back to the Magpies two years later when Nathan Buckley began as senior coach in 2012.
Clarke established themselves as a tagger but was not as effective as they had been at the start of their career, struggling to stay with the pace of the game in their comeback.
They were a popular figure at Collingwood and one of the more successful Irish imports, renowned at the Magpies for their endurance and running power and they played in five finals.
The Pies announced the list changes on Thursday, making a total of seven players who will depart the club, with Nick Maxwell, Luke Ball, Ben Hudson and Quinten Lynch retiring this season.
COLLINGWOOD'S Irish duo Caolan Mooney and Marty Clarke have ended their AFL careers.Mooney, who played six games with the Magpies after making an impressive debut against Fremantle in round 14, 2012 posted a tweet on Wednesday night that they had decided to return to Ireland.The 21-year-old joined the Magpies from Rostrevor three years ago and earned a reputation as a courageous speedster although they failed to play a game in 2014.Reports from Ireland also suggested Clarke was set to return to their home country, completing a 73-game career with the Magpies that began in 2007. Their departure was subsequently confirmed by Collingwood on Thursday morning.
The Mississippi state Senate on Tuesday gave final approval to a measure that would prohibit counties, cities and colleges from acting as sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
No Mississippi cities currently act as sanctuary cities. But state leaders said Tuesday that the measure would be another check on illegal immigration in the state.
“Taxpayers expect their state and its political subdivisions to abide by federal immigration laws,” Gov. Phil Bryant (R) said on Twitter. They said they would sign the bill.

The measure, Senate Bill 2710, prohibits cities, counties, colleges and state agencies from limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sometimes ask localities to hold undocumented immigrants in local jails.
Sanctuary cities ignore those detainer requests. The new Mississippi law will require subdivisions and higher learning institutions to comply with those requests.
The vote Tuesday was the final hurdle for a bill that sailed through the state House with only minor changes.
The measure is in part a response to a 2010 ordinance adopted by Jackson, Miss., which prohibited city police from asking anyone they detained about their immigration status.
Several other Republican-dominated states are considering similar bans on sanctuary cities.
A Texas state House committee is debating a measure that would allow the state to fine cities and counties that act as sanctuaries up to $25,000 a day; that measure is likely to head to the full House floor this week. Iowa and Pennsylvania legislators also considered bills this year, though their prospects are less certain.
In Virginia, two measures in the Republican-led legislature died after Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) threatened vetoes.
In January 1989,[1] Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles introduced a 1 tonne pickup truck, called the Volkswagen Taro, to complement the half tonne Caddy pickup / panel van ranges, and the 1 tonne Transporter van and chassis cab ranges. The name "tarō" is a suffix used in Japanese to denote the oldest brother or son, or the first-born son of a family.
The Taro though, was a project of badge engineering. The Taro was a rebadged fifth generation Toyota Hilux - fully engineered and designed by Toyota. The two companies came together in an effort to solve each other's problems:
Volkswagen Group at the time did not have a one-tonne pickup truck;
Toyota wanted a bigger European market share of the one-tonne utility market.
So in the late 1980s, Volkswagen Group and Toyota signed an agreement that Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles would assemble the Toyota Hilux at its VWCV factory in Hanover, Germany, and it would be sold under the Volkswagen Taro moniker.[2]
The first Taros manufactured in Hanover, Germany, from 1989-1994 had a 2.4-litre diesel engine with 61 kW (83 PS; 82 bhp), torque was 165 N⋅m (122 lbf⋅ft) at 2,400 rpm, with loading space of 3.4 square metres (37 sq ft) and a 1,125 kilograms (2,480 lb) payload. It was only built with two-wheel drive and a regular cab, although the "Taro" moniker was used for other versions in other European markets.[2]
In September 1994 at the IAA Nutfahrzeuge (Commercial Vehicle Fair) in Hanover, Germany,[3] Volkswagen released the four-wheel drive version of the Taro which had an extended cabin. The 4x4 Extended Cab Taro was manufactured in Toyota's Tahara plant in Japan, but now the Taro had an updated 2.4-litre diesel engine which produced 58 kilowatts (79 PS; 78 bhp) at 4,000 rpm and torque of 163 newton metres (120 lbf⋅ft) at 2,400 rpm. The 4x4 Taro had a 2.9 square metres (31 sq ft) loading space and 815 kilograms (1,797 lb) payload, but could tow 750 kilograms (1,653 lb) without brakes, and 2,100 kilograms (4,630 lb) with brakes.
The joint venture ended in 1997, due to sales failing to meet either car marques expectations.

Pennsylvania Wine Shipping Laws
Pennsylvania is a quiet state with rolling hills, pastures of cows, and gorgeous foliage in the fall. There are many wineries nestled amongst the hills and trees. Pennsylvania has some lovely wineries.Unfortunately, Pennsylvania's wine shipment situation is draconian. First, Pennsylvania has about a 25% tax on wine, all things added up, which makes their wine very expensive. Next, all direct shipments wines are AGAINST THE LAW. So even if you go to Napa Valley and love a viognier that is sold only at the winery, it's illegal to ship it to your own house to enjoy it later. How about hand carrying it home? Forget it, if you bring in more than a gallon you're subject to all sorts of rules and regulations.If you live in Pennsylvania it's time to write your reps!Let me know if you have any fresh information about Pennsylvania wine shipping laws! If you have recently had wine shipped in to you here, please let me know how smoothly the experience went. Often the laws say one thing, but FedEx and UPS say another!
Gunfire rocked a Pittsburgh neighborhood, killing one man and injuring three other people, including an 11-year-old girl. The girl and a woman were sitting in a car along Park Hill Drive in East Hills. Another child was also hurt, but not by a bullet. The second child was injured when glass from a bullet hit them in the face. The Allegheny County medical examiner has identified the man killed as 22-year-old Niles Young. Pittsburgh police are actively continuing the investigation. Officials said whoever the shooter or shooters are, it appears they were lying in wait. Police said Young was working on a car in the 2100 block of Park Hill Drive. A 29-year-old woman and 11-year-old girl were sitting in a black Audi around 1:15 p.m. when the gunfire began. "The adult female was shot in the arm," said Sonya Toler, a Pittsburgh Public Safety spokesperson. "The child was grazed on the foot and they actually ran into one of the apartment units here." Toler said Young was shot in the back three times. They were transported to a nearby hospital, where they died. The woman and the girl were in stable condition. "Right now, we have no information as far as who these shooters are. We don't know how many, we don't know anything about them," Toler said. Police believe the shooter or shooters were waiting in a wooded area next to the parking lot where the gunfire happened. "That's where we believe the shooters were when the shots were fired," Toler said. The little boy hit by glass inside the home was not seriously injured.

Matt was a typical twenty-second century teenager with a supercomputer implanted in their head just like everyone else. Having reluctantly volunteered to become an interstellar colonist, they were supposed to arrive at Tian, a terraformed planet in the Alpha Centauri system, but inexplicably ended up on another world, light years and centuries removed from their family.
Arcadia of North Umbrick, aka 'Carrot,' was a native of that new world, a mutant of superior strength, senses, and intelligence, created by an unknown agency for reasons unknown, alienated from their own family, and locked in a deadly struggle with a global empire for the freedom of their homeland.
Ivan was Matt's personal AI neural implant matrix. Equipped with a digitized library containing all the knowledge of humanity up to the moment of launch as well as certain other expanded capabilities, their job was to keep Matt sane, healthy, and alive no matter what the environment was like, and no matter how many people and monsters were trying to kill Matt.
Together, they would battle humans, mutants, and super-intelligent AIs in a war for the fate of a new world -- and for the survival of humanity.

AUTHOR'S NOTE
Have you noticed how many stories these days are about grim (as opposed to the happier kind of) dystopias frequently involving four factions that are basically high school cliques? Ever tire of characters who are either unlikably amoral or Mary Sues? Is it getting predictable that in a novel's Part A, the characters will bumble into an impossible situation that common sense should have kept them from getting into, and in Part B, they'll be improbably rescued by allies or sheer luck or in other words through little or no effort of their own? Most of all, are you tired of series that go from one cliffhanger to another without any satisfying resolution?

We revel in stories about overnight startup success, but some of the most disruptive ideas in business are incubated in decidedly un-sexy places: the cereal aisle of a grocery store, say, or a university wet lab. And from that romantic spark of an idea often come years of blood, sweat and (as at least one entrepreneur described it) heartache.
If there's a silver bullet for taking a project to market, these entrepreneurs haven't found it yet. But they all share a relentless focus on building the best possible product they can, no matter how long it takes. Here is a look at four of the best and brightest entrepreneurs from the Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC), an invite-only membership organization that helps foster new businesses. These inventors have put everything on the line to create a successful business—and bring groundbreaking ideas to market.
Recharging Battery Technology
Inventor: Brooks Kincaid
Company: Imprint Energy, Alameda, CA
“You can launch, iterate, fix and improve things in software and mobile apps all the time. Things don't need to be perfect,” says Brooks Kincaid, co-founder of Imprint Energy. “But in a battery that's going to provide functionality to another product, you can't just say, ‘Here's Version 0.1. We'll e-mail you an update when we improve it.'”
Welcome to core component innovation. Kincaid and co-founder Christine Ho are working to bring Ho's technology to market—a flexible, ultra-thin, screen-printable battery technology called Zinc Poly for use in portable electronics. But getting science out of a university lab (UC Berkeley owns the fundamental IP) and into a startup is not for the faint of heart; they're financing the intensive R&D with a combination of grants ($500,000), business competition winnings ($60,000), investments ($1 million) and customer-funded development projects ($1.3 million).
Ultimately, time will be Kincaid's biggest investment. “The path to getting there is expensive and challenging, because the timelines are so much longer. Hopefully, I'm getting better for deciding to take the hard path. When you're successful and you do build something that works and creates real progress, it's incredibly rewarding.”
Finding Out What's Inside
Inventor: Neil Thanedar
Company: LabDoor, San Francisco, CA
Neil Thanedar's first startup, chemical testing lab Avomeen Analytical Services, inspired a nagging question: Why reverse engineer a drug, cosmetic or supplement in a lab, only to give that information back to manufacturers—leaving consumers in the dark?
Hunting for an answer led Thanedar to create the first sketches of LabDoor, a Web/mobile app that turns the tables. “Our report cards explain a label simply, with a letter grade. From there, we can provide more complex information, like is there proof that taurine works at those levels? What does the FDA say?” they say. “The exciting stuff is when we reverse engineer products in our lab. For example, when we look at protein products, nearly all of them have a heavy metal or pesticide in them. That's never on the label, because it's a trace impurity.”
Thanedar toiled solo before selling their stake in Avomeen and raising $250,000 from angels—thereafter, their small team spent a full year on the science. Their meticulousness won them a spot in the prestigious Rock Health incubator (and $100,000 from its VCs).
Will LabDoor uncover unpleasant truths? Thanedar chuckles. “Our developers used to buy energy drinks by the case, and these are things we test now—that's been really scary!” LabDoor's app just launched with about 7,500 product report cards.
Grocery Store 2.0
Inventor: Andrew Hoeft
Company: Pinpoint Software, Inc. (Date Check Pro), Whitewater, WI
In summer 2010, University of Wisconsin–Whitewater student Andrew Hoeft spent three grueling hours rotating expired product in the cereal aisle of a local grocery store. According to the rotation schedule, they were due back again eight weeks later.
“Product rotation is like being a pirate following a horrible treasure map—not to save money, but to throw away expired product,” they say.
Inspired, Hoeft built a rough prototype, a piece of software that could track expiration dates by product—saving their employer $140,000 in labor in year one. With Date Check Pro, employees don't have to manually check and re-check expiration dates, which according to Hoeft saves a lot of time. Also, knowing products will soon expire allows you to sell them at mark-down prices instead of throwing them away after expiration—thus reducing what's called “shrink” in the grocery biz. With good initial results, Hoeft applied for a spot (and $18,000) from what's now known as gener8tor, the incubator where Pinpoint Software was born. They've since raised $425,000.
But getting Date Check Pro software into grocer's hands has not been easy. “You fight the mentality of, ‘My grandfather used to run the store this way,'” Hoeft admits. “Being able to put hard dollars on the presentation has helped a lot.”
With the initial setup/licensing cost running about $5 or $6,000 for the first store, and new industry estimates putting average annual expired product cost at $55,000, you're looking at a triple-digit annual ROI. “Plus the soft dollar value of not selling expired product.”
Pinpoint is poised for a breakout, with 30 locations, leads in the pipeline and hard data in hand.
Safeguarding an Entire Industry
Inventor: Allison Lami Sawyer
Company: Rebellion Photonics, Houston, TX
When Allison Lami Sawyer met co-founder Robert Kester, they were working on a chemical imaging camera that attached to microscopes to aid biological research.
Over their first meeting at the Rice University student bar, Sawyer (who'd read Kester's technical paper twice) proposed a minor detour: Taking the camera to the oil and gas industry for real-time leak detection.
“What I was pitching was that we utterly change one of the largest industries in the world,” they say. “I was 25 and they were 28, and we were broke. But we weren't afraid for one second.”
They and Kester started entering business plan competitions and applying for grants. By the end of 2010, they were already selling their first product, the Arrow, to research labs. And over the next two years—with $1.5 million in government contracts, $700,000 in product sales, and some debt—Rebellion Photonics started building their Gas Cloud Imaging (GCI) camera. Three years later, they have their first GCI customer, BP. Installation one is going up this month. And projected revenue for 2012 is $2 million.
Sawyer's secret weapon? Focus. “From the very first day Robby and I were in that bar, we outlined where we wanted to go. If something doesn't directly help us get there, then we can't do it. I'd love to hang out at parties, but instead I go to the oil and gas conferences.”

If you looked out at Lake Ontario Saturday morning and saw rescue boats carrying dozens of injured passengers back from the Toronto Islands, don't be alarmed. There was no massive shipwreck. It wasn't an April Fool's prank either.

The “rescue” mission was the annual training simulation of HMCS York, a Toronto-based reserve unit of the Royal Canadian Navy. It was a chance for the crew of about 140 members to test how they'd react in a real emergency. The scenario: a cruise ship had capsized off the Toronto shore. Passengers had managed to swim to the nearby island beach, some with severe injuries.

“In an emergency, it's all hands on deck,” said Commander Robert Johnston, captain of HMCS York. “That's the way the navy works. You can be asked to anything or ordered to do whatever it takes to prosecute a mission.” The exercise also involved about 40 members of the Toronto Police Marine Unit, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, Toronto Fire Services, St-John Ambulance and other city emergency staff.

Small rescue mission vessels, each up to seven metres in length and fitting about eight people or fewer, rush out to the island. On the beach, crews find dozens of people lying in need of urgent medical assistance. The “civilian casualties” are actually volunteers, acting out various scenarios they've been assigned — complete with wounds painted on their bodies with makeup – that are previously unknown to the responders. One man has a large gash on their neck. Another victim has a stick lodged in a lung. Some are suffering from hypothermia or head injuries, while one man, pretending to be a woman, is feeling especially unwell because he's pregnant.

Back at headquarters, a command centre is coordinating every step of the operation with those on the water and the beach. “There's a huge amount of background planning that goes into something like this,” said Johnston. “There's a whole command and control layer which is very important because you can't just go off in your boats and we'll see you when you get back.”

Responders' first job is identifying those most immediately in need of medical assistance. Injuries are colour-coded with the use of red, yellow and green duct tape around patients' arms.

Red indicates the patient has less than an hour to live. Green means the injury is minor, which can likely wait. Yellow means the victim's life could be in danger, but they should live for at least an hour. “When we first get here, we analyze the situation,” said Aaron Vijayan, a 23-year-old maritime surface and sub-surface officer with HMCS York. “Everyone here has a different role and responsibility.” “When we come here, we look at who can we help first and who would be the most important to take back,” they said. “We're landing on the beach, tagging our high-priority casualties and then taking them as we go and helping them once we get to HMCS York on the other side. We do first aid on them and then St-John Ambulance will take them to hospital as needed.” On this day, the exercise is going in “slow time.” The emphasis is on doing it properly, not fast.

While the unit is practicing all morning and into the afternoon, responding to a real-life emergency of the same magnitude would likely need to be done in about half an hour, according to Johnston. “We're walking through the process. It wouldn't take this long in a real life scenario but you have to start by taking it a step at a time,” they said. “That's what builds people's knowledge and skill and confidence so that they're ready to go like that.” Along the way, unexpected issues are thrown at the team: broken boats, a call about more casualties elsewhere and even an injured person who can't stop screaming for help because their iPhone broke in the water during the swim to shore. “Every time you do one of these exercises, you plan, you plan and you plan but there's always stuff that gets you that you don't know about,” said Vijayan. In past training exercises, the unit has had to respond to similar Toronto-specific scenarios, such as a plane headed to Billy Bishop Airport going down in the water. “We train with the surroundings we're in,” said Vijayan. “So being here in Toronto, the likeliness of a cruise ship going down is possible. You like to be ready.”
The rolling hills to the east of Paris are known for their cash crops. Large quantities of vegetables and grain, champagne and brie have been produced here for centuries.
But as the world's thirst for petroleum sends industry searching for oil in increasingly unlikely locations, this bucolic region could soon become the stage for a fight that pits potentially huge economic benefits against fears of environmental destruction.
Oil industry estimates claim that there are between 50 billion and 200 billion barrels of oil trapped in shale rock more than a mile below the surface, in an 87,000-square-mile geological formation known as the Paris Basin. Now, in a first for Europe, oil companies are bringing technology from the United States, which fueled the natural-gas boom in the US over the past decade, to try to extract it.
If the projects succeed, they could move France one step closer to energy self-sufficiency – the country is also among the most aggressive developers of nuclear energy – and bring billions of dollars in profits for oil companies, thousands of jobs, and increased tax revenues for the French government.
But environmentalists worry they could also transform a largely agricultural region into vast fields of oil derricks that suck up billions of gallons of water normally used for irrigation and by individuals.
The region has produced small amounts of oil since the late 1950s. Production peaked in 1988, but dropped to its current level of about 10,000 barrels a day as oil prices declined. Interest picked up again about two years ago as oil companies adapted new technology, known as horizontal fracturing or hydraulic fracking, which was originally developed to extract gas from shale rock in the US.
How 'fracturing' works
Shale is as dense as hardened clay, and oil does not flow from it easily. Horizontal fracturing breaks up the rock by blasting water under high pressure into horizontally drilled wells, so the oil can be extracted.
The technique is widely used in the US to produce natural gas from shale. The first success with shale oil was in the Bakken formation in the Williston Basin, stretching across North Dakota into southern Saskatchewan. Companies there have used the technique to ramp up oil production from 80 thousand barrels a day in 2004 to 300 thousand barrels a day this year. The rock formations in the Paris Basin have a similar structure and history, so oil companies hope the technology will work in France, as well. Ten companies are competing for permits that would give them the right to explore and eventually develop the fields, in what is the toughest competition for resources France has seen in decades.
"We are seeing an incredible amount of interest. Trying to sort out all the permits is like dealing with kids in the schoolyard," says Charles Lamiraux, head of oil exploration for the French energy ministry. "I think if they are fighting this hard it's because they think there is an important future there."
Vermilion Energy, already the biggest producer of oil from conventional fields in France, was the first to tap into the shale rock. Earlier this year, it used two conventional vertical wells in a farmer's field to conduct tests on the shale layer. Vermilion's vice president of European operations, Peter Sider, says the results were "encouraging."
"We now know we can produce oil from the shales because we are doing it every day," they say.
First, five years of exploration
Mr. Sider says Vermilion plans to spend $160 million on research and development over the next five years. Another company, Toreador Resources, plans to invest up to $120 million next year to drill six wells and assess their potential.
The projects are in their infancy, and Craig McKenzie, president and chief executive officer of Toreador, says their company expects to spend up to five years exploring the area and figuring out if the technology that has worked in the US will succeed in France. They say they can't say how much oil might be recovered from the Paris region because even identical rocks in similar formations do not always react in the same way. The Institut Français du Petrol estimates that 5 to 10 percent at most may be recovered. Vermilion and Toreador say it could be just a half to 1 percent.
Mr. Lamiraux, the energy ministry official, says that in the most optimistic case, France would go from producing just 1 percent of its petroleum needs to 5 percent.
"That would be very important for us. It would be oil that is made in France, that we don't have to buy from a developing country and it would improve our trade balance. And the fact it doesn't have to be transported from a long distance would also benefit the environment," they say.
Revenue, but environmental costs?
Tax revenues for municipalities and the French government, as well as income generated from oil industry-related services would "at least double," Lamiraux added. But they say possible environmental damage to some of France's richest agricultural land is also an "essential concern."
Horizontal fracturing involves pumping large amounts of water into the ground at high pressure to break up shale and release oil. On average, each well uses as much water as 100,000 people in France use in a day. The process requires from 10 to 20 times as many wells to extract the same amount of oil as from a conventionally drilled well. Often, the wells are closely spaced – as little as 300 feet apart.
Mr. McKenzie says most of the water could be reused for subsequent wells and that oil companies are working to limit the effect on the environment.
But Marie-Paul Duflot, president of one of the largest environmental groups in the Seine and Marne region, which covers the Paris Basin, says they are concerned large-scale shale oil development in the area would "transform our countryside into a field of derricks. We don't want that."
Ms. Duflot, who says they were shocked to learn that oil companies have such ambitious plans for the region, says they are also worried about possible pollution and water shortages.
Lamiraux says environmental concerns may mean that shale oil development proceeds at a slower pace than it has in North America and may even reduce the amount of oil that can be extracted. But as long as oil prices continue to rise, companies say they expect the project to pay off.
"This is a big pie," says Paul Beique, Vermilion's vice president of capital markets. "If the pie is big enough, even one piece is OK."
Story highlights The robberies occurred in three states in less than a month
In each case, employees said the robber was a woman; tactics were similar
(CNN) The approaches are strikingly similar: Robber enters a jewelry store, whips out a gun and forces employees into the back before taking off with merchandise.
In each of three recent robberies, the thief was described as a woman who allegedly tied up store employees before loading up on valuables. The robberies occurred in three states, at three different franchises, between early August and early September.
Authorities in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida are investigating whether there are connections between the three.
Georgia: They had 'masculine build'
The first robbery, on August 5, targeted a Zales store Dawsonville, Georgia, about 60 miles north of Atlanta.

A long-legged white crane flits languidly through a paddy field as birdsong fills the air among the lush green hills. Welcome to possibly the most dangerous nature haven on the planet – the demilitarised zone separating South and North Korea.
But the biggest dangers are not the tigers reputed to roam there, or even the bears and leopards, but the millions of land mines and tank traps. In addition to the weaponry, North Korea's 1 million-man army faces the south's 600,000 troops, backed by 28,000 US ground troops, each side glaring theatrically at each other across the military demarcation line in Panmunjom at the 38th parallel.
Nonetheless, whilst political stability holds, foreign tourists – not Koreans - are being allowed to visit a small safe part of the zone, in Panmunjon, on bus trips from Seoul (there are no plans to clear the area of mines but estimates run to $1bn to do the job). The atmosphere is more Disneyland with a military twist than a potential flashpoint for a third world war, a mood reinforced by sales of rusty barbed wire in the tourist shop.
Environmentally, the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is unique. Nowhere else in the world has a patch of land that was worked by farmers for over 5,000 years suddenly been allowed to revert to a true state of nature. Ever since the 1953 armistice was signed - although not by the two Koreas - the strip of land, 2.4 miles wide and 155 miles long, has developed into a de facto nature reserve, untouched by human activity.
For the past five decades, the battlefields of the DMZ, on which 4 million were killed or wounded, have returned to thick prairie and shrub in the west and rich green forests in the eastern mountain ranges.
Endangered plants and animals have thrived. The Asiatic black bear, leopard, Eurasian lynx, and Goral sheep have made a comeback, and perhaps even the very rare Amur tiger - which some US soldiers say has been captured on video by surveillance teams. Many migratory birds, including the white-naped and red-crowned cranes and the black-faced spoonbill have made their homes in the DMZ. Environmentalists say over 1,100 plant species and mammal species exist in this wildlife sanctuary.
But environmentalists worry over how long the DMZ will remain in its pristine state. Development is creeping right up to the barbed wire in the south, now the world's 13th largest economy. Deforestation has caused severe flooding to the north of the DMZ.
The Gaeseong industrial park, which opened in 2004, could be a sign of things to come. Visible in the distance from Panmunjom, the industrial zone combines cheap North Korean labour with South Korean investment as part of Seoul's attempt to woo Pyongyang out of its isolation. Six miles north of the DMZ, Gaeseong has direct road and rail access to South Korea and is just one hour's drive from Seoul. Should Korea ever become united – and remember the speed at which Germany united - the pressure to develop the DMZ could be irresistible, calling time on this wilderness.
Mindful of this risk, Ke Chung Kim, 74, founded the DMZ Forum in 1994 in what must be one of the world's most ambitious swords into ploughshare projects - preserving the DMZ as a nature reserve under the auspices of a Unesco world heritage site. Kim has won the backing of Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan and others, and annual conferences have been held since 2003.
A professor of entomology, Kim is curator and director at the centre for biodiversity research at Pennsylvania state university. They will attend a wetlands conference in Seoul in October when they will again lobby the South Korean government to try and persuade Pyongyang to come to an agreement on preserving the DMZ as a nature reserve.
"I feel we're at a make or break point," they told the Guardian, as the developers get ever nearer to the DMZ.
But if Kim is having trouble getting their idea on the national political agenda in the south, the challenges are even more forbidding with the north. "North Korean scientists and intellectuals see the value of a nature reserve, but as long as the military control the government, it won't be top of their agenda," Kim lamented.
Kim's job is all the tougher than relations between the two Koreas have been frozen since the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, reacted badly to the more robust approach to diplomacy adopted by the South Korea's new president, Lee Myung-bak, who came into office in February.
However, there is support for Kim from local officials. Kim Moon-soo, the governor of Geyonggi-do, one of the two provinces in South Korea abutting the DMZ, has raised the intriguing idea of a north-south bike path as well as a small eco-park.
"They would be confidence-building measures, if you like, to try and regain some momentum after the recent deterioration in relations," said T H Lee, spokesperson for governor Kim.
Lee, who spent one night in the DMZ in the 1980s as part of their military service training, is bullish about plans to turn the DMZ into a nature reserve: "The DMZ was once a symbol of conflict, it should now be turned into a symbol of peace."
Lee, who is also a successful investor, takes a hard line against any sort of development within the DMZ, including hotels, no matter how tempting the opportunity for a unique resort. They insisted that there was no need for accommodation that would despoil the area's natural beauty. "You can stay in Seoul, the one-hour drive is part of the experience."
Lee is right because the sights and memorials on the way – including one to the 18 killed war correspondents – is part of the build-up to the DMZ. Apart from being a de-facto nature reserve, the DMZ is considered sacred ground, with the remains of tens of thousands of casualties of war still undiscovered.
The challenges of preserving the DMZ as a unique nature reserve are formidable, starting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. It is likely their priority would be rapid development as a means of bringing in badly-needed foreign exchange. Moreover, the DMZ's future lies not just with the north and south, but with the US, China and Russia, the signatories to the 1953 armistice.
Yet notwithstanding all the obstacles, Professor Kim clings steadfastly to their vision of the DMZ.
"Without biodiversity, Korea's future will be short-changed so we are determined to protect the DMZ and preserve it permanently," they said. "Many of the species that disappeared from the rest of Korea are still there. There is a lot at stake here."

Yes, that's the recently-signed P.J. Dozier. And what's so crazy about wearing 35?
Oh, right. But the reason behind the jersey choice goes deeper than simply taking Kevin Durant's old number:

“My second cousin was Reggie Lewis, used to play for the Boston Celtics. That all it is. It wasn't anything other than that … I honestly didn't think twice about it.”
That would be a reference to the late Reggie Lewis, who died suddenly in 1993 at age 27, after a promising start to a career that included a spot on the East's All-Star roster in 1991-92.
So it's a tribute, not a troll job.
Debate moderators are confused about their jobs, and spend too much time interrupting and weighing in. Let's just get rid of them.
Seth MacFarlane had a good idea this week:
Here's an idea: Lose the damn studio audience at the debates. No one cares about hearing their circus noises. Treat it like Kennedy/Nixon.
Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) September 21, 2016
I kind of like rowdy debate crowds. There were a couple of debates during the Republican primary where the crowd seemed half-drunk. That's how politics should be done. Still, they can be distracting. Yet if they throw in the so-called moderators out as well, he's got a deal!
In mediated political debates, journalists are supposed to moderate and control what topics are covered, how questions are framed, and what assumptions are built into topics. Some do it better than others, of course, but too often the moderators — from smug local journalists to Candy Crowley — become part of the story.
They rarely have the chops to ask good policy questions or follow up on dumb policy answers. With politicians they support, they won't push back much on even the most erroneous or outlandish claims. But if they don't like a candidate, they'll push back, no matter how uninformed about the matter at hand they may be. This is related to another point of confusion: they seem to believe it's their job to argue with candidates rather than facilitate discussions among candidates.
Many of these moderators ask questions full of incorrect assumptions, mistaking their job of reporting on a given topic for being significantly knowledgeable on the same. The ideological agendas various journalists advance show that the media are not neutral parties.
To take just one example, reporters love to push pro-life candidates about every angle of their views on the sanctity of life, posing increasingly difficult questions. But when was the last time you heard a pro-choice politician asked much of anything about their views, much less if they think the right to abortion extends to killing a child because she's a girl?
The Feigned Matt Lauer Outrage
Remember all the way back to earlier this month, when Matt Lauer did a better-than-adequate job moderating a candidate forum. Hillary Clinton had a rough night while Donald Trump did fine. Them supporters in the media launched an all-out attack on Lauer. “Matt Lauer's Pathetic Interview of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Is the Scariest Thing I've Seen in This Campaign,” read the headline of one typical and totally not hyperbolic piece arguing that Lauer went easy on Trump and hard on Clinton. I'm not sure anyone viewed this as much more than an attempt to send a warning shot to future moderators that they had better do more to help Clinton and hurt Trump.
Or as David Burge put it:
.@mtracey I expect campaigns to "work the refs." What's weird is watching the refs work the refs.
David Burge (@iowahawkblog) September 9, 2016
For what it's worth, Tim Carney points out that the media have been far too compliant with the Clinton campaign's attempts to work them.
Many in media have not had a banner couple of weeks since the Lauer forum. To take the example of just one newspaper, the Washington Post editorial page called for less scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's email scandal, and one of their political reporters demanded that mainstream journalists not pay any attention to Clinton's alleged health problems. Them physical collapse at a 9/11 memorial event — the campaign claimed they were unable to control their body because of dehydration and pneumonia — occurred just days later.
The Call For ‘Fact' ‘Checking'
Some reporters and media critics thought they figured out a magic bullet to stop Trump and help Clinton. What if the moderators would take on more of a “fact” “checking” role?
What are the moderators in the debates gonna do when Trump says they opposed the Iraq War & Hillary says no you didnt?
Reid J. Epstein (@reidepstein) September 19, 2016
The New York Times called for moderators to be more hostile to Trump.
Margaret Sullivan at the Washington Post came up with a list of five things that debate moderators must do, including:
2. Be well-prepared enough to assert the truth in real time. Wallace, who'll moderate the last debate — just two weeks before the election — has already said that they don't see their role as fact-checking, otherwise known as calling the candidates on their lies.
“I'm not there to truth-squad,” they told their colleague Howard Kurtz. That was surprising because Wallace can be a very tough and effective interviewer; I hope he'll change their mind about that. If journalists aren't interested in being part of the truth squad, they should find another sport.
They can get some help with this, through some real-time fact-checking by the networks airing the debates. We've seen some from cable networks during the campaign in those bottom-of-the-screen captions known as chyrons. (“He's not,” said one of them when Trump insisted President Obama was the founder of ISIS.) More of this, please!
She's not joking. They meant that. And what a particularly bad example to choose. “Fact” “checking” one candidate's rhetorical flourishes with an autistic literalism is just about the worst thing the media could do.
Recall Crowley's epic misfire during a debate in 2012 when they “fact” “checked” an issue in real time in a manner that greatly helped President Obama out of a jam only to realize later that she'd messed up. The issue related to whether the Obama administration had admitted that the Benghazi attack was terrorism or whether they had claimed it was a spontaneous protest in response to an American-made video critical of Islam. It took the Obama administration a week and a half to even begin to admit publicly what they knew right away — that it was a coordinated terror attack.
They did this after sending out State Department employees to insist that all the best evidence was that this was just a run-of-the-mill protest that got carried away. Romney was critical of this dance. Crowley weighed in to give the impression that President Obama had come clean about the terrorism right away, using the loophole that he'd made a vague reference to terror during an announcement the day after Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans had been killed.
This is why you don't “fact” “check” in real time, whether to pretend that you don't understand what Trump's point about Obama being the founder of ISIS is or whether you're just kind of confused about the timeline of shenanigans post-Benghazi.
Here's a Better Plan: No Moderators
Of the moderators chosen for upcoming debates, some are fine and some are Martha Raddatz, arguably the worst debate moderator of the previous cycle. CNN's Anderson Cooper proved adept at moderating Democratic debates — perhaps the best moderator of any of this cycle's primary debates — but their hostility to those they disagree with could very well pose a serious problem.
Everyone's nervously continuing to work the moderators. Hollywood Reporter just ran a piece headlined: “Don't Get Lauer'd: Nervous Networks Prep for Presidential Debates.”
Just get rid of the moderators altogether! They're wildly confused about their role — see this Ron Fournier tweet for a particularly egregious, if funny, example:
2 Telling a journo to moderate debate but don't fact-check is like telling a boxer to climb in ring but don't fight https://t.co/O50yJ2Ll3V
Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) September 19, 2016
Fournier kept at it for several more tweets, insisting that journalists should be boxers in a ring against politicians. Try to imagine a group of people less qualified or less trusted to do that.
In general, American trust in mass media has sunk to a historic low, according to Gallup. Only 32 percent say they have “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of trust. For Republicans, the trust plummets even further to 14 percent, down precipitously from 32 percent the previous year. And check out these numbers:
Here are the favorable/unfavorable ratings in the new national NBC/WSJ poll pic.twitter.com/DuYoxV5rbi
Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) September 21, 2016
The only person or group listed in that poll who has lower favorability ratings than the media is Vladimir Putin. Americans despise the media more than Trump, more than Clinton, even more than Canada.
The media have absolutely shot their already-on-the-ropes credibility this cycle by removing any pretense of objectivity. In what world are these people “moderating” anything, much less an important debate? In what world should that happen?
Remember the examples cited above, where moderators were supposed to say Obama didn't literally start ISIS and that Trump gave a tepid “Yeah, I guess so” and a few other conflicted public remarks about the Iraq War? This would make more sense if it were a one-sided forum. But not for a debate.
In a debate, the opponent has the opportunity to call out whatever they or they want to. And a skilled debater can use such opportunities to their or their advantage. There is no need for one candidate to be in a ring fighting both another candidate and a referee raring to go. Donald Trump is a big boy. Hillary Clinton is a big girl. They can more than handle each other face to face without running to Lester Holt or Chris Wallace and asking for help.
If more than a few journalists showed an ability to be impartial or to moderate discussions, there would be use in having them on stage. As it is, the candidates should just agree to some basic rules about topics and time limits, and then go for it.
It would be entertaining, it would be instructive, and it would frankly add a level of difficulty to the pseudo-events we call debates.
If it was good enough for President Lincoln and their opponents, it should be good enough for us. Let's do this, for the good of the country.
Four police officers in Oakland, California, have been fired in a sex scandal involving a teenage prostitute who claimed to have been involved with multiple officers in departments across the Bay Area, officials announced Wednesday.
The year-long internal investigation concluded the four officers were involved in attempted sexual assault, engaging in lewd conduct in public, assisting in the crime of prostitution, accessing the department's criminal database for personal gain, and not reporting allegations of a minor having sexual contact with a police officer, Oakland City Administrator Sabrina Landreth told reporters.
The allegations stem from a sex scandal involving a teenage prostitute who was allegedly involved with more than 30 uniformed officers across seven law enforcement agencies in the area.
In exchange for sex, the woman has alleged, the officers offered their money and tips on when and where police would be conducting sex stings so they could avoid arrest.
The woman, who is now 19, has said some of those sexual encounters with police officers occurred when they were a minor.
"I want to send a clear message to the victims of sexual abuse and sex exploitation: We see you, we hear you, and we are here to help you," Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said during a news conference. "And to those who exploit these victims and profit or take pleasure in their pain: We see you, too."
The allegations have sparked internal investigations in police departments, sheriff offices, and district attorney offices across the Bay Area, as well as a criminal probe by prosecutors.
The allegations imploded after one of the officers allegedly sexually involved with the woman while they were a minor committed suicide and left behind a note naming other officers engaged in the conduct.
Shortly after the allegations were made public, Oakland police, the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department, and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office placed employees implicated in the scandal on administrative leave.
Facing increased scrutiny over the allegations, three Oakland police chiefs were fired or resigned within days.
On Wednesday, Landreth said a total of 12 officers have been recommended for disciplinary actions, including the four unidentified officers who were fired.
Seven officers were also recommended for suspensions, without pay, for failing to report violations of law, failing to report allegations of a police officer having sexual contact with a minor, accessing the department's criminal database for personal use, and bringing disrepute to the department.
History shows team rarely revamps a contract with three years remaining
PHOENIX — Seahawks defensive lineman Michael Bennett might not want to be traded out of Seattle, as a report last week suggested.
But Bennett does indeed want to renegotiate their contract with the Seahawks, according to a source, who said Bennett's representatives already have “approached'' the team about redoing their deal.
Bennett, who is represented by Drew Rosenhaus, signed a four-year, $28.5 million contract in March 2014.
Seattle general manager John Schneider said Monday that Bennett has not asked to be traded — one report said last week they want to be dealt to Atlanta.
But asked if Bennett has asked the team to trade them or redo their contract, Schneider simply said “he's never asked to be traded.''
Schneider left unanswered whether Bennett has asked to have their contract renegotiated.
Asked about the tweet from a reporter from the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram of Bennett wanting to be traded, Schneider said, “It's my understanding that Michael is very happy in Seattle and loves playing there, so that's really about all I can say about it. I'm not exactly sure where all that came from.''
Bennett has not spoken publicly since the report last week.
If the team's precedent in dealing with renegotiations means anything, then Bennett is unlikely to get a new contract from the Seahawks.
The Seahawks previously have only renegotiated deals they have signed with their players once they are entering the final year of the contract.
That was at the heart of Marshawn Lynch's holdout before training camp last season as they had two years remaining on their contract at the time. The team ultimately reworked their contract to guarantee an additional $1.5 million for 2014 but without adding any new money.
The team recently redid Lynch's deal once the 2014 season was completed and they had just one year remaining, signing them to a new contract worth $12 million annually.
Schneider told 710 ESPN Seattle earlier this year that the team waited until after the 2014 season to do a deal with Lynch due to not wanting to set a precedent of redoing contracts with more than a year remaining.
If they did, they said, then “everybody would be standing outside my office looking for a new contract whenever they wanted. ‘'
According to Overthecap,com, Bennett is the 14th-highest paid 4-3 defensive end in terms of annual salary at $7.125 million, tied with teammate Cliff Avril.
After signing their new contract last March, Bennett responded with a standout season, making 39 tackles and seven sacks while playing 84.7 percent of the defensive snaps, up from 57 percent in 2013, and being named an alternate to the Pro Bowl.
Asked late in the season about playing more snaps, Bennett said: “When they pay you a lot of money, they want you on the field all the time. That's just how it is.''
Exit poll
“The exit poll is predicting the Conservatives will be the largest party …” So far, so expected. “But no overall majority.” Jaws hit the floor across the land. A hung parliament? Really? Is it possible? We're now familiar with surprising exit polls, but one that favours the progressives? Surely not. Anyone who'd planned to stay up for the early prediction before going to bed safe in the knowledge that the Tories would be returned with a horrifying majority was suddenly on the edge of their seats, waiting for hints from Newcastle and Sunderland for the veracity of John Curtice's exit poll. It was going to be a long, long night.

Election results live: senior Tories round on May's 'dreadful' campaign after heavy loss Read more
Speculation was rife that the most unpleasant of MPs had unexpectedly had their 10,000 majority overturned. A man who filibustered attempts to pass legislation to help end violence against women, a man who spoke for over an hour to prevent Caroline Lucas's attempt to bring in compulsory sex and relationship education, the meninist representative for Shipley was no more. The Women's Equality party brought the campaign against them to mass public attention and ran a hugely professional ground campaign encouraging residents to vote against the incumbent. But there was a sting in the tail. Some two hours later, the official result came out. Davies held on relatively comfortably, WEP had lost its deposit, and Shipley had let the nation down.
The SNP tide recedes
As Angus Robertson – the SNP's leader in Westminster – was toppled by a Tory. The irony that Scotland could save the Conservatives bacon wasn't lost on anyone. The high of 2015 seemed a long way away as Alex Salmond and a host of SNP members lost their seats. It seems a repudiation of Nicola Sturgeon's push for a second referendum – yet another vote the public don't want – and another signal that Britain has returned to the warm embrace of two party politics.
Nigel Farage declares their intention to return to frontline politics
Farage hopped from studio to studio, hailing Jeremy Corbyn's campaigning, saying Theresa May was toast, and generally looking like a grey frog. But it was their threat/promise to begrudgingly return to frontline politics which should really worry us. Farage warned a second referendum could be on the cards, and promised to rejoin the fray to ensure there is no backtrack on Brexit. Another reason to bemoan May for this pointless election.

They may have held their own seat, but no doubt May had a catastrophic night. Stood just along from fellow candidates Lord Buckethead, Howling “Laud” Hope (Monster Raving Loony party) and someone dressed as Elmo from Sesame Street, the tremble in their voice gave away that the game was up. A period of stability was expected. The Tories would do their duty to provide it. But this ignored the fact that they were the person who wrought any instability less than two weeks out from the start of Brexit negotiations. The prime minister looks unstable just as their enemies in the party sharpen their knives.

Return of the Zac
After what seemed like an interminable number of recounts, Zac Goldsmith has returned to being MP for the Conservatives. Having lost a bid to become London mayor, when they ran a campaign that was described as “racist” they resigned as an MP over the explansion of Heathrow, only to lose their seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney.
He's now ousted her, but with a slim, slim majority of 45. Expect tactical voting to get rid of them next time there's an election. Which may be rather sooner than we expected.
Close run thing in Fife
The closest race of the night to be declared was without doubt in North East Fife, where the SNP's Stephen Gethins held out against Liberal Democrat Elizabeth Riches by just two votes. It's the smallest majority an MP has had since 1997, when Mark Oaten also won Winchester for the Liberal Democrats by two votes.
Just one changed mind would have led to a dead heat, unprecedented in modern times in a parliamentary election. The procedure then is, sadly, not a penalty shoot-out, but the candidates either draw straws or cut cards to see who gets to represent the constituency. This actually happened in the local elections a few weeks back.
Lots of people claimed that youth turnout was at 72%
People are sharing a figure saying that youth turnout was at 72%, which would be remarkable, and really be one-in-the-eye for media commentators who have spent weeks saying that young people are lazy and don't vote. Except, nobody seems to be able to source the figures. The earliest tweets mentioning the number come from someone organising a youth vote campaign – but we're not aware of anybody collecting that demographic data.
Polling companies have started yet another inquest
Going into Thursday's vote, Survation was the only polling company whose numbers were close to the eventual vote split between Conservatives and Labour. They gave the Tories a one point lead. At the other end of the spectrum, ICM had May ahead by 12 points. It's going to be another long night of the soul for the heads of polling companies, who will now have struggled to predict the outcomes of the 2015 general election, EU referendum, US presidential election and now this.
Interestingly enough, one company emerged with a poll saying Labour had just nudged ahead – but most commentators dismissed that.
Theresa May has indicated they have no intention of resigning.
But then again, they said they aren't going to call an election, either.

George H.W. Bush to vote for Hillary Clinton
EDITOR'S NOTE: Why do we call them the Bush Crime Family? Well, forget for just a moment that Prescott Bush helped to finance the Nazi war machine during WWII, or that their son George H.W. Bush declared they would help to usher in a New World Order. Also forget that a Bush family member was in charge of security for the World Trade Center on 9/11, or that when George W. Bush was informed the first tower was hit, they continued to calmly read a book to school children for another 29 minutes. Today it was announced that NWO elite George H.W. Bush will be voting for NWO elite Hillary Clinton. Any questions?
Former President George H.W. Bush is bucking their party's presidential nominee and plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to a member of another famous political family, the Kennedys.
George H.W. Bush Says He's Voting for Hillary Clinton:
Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of their distaste for the GOP nominee. But their preference for the wife of their own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy.
On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on their Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: “The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!”
In a telephone interview, Townsend said they met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where they said they made their preference known that they were voting for a Democrat. “That's what they said,” they told POLITICO.
George Bush declares the coming New World Order:
I think it would interest you to know that Bush gave their infamous New World Order speech on September 11, 1991…
Asked about Townsend's post, George H.W. Bush spokesperson Jim McGrath in an email replied, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days.  They are not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.”
The Oligarchical Bush Family of Generational Treason:
George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush have stayed out of the political debate since campaigning earlier this year for their son Jeb's unsuccessful bid for president. Neither George H.W. Bush nor their son, former President George W. Bush, attended this summer's Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Trump accepted the nomination.
Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.
Troy Bodie didn't have to look at their stats to know they had a good night. That was obvious when Tim Leiweke came into the locker-room to congratulate him.

“He doesn't come in here often,” they said of Leiweke, who is the president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment and Bodie's father-in-law. “So when they do, you take it.” That two-assist performance against the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday was something of a culmination of efforts for Bodie, who was playing in their 16th straight game for the Maple Leafs after spending almost a month in the minors. The right-winger, who is married to Leiweke's daughter Francesa, played over 15 minutes because they were replacing the injured David Clarkson on Toronto's third line, and they made the most of that chance.

“He's very noticeable,” coach Randy Carlyle said. “He's been strong on the forecheck, he's a big strong hockey player. That's the way they are.” Bodie's signing over the summer wasn't heralded as a franchise-altering move and for good reason. The 29-year-old had just six goals and five assists in 107 NHL games for the Anaheim Ducks and Carolina Hurricanes. Even now, Bodie isn't a star for the Leafs, but amid injuries and plenty of lineup fluctuations, they just need them to be a consistent contributor and they have shown a recent ability to do that. “Sometimes the game's all about opportunity, whether they're throwing you in there because you're playing well or not or what,” Bodie said. “But you just get the opportunities, you try to do something with it.” Bodie's two assists against Philadelphia were well-deserved because they essentially created those goals, first by driving the net before Jake Gardiner scored and later by making a pass and then tapping goaltender Steve Mason's pads enough that the puck went over the line after Mason Raymond's shot.
But their contributions playing between the third and fourth lines went beyond just those goals. Bodie helped create scoring chances and sustained offensive-zone time whether they were playing with Raymond and Peter Holland or Jay McClement and Frazer McLaren. “It's nice to do something with the opportunity given,” Bodie said. “The guys I play with, with Mason and Peter and J-Mac at the end there, we're all hard-working guys. It's nice to get guys like that who do the same things you do — we just get in on the forecheck and just muck around and just let the chips fall where they may.”

If Clarkson (pulled muscle in leg) misses any time on the Leafs road trip, which starts Monday night against the Anaheim Ducks, Bodie could continue to see a heavier-than-normal workload. If not, a spot on the fourth line seems to suit them just fine. Ideally, Bodie would like to make a real impact against one of their former teams because this is something of a homecoming. They had just five goals and three assists in 57 games with the Ducks. “Going back to California and Anaheim, it'd be nice to get in there and do something,” they said. “Shake it up a little bit.”

Hillary Clinton probably wishes they hadn't brought up Abraham Lincoln as an example of having a “public” and a “private” position on issues.
Speaking to the National Multi-Housing Council in April 2013, Clinton described their interpretation of how Lincoln got the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery passed.
“I mean, politics is like sausage being made,” Clinton said. “It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.”
When asked about this during Sunday night's debate (note, the moderators spared them the whole quote), Hillary again channeled Lincoln as a great example of why having two positions is OK.
Except, Donald Trump, finally hitting their stride at this point, was ready with the perfect rejoinder:
“Honest Abe never lied. That's the difference between Abraham Lincoln and you,” Trump told Clinton.
Donald Trump's social media manager was quick to post to Twitter even during the debate, and the reaction was swift:

How did George Lucas create Star Wars?
A critic might say "Oh, Lucas combined Flash Gordon with Akira Kurosawa, threw in some science fiction novels, comic books, The Wizard of Oz, and sewed it all up with Joseph Campbell's ideas on the structure of myth." And Lucas did do all those things, but that can't be the final answer. Why? Every storyteller would like to connect with people as deeply as Lucas did with Star Wars, and everyone has access to the same raw materials. If the process was really so obvious and simple, wouldn't every story be just as good?
For those of us trying to write a story we like as much as Star Wars, how do we even begin? Perhaps the answer lies in Basho's suggestion: "Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought." Maybe the key to becoming a skillful storyteller isn't imitation of the storytellers who have influenced us most, but figuring out what they were trying to achieve, then reaching for the same goal ourselves.
This website is filled with educated guesses as to what might have influenced George Lucas when they created the original Star Wars trilogy. The question is never where Lucas found their inspirations, but rather how they wove them together with such intelligence, insight and compassion. What gives a story the power to touch us? How does the imagination work?

Last week, after getting stuck in that mega-morass of an intersection, Watt and Fair Oaks, I asked readers what intersections got on their nerves, and whether any were worse.
Plenty, it turns out.
Lynn Wilcox is one of several who says Sunrise Boulevard at the Highway 50 offramps is worse than Watt and Fair Oaks: “Traffic backs up out onto the freeway during rush hours, and Sunrise is stuffed with bumper-to-bumper cars from many blocks south of Folsom Boulevard to the American River,” Wilcox said.
Notably, Sunrise and Watt are among the few streets that cross the river. Several readers pointed out that there once were plans – we're talking 1970s, 1980s and briefly in the 2000s – to build another river bridge. One route would have involved a connector from Highway 50 to the east end of Arden Way.
Sign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to The Sacramento Bee
That would take some pressure off Howe, Watt, Sunrise and Hazel. Residents in affected neighborhoods, river parkway advocates, environmentalists and some urban planners oppose that idea. That group includes a reader who complained about traffic jams at the Fair Oaks and Arden Way intersection but said they would not want to see a mega-boulevard bulldozed through there, turning that quiet end of Arden into another Watt or Sunrise.
What constitutes an aggravating intersection? From what readers say, it sounds like it's when you see the light ahead turn green, but you only can inch forward slowly, silently (or not so silently) urging the cars ahead of you to get going … get going, and then before you get to the intersection, the light turns red and you wait another several minutes.
Driver Jonathan Ball hinted they do something I think many drivers do at a certain point on their daily drive. They count the cars ahead of him. They know 15 can make it through the next light.
It seems a lot of the worst intersections involve streets that are called “avenues.” Isn't an avenue supposed to be a broad, tree-lined, laid-back street for strolling on?
Reader Becky Price says that's not the case at Madison Avenue and Dewey Drive. There's a lot of speeding on Dewey. They call it the “Dewey 500.”
Stuart Snider emailed us to warn about the congested intersections yet to come, the ones we don't see. They point to east Sacramento County and north Elk Grove, where large, spread-out developments are planned and where old ranch roads slowly are being widened.
But readers, in their comments, kept coming back to the Sunrise corridor near Highway 50. Kathleen Franklin drives on Coloma Road where it hits Sunrise. They describe the wait to make a left turn there in one word: “Endless.”
So, what to do? It's complicated. Widening streets doesn't really fix congestion in the long run when it just allows for new housing tracts to open up alongside, feeding new traffic.
Several readers say there are too many major corridors where the signal lights don't seem to be synchronized. Things like that often are harder to accomplish than it seems. But it's true that technology-based changes – like synchronized signals or signals that adapt to traffic flow changes – are a smart and less-expensive way to speed commutes.
Some drivers say they use the Waze smartphone app and Google real-time traffic maps to help them out, either timing their trips to avoid the worst delays or finding new routes around congested areas.
But that's been causing problems, too. Davis city officials recently told me traffic was jamming Second Street because Waze and Google were telling drivers to get off Interstate 80 during moments when freeway traffic was creeping and to cut through town instead to gain a few minutes.
Intersection congestion obviously is more than a traffic issue. It's also about where people can afford to live these days and how far away from work many have to live. The region desperately lacks reasonably priced housing for regular people near work centers, including downtown Sacramento. But that's a traffic jam of a different type.
WWE officials have informed us that Undertaker will be doing two shows next week on the European tour.
Undertaker is scheduled to appear on 4/19 in London, which are the Smackdown tapings, and will be doing a 4/20 house show in Newcastle.
Yesterday we had been told that they would be off the tour, but it was explained that there was a misunderstanding and they are off most of the tour, with Kane replacing them in all the other cities that they were originally advertised.
Undertaker was originally going to work the entire tour doing tag team matches in most cities. Last week they were pulled from advertising on most of the shows, but not all of them. As of yesterday, they were being advertised for three dates on the tour.
Originally, the European Tour was scheduled to be headlined by Undertaker on one side and Daniel Bryan appearances on the other, so had Undertaker pulled out of the entire tour they would have lost both of its headline acts.
The past, present, and future of Seattle's International District with Ron Chew – a lifelong Seattle resident with a long history of socially conscious journalism along with involvement in several labor and social justice organizations.
As is the case with many places around the world, Seattle has an area where residents with international backgrounds tend to cluster. The International District – often referred to as the ID is home to three neighborhoods: Chinatown, Japantown, and Little Saigon.
In addition to their career in journalism and activism, Ron Chew was the Executive Director of the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience. Currently, Ron runs Chew Communications, a community history and resource development consulting firm and is the Foundation Director for International Community Health Services. They describe themselves as an “oral historian” and a “storyteller.”
We dive into the ID and understand the conditions that led to its formation. Was it the result of an organic accumulation of population or was it forced into being by social and political actions? We discuss whether Seattle's robust growth will be a good force for the ID or will result in the dilution of a vibrant cultural scene.
You can't frame your future without somehow acknowledging and providing a place for the past to emerge. It provides an emotional connection to who you are.

“International District, Seattle” by Curtis Cronn
My politics were formed in the 1980s in the south Wales community where I grew up, and which I'm now proud to represent as its member of parliament. They are traditional British Labour politics: a belief in social solidarity and equality, in freedom and responsibility, in security and prosperity for all, and an undying faith in democracy and the Labour party as the only means to achieve any of it.
That faith was never blind, it comes from our history of delivering material social and economic progress for the people of our country, through winning the arguments and winning power. Our record of achievement, from the creation of the NHS and comprehensive education to the advent of a minimum wage, is why Labour can proudly claim to be the greatest movement for economic justice and social mobility that Britain has ever created. And it is precisely that history and its precious legacy that is at risk in this campaign.
Why Labour is putting energy reform at the heart of its green agenda | Jeremy Corbyn Read more
The greatest lesson that we can take from our history is that we can only implement our vision and apply our values when we win power and form a government. And today, with Jeremy Corbyn as our leader, even in the sixth year of a radical, rightwing and failing Tory government, the straight-talking truth is that we look further from power than we have done for generations.
The reason I am running in this campaign is that I am not prepared to sit by, as I was forced to in the 1980s and 90s, and see Labour's legacy dismantled by the Tories, as we turn inwards, away from unity, away from voters and away from any prospect of power. It's not just the Labour party that can't afford to make that mistake again, the people who need a Labour government now can't afford us to make that mistake.
They are not interested in some soap opera about the PLP or the leaders' office. They don't care about Momentum's Marxist critique of the crisis in capitalism, or talk of coups and deselection. What they want is a Labour party that looks like a credible alternative to the Tories. They want a progressive party of the left, with radical plans to even things up in our deeply unequal society, but one rooted in the everyday concerns of the British people. And the way we go about proving we're up to the task is by being good at our current job of opposition, and looking ready for the next job, as a government.
The victories I helped win – on tax credits and disabled people's benefits – are our most important ones in opposition
Now if I felt Corbyn was able to achieve either of those goals, I would still be serving in their shadow cabinet. But I do not, and that is why I am standing to replace him. Because I think the evidence of the last year is that Corbyn, for all their experience, is not suited to the task of opposing the Tories effectively in parliament, still less at building a united Labour team and a credible programme for government. And I believe that I am.
My evidence is the success I've had in my short time in parliament at opposing the Tories, on health and social security, on their assault on public services and working people. The victories I helped win – on tax credits and disabled people's benefits – are our most important ones in opposition. Just as important is my ability to build a Labour team of all our talents. Over 100 Labour MPs nominated me to lead our party, and I would be able to unite us in parliament, as Corbyn cannot.
Finally, there is the policy programme I have brought forward. It's a plan to turn our anti-austerity rhetoric into a radical but tangible plan for prosperity. A £200bn “new deal” to invest in the schools and skills, hospitals and housing stock that we need. A fair deal on taxation to rebuild an NHS that the Tories has brought to its knees. And a revolution in rights and rewards, increasing security, pay, terms and conditions for millions of British men and women.
But to deliver any of that, we have to win. And with just a few days to go in this contest and with thousands yet to vote, I am asking every Labour member, supporter and trade union affiliate to reflect on our history, to look to our future, and give me your vote and let me lead us back to power.

Abstract
Few events obtain the same instant worldwide news coverage as multiple victim public shootings. These crimes allow us to study the alternative methods used to kill a large number of people (e.g., shootings versus bombings), marginal deterrence and the severity of the crime, substitutability of penalties, private versus public methods of deterrence and incapacitation, and whether attacks produce copycats. Yet, economists have not studied this phenomenon. Our results are surprising and dramatic. While arrest or conviction rates and the death penalty reduce normal murder rates, our results find that the only policy factor to influence multiple victim public shootings is the passage of concealed handgun laws. We explain why public shootings are more sensitive than other violent crimes to concealed handguns, why the laws reduce both the number of shootings and their severity, and why other penalties like executions have differential deterrent effects depending upon the type of murder.

There is no doubt as to why this raccoon fell through the drop ceiling of this office. Look at the size of him! This big boy seems to be relaxing under the desk as they await their rescue. They were taken outside and released unharmed. pic.twitter.com/kXaizMt0Cw — Brad Gates (@GatesWildlife) November 23, 2017
Nov. 23 was not a typical workday at one Toronto-area office building. When employees showed up, there was a gaping hole in the ceiling above one desk. Underneath the desk, near the legs of a red chair, sat a masked intruder looking remarkably relaxed.
It was a raccoon, and it had crashed through the ceiling.
For Brad Gates and their team, the event was a typical workday. The wildlife control company he's run for three decades fields such a call — about a raccoon plummeting through a ceiling, stunning the people below — about every month, making this little fellow a usual suspect, if a bit heftier at 40 pounds. Also, Gates recalled, because it was morning, the nocturnal animal was “fast asleep under the desk.”
Such incidents occur year-round. But wildlife professionals say they are a bit more common in the cold of winter, when raccoons, which are adept at locating and squeezing through even small crevices in buildings and houses, cozy down in nooks of human shelters for longer stretches of time. Squirrels love attics, too, but when testing the load-bearing limits of ceilings, raccoons have a weight disadvantage. That is particularly true in commercial buildings, which often feature dropped ceilings meant to hide infrastructure, not serve as raccoon terrain.
“They may have been living in the building for a long period of time and may have found the one tile that wasn't set in as it should be,” Gates said. “And everything just comes tumbling down under the raccoon.”
Their surprise appearances happen often enough that the Internet features plenty of hilarious video of raccoons, legs splayed, suddenly dropping into human habitat, as well as tales of havoc wreaked during their attempts to escape. This year, falling raccoons seem to have favored Texas, plunging into the apartment of an Arlington woman who told a local television station that she'd heard the animals “have a party” in the ceiling; dropping into a San Antonio College building as a cleaner mopped nearby; and crashing into a corrections office in Angelina County.

Raccoons flourish in nearly every corner of the United States, and they are super smart, so you might say nowhere is safe from an intrusion. In December 2016, a raccoon breached the ceiling of a liquor store in Bristol, Tenn. In Facebook posts, storekeepers shared security camera video of the animal landing on all fours, collecting itself, then ransacking shelves as though hunting for the perfect vintage. At one point, it flips what the store manager reported was a $45.99 bottle of Baker's Bourbon onto the ground and “nails the landing.” The manager's post continued: “Warning there is evidence of alcohol abuse in this video…the raccoon broke a few bottles.”

Southern Canada also is home to the animals, and Toronto has been the site of several well-known raccoon capers. In May, for example, one peeked out of a ceiling hole above baggage claim at the city's airport; its masked face promptly went viral.
Raccoons frequently encroach on attics and ceilings, of course. But while invading protected and warm human space is certainly intentional, falling is not, said John Griffin, director of urban wildlife for the Humane Society of the United States. In houses, this usually happens when ceiling drywall has been weakened by moisture or mold — or raccoon urine and feces, if the critters have spent enough time above to have amassed a heavy latrine, as their toilet area is known.
“Believe me, when it happens, it is a surprise to everybody, including the raccoon,” said Griffin, whose role used to involve responding to wildlife conflict calls in the Washington area.
One time, Griffin said, the owner of a townhouse in the tony neighborhood of Georgetown returned from a three-day weekend away to find the home plundered. The drapes were torn. The dishes were broken. But the giveaways were a hole in the ceiling and what Griffin calls “the final insult”: a piece of raccoon scat near the bathroom sink, next to a tube of Colgate and a toothbrush.
“Eventually, the owner was able to laugh about it,” said Griffin, who pinpointed the animal's entry point as an opening near a satellite dish that had not been properly installed. By the time the owner came home, the raccoon had escaped through a dryer vent — showing, Griffin argued, “the perseverance, and the ability for the raccoon to contend with these kinds of human-built structures and all the things it has to do to stay alive in a city.”
It's not a good idea to have raccoons in the house, and not just for curtains. The animals can carry rabies and a very rare form of roundworm that can cause neurological damage, and even death, in people. Last week, a Philadelphia woman said their 4-month-old baby was brutally mauled by a raccoon that had gotten inside their apartment.
That's why keeping them out in the first place is crucial. At businesses, Gates said, the animals usually make their way through ventilation systems and rooftop air conditioners. At homes, roof vents, openings where two sections of roof meet and structural flaws are their typical front doors, they said.
When they capture a raccoon, Gates releases it nearby, because the animal will be familiar with local water resources, competitors and denning spots — the natural, outdoor kind. (Laws about trapping nuisance wildlife, as well as whether and where it can be released, vary from state to state.) Then Gates talks to the property owner about blocking holes in the building.
By this point, an owner “has been given signs that this is not a friendly tenant in the attic, and it can do damage,” Gates said. “It's easy to convince them that now is the time to seal the roof and make sure the animals can't get back inside.”
It is particularly easy in the extreme cases of falling raccoons. Gates recalled one client who was reading in bed when they reached over to pet what they thought was their cat. When it growled, they observed that it was a raccoon — and that there was a hole in their ceiling. They corralled it out the door.
But Gates's ultimate raccoon-crasher story occurred four or five years ago. The animal had made itself at home in an attic, and it had established its latrine right above the master bed. When it ambled over to do its business in the middle of one night, onto the sleeping homeowners crashed 30 pounds of raccoon waste, drywall and the furry critter itself.
“It was a rude awakening,” Gates said, but no one was injured. By the time they arrived, the raccoon was sleeping in a sink, as if he'd heard there was a guy who would come to escort them out.
“One thing about raccoons is they're so highly intelligent that they quickly can realize they're in a trapped environment and no effort is going to make a situation better,” Gates said. “So they conserve their energy.”

Last week, MIT announced an exciting, but somewhat obscure breakthrough—a new algorithm, called AMPS, that turns teams of robots into better learners. It lets autonomous systems quickly compare notes about what they've observed in their respective travels, and come up with a combined worldview.
If it seems like I've already succumbed to the worst temptations of robotics coverage—the urge to anthropomorphize machines, and to puree a discrete research achievement into a more easily digestible, broadly accessible slurry—bear with me. Though its authors aren't calling it a breakthrough, this algorithm appears to be just that.
AMPS, which is short for Approximate Merging of Posteriors for Symmetry (a reference to Bayesian statistical analysis), will be presented at the Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence in July. The algorithm tackles an extremely specific robotics problem. For a machine to operate in a given environment, it needs to assign semantic labels wherever possible. These are, in effect, cognitive shortcuts. So a rectangular section of the wall with hinges and a handle isn't always a puzzle, to be solved from scratch every time it's encountered. It's a door, which can be opened or closed. And sets of semantic labels can add up to bigger labels. A door (label) that opens up onto a room with a large central table (another label) and a bunch of chairs (more labels), might be a conference room.
This sort of rampant labeling is as important to autonomous bots as it is to humans. The difference, however, is that people are generally more limber with their label creation and recognition. “We as humans tend to have a fairly well-defined vocabulary for what things are,” says Jonathan How, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. “We know how to label things in a consistent global manner, or to pick them up by reading other things in our environment.” So if a person enters a conference room with no chairs in it, they or they don't suddenly feel adrift in time and space. We're smart like that.
Robots, comparatively speaking, can be rather dumb. Or rigid, at the very least. A chair-less conference room could be mistaken for a storage room, and forever labelled as such, long after the birthday party is over and the seats are returned. Far from anthropomorphizing them, this cognitive inflexibility is a reminder of just how inhuman robots are. And more problems can arise when machines try to share datasets, and combine their experiences into a larger collection of environmental labels. If one bot has registered an area as a conference room, and the other bot has labeled it as a storage room, how do they reconcile the discrepancy? Where humans could sort through the disagreement using our big mouths and still bigger brains, robots are stuck with their dueling, intransigent labels.
The AMPS algorithm promises to break these deadlocks, by allowing robots to reconsider the importance of various labels. “It's more than just where things are, it's what they are, what they're composed of,” says How. For example, how crucial is it for a conference room to have chairs? And if one robot has already spotted what it considers a storage room, complete with boxes, cabinets and shelves, would there really be another storage room so close to it (without any of those tell-tale features)? According to How, who created the algorithm with their graduate student, Trevor Campbell, the trick is to allow the interfacing machines to establish new priorities for their labels, rebuilding their worldview. By allowing for conference rooms that may or may not have chairs in them, and reordering their labels to account for different experiences, the robots can achieve what How and Campbell refer to as semantic symmetry.
This is a solution to a problem that, to be honest, isn't much of a problem yet. Autonomous systems are relatively rare outside of the well-defined, carefully labeled confines of manufacturing facilities, and ones that are designed to learn are rarer still. But as self-guided robots become more commonplace, and the environments and behaviors they have to navigate are more diverse, collaborative learning could be a serious asset. “It's about building robots that aren't constantly throwing their hands up in the air, saying, This isn't one of the end things you defined. I don't know what to do now,” says How.
AMPS, in other words, is for future generations of autonomous machines, such as robot cars, who will inevitably find themselves in situations that programmers didn't have the foresight or bandwidth to prepare them for. Some cities, for example, can become a jaywalking free-for-all when the sun sets, forcing vehicles to creep through a steady flow of emboldened humans. A sheltered, suburban robot car that's only seen pedestrians waiting patiently at crosswalks might do what robots so often do in novel, inexplicable situations, and grind to a halt. Meanwhile, a more city-based driverless vehicle may have more experience with this nightly quagmire of casual daredevilry and low-speed risk assessment. If these two bots stop at the same traffic light, and are able to effectively share their data, they might reconcile their disparate observations. The suburban model could break out of its stupor (or avoid falling into one in the first place) and proceed with a sufficient mix of caution and determination. The city slicker robot isn't necessarily benefiting from learning about how humans behave in places where car culture reigns supreme, but maybe it picks up a trick or two related to blind driveways or rogues barreling down the breakdown lane.
Collaborative learning could be accomplished by other means, such as hooking machines up to an extensive, always-on network, where entire server farms can churn through clashing labels and update robots as needed. And the RoboEarth project, a self-described “Wikipedia for robots,” hopes to establish a universal knowledge base for bots to access. But AMPS' advantage is its ability to work where constant network access isn't an option, whether that means a gravel road in the Australian outback, or a crater gouged out of the surface of Mars. This approach focuses on robot-to-robot communication, without the luxury of powerful back-end systems. It essentially increases the autonomy of autonomous machines, and creates a foundation for meaningful learning. “We're thinking about it this in the context of lifelong learning,” says How. “That means a robot could be out somewhere for a year operating on its own, and it doesn't have to keep coming back and asking questions. Robots could roam around, just like people do, interacting individually or in pairs, finding ways to learn from each other.”
It's far too early to know whether the AMPS algorithm will make its way into autonomous cars. But, as How points out, driverless vehicles are one of the main concerns at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (the MIT research center that he's affiliated with). A more short-term application might be in exploration or observation-based robots. Considering that this project was funded by the Office of Naval Research, a military system with a knack for teamwork seems entirely feasible. In the long run, though, collaborative learning is bigger than any single class of robot. It's promise is the creation of more self-reliant bots, who don't have to be walked through every task, and spoon-fed every relevant piece of data. Because if we surrender to the urge to anthropomorphize robots—and it's hard not to—the autonomous ones are barely on their feet, and only occasionally out of diapers.
The Thread and the Flower Garland
The story about the importance of a good company
Dan Kocherga Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 29, 2017
Let's give this one a try:
guṇavajjanasaṁsargād yāti nīco'pi gauravam |
puṣpamālāprasaṅgena sūtraṁ śirasi dhāryate ||
☝️The First Part
Translating word by word…
👉🏻 guṇavajjanasaṁsargād
A compound word: gunavat + jana + saṁsargād
guṇavat → someone endovered with good qualities, virtuous
jana → a man
saṁsarga → conjunction
Word ending ād refers to the ablative case, which means the reason of something. So the whole word is like “because of the conjunction with a virtuous man”
👉🏻 yāti
Means “he comes to something”
👉🏻 nīco'pi
Two words are actually here: nīcaḥ + api:
nīcaḥ is a “person of a mean quality”.
api means “even”.
👉🏻 gauravam
The word gaurava means importance, respectability, high value.
We could read this as an opposite to nīcaḥ (see above).
So the whole first part is:
Even the mean person comes to importance because of the conjunction with a virtuous man.
✌️The Second Part
Okay, the “wise part” of this verse is done. Keep reading to see a beautiful example.
👉🏻 puṣpamālāprasaṅgena
The long one…
puṣpamālā → a garland of flower
prasaṅga → a link or connection
Word ending ena refers to instrumental case, so the long word is “through the connection with a garland of flower”
👉🏻 sūtraṁ
Simple — a thread 〰️
👉🏻 śirasi
śiras is a skull or a head.
This is a locative, meaning “on the head”
👉🏻 dhāryate
Means “is located”, or “lies”, or “resides at”.
This verb is used in a special form (called causative) which adds a subtle meaning, that something is forced to be located somewhere.
Oka-a-a-y:
The thread lies on the head through the connection with a garland of flower.
🤷‍♂️ WTF ?
Let's look at this again:
Even the mean person comes to importance because of the conjunction with a virtuous man.
The thread lies on the head through the connection with a garland of flower.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Ken Whisenhunt's inflexibility has been a theme during the Tennessee Titans' dreadful season.
On Friday, in their weekly appearance on my Nashville radio show, The Midday 180, Titans general manager Ruston Webster explained some of the franchise's rigid thinking.
“I think flexibility is a big part of being in this league. Whether it's being or the head coach or the offensive coordinator or anybody. I think with a 53-man roster, you have to have some flexibility.
“I know he's working to adapt to what they have…
“I want flexibility, in our coaches and our scouts and everybody because that's important. It's also important that they have a philosophy and a system. And my experience has been when a coach tells you, 'Just give me the player and I'll make it work,' it's probably not going to work.
“You need a coach who has a stark philosophy that can give you guidance so that you can bring players into the building. It might not help you right now where we are in our current situation, as you said, but it is important going forward.
“I know that Tony Dungy was that way. They had a stark philosophy on defense; there wasn't any bending when it came to the corner position. There would be players that could cover man to man all over the field but if they didn't tackle, we didn't want them [in Tampa.]
"So we knew exactly, when our scouts went on the road, exactly what we were looking for. We were looking for Ronde Barber. We weren't looking for the ultimate cover corner. So I think that's very important that we have philosophies offensively and defensively.
“When a coach tells me he'll take whatever we have and make it work, then I get a little nervous…
“It's so much easier to scout when you know exactly what you are looking for.”
Here's the whole conversation with Webster.
That's an interesting assessment that sheds some light on how they are thinking. And I will try to expand on it with Whisenhunt when I have the opportunity.
Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., is the latest high-profile Republican to back away from Grover Norquist and their pledge not to raise taxes.
“I'm not obligated on the pledge,” Corker told Charlie Rose on CBS on Monday. “I made Tennesseans aware, I was just elected, the only thing I'm honoring is the oath I take when I serve, when I'm sworn in this January.”

Corker joins a number of other Republicans who have indicated they would consider bending on the pledge to prevent a set of automatic cuts from taking effect should budget negotiations fail.
“I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,” Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., told a local Georgia news station. “If we do it their way then we'll continue in debt, and I just have a disagreement with them about that.”
“I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform,'' Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday.
Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., agreed: “A pledge you signed 20 years ago, 18 years ago, is for that Congress,” they said on "Meet the Press." “For instance, if I were in Congress in 1941, I would have supported a declaration of war against Japan. I'm not going to attack Japan today.”
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., have similarly distanced themselves from Norquist.

Colin A. Young, State House News Service - WORCESTER, Mass. (SHNS) - One year after it became legal for adults to possess and use marijuana in Massachusetts, cannabis aficionados will gather in Worcester this weekend to show off some of the best locally-sourced ganja and edibles, and to try to put a welcoming face on the world of weed.
Part competition, part expo and trade show, the inaugural Harvest Cup sponsored by the Massachusetts Grower Advocacy Council, MassCann/NORML and the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance will feature a spate of speakers from various segments of the marijuana industry and live demonstrations of how to use cannabis products in cooking and art. It runs Saturday and Sunday at Worcester's DCU Center.
The Harvest Cup is also a contest to discern the best marijuana products from the Bay State and a chance for Massachusetts marijuana growers "to show other regions that our growers and producers know a thing or two about cannabis," organizers said.
"It's an opportunity for locals to showcase their skills and we're also hoping it's an opportunity for the general public to come out and look at that world to see that it's not a scary place, as they might think," Peter Bernard, president of the Massachusetts Grower Advocacy Council, said.
The contest drew 73 entries in six categories: flower, edibles, concentrates, non-solvents, oils and tincture, and topicals. A panel of 21 judges selected from various parts of the local industry and advocacy community sampled and scored the entries over a period of about two and a half months, Bernard said.
"Because of public consumption rules, it wouldn't have been legal for us to do it in a public setting. Even if it was, we had about 75 different entries and a lot of that was edibles. There's no way to fairly judge that in one weekend," they said.
Bernard said MassCann/NORMAL prepared packets with samples of the entries for each judge, and each judge would visit ProVerde Labs in Milford once a week to pick up their next group of entries to judge.
When judging edible entries, Bernard said judges were careful to judge only one entry a day to make sure their score was fair and to avoid any cross-contamination between entries. Judges could try two or three entries in the flower and concentrate categories a day, they said.
Judges knew nothing about the entries they were given to score, and based their scores on "smell, taste, look, how well it burned and, of course, how good the effect was," Bernard said.
The winners of four categories will be announced Saturday, and judges will announce the winners of the remaining categories and an overall winner Sunday. Attendees will not be able to sample the entries -- the entire event is a "non-consumption event," per organizers -- but the entries will be on display in a glass case with information on the grower, the strain, the THC content and more.
"Believe me when I tell you, they sent us their very best," Bernard said of the entries.
At 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, a group of growers from Boston-based cannabis culture club Beantown Greentown will attempt to roll a 100-foot marijuana joint, a feat that Bernard said will likely involve the effort of about 40 people.
On its website, the club said the joint will be rolled using "1,000 grams of our own personal trimmings and stashes." It is unclear exactly what will happen to the joint once it is rolled.
Speakers will discuss topics including the history of the legalization movement, infusing components of marijuana into fresh mozzarella, opportunities to invest in cannabis and hemp stocks, advancing female entrepreneurs in the marijuana industry and an update on the in-progress Massachusetts marijuana regulations.
The weekend will get underway Friday night with a VIP kickoff party, held on the one-year anniversary of it becoming legal for adults to possess, grow, gift and use marijuana in Massachusetts.
The weekend's events are all limited to people 21 or older. Tickets cost $40 and a two-day package is available.
WASHINGTON — For President Donald Trump, what's good for General Motors is great for American workers. Same for Boeing. And AT&T. Not to mention small businesses.

Trump insists that slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to as low as 15 percent would free up valuable cash. Companies would use the money to boost investment, increase employees' pay, accelerate hiring and speed economic growth. What's more, corporations that now keep trillions overseas to avoid U.S. taxes would bring the money home. American companies could better compete with rivals based in countries with lower tax rates.
“We're going to have magnificent growth,” Trump declared aboard Air Force One on Thursday. “We're going to go like a rocket ship.”
Would we? Many economists, tax experts and even some business owners say it's unlikely. Rather than hire, companies might use much of their tax savings to buy back their stock or increase their dividends to investors. Many companies, they note, have already been able to borrow at historically low rates to expand their businesses yet have chosen not to.
“The mainstream economic evidence is that the bulk of corporate tax cuts go exactly to whom you would expect — which is wealthy investors and executives,” said Chye-Ching Huang, deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Many economists foresee some benefits from overhauling and simplifying the corporate tax code, just not the extreme growth Trump is promising.
One reason corporate tax cuts might provide little overall benefit is the relative health of today's economy. Unemployment is already unusually low at 4.4 percent. The economy is in the ninth year of a slow but steady expansion, rather than in a downturn in which tax cuts might deliver a major boost.
In a 2014 paper, two economists — Alexander Ljungqvist of New York University and Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve — concluded that state corporate tax cuts did little to strengthen economic activity unless the cuts were made during a recession. (The flip side is that they found corporate tax increases to be “uniformly harmful.”)
Nor have previous efforts to reduce corporate taxes generally delivered as advertised. Kansas, for example, exempted hundreds of thousands of businesses from corporate taxes and cut individual rates in 2012, only to face a revenue squeeze as the intended economic growth never materialized.
The federal government provided a tax “holiday” on overseas profits in 2004 to bring money back into the United States at a discount to the 35 percent rate. But the Obama administration observed later that the move had diminished tax revenue and unintentionally led companies to hoard cash abroad in hopes of receiving that discount.
There is also concern that a corporate tax cut would swell the federal budget deficit. When the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center published an analysis this week, it found that even if virtually all tax breaks were eliminated, the corporate rate could drop only to 26 percent without increasing the deficit.

Still, many companies stress that lower business taxes would lead to more hiring. John Stephens, AT&T's chief financial officer, said their company faces a typical tax rate of 34 percent — including federal, state, foreign and deferred taxes — in any given year.
Stephens estimates that lower rates would lead the company to immediately invest more money in its phone network, which they said would lead to more hiring by companies that work with AT&T.
“When we buy more equipment, our vendors hire more,” Stephens said. “When we build more extensive networks, we have people — hard-hat jobs — building those networks.”
The AT&T executive added that “anything” would be an improvement on the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.
But like many corporations, AT&T also benefited substantially from tax breaks between 2008 and 2015, saving as much as than $38 billion, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The administration has yet to spell out all the possible tax breaks that would be eliminated to pay for lower rates.
Even if the tax rates were slashed substantially, not all companies would see much of a reason to hire more workers. Bill Parks, who owns NRS, an Idaho-based boating gear company, says the tax cuts championed by Trump would no longer do much to help their business.
Years ago, the lower rates would have helped them because they were maxing out their personal credit cards and taking a second mortgage to fund NRS. But today's borrowing rates are so low that investing in workers isn't a burden, and tax changes would make little difference to their plans based on how their company is structured.
Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, has argued that the planned tax cuts would help small businesses. By cutting taxes on profits that typically double as the owners' personal income, those companies would then be able to hire more freely. This assumes that business owners want to expand their payroll rather than just enjoy higher profits.
Larry Summers, a Democratic former Treasury secretary, this month rattled off a list of reasons to reporters why lower corporate tax rates wouldn't deliver as promised.
Though U.S. companies do face a high rate compared with other countries, Summers said, the fraction of profits being paid in federal taxes is low by historical standards. Corporate income taxes collected last year equaled just 1.6 percent of the economy, according to government records. That compares with 4 percent during the economic boom that followed World War II, an era of growth that Trump appears to want to revive.
Nor, in Summers' view, would rising stock prices from a lower corporate tax rate shore up the pensions of firefighters, police officers and blue collar workers, as Cohn has argued.
Those few Americans who still have traditional “defined benefit” pensions don't receive any additional income if the stock market rises, Summers said.
“The argument being made that the corporate tax cuts will somehow benefit workers is weak by the standards of ‘trickle-down' arguments,” Summers said.

Do you hate the fact that Facebook is forcing you to install the Facebook Messenger app if you want to send or access messages on your iPhone or iPad?
We do too. But luckily, it turns out that right now, there's an easy way to get around the restrictions and access your Facebook Messages through the vanilla Facebook app again. But better move on it: Facebook's not likely to let this loophole stay open for long.
The trick is pretty simple, as Lifehacker explains:
1. Head into the Facebook app and tap the Messages tab. 2. Tap the Installation Messenger button. 3. When your phone switches over to the App Store, tap download, then immediately hit the stop button. This cancels the download. 4. Go back to the Facebook app and enjoy your messages.
Another option is to download Facebook Paper, which is like a prettier default Facebook app. Messages also still work there just fine. And alternatively, if you're on a jailbroken phone, you can install a simple tweek called FBNoNeedMessenger.
Facebook's not going to let all of these loopholes stay open forever, though. If you want to take advantage of the Paper or Facebook tricks, better get a move on.

Rice ranked No. 1 for best quality of life and racial interaction
Rice University is preparing to invest over $150 million in strategic initiatives aimed at increasing its research competitiveness, establishing a world-renowned program in data sciences and bolstering its position as one of the leading centers for molecular nanotechnology research. less Rice University is preparing to invest over $150 million in strategic initiatives aimed at increasing its research competitiveness, establishing a world-renowned program in data sciences and bolstering its ... more Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Rice ranked No. 1 for best quality of life and racial interaction 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Rice University has two No. 1 spots in the 2016 edition of the Princeton Review's “The Best 380 Colleges”: the Best quality of life and lots of race/class interaction.
The rankings are based on surveys of 136,000 students at 380 top colleges. Students responded to 80 questions about academics, administration, the student body and themselves. The guide published the top 20 schools in 62 categories.
Rice appears on four other lists in the college guide:
-- No. 9 for happiest students.
-- No. 14 for best health services.
-- No. 16 for great financial aid.
-- No. 19 for best-run colleges.
“We're very pleased that on the basis of student surveys, Rice was ranked No. 1 in the country by the Princeton Review for the best quality of student life, which reflects a broad range of measures,” Rice President David Leebron said. “That quality of life supports students' educational experience and achievement. But we are even more gratified with our No. 1 ranking for interaction among students of different racial, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. Diversity at Rice isn't just a matter of statistics, but how our students actually experience their education.”
The Princeton Review's profile of Rice quotes a student who said, “Most students respect other students and enjoy learning more about people who have different backgrounds and beliefs than their own.” Another student noted that professors “are very accessible and happy to talk about the material and give help outside of class.” And another said, “Students at Rice work hard and accomplish great things in academics and extracurriculars. But this is complemented and supported by a thriving social life.” The guide also cites a “very inclusive” environment at Rice and a description of the student body as “extremely collaborative, friendly, accepting and social - it's not cliquey.”
Including the 2016 guide, the Princeton Review has ranked Rice No. 1 or 2 for best quality of life nine times since 2007, and Rice's ranking for lots of race/class interaction has been in the top 10 eight times. Rice has also ranked in the top 10 for happiest students six times.

April 27, 2011 4:05 pm ET — Jamison Foser
In an interview with CBS yesterday, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) claimed their proposed budget does not cut taxes for the wealthy or corporations. That probably comes as a surprise to anyone who has actually read Ryan's "Path to Prosperity," which is full of references to lowering tax rates. As The New Republic's Jonathan Chait has explained, Ryan's budget does, in fact, cut taxes for the rich. There isn't really any question about that — the only question is how Ryan justifies their claims to the contrary. And the answer is: through a combination of duplicity and outright lies.
Let's start with the duplicity:
Q: Do you think that you would be getting more support out there if you didn't include this big tax cut for the wealthy as part of your plan? RYAN: We're not doing that. So, we're not, we're not agreeing with the president's tax increases.
Ryan never got around to explaining what they meant by that, but they were presumably referring to the scheduled expiration of the tax cuts originally signed by President Bush and extended by President Obama last December. Ryan's argument is that allowing tax cuts to expire as scheduled is a tax increase, and that making them permanent does not count as a tax cut. Nonsense. By that logic, permanently extending the expiring elements of the 2009 stimulus package would not constitute additional spending. But you'd have to be a fool to believe Ryan would apply their tax cut logic to spending. Therefore, Ryan's argument is dishonest and fraudulent.
As Chait notes, Ryan's budget also calls for the repeal of last year's health care reform, which "imposes a 0.9 percent surtax on wages and a 3.8 percent surtax on interest, dividends, and capital gains," both of which "only apply to filers in the top two income brackets." (In 2010, only individuals making more than $171,850 or married couples making more than $209,250 fell into the top two brackets.) Repealing the health care law would therefore lower those taxes for the wealthy. Therefore, Ryan's claim that their budget does not cut taxes for the wealthy is dishonest.
When CBS' Nancy Cordes pointed out that Ryan's budget calls for a huge reduction in top tax rates, Ryan's double-talk really got impressive:
Q: Well, 35 to 25 percent is a big cut. RYAN: But, in exchange for losing their tax shelters. So, we're saying, we call it revenue neutral tax reform. ... So we're saying, in exchange for losing their tax shelters, the wealthy and corporations get no tax shelters, we lower everybody's tax rates so we have a better economy. So we have better economic growth. So we don't tax our producers more than our foreign competitors tax theirs. So nobody's talking about cutting taxes for the rich. We're talking about reforming the tax code, cleaning it up, keeping revenues where they are. ... The whole point is to clean up the tax code, get rid of tax shelters so we can lower taxes on everybody. That's the kind of tax reform we're talking about.
If you read that closely, you may have noticed that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. On the one hand, Ryan claims that the reduced tax rates will be offset by the elimination of tax shelters, and so therefore do not count as a tax cut. On the other hand, Ryan claims that as a result of the changes, we won't "tax our producers more than our foreign competitors tax theirs." Ryan can claim their tax plan reduces U.S. corporate taxes relative to those found in other countries, or that it does not cut taxes on corporations — but if they make both claims, as they did in the CBS interview, he's clearly lying about one of them.
Likewise, page 50 of Ryan's Path to Prosperity says their budget "draws on the commonly held view that the key to pro-growth tax reform is lowering tax rates while broadening the tax base — that is, letting individuals keep more of the money they earn." Again: Ryan can argue that their plan lets people "keep more of the money they earn," or that their reduction in the top tax rates is fully offset by the elimination of tax shelters — but not both.
Finally, as Chait explained, Ryan is specific about the tax rate reductions they favor, but vague about the shelters and loopholes he'd close, making their claims of revenue neutrality impossible to credit:
Ryan implies that their plan would leave the rich paying the same effective tax rates as they do now because he's "getting rid of loopholes and deductions, which by the way are enjoyed by the top [tax] rate filers, the people in the top two brackets." But they haven't put out any details. [...] The Tax Policy Center examined various proposals to reduce tax deductions while using the revenue to lower rates across the board. All the plans decreased the tax burden for the top-earning 1%. The problem is that tax deductions are just not worth as much to very rich people as low tax rates.
Finally, Ryan claims that their tax proposals are just like those found in the Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission:
The tax reform we're proposing is just like the tax reform the president's bipartisan fiscal commission is proposing, supported by the majority of Democrats on the fiscal commission.
That's completely false. One clear indication of its falsity is the fact that Paul Ryan opposed that commission's tax proposals:
[T]he Commission relies too heavily on revenue increases, $2 trillion over decade, with the tax collections reaching 21 percent of gross domestic product [GDP]. Increasing the government's take from the economy hinders growth, and the lack of comprehensive health care spending reforms and a cap on total spending ensures that these revenues will chase higher spending and not be used for deficit reduction.
That was Paul Ryan last December. Now they pretend their tax proposals are "just like" the commission's proposals. They know they aren't. He's lying in order to pretend their plan isn't a far-right fantasy. (Just like when they claim Alice Rivlin supports their attempt to replace Medicare with a voucher system.)
It should long ago have become obvious that Paul Ryan is neither "serious" nor "brave." Their misrepresentation of their own tax plan shows that they aren't principled, either.
Early 2012 has seen the tablet market continue to grow, and Apple remains at the head of the pack, according to a new report from NPD DisplaySearch. In the first quarter of 2012 Apple reportedly shipped 13.6 million iPads, which was good enough to capture 62.8 percent of the tablet market during that period. Those numbers were no doubt bolstered by the release of the third-generation iPad in March, which saw brisk early sales. Samsung followed with 7.5 percent market share (1.6 million units), while Amazon came in a distant third with four percent (900,000 units) — an especially interesting estimate as Amazon is traditionally tight-lipped about Kindle shipment data. And all of those shipments have lead to a 124 percent year over year growth for tablets in general. While they aren't exactly the same, these shipment numbers paint a similar picture to an IDC report released earlier this month.
The DisplaySearch report also looks at shipments of both notebooks and "mini-note" PCs during the same period, and things are much less clear-cut in that category. HP held the number one spot shipping 8.9 million units for 16.2 percent market share, trailed by Acer (11.9 percent), Lenovo (10.6 percent), and Dell (10.2 percent). Overall the category saw just 12 percent growth compared to the same time in 2011. However, when you combine the two categories into what DisplaySearch calls the "mobile PC" market, Apple still maintains a healthy lead with 22.5 percent market share, double that of second place HP. Of course, 80 percent of that comes from iPad sales — maybe we are heading towards a post-PC era after all.
Republicans on Capitol Hill are once again aiming to defund Planned Parenthood, and Beltway oddsmakers are wagering that they have the best chance of succeeding in a long time.
What might defunding mean for Massachusetts, which has five Planned Parenthood clinics? Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, says its clinics could no longer provide services to patients who get their health care through MassHealth, the state's Medicaid program.
The cuts would total about $2 million in MassHealth services a year, affecting roughly 10,000 patients and up to 10 percent of the league's budget, they say.
Here's our conversation, edited:
Dr. Roshak: A lot of people assume Planned Parenthood is just a line item in the budget somewhere. In fact, it's not. We provide services for patients. We provide health care: pap smears, screening services, family planning, sexually transmitted infection testing, all of that. And we then provide a bill just like any other doctor's office, and when MassHealth pays the bill, about 90 percent of that money comes from the federal Medicaid budget. So that is what's at risk.
There are absolutely zero federal dollars that pay for abortion, so there's never any money anywhere, in any state, including in Massachusetts, that comes from the federal government to pay for abortion.
So the irony here is that the money that potentially could be cut, if this goes through, is all impacting preventive care and family planning.
And we are currently at the lowest rate of abortion and teen pregnancies ever. And the reason we are there is because patients have had expanded access to preventive care, to excellent forms of birth control, to birth control without co-pays, to long-acting reversible contraceptives with high efficacy. Those are the dollars that are being threatened now.
What are the numbers for Massachusetts?
We see overall about 30,000 patients in 50,000 visits across the state — and about 30 percent of our patients would be affected by that MassHealth/Medicaid cut for family planning and preventive care.
So something like 10,000 patients?
Right, and they would have to find care someplace else. A lot of times you hear the rhetoric on Capitol Hill: "Well, patients should just find another provider, they can go to a community health center, they can just go find someplace else." And the reality is, even here in Massachusetts, 40 percent of the towns have little or reduced access to primary care, and primary care means pap smears, STI testing, birth control, that's very much a primary care opportunity. So for patients even in Massachusetts, where we think we've got services everywhere, it really becomes a burden.
Is access mainly a problem in central and western Massachusetts?
There are many ways that there are barriers to care for patients. Sometimes it's geographic. Sometimes it's related to stigma. About 20 percent of our patients come to see us even though they have a primary care OB/GYN someplace else. But they'd rather not have STI testing with their primary care clinician, or they don't want to be seen going into the health center that's in their neighborhood. That patient confidentiality piece is very critical as well. So there are many barriers to care.
Could Massachusetts offset or buffer federal defunding?
There could be state mitigation, but what would happen is that the state would have to make up the difference.
The reality is that we expect defunding to happen in waves, and this is the first wave. Then there will be a second wave and a third wave. There are multiple ways that funding will be chipped away, and we in Massachusetts will be affected. So anywhere from 10 percent to up to close to 50 percent of our budget could be affected.
What other waves do you expect?
Things like attacking and eliminating Title X. Title X was legislation put into place by President Nixon in the 1970s, and it was always intended, and continues to be, family planning availability for low-income women and families. So everywhere across the country, providers can provide low-income women with free family planning and pap-smear screening, those types of basic gynecological care. We fully expect that will be one of the waves. We also expect there could be some waves of attack on sex education.

Mohammad Amir and Azhar Ali are set to return to the Pakistan side for the five-match ODI series against New Zealand, set to begin from January 6. Amir (shin injury) and Azhar (knee injury) have recovered from their respective injuries that had ruled them out of the ODI series against Sri Lanka in October.
Meanwhile, left-arm spinner Imad Wasim (knee injury), and left-arm pacers Junaid Khan (foot stress fracture) and Usman Khan (back stress fracture) have been ruled out of the series.
While Mohammad Nawaz, who last played an ODI in January, has come in as a replacement for Imad, uncapped pacer Aamer Yamin has also been included. Ahmed Shehzad has been left out of the side to accommodate Azhar.
The rest of the squad, led by Sarfraz Ahmed, wears a similar look to the one that beat Sri Lanka 5-0 in the UAE. Apart from Yamin, Umar Amin and Sohaib Maqsood were also called for a fitness test by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), but couldn't make it to the final squad.
"The team has been selected keeping in mind the conditions and the recent performances of some players in the domestic tournament," Inzamam-ul-Haq, chief selector, said. "Azhar Ali makes a comeback to the ODI squad after being rested in the ODI series against Sri Lanka.  They are making a comeback, having regained full fitness.
"Junaid Khan has been ruled out of the ODI squad due to a fracture in their right foot and doctors have advised them to rest for six weeks. Aamir Yamin comes in to replace the left arm pacer in the squad. Imad Wasim is again feeling discomfort in their knee, and has been told to work on their fitness in the NCA."
Squad: Sarfraz Ahmed (c), Azhar Ali, Fakhar Zaman, Imam ul Haq, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Hafeez, Haris Sohail, Faheem Ashraf, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali, Aamer Yamin, Rumman Raees

Recent events remind us again that tornados often have a sad and deadly cost for the victims in its path. even an F-3 tornado can cause devastation and the total destruction of everything in its path. Homes are reduced to matchsticks, office buildings to piles of rubble. In 1997, the tornado that hit Jarrell, Texas, actually ripped the pavement right off a roadway. Tornadoes can destroy lives and possessions outright, and the after effect of their cost to a business can be felt long after the wind dies down.
The cost to clean up and restore the tornado-ravaged areas is rather surprising. Any tornado can steal irreplaceable data or keepsakes, however there have been only a few tornados that create horrific damage that captivates the news for weeks and rank off the charts in recovery costs. F-5 tornadoes have the potential to do damage of a billion dollars per tornado. Here's where the numbers are interesting. In today's money, three quarters of all tornadoes between 1953 and 2013, resulted in damages under $50,000. 300 of the 1200 tornadoes that occurred in this period did more than $50,000,000 in damages. Six percent created over $500,000 in damages. Yet, the top nine in this period did more than $6,000,000,000 in cumulative damages. The tornado that hit Oklahoma City in 2013 created, by itself, more than $2,000,000,000 in damages.
Tornados have occurred on every continent except Antarctica but, by far, the overwhelming majority occur in “Tornado Alley” in the United States, an area that includes parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, with some areas being more vulnerable than others. Between 1953 and 2013, 32 counties in the USA suffered 3 tornado disasters; 2 counties in OK suffered 4, 3 counties in Arkansas suffered 5 and Lonoke County in Central Arkansas was hit by 6 tornados.
One quarter of businesses that close after a disaster never reopen. All too often, that's because they lose their data and recreating it, if possible, is simply cost-prohibitive. The only failsafe data disaster recovery lies in having networks and data backed up or replicated in more than one geographically and environmentally safe, remote location.

While we have seen Chicago flags, maps, skylines and tattoos of pretty much every Chicago sports team, local artist Jeremy Scheuch's latest piece is as original as it gets (photo from Bethany Cisco):
Yes, that is former Governor Rod Blagojevich. And a Chicago style hot dog...and some sausage pizza.
Scheuch sent some photos of their new body art to Chicagoist, who can tell you more about their work here. They got the tattoo last night--just after opening statements wrapped up in the Blagojevich corruption trial.
Bethany Cisco of Tattoo Factory in Uptown did the piece.
Prime Minister David Cameron will lose the UK general election in May because the right-wing vote is divided, a former aide claims.
Alex Deane, who was chief of staff of the Conservative Party in 2005, said the rise of UKIP means fewer votes will be cast for the Conservative Party.
Dean also pointed to the “collapse” in the Tory's grass roots support as a potential cause of their defeat.
The Conservative Party will lose the “ground game” to Labour because they don't operate as well on a local level, they told Public Affairs News on Friday.
Deane is now UK managing director of public affairs at FTI Consulting, a business advisory firm.
“The basic scenario in this Parliament has been clear for a while and remains unchanged in 2015: UKIP up, dividing the right, Lib Dems down, uniting the left,” they said.
“This becomes stronger as the election nears, because Labour's ground game with unionists, volunteers and activists is far better than the Tory machine, which has been hollowed out at a local level – no amount of solid by-election campaign efforts can plaster over that collapse in the grassroots when facing the challenge of a general election.”
“Research supports these intuitive points: I am that rare thing, a Tory who believes in polling, and seat by seat analysis is pretty wretched for the Conservatives. So, despite Miliband rather than because of him, my prediction for May is a Labour victory."
Their comments come as a YouGov/Sun poll published on Friday indicates Labour and Conservative support is tied.
The poll indicates Labour had a one percent lead over the Tories, with UKIP the third most popular party at 15 percent.
A fall in Conservative support last December saw Labour take a seven percent lead in the polls.

The Conservative Party's hold on the right-wing vote has been under serious threat from the UK Independence Party (UKIP) since the European Elections last May.
UKIP won the highest share of votes in the European Parliament, taking 27.49 percent of votes in contrast with the Tory's 23.93 percent.

Five months later, UKIP struck again when former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell announced their decision to change political allegiance to UKIP, prompting a by-election.
UKIP won the seat with a 35 percent lead over the Tories.
This story was repeated in November last year with the Rochester and Strood by-election, which saw UKIP win again with 44 percent of the vote.
Labour is not without its own election worries however, as it risks losing the majority of its support in Scotland.
A Guardian/ICM poll published on 26 December 2014 found the Scottish National Party (SNP) had 48 percent of voter support, in stark contrast with Labour's 24 percent.
Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy announced a plan on Monday to target 200,000 voters who formerly supported Labour but who switched to the SNP following the independence referendum in September 2014.

Scotland, historically a Labour heartland, was a key source of support for the party in the last general election, fielding it with 40 Westminster MPs.
Rising support for Nathalie Bennett's Green Party is also a major cause for concern among Labourites, as is evidenced by their warning to would-be Green supporters.
Senior Labour MP Sadiq Khan cautioned that: “Every vote for the Green Party only makes it one vote easier for the Conservatives to win.”
The Green Party has significant support among young people having attracted 25 percent of the student vote in the European Election last year, more than Labour's share of the vote, according to Tim Wigmore of the New Statesman.
While the Green's polling figures have remained around the 7 percent mark since last October, a surge in their support could see them dividing the left-wing vote in much the same way UKIP is dividing the right.
