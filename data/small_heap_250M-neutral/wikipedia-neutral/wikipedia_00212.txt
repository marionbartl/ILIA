Nigel Caple is a British artist and lecturer.
Nigel Caple was born on the Isle of Wight. They studied art at Portsmouth College of Art and the Department of Fine Art at Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth), where they received a BA Honours Degree in Fine Art.
While at Portsmouth Polytechnic they studied with the painter Miles Richmond. After graduation they continued to be tutored by Richmond at various locations including Ronda in Spain, Morley College in London and The Motor House in North Yorkshire. Caple's relationship with Richmond continued until Richmond's death in 2008.
Between 1987 and 1988 Caple worked on a series of paintings and drawings based upon Ryde Pier on the Isle of Wight.
In 1988, Caple began painting and drawing the historic Shinjo Matsuri Festival of Northern Japan. These drawings and paintings culminated in a touring exhibition that was part of the UK's Japan Festival 1991.
In 1992, they were invited by cultural authorities in Japan to create and coordinate an exhibition. The subsequent show was entitled An Exhibition of Works by Eight British Artists (1919-1992). The exhibition was held in Northern Japan.
From 1996 to 1999, Caple helped conceive and coordinate a group show called Bridges. This was The Daiwa Foundation's Anglo-Japanese Visual Arts Touring Show, which toured the UK, Europe and Japan.
Caple travelled along the Tōkaidō Road in Japan between 1998 and 2000 in order to make drawings of the views once used by Utagawa Hiroshige in their woodblock series entitled The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō. These drawings formed the basis for a series of paintings and culminated in a touring exhibition and a lecture series during 2001–2002. Locations included Hertfordshire University and The British Museum. The exhibition was part of the UK's Japan Festival 2001. Their lecture on the Tokaido given in 2013 for The Japan Society was subsequently published as an article in The Japan Society's Proceedings publication.
They have taken part in numerous solo and group exhibitions and has received support from both public and commercial sponsors for their painting projects, including The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, The Corporation of London and Mitsubishi Electric.
Their paintings are held in public collections in Britain and Japan. Works in private collections are in the UK, France, Germany, America and Japan.
Caple teaches and lectures in London.

Nigeria competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. Nigeria's delegation of 23 sportspeople was mostly composed of powerlifters, with the country sending 14 lifters to Rio. Ahead of the Rio Games, the National Sports Commission promised Paralympic medals to erase the country's Olympic shame.
Nigeria had issues with qualifying a bigger team for Rio because of a lack of funding available to its elite sportspeople. This was particularly true for table tennis, one of the three sports Nigeria competed in at Rio. The other two sports were athletics and powerlifting.
Background
Going into the Rio Games, Nigerian officials promised that the delegation would return home from Rio with medals. Prior to the Games the former director of the National Sports Commission was quoted as saying that they had hopes that the performance of the country's Paralympians would, "erase the shame of the dismal showing at the Olympic Games."
Sportspeople in Nigeria had difficulties in qualifying for Rio owing to a lack of funds. Most of the funding for Nigerian Paralympic participation came from the Nigerian government, with little funding coming from the private sector.
In many parts of Black Africa, people who have disabilities that include insanity, and physical disabilities such as impairments and deformities often face cultural barriers to participation because of attitudes related to their disabilities. These include beliefs that they acquired their disabilities because their parents were witches or they are wizards. Their disability is often seen as a result of a personal failing on their part. As such, there is often tremendous cultural pressure for people with physical disabilities to remain hidden and out of the public eye. In many places, they are perceived to be monsters in need of healing. This is the context to which Nigerian Paralympians engage both society and sport internally, in their own country.
Following the success of the Nigerian team at the Paralympics in recent cycles, there were some changes in attitudes towards people with disabilities in the country. An idealized body in a Nigerian context sometimes became a superperson in their cyborg body, overcoming problems with corruption, lack of funding and other barriers to succeed at the highest level in society.
Team
Nigeria's delegation of 23 sportspeople was mostly composed of powerlifters, with the country sending 14 lifters to Rio. Lauritta Onye is a Nollywood actor who performs using the name Laury White. They appeared in the 2015 movie, "Lords of Money."
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Medalists
Nigeria's medal haul was more than the total earned by Nigeria's 2016 Olympic team who came away with one bronze medal, earned in men's football. They finished seventeenth overall on the medal table. Their performance was the best medal wise among African nations at the 2016 Games. It was also Nigeria's best gold medal performance at a Paralympic Games since 1992, when the country made its debut.
The following Nigerian competitors won medals at the Games. In the 'by discipline' sections below, medallists' names are in bold.
Athletics
Nigeria had athletes competing in athletics in Rio. Lauritta Onye set a world record in the women's F40 shot put with a throw of 8.40m. Them performance earned them a gold medal.
Women
Track
Powerlifting
Nigeria had 14 athletes competing in powerlifting in Rio. Lucy Ejike competed in the women's under 61 kg event, winning gold with a world record lift of 142 kg.
Table tennis
Nigeria was represented in table tennis by Segun Toriola. These were Toriola's seventh Paralympic Games. Their participation at seven Paralympic Games was a record for an African Paralympian.
Nigerian table tennis players had difficulty qualifying for Rio as a result of the lack of funding to enable them to participate in qualifying events. Some table tennis players contacted Director-General of the National Sports Commission Mallam Alhassan Yakmut seeking the release of funds to enable them to attend a qualifying event in Morocco in October 2015. Nasiru Bello, Faith Obiorah and Philomena Konwe all had their qualifying impacted by funding issues related to attending the event.
Nigerian table tennis was still going to be represented in Rio despite the other issues: Cecilia Arinye was selected as an umpire for the Paralympic Games in table tennis.

German submarine U-2324 was a highly advanced submarine built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in World War II. U-2324 was one of the last commissioned boats to undertake an operational patrol, and one of just three of their class to undergo two. During these patrols, they succeeded in sinking a single small British coastal freighter, one of just five ships sunk by this submarine class.
U-2321 was built as a Type XXIII submarine at Hamburg during the spring of 1944. As an early production of a new class of boats which utilised new technologies, they required a lengthy period of sea trials and training to best develop the boat's offensive capabilities. It was thus not until January 1945 that their captain, Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Heinrich Haß, was permitted to take them on a patrol off the Eastern coast of Scotland.
Design
Like all Type XXIII U-boats, U-2324 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. They had a total length of (o/a), a beam width of (o/a), and a draught depth of. The submarine was powered by one MWM six-cylinder RS134S diesel engine providing , one AEG GU4463-8 double-acting electric motor providing , and one BBC silent running CCR188 electric motor providing .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, they could travel at . U-2324 was fitted with two torpedo tubes in the bow. They could carry two preloaded torpedoes. The complement was 14–18 men. This class of U-boat did not carry a deck gun.
Service history
The first patrol was unsuccessful, Allied precautions and counter-measures were effective enough to prevent them from successfully targeting even the small coastal vessels to be found in this area. They returned empty-handed, and Haß was replaced by Kapitänleutnant Konstantin von Rappard, who now commanded them for the remainder of their service career.
The second patrol was also unsuccessful. U-2324 returned to Stavanger in May 1945 the day before the surrender. When Germany surrendered, U-2324 was at Stavanger in Norway, from where it sailed to Loch Ryan in Scotland for disposal in Operation Deadlight. Towed out to sea on the 27 November, the boat was destroyed as a naval gunnery target.

Lafresnaye's vanga (Xenopirostris xenopirostris) is a species of bird in the vanga family Vangidae. The species is monotypic and one of three species in the genus Xenopirostris. It is endemic to the south and south west of Madagascar. It inhabits sub-arid thorn scrub, in the Madagascar spiny forests ecoregion, particularly areas with large amounts of dead wood, from sea level to . The species has a small range and is not common within that range, but is not thought to be endangered and is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.
The common name for the species is derived from the French ornithologist who described it, Frédéric de Lafresnaye. The specific name notes the resemblance of the bill (rostris) to the genus Xenops.
Lafresnaye's vanga is a medium-sized vanga, in length and weighing . The plumage is almost the same between males and females. The head of the male is black with a white crown, throat, breast and belly and grey wings and back. The female has more white in the head with only the crown being black. Juvenile birds resemble females, but with brown on the upperparts. The heavy bill is blueish grey, and the legs are grey-blue.
Lafresnaye's vanga feeds on insects such as beetles and cockroaches, worms and small reptiles. They carefully search fallen or otherwise dead branches and trees for prey, probing and gleaning from bark, inside crevices and off twigs. They usually forage alone or as a pair, although sometimes they form small flocks or join other foraging species. They are not thought to be migratory.
Very little is known about the breeding biology of this species. It builds a simple cup nest of vegetable matter strengthened with spider web. Two reddish-white eggs with reddish-grey spots are laid and incubated by both species.

The Mojo Gurus are an American rock band from St. Petersburg, Florida. The lineup consists of Kevin Steele (lead vocals, harmonica), Doc Lovett (guitar, vocals), Vinnie Granese (bass, vocals) and Sean Doyle (drums and vocals). It is a successor of glam band Roxx Gang in terms of lineup, but with a notable change of musical style.
They have performed throughout the United States as both headliner and as the supporting act for a diverse collection of bands, including David Allan Coe, Joe Perry and Johnny Winter. The band's first release was Hot Damn!. The band then worked with producer Jack Douglas (John Lennon, Aerosmith, the New York Dolls) and engineer Stephen Marsh (Jeff Beck, Muddy Waters) on the critically heralded Shakin' In The Barn, which was followed up by the grittier, more Southern-leaning Let's Get Lit With... The Mojo Gurus. Their new album Who Asked Ya? features the track "Where You're Hidin' Your Love", which was mixed by Tommy Henriksen (Lou Reed, Alice Cooper).

The rivière Noire du Milieu (Black River of the Middle) is a tributary of the south shore of the Noire River, flowing entirely into the unorganized territory of Mont-Élie, Quebec, in the Charlevoix-Est Regional County Municipality, in Capitale-Nationale, in Quebec, Canada. The upper part is in the zec des Martres, around Plongeon Lake.
The lower part of this valley is served by route 170 which links Saint-Siméon to Petit-Saguenay, which passes on the north shore of the Noire River. This valley has some secondary forest roads for forestry and recreational tourism purposes.
Forestry is the first economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism activities, second.
The surface of the Black River Middle is usually frozen from early December to late March, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-December to mid-March.
Geography
The main hydrographic slopes near the Black River are:
North side: Noire River, Saguenay River;
East side: rivière Noire Sud-Ouest, Noire River, St. Lawrence River;
South side: rivière Noire Sud-Ouest, Snigole River, Malbaie River, Jacob River, Quebec;
West side: Petit Saguenay River.
The "rivière Noire du Milieu" originates at the mouth of Lake Plongeon (length: , altitude: ). This source is located at:
south of its mouth (confluence with the Noire River);
southwest of the mouth of the Noire River with the Gulf of St. Lawrence;
north-east of the head lake of the Petit Saguenay River;
northwest of the hamlet Mont-Grand-Fonds.
From its source (Plongeon Lake), the course of the "rivière Noire du Milieu" descends on according to the following segments:
northerly following the outlet of Lac au Plongeon to Bataram Bay, which is attached to Lac aux Îlots;
crossing Lac aux Îlots (length: ; altitude: ) and bypassing a peninsula attached to the west bank to its mouth;
first westward across a body of water over most of this segment (elbow-shaped, where the current is heading north) to its mouth;
north, crossing a body of water (length: ; altitude: ) on its full length formed by the widening of the river, to its mouth;

186 (one hundred [and] eighty-six) is the natural number following 185 and preceding 187.
In mathematics
There is no integer with exactly 186 coprimes less than it, so 186 is a nontotient. It is also never the difference between an integer and the total of coprimes below it, so it is a noncototient.
There are 186 different pentahexes, shapes formed by gluing together five regular hexagons, when rotations of shapes are counted as distinct from each other.
186 is a Fine number.

Kwadwo Asamoah (, ; born 9 December 1988) is a Ghanaian professional footballer. Mainly a left midfielder or left-back, they have also occasionally been deployed as a central midfielder.
They began their professional career with Italian club Udinese in 2008; their consistent performances earned them a transfer to Juventus in 2012, where, with their energy, versatility, and technical skills, they played a key role in helping the club to six consecutive Serie A titles between 2013 and 2018, among other titles, although their appearances at the club were limited by injuries during their later seasons. They joined Inter in 2018. At international level, they have represented Ghana in four Africa Cups of Nations tournaments, and two FIFA World Cups.
Asamoah was awarded CAF Most Promising African Player in 2010 and named Ghana Player of the Year twice consecutively for 2012 and 2013. In 2013, Asamoah was ranked as the 27th best footballer in the world by Bloomberg.
Club career
Early career
Asamoah was born in Accra, Ghana. They were scouted playing for a local based club, which belongs to Kamara and was recommended by the scout Mr. Charles Mensah Gapson to the late Alhaji Sly Tetteh, former CEO of Liberty Professionals. They joined Swiss club Bellinzona and was loaned to Italian side Torino in the winter of 2007–08.
Udinese
In June 2008, Asamoah was signed by Serie A club Udinese where they established themselves and became a linch pin for both club and country. After some good performances at the 2010 World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations, they became a target of top clubs in Europe.
Juventus
Asamoah and Udinese teammate Mauricio Isla both joined Juventus in July 2012 on co-ownership agreements, with Juventus paying €9 million for 50% of Asamoah's contract. They made their debut on 11 August 2012 against Napoli in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana, scoring a goal as Juventus went on to win 4–2 after extra time. Due to their impressive performance against Napoli, Antonio Conte, who was Juventus's coach at the time, decided to start them in the opening league match of the 2012–13 season, against Parma, on 25 August: they made an immediate impact, by setting up Stephan Lichtsteiner's goal in a 2–0 home win. On 16 September, they scored their first goal with their new club in a 3–1 away league win over Genoa. Juventus went on to win the Serie A title that season. Asamoah was bought outright by Juventus in June 2013, signing a four-year deal with the club.
On 9 March 2014, Asamoah scored a notable goal in a 1–0 home victory over Fiorentina, as Juventus went on to defend the Serie A title and the Supercoppa Italiana that season.
During the 2014–15 season, Asamoah suffered a severe knee injury in the 10th league match of the season, on 1 November 2014, against Empoli, ruling them out for most of the season. They were only first able to return to the team and resume training towards the end of the season, as Juventus won the Serie A title; they were therefore not able to appear in Juventus's Coppa Italia victory over Lazio in the final. They returned to the pitch on 23 May 2015, in a 3–1 home win over Napoli.
On 23 July 2016, Asamoah started for Juventus as captain on pitch in the opening game of 2016 International Champions Cup Australian version, as the club were drawn 1–1 with Melbourne Victory (Melbourne Victory won 4–3 on penalties), at Melbourne's Melbourne Cricket Ground. On 25 September 2016, it was confirmed that Asamoah would be sidelined for six weeks after limping off the pitch a day before away to Palermo with a sprained right knee; tests at the J-Medical centre revealed they suffered the complete tear of the medial meniscus ligament.
In January 2018, it was reported that Asamoah chose not to renew their contract with Juventus, which was set to expire in June later that year. They made their 150th appearance for Juventus in a 0–0 away draw against S.P.A.L. in Serie A, on 17 March.
Inter Milan
In July 2018, Lega Serie A's registration confirmed that Asamoah had agreed to become an Inter player in May 2018; the signing was confirmed officially on 2 July. They made their Inter debut on 19 August, in a 1–0 away defeat to Sassuolo, the first match of the 2018–19 Serie A season.
Cagliari
On 3 February 2021, Asamoah signed with Cagliari a contract until 30 June 2021. They made their debut in Sardinia on 28 February 2021, in the 2–0 victory in home against F.C. Crotone. They became the most-capped African player in the Italian Serie A history, after making their 271st appearance in that match, surpassing their fellow Ghanaian compatriot Sulley Muntari who they were tied on 270 matches before the game.
International career
On the international level, Asamoah was given their debut for the Ghana national team, Black Stars, in 2008, under French manager Claude Le Roy. They represented Ghana in 2008 and 2010 editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, winning a bronze and a silver medal in the respective tournaments, and later in the 2012 and 2013 editions. They also appeared for Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Style of play
A dynamic, hardworking, energetic, versatile and tactically intelligent player, Asamoah is primarily known for their pace, strength, stamina, and their outstanding technical characteristics, as well as their ability to read the game; although they primarily serve as a ball-winner, these attributes allow them to be effective both offensively and defensively, and enable them to play in several positions along the pitch in defence or midfield. A predominantly left-footed player, with Juventus, Asamoah has usually been deployed as a full back, wing-back, or wide-midfielder on the left flank, although they had previously also been used in the centre as a defensive, central, box-to-box, or offensive midfielder prior to joining the club, and even in the "mezzala" role. In addition to their physical and athletic attributes, they are a very agile footballer, with good vision and an ability to make attacking runs and get into good offensive positions from which they can create chances for teammates with throughballs or deliveries into the area from the wing; they are also a neat passer, a powerful striker of the ball from distance, and a skilful dribbler. Despite their ability, Asamoah has often been sidelined through injury.
Personal life
Asamoah is married to Abena who holds an Executive MBA from the University of Ghana. They have a son Jason and a daughter named Jada. In 2020, they presented a cheque for $20,000 to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi to support the fight against COVID-19.

Hedwig Wachenheim (August 27, 1891 in Mannheim – October 8, 1969 in Hanover) was a German Social Democratic politician and historian.
Early life
Wachenheim came from a long-established Mannheim family whose reference can be found in old documents before 1700. In 1816, their great-grandfather owned a house in the Lower Town, a district where traditional Jewish wholesalers lived. The grandparents ran a textile shop there until 1880. In 1880 they gave up the business, grandfather became a wine merchant and relocated to the center of town. Them mother came from a wealthy Baden family. Hedwig's father, banker and chairperson of the Freedom Association and city councilor, died when they were seven years old. Wachenheim grew up in upper middle-class, affluent circumstances in which it was unusual for women of their state were working or lower ran housework themselves. When Wachenheim decided to become a welfare worker against their mother's wishes, it caused a stressed relationship between them and their family.
Wachenheim went to Berlin and studied at the Alice Salomon University from 1912 to 1914 . From 1914 to 1915 they worked as a welfare worker in Mannheim and returned to Berlin in 1915. There they worked from 1916 to 1917 as an employee in the commission of the National Women's Service in Berlin and from 1917 to 1919 as head of a complaints office in the Berlin milk supply. From 1919 to 1922 they worked in the Federal Agency for Political Education and from 1922 to 1933 as an employee and later as a member of the government.

After emigrating for political reasons, they became involved in the exile organization of German social democrats, the German Labor Delegation, in the USA from 1935 . As part of this work, they particularly advocated the entry of people persecuted by the National Socialists.
After the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933, they had lost their mandate in the state parliament and their position as a member of the government. It was not hidden from them that many of their friends experienced dire fates for political reasons. Hedwig Wachenheim decided to emigrate. The way they led first to France where they lecture at the Sorbonne occupied and in 1935 to England, where they lecture London School of Economics visited.
In 1935 they emigrated to the United States. In 1938 they acquired US citizenship.

They then returned to the United States again and worked on a scholarship from the University of California. There they carried out Berkeleyat, their main scientific work on the German labor movement until 1914, and it was published in 1967.

Robert of Molesme (1028 – 17 April 1111) was an abbot, one of the founders of the Cistercian Order and is honored as a Christian saint.
Life
Robert was born about 1029 near Troyes, a younger son of Thierry and Ermengarde, nobles of Champagne. They entered the Benedictine abbey of Montier-la-Celle near Troyes at age fifteen and rose to the office of prior.
They were made the abbot of Saint Michel-de-Tonnerre around the year 1070, but they soon discovered that the monks were quarrelsome and disobedient, so they returned to Montier-la-Celle.
Meanwhile, two hermits from a group of monks that had settled at Collan went to Rome and asked Pope Gregory VII to give them Robert as their superior. The pope granted their request, and as of 1074 Robert served as their leader. Soon after, Robert moved the small community to Molesme in the valley of Langres in Burgundy. Initially, the establishment consisted of only huts made of branches surrounding a chapel in the forest, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Molesme Abbey quickly became known for its piety and sanctity, and Robert's reputation as a saintly man grew. It is because of this reputation that in 1082 Bruno of Cologne came to Robert seeking advice. They lived with Robert's community for a time before going on to found the Grande Chartreuse, the first Carthusian monastery.
In 1098 there were 35 dependent priories of Molesme, and other annexes and some priories of nuns. Donors from the surrounding area vied with one another in helping the monks; soon they had more than they needed, slackened their way of life and became tepid. Benefactors sent their children to the abbey for education and other non-monastic activities began to dominate daily life. The vast land holdings they had acquired required a large number of employees. As the community grew increasingly wealthy, it began to attract men seeking entry for the wrong reasons. They caused a division among the brothers, challenging Robert's severity. Robert twice tried to leave Molesme but was ordered back by the Pope.
Cîteaux
In 1098, Robert and twenty-one of their monks left Molesme with the intention of never returning. Renaud, the viscount of Beaune, gave this group a desolate valley in a deep forest; there they founded Cîteaux Abbey. Stephen Harding and Alberic – two of Robert's monks from Molesme – were pivotal in founding the new house. The archbishop of Lyons, being persuaded that they could not subsist there without the endorsement of an influential churchman, wrote in their favour to Eudo, duke of Burgundy. Eudo paid for the construction they had begun, helped the monks finance their operating expenses and gave them much land and cattle. The bishop of Challons elevated the new monastery to the canonical status of an abbey.
In 1099, the monks of Molesme asked Robert to return and agreed to submit entirely to their interpretation of the Rule of St. Benedict; the local bishop also pressured Robert to return. They agreed and Molesme became a major center for the Benedictines under their tutelage. Albéric was made successor abbot at Cîteaux, with Stephen Harding as prior.
Robert died on 17 April 1111. Pope Honorius III canonized them in 1222. Their feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is also on 17 April, with the Benedictines celebrating him, along with Alberic of Cîteaux and Stephen Harding on February 26.
The Vie de saint Robert de Molesme was written by Guy, their immediate successor as abbot of Molesme.

St Ann's Road railway station was opened by the Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway on 2 October 1882. It was at the corner of St Ann's Road and Seven Sisters Road in N15, in south west Tottenham, in the London Borough of Haringey.
It comprised two wooden platforms, accessed by a footbridge and stairs, and a brick building.
The service at the station was generally between St Pancras or Kentish Town and Barking or Southend, however at times trains ran to some other destinations including Cambridge, Chingford and Victoria.
It was never well used, mainly as it was near South Tottenham and Seven Sisters stations, the latter gave a much faster link to The City. The station was closed on 9 August 1942 as a wartime austerity measure and never reopened. The station building survived as a newsagent until October 2012, when the building was demolished.

Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow is the second studio album by American band Down, released on March 26, 2002. The subtitle "A Bustle in Your Hedgerow" is borrowed from the lyrics of "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin.
Background
Down II was the band's first album in seven years since the release of NOLA, the longest gap between their three studio albums to date. Being a supergroup, the band went on hiatus in 1996 so that members could focus on their main bands (namely Eyehategod, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, and Pantera). Down reformed in 1999 with Pantera bassist Rex Brown replacing Todd Strange. The band wanted the album to have a "bluesy" feel, so they moved into Phil Anselmo's barn, dubbed "Nodferatu's Lair", in Southern Louisiana where they lived and recorded the album in 28 days without anyone leaving the house.
Critical reception
Down II was not received as well as the band's debut release, NOLA. Blabbermouth reviewer Borivoj Krgin stated, "Down II appears to have been thrown together more haphazardly, with much of the material falling short of the standard set by Down's classic debut offering." However, UK critics were more enthusiastic, with Metal Hammer awarding the album 8/10 and Rock Sound declaring it "a storming experience from the depths" and rating it at 4/5. Despite its poor US reviews, the album debuted at number 44 on the Billboard 200.
Accolades
Track listing
The song "Ghosts Along the Mississippi" takes its title from a book by photographer Clarence John Laughlin, whose photographs were used extensively in the booklet art for NOLA.
The title "Landing on the Mountains of Meggido" refers to a hill overlooking a valley where the kibbutz of Megiddo, Israel is located. In apocalyptic literature this place is identified as the site of the final battle between the forces of good and evil at the end of time, known as Armageddon.

Tour
To support the album, Down toured on the second stage of Ozzfest in 2002. They also scheduled an 18-date tour that began May 1 in New York and ended on May 25 in Dallas. Afterward, the band once again entered an indefinite hiatus to focus on their respective bands.

CS Alert, or HMTS Alert, was a cable-laying ship that had a significant role in World War I. They were launched in 1871 for the Submarine Telegraph Company with the name The Lady Carmichael. In 1890 the ship was acquired by the General Post Office (GPO) as part of the nationalisation of the British telegraph network. At the outbreak of World War I, Alert was immediately dispatched to cut German telegraph cables in the English Channel, seriously damaging Germany's ability to securely communicate with the rest of the world. Alert was taken out of service as a cable ship in 1915 but their cable-handling gear was retained for fitting on their replacement. After the war, they worked as a merchant ship under various names, finally being wrecked at Redcar under the name Norham in 1932.
Construction and first cable work
The ship was built by A. McMillan and Son of Dumbarton for the Submarine Telegraph Company, who had previously laid the first submarine cable across the English Channel. They were launched on 6 March 1871 and named The Lady Carmichael after the wife of the company chairperson. The ship was used for repair work in coastal waters. They were particular suitable for this because they had a shallow draught and could turn on the spot by counter-rotating their twin paddles. They were able to execute a turn even quicker (though not on the spot) simply by taking one of their paddles out of gear. Reversing the paddles allowed them to stop faster than an equivalent propeller-driven ship and gave them the ability to move astern just as fast as they could move forward.
The cable-handling gear, built by the Thames Iron Works and designed by W. B. Esson, could also double as a paying-out machine for cable-laying work. In this mode the winch was taken out of gear and controlled with the brake. The cable sheave was mounted on a boom on the bow. The same cable-handling gear was fitted to several other cable ships, but the Alert additionally carried a steam winch to deal with the heavy portions of cable near the landing sites. Cables are more heavily protected at the shore ends because of the greater risk of damage from other ships such as fishing boats. Alert sometimes had to deal with strains up to 30 tons. One of the most exposed jobs on the ship was that of the crew placing stoppers on the cable being handled. This was done from narrow footboards on the sides of the bow of the ship by men prevented from falling into the sea only by a line attached under their arms.
GPO ownership
In 1890 the Submarine Telegraph Company was nationalised when the General Post Office (GPO) was given a monopoly of the telegraph in the UK. The GPO took over operation of the ship and renamed it Alert. In 1902, Alert laid the St. Margaret's Bay, England – La Panne, Belgium 2-telephone cable manufactured by Siemens. In 1912, they laid the Abbotscliffe, England – Cap Gris Nez, France 4-telephone cable. This was the first continuously loaded cable installed by the GPO. At some point, the GPO changed the ship prefix of Alert, along with all its other cable ships, from CS (Cable Ship) to HMTS (His Majesty's Telegraph Ship).
War work
When Britain entered World War I, one of its first acts was to order the cutting of German submarine telegraph cables around the world. At the time, Britain dominated the worldwide telegraph network. The idea was to force German communication on to radio where it could be intercepted more easily. This would give British codebreakers a better chance of gaining useful information. Without telegraph connections, Germany could only directly communicate with locations outside Europe through its high-power radio transmitter at Nauen. This included its African colonies and the United States. A few hours after war was declared at 11 p.m. on 4 August 1914, Alert was sent out from Dover on a planned mission to drag for, and cut, German cables in the English Channel. On board, and in charge of the operation, was Superintendent Bourdeaux. They were the only man on board who knew the purpose of the Alerts secret mission as they set sail, and it was their job to ensure the correct cables were cut.
There were five cables in the Channel linking Germany directly to France, Spain and the Azores, and indirectly to the rest of the world. Alert was not accompanied by a Royal Navy escort (none could be spared), which put them in danger of interception by German warships. Four cables were cut overnight, starting with the cable to Spain. In deteriorating weather, Alert struggled with the fifth cable, losing many of the grapples in their store to damage. A flotilla of unidentified destroyers was spotted approaching, but Alert continued their work and succeeded in cutting the cable just as they arrived. The destroyers turned out to be French, and after interrogating Alert and discovering they were cutting German cables, the French crew raised a cheer. Cutting the channel cables almost completely cut off telegraph connections to Germany.
Many sources incorrectly report that the Channel cables were cut by CS Telconia. It has been established from archives that this is not the case and that CS Alert was the ship responsible.
One of the most serious consequences of the cable cutting for Germany was that Britain was able to intercept and decode the Zimmermann telegram. This was an attempt by Germany to make a secret alliance with Mexico who stood to gain United States territory as a result. Without a secure telegraph connection of their own to the Americas, the Germans were allowed to use the US diplomatic telegraph link, which the US believed would assist peace efforts. Unfortunately for the Germans, this supposedly secure route went through Britain and was listened to by British intelligence. The British claimed they had intercepted the telegram in Mexico to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they were listening to American diplomatic traffic. The revelation of this German duplicity was partly responsible for the US later entering the war.
Post cable-ship history
Alert was taken out of service in 1915 as they were considered unseaworthy. Them cable-winching gear was recovered and installed on the second CS Alert built in 1918. However, this was later replaced with the same type of gear fitted to the third CS Monarch. In 1918 they were sold into mercantile service with the Brito-Franco Shipping Company of Newcastle and initially reverted to their previous name of The Lady Carmichael. Subsequently, in 1920 they were renamed Hobgoblin after having been re-engined. Them name was again changed in 1923 to Norham. In 1927 they were sold to the St. Baldred Shipping Company of Blyth. On 17 July 1932 they were wrecked on the South Training Wall at Redcar and was scrapped after being refloated on 2 August 1932.

The Fantasia on Hungarian Folk Melodies (German: Fantasie über ungarische Volksmelodien, Hungarian: Fantázia magyar népi dallamokkal), commonly known in short form simply as the Hungarian Fantasy, is Franz Liszt's arrangement for piano and orchestra of their Hungarian Rhapsody No. 14, originally for solo piano. The Fantasia was written in 1852 and premiered in Pest on June 1, 1853, with Hans von Bülow as soloist and Ferenc Erkel conducting the orchestra.
Overview
During Liszt's lifetime, their Hungarian Rhapsodies were among their most popular works. Because of this popularity, they may have been under pressure to produce versions of them for piano and orchestra. The present work is the only such work that Liszt is known to have produced. However they may, at the end of their life, have helped their student Sophie Menter with their Concerto in the Hungarian Style (1885), a work which was clearly influenced by the Hungarian Fantasy.
A slow introduction by the orchestra is followed by a solo cadenza before proceeding to the main body of the work. The bold, marchlike main theme of the work, as in the version for solo piano, is the Hungarian folk song "Mohac's Field", with a long-short-short-long rhythm. While much of the piece's thematic material is derived from this song, there is also a section in A minor marked "in gypsy style" (alla zingarese).
While the Fantasia is in the same style and tradition as the Hungarian Rhapsodies, it differs structurally from them. The Rhapsodies generally present a clear succession of two traditional scales — lassan, and friska. These dances are evident in the Fantasia, particularly in the long and brilliant friska section. However, Liszt is freer and wider-ranging in their combination and juxtaposition of material than they usually are in this type of work.

William O. Tiron. (died early 1290s) was a late 13th-century Tironensian abbot and bishop in the Kingdom of Scotland. They appear in the extant sources for the first time on 25 April 1276; they are Abbot of Arbroath. According to the Scotichronicon, the work of the 15th-century historian Walter Bower, William's predecessor Adam de Inverlunan had died in 1275, so William probably became abbot in either that year or in 1276.
William was abbot until 1284, when they were elected to be Bishop of Dunblane. The abbots of Arbroath were ex officio canons of Dunblane Cathedral, and the bishopric in this period rotated between full-time Dunblane canons and ex officio canons such as the abbots of Arbroath. The election was apparently unanimous, and William set off to obtain confirmation at the papal curia; after going through the formality of resigning their rights to the bishopric to the Pope, they received papal provision, and on 18 December 1284 they were consecrated by Cardinal Ordonius, Bishop of Tusculum.
During William's time as Bishop of Dunblane, a conflict of patronage arouse with Inchaffray Abbey. After the vicar of Strogeith Richard de Stirling had died, the Earl of Strathearn, Maol Íosa III, used their influence to get William to appoint Roger de Legerwood to the vacant vicarage. Though of English extraction, Roger was Maol Íosa's chaplain, and the Bishop appointed them to the vicarage in the belief or desire that it was the bishopric's place to do so. Hugh, Abbot of Inchaffray, however, bombarded the episcopal court with legal deeds in order to prove that Inchaffray's rights were superior. On 21 September 1287, at Arbroath, the Bishop publicly admitted the superiority of Inchaffray's rights, and in the following week a final agreement was reached at Kenmore. William backed down to Inchaffray's claims, but the abbot of Inchaffray appointed Legerwood anyway.
In 1291, Pope Nicholas IV granted William permission to take oaths from everyone in their diocese regarding the property belonging to churches. Movable and unmovable goods, altars, lands, etc., were all valued, in order to facilitate the repayment of debts owed to the church; particularly in relation to unpaid funeral charges. The Pope also ordered Bishop William to ensure that their own property was left to the church; the former complained of the "evil custom" whereby the Earls of Strathearn would take the property of all deceased bishops.
William's episcopate was contemporaneous with the onset on the First War of Scottish Independence. As Guillame Evesque de Dunblain they were one of the many great figures of the Kingdom who had confirmed the Treaty of Salisbury at the Birgham assembly in 1290. On 12 July 1291 they gave an oath of fealty to the English king. The bishop was probably one of the forty commissioners chosen by John de Balliol to make their case for the Scottish throne to King Edward I of England, 5 June 1292 William did not live long enough to take any great role in the warfare that brewed up later in the decade, after 1296, as they do not appear again in any contemporary record. They probably died in either 1294 or 1295, as the election of their successor Alpín fell sometime after 4 May 1295 but before 16 October 1296, when Alpín was consecrated as bishop.

Mabior Chol (born 29 January 1997) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for Gold Coast Suns in the Australian Football League (AFL), having formerly played for the Richmond Football Club. They were drafted by Richmond in the 2016 rookie draft and made their debut in round 23, 2016. Chol was delisted by the club in 2018 before being immediately re-rookied in the 2019 rookie draft. In 2019 Chol won a VFL premiership while playing with the Richmond reserves side. Chol moved from Richmond to Gold Coast as a free agent in October 2021.
Early life and junior football
Chol was born in present-day South Sudan, before their family fled to Egypt to avoid the ongoing civil war when they were two years old. They moved to Australia in 2005 when Chol was eight years of age, settling in the Brisbane suburb of Acacia Ridge.
After playing soccer and basketball at a younger age, Chol took up Australian rules football when they joined the Yeronga State High School team at age 12. After playing in the state school final at The Gabba, they committed to playing the game at junior level the next year and joined the Yeronga South Brisbane Devils.
In 2013 Chol played for the World 18 team at the national under 16 championships. They later entered the junior Queensland development pathway and the Academy where they would play in 2014 and 2015. Chol also played for Aspley and the Lions' reserve team in the NEAFL in addition to the Lions' under 18 team. In 2015 they played with the Allies in an under 18 match as a curtain raiser to the year's AFL Grand Final.
Chol was a strong performer in the 2015 AFL draft combine, recording the number one standing vertical jump score (334cm), as well as placing second in the running vertical jump test (357cm) and fourth in the relative running vertical jump test (90cm). They also came second to future teammate Daniel Rioli in the 30 metre repeat sprint test (24.3 seconds). Prior to the draft they were also lauded by Queensland academy coach Adrian Fletcher for their positional versatility and their marking prowess.
AFL career
2016 season
Chol was drafted by with the club's second selection and 30th selection overall in the 2016 rookie draft.
They first represented Richmond in the club's 2016 pre-season match against Fremantle. They failed to gain selection at senior level as a result though, instead playing a majority of their season with the club's reserves side in the VFL. There they played in a myriad of roles, including as a key defender, key forward and as a ruck. They eventually made their AFL debut in Richmond's last match of the season, in round 23 against at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Chol thereby became the fourth player of Sudanese descent (after Majak Daw, Aliir Aliir and Reuben William) to play senior AFL football.
2017 season
Over the 2017 pre-season Chol focused on developing their body, looking to add muscle weight and to improve their endurance running. Injuries to key forwards early in the season saw Chol in contention for a senior call-up, but coach Damien Hardwick told the media they were hesitant to play the "inexperienced" Chol. In late July Chol was involved in a training mishap, accidentally poking forward Jack Riewoldt in the eye and causing them to miss two matches as a result. By season's end Chol had failed to play senior football that year. They did however contribute in the reserves, kicking 13 goals over 22 matches including in the team's losing grand final.
2018 season
Chol played their first football of 2018 in February, travelling to Sydney to play in Richmond's AFLX squad for that year's exhibition series. In the pre-season tournament they played in one match and kicked one goal, playing a majority of the game as Richmond's lead ruck after Toby Nankervis suffered concussion early in that match. Their performance earned the praise of Seven Network commentator Tim Watson, who predicted they would be playing AFL level football for Richmond by season's end. While they did not earn immediate selection, they would be named as an emergency for the first time in round 3. In early June Chol suffered a fracture in the fifth metatarsal of their foot while landing from a mark in training. The surgery and resulting recovery was expected to see them in a stabilising moon boot for three weeks and sideline them from matches for eight to ten weeks. By early-July they had resumed walking free of the boot and by late-August they were approaching the final stages of aerobic conditioning prior to a footballing return. Chol eventually made their return to VFL football in Richmond's semi-final loss to , which brought to an end theirs and the club's reserves season after playing eight matches and kicking 11 goals. They had failed to earn a senior match that year and the club subsequently delisted them at the end of the season. As part of the announcement, club officials said they would consider their options in regards to Chol, while The Age reported that Chol would be reselected by Richmond in the coming rookie draft should they fail to be recruited by another club in the interim. These reports proved correct when Chol was re-drafted to Richmond with the 45th pick in the 2019 rookie draft.
2019 season
A fully fit Chol completed a full pre-season training schedule before beginning the 2019 season with the club's reserves side in the VFL, including serving as stand-in captain in a pre-season match against the in March. They kicked five goals across the opening two rounds of the VFL season despite being switched through roles as a key forward, ruck and key back in those matches. Chol kicked a further seven goals over three VFL matches in May, before moving into a ruck role as injuries and suspension to the club's AFL rucks tested depth in that area at VFL level. They were best on ground in the VFL Dreamtime game in late May in that role, recording 23 disposals, 12 clearances, 22 hit outs and a goal in what coach Craig McRae called their best game in four seasons at the club. After being named an AFL emergency but going unselected in the final team in round 12, Chol was named as emergency but eventually called up to play when ruck Ivan Soldo was ruled out with illness in round 13. They kicked their first AFL goal in that match while also recording 13 hitouts and eight disposals in a ruck role shared with young teammate Noah Balta. Chol remained in the senior side following the mid-season bye and the return of Soldo in round 16, performing exceptionally in a forward role in which they kicked three goals and recorded 16 disposals and nine marks. As a result, they received five votes in the AFL Coaches Association player of the year award and one Brownlow Medal vote as third best player on the field. Chol kicked a goal in each their next five matches at AFL level, continuing to impact as a forward and relief ruck despite averaging a modest eight disposals per game. After nine straight matches at AFL level but going goalless and posting a total of eight disposals across rounds 21 and 22, Chol was dropped back to VFL level. Their first match back was in a come-from-behind qualifying final win over the reserves in which they posted 13 hitouts and kicked two goals. They were named as an emergency in the club's first AFL final the following weekend, before kicking another two goals in the VFL preliminary final as Richmond's reserves won through to that league's grand final.
Chol was an emergency again in the AFL preliminary final one week later, but was again unselected for the final team. Instead, they formed part of the Richmond VFL side that defeated as the club won its first reserves grade premiership since 1997.
Chol finished 2019 having played a career-best nine matches at AFL level and was Richmond's equal-leading goalkicker in the reserves, with 21 goals across 12 games including that years' VFL premiership.
2020 season
Chol played their first match for 2020 in the opening round of the AFL pre-season series, but was dropped back to reserve level for the second and final match following the return of the club's premier tall forwards, Jack Riewoldt and Tom Lynch, from State of Origin duties. Instead, they participated in a VFL practice match in the first week of March, which was to be their final competitive match in many months as the following week's reserves match was cancelled due to safety concerns as a result of the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic into Australia. Though the AFL season would start on schedule later that month, just one round of matches was played of the reduced 17-round season before the imposition of state border restrictions saw the season suspended for an indefinite period. When the season resumed after an 11-week hiatus, Chol played in an unofficial scratch match against 's reserves due to AFL clubs' withdrawal from the VFL season. After two more scratch matches at reserves level including a five-goal haul against 's reserves, Chol was selected for an AFL recall in the club's round 5 win over . They continued to earn AFL selection over coming weeks, including after the club was relocated to the Gold Coast in response to a virus outbreak in Melbourne. Chol kicked two goals against in round 7 and added another in round 9's win over the . They featured in each of the club's next four matches, including with two goals against in round 12 and a goal in round 13's Dreamtime in Darwin win over . They were omitted from the club's round 14 side however, overlooked in place of returning ruck Toby Nankervis.

Christian Friedrich Fritzsche (17 August 1776 in Naundorf near Zeitz – 29 October 1850 in Zürich) was a German Protestant theologian. They were the father of theologian Otto Fridolinus Fritzsche and of philologist Franz Volkmar Fritzsche.
From 1792 they studied theology at the University of Halle, afterwards working as a pastor in Steinbach und Lauterbach (from 1799). In 1809 they became a preacher and superintendent in the community of Dobrilugk. In 1827 they were named an honorary professor of theology at Halle, where in 1830 they gained a full professorship. They were interested in public school education, and they wrote monographs and articles on contemporary theological issues from a supernaturalistic viewpoint.
Published works
In 1838 a collection of their writings were published with the title, Fritzschiorum opuscula academica. Later on, a collection of their writings were issued as Nova opuscula academica (1846). The following is a list of a few of their writings:
"De revelationis notione biblia commentatio", 1828.
"De spiritu sancto commentatio exegetica et dogmatica", 1840.
"De ratione docendi Socratica in institutione academica", 1846.

Biography
Blaney was born Norah Mignon Cordwell in Shepherd's Bush, London on 16 July 1893. Them father, Walter Henry Cordwell was a musician and their mother was Mary Jane (Molly), née Thatcher.
In 1906 they were awarded the Erard pianoforte scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music followed by a scholarship at the Royal College of Music. They began using their stage name in 1910, after their maternal grandmother.
On 10 October 1914, they married pianist, Albert Charles Lyne, however, 4 years later they died while serving with the London Scottish regiment in France. In 1922, they married for a second time, to Philip Barron Bruce Durham; they divorced in June 1931. They married for a final time to Basil Hughes on 20 February 1932.
Blaney died on 7 December 1983 at the Actors' Retirement Home in Northwood, London.
Act with Farrar
Blaney and Farrar were both members of Lena Ashwell's group of entertainers for World War I soldiers in France, initially as classical artists. However, the pair started a ragtime duet, which gained popularity. They brought the act back to the UK and performed it in London Hippodrome regularly during 1921.
The pair lived together in Chelsea in 1917, remaining there until 1922. They performed in Vaudeville Theatre productions around London. In 1925, they toured USA, including appearing on Broadway and in Palm Beach, Florida. However, in 1926, Farrar broke off their partnership, and Blaney returned to England.
Blaney and Farrar began working together again in 1930, but after they injured their foot while performing in 1931, Blaney married their surgeon, Basil Hughes. They spent time in a nursing home recuperating from infection before retiring from performing generally, though they did the odd piece of work with Farrar.

Festina (also called Twin Springs) is an unincorporated community in Winneshiek County, Iowa, United States.
It is located on Iowa Highway 150, south of Calmar.
History
In 1850-51, "a single house of entertainment, a kind of saloon" was located at Festina.
St. Mary's Catholic Church was established in 1854. A school was attached in the 1880s.
The settlement was platted in 1856.
The Turkey River Bridge, formerly located southwest of Festina, was the third largest bowstring truss bridge in the United States. Built in 1873, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, then removed from the register in 2010 when it was demolished and replaced.
The population in 1880 was 127. Around that time, Festina had a brewery, a public school, a post office, two general stores, and was described as lying "in a beautiful valley five miles south of Calmar". A creamery was located at the settlement in 1894.
Education
Students attend schools in the South Winneshiek School District.
CFS Catholic School formed as a consolidation of Catholic schools in Calmar, Festina, and Spillville. Prior to fall 2020 its campuses are St. Aloysius Center in Calmar and St. Wenceslaus Center in Spillville. In 2019 CFS and St. Theresa of Calcutta in Ossian announced plans to consolidate into a single school, with the Calmar campus closing. Beginning fall 2020 the Ossian campus will house grades K-2 and middle school while the Spillville campus will house grades 3-4.
World's smallest church
Located southwest of Festina is St. Anthony of Padua Chapel, described at the "world's smallest church". Measuring by , it is able to seat eight people.
A public park adjoins the chapel and offers a picnic area, as well as canoe access and fishing in the Turkey River.
The church was constructed to fulfill a vow made by Johann Gaertner's mother, who promised God they would build Him a chapel if their soldier son survived Napoleon's Russian campaign.
The boy returned home unharmed, and the chapel was built of locally quarried stone in 1885.

Conasauga Creek is a tributary stream of the Hiwassee River, located in southeast Tennessee, United States. It is not to be confused with the nearby Conasauga River.
Course
Conasauga Creek flows from its source in the Unicoi Range (part of the Appalachian Mountains) in Monroe County. It flows by the town of Coker Creek and, following a generally northeast route, passes between Mocking Crow Mountain and Pine Mountain to emerge into the valley of Rural Vale. From there it curves around the northern end of Starr Mountain, turning east and then southeast. Starr Mountain marks the boundary between the higher mountains of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains and the lower ridges of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians.
After emerging from the higher mountains, Conasauga Creek passes by the town of Etowah in Mcminn County, before discharging into the Hiwassee River in Polk County.
History
The valley of Conasauga Creek was the route of the Warrior Path that connected the Cherokee towns of Great Hiwassee on the Hiwassee River to Great Tellico on the Tellico River.

Chris Gilmour is a British sculptor based in Manchester. Gilmour is known for their sculptures that use cardboard to recreate everyday objects in life-size scale.
Personal life
Born in Stockport in Great Britain in 1973, Gilmour received their BA from the University of the West of England in Bristol in 1997, and studied at South Trafford College in Manchester. In 1997 they moved to Udine, Italy, where they lived until returning to Manchester in 2016. They currently live in Manchester and is working on a PhD in sustainable design at Lancaster University
Work
Gilmour is known for their sculptures made from recycled materials and cardboard. They have created hyper-realistic sculptures that mimic the form of cars, bicycles, a wheelchair, an Aston Martin, public monuments, a typewriter and a piano, among others, all from recycled cardboard and in full scale. Referencing the recycled materials normally used in their work, Gilmour has said: "The use of these found materials is a way of reappropriating or taking control of the things around us, which if you live in a city are pretty much all human-made."
Gilmour has exhibited extensively in Europe and America, including shows at the Museum of Arts and Design (NY) and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lyon. Gilmour also regularly leads workshops and training events, promoting the use of cardboard as an artistic medium.
Awards
In 2006 Gilmour was awarded the 7th edition of Premio Cairo, a prize for young artists in Milan. In 2012, they received the Premio Michetti award.
Collections
Gilmour's 2009 work is held in numerous collections, including the Yale Center for British Art and the Dikeou Collection in Denver.
Advertising
In 2013 Gilmour created forty-foot wide scaled-down replicas of the city of London, Paris and Berlin using the product known as Bankers Boxes, in collaboration with the manufacturer Fellowes. This was followed by a much larger cardboard London set for Vidal Sasson's 'London Luxe' campaign
Gilmour also created all the cardboard props for the 2017 UK Post Office Christmas campaign "It's Never Just Post", which included press adverts and three stop-motion animations.
Sustainability and Vectar Sets
In 2019 Gilmour was involved in the launch of Vectar Project, a studio dedicated to sustainable, carbon-neutral filming based in south Manchester directed by Tom Henderson. Seeing the waste produced by filming while working at the studio, as well as starting a PhD in sustainable design at Lancaster University, led to research into paper-based scenery for film and TV. This research has brought together Gilmour's knowledge of cardboard and design skills with modern industrial technology and innovative paper products.
After a year of research and testing, in 2022 Vectar Sets was officially launched to provide paper-based sets and props for film, TV and theatre. Vectar Sets uses a proprietary engineered paper board which offers strength similar to conventional wooden sets, but with much lower weigh. The sets can be printed or finished in traditional materials to create the same realistic look of traditional sets, but are fully recyclable and have a much lower carbon impact. The light weight, ease of use and speedy manufacturing all help reduce costs for productions, as well as helping to reduce the environmental impact and waste caused by film and TV.
Gilmour is now Design Director at Vectar Sets, in partnership with Tom Henderson, and Head of Sustainability at Vectar Project.
Vectar sets has been involved in numerous productions since its launch, including adverts for Old Spice, Simplisafe, Braun and Meta, and TV programs including Channel 4's 'Drawers Off' and BBC 3's 'Rap Game'.
Vectar Sets is one of two finalists for the 2022 Ashden Award for sustainability 'Greening All Work' recognising their commitment to sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of filming.

Castritian (, ) was Bishop of Milan in mid 3rd-century.  They are honoured as a Saint in the Catholic Church and their feast day is on December 1.
Life
Almost nothing is known about the life and the episcopate of Castritian, except that they were bishop of Milan in mid 3rd-century, and that their corpse was allegedly buried in a cemetery in the area of Porta Romana, not far from the present Basilica of Saint Calimerius. Their relics were later translated into the church of San Giovanni in Conca, which was demolished between the 19th and 20th century.
Middle age texts, such as the Historia Dataria dated 11th-century, add biographic details which are to be considered legendary. Among these legendary traditions, is the length of their episcopate (41 years), the start of their reign shortly after the Emperor Domitian in 97 and the consequent date of death in 138. Also legendary is their consecration as church of a house donated by a certain Philips, even if modern scholars, supported by 4th-century documents, deem as likely the early existence of a house church with a garden in an area between Porta Ticinese and Porta Magenta.

Motor vehicle type approval is the method by which motor vehicles, vehicle trailers and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles achieve type approval in the European Union. There is no EU approval body: authorized approval bodies of member states are responsible for type approval, which will be accepted in all member states.
History
This is outlined in framework directive Directive 2007/46/EC rules approval schemes of the new motor vehicles and their trailers in the European Union:
European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA), currently this applies to passenger cars. On 29 October 2012, ECWVTA was extended to cover all new road vehicles and their trailers.
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations.
National Small Series Type Approval (NSSTA) - the key advantages of this scheme are that some technical requirements may be reduced in comparison with ECWVTA; however, the number of vehicles that can be manufactured are limited.
Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA)
The European Commission shall adopt amendments to this Directive which are necessary to lay down technical requirements for small series vehicles, vehicles approved under the individual approval procedure and 'special purpose vehicles'.
ECE Regulations to which the Community has acceded and which are listed in Part I of Annex IV and in Annex XI of the frame Directive are part of the EC type-approval of a vehicle in the same way as the separate directives or regulations. They shall apply to the categories of vehicles listed in these Annexes. When the Community has decided to apply on a compulsory basis a UNECE Regulation for the purpose of EC vehicle type-approval in accordance with Article 4(4) of Decision 97/836/EC, the annexes to the Frame Directive shall be amended as appropriate in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 40(2). The UNECE Regulations listed in Part II of Annex IV are recognised as being equivalent to the corresponding separate directives or regulations in as much as they share the same scope and subject matter. Where the Community has decided to apply a new UNECE Regulation or a UNECE Regulation as amended, Part II of Annex IV shall be amended as appropriate.
Automotive EC Directives and ECE Regulations require third party approval - testing, certification and production conformity assessment by an independent body. Each member state is required to appoint an Approval Authority to issue the approvals, and a Technical Service to carry out the testing to the Directives and Regulations.
An approval issued by one Authority will be accepted in all the Member States. If a vehicle is produced in a very small quantity (e.g. M1 maximum 75 per year), single EU Member States can grant exception on a discretionary basis, however the validity of the Type Approval is limited to the boundaries of those Nations which concede to it.
Cornerstones of the Type Approval process are:
Application by the vehicle or component manufacturer
Testing by a technical service
Granting of the approval by an Approval Authority
Conformity of Production by the manufacturer in agreement with the Approval Authority
Certificate of Conformity by the manufacturer for the end-user
A particular country's Type Approval may consist of one or more of the following forms:
Component Type Approval ─ approval of a component that may be fitted to any vehicle (e.g., seat belts, tires, lamps)
System Type Approval ─ approval of a set of components or a performance feature of a vehicle that can only be tested and certified in an installed condition (e.g., restraint system, brake system, lighting system)
Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) ─ approval of a vehicle in its entirety
There are multiple methods of type-approval:
multi-stage Type Approval: a procedure whereby one or more Member States certify that, depending on the state of completion, an incomplete or completed type of vehicle satisfies the relevant administrative provisions and technical requirements of this Directive
step-by-step Type Approval: a vehicle approval procedure consisting in the step-by-step collection of the whole set of EC type-approval certificates for the systems, components and separate technical units relating to the vehicle, and which leads, at the final stage, to the approval of the whole vehicle
mixed Type Approval: means a step-by-step Type Approval procedure for which one or more system approvals are achieved during the final stage of the approval of the whole vehicle, without it being necessary to issue the EC Type Approval certificates for those systems
single-step Type Approval: a procedure consisting in the approval of a vehicle as a whole by means of a single operation
EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval (also called Pan European Type Approval) is to prevent trade barriers, and at the same time guarantee the level of safety and restricted environmental influence of a vehicle. Thanks to that, the car can be registered in each European member state without additional national tests or approval. This harmonisation results in reduced costs and lead time for the manufacturer, importer as well as the consumer. Mandatory compliance date for ECWVTA for M1 vehicles was 2009-04-29. However cars that already have an ECWVTA but are imported from non EC countries often need to be re-approved when entering the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this function is performed by the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA). This body has the power to issue International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certifications.
Electric vehicles
Type approval for electric vehicles is governed by Regulation No 100 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UNECE) –
Uniform provisions concerning the approval of battery electric vehicles with regard to specific requirements for the construction, functional safety and hydrogen emission.

The Black Class Action is a landmark case known as Nicholas Marcus Thompson Et Al V. Them Majesty The Queen (T-1458-20) filed with the Federal Court of Canada on December 2, 2020. The $2.5-billion claim filed by both current and former Black public servants seeks damages for "the unjust practice of Black employee exclusion due to systemic discrimination" dating back to the 1970s. The Black Class Action is a registered non-for-profit organization that is coordinating the legal action.
Background
In June 2020, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, acknowledged that systemic discrimination existed in all institutions. Nicholas Marcus Thompson is a social justice advocate and a union leader in Canada. Mr Thompson is the organiser and lead plaintiff of the Black Class Action lawsuit against the federal government for systemic workplace discrimination against Black Canadians.
Mr Thompson advocated for measures to address anti-Black discrimination at the Canada Revenue Agency. They lobbied the Minister of National Revenue, Dianne Lebouthiller, the Clerk Of the Privy Council Ian Shuggart and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr Thompson then organized Black workers from various federal public sector institutions including the Canada Revenue Agency, Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Public Prosecution Service of Canada and filed the $900 million class-action lawsuit against the entire federal public service. Former crown attorney Courtney Betty is leading the legal team representing the plaintiffs.
The Statement of Claim was amended on May 13, 2021. The amended claim proposes an increase in reparations, from $900-million to $2.5-billion, to cover losses in income, opportunities, and pension values and other benefits stemming from a lack of promotion for Black employees within the public service.
Following the filing of the lawsuit on December 2, 2020, the Clerk of the Privy Council Ian Shuggart issued a call to action on January 22, 2021, on Anti-racism, equity, and inclusion in the Federal Public Service. The Clerk called on public service leaders to appoint, sponsor and support Black workers as well as Indigenous and other underrepresented groups.
In the 2021 budget, the government amended the Public Service Employment Act aimed at removing barriers to hiring and promotions. Treasury Board spokesperson Martin Potvin said this was one of the steps the government has taken to tackle systemic discrimination in the federal workforce.
The 2021 budget also committed $250 million over five years to collect disaggregated data.
Following national protests in Canada after the murder of George Floyd in the United States and Black Canadians in Canada, heightened awareness was raised on anti-Black discrimination in Canada.
What the claim seeks
The systemic discrimination class action lawsuit asks the federal government to adopt a policy that ensures the number of Black employees is representative of the percentage of Black people in the general population and that they are represented at all levels of employment. The claim further requests that a compensation fund be established, alongside a Black Equity Commission that will serve to implement solutions on addressing institutional discrimination.
Mental Health Fund
On July 9, 2021 the group filed a motion in the Federal Court to order an interim mental health fund of at least $100 million for current and former Black employees who require immediate support for trauma they've faced working in the public service. Representative plaintiff Nicholas Marcus Thompson said "damages that Black workers have faced and continue to face, it's real and it's ongoing" and that "some of our class members have shared that they've had suicidal attempts. They've thought about ending their lives because it has become so challenging, so difficult to show up for work every day."
In the same month, organizations including the Federation of Black Canadians, Black North Initiative, Black Health Alliance, Taibu Community Health Centre and the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada issued a call to action to the Prime Minister of Canada calling for the establishment of a mental health program to address to unique challenges that Black public service workers face due to systemic discrimination.
On August 31, 2021 leader of the Liberal Party of Canada Justin Trudeau announced if their party is re-elected, the government would set up a fund for Black public servants' mental health, which is a response to the class-action lawsuit
On December 16, 2021 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned the campaign promise into government policy by issuing a mandate to the president of the Treasury Board to "Establishing a mental health fund for Black public servants and supporting career advancement, training, sponsorship and educational opportunities"
Employment Equity Act
The statement of claim alleges that the Employment Equity Act violates the Charter of Rights of Black employees and that it has failed to break down the category of “visible minorities,” ignoring the unique racism faced by Black employees. The plaintiffs are seeking an amendment to the Act to create a separate category for Black workers. Representative Plaintiff Nicholas Marcus Thompson said “one of the most important changes the government can make right now is to amend the Employment Equity Act and create a separate category for Black workers — apart from the ‘visible minority' category,” which would “allow federal employers, and employers regulated by the federal government, to directedly address underrepresentation issues for Black workers.”
On July 14, 2021 the Government of Canada announced the 13-members task force lead by Professor Adelle Blackett, to conduct the most expansive review of the Act since its inception.

New Hill is an unincorporated community located in southwestern Wake County, North Carolina, United States, at the crossroads of old U.S. 1 (State Road 1011, running northeast–southwest), New Hill Olive Chapel Road (running north) and New Hill Holleman Road (running south). New Hill is located along the original alignment of the New Hope Valley Railway between Durham and Bonsal.
The community is near the southern terminus of the American Tobacco Trail. It is also the location of Duke Energy Progress's Shearon Harris nuclear power plant and the associated Harris Lake recreation center.
A regional wastewater reclamation project has been completed in the area. The project was opposed by local residents who believed that placing the facility in the middle of their community would adversely impact their way of life. A settlement was reached in early 2011 between the towns building the plant and the New Hill community.
The Samuel Bartley Holleman House and New Hill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 2021, New Hill moved to see significant redevelopment and expansion of the city center. This effort was made to encourage additional tax center bases and improve the local ordinances and schools for residents. This charge was led by Brandon Howertitz and shows promise in the aim to bring additional recreational sports to the area, such as mountain biking and frisbee golf.

The 1989–90 season was Colchester United's 48th season in their history and ninth consecutive season in fourth tier of English football, the Fourth Division. Alongside competing in the Fourth Division, the club also participated in the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Associate Members' Cup.
Initially looking to build on manager Jock Wallace's influence towards the end of the 1988–89 season after five consecutive wins and unbeaten in eight, Colchester had a dreadful start to the new campaign, not registering a win until late September and then no further league wins until Boxing Day. By this time, Wallace had stepped aside from their role due to ill health, and after another caretaker spell for Steve Foley, Mick Mills was tasked with keeping Colchester in the Football League. Aside from a four match unbeaten run in February and early March, Mills ultimately failed as the U's finished bottom of the entire Football League and relegated to the Conference.
Only one win was registered in the cups, with a 1–0 FA Cup first round win over Brentford the only highlight prior to elimination by Birmingham City in the second round. Southend United won an Essex derby League Cup first round over two legs, and the U's failed to reach the knockout phase of the Associate Members' Cup.
Season overview
Jock Wallace began their first full season in charge with winless run stretching eight games at the start of the season, and only two league wins were registered before the turn of the decade. Assistant manager Alan Ball left the club to join Stoke City and ahead of Christmas, Wallace stepped aside due to ill health and the onset of Parkinson's disease. Steve Foley was once again placed in temporary charge of the U's first-team, but declined the offer of the role full-time instead preferring their youth team duties. Chairman Jonathan Crisp brought in former Ipswich Town and England defender Mick Mills as new manager having recently been dismissed by Stoke City.
Mills' appointment initially had a positive effect on the team, and they won three and drew one of four league games in late February and early March, but a defeat at nearest rivals Wrexham in late March, after twice leading before succumbing to a 3–2 defeat, summed up the remainder of the season. Despite having enough time to potentially improve their situation, six defeats in the final eight games of the season left Colchester bottom of the Fourth Division and so relegated to the Conference.
By now, the club were over £1m in debt, and plans for a new stadium at Wick Lane, Ardleigh had also been refused. Jonathan Crisp's initial hope of achieving Second Division football within five years of their appointment in 1985 now seemed very distant with the club out of the Football League for the first time in 40 years.

St James' Church is in the village of Great Ormside, Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Appleby, the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with nine other parishes and thirteen places of worship to form the Heart of Eden benefice. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It stands on top of a circular mound overlooking the River Eden.
History
The mound on which the church stands was a sacred site before the coming of Christianity, and was used as a burial place by the Vikings. The date of the first Christian church on the site is unknown, but the nave of the present church dates from the late 11th century. A north aisle was added and the chancel was widened in about the middle of the 12th century. The west tower was built in the following century. In the early 16th century the chancel was further enlarged, making it wider than the nave. The Hilton chapel was built in 1723, replacing the former north aisle. The church was restored in 1885–86 by C. J. Ferguson at a cost of £732 (). During the restoration the north arcade was rebuilt, tracery was installed in the windows of the Hilton Chapel, and a new south doorway and porch were added to the west of the original doorway. In 1893 the tower was re-roofed.
Architecture
Exterior
The church is constructed in sandstone rubble. The roofs are slated on the south side, and covered in stone flags on the north. Its plan consists of a nave with a porch to the south and the Hilton Chapel to the north, a chancel wider than the nave, a north vestry, and a west tower. The nave measures by , and the chancel by . The tower is about square. The basic architectural style is Norman. The tower is in three stages, with large angular buttresses. It is defensive in nature, with no external doorway, three tiers of narrow lancet windows on the west and south sides, and without windows on the north side. The height of the tower has been reduced, with a few corbels of the former parapet remaining. It is surmounted by a pitched roof. On the south side of the church is a gabled porch, to the east of which is the original doorway, now partly blocked and with an inserted window. The original doorway is tall and narrow, with a round-arched head, and a blank tympanum. To the right of this are a round-headed window and a 14th-century two-light mullioned window. In the south wall of the chancel are three windows, with a doorway below the central window. The east window has three lights. The windows in the Hilton Chapel are round-headed.
Interior
Inside the church is a tall, narrow, round-headed doorway leading into the tower, and an upper doorway, the latter being another defensive feature. Inside the tower is a basement and two internal floors. It contains two bells, but only one can be used. Between the nave and the chapel are a two-bay Norman arcade with round arches. In the chapel is a coat of arms dated 1723. In the north wall between the chapel and the chancel are a 14th-century hagioscope. The south wall of the chancel contains a combined aumbry and piscina in two recesses with semicircular heads. The font is Norman, and consists of a square bowl on a 19th-century base.
Churchyard
In 1823 the Ormside bowl was discovered in the churchyard. This is an Anglo-Saxon bowl dating from the 7th or 8th century, and now held in the Yorkshire Museum. A further discovery was made in 1898, this being the burial of a Viking warrior and their sword. The sword is held in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle. In the churchyard is the socket for a cross dated 1643. A new cross was added in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The cross and the socket are listed at Grade II.

Alfred Dodd Starbird (April 28, 1912 – July 28, 1983) was an American modern pentathlete, lieutenant general, and authority on nuclear weaponry. A graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, class of 1933, they were commissioned in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. They were a member of the United States modern pentathlon team at the 1936 Summer Olympics, finishing seventh overall in a field of 42.
During World War II, Starbird served in the Operations Division of the War Department General Staff. They were an observer at landings at Oran and Normandy. In the latter part of the war in Europe, they commanded the 1135th Engineer Combat Group, which supported the assault crossing of the Rhine, and built bridges over the Danube.
From 1955 to 1961, Starbird was Director of Military Applications of the Atomic Energy Commission. They commanded Joint Task Force 8 in the conduct the Operation Dominic series of nuclear tests in 1962, was director of the Defense Communications Agency from 1962 to 1967, and director of the Sentinel program from 1967 to 1971.
After retiring from the Army in 1971, Starbird was director of the newly-created Office of Test and Evaluation in the Department of Defense (DOD) from 1971 to 1975, and assistant administrator for National Security in the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) from 1975 to 1977. In 1977, ERDA became part of the new Department of Energy (DOE), and they became its acting secretary for Defense Programs. They retired in 1980.
Early life and education
Alfred Dodd Starbird was born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, on April 28, 1912, the son of Brigadier General Alfred Andrews Starbird and their wife, Ethel Dodd Starbird, the daughter of Brigadier General George A. Dodd. They had two sisters, Catharine (Kaye) and Ethel. Their family called them by their middle name, Dodd.
On July 1, 1929, Starbird entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Although one of the younger members of their class, they were tall, and distinguished themselves in sports. They were captain of the cross-country running team and also played basketball. They graduated fifth in their class of 347 on June 13, 1933. As was normal for high-ranking graduates, they were commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. They were posted to the 5th Engineer Regiment at Camp Humphreys, Virginia, until February 1, 1935, and then to the 13th Engineer Regiment at Fort Belvoir (as Camp Humphreys had been renamed) until June 15, 1935.
Olympic Games
Starbird, who was promoted to first lieutenant on June 12, 1936, was detached to join the United States modern pentathlon team at the 1936 Summer Olympics. They finished equal seventh in the cross-country running, equal eighth in the fencing and show jumping, 20th in the swimming and 23rd in the shooting, and finished seventh overall in a field of 42. Although the United States team was placed first, they did not receive a gold medal, as medals were not awarded to modern pentathlon teams until 1952. Returning to the United States on August 23, 1933, Starbird entered Princeton University, from which they received a Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering on July 1, 1937.
After attending the officers' course at the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir, they returned to West Point as an instructor in Civil and Military Engineering on June 5, 1938. They married Evelyn Wallington at Fort Meyer, Virginia, where their father was stationed, in June 1939. They had three children: Edward, Susan and Catharine.
World War II
During World War II, Starbird was promoted to captain in the Army of the United States on September 9, 1940, and major on February 1, 1942. On May 22, 1942, they were posted to the Operations Division of the War Department General Staff, the U.S. Army's global command post, working in its European section.
For Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, they were attached to the staff of the 1st Infantry Division as the War Department observer from October 20 to November 23, 1942 for its landing at Oran. They were promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States on November 28, 1942, and captain in the Corps of Engineers on June 13, 1943. They represented the Operations Division at the Quebec Conference in August 1943 as an expert on the European Theater of Operations.
During Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, they were again a War Department observer, this time with V Corps headquarters from May 20 to June 13, 1944. For this service they were awarded the bronze star. Returning to the Operations Division, they were promoted to colonel in the Army of the United States on December 16, 1944. For their services with the Operations Division, they were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.
On January 1, 1945, Starbird assumed command of the 1135th Engineer Combat Group. The 1135th Engineer Combat Group supported the XII Corps assault crossing of the Rhine River on March 22 and 23, 1945. For this operation 18 engineer units were attached to 1135th Engineer Combat Group, and Starbird had the services of 600 storm boats and 300 assault boats. The 1135th Engineer Combat Group built a pontoon bridge over the Danube River on May 4 and then a treadway bridge on May 6. Starbird was awarded the Legion of Merit and second bronze star. They returned to the Operation Division on June 1, 1945.
Nuclear weapons
On July 17, 1946, Starbird was posted to Hawaii as the deputy chief of staff of United States Army Pacific. They were then seconded to Joint Task Force 7, a special force formed for the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific in 1948. Their appointment as a colonel in the Army of the United States was terminated on June 30, 1947, and they reverted to their permanent rank of captain. They were promoted to major in the Corps of Engineers on July 15, 1948. On April 1, 1949, they returned to Washington, D.C., where they worked for a year with the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group.
Starbird joined the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Paris when it was formed in 1951. They then returned to Washington, D.C., for a two-year tour in the Office of the Chief of Engineers. They were promoted to brigadier general in 1955. From 1955 to 1961, they were Director of Military Applications of the Atomic Energy Commission. At this time, great technical progress was being made in nuclear weapons technology, and atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs were coming into service in large numbers. They wrote voluminous reports on complex, technical issues. They advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear disarmament issues, and a proposed moratorium on nuclear testing, and warned the Commission about the amount of fallout that could be expected from the Operation Hardtack I nuclear tests, and recommended the use of underground nuclear weapons testing.
In 1961, Starbird returned to duty with the Corps of Engineers as chief engineer of the North Pacific Division, supervising large military and civil construction projects in Portland, Oregon. In December 1961, they were suddenly ordered to take command of Joint Task Force 8 and conduct the Operation Dominic series of nuclear tests. For this, they were awarded an oak leaf cluster to their Distinguished Service Medal. Their citation read:
Starbird served as director of the Defense Communications Agency from 1962 to 1967. On June 15, 1966, they were designated commander of Joint Task Force 728, and made directly responsible to the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. Starbird was given until September 1967 to build the McNamara Line, an electronic surveillance system intended to detect infiltration of South Vietnam by NVA forces from North Vietnam and Laos. The project was given the highest national priority, and Starbird was sent to South Vietnam to confer with General William Westmoreland. Considered by its critics to be symbolic of McNamara's management, in that it was expensive, valued technology over experience, and was generally ineffective, the barrier was never completed, and by March 1969 was shelved. Starbird received a second oak leaf cluster to their Distinguished Service Medal for this work. Their final assignment was as director of the Sentinel program, an anti-ballistic missile system. They retired from the military in 1971. They were awarded a third oak leaf cluster to their Distinguished Service Medal, and an oak leaf cluster to their Legion of Merit.
In 1971, Starbird became director of the newly-created Office of Test and Evaluation in the Department of Defense (DOD). In 1975, they were appointed the assistant administrator for National Security in the ERDA, the successor to the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1977, ERDA became part of the new Department of Energy (DOE), and they became its acting secretary for Defense Programs. They retired, only to be recalled to become director of the Joint DOD/DOE Long Range Resource Planning Group. They finally retired in 1980. As a civilian, they received an Atomic Energy Commission citation and Gold Medal for Commendatory Service in 1970, the Secretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award in 1975 and the ERDA Citation in 1977.
Starbird died of cancer at Walter Reed Hospital on July 28, 1983. Their son Edward graduated with West Point class of 1962, and rose to become a colonel in the Corps of Engineers. Edward married Margaret Leonard, the daughter of Starbird's 1936 modern pentathlon teammate Charles F. Leonard Jr. Their son, Starbird's grandson, Charles D. Starbird graduated with the class of 1990, and granddaughter Kate Starbird is a former professional basketball player in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the American Basketball League (ABL), and a faculty member at the University of Washington.

Lisa Sousa (born 1962) is an American academic historian active in the field of Latin American studies. A specialist in the colonial-era history of Latin America and of Colonial Mexico in particular, Sousa is noted for their research, commentary, and translations of colonial Mesoamerican literature and Nahuatl-language historical texts. They have also published research on historical and contemporary indigenous peoples in Mexico, the roles of women in indigenous societies and cultural definitions of gender. Sousa is a full professor in the History Department at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California.
Studies and career
Lisa Sousa was born 1962 in Sebastopol, California. They attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an undergraduate, completing a B.A. in Latin American studies in 1990. Them postgraduate studies in Latin American history were also undertaken at UCLA, where their research focused on the history and experience of women and indigenous cultures in colonial-era Mexico.
Sousa first completed their Master's degree in 1992 before entering the doctorate studies program, and was awarded their PhD in 1998. Them doctoral dissertation, "Women in Native Societies and Cultures of Colonial Mexico", won UCLA's Mary Wollstonecraft Dissertation Award for the best thesis in Women's studies.
As their PhD was being completed, Sousa obtained a position as adjunct professor at Occidental College in the 1997–98 academic year. After a brief term as a visiting lecturer at UCLA, Sousa took up an assistant professorship at Occidental, from 1998 onwards. In addition to their continuing research and publications in the field, Sousa teaches a number of related courses in Latin American history, Mesoamerican literature and gender studies, and also provides instruction in learning Nahuatl.
At Occidental, Sousa was awarded the prestigious Graham L. Sterling Memorial Award, established in 1972 to recognize a faculty member with a distinguished record of teaching, service and professional achievement.
Research
During the course of their studies at UCLA Sousa obtained a proficiency in Classical Nahuatl, an indigenous language of the central Mexican altiplano and lingua franca of the Aztec Empire at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.
While studying at UCLA in the 1990s Sousa researched and published papers on a theme relating to women and gender among indigenous cultures in Mexico. Themes analysed by Sousa include rationalisation of and attitudes to violence against women, the representation and participation of women in crime and colonial-era rebellion, and slavery of indigenous groups in the New World. Them publications and seminars also explore the nature of gender roles in Mesoamerican cultures, particularly among Nahua, Mixtec and Zapotec peoples of the pre- and post-conquest eras.
In 1998 as their PhD was being completed, Sousa co-edited and translated an English-language edition of the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, a 17th-century Nahuatl-language manuscript that is central to the claims of the Guadalupan apparition to Juan Diego. The book, The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's Huei tlamahuiçoltica of 1649, jointly published by Stanford University Press and UCLA's Latin American Center, also contains analysis of and translated excerpts from the 1648 document, Imagen de la Virgen María, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe by Miguel Sánchez. Together with their collaborators Stafford Poole and James Lockhart, Sousa affirms that Luis Laso de la Vega was indeed the principal author of the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, and that portions of the work bear affinities with Sánchez's document. They regard Sánchez's Imagen de la Virgen María as the earliest known written account of the Guadalupan apparition, and that consequently these two mid-17th-century texts are the principal origins of the apparition story, and not any earlier source or tradition contemporaneous with the events purported to have taken place more than a century before those documents were written.
In 2004, Sousa and UCLA professor Kevin Terraciano were presented with the Robert F. Heizer Article Award by the American Society for Ethnohistory, for their co-authored paper "The 'Original Conquest' of Oaxaca: Nahua and Mixtec Accounts of the Spanish Conquest", published the preceding year in the journal Ethnohistory.
In 2005 Sousa co-edited with Matthew Restall and Terraciano a volume of translated colonial-era Nahuatl-, Mayan- and Mixtec-language primary source texts, under the title Mesoamerican Voices: Native-Language Writings from Colonial Mexico and Guatemala.
In 2017, Sousa published a book, The Woman Who Turned Into a Jaguar, and Other Narratives of Native Women in Archives of Colonial Mexico (Stanford University Press). The book is a social and cultural history of gender relations among indigenous peoples of New Spain, focusing on four native groups in highland Mexico―the Nahua, Mixtec, Zapotec, and Mixe―tracing cross-cultural similarities and differences in the roles and status attributed to women in prehispanic and colonial Mesoamerica. The book won wide praise among reviewers and was awarded both the American Historical Associations 2018 Friedrich Katz Prize in Latin American and Caribbean History and the American Society for Ethnohistory's Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin Prize for the year's best book of ethnohistory.
In the 2017-2018 academic year, Sousa was selected as one of 40 Getty Center Scholars-in-Residence for 2017-18. The academics and artists will work on a range of topics at the Getty Center on the theme of "Iconoclasm and Vandalism."

The Habit of Fire is a 2007 album by Indonesian avant-garde metal band Kekal. Released on 15 May in North America, Japan & Australia and 15 March in Europe & South America, it is their sixth full-length album. The album was constructed during Jeff's move to Canada, and was the last album recorded in their home studio in Indonesia. There is an official music video for the song "Isolated I".
Concept
In an interview with Ultimate Metal.com, Jeff said that "The Habit of Fire is a concept album about the living energy in a human being that has become our archetype of survival... ...The fire itself represents an energy or spirit that can never be taken down by outside forces. The lyrical themes are based around a 12-million people metropolis within a post-dictatorship country, heading down into chaos due to the people's inability to adapt with the global winds of change."
Recording
In the same interview, Jeff said that the recording process was only the second album that the band did not have a single problem in the recording process. About 75% of the music was written during pre-production. Jeff would collect samples and create MIDI information, and manipulate the sounds to create the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI instruments, synthesizers, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals. Overall, it took over seven months to complete.
Reception and style
The Habit of Fire met with a mixed reception by critics. It was praised for its diverse style and instrumentation as well as its quality musicianship, but was considered repetitive and over-indulgent at times, as well as somewhat inaccessible and difficult to digest. The album was nominated for The Best Avantgarde Metal Album award by the popular metal website Metal Storm, and in November 2007, the album was chosen as the CD of the Month by UK's music technology magazine Sound on Sound.
On this release, the band reduced its black metal sound to make room for atmospheric soundscapes and industrial textures. The music is varied, combining the band's metal roots with styles such as progressive rock, electronica, psychedelic ambient, and jazz fusion, giving the album a "breathless, almost ADD" feel. The experimental aspects of the album were likened to Tool, while the progressive elements were compared to Marillion and the heavier passages to Mortal. PopMatters described the album as "flipping randomly between radio stations playing Rush, King Crimson, Ulver, and the Mars Volta".

The Bréguet 17 was a two-seat biplane fighter developed in France towards the end of World War I and operated by that country during the 1920s.
Design and development
The Bréguet 17 was a derivative of the highly successful 14 bombers, but somewhat scaled down and carrying a more powerful engine and heavier machine gun armament in place of a bomb load. The French Army was impressed enough to place orders for 1,000 of these aircraft during 1918, to be delivered the following year. The end of World War I ended these plans, but some limited production did take place into the early 1920s.
Operational history
The type was operated as the Bre.17C.2 with several escadrilles as a supplement to existing aircraft, but never formed the basis for any one unit on its own. A single example was converted into a prototype night fighter, but no production ensued.

Raúl Azcárraga Vidaurreta was a Mexican business person and broadcasting pioneer.
In February 1923, they started transmitting trial radio signals from their business office located in Avenida Juárez, in Mexico City, using a 50-watt transmitter. After the success of the transmissions Azcárraga and Mexico City's newspaper El Universal made an agreement to operate jointly the radio station.
On 8 May 1923, the newspaper issued the following statement: "As the big American newspapers do, El Universal is now using a powerful radio station to broadcast its news. It is located in the heart of the [Mexican] Republic." The inaugural broadcast was transmitted that same day.
This venture would provide the capital for the radio station that would shape Mexican communications for years to come, XEW, started in 1930. It was initially owned by Raúl Azcárraga Vidaurreta but later passed on to their brother Emilio who would in time set their own broadcasting legacy by starting Televisa.

StanFlex (also known as STANFLEX or Standard Flex) is a modular mission payload system used by the Royal Danish Navy. Originally conceived during the 1980s as a way of replacing several classes of minor war vessel with a single class of multi-role ships (the ), the StanFlex system consists of weapons and equipment mounted in standardised containers, which can be loaded into slots on the ships. These containers can be swapped out in a short period of time, allowing the ship to switch between roles when needed. The success of the modular payload system led the Royal Danish Navy to design all new warships with StanFlex slots, and to install slots on older vessels during major refits. By 2012, nine ship classes capable of carrying StanFlex payloads were in service.
Development
During the early 1980s, the Royal Danish Navy (RDN) required replacements for three classes of minor war vessel, but could not afford to replace all 22 ships on a one-for-one basis. Instead of building dedicated replacements for each role, the RDN came up with the idea for a single vessel design which could be modified to assume a particular role when needed. Equipment common to all roles would be built into the ship, while mission specific payloads would be built into modules, which could be fitted into standardised slots aboard the ship when needed. This modular payload system came to be known as "Standard Flex", or "StanFlex" for short.
Feasibility studies during 1983 and 1984 led to the design of the Standard Flex 300 vessel (later named the ); 16 of which could replace the 22 previous vessels. These were long, 320-ton patrol vessels, fitted with one Standard Flex slot forward and three aft. The modules themselves were designed by the Naval Material Command and Promecon A/S. Construction commenced in July 1985, with 14 vessels (2 having been cancelled in 1993) commissioned by mid-1996. As other warship types were replaced, the new vessels were designed to carry StanFlex modules.
Module design and use
Stanflex modules are constructed by Monberg & Thorsen. Each module is housed in a stainless steel container measuring in length, in width, and in height. Precision-machined flanges ensure that the module accurately mates up with connections for power, ventilation, communications, water, and data. The weapon or system is mounted on the roof of the module, while the machinery, electronics, and supporting equipment are housed within.
Modules are usually installed and replaced by a 15-ton capacity mobile crane. A module can be swapped out and replaced within half an hour, and after system testing completed, the ship is ready to deploy within a few hours. However, refresher training for the ship's crew will take significantly longer. Standardised consoles are fitted in the combat information centre: the console's role is defined by the software installed, which can be quickly replaced. The ease of installation and use is compared by naval personnel to another Danish product: Lego.
Benefits and drawbacks
Unused modules can be stored in controlled conditions, reducing the need for preventative maintenance.
Ships do not need to be taken out of service when equipment requires maintenance, and vice versa.
New weapons and systems can be installed on the vessels by fitting them to a module, instead of refitting the entire ship.
When a ship or class is removed from service, the modules can be reused by other vessels. Similarly, as they do not have to be built into the ship, modular weapons and systems do not have to be factored into the purchase cost of a new vessel: in 2006, a proposed 6,000-ton frigate design for the KDM was predicted to cost DKK 1.6 billion per ship (USD ), while similar projects in other European nations were slated to cost between DKK 2.6 billion and DKK 6.3 billion (USD to ).
The multi-role ships are slightly less efficient than a dedicated ship in a particular role, but the ability to be quickly reequipped for other roles more than makes up for this.
Inventory
As of 2001, the KDM inventory of StanFlex modules included:
By 2006, there were 101 units of 11 types.
Ships with StanFlex
, nine ship classes were capable of using StanFlex modules.
Flyvefisken-class patrol vessel
1 slot forward, 3 slots aft.
patrol vessel
1 slot aft. Diana-class ships normally operate with a storage or anti-pollution module fitted. Because of the position of the RHIB dock, they cannot embark the variable depth sonar module (which is normally deployed over the stern). The Diana class can be used to transport, but not operate, all other modules.
command ship
5 slots on weapons deck. Because of the weapons deck's position, only missile-firing, SIGINT/ELINT and storage modules can be used.
corvette
2 slots aft. Unlike other classes, the Niels Juel-class corvettes were modified for StanFlex during their mid-life modernisation. This class was scrapped in 2013.

Chiba () is a Chinese vertical end-blown flute and one type of xiao. It is one of the oldest Chinese woodwind instruments. Unlike the northern xiao, it bears resemblance to most of the southern xiao, in that it is shorter, wider, has an open mouthpiece, slightly conical, and generally has a root end.
Of the three main types of southern xiao (known as nanxiao) it is the one that most closely resembles the Japanese shakuhachi (also ). Most nanxiao (and northern beixiao) have a "notched" mouthpiece that is either U-shaped (Cantonese style) or V-shaped (Fujianese style), whereas the chiba has an angled edge instead, giving it a far breathier sound, like that of the shakuhachi. A possible distinction between shakuhachi and chiba is that most modern shakuhachi have an ivory inlay in the mouthpiece, whereas the chiba does not. Shakuhachi also typically only have five large finger holes (four in front and thumb), whereas chiba may have from five to eight finger holes, emulating the design of other Chinese xiao.

Coming of Age (CoA, COA) is a Unitarian Universalist program in which a congregation fosters the transition of its children into youth. Although COA programs vary by congregation, they typically mark the individual's transition from younger religious education programs into a youth group, District-level/Regional Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU), as well as National and Continental-level YRUU. Not all youth will enter into all of the levels of programming above, though entering into at least congregational-level YRUU (Youth group) is very common. At least one of the UUA districts holds a series of COA retreats to supplement congregational COA programs.
In most programs, a congregation's youth (usually aged 12 and above) are paired with adult mentors who are members of the congregation. Many programs ask youth to investigate their personal spirituality with the support of their mentors. Youth participants in the program are encouraged to develop a greater sense of what they believe. They do this through discussion, listening to guest speakers, and participating in retreats and workshops. Workshops may be designed to prompt the youth, challenge their modes of thinking, or aid them in furthering their ideas. Some congregations have also encouraged or required each child and mentor to do a social action or social service project together, or organized a service project which all participating youth and mentors do together, such as cooking and serving food at a soup kitchen.
At the end of many COA programs, youth and their mentors prepare a service in which they present "faith statements" or "credo statements" — written statements of belief and perspectives developed over the course of program. These statements vary in many ways, because there are few "guidelines" as to what youth may say. Typically, participants who do not wish to present a credo statement may communicate their findings in other ways; for example a choreographed dance or a musical piece they have written. Services vary from church to church and can involve almost anything that the participants want it to. Favorite hymns, dances, songs, and readings may be included.
For the most part, children identify with the faith beliefs of their parents and family. The Coming of Age program signals the beginning of individual spiritual searching; it is an official recognition that the youth involved have begun to search for personal truth.

Ella May Saison (also credited as Ella Mae Saison) is a Filipino singer referred as the original Philippine Queen of Soul.
Career
Saison began their recording career at age 19. Prior to landing a recording contract, they were a soloist for the Artstart Band, specializing in jazz, gospel, and blues. In the Philippines, they are best known for their hits "Till My Heartaches End" written by Vehnee Saturno and "If The Feeling Is Gone", subsequently covered by Passage and Kyla, respectively. Saison won the Katha Award for Best Female Performer for the song "If the feeling is gone written by Jimmy Borja, and they were also recognized in the Philippines for one Gold and one Platinum album.
A year after their second album release, they signed a recording deal with Evander Holyfield's independent record label, Kats Eye, and released So In Love in 1997. The songs "So In Love" and "Never Had A Chance" were released as singles. Andrew Rollins and Don Williams were producers, songwriters and musicians on the album except for "Never Had A Chance" which was co-written by Judith Jordan, Ronnie Hammon and Rollins. Jerry Brown was the engineer. The album was recorded at A&M Studios. Humberto Gatica was also an engineer.
In addition to working with Humberto Gatica (producer of Celine Dion), they have worked with Gerry Brown (producer of Vanessa Williams) and artists such as The Eagles and IV Xample. Timothy B. Schmit of The Eagles contributed background vocals to the So In Love album, as did Eagle contemporary John David Souther.
There has been a degree of controversy associated with the credits to So In Love. It is contended that Saison specifically worked with Bryant Woodert (PKA Lucius) of IV Xample, who produced their vocals for the title song to the album. This song, written by Don H. Williams and Andrew Rollins, went on to win an award in the Philippines for best vocal production. Bryant Woodert never received any credit for doing vocal production, though they are listed as a background singer on the album credits (under Lucius of IV Xample). Though Gerry Brown was the engineer for this session, it is contended that they did not participate in any vocal direction, even though they and Andrew Rollins were given the credit for this. Andrew Rollins, who was said to be in New York at the time of the recording, later received the Philippine award for best vocal production.
Saison released a single with CeCe Peniston entitled "Reminiscin", which made the Billboard Charts under the "Powerpick Club Play" category, hitting number 30. Peniston's opinion of Saison is as follows: "(In) January 2001, we collaborated on a duet titled "Reminiscin" that charted on 'Billboard's Club Playlist'. I was fortunate to witness the warmth of a beautiful personality and the great talent of a rising star. I hope the world will be allowed to share in this experience too." Saison also performed at the Awards Dinner of the Republic of South Africa and the African Times in honor of President Nelson Mandela. They have recently sung the "Star Spangled Banner" at the Countrywide Classic/ATP US Open Series at UCLA last July 17, 2007.
In the early 2000s, their focus became more regional than national, when they joined Los Angeles-based covers band Dark Sunday, as lead singer, where they were well received.
They returned to the Philippines in 2005, to great acclaim, but then left again for California in the United States where they continue their career.
In July 2011, Saison performed "Till My Heartaches End" on Party Pilipinas.

Big South Cape Island or Taukihepa is an offshore island of New Zealand to the west of the southern tip of Stewart Island / Rakiura. The island has no permanent inhabitants but muttonbirders visit the island to catch the sooty shearwater, known in New Zealand as a "muttonbird".
Māori named the island "Taukihepa" and Europeans, who arrived later, called it "Big South Cape". The island was given dual names in 2001 as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement with Ngāi Tahu.
The island is the largest of a group of islands off the southwestern coast of Stewart Island / Rakiura, from which it is separated by a wide channel. Surrounding smaller islands include Poutama Island to the south, Putauhina Island and the Putauhina Nuggets to the northwest, and Solomon Island to the north. The island rises to a height of at its centre, and numerous small streams run to the coast. Named features on the island include two inlets – Murderers Cove in the central east coast and Puwai Bay in the island's southwest. It has an area of about .
Rat invasion
Maori muttonbirders had traditionally visited the island each summer to hunt sooty shearwaters (muttonbirds) that came to nest on the island in the spring. In March 1964, muttonbirders arrived to find the island had been devastated by the effect of rats that were causing one of New Zealand's greatest ecological disasters of the twentieth century. Previously free of mammalian predators, the ecology of the island was devastated in a matter of years and many endemic species of bird (some flightless) were driven to extinction. The surviving biomass of insect and bird life has been heavily reduced. An eradication programme was initiated to rid the island of rats and the island was rat-free again in 2006.
Animals that became extinct
Despite intervention by the New Zealand Wildlife Service that trapped and transferred some surviving birds to other, rat free, off-shore islands, two species of bird did not survive and became extinct. These were Stead's bush wren and the South Island snipe. The New Zealand greater short-tailed bat also became extinct.

Asa Fowler (February 23, 1811 – April 26, 1885) was a New Hampshire politician, lawyer and jurist. They served as a justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court from August 1, 1855, until February 1, 1861, and in the New Hampshire House of Representatives 1845, 1847, 1848 and 1871 to 1872. In 1872 they were Speaker of the House. During all other years in the House, they served on the judiciary committee. They were nominated for governor of New Hampshire by the Free Soil Party in 1855.
They were born in Pembroke, New Hampshire, to Benjamin and Mehitable (Ladd) Fowler on February 23, 1811. From an early age, they were put to work on the family farm along with their ten siblings, but Asa contracted typhoid fever when they were fourteen and was thereafter unable to do anything other than light farm work. This proved to be a blessing in disguise because Asa was allowed to return to the education that they and their brothers and sisters had abandoned in order to work on the farm. After attending Blanchard Academy in Pembroke on a part-time basis (he still had to do light work on the farm), Asa was admitted as a sophomore to Dartmouth College where they were Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1833. After briefly working as a schoolmaster in Topsfield, Massachusetts, Fowler went to work for James Sullivan, Esq. in Pembroke where they began the study of law. In 1834, they moved to Concord, New Hampshire, where they continued to study law in the office of Charles H. Peaslee. At the same time, they worked as a freelance journalist and co-edited a literary gazette. In 1835, Fowler was elected clerk of the New Hampshire State Senate, which office they held for five years.
Admitted to the bar in February 1837, Fowler was in practice by themselves until September 1838 when they formed a partnership with Franklin Pierce, the future president of the United States. This partnership continued until April 1845. Other legal colleagues included John Y. Mugridge from 1854 to 1855 and William E. Chandler from 1861 to 1864. Fowler retired from the practice of law in 1877.
They were a U.S. Commissioner for the State of New Hampshire from 1846 until their death; in February 1861, they were a delegate to the Peace Congress held in Washington, D.C., which sought in vain to prevent the American Civil War; and they were the solicitor of Merrimack County, New Hampshire, from 1861 to 1865. Following their departure from the last office, they served on a three-man commission charged with the revision of New Hampshire's laws, and they shepherded through the legislature the resulting general statutes, which were approved in 1867. In their community, Fowler took a keen interest in public libraries and schools, and they served on the Board of Education in Concord.
Fowler also served as director of a railroad and two banks, additionally serving as president of the railroad and one of the banks.  They are said to have resigned as president and director of the First National Bank when "he lost confidence in the cashier".
On July 13, 1837, Fowler married Mary Dole Cilley Knox (1815–1882). They had five children—four sons and a daughter—between 1842 and 1853. All five lived at least to adulthood.
From 1878 until their death, Fowler enjoyed extensive travel despite bouts of ill health and the deaths of their wife, a daughter-in-law, and grandson within less than two years. They spent the summer of 1878 in western Europe with their wife; daughter, Clara; and son, William. (His youngest son, Edward “Ned” Cilley Fowler, appears to have become estranged from the family.) After the death of their wife, they seem to have travelled alone, spending several months in Florida before returning to Europe for a last visit. In 1884, they travelled to California, visiting Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco. Asa Fowler died in San Rafael, California April 26, 1885. Their embalmed body was shipped home and buried in New Hampshire on May 9, 1885.
Fowler's religious affiliation was Unitarian, and they were active in that church. Their political affiliations were, perhaps, emblematic of their times. Their family of origin had belonged to the Democratic Party, but their opposition to slavery led them to abandon the party for nearly thirty years. From 1846 to 1856, they belonged to the Free Soil Party which was largely made up of ex-Democrats and was also called the Independent Democratic Party. Fowler ran for a seat in Congress from the second district of New Hampshire in 1851 on the Free Soil Party ticket but came in third in a three-way race. In 1856, they became a Republican and remained one until 1875, near the end of Reconstruction, when they once again became a Democrat.

The 33rd Scripps National Spelling Bee was held at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, District of Columbia on June 8–9, 1960, by the E.W. Scripps Company.
The winner was Henry Feldman (age 13) of Oak Ridge, Tennessee and sponsored by the Knoxville News Sentinel, correctly spelling the word "eudaemonic". It was Feldman's third time in the competition; they had placed 20th the prior year. Second place went to Betty Jean Altschul of Norfolk, Virginia, who had misspelled "velleity". Altschul was also the shortest competitor, at 4 foot 6 inches, and stood on a dictionary in the final round to use the microphone.
The competition had 73 entrants, 48 girls and 25 boys. Twenty-four (16 girls and 8 boys) advanced past the first day of spelling into the finals. Benson Alleman, an English professor from Kentucky, was the pronouncer, for the 13th and final time, as they died before the next year's competition.

Francesco Monti (il Brescianino) (1646–1703) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque period, mainly active in their natal city of Brescia, as well as Parma.
They were a pupil of Pietro Ricchi (also known as il Lucchese), then of Jacques Courtois (also known as il Borgognone), who was well known as a battle painter. This association led Monti themselves to be called Francesco della Battaglia. For many years before 1700, they worked for the ruling family of Parma. They painted the Blessed Virgin in Adoration of Christ in the Manger for the church of Santa Maria Calcherà in Parma. There are at least three Italian painters that gained the nickname Brescianino.

The Open Book Festival is an annual literary festival held in Cape Town, South Africa with a focus on South African literature in an international context. The event includes over 150 literary events, featuring over 100 authors over 5 days. Although South African literature features prominently literature from across the world is also featured with both Anglophone and Francophone authors featuring prominently in the festivals events.
Main venue of the event is located at the Fugard Theatre but also includes other nearby venues in Cape Town such as The District 6 Museum, The Homecoming Centre, the Townhouse Hotel, The Slave Lodge, The Museum, The National Gallery, Central Library and Lobby Books.
History
The first Open Book festival was held in 2011. The event was initiated by Mervyn Sloman of The Book Lounge (a Cape Town-based bookshop) and Ben Williams of Books Live (a literary focused subsidiary of the South African newspaper Times Live).
Focuses of interest
The festival was founded to bring the best literature in the world to Cape Town; to promote South African writing on an internationally; and to make books and literature more accessible to young readers. The event is noted for being more representative and drawing a wider range of authors than other South African book festivals.
Most of the 150 events fall into one of the following sub-events with particular focuses:
Poetica: a two-day-long programme of events focused on poetry.
Comic Book Fest: focus on comic books and graphic novels.
Authors: number of panel discussions, workshops, presentations, and other events focused on authors.
Youth Programme: a number of events that focuses on encouraging a love for books amongst young people.
Notable events
In 2013 the Open Book Festival broke the Guinness Book of World Records for the world's longest book chain consisting of 2586 books.

Harry Graham (16 December 1887 – 1940) was a Scottish professional footballer who played in the Scottish Football League for Raith Rovers and Heart of Midlothian, and in the Football League for Bradford City, Birmingham, Leicester City and Reading. They played as an inside forward.
Career
Graham was born in Edinburgh. They began their career in the Junior grade and was selected twice for Scotland at that level in 1908. They also played for St Bernard's before moving to England to sign for Bradford City in April 1910. They played 11 First Division games without scoring, and in October 1911 joined Second Division club Birmingham. Graham played 12 times for Birmingham, scoring four goals, but they were principally a playmaker, and the club's need was for a goalscorer. In September 1912 they returned to Scotland and signed for Raith Rovers, for whom they appeared in the 1913 Scottish Cup Final.
Graham moved on at the end of the season to Heart of Midlothian, who were looking for a replacement for the recently retired Bobby Walker. Before and during the First World War, Graham scored 41 goals from 120 appearances in the Scottish League, and the League rewarded them with selection for a representative match against the Southern League in October 1914. A qualified dentist, Graham was turned down for "McCrae's Battalion" in 1914 because of asthma, but during the 1916–17 season they were conscripted into the Army, and served with the Royal Army Medical Corps and as a private with the Gloucestershire Regiment. On their return to Hearts, they struggled to get into the first team, and in December 1920 they returned to England and joined Leicester City.
Despite their age – it was around the time of their 33rd birthday when they joined the club – Graham played more than 100 games for Leicester in the Second Division, which they followed with six months with former club St Bernard's and another return to England, where they contributed to Reading's championship of the Third Division South in the 1925–26 season.

High Vacuum is a science fiction novel by Charles Eric Maine. It was first published in 1957 by Hodder & Stoughton.
Synopsis
The first crewed Moon ship, Alpha, runs out of fuel just before landing in the Mare Imbrium and crashes, killing one of the four-person crew and marooning the rest. The novel follows the castaways as they struggle to survive and return to Earth.
Critical reception
In the June 1958 issue of Science Fiction Stories, Damon Knight wrote,
"Maine's style is stiff and pompous, but it moves the story along purposefully; their characters are oversimplified but vivid and forceful at times...The only thing really wrong with the book, in fact, is the science in it. Maine's physics is bad, their chemistry worse...The gross errors in this novel are in the area of common knowledge (as if a Western hero should saddle up a pueblo and ride off down the cojone): any one of them could have been corrected by ten minutes with a dictionary or an encyclopedia."

NGC 1192 is a lenticular galaxy approximately 417 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Eridanus. It was discovered by American astronomer Francis Leavenworth on December 2, 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.
Together with NGC 1189, NGC 1190, NGC 1191 and NGC 1199 it forms Hickson Compact Group 22 (HCG 22) galaxy group. Although they are considered members of this group, NGC 1191 and NGC 1192 are in fact background objects, since they are much further away compared to the other members of this group.

Dipper is an Indian condom brand marketed by Tata Motors and Rediffusion Y&R to promote safe sex among truck drivers in India. Manufactured by HLL Lifecare, it is part of an award-winning AIDS awareness campaign that was initiated by Tata. The name, "Dipper", was inspired by the iconic message, "Use Dipper at Night" (meaning the recommended usage of dim headlights at night) - that are painted at the back of inter- as well as intrastate trucks in India.
History
It was a NACO idea, created in 2005.
According to studies carried out by the Transport Corporation of India (TCI), out of the two million truck drivers in India who visit sex workers, only about 11 percent of them use protection. It also found that AIDS awareness among the drivers was very low, with about 16 percent of them suffering from some venereal disease.
In April 2016, Tata Motors, one of India's largest truck manufacturers, launched a campaign called "Use Dipper at Night" which was intended to resonate amongst truck drivers who are clueless about unsafe sex and its consequences. In association with creative agency Rediffusion Y&R, latex condom manufacturer HLL Lifecare, and TCI, Tata launched "Khushi Clinics" which carried out distribution of condoms in and around prime locations of truck drivers such as Ludhiana (Punjab), Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), and Vashi (Maharashtra).
Production
Dipper condoms are manufactured by Hindustan Latex Limited (HLL) Lifecare. For packaging, Rediffusion employed a colourful artwork style used by truck drivers and owners to decorate their trucks, in order to make them appealing to its targeted user base. Called 'truck art' in creative parlance, colourful patterns and pictures that reflected 'highway culture' was used while creating the packets.
In April 2016, a total of 45,000 Dipper condoms were sold by the TCI Foundation in a window of 30 days. Birender Dubey, coordinator of the activity in Vashi, said, "The response was great. Normally, truckers feel shy about buying condoms. But Dipper appealed to their sensibilities. Everything worked in its favour - the price, the packaging, the quality, and most of all, the message 'Use Dipper At Night.' The stock is sold out and we've been getting request for more from drivers and our other clinics ever since."
Honors
In June 2016, Rediffusion Y&R won a Silver Medal Lion for the campaign in the 2016 edition of Media Lions.

In enzymology, a proline racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
L-proline D-proline
Hence, this enzyme has two substrates, L- and D-proline, and two products, D- and L- proline.
This enzyme belongs to the family of proline racemases acting on free amino acids. The systematic name of this enzyme class is proline racemase. This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism. These enzymes catalyse the interconversion of L- and D-proline in bacteria.
Species distribution
This first eukaryotic proline racemase was identified in Trypanosoma cruzi and fully characterized . The parasite enzyme, TcPRAC, is as a co-factor-independent proline racemase and displays B-cell mitogenic properties when released by T. cruzi upon infection, contributing to parasite escape.
Novel proline racemases of medical and veterinary importance were described respectively in Clostridium difficile () and Trypanosoma vivax (). These studies showed that a peptide motif used as a minimal pattern signature to identify putative proline racemases (motif III*) is insufficient stringent per se to discriminate proline racemases from 4-hydroxyproline epimerases (HyPRE). Also, additional, non-dissociated elements that account for the discrimination of these enzymes were identified, based for instance on polarity constraints imposed by specific residues of the catalytic pockets. Based on those elements, enzymes incorrectly described as proline racemases were biochemically proved to be hydroxyproline epimerases (i.e. HyPREs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Q9I476), Burkholderia pseudomallei (), Brucella abortus (), Brucella suis () and Brucella melitensis ().
Structural studies
The biochemical mechanism of proline racemase was first put forward in the late sixties by Cardinale and Abeles using the Clostridium sticklandii enzyme, CsPRAC. The catalytic mechanism of proline racemase was late revisited by Buschiazzo, Goytia and collaborators that, in 2006, resolved the structure of the parasite TcPRAC co-crystallyzed with its known competitive inhibitor - pyrrole carboxylic acid (PYC). Those studies showed that each active enzyme contains two catalytic pockets. Isothermal titration calorimetry then showed that two molecules of PYC associate with TcPRAC in solution, and that this association is time-dependent and most probably based on mechanism of negative cooperativity. Complementary biochemical findings are consistent with the presence of two active catalytic sites per homodimer, each pertaining to one enzyme subunit, challenging the previously proposed mechanism of one catalytic site per homodimer previously proposed.
Mechanism
The proline racemase active site contains two general bases, each of them a Cys, located on either side of the alpha-carbon of the substrate. In order to work properly, one Cys must be protonated (a thiol, RSH) and the other must be deprotonated (a thiolate, RS–).
Inhibition
Proline racemase is inhibited by pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, a transition state analogue that is flat like the transition state.

Meum athamanticum is a glabrous, highly aromatic (aroma compound), perennial plant – the only species (monotypic) in the genus Meum of the family Apiaceae. Common names in the UK include baldmoney, meu or meum, and spignel (also spikenel and spiknel).
It is a plant of grassland, often on limestone, in mountain districts of Western Europe and Central Europe, its range extending as far south as the Sierra Nevada (Spain) of Andalucia, and central Bulgaria in the Balkans. It is not a very common plant in the UK, being found in only a few localities in N. England and N. Wales although a little more plentiful in Scotland – where it is found as far north as Argyll and Aberdeenshire.
Meum has been cultivated in Scotland, where the roots were eaten as a root vegetable. The delicate, feathery foliage has been used as a condiment and in the preparation of a wide variety of home remedies as a diuretic, to control menstruation and uterine complaints and to treat catarrh, hysteria and stomach ailments. The scent of the roots of Meum has much in common with those of two other edible/medicinal umbellifers: Levisticum officinale and Angelica archangelica, while the aromatic flavour of Meum leaves is somewhat like Melilot (which owes its aroma of new-mown hay to coumarin) and is communicated to milk and butter when cows feed on the foliage in spring. The curious name Baldmoney is said to be derived from the name of the god Baldr (Scandinavian mythology) – to whom the plant was dedicated. In German it is known as Bärwurz [bear wort], feminine gender (die) for the plant and masculine gender (der) for a variety of Bavarian schnapps which is flavoured with its extract.

Frames is the third studio album by British progressive/alternative rock band Oceansize, released on 1 October 2007 on Superball Music. The album marks the first appearance of bassist Steven Hodson, following the departure of Jon Ellis in 2005.
In May 2008, the band re-released the album with an accompanying DVD, featuring a full performance of the album, a documentary focusing on the making of the album, and various live tracks. The package also includes an Oceansize sticker.
The band played the album in full on 18 October 2008 in Manchester as part of a trilogy of shows that celebrated the band's ten-year anniversary.
Vocalist/guitarist Mike Vennart states that:
Background
The album features "a lot of songs about grudges and negative energy”, with the song "Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt", inspired by a gift to Vennart by the band Cardiacs, which includes a time signature of "11/8 or 9/8, so when we were naming the song it was like 'it's in 11, it's in 9, it's got to be 9/11",
Regarding the album, Vennart states that:
Guitarist/Keyboardist Gambler revealed that Frames was their favorite record, stating that "after the changes that happened after Everyone Into Position – new bass player and new manager – that album seemed like a great achievement, kind of new beginning.". In this record, Gambler plays more keyboards than in previous and successive albums.
Title
Lead singer, Mike Vennart, notes that the title: “evokes strength and structure, and kind of sense of time as well – every second is like a frame of your life that's ticking away, and then it's gone. You can try and remember to try and look at it. But you'll probably only remember it as a snapshot, you won't remember the whole movement of the thing.”
Vennart however admitted that Frames was not the original title of the album. "The album was supposed to be called The Frame, after the song on the album, but then one of our friends, who's in Future of The Left, said ‘I love the title… Frames, isn't it?' We just thought, ‘well it wasn't, but that's a lot better. It's an angular title, it evokes strength and structure and it's quite cinematic. But hey, whatever you think it means, that's what it means!"
Song information
Mike Vennart states that "Commemorative T-Shirt" - originally entitled "Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt" - doesn't have "anything to do with 9/11. I was sold a t-shirt by the singer of the Cardiacs. On the label it read 'For ages 9-11', and when they sold it to me they said "oh, here's one of our commemorative 9/11 teeshirts," so I got thinking about what sort of person would wear a 9/11 teeshirt. Someone who's not really looking to the future.
Artwork
The ink drawings, featured in the album's artwork, are by Nine-Inch Nails and Guns N' Roses guitarist Robin Finck. Guitarist Gambler states that Finck is "a hero of mine. We saw their art; it is pretty ambiguous and amazing, so we just asked them if could we use some of their stuff."
Reception
The album was named as one of Classic Rock‘s 10 essential progressive rock albums of the decade.
Metal Storm.net gave the album a positive review, stating that "(the band)...didn't take so many risks but...found the way to write an album a lot deeper than its two previous ones.... Frames is a classy album that confirms that Oceansize deserves to be at the top of the list of the new wave of progressive bands. MusicOMH was also positive, in saying that the "instrumental track An Old Friend Of The Christies builds on a simple chorale-like statement to shake the rafters, while Trail Of Fire and Savant feature particularly impressive codas. Drummer Mark Heron gets in on the act, too, with some heavy gunfire in the fills of Commemorative T-Shirt and some most effective stick work evident even in the underpinning rhythms."
Scene Point Blank praised the work of producer/mixer Chris Sheldon, saying that "(Sheldon) actually matters a lot because they were more effective in bridging the group's melody with the experimental wildfire that permeates their existence. The influence of previous hands is particularly appreciated in the vocals department. With Sheldon back, gone are those all too frequent moments of Mike Vennart's croons being completely shredded into non-existence thanks to the tornado of guitars and drums that dominate the lion's share of Oceansize's material." The review continued on, stating that "Frames brandishes the near full cultivation of everything Oceansize has been trying to accomplish in such a brief period of time. Already proving to be light-years ahead of so many of their peers, one can only wait with bated breath to see what they do next. For the time being though, this record won't be leaving the rotation anytime soon."

Typhoon Maysak, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Chedeng, was the most powerful pre-April tropical cyclone on record in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. The fourth named storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season, Maysak originated as a tropical depression on March 26. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Maysak. According to the JMA, Maysak became the second typhoon of the year on March 28. The typhoon explosively intensified into a Category 5 super typhoon on March 31, passing near the islands of Chuuk and Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia. After maintaining that intensity for 18 hours, Maysak weakened, made landfall over the Philippine island of Luzon as a minimal tropical storm, and dissipated shortly afterwards.
Maysak affected Yap and Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, as well as the Philippines. The storm was responsible for four deaths in the Federated States of Micronesia alongside 10 injuries. Damage was estimated at $8.5 million (2015 USD). Estimates from the Red Cross suggested that there were 5,000 people in desperate need of food, water and shelter, and needed emergency assistance. Pacific Mission Aviation administrator Melinda Espinosa said "Most concrete structures withstood the fury but everything else was damaged." Later, the storm struck the Philippines, causing minimal damage.
Meteorological history
An area of convection persisted on March 24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially, it consisted of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March 26, the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March 27, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.
On March 28, microwave satellite imagery revealed an eye with central dense overcast obscuring most of the feature; accordingly, the JMA upgraded Maysak to a severe tropical storm. The storm continued to strengthen while moving westward along the periphery of a subtropical ridge, The eye became more defined and the convection became more consolidated. Early on March 29, the JMA upgraded Maysak further to typhoon status, estimating 10 minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). That day, the typhoon moved over Chuuk Lagoon, the first time an eye crossed the lagoon since Typhoon Amy in 1971. The storm developed good outflow, enhanced by a strong northerly flow, although moderate wind shear kept Maysak from intensifying more quickly. However, the eye became clearly visible on March 30, and the typhoon rapidly intensified after the shear diminished. The JTWC reported a wide eye displaying the stadium effect, and surrounded by very deep convection. On March 31, the agency assessed that Maysak intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the SSHWS, with 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph); this was increased to 280 km/h (175 mph) in post-season reanalysis, the highest on record for a pre-April typhoon. Around that time, the storm was moving through the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), passing just north of Fais Island, and also very near Ulithi. Late on March 31, Maysak reached its peak intensity, and the JMA estimated peak winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum pressure of , although operationally, the agency had estimated that Maysak was slightly more intense. This made Maysak the most powerful typhoon ever recorded before April, surpassing Typhoon Mitag of 2002, Typhoon Alice of 1979, and Typhoon Harriet of 1959.
At peak intensity, Maysak had a nearly symmetric eye with an almost perfect ring of convection around it, with characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone. On April 1, the eye widened to about after undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, and the storm began to weaken, with diminished intensity of the convection. The convection weakened significant in the storm's southern quadrant due to drier air and worsening upper-level conditions. On April 1, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started tracking Maysak, giving it the local name Chedeng. The eye widened further as dry air wrapped into the center, and stronger wind shear diminished the convection. On April 4, the JMA downgraded Maysak to a severe tropical storm, and later that day further to a tropical storm. The storm continued to weaken as it approached the Philippines, and late on April 4, the storm's the convection began dislocating from the circulation. On April 5, Maysak made landfall along east-central Luzon as a minimal tropical storm, making it one of only eight storms to strike the island between January and April since 1945. Soon after it degraded into a tropical depression, and the weakening storm crossed Luzon with scattered thunderstorms. After emerging into the South China Sea, the system continued to the west-northwest, and Maysak dissipated on April 7.
Impact
Federated States of Micronesia
Typhoon Maysak is responsible for extensive damage across the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), with Chuuk and Yap States suffering the brunt of its impact. Agricultural impact was extensive, with 90 percent of the banana, breadfruit, and taro crops destroyed in Chuuk and Yap states. Overall, 281 homes were destroyed, and another 300 were damaged. According to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), a total of 29,000 people were directly affected by the storm and damage throughout the FSM amounted to $8.5 million. There were four deaths and ten injuries related to the typhoon in the FSM.
Early in its development, Maysak brushed Kosrae within the FSM. Persistent westerly winds knocked down a few trees and damaged a few houses while also causing beach erosion. The storm later struck Chuuk State on March 29, passing directly over the main island as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, with gusts as high as 175 km/h (110 mph). Rainfall on Weno Island reached . High sustained winds, measured up to at the local National Weather Service office, downed numerous trees, power lines, and tore off roofs. An estimated 80–90 percent of homes in Chuuk sustained damage. The storm destroyed at least 830 homes and 37 businesses, displacing 6,760 people. Power to most of the state, including the entirety of Weno, was knocked out and communication was difficult. On Weno alone, the storm left about 7,000 people homeless. Water sources were rendered undrinkable. Outlying islands sustained heavy damage to crops and houses. Across Chuuk State, rough waves from the typhoon damaged seawalls and sank or damaged 11 boats or ships. There were at least four deaths in the state. A fallen tree killed a man and a child died after being struck by airborne debris. One person died due to a mudslide, and a newborn child died after being unable to arrive at the hospital due to fallen trees.
Two days after striking Chuuk, Maysak passed directly over Ulithi atoll and skirted Fais Island at peak intensity, resulting in extensive damage. According to Guam Governor Eddie Calvo, sustained winds reached in Ulithi and on Fais, with gusts reaching 240 km/h (150 mph) on Ulithi. All structures on Ulithi not made of concrete were severely damaged or destroyed by Maysak's powerful winds. Power and water supplies to Ulithi were completely lost during the storm. The entirety of the island's crop were ruined by the typhoon's storm surge, with early estimates indicating that it would be a full year before crops could be planted again. Though spared a direct hit, Yap proper was also hit hard with reports of airborne debris during the storm. Outlying islands were also affected; on Faraulep, water wells were contaminated and fruit trees were knocked down. During the storm, 18 fishermen were stranded Pikolot Island and West Fayew Island, but they returned home afterward.
Philippines
Ahead of the storm, over 24,000 people evacuated Philippines's northeastern province of Aurora. Many radio stations, typically which close during Easter, remained operational to broadcast the storm. Officials issued storm warnings, and the military was on alert. Beaches were closed, boats were ordered to remain at port, and 10 flights were canceled. The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that ₱300.9 million (US$6.8 million) worth of funds and supplies were available for possible relief efforts. Approximately 28,000 family food packs were prepositioned in warehouses across Luzon.
Striking the Philippines as a rapidly weakening system, Maysak had only minimal effects in the country, producing strong waves and light rainfall. Across Aurora and Isabela provinces, a total of 2,761 people were directly affected by the storm, most of whom were evacuated prior to Maysak's landfall. No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak hit them while they were taking selfies along the shoreline of Dipaculao town in Aurora province on April 4. An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April 3, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.
Aftermath
Chuuk Governor Johnson Elimo issued a state of emergency on April 1 and stated that international assistance was necessary. Immediate concerns included the possibility of residents starving with most of the state's crops ruined. Yap Governor Tony Ganngiyan also issued a state of emergency on April 1. On April 9, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia held a special two-day session at the request of President Manny Mori, which included determination of typhoon relief funds. They allocated $1.5 million toward relief for Chuuk and Yap States on April 11. The president also issued a price freeze to pre-storm levels to prevent price gouging.
The FSM government estimated that residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3–6 months following the typhoon. Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April 1. Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was the large number of trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April 6, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April 6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean. Relief supplies stockpiled by the Micronesian Red Cross were distributed in the immediate aftermath of Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April 8. On April 14, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen noodles, and water.
Due to their Compact of Free Association, United States President Barack Obama declared a state of disaster for the FSM on April 28, which allocated federal assistance for rebuilding. This followed a request by FSM President Mori on the previous day. USAID transported relief goods and $2.1 million worth of aid, including reverse osmosis kits and water distribution tanks. On Ulithi, the USAID delivered worth of food to residents. Throughout the FSM, the agency assisted in repairing buildings, providing housing assistance to residents whose homes were destroyed, as well as plastic sheeting. By May 8, the United States government had provided nearly $2.96 million in assistance, including $620,000 sent to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for regrowing damaged crops.
Several countries, agencies, and non-governmental organizations came to the aid of the FSM in the wake of Maysak. On April 13, the Government of Australia provided A$100,000 (US$77,000) and two patrol boats for recovery and relief operations. As an offer of "comfort and support", the Chinese government gave the FSM $500,000 in cash on April 21. The Government of Japan sent water treatment and transportation supplies to the FSM government, while the International Organization for Migration distributed 20 water treatment units to Ulithi. The European Union also sent 47 rainwater storage units, which would aid in helping future water supply.

The Pindal Electric Tramway is a small privately owned tramway operating on gauge in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.
History
Owned by Canadian animator Kaj Pindal, the tramway opened in 1965 in Montreal, but moved to Oakville in 1980. Essentially a garden railway, the line is unusual for its gauge of , usually associated with more extensive rail networks. The line is powered by overhead electric cables, with the power transmitted to the tramcars via pantograph, which is also highly unusual in the gauge. Although few private homes are able to accommodate a railway of gauge, the Pindal Electric Tramway operates, by agreement with the City of Oakville, partly on Pindal's private property, and partly on land owned by the city.
Rolling stock
The Pindal Electric Tramway operates a fleet of seven scale electric tramcars, and several passenger trailers, as well as a small number of flatbed and freight trailers.

The Teudopseina is a clade of stem-octopods that first evolved in the Toarcian, considered the largest clade of gladius-bearing coleoids in the Mesozoic. Up to five families are known, among which the Trachyteuthidae, Trachyteuthis in particular, are the most abundant.
Description
The Teudopseina can be united by five primary traits. These are the presence of a gladius, a reduced, spoon-shaped conus, a median field that is distinctly rounded or pointed anteriorly, weakly curved hyperbolar zones, and lateral fields shorter than the hyperbolar zones. Members of the superfamily Muensterelloidea are characterized by a spoon-shaped section of the gladius, known as the patella. This is believed to be ancestral to the condition present in modern octopuses.
Taxonomy
The current consensus is that the Teudopseina forms a stem-group of the Octopoda. Certain taxa, such as Enchoteuthis, have sometimes been classified as either relatives of giant squids or vampire squids.

The Abbey of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw ter Nieuwe Plant ("Our Lady of the New Plantation"; ), formerly also Roesbrugge Abbey () is a community of Augustinian canonesses belonging to the Congregation of Windesheim. The sisters are informally known as the Roesbrugge Dames - the Roesbrugge Ladies. Located in Roesbrugge from 1239 to the late 16th century, the community then moved into Ypres, West Flanders, Belgium, where it exists today. Its adjacent school is the Lyceum Onze Lieve Vrouw ter Nieuwe Plant.
History
The abbey was founded in 1239 at Roesbrugge by Willem van Bethune and their wife Elisabeth van Roesbrugge for the Canonesses Regular of St. Victor of Prémy Abbey near Cambrai. They are believed to have opened a school.
The abbey thrived, but in 1572 began the troubles of the Eighty Years' War. Marauding Calvinist soldiers made Roesbrugge uninhabitable for the community. Some of them sought refuge in Ypres, others in St. Omer. The abbey was pillaged by the Calvinists and subsequently laid waste by Spanish troops.
Once the County of Flanders was again in the hands of the King of Spain, the sisters in St. Omer returned. The Council of Trent recommended that monasteries should re-settle in or near towns, and the community from Roesbrugge decided to settle permanently in Ypres. They began once again to provide schooling, but more incidents of war caused them further setbacks.
In 1744 the abbey was destroyed by the troops of Louis XV, King of France, during the War of the Austrian Succession. Reconstruction began in 1778 and in 1782 the abbey was reopened. Yet again war intervened, this time between Austria and France in the French Revolution. For this reason, in 1793 a new abbess was not elected, only a prioress. In 1798 the abbey was seized by the French and sold. The sisters were dispersed, but after the Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII were able to buy back a piece of ground immediately adjacent to the site of the former abbey, and began their work again, including the management of a boarding school.
World War I forced the sisters to flee on 31 October 1914 and to take refuge in England. They moved to France in July 1915, where they helped Belgian students. When in February 1919 they returned to Ypres, everything was destroyed. In 1921 re-building began, to designs by the architect Camille Damman, and the abbey and its school have functioned since that time.
In 1967 the sisters, together with the canonesses of Bruges, founded St. Agnes' Abbey in Sion, Switzerland, which lasted until 1994.

The 2022 Pakistan economic crisis is an ongoing economic crisis in Pakistan, that has caused severe economic challenges for months due to which food, gas and oil prices have risen.
Background
Pakistan's economic crisis was at the centre of a political standoff between Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and their predecessor Imran Khan earlier this year, which led to Khan's ouster in April 2022. Sharif accused Khan of economic mismanagement and mishandling of the country's foreign policy, forcing them to step down in a no-confidence vote.
Timeline
Information Minister Maryam Aurangzeb told a news conference on 19 May 2022, that last month, Pakistan was committed to "controlling rising inflation, stabilizing foreign exchange reserves, strengthening the economy and reducing the country's dependence on imports". Import of unnecessary and luxury items was banned. Sharif had said at the time that the decision would "save the country's precious foreign exchange" and that Pakistan would have to "pursue austerity."
In late May 2022, the government lifted the cap on fuel prices - a condition for advancing the long-stalled bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). IMF also insisted Islamabad to raise electricity prices, ramp up tax collection and make sizeable budget cuts.
Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal told reporters on 14 May 2022, that Pakistanis could reduce their tea consumption to "one or two cups" a day as imports were putting additional financial pressure on the government. "The tea we import is imported on credit," Iqbal said, adding that businesses should be shut down first to save electricity. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, the South Asian nation of 220 million is the world's largest tea importer, having bought more than $ 640 million worth of tea in 2020.
Inflation in Pakistan rose to 21.3% in June, the highest since December 2008 when inflation stood at 23.3%.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said that a loan of $2.3 billion from a Chinese consortium of banks had been credited to the Pakistani central bank's account in late June.
Federal budget
On 10 June 2022, the government unveiled a new 47 billion budget for 2022-23 to persuade the IMF to resume the 6 billion bailout deals, which was agreed upon by both sides in 2019.

The Somali thrush (Turdus ludoviciae), also known as the Somali blackbird, is a songbird species in the family Turdidae. It is endemic to Somalia.
It has a black head and breast, yellow bill, brown back and wings and a grey belly with red sides.
Its natural habitats are montane juniper woodlands and open areas between 1,300 and 2,000 m.
It is threatened by habitat loss and was formerly classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Recent research has found that the loss of habitat is not as severe as first feared and the species is downlisted to The Least Concern in 2021. Local conservation efforts have apparently aided in the protection of forests.

The Boys Are Back is the thirtieth studio album of country music group The Oak Ridge Boys. It was released in 2009 under the Spring Hill Music Group label. The album marked the group's return to secular country music after releasing gospel albums since 1992. The track "Seven Nation Army," a cover of The White Stripes's 2003 song from their album Elephant, was released as the album's first single.
The track "Beautiful Bluebird" was written and previously recorded by country rock musical artist Neil Young for their 1985 album Old Ways, but was not included and instead featured on their 2007 album Chrome Dreams II. The track "Boom Boom" was written and recorded by John Lee Hooker on their 1962 album Burnin' . The song is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.
Background
After signing with Spring Hill Music Group in 2001, the group returned to its roots from the 1940s, releasing gospel material. But just as the group focused on country-pop in the late 1970s, the Oak Ridge Boys "recreated" themselves before the album's release, according to band member and producer Duane Allen.
Shooter Jennings, the son of the late country music legend Waylon Jennings, asked the Oak Ridge Boys to collaborate with them on their 2007 album The Wolf. Jennings introduced the group to record producer Dave Cobb, and invited them to a performance. After being surprised by the reaction of the youth-dominated crowd to the tune of "Elvira", Cobb took the band to a studio where they experimented with different sounds.
The group recorded the album in a studio in Nashville formerly used by Waylon Jennings, next door to the Oak Ridge Boys' former office. According to Allen, the album took only two weeks to record, with the group spending time in the studio every day until midnight or thereafter.
When asked about the album's content, bass singer Richard Sterban commented, "If there's something I could compare this to, it would be what Johnny Cash did in the later part of their career."
Reception
The record reached #16 on country album charts, the band's highest ranking since their 1988 album Monongahela. The album also stood at #77 on the Billboard 200, the group's first top 100 activity and highest ranking on the chart since the 1983 album American Made.
American Dreams
Allmusic gave the album a mixed review. While giving the album three out of five stars, the critic described the group as "overcompensating greatly." The title track, is described as "repetitive." The song "Seven Army Nation," received the most negative criticism, cited for missing "the mark by a mile" and showing "little understanding" of the song. "Boom Boom" also received negative marks from allmusic, who thought that Richard Sterban sounded like a "randy Mr. Ed." The reviewer also said that the album is a "fitfully entertaining comeback."
The Times Record News gave the album a B, lauding the vocals on the title track as "rich" and "unique." The publication cited the tracks "Mama's Table," "Troublin' Mind," "Live With Jesus" and "Hold Me Closely" as the standouts of the record.

The Nanded earthquakes were an earthquake swarm of over 500 events that has affected the town of Nanded in Maharashtra, India, that began in 2006. They were natural explosive sounds that were sometimes accompanied by mild tremors. The strongest events were felt on 31 March 2007, 12 November 2007, 14 December 2007, and on 3 March 2011. Each event caused widespread panic. Residents in the northern parts of Nanded that has been affected the most by the tremors moved to safer areas or stayed outdoors in temporary shelters in front of their homes.
Earthquakes
Nanded is in seismic zone 2. The exact cause of the tremors & explosive sounds is not yet known, but the city is within of where the 1993 Latur earthquake took place. At that time minor tremors were experienced in Nanded.
Residents in Nanded panicked and ran out of their homes at 3:17am on Thursday, 3 March 2011, when they felt earthquake tremors near magnitude 3. People were forced to abandon their homes to come out on the streets and open spaces as there were at least 39 aftershocks within the next 2 hours. These shocks were felt by the residents in Srinagar, Viveknagar, Kailashnagar, Snehnagar, Purna road, and Bhagyanagar. Though no casualties or damage were reported, the residents were terrorized by the tremors. The Nanded district collector called for an urgent meeting of the municipal council's section of disaster management and scientists from the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Hyderabad and Geological Survey of India (GSI), Nagpur were studying the shocks.
On Wednesday 31 August 2011, two shocks were experienced, the larger of the two being at 3:06am local time. The second shock was accompanied with an explosive sound in the ground. Government officials and the media did not comment or publish any news on these shocks. Minor explosive sounds were heard in the ground on 7 September 2011 at around 9:00am and again at 4:00pm. The scientists from the NGRI, Hyderabad and GSI, Nagpur did not announce any of their observations or update their research results.
Cause
The epicentres of the earthquakes define a northwest-southeast trending fault plane, parallel to most of the mapped faults in the area. The focal mechanism derived from all of the minor earthquakes is consistent with high-angle reverse faulting.

In Greek mythology, the name Lycastus (Λύκαστος) may refer to:
Lycastus, a Cretan king and son of Minos I and Itone. They were the husband of Ida, daughter of Corybas, and by their father of Minos II.
Lycastus, twin brother of Parrhasius, whose parents were Ares and Phylonome, daughter of Nyctimus and Arcadia. Their mother was seduced by Ares in the guise of a shepherd; in fear of their father's wrath, they cast the newborn twins into the river Erymanthus. They did not drown and were washed into the hollow of an oak tree, where a she-wolf found and suckled them, giving up their own cubs. The twins were then adopted and raised by a shepherd named Gyliphus, and eventually succeeded to the throne of Arcadia. Their story is closely parallel, and is cited as such by Pseudo-Plutarch, to that of Romulus and Remus.
Lycastus, lover of Eulimene, who unsuccessfully attempted to save their loved one from being sacrificed.
Lycastus, an autochthon, eponym of the town Lycastus in Crete, which might as well have been named after the son of Minos.

"2020: A Year In Review" is the first episode of the fifteenth season of the American sitcom television series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It is the 155th overall episode of the series and was written by series developers, executive producers and lead actors Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Glenn Howerton and directed by Todd Biermann. It originally aired on FXX on December 1, 2021, airing back-to-back with the follow-up episode, "The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 7".
The series follows "The Gang", a group of five misfit friends: twins Dennis and Deandra "(Sweet) Dee" Reynolds, their friends Charlie Kelly and Ronald "Mac" McDonald, and Frank Reynolds, Dennis' and Dee's legal father. The Gang runs the fictional Paddy's Pub, an unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia. In the episode, the gang looks back on 2020 to justify their numerous PPP loans. In doing so, it is revealed that they contributed to the chaos of the past political year way more than anyone could have imagined. With the episode's airing, the series officially became the longest-running live-action comedy series in American television history, breaking the record set by The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.
According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.285 million household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the way the series integrated their storylines on the real-life events that occurred in 2020, although one critic unfavorably viewed the three different storylines as failed sketches.
Plot
The gang welcomes a man named Gary (Brian Huskey), whom they assume will help them get a PPP loan. But Gary is actually there to collect three different loans, asking to explain what they have done with the money. The gang then explains how 2020 forced them to adapt to a new environment.
The first loan, "Punch Incorporated", was taken out by Mac (Rob McElhenney) and Dennis (Glenn Howerton). They used the loan to get riot gear to sell for the 2020 elections, but they used the opportunity to drive interest to their music careers and instead of prompting people to vote for real candidates, the poll is actually just to decide whether Donovan McNabb or Rocky Balboa is the better athlete because of a discussion they previously had. Their actions resulted in vote delays, although they claim this helped their music careers as business on the bar was dropping.
The second loan was taken out by Frank (Danny DeVito), named "Frank's Imports and Exports". Frank claims to had sludges imported and hair dye exported for himself. Tired of the lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, Frank constantly ignores proper safety protocols, like incorrectly wearing masks. They use ingredients to create hair dye, like Chinese motor oil. They open a business in an adult film store, helping men of a certain age with hair dyeing. Eventually, one of their clients turns out to be Rudy Giuliani. But Giulani's hair dye runs down their face during a press conference after the election, and Frank decides to end the business when they realize their hair dye is no longer reliable.
The third loan is for a clothing line named "Garments and Varmints", issued by Charlie (Charlie Day) and Dee (Kaitlin Olson). They decided to open a mask business during the COVID-19 pandemic although Charlie is only making costume masks. They combine their ideas and help QAnon with some raccoon-pelt costumes. They sell the costumes to Jake Angeli, who wears it during the 2021 Capitol attack.
The gang once again tries to get a loan but Gary states that they will not help them, calling them out for their careless approach to their businesses, which all went bankrupt. The gang then states that had "the other guy" won the election, their businesses would have prospered. Gary assumes they mean Donald Trump but they are actually referring to Kanye West's election campaign. A shocked Gary then leaves, refusing to believe they participated in all these major events. The final montage shows that the gang was present in many events, including the 2021 Capitol attack.
Production
Development
In May 2018, ahead of the series' thirteenth season, Charlie Day said the cast and crew intended to get the series to a fifteenth season, saying "I imagine we'll all want to hold the record for the longest-running comedy in America. Fifteen would be the record for the longest live-action comedy, so we'll probably try and break that record if we can." In January 2020, renewal talks were underway, with FX Networks and FX Productions Chairman John Landgraf and FX Entertainment President Eric Schrier expressing interest in keeping the show on the air. In May 2020, FX renewed It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia for a fifteenth season, with Rob McElhenney indicating writing had already started on the season. With the renewal, the series became the longest-running live-action comedy series in American television history, replacing The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 14 seasons between 1952 and 1966. In November 2021, it was announced that the season would premiere on December 1, 2021.
In August 2021, it was reported that the first episode of the fifteenth season would be titled "2020: A Year In Review", and was to be directed by Todd Biermann and written by series developers, executive producers and lead actors Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Glenn Howerton. The episode was McElhenney's 55th writing credit, Day's 61st writing credit, and Howerton's 42nd writing credit.
Writing
Rob McElhenney said that the series would address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, saying "Well, we actually do have an episode called 'The Gang Gets Quarantined' where we quarantine ourselves in the bar. I think there's a big flu going around Philadelphia or something like that. When we come back, don't worry, we will address all this in the way only Sunny can."
Filming
Filming for the episode and the season started in May 2021.
Reception
Viewers
In its original American broadcast, "2020: A Year In Review" was seen by an estimated 0.285 million household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 0.14 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a 20% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 0.236 million viewers with a 0.13 in the 18-49 demographics. But it was a 32% decrease in viewership from the previous season premiere, which was watched by 0.481 million viewers with a 0.28 in the 18-49 demographics.
Critical reviews
"2020: A Year In Review" received generally positive reviews from critics. Ross Bonaime of Collider wrote, "Season 15 of It's Always Sunny shows no sign of this now record-breaking show slowing down, as it continues its reign as one of the most ingenious, unexpected, and uproarious series of the 21st century."
Liz Shannon Miller of Consequence wrote, "It's not only a great and necessary scene-setter, given the show's longer-than-usual hiatus (the last season ended in November 2019), but it also threads the needle admirably when it comes to tackling some of the most politically tumultuous moments of the last two years, with plenty of unexpected curveballs along the way." Ray Flook of Bleeding Cool wrote, "They had no clue that they were doing any of that, but they're okay with it since their guy wasn't being given a fair chance and that's why they lost the election. 'Their guy'? Yup. Kanye West. And that's when it all came together for me and why it worked so well. Because what I thought was going to be a Forrest Gump/Zelig-like "welcome back" by The Gang as they took some fun shots at the past year became a lot more than that."
Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a "C+" grade and wrote, "It's an uncharacteristically wheezy first episode out of the gate that leaves It's Always Sunny looking distressingly ordinary. Of course both the 2020 election and a global pandemic were going to bring out the worst in the Gang. But the Gang's worst is usually a whole lot better than this."

The 871st Bombardment Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. During World War II it was assigned to the 497th Bombardment Group until it was inactivated on 31 March 1946. The squadron was activated in late 1943. After training in the United States, it moved to Saipan, where it served in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan with Twentieth Air Force, flying Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft in the Pacific Theater of Operations, where it earned two Distinguished Unit Citations. Following V-J Day, the squadron returned to the United States and briefly became part of Strategic Air Command before inactivating.
In 2007 the squadron was converted to provisional status as the 871st Air Expeditionary Squadron and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe to activate or inactivate as needed. It was activated in 2008 at Accra, Ghana.
History
Activation and training
The squadron was established in late 1943 as the 871st Bombardment Squadron at El Paso Army Air Base, Texas, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron that was one of the original operational squadrons of the 497th Bombardment Group. The squadron's initial cadre was drawn from the 491st Bombardment Group.
In December the squadron moved on paper to Clovis Army Air Field, New Mexico. At Clovis, the squadron began to man its air echelon by January 1944. The 871st drew heavily on aircrews of the 480th Antisubmarine Group who were returning to the United States from duty in England and Africa to fill out its crews. Aircrew training at Clovis was limited to ground training, although some flying in Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft assigned to the 73d Bombardment Wing was accomplished. Key personnel trained with the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida.
In April 1944, the air and ground echelons united at Pratt Army Air Field. Here the 871st finally received newly manufactured Boeing B-29 Superfortresses the following month, although it continued to fly B-17s as well due to continuing engine problems with the B-29s. In May the United States Army Air Forces reorganized its very heavy bombardment units. The 872d Bombardment Squadron and support units of the 497th group were inactivated and their personnel absorbed into the 871st and the remaining squadrons of the group.
Combat in the Pacific
The 871st deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations, with the ground echelon sailing 30 July on the SS Fairisle, passing through Honolulu and Eniwetok before arriving at Saipan on 20 September. Upon arrival the squadron's personnel were engaged in construction. By mid-October most personnel were able to move into Quonset huts from the tents which they were assigned on arrival. The aircrews began departing Kansas on 6 October, ferrying their aircraft to Saipan via a 6500 nautical mile route, with the last B-29 arriving on 30 October. At Saipan the unit became part of the XXI Bomber Command at Isely Field.
The squadron began operations on 28 October 1944 with a night attack against the submarine pens at Truk Islands and attacks against Iwo Jima in early November. The squadron took part in the first attack on Japan by AAF planes based in the Marianas. On 24 November 1944 110 aircraft of the 73rd Bombardment Wing bombed Tokyo on this mission. The 871st flew missions against strategic objectives in Japan, originally in daylight and from high altitude. It was also tasked with "Weather Strike" missions which were single ship flights flown nightly to obtain weather information for target areas in Japan while also making incendiary attacks on various targets.
The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for a mission on 27 January 1945. Although weather conditions prevented the group from bombing its primary objective, the unescorted B-29's withstood severe enemy attacks to strike an alternate target, the industrial area of Hamamatsu. It was awarded a second DUC for attacking strategic centers in Japan during July and August 1945. The squadron assisted the assault on Okinawa in April 1945 by bombing enemy airfields to cut down air attacks against the invasion force. Beginning on 19 March and continuing until the end of the war the squadron made incendiary raids against Japan, flying at night and at low altitude to bomb area targets. The unit released propaganda leaflets over the Japanese home islands, continuing strategic bombing raids and incendiary attacks until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.
Return to the United States and inactivation
After V-J Day, the 871st dropped supplies to Allied prisoners. In November 1945 the unit returned to the United States where it was become part of Continental Air Forces at March Field, California. In January 1945, the 871st moved to MacDill Field, Florida. In March 1946 CAF became Strategic Air Command (SAC), and the squadron was one of SAC's first bombardment squadrons. Demobilization, however, was in full swing and the squadron turned in its aircraft and was inactivated on 31 March.
Expeditionary operations
In 2007 the squadron was converted to provisional status as the 871st Air Expeditionary Squadron and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe to activate or inactivate as needed. It was activated in 2008 at Accra, Ghana.
The squadron was again activated in April 2015 at Keflavik International Airport for the Icelandic Air Surveillance and Policing mission. Iceland does not maintain its own military force, so the United States and other NATO allies periodically rotate through Keflavik to maintain the integrity and security of Iceland's airspace. the 2015 deployment included four McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle fighters from RAF Lakenheath, a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker from RAF Mildenhall and approximately 200 airmen.

In futures studies and the history of technology, accelerating change is a perceived increase in the rate of technological change throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change.
Early observations
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London Daniel Burnham noted, "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the geometric widening of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on." And later on, "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."
In 1938, Buckminster Fuller introduced the word ephemeralization to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of industrial development. In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.
In 1958, Stanislaw Ulam wrote in reference to a conversation with John von Neumann:
Moravec's Mind Children
In a series of published articles from 1974 to 1979, and then in their 1988 book Mind Children, computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec generalizes Moore's law to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an exponential growth pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.
In Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence, generalizing Moore's law to technologies predating the integrated circuit, and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, they speculate about a coming "mind fire" of rapidly expanding superintelligence similar to the explosion of intelligence predicted by Vinge.
James Burke's Connections
In their TV series Connections (1978)—and sequels Connections² (1994) and Connections³ (1997)—James Burke explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.
Burke also explores three corollaries to their initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we were not even aware of at the time.
The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.
Gerald Hawkins' Mindsteps
In their book Mindsteps to the Cosmos (HarperCollins, August 1983), Gerald S. Hawkins elucidated their notion of mindsteps, dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views. They identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." They noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. Their speculations ventured beyond the technological:
Vinge's exponentially accelerating change
The mathematician Vernor Vinge popularized their ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel Marooned in Realtime (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. Their subsequent Hugo award-winning novel A Fire Upon the Deep (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a superintelligence passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a transcendent, almost omnipotent power unfathomable by mere humans. Theirs already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the technological singularity compactly summarizes the basic ideas.
Kurzweil's The Law of Accelerating Returns
In their 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines, Ray Kurzweil proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially. They gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns". In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe exponential growth of diverse forms of technological progress. Whenever a technology approaches some kind of barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. They cite numerous past examples of this to substantiate their assertions. They predict that such paradigm shifts have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history". They believe the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a technological singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of Moore's law. It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology, when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many futurists still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.
According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of evolution, more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. language, numbers, written language, philosophy, scientific method, instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on their views in their books The Age of Spiritual Machines and The Singularity Is Near.
Limits of accelerating change
Applying a scientific approach, we will notice in natural science that it is typical that processes characterized by exponential acceleration in their initial stages go into the saturation phase. This clearly makes it possible to realize that if an increase with acceleration is observed over a certain period of time, this does not mean an endless continuation of this process. On the contrary, in many cases this means an early exit to the plateau of speed. The processes occurring in natural science allow us to suggest that the observed picture of accelerating scientific and technological progress, after some time (in physical processes, as a rule, is short) will be replaced by a slowdown and a complete stop? Despite the possible termination / attenuation of the acceleration of the progress of science and technology in the foreseeable future, progress itself, and as a result, social transformations, will not stop or even slow down - it will continue with the achieved (possibly huge) speed, which has become constant.
Accelerating change may not be restricted to the Anthropocene Epoch, but a general and predictable developmental feature of the universe. The physical processes that generate an acceleration such as Moore's law are positive feedback loops giving rise to exponential or superexponential technological change. These dynamics lead to increasingly efficient and dense configurations of Space, Time, Energy, and Matter (STEM efficiency and density, or STEM "compression"). At the physical limit, this developmental process of accelerating change leads to black hole density organizations, a conclusion also reached by studies of the ultimate physical limits of computation in the universe.
Applying this vision to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence leads to the idea that advanced intelligent life reconfigures itself into a black hole. Such advanced life forms would be interested in inner space, rather than outer space and interstellar expansion. They would thus in some ways transcend reality, not be observable and it would be a solution to Fermi's paradox called the "transcension hypothesis". Another solution is that the black holes we observe could actually be interpreted as intelligent super-civilizations feeding on stars, or "stellivores".
This dynamics of evolution and development is an invitation to study the universe itself as evolving, developing. If the universe is a kind of superorganism, it may possibly tend to reproduce, naturally or artificially, with intelligent life playing a role.
Other estimates
Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of some technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the Paleolithic era until the Neolithic Revolution. The new agricultural economy doubled every 900 years, a remarkable increase. In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the world's economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than during the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligence causes a similar revolution, argues Robin Hanson, then one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis.
In their 1981 book Critical Path, futurist and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller estimated that if we took all the knowledge that humankind had accumulated and transmitted by the year One CE as equal to one unit of information, it probably took about 1500 years (or until the sixteenth century) for that amount of knowledge to double. The next doubling of knowledge from two to four 'knowledge units' took only 250 years, until about 1750 CE. By 1900, one hundred and fifty years later, knowledge had doubled again to 8 units. The observed speed at which information doubled was getting faster and faster.
In modern times, exponential knowledge progressions therefore change at an ever-increasing rate. Depending on the progression, this tends to lead toward explosive growth at some point. A simple exponential curve that represents this accelerating change phenomenon could be modeled by a doubling function. This fast rate of knowledge doubling leads up to the basic proposed hypothesis of the technological singularity: the rate at which technology progression surpasses human biological evolution.
Criticisms
Both Theodore Modis and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.

Herman Cameron Norman (8 June 1872 – 8 September 1955) was a British Diplomat who represented Britain in Iran. They were an important figure in the lead up to 1921 coup d'état.
Norman was born in London to Charles Lloyd Norman and Julia Hay Cameron, daughter of jurist Charles Hay Cameron and photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, granddaughter of Charles Cameron, Governor of the Bahamas, and granddaughter of the 15th Earl of Erroll. They were educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. They joined the Foreign Office in 1894 and served in various positions in Cairo, Washington DC, Tokyo, St Petersburg, Buenos Aires and Constantinople between 1896 and 1916. They were part of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. They served as the British Diplomat in Tehran from May 1920 to October 1921. Serving under Lord Curzon, they were instrumental in the ascension of Hassan Pirnia to the role of prime minister. Relations between Lord Curzon and Herman Cameron Norman became sour after Norman's tenure, so much so that Lord Curzon refused to see Herman upon their return from Tehran. Lord Curzon held the belief that Norman was singularly responsible for the failure of the British control of Iran. Norman, who did not back down from how they felt about the incompetence of Mostowfi ol-Mamalek communicated to Lord Curzon about how the current British policy towards Iran is unpopular with the Iranian population and would cause more harm for Britain in the long-run. Norman retired in 1924 after refusing the post of minister to Santiago.
Herman Norman's role in the 1921 coup d'état is unclear; however, it is argued by historian Cyrus Ghani that it is very unlikely that Norman did not know of the Persian Cossack Brigade marching from Qazvin to Tehran. The evidence that Ghani provides are the fact that the telegraphs between Norman and George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston averaged around one a day, compared to the normal three times a day; and the odd series of events which had Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Smyth order 2200 men from the Cossack Qazvin division into Tehran for disciplining unruly soldiers from the Cossack division in Tehran, and then the subsequent reversal of the order by Norman with the request of Ahmad Shah Qajar. The latter point is suspect because it would seem that the refitting of the Cossack would have been done in stages, especially due to the fact that the risk of Bolsheviks from the north of Iran was so prevalent. A motivating factor for Norman could have been the incompetence of the Fathollah Khan Akbar as prime minister. This feeling might have been a result of the Anglo-Persian Agreement still not being implemented, British financial officers being hampered from doing their work, and finally the repeated difficulties in forming a competent cabinet. However, it should be mentioned that Ghani points out that Norman's involvement cannot be concretely proven, was they a pawn in Edmund Ironside's plan for a renewed Persia? was they complicit in the planning and execution of the 1921 coup d'état? or was they actually in the dark about the events that were to take place?. Ironside in their memoirs High Road to Command and their private unpublished diaries makes it very clear that they acted alone in arming and clothing the disheveled Persian Cossacks without the knowledge of the Foreign Office, Curzon or Norman to protect their rear in carrying out their orders to withdraw British forces from Iran and modern day Iraq. Peter Mallard the son of the Third Secretary in the British Legation publishing extracts from their father Victor Mallet's diary in Asian Affairs Voume 25 of 1994 makes it clear that the Legation was not aware of any British plans for a Coup.

Stereotypes of French people include real or imagined characteristics of the French people used by people who see the French people as a single and homogeneous group.
There exist stereotypes of French people amongst themselves depending on the region.
England
Stereotypes of the French by the British people, especially the English people, have existed for centuries. This is in part due to the many Anglo-French Wars (1193-1815).
United States
Americans view the French as effeminate and cowardly. Francophobia and xenophobic sentiments towards the French have been an established part of the Culture of the United States. The French also have a reputation for being cheap or 'radin' in French, often because they refuse to tip. They tend to spend less on food, clothes and cars compared to most Americans.
Common stereotypes
High fashion
France, particularly Paris, has been perceived for being a high fashion place where designer clothes and cosmetics are made.
Hygiene
Thay have very good hygiene!
Laziness
The perception that French workers are prone to strikes and take a lot of time off has established a stereotype of the French being workshy.
Onion Johnny
A common stereotypical image of French people, especially in British media, was of a man on a bicycle wearing a striped jumper and beret with a string of onions around their neck. This derives from the "Onion Johnny," a nickname for Breton itinerant onion-sellers who cycled around England and Wales in the 20th century; for many British people, this would be their only contact with French people.
Cowardice
The French are perceived as cowards due to the fact that it only took 46 days for the French army to surrender to the Nazis during World War II. The country's refusal to join allied forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq cemented that reputation, even gaining the French some colorful nicknames such as “Cheese-eating surrender monkeys”.
Romance
French men and women are perceived as being very romantic.
Rudeness
French waiters have been perceived as rude and disrespectful, especially to foreigners who speak little to no French.
Smokers
Smoking in France is a common trope when associated with France, especially the local Gauloises brand.
Weak military
Despite being one of the world's leading powers from the 17th–19th centuries, the French military had been perceived as poor in armed combat and could be easily defeated in armed struggles, thus likely to surrender. The stereotype is attributed to France's roles during World War II and the Franco-Prussian War, in which the French government surrendered to German forces.
Food
The French are commonly regarded to enjoy eating snails and plenty of bread, particularly baguettes and croissants.

Orb and Sceptre is a march for orchestra written by William Walton for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London, on 2 June 1953. It follows the pattern of earlier concert marches by Elgar and Walton themselves in consisting of a brisk opening section followed by a broad melody in the middle, trio, section and a return to the lively first theme to conclude the piece after a second appearance of the big tune.
Background and first performances
Walton had composed the march Crown Imperial, in 1936 for the coronation of Elizabeth II's father, King George VI. It was generally well received – the BBC predicted that it would be ranked alongside Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches – but disappointed those of Walton's admirers who thought of them as an avant-garde composer. By 1953 Walton was no longer perceived as avant-garde, and a ceremonial march in the Elgar tradition was generally expected. Orb and Sceptre was commissioned by the Arts Council of Great Britain, and Walton obtained permission to dedicate the piece to the Queen, a considerable honour, as such permission was rarely granted.
Walton said that they had taken the title of Crown Imperial from a speech in Shakespeare's Henry V:
I am a king that find thee, and I know
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
The farced title running 'fore the king,
The throne they sit on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world,
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave.
Turning to the same speech for the title of their new work, they said they jibbed at Ball and Sceptre and turned it into Orb and Sceptre. (He said they were reserving Bed Majestical for the coronation of King Charles III.)Orb and Sceptre was recorded for the gramophone twice before its public debut at the Coronation service. Walton flew from their home in Ischia to conduct the piece with the Philharmonia Orchestra for Columbia on 18 March 1953 at the Kingsway Hall, and Sir Malcolm Sargent conducted the work with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) for Decca at the same venue. The public premiere was given by the Coronation Orchestra (a specially convened ensemble comprising leading players from British orchestras and string quartets) conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. The first concert performance was by the LSO conducted by Sir John Barbirolli at the Royal Festival Hall five days later. Walton conducted the first American performance of the work at the Hollywood Bowl on 13 August 1953, in their debut conducting appearance in the US.
Structure
The critic Frank Howes finds the opening section of the work more thematically complex than that of Crown Imperial. It begins in the key of E major with bright trumpet fanfares before leaping into the march section, heavily syncopated and brightly orchestrated. This section moves briefly through what Howes call a "drastic modulation" into C major before returning to E.
As with Crown Imperial the middle section is a quieter trio in C, marked meno mosso. This theme is heard subdued on the strings, before being repeated in its more stately and grand form. The main march section is then heard again, building up to the final hearing of the trio section back in the home key of E. This time Walton uses the whole orchestra, the tune shared between fortissimo strings and fanfare-like brass. A short, fast coda ends the piece.
InstrumentationOrb and Sceptre is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 3 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, tambourine, harp, organ (optional), and strings.
Reception
Walton struggled to find inspiration for the piece, and during its composition they thought it would not be as good as Crown Imperial. They later convinced themselves that it was not inferior to its predecessor. Their biographer Michael Kennedy disagrees, feeling that Orb and Sceptre lacks as fine a central tune and such "vigorous panache" in the fast outer sections as those of Crown Imperial. The Times found the work joyous and youthful, with, in the trio:
ArrangementsOrb and Sceptre'' has been arranged for organ by Sir William McKie, for piano and for small orchestra, both by Roy Douglas, and for military band.

"Flamingo" and "Teenage Riot" are songs by Japanese singer Kenshi Yonezu, released together as a double A-side single on October 31, 2018. It is Yonezu's ninth single, and their fifth single since moving to Sony Music.
Creation
"Flamingo" contains a number of voice samples, including "trembling lips", purring, clearing throats, and even what sounds like fragments of a conversation, such as "ah, yep". Initially, Yonezu created up to the first chorus in a simple, minimalist form with just bass, a kick drum and snare, but felt that after they added voices the song was complete. Yonezu was also influenced by recalling things from when they had been drinking. The song is told from the perspective of a pleasure-seeking person.

was a politician, educator and writer in Meiji period Japan. They were one of the founders of Aoyama Gakuin university, and the father of noted author Tsuda Umeko.
Biography
Tsuda was born as the fourth son of a low ranking samurai of Sakura domain in Shimōsa (present day Sakura city, Chiba Prefecture). At the age of 15, they were sent to the domain's school, where they learned English and Dutch, and afterwards was sent to Edo, where they studied rangaku. They were hired by the Tokugawa bakufu as an interpreter, and accompanied Fukuzawa Yukichi on a mission to purchase warships in the United States in 1867.
After the Meiji Restoration, Tsuda joined the new Meiji government, and enthusiastically embraced the rapid westernization drive. They opened the first western style hotel in Tsukiji in 1867, near the foreign settlement. They also spent time with the Hokkaido Colonization Office, where they made close contacts with future Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka. Around this time they developed a strong interest in women's education, and when the revolutionary idea of sending women overseas as exchange students with the Iwakura Mission, they quickly volunteered their daughter Umeko. Tsuda also influenced the creation of the Friends School, a women's junior and senior high school established in 1887 in Tokyo.
In 1873 Tsuda attended the Vienna Expo, where they met Sano Tsunetami (founder of the Japanese Red Cross), and where they received a lesson on Western agricultural techniques, particularly artificial crop pollination. After returning to Japan in May 1874, they opened the Gakunosha Nogakko (Gakunosha School of Agriculture) in Azabu, Tokyo and worked to introduce and promote Western vegetables (particularly corn) and fruits. They initially sold the corn by mail advertisement, and is thus also the first such entrepreneur in Japan. They also established a magazine, Nogyo Zasshi, aimed at the agricultural market. Around this time, it is believed that they also converted to Christianity, and they later became a strong temperance campaigner.
A supporter of agrarian rights, they were involved in the Ashio Copper Mine Scandal, one of Japan's first environmental disputes.
Tsuda also played an important role in establishing Christian schools, such as Aoyama Gakuin, Doshisha University, Friend's Girls' School, and Tokyo School for the Blind and Deaf (currently the Tsukuba Daigaku Fuzoku Mougakko). They were involved in most of the work to create the early foundation of Aoyama Gakuin.
They died on the Tokaido line train of a cerebral hemorrhage, and their funeral was held in the auditorium of Aoyama Gakuin, and their grave is at Aoyama Cemetery.

A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a local area network (LAN) within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, campus, or office building. This gives users the ability to move around within the area and remain connected to the network. Through a gateway, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.
Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standards are the most widely used computer networks in the world. These are commonly called Wi-Fi, which is a trademark belonging to the Wi-Fi Alliance. They are used for home and small office networks that link together laptop computers, printers, smartphones, Web TVs and gaming devices with a wireless router, which links them to the internet. Hotspots provided by routers at restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and airports allow consumers to access the internet with portable wireless devices.
History
Norman Abramson, a professor at the University of Hawaii, developed the world's first wireless computer communication network, ALOHAnet. The system became operational in 1971 and included seven computers deployed over four islands to communicate with the central computer on the Oahu island without using phone lines.
Wireless LAN hardware initially cost so much that it was only used as an alternative to cabled LAN in places where cabling was difficult or impossible. Early development included industry-specific solutions and proprietary protocols, but at the end of the 1990s these were replaced by technical standards, primarily the various versions of IEEE 802.11 (in products using the Wi-Fi brand name).
Beginning in 1991, a European alternative known as HiperLAN/1 was pursued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) with a first version approved in 1996. This was followed by a HiperLAN/2 functional specification with ATM influences accomplished February 2000. Neither European standard achieved the commercial success of 802.11, although much of the work on HiperLAN/2 has survived in the physical specification (PHY) for IEEE 802.11a, which is nearly identical to the PHY of HiperLAN/2.
In 2009 802.11n was added to 802.11. It operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands at a maximum data transfer rate of 600 Mbit/s. Most newer routers are dual-band and able to utilize both wireless bands. This allows data communications to avoid the crowded 2.4 GHz band, which is also shared with Bluetooth devices and microwave ovens. The 5 GHz band also has more channels than the 2.4 GHz band, permitting a greater number of devices to share the space. Not all WLAN channels are available in all regions.
A HomeRF group formed in 1997 to promote a technology aimed for residential use, but it disbanded in January 2003.
Architecture
Stations
All components that can connect into a wireless medium in a network are referred to as stations. All stations are equipped with wireless network interface controllers. Wireless stations fall into two categories: wireless access points (WAPs), and clients. WAPs are base stations for the wireless network. They transmit and receive radio frequencies for wireless-enabled devices to communicate with. Wireless clients can be mobile devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants, VoIP phones and other smartphones, or non-portable devices such as desktop computers, printers, and workstations that are equipped with a wireless network interface.
Service set
The basic service set (BSS) is a set of all stations that can communicate with each other at PHY layer. Every BSS has an identification (ID) called the BSSID, which is the MAC address of the access point servicing the BSS.
There are two types of BSS: Independent BSS (also referred to as IBSS), and infrastructure BSS. An independent BSS (IBSS) is an ad hoc network that contains no access points, which means they cannot connect to any other basic service set. In an IBSS the STAs are configured in ad hoc (peer-to-peer) mode.
An extended service set (ESS) is a set of connected BSSs. Access points in an ESS are connected by a distribution system. Each ESS has an ID called the SSID which is a 32-byte (maximum) character string.
A distribution system (DS) connects access points in an extended service set. The concept of a DS can be used to increase network coverage through roaming between cells. DS can be wired or wireless. Current wireless distribution systems are mostly based on WDS or MESH protocols, though other systems are in use.
Types of wireless LANs
The IEEE 802.11 has two basic modes of operation: infrastructure and ad hoc mode. In ad hoc mode, mobile units communicate directly peer-to-peer. In infrastructure mode, mobile units communicate through a wireless access point (WAP) that also serves as a bridge to other networks such as a local area network or the Internet.
Since wireless communication uses a more open medium for communication in comparison to wired LANs, the 802.11 designers also included encryption mechanisms: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), no longer considered secure, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, WPA3), to secure wireless computer networks. Many access points will also offer Wi-Fi Protected Setup, a quick, but no longer considered secure, method of joining a new device to an encrypted network.
Infrastructure
Most Wi-Fi networks are deployed in infrastructure mode. In infrastructure mode, wireless clients, such as laptops and smartphones, connect to the WAP to join the network. The WAP usually has a wired network connection and may have permanent wireless connections to other WAPs.
WAPs are usually fixed, and provide service to their client nodes within range. Some networks will have multiple WAPs, using the same SSID and security arrangement. In that case, connecting to any WAP on that network joins the client to the network and the client software will try to choose the WAP that gives the best service, such as the WAP with the strongest signal.
Peer-to-peer
An ad hoc network is a network where stations communicate only peer-to-peer (P2P). There is no base and no one gives permission to talk. This is accomplished using the Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). A Wi-Fi Direct network is a different type of wireless network where stations communicate peer-to-peer. In a peer-to-peer network wireless devices within range of each other can discover and communicate directly without involving central access points.
In a Wi-Fi P2P group, the group owner operates as an access point and all other devices are clients. There are two main methods to establish a group owner in the Wi-Fi Direct group. In one approach, the user sets up a P2P group owner manually. This method is also known as autonomous group owner (autonomous GO). In the second method, called negotiation-based group creation, two devices compete based on the group owner intent value. The device with higher intent value becomes a group owner and the second device becomes a client. Group owner intent value can depend on whether the wireless device performs a cross-connection between an infrastructure WLAN service and a P2P group, available power in the wireless device, whether the wireless device is already a group owner in another group or a received signal strength of the first wireless device.
IEEE 802.11 defines the PHY and medium access control (MAC) layers based on carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). This is in contrast to Ethernet which uses carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). The 802.11 specification includes provisions designed to minimize collisions because mobile units have to contend with the hidden node problem where two mobile units may both be in range of a common access point, but out of range of each other.
Bridge
A bridge can be used to connect networks, typically of different types. A wireless Ethernet bridge allows the connection of devices on a wired Ethernet network to a wireless network. The bridge acts as the connection point to the wireless LAN.
Wireless distribution system
A wireless distribution system (WDS) enables the wireless interconnection of access points in an IEEE 802.11 network. It allows a wireless network to be expanded using multiple access points without the need for a wired backbone to link them, as is traditionally required. The notable advantage of a WDS over some other solutions is that it preserves the MAC addresses of client packets across links between access points.
An access point can be either a main, relay, or remote base station. A main base station is typically connected to the wired Ethernet. A relay base station relays data between remote base stations, wireless clients or other relay stations to either a main or another relay base station. A remote base station accepts connections from wireless clients and passes them to relay or main stations.
Because data is forwarded wirelessly, consuming wireless bandwidth, throughput in this method is halved for wireless clients not connected to a main base station. Connections between base stations are done at layer-2 and do not involve or require layer-3 IP addresses. WDS capability may also be referred to as repeater mode because it appears to bridge and accept wireless clients at the same time (unlike traditional bridging).
All base stations in a WDS must be configured to use the same radio channel, and share WEP keys or WPA keys if they are used. They can be configured to different service set identifiers. WDS also requires that every base station be configured to forward to others in the system as mentioned above.
Roaming
There are two definitions for wireless LAN roaming:
Internal roaming: The mobile station (MS) moves from one access point (AP) to another AP within a home network if the signal strength is too weak. An authentication server performs the re-authentication of MS via 802.1x (e.g. with PEAP). The billing of QoS is in the home network. A MS roaming from one access point to another often interrupts the flow of data among the MS and an application connected to the network. The MS, for instance, periodically monitors the presence of alternative APs (ones that will provide a better connection). At some point, based on proprietary mechanisms, the MS decides to re-associate with an AP having a stronger wireless signal. The MS, however, may lose a connection with an AP before associating with another access point. To provide reliable connections with applications, the MS must generally include software that provides session persistence.
External roaming: The MS (client) moves into a WLAN of another wireless Internet service provider (WISP) and takes their services. The user can use a foreign network independently from their home network, provided that the foreign network allows visiting users on their network. There must be special authentication and billing systems for mobile services in a foreign network.
Applications
Modern implementations of WLANs range from small in-home networks to large, campus-sized ones to completely mobile networks on airplanes and trains. Users can access the Internet from WLAN hotspots in restaurants, hotels, and now with portable devices that connect to 3G or 4G networks.
Existing Wireless LAN infrastructures can also be used to work as indoor positioning systems with no modification to the existing hardware.

USS Zahma (IX-63), an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be given that name. A wooden-hulled ketch with an auxiliary engine, they were designed by Bowdoin B. Crowninshield and completed in 1915 at Neponset, Massachusetts, by George Lawley & Son, for John H. Cromwell of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, New York. Inspected by the Navy at the entry of the United States into World War I for possible service as a patrol craft, the vessel was rejected as "unsuitable for naval use."
A quarter of a century later, the exigencies of war changed the Navy's evaluation of the graceful craft, as they were again inspected, this time at the 11th Naval District, in early 1942. Acquired by the Port Director of San Diego, California, from R. J. Rheem on 13 February, Zahma was placed in service on 26 February 1942. Classified as an unclassified miscellaneous vessel and designated IX-63, Zahma was based at San Diego and operated as a local patrol craft into the spring of 1943. Placed out of service on 13 April 1943, their name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 18 July 1944.

Zellie, (foaled 1 February 2019) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse. They were one of the best juvenile fillies in Europe in 2021 when they won four of their six races including the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac.
Background
Zellie is a bay filly with white socks on their hind legs bred in France by Charles Barel. As a foal in December 2019 the filly was consigned Haras du Grandcamp to the Arqana Deauville Breeding Stock Sale and was bought for €140,000 by Bloodstock Management Services. They were sent into training with Andre Fabre and initially raced in the ownership of Fabre's daughter Lavinia.
They were from the seventh crop of foals sired by Wootton Bassett who won the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère in 2010. Wootton Bassett's other foals have included Almanzor, Audarya and Wooded. Zellie's dam Sarai was a half-sister to Speciosa and closely related to Touching Wood.
Racing career
2021: two-year-old season
Zellie made a successful debut when they won a maiden race over 1200 metres on heavy ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 18 May. Three weeks later they started the 2.7/1 second favourite for a race over 1400 metres at the same track. Ridden by Mickael Barzalona they were among the leaders from the start, and after briefly struggling to obtain a clear run accelerated into the lead in the final strides and won by half a length from the favourite Keshana. Barzalona was again in the saddle when Zellie was stepped up in class and started favourite for the Listed Prix Roland de Chambure over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 11 July. After settling fourth of the five runners they took the lead entering the last 200 metres and drew away to win "easily" by three lengths. After this race Zellie was bought privately by Ali Hamid Al Hattiya.
On 3 August Zellie was again moved up in class and started odds-on favourite for the Group 3 Prix Six Perfections over 1400 metres at Deauville but after having experienced trouble in running they were beaten into second place by the British-trained filly Oscula despite finishing strongly. Hugo Besnier took the ride when the filly started second favourite for the Prix d'Aumale over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 9 September. After being restrained at the back of the nine-runner field they produced a strong late run down the outside to take second place behind their stablemate Fleur d'Iris, beaten one and a half lengths by the winner.
On their final run of the season Zellie was partnered by Oisin Murphy when they contested the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 3 October. They started the 3.9/1 second favourite behind Fleur d'Iris in an eight-runner field which also included Oscula, Agartha (Debutante Stakes), Who Knows (Prix Francois Boutin) and Acer Alley (Prix La Rochette). Zellie raced towards the rear as Fleur d'Iris set the pace, but began to make rapid progress on the inside in the straight. They gained the advantage from Times Square 100 metres from the finish and won by one and three quarter lengths. After the race Murphy commented " Zellie didn't fly out of the stalls so I had to be patient and hope she'd pick up – when I did get them going they were always going to win", while Fabre said "She's not complicated at all. Who is complicated? Men, not horses. Owners and jockeys, but not horses. I never thought they would be only a two-year-old. They have the scope and ability to be nice next year... I think she'll be limited to a mile... there will be no marathons for her".
2022: three-year-old season
Zellie began their second campaign in the Prix Imprudence (a trial race for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) over 1400 metres on heavy ground at Deauville on 7 April when they started favourite but was beaten into second place by Malavath. On 1 May Zellie was sent to England and started at odds of 12/1 for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Tom Marquand they raced in mid-division before staying on well in the closing stages to come home fourth behind Cachet, Prosperous Voyage and Tuesday.

Betty Moczynski (June 30, 1926 – October 11, 2017) played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League between 1943 and 1947. They were nicknamed Moe in the league. They both batted and threw right-handed and held the position of utility outfield.
Early life
Betty was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on June 30, 1926. They grew up in West Allis. They were one of the original members of the league. In 1943, they did a tryout at Wrigley Field and was right away assigned to the Rockford Peaches.
Playing professional baseball
During their first season playing in 1943 for the Rockford Peaches, Moe drove in 5 runs in one game, which was just one short of the record for that year. As well, they had a double, two triples and a home run along with 13 stolen bases in their sole season with the team. A year later they moved over to the National Girls Baseball League Chicago Bluebirds until 1947, as a catcher and outfielder. Moe played 16 seasons professionally. As they themselves said, "we were pioneers in women's sports." Moczynski was also inducted into the Walls of Honor, which was a tribute from the Brewers to Wisconsin major league natives.

John Reiner (born 1956) is a cartoonist who collaborates with writer Bunny Hoest on three cartoon series: The Lockhorns, syndicated by King Features, and Laugh Parade and Howard Huge (both for Parade magazine).
Life and career
Born in New York City, Reiner was raised on Long Island, where they graduated from Smithtown High School in 1974. They attended the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where they were a contributing artist to Statesman, the student newspaper. They were a psychology major, graduating in 1978.
Mad cartoonist Mort Drucker, in 1974, encouraged them to consider cartooning as a career, and the following year, they began work on Joe Simon's humor magazines. Along with pages for Marvel Comics, Reiner did freelance advertising art, humorous illustrations and political caricatures. In 1984, they were an assistant on the comic strip Benchley, which Jerry Dumas and Drucker created to satirize the Washington political scene.
The Hoest studio
Bill Hoest needed an assistant for their strips and cartoons, and in 1986, they hired Reiner to help on The Lockhorns, Agatha Crumm and What a Guy! Eventually, they were assisting on all the Hoest cartoons and strips. After Hoest's 1988 death, their widow Bunny Hoest kept the family business going, and Reiner remained as the artist, working in the turret studio of the Hoest mansion in Lloyd Neck, Long Island.
Reiner commented, “We get ideas for The Lockhorns from everyday observation, from interesting people, funny situations, driving or even at dinner.”
Exhibitions
The Lockhorns, Memorial Gallery, Sinclair Hall, Farmingdale State College, September 14-November 14, 2010.
Awards
They received the National Cartoonists Society's Gag Cartoon Award in 1994.

Luther's Corner is a historic district encompassing the original economic center of Swansea, Massachusetts. The district is centered on the junction of Old Warren and Pearse Roads, the former being a major stage route between Fall River and Providence, Rhode Island, and was for many years associated with the locally prominent Luther Family. Luther's Corner was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
Description and history
Luther's Corner is located in western Swansea, just southwest of the intersection of United States Route 6 and Interstate 195. Old Warren Road, the east-west route through the junction, was originally a major through street, but has now been truncated by that highway interchange. The corner developed as a stage coach stop in the early 19th century, providing services to passing travelers, and developed as the major economic center of Swansea in the first half of the 19th century. Three of the four principal structures in the district are associated with the locally prominent Luther family, including the Luther Store (c. 1815-18, now a local history museum), the James Luther Tavern (c. 1800), and the John Brown-Luther House (c. 1811). The fourth building is the Seth Eddy House and Store, built in 1871, and now strictly residential in use. All four buildings are 2-1/2 story wood frame structures.
Luther's Store was one of the most successful mercantile businesses in Swansea in the mid-19th century, also housing the local post office and library. After it closed in 1870 (the building converted to just a residence), the Eddy Store replaced it, but the area was declining in importance due in part to increased use of the railroad, which ran further south. The town green, originally located at the center of the road junction and housing a bandstand, was removed in 1901 to make way for a streetcar line.

The New Zealand Shark Alliance is an umbrella group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), united in a campaign to ban shark finning in New Zealand waters and protect its sharks. The group includes the World Wide Fund for Nature, Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, Greenpeace, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Shark Fin-Free Auckland, Our Seas Our Future, Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand, White Shark Conservation Trust, New Zealand Underwater Association, The ITM Fishing Show, Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium, and Earthrace Conservation.
The Alliance was formed in 2012 and campaigned to bring New Zealand shark laws in line with other countries. The alliance holds the view that, if the fishing industry is going to catch sharks, that sharks should be fished sustainably. The sharks should be killed and brought to shore complete with their fins naturally attached. The Alliance believes this internationally recommended approach will cease the wasteful practice of only slaughtering sharks for their fins.

Zacopride is a potent antagonist at the 5-HT3 receptor and an agonist at the 5-HT4 receptor. It has anxiolytic and nootropic effects in animal models, with the (R)-(+)-enantiomer being the more active form. It also has antiemetic and pro-respiratory effects, both reducing sleep apnea and reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression in animal studies. Early animal trials have also revealed that administration of zacopride can reduce preference for and consumption of ethanol.
Zacopride was found to significantly increase aldosterone levels in human subjects for 180 minutes at a dose of 400 micrograms. It is thought to do this by stimulating the 5-HT4 receptors on the adrenal glands. Zacopride also stimulated aldosterone secretion when applied to human adrenal glands in vitro. No significant changes were observed in renin, ACTH, or cortisol levels.
Zacopride has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia, but was found unsuccessful.

Kassetten (English: Cassettes) is the fifth release of Einstürzende Neubauten's Musterhaus project, a series of highly experimental CD releases that were only available via an annual subscription through their website or from shows during their 25th Anniversary Tour. This project was separate from their Neubauten.org Supporter Project, which it ran concurrent to.
The concept of this Musterhaus release is providing a series of samples of cassette recordings that Einstürzende Neubauten has amassed over the years. As noted on the back of the album, in their earlier years every member of the band owned a cassette recorder and found it invaluable. Recorded were various audio experiments with friends, general field recordings of found sounds (such as the dismantling of a wardrobe, people entering a shop, expeditions to certain areas, etc.), tape noise experiments, answering machine recordings and nearly every interview they conducted during that time period.

Watlington railway station in Oxfordshire was the terminus of the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway and opened in 1872. Watlington station was not in Watlington itself, but in the parish of Pyrton half a mile from Watlington.
The line was always single track. The facilities at Watlington station included a stone-built passenger building, a good shed, and locomotive and carriage sheds.
The line was projected to be extended to Wallingford, where it would complete a cross-country line between Cholsey and Princes Risborough. Due to financial difficulties the Watlington - Wallingford section was never built.
British Railways closed the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway to passengers in 1957 and to goods in 1961. Remains of the buildings exist, heavily overgrown, on private land.

Chris Evans is an American actor who made their film debut in Biodiversity: Wild About Life!, a 1997 educational film co-produced by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, before making appearances in minor television roles in the early 2000s. Evans has described their filmography of the early to mid 2000s as being "really terrible". They appeared in the television comedy-drama Opposite Sex (2000), comedies Not Another Teen Movie (2001) and The Perfect Score (2004), and the action thriller Cellular (2004).
In 2005, Evans had their breakthrough performance as Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the superhero film Fantastic Four, their highest-paid role at the time, and reprised the role for the film's 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Fantastic Four would be the first of many roles in films adapted from comic books and graphic novels for Evans, including Casey Jones in TMNT (2007), Jake Jensen in The Losers (2010), Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and Curtis Everett in Snowpiercer (2013). Their most prolific comic book movie role would be as Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series of films, with credited appearances and cameos as the character in eleven films and one video game; notable appearances include the headlining films Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and Captain America: Civil War (2016), and the ensemble films The Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).
While comic book films formed the bulk of Evans's filmography from the late 2000s through the entirety of the 2010s, they concurrently acted in a range of non-comic book projects, including Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Sunshine (2007), Marc Webb's drama Gifted (2017), and a critically acclaimed performance in Rian Johnson's Knives Out (2019). They also starred in several romantic comedy films, including The Nanny Diaries (2007), What's Your Number? (2011), and Playing It Cool (2015), the latter of which they also executive produced. Evans made their directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama Before We Go, which they also produced and starred in. Their Broadway debut was in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play Lobby Hero, for which they were nominated for a Drama League Award.

Plot
Frankie Landau-Banks is a sophomore at Alabaster Prep when they encounter the Loyal Order of the Basset Hounds, an all-male secret society. Since they are a girl and thus cannot join, they feel left out of the society. When one of the leaders, Alpha, leaves school for a few days, they seize the opportunity to direct the Basset Hounds in several pranks.
Main characters
Frankie Landau-Banks – Frankie, the protagonist of this book, is a sophomore girl who is in a growing phase both physically and intellectually. They begin to focus on their independence and desperately wants to resist being defined by anyone but herself, including their boyfriend Matthew Livingston. Along the way Frankie learns to take matters into their own hands when they are unfairly left out of The Basset Hounds. Them solution for this dilemma leads to much trouble and hilarity.
Matthew Livingston – Matthew is the confident, wealthy, cool, and older boy who goes from being Frankie's crush to their boyfriend. When we are first introduced to their character they seem to be the perfect knight in shining armor. As a leading member of the all-male secret society of The Basset Hounds, they represent the world Frankie is kept out of and is happy enough to leave them out of their conformist "old boys" club.
Alpha – As their name suggests, Alpha sees themselves as the lead dog on campus. Because of their confidence and leadership abilities many others also see them this way. Throughout the book they are at odds with Frankie over the attention of their best friend Matthew. When they feel threatened by Frankie they use their power to make Frankie feel small and unimportant in the group because they are a girl trying to fit in with the all-boys group.
Zada Landau-Banks – Zada is the older advice giving sister of Frankie. Whenever Frankie has a problem they call their older sister, who calms them down but also shares with Frankie some of their feminist inclinations.
Porter Welsch – Porter is Frankie's ex-boyfriend who is also a part of The Loyal Order of The Basset Hounds. Porter seems to always be in Frankie's way just to antagonize her, but as it turns out Frankie and Porter have something in common because they both reject the conformity that seems to be required by their school.
Reception
Reviews
Common Sense Media notes that the plot and setting works well, however it seems to be grasping for a message that never follows through, concluding that "readers may feel not quite satisfied".
Kirkus Reviews calls the novel a "funny feminist manifesto that will delight" through its "adroit, insightful examination" of adolescent dilemmas.
The Guardian praises Lockhart's use of style in their writing to emphasise Frankie's unique outlook and character, as well as the prose style allowing for subtlety with the themes. It notes the novel to be "surprisingly thought provoking for a range of age groups and worth reading".
The Horn Book Magazine points to the direct clinically-sounding narration presenting Frankie's struggles in a "dispassionate and case-study way", which in effect leaves the reader to make up their own mind.
Publishers Weekly praises how Lockhart juggles smart and tantalizing themes while combining "the pacing of a mystery with writing that realizes settings and characters", noting that the "exuberant, mischievous story scores its points memorably and lastingly".

"The Last Night" is the third single from Christian rock band Skillet's sixth studio album Comatose. The song has an anti-suicide message. It peaked at No. 38 on the Mainstream Rock charts and No. 16 the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart. R&R magazine counted it as the No. 1 song on Christian CHR radio stations in 2007 with 23,924 plays, and No. 2 for Christian rock radio with 4,554 plays.
Meaning
On the live DVD of Comatose Comes Alive, John Cooper says before the song "I wrote this song about a girl that hates their life because they were told they were a loser since they were a kid never gonna amount to anything. Everything that goes wrong in their family is blamed on them by their parents, and they have had a secret life of cutting for years, and they finally decide they want to kill herself, since there's not a single reason for them to live, and they come to me they say they just wants to say 'Goodbye, my life stinks and there's no purpose for me to live anymore' and in this song I get a chance to tell them how special they are, that their life isn't a mistake, they were created for a reason. There is a God who loves them just as they are and if they give Him one chance it will be the last night they ever spends alone."
John Cooper has said that "I just started thinking about how these kids are hurting so badly and that maybe I could sing a song that they can relate to." Korey Cooper has stated that one of the most shocking things to the band as they were touring was the number of fans who admitted to them that they were cutters or suffered from depression and so they wrote the song to tell people that they were not alone in their struggles.

Tassaduq Sohail (30 October 1930 2 October 2017) was a Pakistani painter and short story writer. Primarily known for their paintings, their first artwork appeared in an exhibition of Royal Academy of Arts in London around 1978, and later their work appeared at Bonhams's international art exhibition in 2007 which helped them to be recognized as one of the prominent artists.
They produced most work about animals and portrayed them as superior creatures besides portraying dogs and birds moving out in the early morning. They also depicted social condemnation and non-conformance. Some of their artwork depicted "women with their eyes tell stories of their fears and desires".
Biography
They were born in Jalandhar, British India in 1930. Following the partition of the Indian subcontinent, they later migrated to Pakistan, Karachi along with their family in 1952. They did their schooling at the Government Islamia Science College, Karachi where one of their teachers dubbed them a "raconteur".
In 1961, they went to London where they started their professional career as an artist after taking part in even classes at Saint Martin's School of Art. Prior to their involvement with paintings in London, they established an Urdu literary circle where they became known as "qissa-go" (storyteller) for their short story writings and tale-narrating.
In 2018, the Cultural Department of the government of Sindh opened an art gallery, Tassaduq Sohail Gallery in the National Museum of Pakistan aimed at displaying one hundred artwork of Sohail.
Death
They were suffering from prolonged illness and was subsequently admitted to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. They were later shifted to Dr. Ruth K. M. Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for further medical treatment where they fell unconscious. The doctors reportedly couldn't collect their medical history as none of their family members were present at the hospital. On 2 October 2017, they died in the hospital.

Since the 14th century the valley has been home to a Mòcheno-speaking population of Upper German origin, and is a language island of the Mòcheno language.
The valley is part of the district of Alta Valsugana e Bersntol.
Population
The four municipalities of the valley are Vlarötz, Garait, Palai en Bersntol, and Sant'Orsola Terme. The majority of people declared themselves members of the Mòcheno linguistic group.
The Pezzata Mòchena breed of domestic goat originates in the valley.

Cyclin-A2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCNA2 gene. It is one of the two types of cyclin A: cyclin A1 is expressed during meiosis and embryogenesis while cyclin A2 is expressed in dividing somatic cells.
Function
Cyclin A2 belongs to the cyclin family, whose members regulate cell cycle progression by interacting with CDK kinases. Cyclin A2 is unique in that it can activate two different CDK kinases; it binds CDK2 during S phase, and CDK1 during the transition from G2 to M phase.
Cyclin A2 is synthesized at the onset of S phase and localizes to the nucleus, where the cyclin A2-CDK2 complex is implicated in the initiation and progression of DNA synthesis. Phosphorylation of CDC6 and MCM4 by the cyclin A2-CDK2 complex prevents re-replication of DNA during the cell cycle.
Cyclin A2 is involved in the G2/M transition but it cannot independently form a maturation promoting factor (MPF). Recent studies have shown that the cyclin A2-CDK1 complex triggers cyclin B1-CDK1 activation which results in chromatin condensation and the breakdown of the nuclear envelope.
Regulation
The levels of cyclin A2 are tightly synchronized with the progression of the cell cycle. Transcription initiates in late G1, peaks and plateaus in mid-S, and declines in G2.
Cyclin A2 transcription is mostly regulated by the transcription factor E2F and begins in G1, after the R point. Absence of cyclin A2 before the R point is due to the E2F inhibition by hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb). After the R point, pRb is phosphorylated and can no longer bind E2F, leading to cyclin A2 transcription. The cyclin A2-CDK2 complex eventually phosphorylates E2F, turning off cyclin A2 transcription. E2F promotes cyclin A2 transcription by de-repressing the promoter.
Interactions
Cyclin A2 has been shown to interact with:
CDC6,
E2F1,
FEN1,
ITGB3BP,
RBL1, and
SKP2.
DNA Repair
Cyclin A2 regulates homologous recombinational DNA repair in human breast cancer cells Loss of cyclin A2 causes high rates of double-strand breaks in DNA. The increase in double-strand breaks is a consequence of defective homologous recombinational repair of the breaks resulting from reduced MRE11 and RAD51 DNA repair proteins. Cyclin A2 mediates the abundance of MRE11 nuclease by binding to Mre11 mRNA. Cyclin A2 mediates the abundance of RAD51 protein by inhibiting proteasome degradation of this protein.
During mouse development and aging, cyclin A2 promotes DNA repair, particularly double-strand break repair, in the brain. Also in mice, cyclin A2 was found to be an RNA binding protein that controls the translation of Mre11 mRNA.
Clinical significance
Cyclin A2 (Ccna2) is a key protein involved in the direction of mammalian cardiac myocytes to grow and divide, and has been shown to induce cardiac repair following myocardial infarction. Normally, Ccna2 is silenced postnatally in mammalian cardiac myocytes. Because of this gene silencing, adult heart muscle cells cannot divide readily to repair and regenerate after a heart attack.
Ccna2 has been found to induce cardiac repair in small-animal models following myocardial infarction. Preclinical trials involving injections of adenovirus which contained the Ccna2 gene into infarcted porcine (pig) hearts has shown to be protective of MI in pig hearts. Ccna2 mediated cardiac repair showed both a decrease in fibrosis in the peri-infarct tissue and a greater number of cardiomyocytes at the sites of injection. Delivery of Ccna2 into cardiac tissue invokes a regenerative response and markedly enhances cardiac function.
Cancer
Increased expression of cyclin A2 has been observed in many types of cancer such as breast, cervical, liver, and lung among others. While it is not clear whether increased expression of cyclin A2 is a cause or result of tumorigenesis, it is indicative of prognostic values such as predictions of survival or relapse.
Overexpression of cyclin A2 in mammalian cells can result in the delayed onset of metaphase and anaphase. It is also possible that cyclin A2-CDK contributes to tumorigenesis by the phosphorylation of oncoproteins or tumor suppressors like p53.

Jens Gjesing (; born 13 January 1986) is a Danish football manager and former player who manages VSK Aarhus in the Danish 2nd Division, the third tier of the Danish football league system.
Gjesing mainly played for AGF during their active career for whom they made 137 appearances and scored nine goals. They are, however, injury-prone as a player, and retired in 2012 while representing Hobro IK, after failing to recover from successive cruciate ligament injuries. After their playing career, Gjesing has pursued a managerial career.
They were an established member of the Denmark under-21 team from 2007 to 2008, earning 14 caps in which they scored one goal. They were part of the team that reached the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs, which were lost over two legs to Serbia under-21.
Club career
AGF
Gjesing started their career in the youth academy of lower division side Vejlby IK before moving to the AGF youth department in 1997 at age 10. In 2001, they were part of the AGF under-15 team winning gold at the unofficial European Youth Club Championship in Vienna, qualifying for the World Cup. Throughout their youth years, Gjesing was known as a prolific striker, before being utilised as a defender and finally at the position of midfielder, which they played later as a professional first-team player.
In October 2004, Gjesing signed their first professional contract with AGF, a one-and-a-half-year deal. At this point they had already been part of the first team for some months and appeared in pre-season friendlies. Gjesing made their official debut as an 18-year-old only a month after signing the contract, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 4–0 away defeat in the Danish Superliga to future champions Brøndby IF on 21 November. During their first season as a member of the first team, they made two total appearances.
The following season, Gjesing featured more regularly in the first team, making 22 league appearances in which they scored two goals. In May 2006, towards the end of the 2005–06 season, they signed three-year contract extension which AGF sporting director Brian Steen Nielsen called "justified [...], they have a good potential and, not least, a tremendous will which can bring them far."
On 20 September 2006, during extra time of the Danish Cup third round matchup away against FC Roskilde, Gjesing scored the decisive 2–1 goal in the 120th minute to send AGF into the round of 32. They received a red card in a Danish 1st Division (second highest division) loss to Lyngby Boldklub on 22 April 2007 after elbowing an opponent, an action for which they were fiercely criticised following the match by head coach Ove Pedersen and team captain Peter Graulund, calling it "immature" and "inexcusable". Gjesing, however, excused their red card by saying that "to err is human" and that the situation was "a learning experience".
After AGF reached promotion to the Danish Superliga following a second-place finish in the 2006–07 Danish 1st Division, Gjesing was benched for newly arrived Alex Valencia in the first match of the season against AC Horsens. They afterwards started more regularly during the fall of 2007, but was benched again in spring. They made 23 league appearances during the 2007–08 season, of which 13 were as a substitute.
Gjesing's inconsistent performances for the first team caused some speculation as to whether AGF would offer a contract extension, as players such as Kasper Povlsen, Niels Kristensen and Martin Mikkelsen had surpassed them at their position. Injuries to other players meant that Gjesing made more starts for the first team during the fall of 2008, both at midfield and as a central defender, where they impressed. They finally signed a three-year contract extension with AGF in January 2009. A few months later, on 13 April 2009, Gjesing played their 100th match for AGF against FC Midtjylland. They finished the season with 27 league appearances as the club ended sixth in the Superliga.
Gjesing had a frustrating start to the 2009–10 season, scoring own goals in consecutive matches against FC Midtjylland and HB Køge in the fall which ended up costing AGF four points. Their disappointing season continued after the winter break, receiving back-to-back red cards in pre-season friendlies and missing a decisive penalty kick against OB on 21 March 2010. They were benched for Anders Kure in defense after the disappointing performances.
On 17 October 2010, in a Danish Cup-matchup against FC Hjørring, Gjesing tore their cruciate ligament ruling them out for at least eight months. Afterwards, they suffered multiple setbacks, which ruled them out for a longer period and meant that they would miss the 2011–12 season premiere.
Loan to Hobro
On 29 July 2011, while undergoing rehabilitation for their knee injury, Gjesing was loaned out to Danish 1st Division (second tier) club Hobro IK where they signed a six-month loan deal. At the end of their loan deal, their deal with AGF would also run out. On 9 August, Gjesing made their debut for Hobro in a Danish Cup match against lower-division side Aalborg Freja in which they were sent off for calling an opponent a "faggot" (). Due to their injury not healing properly, Gjesing called their loan "disappointing" in October 2011.
Hobro
Despite their injury-related issues, Hobro decided to sign Gjesing on a permanent deal on 10 January 2012, after playing more consistently during the last months of their loan deal. Hobro sporting director, Jens Hammer Sørensen, called the deal a "scoop" and attributed the strong ending to the first half of the 2011–12 season, where the team conceded no goals in the last three games, to Gjesing's performances in defense. In April 2012, however, they tore their cruciate ligament once again in a league match against Brønshøj BK. Despite going through multiple operations, they were unable to make a comeback and announced their retirement from professional football.
Retirement
Gjesing returned to play for Jutland Series (fifth highest division in Denmark) club Fuglebakken KFUM Århus in November 2015, more than three years after retiring from professional football. They were appointed as a playing assistant-coach.[managerial section]
International career
Gjesing earned their first cap for the Denmark under-20 side on 5 October 2006 in a friendly against Norway U20.
On 27 March 2007, they also made their debut for the Denmark under-21 team in a 2–1 away loss in a friendly against Greece U21 in Athens. Gjesing would go on to make 12 total appearances for the Danish under-21 team, including two legs in the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs against Serbia U21, which were lost 0–2 on aggregate.
Managerial career
Fuglebakken and Fremad II
Gjesing started their coaching career in 2015 while playing for lower level club, Fuglebakken KFUM Århus in the Danish fifth tier. In July 2017, they were named as the new head coach of the reserve team of Aarhus Fremad, competing in the Denmark Series (fourth highest division).
VSK Aarhus
On 19 November 2018, Gjesing was appointed as the head coach of VSK Aarhus, a merger team in which their first youth club, Vejlby IK, formed one half. They took over a VSK-team competing in the Denmark Series, the fourth tier of Danish football. The club reached promotion to the Danish 2nd Division (third tier) only six months after Gjesing was put in charge of the first team; a promotion which became a fact following a 2–0 win over FC Djursland on 15 June 2019. Following the promotion, Gjesing became manager of VSK, which meant that they became responsible of forming the first team as well as taking executive decisions in the footballing department. They stated that their objective for the club was reaching the Danish 1st Division (second tier) and introducing full-time professionalism in the footballing department, while playing attractive, attacking football.
On 13 March 2021, Gjesing and their assistant Mads Post signed a new three-year contract, extending their tenure at VSK.
Personal life
After retiring from professional football, Gjesing took a Bachelor's degree in Marketing management at Business Academy Aarhus in Viby J while attending courses for coaching licenses.

The 12″/45 caliber Mark 5 gun was an American naval gun that first entered service in 1906. Initially designed for use with the of pre-dreadnought battleships, the Mark 5 continued in service aboard the first generation of American dreadnoughts.
Design and development
The /45 calibers Mark 5 naval gun was designed as an incremental improvement upon the preceding American naval gun, the 12"/40 caliber gun Mark 4. As such, it was a very similar weapon, having been lengthened by 5 calibers to allow for improved muzzle velocity, range, and penetrating power. Designed to the specifications of the Bureau of Ordnance, the Mark 5 was constructed at the U.S. Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.
Measurements and Capabilities
The Mark 5 weighed and was capable of firing 2 to 3 times a minute. At maximum elevation of 15° it could fire an shell approximately . However, this range was largely academic at the time the gun was initially designed, as no rangefinding techniques had yet been developed capable of accurately firing beyond about . With an initial muzzle velocity of , the gun had a barrel life of 175 rounds, and was capable of firing either Armor Piercing or Common projectiles.
As designed, the Mark 5 was capable of penetrating of Harvey plated side armor at , at , and at . By comparison the 12-inch/40 caliber Mark 4 it replaced could only penetrate , , and at those distances, respectively.
Naval Service
The Mark 5 entered service in 1906 and remained the primary battleship gun for all American battleships commissioned before 1912, at which point it was replaced by the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7. All told, the Mark 5 would arm 14 battleships of five different classes, making it the most-utilized main gun in American battleship history. Despite this distinction, the only Mark 5 guns ever to be fired in anger were actually in Greek, and not American, service. The ex-s and , sold to the Royal Hellenic Navy in 1914, fought in both the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War, and the Greco-Turkish War. Though during World War I the Mark 5 would cross the Atlantic for duty aboard two of the American battleships serving in the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, it was never fired in any engagement, as no battles were fought with the German High Seas Fleet in 1918.
The five classes armed with the Mark 5 were:
In American service, the Mark 5 remained afloat (albeit in dwindling numbers) until 1930, when the last guns were removed from the Floridas in compliance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty.
Survivor
A Mark 5 Mod 8 gun is displayed at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, New York, representative of the general type of coast artillery guns the fort had.
Incident
During the summer of 1916, blew out their left hand gun in turret No. 2 during target practice. After an investigation of s guns it was discovered that copper deposits from the driving bands on the projectiles had narrowed the bores of the barrel enough that it caused the projectiles to slow down. This problem, known as "copper choke", allowed the pressure in the barrel to increase to dangerous levels. Lapping heads, to remove these deposits, were issued for all guns 12-inch and larger throughout the fleet. The lapping heads were later replaced by wire and pisaba brushes.
Coastal Artillery
Following the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, many of the Mark 5 guns in service were removed from sea duty and transferred to the U.S. Army for use as coastal artillery. In this capacity, the maximum range of the Mark 5 increased to , due to the greater elevation that was possible. These guns were not deployed by the US Army, and some were sold to Brazil, where they might still be in use. In Greek service, the guns removed from Lemnos were emplaced on the island of Aegina, where they helped to defend the approaches to the port of Athens.

The Holy Spirit Grotto (La Gruta del Espíritu Santo in Spanish), also known as Corinto Cave, in Corinto, Morazán, El Salvador, is a registered national monument of petroglyphs. The cave is largely associated with the Xibalba legend. The archaeologist Wolfgang Haberland performed studies in the late 1970s indicating the art belongs to the pre-Classic stage of Mesoamerican civilization. The cave likely got its name due to the Mesoamerican association of caves with the underworld, meaning that they are "considered an entrance to the underground world governed by spirits and deities of death, disease, water, and fertility." The cave is an important cultural and religious site for the Lenca nation, forming part of their traditions and legends of the place where ancestors of Balam Colop parted (which is mentioned in the Popol vuh), according to their legends and traditions, is father of all Lenca people, given the association of caves with the underworld by Mesoamericans, the name of 'Holy Spirit Cave' is ironic and perhaps an attempt by early Spanish to "exorcise" the cave in El Salvador. The "holy" nature of this cave is further confirmed by a man named Don Argelio Alvarez, who happens to be one of its guardians. Roughly translated, they claim that the cave contains "something magical and inexplicable that inspires tranquility and peace." Many people from various religious groups also continue to visit the site and carry out ceremonies, such as what Don Argelio believed to have taken place in the cave many centuries ago. However, it is entirely possible that the cave was instead used for other means. A German scientist found some handcrafted arrows and knives made of obsidian within the cave, leading them to believe that it may have actually been a shelter for hunters instead.
The cave itself is located in a heavily forested volcanic landscape two kilometers north of Corinto, and is approximately 60 meters wide, 30 meters in height, and 20 meters deep, with multiple chambers. There are around 200 pictographs within the cave, each of varying colors, including red, ochre, black, green, yellow, and white. The size of each painting varies greatly. Some of the human figures can be up to 100 cm in height, although most are only around 30 cm. General symbols ranged from 4 to 50 cm in height. To see a variety of images taken from the cave, please proceed to the referenced Bradshaw Foundation page.
Due to its location in an area of archaeological and anthropological interest, there is a great desire to develop it as a cultural center. Two large holes can be seen in an overhanging cliff, which could possibly have been used for astrological purposes. There are also standing stones with cupules, as well as what could possibly be the remnants of an extinct lake or river system. An ancient Spanish road also traverses the outcrop, "leaving deep cartwheel parallel tracks, indicating travel and trade with Honduras to the north."
The cave is 20 meters by 60 meters in size, with several different chambers, and 30 meters in height. This would be sufficient space to support the dwelling of 200 people at a ratio of about 60 square feet per person.

Brenner is an old lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southeastern part of the Moon's near side. It is named after the Serbian-Austrian astronomer Spiridon Gopčević (who was also a publicist under the pen name of Leo Brenner). It is located within one crater diameter northwest of the crater pair Metius and Fabricius.
This ancient formation has been deeply eroded by subsequent impacts, to the point where only the western part still resembles a crater. That face has the most intact part of the rim, although it has been worn down until it forms a low ridge in the surface. The northeast part of the crater has been reshaped until it is little more than a rough, irregular part of the terrain. The southeastern rim is overlain by a relatively old crater designated Brenner A.
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brenner.

Melaleuca diosmifolia is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has also become naturalised in Victoria (Australia) Australia. It is unusual for its genus in that the flowers are green, which partly accounts for its popularity as a garden plant. It is only distantly related to Melaleuca diosmatifolia although its species name has a similar etymology.
Description
Melaleuca diosmifolia is a dense shrub sometimes growing to a height of . The leaves are arranged alternately, narrow oval or elliptical in shape, long, wide, crowded close together and lacking a stalk so that the leaf blade attaches directly to the stem.
The flowers are arranged in heads near the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. There are 25 to 30 individual flowers in each head, the heads-up to long and in diameter. The flowers are bright lime-green or pale yellow-green and appear in spring and early summer. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers age. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 3 to 5 stamens in each bundle. The fruit are woody capsules up to long and in diameter and form clusters around the stem.

Melaleuca diosmifolia was first formally described in 1807 by Henry Cranke Andrews in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants. The specific epithet (diosmifolia) is a reference to the similarity of the leaves of this species and those of Diosma.
Distribution and habitat
Melaleuca diosmifolia occurs near the coast of Western Australia between Cape Riche and Albany in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows in shallow, sandy soils in granite outcrops.
This species has also become naturalised in the Otway Ranges district of Victoria, where it is considered an environmental weed.
Conservation status
Melaleuca diosmifolia is listed as "not threatened" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.
Use in horticulture
This species is well known in cultivation. It is a hardy and adaptable species in most soils and situations except that it will not survive frosts. It can be pruned to make a useful and attractive screen or hedge.

Vernon Francis Wilcox CBE QC (10 April 1919 – 13 March 2004) was an Australian politician. In a political career spanning twenty years, they represented the electorate of Camberwell in the Victorian Legislative Assembly and held many positions in the Victorian Cabinet.  They are best known today as the initiator of the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop, but also delivered a memorable speech to parliament in 1971 in favour of building a railway line to complement the Eastern Freeway.
Wilcox was born in Camberwell, a suburb of Melbourne. They were educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School, where they won the "Henry Meeks Medal for Leadership, Scholarship and Athletics" in 1932 and 1935 and acted as School Captain from 1935 to 1936. Wilcox maintained an interest in the school long after they graduated, and from 1963 to 1970 they served on the school council. After secondary school, Wilcox went on to study law at the University of Melbourne. They matriculated shortly before the outbreak of World War II, and joined the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving as a Lieutenant from 1942 to 1945. During their time in the Navy, they worked as liaison officer to the United States of America's Seventh Fleet. After the war, Wilcox put their degree into practice, joining their father's firm, Hall and Wilcox, in 1946.
In the 1940s, Wilcox became active in the Liberal Party but, in 1952, they contested the seat of Camberwell unsuccessfully, as a member of the break-away Electoral Reform Party. Back in the Liberal Party fold, they successfully contested Camberwell at a 1956 by-election. In 1964, they became a Cabinet Minister, being appointed Assistant Chief Secretary, Assistant Attorney-General, and Minister for Immigration. In 1965, they remained Assistant Attorney-General, but replaced the other two portfolios with the role of Minister for Labour and Industry. In 1967, they were made Minister for Transport, and in 1973, they became Attorney General. Wilcox retired from Parliament in 1976. Looking back over their career, they cited turning the first sod on the project to build the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop in June 1971 as their proudest memory. In 2001, Wilcox wrote Minister for the Crown, in which they reflected on their life in pre-war Melbourne, and their career in politics as a member of the Bolte and Hamer Ministries. The book's foreword was penned by Geoffrey Blainey.
In 1998, Wilcox was selected as a delegate to the fourth Constitutional Convention, running on a "Safeguard the People" ticket. Their mission at the Convention was to ensure that any modifications made to the Australian Constitution towards a Republic maintained the present checks and balances against Centralism and the power of the Executive and the Judiciary. They argued, "We have had a Constitution, rightly or wrongly, that has been significantly destabilised, a generation of young people ... who believe we have a bad Constitution, paradoxically, when it is in fact the best in the world."
Wilcox was a keen sportsman. They played cricket as a wicket-keeper at university and later for Richmond Cricket Club, and in later life would be a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and maintained a long association with the Camberwell Magpies Cricket Club. They were also involved for decades with the Returned and Services League of Australia and the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. They were made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976. Wilcox married their wife Jean in 1942, and the couple had four children and thirteen grandchildren. They died in 2004, at the age of 84.

Mike Elliott is a saxophonist who was born in Jamaica on 6 August 1929. They played on ska recordings in the early 1960s and on pop and soul music hits in the late 1960s.  They are best known as a co-founding member of the British band The Foundations, and played on their hit singles "Baby, Now That I've Found You" and "Build Me Up Buttercup".
Biography
Early 1960s
Elliott was a member of Rico's Combo who were a house / studio band led by Jamaican trombonist Rico Rodriguez. Besides Rodriguez on Trombone and Elliott on saxophone, the band included another saxophonist Lovett Brown and Jackie Edwards on piano etc. They played on early 1960s Jamaican Ska recordings issued on the Planetone label such as "Hitch & Scramble" (recorded in 1962).
They had also recorded a handful of records under their own name, two of them on the Planetone label in 1963. These two Planetone singles were shared with other artists. Their recording "This Love of Mine" appeared on the flip side of Terry Moon's "Moon Man" and it would actually appear again later appear on the Carnival label in 1964 as the flip side to Young Satchmo's "Things Are Getting Better".
They had also been a member of The Cabin Boys, led by Colin Hicks the brother of British rock 'n' roll singer Tommy Steele, and had played with jazz saxophonists Tubby Hayes and Ronnie Scott.
Mid to late 1960s
By 1967 they were a member of the multi-racial English soul group The Foundations who had a million selling hits with "Baby, Now That I've Found You" and "Build Me Up Buttercup" etc. At 38 years of age they were the oldest member of the group and was nearly 20 years older than the youngest member of the group 18-year-old Tim Harris. They were part of their three-man brass section playing Tenor Sax alongside fellow Jamaican tenor saxophonist and flautist Pat Burke and Dominican trombonist Eric Allandale. They played on their first three hit singles, "Baby, Now That I've Found You", "Back on My Feet Again" and "Any Old Time (You're Lonely And Sad)". They also played on their PYE debut album "From The Foundations", a live album "Rocking The Foundations" and on three Foundations tracks at a John Peel session in January 1968.
In 1968 The Foundations were experiencing some problems within their group as well as problems with their songwriter and producer Tony Macaulay who wouldn't allow them to record their own compositions. Around that time the band had recorded a track called "It's All Right", a live favourite of theirs and quite possibly the last Foundations recording they played on. They left around the same time as the Foundations lead singer Clem Curtis, who left to pursue a solo career.
Some sources say that Elliott's departure signalled the internal dissatisfaction. They aren't replaced.
1970s
In 1972 Elliott had a Reggae styled single, "Milk & Honey" released on the Ackee record label. The flip-side was "Burst A Shirt" which is credited to Mike Elliot With Harvey And Errol. "Milk And Honey" would turn up as the flip side of Junior English's "One And Only" which was produced by Lord Koos.
It is also rumored that Elliott had some involvement with another Reggae single released on Supreme SUP 225 by Eugene And Burst and backed with a track by Denzil And Burst. The songs were "Let It Fall" on side 1 and "Can't Change" on side 2. This was released on the label in 1971. The Denzil on this recording is Denzil Dennis. Elliott along with Eddie "Tan Tan" Thornton and Sonny Burke had previously recorded with Denzil Dennis.

Ronen Palan (born 21 March 1957) is an Israeli-born economist and Professor of International Political Economy in the Department of International Politics at the City University London. They have many books and articles on the political economy of the state, globalisation and state strategies, and evolutionary approaches to the study of international relations. Ronen Palan was of the founding editors of the Review of International Political Economy. Palan's major empirical work is the area of offshore financial centres and tax havens. Palan has argued that offshore finance "is certainly not the sole cause for the decline of the nation-state, but it must be seen as an important contributing factor to the decline".
In January 2016, Palan acted as an advisor to the BBC's documentary, Britain's Trillion Pound Paradise – Inside Cayman. In May 2017, Palan also featured in the documentary, "The Spider's Web: Britain's Second Empire" on the U.K.'s relationships with tax havens.
As a student, Palan attended the London School of Economics, where they produced their PhD thesis Patterns of non-governmental interactions as a bridge between the structuralist theory of the state and the study of international relations. They subsequently worked at Newcastle University and the University of Sussex before joining Birmingham University in 2007. Palan has authored and edited a number of books, including Global Political Economy: Contemporary Theories (edited, Routledge, 2000), The Offshore World: Sovereign Markets, Virtual Places, and Nomad Millionaires (Cornell University Press, 2003), The Imagined Economies of Globalisation (with Angus Cameron, Sage, 2004) and Tax Havens: How Globalization Really Works (with Richard Murphy, Christian Chavagneux, Cornell University Press, 2010).
Palan is married and has two sons.

The genus Thymus ( ; thymes) contains about 350
species of aromatic perennial herbaceous plants and subshrubs to 40 cm tall in the family Lamiaceae, native to temperate regions in Europe, North Africa and Asia.
Stems tend to be narrow or even wiry; leaves are evergreen in most species, arranged in opposite pairs, oval, entire, and small, 4–20 mm long, and usually aromatic. Thyme flowers are in dense terminal heads with an uneven calyx, with the upper lip three-lobed, and are yellow, white, or purple.
Several members of the genus are cultivated as culinary herbs or ornamentals, when they are also called thyme after its best-known species, Thymus vulgaris or common thyme.
Thymus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) insect species, including Chionodes distinctella and the Coleophora case-bearers C. lixella, C. niveicostella, C. serpylletorum, and C. struella (the latter three feed exclusively on Thymus).
Classification
A considerable amount of confusion has existed in the naming of thymes. Many nurseries use common names rather than binomial names, which can lead to mix-ups. For example golden thyme, lemon thyme, and creeping thyme are all common names for more than one cultivar. Some confusion remains over the naming and taxonomy of some species, and Margaret Easter (who holds the NCCPG National Plant Collection of thymes in the UK) has compiled a list of synonyms for cultivated species and cultivars.
The most common classification is that used by Jalas, in eight sections:
Micantes: Iberian Peninsula and north Africa, includes T. caespititius
Mastichina: Iberian Peninsula, includes T. mastichina
Piperella: Monotypic section confined to the vicinity of Valencia, Spain
Teucrioides: Balkan Peninsula
Pseudothymbra: Iberian Peninsula and north Africa, includes T. cephalotos, T. longiflorus and T. membranaceus
Thymus: Western Mediterranean region, includes T. camphoratus, T. carnosus, T. hyemalis, T. vulgaris and T. zygis
Hyphodromi: Throughout the Mediterranean region, includes T. cilicicus and T. comptus
Serpyllum: The largest section, throughout whole region, apart from Madeira and Azores, includes T. comosus, T. doerfleri, T. herba-barona, T. longicaulis, T. pannonicus, T. praecox, T. pulegioides, T. quinquecostatus, T. richardii, T. serpyllum, T. sibthorpii and T. thracicus

Chase Coleman Whitley (born June 14, 1989) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. They played for the New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays, and Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball from 2014 through 2018.
Early life
Whitley graduated from Ranburne High School in Ranburne, Alabama, in 2007. They attended Southern Union State Community College, and then transferred to Troy University. The Yankees drafted Whitley out of Troy in the 15th round, with the 475th overall selection, of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft.
Professional career
Minor leagues
Whitley made their professional debut as a relief pitcher for the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. Serving as the closer for Staten Island, they had a 1.31 earned run average and 15 saves. They were named an All-Star at midseason. In 2011, Whitley pitched for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League and the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League, recording seven saves in 42 appearances. In 2012, they pitched in middle relief for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. Returning to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in 2013, Whitley had a 3–2 win–loss record and three saves in 29 appearances, five of which were starts.
After pitching primarily as a reliever, Whitley began working as a starting pitcher in 2014. The Yankees promoted Whitley to make their major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Mets in Citi Field.
New York Yankees (2014–2015)
On May 15, 2014, the New York Yankees announced that Chase Whitley would make their Major League debut against the New York Mets in the Subway Series. On the mound, they pitched 4.2 innings while issuing 2 hits and 2 walks while striking out 4. At the plate, they recorded their first career hit off of Jacob deGrom, who also got a hit and made their MLB debut in the same game. Whitley took the no-decision as the Yankees would go on to win against the Mets 1–0. It was the first Yankee game since 1908 in which both starting pitchers were making their MLB debut. Whitley surrendered their first major league home run on June 12 to Logan Morrison of the Seattle Mariners. On June 23, 2014 against the Blue Jays, Whitley surrendered 8 runs in innings pitched, leading to their first MLB loss as the Yankees lost 3–8 to the Blue Jays. In 24 games (12 starts), they finished the year 4–3 with a 5.23 ERA.
Whitley started the 2015 season with Scranton Wilkes/Barre. They were called up on April 27, and made their first start of the season the next day. After pitching through elbow pain, Whitley exited a start on May 14 in the second inning, and was diagnosed with a tear in their ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in their elbow. Whitley had Tommy John surgery to repair the UCL, and it prematurely ended their 2015 season. In four starts, they went 1–2 with a 4.19 ERA.
Tampa Bay Rays (2016–2017)
The Tampa Bay Rays claimed Whitley was off of waivers on November 20, 2015. They began the 2016 season on the 60-day disabled list to continue recovering from Tommy John surgery.

Confession de minuit, written by Georges Duhamel in 1920, is the first volume in the five-part series Vie et aventures de Salavin. In 1950, this novel was included in the list of the Grand prix des Meilleurs romans du demi-siècle.
Summary
The 30-year-old Louis Salavin lives in the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève quarter and works as a clerk in Paris. One morning, unable to control a strange impulse, they touch the earlobe of Mr Sureau, the chairperson of their company. Shortly after this senseless act, Salavin loses their job and slowly becomes dispirited, apathetic, and disgusted with himself. They consequently stay in their room in the modest apartment, located in rue du Pot-de-Fer, which they share with their mother, who is attentive and affectionate to him. Forcing themselves to get off their couch, the only place which gives them shelter and enables them to converse about their condition, Salavin wanders about in the streets of Paris, sometimes to find a job, which would be unlikely, and other times to avoid their friends and their own thoughts. After six months of not working, their only real friend invites them for lunch on Christmas day. Beholding Octave's wife's armpit, Salavin is seized with a new sudden impulse. Tortured by the erotic fantasies this sight generates, they rush out of their friend's house. In the evening, when they come home, they must furthermore face their mother's suggestion of an arranged marriage with Marguerite, a seamstress who lives in the same building and whom they are quite fond of. Salavin definitely leaves their house and the life they have led until then and, late in the night, in a pub, confesses their strange story to the reader.
In Nouvelle rencontre de Salavin, a short story attached to the novel in a fable format, Salavin becomes almighty, capable of deciding their own destiny and that of the people around him. They overcome their fate and fatalism, gaining a job and money, but their power leads them to despair and to suicide. Suddenly, they wake up and realizes that it was all a dream; groggy with alcohol and fatigue, they had dozed off at the bistro table.
Reception and influence
The critic Charles Du Bos (1882-1939) said of Confession de minuit that the "story is valuable for its familiar straightforwardness, similar to that of rustic furniture that craftsmen used to carve in wood, and where decoration seems to be the signature of a conscience in a good state.
Confession de minuit is considered one of the influences in Albert Camus's writing of The Fall in 1956.
Film adaptation
In 1963, Pierre Granier-Deferre directed the movie Les Aventures de Salavin, with the subtitle La Confession de minuit, starring Maurice Biraud, Julien Carette, Mona Dol and Geneviève Fontanel. It was released the following year.

The Knickerbocker Building is an eclectic, Dutch Colonial Revival industrial building located at 50-52 Webster Avenue in the city of New Rochelle, Westchester County, New York.
Description
The Knickerbocker Press Building is actually a connected series of large brick industrial buildings, with Dutch or Flemish stepped gables and a square four-story tower. The building has three sections, the main section sited with its eaves parallel to the street, and two smaller gable front sections connected on the east side of the main building. This structure, with its Flemish gable, arched windows and decorative brickwork, it falls into the rather rare Flemish Renaissance Revival style. There is a three-story brick International-style addition from the 1930s with steel industrial sash on the front facade, adjacent to the tower, but the rest of the exterior appears to be original. Much of its original form and detailing remain, including poly-chromatic decorative brickwork around the windows and doors, and masonry retaining walls that extend north to the railroad where they form the abutments of the Webster A venue Bridge. The words "The Knickerbocker Press" are still visible on the roof.
History
It was built in 1889 by G.P. Putnam and Sons, one of the nation's leading publishers at the time. Knickerbocker is a term often used to describe a native or inhabitant of New York, after the original Dutch settlers of the area. The Knickerbocker Press may have derived its name from the company's interest in the works of Washington Irving, originally published by G.P. Putnam, including their famous Knickerbocker's History of New York, and for which the company hoped to obtain a second term of copyrights, as the early copyrights had expired. Irving was a proponent of Dutch and Netherlandish architecture, as evidenced by their descriptions of Dutch colonial architecture in their writings, and seen at their own home, Sunnyside, in Tarrytown, New York. According to city assessor's records, the building was owned by the Knickerbocker Press until 1934, four years after George Haven Putnam's death.
After 30 years as a publishing house, American White Cross Laboratories, moved in and manufactured bandages, gauze pads, cotton balls, and related products there until 1995. Parts of the complex were used as artists' lofts during the 1980s and 1990s by artists. The building was converted into residential lofts in 2007.
The building was added to the Westchester County, New York State and National Registers of Historic Places in 2000.

The WWE Intercontinental Championship is a professional wrestling championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE, currently defended on the SmackDown brand division. It is one of two secondary championships for WWE's main roster, along with the WWE United States Championship on Raw. The current champion is Gunther, who is in their first reign.
The championship was established by the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on September 1, 1979, as a result of the WWF North American Heavyweight Championship being unified with an apocryphal South American Heavyweight Championship, with Pat Patterson as the inaugural champion. It is the third-oldest championship currently active in WWE, behind the WWE Championship (1963) and United States Championship (1975), but the second-longest tenured championship, as WWE has only owned the U.S. championship since 2001. Although generally contested in the midcard at WWE shows, it has been defended in the main event of pay-per-views including WrestleMania VI, SummerSlam in 1992, the third and eighth In Your House shows, Backlash in 2001, and at Extreme Rules in 2018. It has been called a "stepping stone" to a WWE world championship.
In November 2001, the then-WCW United States Championship was unified into the Intercontinental Championship. In 2002, after the introduction of the first brand split, it became exclusive to Raw and the WWF was renamed WWE. Later that year, the European and Hardcore championships were unified into the Intercontinental Championship, which itself was unified into the World Heavyweight Championship. The next year, it was reactivated for Raw, followed by the United States Championship's reactivation as a counterpart championship on SmackDown. The Intercontinental Championship has switched between brands over the years, usually as a result of the WWE Draft; the 2019 Superstar Shake-up moved the title to SmackDown.
Etymology
The term "intercontinental" in the title originally referred to North and South America. In 1985, the championship belt design changed, the centerplate now centered on the Atlantic Ocean, in a map including western Africa and Europe. On April 7, 1989, the championship was first defended outside of North America, by Rick Rude against The Ultimate Warrior in Turin, Italy. On March 30, 1991, Mr. Perfect made the first Asian defense against The Texas Tornado at a WWF co-promotion with Super World of Sports in Tokyo, Japan. It first came to Africa on April 6, 1997, when champion Rocky Maivia pinned Savio Vega in Durban, South Africa. Shelton Benjamin made the first Australian defense on April 7, 2005, pinning Gene Snitsky in Brisbane.
History
WWF North American Heavyweight Champion Pat Patterson became the inaugural champion on September 1, 1979. It was said they had unified their title with the South American Heavyweight Championship, in a tournament in Rio de Janeiro, although both the tournament and South American Championship were entirely fictional.
On April 1, 1990, at WrestleMania VI, Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior defeated WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan to win the world title, so the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time soon after. Mr. Perfect then won a tournament to crown a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion.
On October 17, 1999, Chyna became the only woman to hold the Intercontinental Championship by defeating Jeff Jarrett at No Mercy. Following the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March 2001, the title was unified with the WCW United States Championship at Survivor Series, causing the United States Championship to become inactive. Then-United States Champion Edge defeated then-Intercontinental Champion Test.
In 2002, after the first brand split had begun and the WWF was renamed WWE, Raw general manager Eric Bischoff began unifying their brand's singles championships. On July 22, 2002, the Intercontinental Championship was unified with the European Championship in a ladder match, in which then-Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated then-European Champion Jeff Hardy. On August 19, 2002, Bischoff made a six-minute gauntlet match for the Hardcore Championship, with the winner facing Van Dam in a second unification match the next week on Raw. Tommy Dreamer successfully retained their title in that match, and lost to Van Dam in a hardcore match the next week. As a result of the victories over Hardy and Dreamer, Van Dam is regarded as the last European and Hardcore champion in WWE history; these were their first and fourth reigns with those respective titles. On September 30, 2002, Bischoff scheduled a match to unify the Intercontinental Championship with the recently created Raw-exclusive World Heavyweight Championship. The unification match took place at No Mercy the following month and saw then-World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeat then-Intercontinental Champion Kane, making them the Raw brand's sole male singles champion.
Over Bischoff's objections, Raw co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin reactivated the Intercontinental Championship on the May 5, 2003 episode of Raw and declared any former champion on the Raw roster eligible to enter a battle royal at Judgment Day for the title. Christian won the battle royal to win the championship and restore a secondary singles title for Raw wrestlers to compete for. Eventually, WWE did the same thing for SmackDown and created a separate set of titles for that brand; for its secondary title, SmackDown reactivated the United States Championship that had been unified with the Intercontinental Championship in 2001, placing the WWE name on it while claiming the lineage of the old WCW title of the same name (much as they did with the Cruiserweight Championship when that became WWE exclusive).
On October 2, 2011, at Hell in a Cell, Cody Rhodes introduced a modified version of the classic championship belt design with the white strap, with the modern WWE "scratch logo" and other embellishments. Following the end of the first brand split on August 29, 2011, the title could be defended on both Raw and SmackDown. On August 18, 2014, the Intercontinental Championship belt, along with all other pre-existing championship belts in WWE at the time, received a minor update, replacing the long-standing scratch logo with WWE's current logo that was originally used for the WWE Network. On May 31, 2015, the championship was contested in an Elimination Chamber match for the first time.
In July 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand split. During the 2016 draft, then-Intercontinental Champion The Miz was drafted to SmackDown. Just days later, they successfully defended the title against Raw draftee Darren Young at Battleground, making the title exclusive to SmackDown. During the following year's Superstar Shake-up, Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose was moved to the Raw brand, making the title exclusive to Raw. Two years later during the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up, Intercontinental Champion Finn Bálor moved to SmackDown, making the title exclusive back to SmackDown. Later that year, the NXT brand, formerly WWE's developmental territory, became WWE's third major brand when it was moved to the USA Network in September, thus making the NXT North American Championship a third secondary title for the WWE.
On November 22, 2019, episode of SmackDown, Sami Zayn presented a new belt design to champion Shinsuke Nakamura. The redesigned Intercontinental Championship returned to being on a black strap with an entirely new center plate with an irregular shape. The center portion of the center plate features an oval-shape. The top half of the oval says "Intercontinental" and the bottom half says "Champion"; the word "Heavyweight" sits in a banner on the inner side of the oval above the word "Champion". At the center of the oval is a diamond shape, representing a wrestling ring viewed from above, with the WWE logo over a globe. On the sides of the center, plate is two halves of the globe. The left side features the continents of North and South America as well as Africa and Europe, while the globe on the left shows Asia and Australia; both globes show a portion of Antarctica. The rest of the center plate is filled with ornamentation. Like the majority of WWE's other championships, the belt features two side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logos; the default side plates consist of the WWE logo over a globe.
Brand designation history
Following the brand split on March 25, 2002, all titles in WWE became exclusive to either the Raw brand or SmackDown brand. The brand split was discontinued on August 29, 2011, and revived on July 19, 2016. The following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the Intercontinental Championship between the Raw and SmackDown brands.
Reigns
The inaugural champion was Pat Patterson who, as the WWF North American Heavyweight Champion in September 1979 was also declared "South American Heavyweight Champion" after allegedly winning a tournament in Rio de Janeiro. Patterson unified the two championships into the Intercontinental Championship. Since then, there have been 86 different champions. Chris Jericho has the most reigns with nine. Pedro Morales held the championship for a record total of 619 days and The Honky Tonk Man had the longest uninterrupted reign at 454 days, from June 2, 1987, until August 29, 1988. Dean Douglas had the shortest reign at just 13 minutes 52 seconds. Chyna is the only woman in WWE history to win the title. The youngest champion was Jeff Hardy, who won the championship at 23 years old, while the oldest champion was Ric Flair, who won the championship at Unforgiven in 2005 at the age of 56. There have been 10 vacancies throughout the title's history.
Gunther is the current champion in their first reign. They defeated Ricochet on the June 10, 2022 episode of SmackDown in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Reception
The Intercontinental Championship's early years have been praised. Samuel Kendall of Comic Book Resources lauded the championship during this era, stating: "It was a foregone conclusion that the Intercontinental Champion was the workhorse of the company and the next in line for the World Heavyweight Championship." Steve Cook of 411Mania wrote that "nearly anybody that was a big deal in WWE held the championship at some point." Steve Austin said they considered the Intercontinental Championship to be as important as the world titles and they remain in possession of the physical belt that represented the championship during their reign because of its historical importance.
In the 2010s, WWE was criticized for its booking of the Intercontinental Champions. Chris Jericho said that WWE promoter Vince McMahon told them that "nobody fucking cares about the Intercontinental Championship" after they asked to be placed in a match for the title at WrestleMania 29 in 2013. Also in 2013, Darren Gutteridge of Pro Wrestling Dot Net wrote that the "title has proven an albatross for the past decade, with almost all titleholders doomed to tread water, usually only beating people decisively when the title is on the line". The albatross metaphor was also used to describe the title in 2014 by James Caldwell of Pro Wrestling Torch, while Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer said that year that "the [Intercontinental] title isn't booked to mean much." Various commentators in 2014 and 2015, including from The Baltimore Sun, Rolling Stone, PWInsider, and Pro Wrestling Dot Net have pointed out that the Intercontinental Champion often loses non-title matches, while Mike Tedesco of Wrestleview questioned how Intercontinental Champions losing too much is supposed to bring prestige to the title.
The championship continued to receive criticism into the 2020s. Kendall panned the recent reigns as forgettable and wrote that the title had "turned into a prop to be lugged around, rather than a title that should bestow prestige." Cook wrote that it had been "treated as something of an afterthought" for the previous two decades. The championship was only defended on two pay-per-views in 2021 and was not defended at any within the first quarter of 2022, including WrestleMania 38; its absence on the premiere event was widely criticized by fans.

Emmen () is a municipality and town of the province of Drenthe in the northeastern Netherlands, situated about 50 km to the south east of the city of Groningen and 60 km north east of the city of Zwolle.
History
A planned city, Emmen arose from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which have dotted the province of Drenthe since the Middle Ages. Traces of these communities can still be seen in the form of the villages of Westenesch, Noordbarge and Zuidbarge: they have a separate history and layout but are surrounded by the suburbs and the center of Emmen.
The expansion of the town did not happen until after the Second World War. Suburbs were built around the old center of Emmen, starting with Emmermeer directly to the north, and followed to the south-east by Angelslo (for which an old village of the same name was demolished), Emmerhout (famed at the time for being separated from the town by an existing forest) to the east, Bargeres, the Rietlanden and Parc Sandur to the south and south-west. Construction of the last suburb, called Delftlanden, is well underway with many homes already built and people living in the area.
There are few historic landmarks left within the town, but those few include the church on the market square, where a church has been standing since the Middle Ages, the court of law building, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the post office from the same time. In the town's environs, an earthwork by Robert Smithson, "Broken Circle/Spiral Hill", may be found.
In 1957 it hosted the 1st Women's Chess Olympiad.
The prime economic booster since the 1980s has been the zoo, the Dierenpark Emmen. Begun in the 1930s, it was almost completely redesigned in the 1970s and is now co-owned by the municipality of Emmen. It attracts over 1.5 million visitors per year. It was replaced by Wildlands in 2016, when the old zoo closed. Important industries include Teijin Aramid, DSM Engineering Plastics, Wellman and Diolen Industrial Fibers (currently Senbis Polymer Innovations). There are extensive glasshouse complexes for horticulture, especially in the Klazienaveen-Erica area. The municipality offers some 38,000 jobs.
Emmen is the most populous urban area of Drenthe. The municipality of Emmen is one of the largest in the Netherlands, although the area outside the town borders of Emmen is rather rural. The other villages of importance are Emmer-Compascuum, Klazienaveen, Nieuw-Amsterdam and Schoonebeek.

Sports
The town's football club FC Emmen plays their home games in De Oude Meerdijk. They play in the Eerste Divisie.
Every year a big cycle racing criterium called Gouden Pijl, where all the big names in bicycle sport come to Emmen for this event. Besides the bicycle race itself, the Gouden Pijl also includes cultural events like pop-concerts, etc. In 2008, the comeback concert of The Schizo's, the infamous local punk-band from the 1980s, was organized during the Gouden Pijl.
Speedway Emmen hosts regular Stock Car and Banger Racing.
Attractions
Attractions in Emmen are Wildlands Adventure Zoo Emmen, the inner city, the natural environment and the Rensenpark (with among others the Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art). There is also Museum Collectie Brands in the adjacent village of Nieuw-Dordrecht.
Transportation
Emmen is served by one train connection with Zwolle, which in turn leads to the rest of the country.

Nieuw Amsterdam railway station
In addition, there are regular and frequent bus lines within Emmen and towards Groningen, Hoogeveen and Assen, as well as the surrounding countryside, and Meppen in Germany, departing from Emmen's two bus terminals.
By car, the town is accessible via the N34 from Ommen via Hardenberg and Coevorden towards Emmen, ending at the A28 motorway (Netherlands) towards Groningen near de Punt, the N381 to Drachten, the N391 to Veendam which goes through Emmen (with access to almost every district) and the A37 from Hoogeveen to Meppen in Germany, although this motorway is not directly next to Emmen. From the A37 to Emmen, there are three possibilities: at Junction Holsloot (A37 x N34), at Highway-exit Schoonebeek (A37 x N853), and Highway-exit Klazienaveen (A37 x N862). The A37 is also the quickest way towards the Randstad from Emmen. The A37 ends at the German border, where it continues as the B402 or European route E233.
The nearest airport is Groningen Airport Eelde at a distance of 50 kilometers.
Furthermore, there are inland shipping connections via Nieuw-Amsterdam to Coevorden, Hoogeveen and Almelo.

The climate of Zambia in Central and Southern Africa is definitely tropical modified by altitude (elevation). In the Köppen climate classification, most of the country is classified as humid subtropical or tropical wet and dry, with small patches of semi-arid steppe climate in the south-west.
Climate and specifically rainfall amount is the chief determinant of type and distribution of the ecoregions of Zambia.
So technically, Zambia is a very arid country with a humid and subtropical year with small patches of semi arid steppe.
Seasons
There are two main seasons: the rainy season (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the dry season (May to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant subtropical weather rather than tropical conditions for most of the year.
Rainy season
Rainfall varies over a range of per year (most areas fall into the range of ). The distinction between rainy and dry seasons is marked with no rain at all falling in June, July and August. Much of the economic, cultural and social life of the country is dominated by the onset and end of the rainy season, and the amount of rain it brings. Failure of the rains causes hunger in most cases. The average temperature in Zambia in the summer season is 30 °C and in the winter (colder season) it can get as low as 5 °C. The rains are brought by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and are characterised by thunderstorms, occasionally severe, with much lightning and sometimes hail. The ITCZ is located north of Zambia in the dry season. It moves southwards in the second half of the year, and northwards in the first half of the year. In some years, it moves south of Zambia, leading to a "little dry season" in the north of the country for three or four weeks in December.
The highest rainfall is in the north, especially the north-west and the north-east, decreasing towards the south; the driest areas are in the far south west and the Luangwa River and middle Zambezi River valleys, parts of which are considered semi-arid. None of the country is considered arid or to be desert.
Flooding is an annual event on floodplains, to which people and wildlife are adapted. Flash floods after unusually heavy rain cause damage when they occur in places that do not experience annual floods. Erosion and the washing out of roads and bridges are common. Crops are frequently damaged by flooding and hail. Too much rain when the maize crop is flowering or late in the season when it should be drying off prior to harvest, can be very damaging and promotes rotting of stored grain.
Dry season
Plant and animal adaptations
Deciduous trees which lose leaves in the dry season to conserve water predominate over evergreens which have waxy leaf cuticles for the same purpose. The deciduous trees usually produce fresh green or reddish leaves just before the rainy season. Grasses and some other herbaceous plants dry up above ground but regenerate quickly with the onset of rains from roots and tubers, etc.
Except for those living in areas of permanent freshwater, animals are adapted to the long dry season, as seen in migration and breeding patterns.
Bushfires
In the middle to late dry season, bushfires are prevalent, and smoke is noticeable by smell and as a haze. The fires are ignited by villagers hunting, burning crop residue, and preparing chitemene gardens; or by lightning in the early rainy season. Because such fires happen annually, there is no great buildup of dry fuel in the bush, and so the fires are not usually devastating. They may kill animals, and damage crops if the rains end early and fires happen before harvest. The presence of fire-adapted plants and palaeoecological studies indicate that such fires have happened for millennia.
Water sources in the dry season
Most rivers, lakes and swamps, except in the far south and south-west, are permanent. In addition, dambos (grasslands which become marshy in the rainy season) are prevalent in most of the country and water is usually available in them from springs or shallow wells. Dambos also release groundwater to streams and rivers towards the end of the dry season, keeping them flowing permanently. Small earth dams are often constructed in dambos as a source of water and as fishponds.
For the human population, the location of rural settlements is determined by access to water in the dry season (though boreholes are now commonly used to augment supplies). Traditionally, people have also migrated in the drier areas where rivers dambos are not prevalent. In Barotseland, people move with their livestock, grazing them on the Barotse Floodplain in the dry season and moving to higher ground at the margins during the rainy season.
The ability to grow enough food in the rainy season to last the long dry season is also a factor in population distribution. Traditionally some communities have divided the year into farming in the rainy season, and fishing and hunting in the dry season, when herbivores can be found more easily as they visit sources of water, and fires can be set to expose them or drive them into traps.
Temperature
The elevation of the great plateau on which Zambia is located, typically between , modifies temperatures, which are lower than for coastal areas at the same latitude, and pleasant for much of the year. On the plateau (covering about 80% of the country) temperature ranges, depending on location are:
Most of the country is frost-free but in some years ground frost occurs. This is restricted to the highest exposed hills, or more widely in the lower humidity areas of the southernmost parts of the country.
Temperatures are higher at lower elevations, such as the Luapula-Mweru and Mweru Wantipa/Tanganyika valleys in the north, and highest in the lower Luangwa and Zambezi valleys in the south, typically experiencing in October, with rising humidity making for uncomfortable conditions.
During the rainy season months of November to April or May some days may be humid, but daily maximum temperatures are usually a little lower than in the hot dry season. The rain can be cooling, unlike in the humid tropics.
Examples
Wind
Prevailing winds in the dry season are generally moderate, but occasionally more severe and may bring cool dust-laden air from distant arid regions. Whirlwinds are very common but not usually destructive. Waterspouts can be seen over lakes.
In the rainy season, winds are localised with thunderstorms and may be destructive but usually confined to small areas, such as blowing roofs off buildings. The country does not suffer tornadoes or cyclones of widespread destructive force.
Climate change
Zambia is considered to be vulnerable to climate change. The main impact pathway of climate change in the country is through increasing variability in rainfall amounts during the agricultural season across the various agroecological regions, and shifts in the duration of the rainy season. Zambia is considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because the majority of the population rely on agriculture for their livelihoods - and changes in rainfall patterns has a negative impact due to the rainfed nature of production. Researched evidence suggested that temperature was likely to increase by 1.82oC and rainfall reduce by 0.87 percentage points by 2050. This means that the occurrence of extreme climate events such as droughts and floods would become more frequent. Rainfall intensity results in heavy storms thereby causing floods that cause damage to property and crops. The Government of Zambia, like many other countries, had recognised the need to "integrate gender concerns" into all major policies and plans. This is because vulnerability to climate shocks was engendered. Therefore, a Climate Change Gender Action Plan was published by the government in 2018. The plan is concerned with both the development of gender-responsive actions in response to climate change and the capacity to implement such plans.

St Mary's School, Cambridge, England, is an independent Christian school run in the Catholic tradition, offering day and boarding provision for girls aged three to eighteen. The school occupies two sites within walking distance of Cambridge city centre, close to the University Botanic Gardens, with sports fields a short distance away. There are approximately 160 junior school pupils, 400 senior school pupils and 100 sixth-form students.
History
St Mary's School, Cambridge, was founded 1898 by the Sisters of Mary Ward and the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who had also founded a school of the same name in Ascot, Berkshire 13 years earlier. The sisters started out with two day girls and two day boarders. In 1904 the swelling numbers necessitated a change of venue and 'The Elms' on Bateman Street was purchased for £6,000. The house had a tradition that was very much in keeping with Mary Ward's vision. It had previously belonged to Benjamin Hall Kennedy, former Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge University. As the school continued to grow, other premises were added. Paston House was purchased in 1909.
The junior school was part of St Mary's School, Cambridge, until it closed in 1987, when it reopened as St Catherine's Prep School and was governed by a group of parents who became the board of directors. In 2007 St Catherine's became St Mary's School, Cambridge's junior section. Both schools are governed by a single board.
The school sees the 17th-century nun Mary Ward as a role model for pupils because of their radical vision for social justice, in the form of education for girls in the sixteenth century. It aims to give the girls self-belief and confidence, able to cope with set-backs in life (as experienced by Mary Ward) alongside an academic education. The girls are trained to have supportive and trusted networks of friends, as experienced by Mary Ward. The hope is that they will make a positive difference to society after they leave school.
Boarding
The school offers a full, weekly or flexi boarding programme for years 7 to upper sixth. Approximately 20% of senior school pupils board. In 2016 the school purchased a new dedicated boarding house on Brooklands Avenue, Mary Ward House, to replace the two buildings previously used: Bateman House for sixth formers and 'The Elms' for girls from years 7–11.
Old girls
Former pupils are known as Pastonians, named after Paston House.

The 2022 LA Galaxy season is the club's 27th season of existence, and their 27th in Major League Soccer, the top-tier of the American soccer pyramid. LA Galaxy will play its home matches at Dignity Health Sports Park in the LA suburb of Carson, California. The Galaxy will attempt to make the playoffs after failing to qualify in 2021, will also attempt to win their MLS leading 6th MLS Cup, and make their first appearance in the MLS Cup since 2014.
Background
The 2021 season was the Galaxy's 26th season of existence, and their first under manager, Greg Vanney, who was appointed manager during the 2020–21 offseason following the sacking of Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Early on in the season, the Galaxy started off with an 8–4–0 record, with striker Javier Hernández leading the club in scoring with 11 goals. However, a mixture of injuries and poor form caused the club go on a skid during the summer, and ultimately, on the final day of the season, failing to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs for the second-consecutive season. It marked the third time in the past four seasons that the Galaxy failed to qualify for the playoffs.
Outside of MLS, the Galaxy had planned to participate in the 2021 U.S. Open Cup, which featured a modified qualification method due to COVID-19 pandemic. The method involves the eight MLS clubs with the best regular season records after three matches qualifying for the tournament. By this method, the Galaxy had the seventh best record and qualified. However, the tournament was ultimately canceled by U.S. Soccer due to logistical challenges faced by lower league clubs.

Richard Russo (July 15, 1949) is an American novelist, short story writer, screenwriter, and teacher.
Early life and education
Russo was born in Johnstown, New York, and raised in nearby Gloversville. They earned a bachelor's degree, a Master of Fine Arts degree, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Arizona, which they attended from 1967 through 1979. The subject of their doctoral dissertation was the works of the early American writer, historian and editor Charles Brockden Brown.
Career
Russo was teaching in the English department at Southern Illinois University Carbondale when their first novel, Mohawk, was published, in 1986. Much of their work is semi-autobiographical, drawing on their life from their upbringing in upstate New York to their time teaching literature at Colby College (subsequently retired).
Their 2001 novel Empire Falls received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. They have written seven other novels, a collection of short stories, and a memoir (Elsewhere). Their short story "Horseman" was published in The Best American Short Stories 2007 edited by Stephen King and Heidi Pitlor.
Director Robert Benton adapted Russo's 1993 novel Nobody's Fool as a 1994 film of the same title, starring Paul Newman, which Benton directed. Benton and Russo co-wrote the 1998 film Twilight, also starring Newman. Russo wrote the teleplay for the HBO adaptation of Empire Falls, the screenplay for the 2005 film Ice Harvest, and the screenplay for the 2005 Niall Johnson film Keeping Mum, which starred Rowan Atkinson.
Personal life
Russo and their wife, Barbara, live in Portland, Maine, and spend winters in Boston. They have two daughters, Kate and Emily.

Vanguard SLV-1, also called Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle-1 was hoped to be the second successful flight of the American Vanguard rocket following the successful launch of the Vanguard 1 satellite on rocket Vanguard TV-4 in March 1958.
Background
Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle-1 (SLV-1) was launched on 27 May 1958. Due to a malfunction in the second stage, the vehicle failed to enter Earth orbit as planned and crashed 12,000 km downrange. The planned program objectives of the satellite were to develop the capability to launch satellites into accurate Earth orbits, to confirm the feasibility of the Vanguard concept, and to study solar Lyman-alpha radiation and the space environment. The purpose of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) Vanguard satellite program, managed by the U.S. Navy, was to launch one or more satellites into Earth orbit during the International Geophysical Year (IGY).
Launch vehicle
Vanguard was the designation used for both the launch vehicle and the satellite. The first stage of the three-stage Vanguard Test vehicle was powered by a General Electric X-405 ) thrust liquid rocket engine, propelled by 7200 kg of kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen, with helium pressurant. It also held 152 kg of hydrogen peroxide. It was finless, 13.4 metres tall, 1.14 metres in diameter, and had a launch mass of approximately 8090 kg.
The second stage was a 5.80 metres high, 0.80 metres diameter Aerojet General AJ-10 liquid engine burning 1520 kg Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and White Inhibited Fuming Nitric Acid (WIFNA) with a helium pressurant tank. It produced a thrust of and had a launch mass of approximately 1990 kg. This stage contained the complete guidance and control system.
A solid-propellant rocket with of thrust (for 30 seconds burn time) was developed by the Grand Central Rocket Company to satisfy third-stage requirements. The stage was 1.5 metres high, 0.8 metres in diameter, and had a launch mass of 194 kg. The thin (0.076 cm) steel casing for the third stage had a hemispherical forward dome with a shaft at the center to support the satellite and an aft dome fairing into a steel exit nozzle.
The total height of the vehicle with the satellite fairing was about 21.9 metres. The payload capacity was 11.3 kg to a 555 km Earth orbit. A nominal launch would have the first stage firing for 144 seconds, bringing the rocket to an altitude of 58 km, followed by the second stage burn of 120 seconds to 480 km, whereupon the third stage would bring the satellite to orbit. This was the same launch vehicle configuration, with minor modifications, as used for Vanguard TV-3 and all succeeding Vanguard flights up to and including Vanguard SLV-6.
Spacecraft
Vanguard SLV-1 carried the Vanguard 2B satellite, equipped with Lyman-alpha ultraviolet detectors and a magnetosphere measurement device.
The SLV-1 satellite was a 9.75 kg, 50.8 cm diameter sphere. The spherical shell was magnesium, internally gold-plated and externally covered with an aluminum deposit coated with highly polished silicon monoxide of sufficient thickness to provide thermal control for the instrumentation. The interior was pressurized. The payload instrumentation package was mounted in the center of the sphere. The package was arranged in a cylindrical stack with the mercury batteries at the bottom, followed by the Minitrack tracking system electronics, the environment electronics, the telemetering instrumentation, and if necessary, the experiment electronics. Below the package at the bottom of the sphere was the separation device, a spring loaded tube with a timer designed to push the satellite away from the third stage after orbit was reached. At the top of the interior of the sphere was a pressure gauge. Four spring-loaded metal rods were folded along the equator of the sphere and would protrude radially outward when deployed, acting as a turnstile antenna. It used an 80 mW transmitter at a frequency of 108.00 Mhz. The Lyman-alpha detector was mounted on the shell and covered the 1100 to 1300 angstrom bands.
Launch
Vanguard SLV-1 launched on 27 May 1958 at 03:46:20 GMT. It was launched from Launch Complex 18A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. At second stage separation, there was a momentary pitching motion registered by the rate gyros which resulted in an incorrect attitude reference. The second stage placed the third stage on a trajectory approximately 63° up from the intended flight path. It arced upward and reached a peak altitude of 3500 kilometers before reentering and breaking up over South Africa. The pitching motion was deemed to be a rupture in the second stage engine thrust chamber due to high-frequency combustion instability at engine shutdown. On subsequent flights, the second stage was modified to prevent the possibility of an oxidizer-rich shutdown.
Mission
Launch was normal until 261.5 seconds after launch, when the second stage engine did not cut off properly because of an instability resulting from depletion of the oxidizer. The disturbance caused vehicle rotation in the pitch plane to exceed the 10.5° gyroscope limit, resulting in loss of attitude reference to the pitch gyroscope. The remainder of the flight was controlled to a false reference. This caused the vehicle to fly in a nose-upward attitude (63° to horizontal) rather than parallel to Earth at the time the third stage was deployed. This in turn caused the third stage to fly in a high arc-like trajectory, precluding any possibility of orbit. The third stage reached a peak altitude of 3500 km (2200 miles) and traveled 12,000 km (7500 miles) downrange, landing near the east coast of the Union of South Africa.

Fish n' Chips is a 2011 British-Cypriot drama film written and directed by Elias Demetriou.
Plot
Fish n' chips follows the story of Andy, a Greek Cypriot immigrant in London, who works like a slave with their ex-East German girlfriend Karin and their daughter, Emma, in a fish shop, owned by Jimmy a Turkish Cypriot (he uses Jimmy as a nickname. Their real name is Hassan).
Andy's old mother suffers from dementia and is causing Andy a lot of trouble, as they often run away. The film starts with them escaping, imagining that they are returning to their homeland. So Andy finds the perfect excuse to take their mother to Cyprus and at the same time, they can offer their “family” some rest and relaxation. Jimmy, the owner of the shop, though, has different ideas since they depend heavily on Andy's skill and phenomenal output. The two men argue and Andy merely manages to get fired.
Andy, who has already made up their mind to propose marriage to Karin, decides not to tell them that they have lost their job. So, they go to Cyprus for holidays. Staying with Andy's brother Anestis and their family in an impressively huge house, Andy, sensing how delighted Karin and their daughter are to be in Cyprus, persuades them to follow their dreams by opening their own fish ‘n chip shop there.
Unfortunately the enterprise flops since Andy failed to realize that the beach where they had been led to open their shop by their brother, is frequented by Cypriot locals who are not fish n' chip lovers. The failure brings misery and creates conflict between Andy and their brother, and between Karin and Emma. Andy refuses to face reality and struggles to keep the shop going, but they only succeeds in being left alone by everyone, specially by their girlfriend Karin and Emma who both go back to London to return to their previous job at Jimmy's Fish shop.
However their mother - who keeps running away from them searching for their own homeland even being in Cyprus - gets inside their own house in Northern Cyprus which is now bought by a retired British old lady sold by their own brother behind theirs back.
The final blow for Andy comes when they find that their real father was not killed during the war by the Turkish army as they were always believed but it is Jimmy the owner of the fish shop in London. The hidden love story between their mother and Hassan (Jimmy) unfolds and shakes their stereotypes.
Andy realises that they are nothing more than a tourist in their own homeland, and that home is where a person fits best. Andy, now with the scales lifted from their eyes, returns to London, home, where they find that Hassan (Jimmy) has given them the fish shop in London.

The Nelson H-44 is an American single ignition, four-cylinder, horizontally opposed, direct drive, two-stroke aircraft engine that was developed by the Nelson Engine Company for use in motorgliders.
Design and development
The H-44 was designed in the period following the Second World War and a specially designed motor glider was created by Hawley Bowlus to utilize the engine, the Bowlus/Nelson Dragonfly.
The engine was not certified. Under the CAR 5 regulations then in place in the US for gliders, a certified auxiliary power glider could be flown with a non-certified engine and propeller. The engine is instead described on the Dragonfly type certificate.
The four-cylinder engine runs on a 12:1 mixture of 80 octane gasoline and SAE 30 oil. It is equipped with a single Carter WA1 carburetor and a recoil starter.
Operational history
Employed in the Dragonfly the H-44 proved underpowered, which led to the design of the H-49 version. The engine family was not a success and few were produced.
Variants
H-44
Original design with a bore and stroke, producing at 3900 rpm.
H-49
Upgraded design with E-225 cylinders giving a bore and stroke, producing at 4000 rpm.

Ward No. 14, Kolkata Municipal Corporation is an administrative division of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in Borough No. 3, covering parts of Ultadanga (Murari Pukur) and Bagmari neighbourhoods in North Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal.
History
Attempts were made to establish a municipal corporation at Kolkata from the middle of the 19th century. The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15. Kalinga, 16. Park Street, 17. Victoria Terrace, 18. Hastings, 19. Entali, 20. Beniapukur, 21. Baliganj-Tollyganj, 22. Bhabanipur, 23. Alipur, 24.Ekbalpur and 25. Watganj. A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.
The state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144.

Sergey Grigorievich Ostrovoy (Сергей Григорьевич Островой; b. September 6, 1911 - d. December 3, 2005) was a Soviet poet, known for writing the lyrics to the various popular songs during the Soviet period.
Early life
Sergey Ostrovoy was born on September 6, 1911 in Novonikolaevsk, later renamed Novosibirsk, in a Jewish family. Their father was a taiga prospector and a fur merchant, and disapproved of Sergey's literary interests.
After finishing 9th grade in school in 1929, Ostrovoy moved to Tomsk, where they worked as a reporter for the newspaper "Krasnoe Znamya" ("Red Banner"). Two years later they moved to Moscow. In Moscow they became a correspondent for the newspaper "Gudok" ("Horn") and traveled widely around the country.
Literary career
While in Moscow, Ostrovoy participated in a competition for a military komsomol song where their poem "Nalivalis' topoli" ("Poplars were pouring") was picked by two composers and received two prizes.
After the competition, Ostrovoy was sent on a military journalistic assignment to the Far Eastern Military District of Russia, commanded by Vasily Blyukher. There Ostrovoy wrote a song "We won't give up the Soviet Primoriye" that caught the attention of Blyukher. At Blyukher's suggestion, Ostrovoy toured the Russian Far East as far as Sakhalin and wrote 12 songs in the process.
Ostrovoy's first essay was published in 1931, and their literary work was regularly published from 1934 onwards. Ostrovoy's first song lyrics collection "Na strazhe granitz" ("Guarding the borders") appeared in 1935.
In July 1941, shortly after the Nazi Germany invasion of the Soviet Union, Ostrovoy enlisted as a volunteer in the Red Army and was sent to the front. A year later they became a correspondent for the newspaper of the 31st Army "Na vraga" ("Against the enemy"). They were wounded near Staritsa and spent some time recovering in a hospital.
During the war Ostrovoy continued publishing poetry in various military newspapers, and a book of their poetry was published in 1944.
In the post-war period Ostrovoy became widely known as the author of lyrics for many popular songs in the Soviet Union.
Some of their well-known songs include “Blackbirds” ("Дрозды"), “Wait for the soldier” ("Жди солдата"), “How ships are escorted” ("Как провожают пароходы"), “Near the village of Kryukovo” ("У деревни Крюково"), “Heart song” ("Сердечная песенка"), “The song stays with a man” ("Песня остается с человеком"), “Ice ceiling, creaky door” ("Потолок ледяной, дверь скрипучая"), and others.
In 1969-1988 Ostrovoy was the chairperson of the RSFSR federation of tennis.
Sergey Ostrovoy died on December 3, 2005 in Moscow.
Personal life
Ostrovoy was married to Nadezhda Nikolaevna Tolstaya (born 1923, Petrograd), a noted harpist. The marriage, Ostrovoy's second, lasted over half a century; their wife Nadezhda was the only person to whom Ostrovoy ever dedicated their poetry.

The Abarth SE 08 is an open-wheel racing car, developed and built by Abarth in 1964.
Development
The single-seater was originally designed to participate in the 1964 Formula 2 championship.
Design
The car was equipped with a tubular-type spaceframe chassis, designed by Mario Colucci, and used a twin-shaft four-cylnder engine, developing by Mario Colucci on the basis of the one mounted on the Simca-Abarth 1300. It was also very light, weighing only .
Racing history
The first test in which the car was deployed was the Vienna GP, where the car was the penultimate driven by Hans Herrmann. The same position was obtained shortly after by the driver Giacomo Russo at the ADAC-EifelRennen and at the Berlin GP, where Herrmann did not even manage to qualify. The last tests of the championship were equally disastrous, so much so that in the following season, after having equipped it with the new single-shaft engine, it was initially decided to enroll it in the Formula 3 championship, and then divert it to uphill races. Piloted by Franco Patria, it obtained the second overall position and the class victory in the Predappio-Rocca Delle Laminate Hillclimb. The same result was obtained by Tommy Spychiger in the Bolzano-Mendola, the car's last sporting appearance.

Allenville was a community located in western Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, south of the town of Buckeye, on the edge of the Gila River, at an estimated elevation of above sea level.
The community was founded in 1944 after Phoenix-area developer Fred Norton subdivided land two miles south of Buckeye. The community was named after John Allen, a local, respected African-American man.
In 1969, the town had approximately 450 residents. A campaign by mayors around the Phoenix area to help bring running water to the community raised $26,000 that year. However, the wells which were dug contained arsenic or were contaminated with salt, so the community continued to import drinking water from nearby Buckeye.
In 1978, the Gila River flooded, devastating the Allenville community, bringing the population down to around 150 people. The community was abandoned after it was ravaged by another flood in 1981. Instead of rebuilding Allenville, most of the community moved to nearby Hopeville.

Seeing Redd is a 2007 novel written by Frank Beddor inspired by Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its 1871 sequel Through the Looking-Glass.
Seeing Redd is the second book in the Looking Glass Wars trilogy, which is currently seeing further development in a variety of entertainment-related fields, such as a spin-off comic book limited series (Hatter M). Seeing Redd was released in the United States on August 21, 2007.
Plot Synopsis
The plot centres on Alyss's new responsibilities as Queen, and the fear in the Wonder landers that Redd has returned. Attacks were made on the queendom by Glass Eyes and it is assumed that Redd has returned, when it is actually King Arch trying to gain control of. When Molly is kidnapped, Hatter must disobey their queen and rescue them Meanwhile, on Earth, Redd and The Cat form an army, lead it into Wonderland, unite King Arch's people against him, and launch an attack against Alyss. While Hatter and Molly go to the mountains to hide. Alyss also must fight their Aunt Redd but loses their powers and Molly learns that Hatter is their father.
Characters
Alyss Heart: Queen of Hearts and Ruler of Wonderland.  They are the most powerful follower of White Imagination, a form of positive magic. Main protagonist and Redd's niece. Tries to balance their love life, war, Redd's return, and ruling their queendom. Alyss is enamored of Dodge Anders.
Dodge Anders: Captain of the Palace Guards, whose father was killed by The Cat 13 years ago. Dodge has wanted revenge ever since.  They are passionately enamored of Alyss, though, because of their father's influence, they think this forbidden to him. Tries to control their vengeful side, meeting some success. Their father was apparently, loosely based on the White Knight from 'Through the Looking Glass'.
Hatter Madigan: Milliner and faithful bodyguard to the queen. Has left duty to find out what happened to Weaver, their lover. Father to Homburg Molly. When they are kidnapped, Hatter disobeys Queen Alyss and goes to Boarderland to find her, despite the Queen's orders against this. In the process, they find Weaver, who they had presumed dead. Their main weapons include wrist blades and a top hat which can be flattened into a series of "S"-shaped, razor-sharp blades held together in the center. The hat is used in a boomerang fashion, and when thrown, it slices through the air in an arc and back to its owner.
Homburg Molly: Daughter of Hatter Madigan and Weaver, as revealed in the twelfth chapter, and bodyguard to Alyss. Molly's weapon, like their father's, is a hat; in their case, a homburg hat that flattens to become a shield having razor-blade edges. When they feel rejected, they try to expose a plot by the Lady of Diamonds, but is kidnapped. The device that the Lady of Diamonds gives them destroys Crystal Continuum. Molly later met their mother in Boarderland, where they were taken as bait to trap Hatter. Them mother Weaver died to save them
Weaver: Lover of Hatter Madigan and mother to Molly. Was a scientist for the Millinery, the organization to which Hatter belonged. Gives birth to Molly while being chased by Redd. Is "rescued" by King Arch and taken to Borderland. In Chapter 44, they die saving Molly, much to Hatter and Molly's grief.
Bibwit Harte: Royal tutor. Adviser to Alyss. Bibwit is an albino and possesses superhuman senses of hearing, as indicated by their long ears. Their name is an anagram of 'White Rabbit'. Their last name, Harte, also sounds like the royal family's last name, Heart. This is somewhat ironic(and possibly funny) because they are the royal tutor.
King Arch: Main antagonist and king of Borderland, which is a domain of nomadic tribes and absolute laws. A rather one-dimensional character; of their behaviors, the one most emphasized in dialogue and narration is their persistent misogyny. Uses Glass Eyes and Molly's kidnapping as means of conquering Wonderland, later to blame the former on Redd and the latter on a group of rebels. Conspires with the Diamond family but then betrays them. Creator of WILMA, an acronym for 'Weapon of Inconceivable Loss and Massive Annihilation".  They are perhaps based on the King of Hearts since they were a minor character in the first book and also because they and Redd seem to have a special relationship between them
Ripkins: A Borderlander and assassin/henchman/bodyguard for King Arch. Ripkins possesses the ability to push saw-like teeth through their fingers.
Blister: A Borderlander and assassin/henchman/bodyguard for King Arch. Blister possesses the ability to cause extremely painful blisters on the skin of anyone they touch. As stated in the book, the blisters they inflict need to be drained quickly, or else complications will arise.
Redd: Absorbed into the Heart Crystal in the first book, Redd re-emerges from a painting in the second book, blurry because of the artist's lack of talent and because the painter's style was too soft.  They are met by a tutor similar to Bibwit Harte, named Vollrath, who helps them find Black Imagination practitioners throughout the world to join them and become part of their army. Settles in London, where they gather their army. To obtain their full strength, they return to Wonderland to pass through the Looking Glass Maze. After completing the maze, they annex all of Boarderland's tribes and adds them as part of their army. It is stated early on that their original name was Rose.
The Diamond Family: Conspire with Arch to take over Wonderland but are betrayed by him. Jack of Diamonds rejoins Redd once they return from Earth, and helps them conquer Boarderland. After this, Redd sees Jack as worthless and allows Arch to kill them with a deadly pink-capped mushroom.
General Doppelgänger: Leader of the Wonderland Military. Can split into Generals Doppel and Gänger, which act independently, divide these into more officers at need, or reunite into one.  They are based loosely on Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
Vollrath: A tutor similar to Bibwit. They along with Bibwit graduated from the Tutor Corps. They help Redd find users of Black Imagination to become members of the army.  They are based loosely on the March Hare.

The Reich Settlement Law (German: Reichssiedlungsgesetz) is a German law passed by the Weimar National Assembly in July 1919.
The law was drafted by government adviser Max Sering. They declared that the purpose of the law was not to "smash up the large estates" but to foster a "healthy mixture" of small, medium and large farms. Under the law reclaimed land and public land were to be provided for farming. More controversially the law also included a clause that ordered that in districts where estates of at least 100 hectares made up more than 10% of farmland, a third of their land should be made available. This was dubbed the "Baltic Third" (baltische Drittel) and originated in the promise made by the Baltic aristocracy in 1915 to give a third of their land to the government for resettlement, with modest compensation. However, the power of the Junkers meant that only approximately a quarter of this land was surrendered to the government. The law did not significantly alter the ownership structure of German agriculture. During the period 1919–1933 57,000 new farmers were settled on just over 600,000 hectares of land.
According to Alexander Gerschenkron, with the passing of the law "a momentous decision was taken. German democracy rejected the road of agrarian revolution, the road traveled by most of the countries in which the economic power of large estate owners was curbed after the World War. Germany chose the way of gradual reform. Translated into the realistic language of practical politics, this meant that the Junkers had been saved again".

Fort Lac la Pluie was a fur trade depot established by the North West Company sometime between 1775 and 1787. It was located on a high bank on the west side of modern Fort Frances, Ontario across from International Falls, Minnesota on the Rainy River downstream (west) of some rapids (Chaudière portage) where the river flows out of Rainy Lake. Upstream at the outlet of the lake was the old French post of Fort Saint Pierre (1731-1758). The site is marked by a granite boulder. Morton describes some runnable rapids, Fort Saint Pierre and a fall that had to be portaged before reaching the fort, which implies that the river level may have changed.
The place was a depot rather than a trading post and served two purposes. By this time the trade had reached the rich Lake Athabasca country which was too far to reach from Montreal in one season. Each May, when the ice broke up, boats with trade goods would head west from Montreal and winterers with canoe-loads of fur would head east. They would meet at Grand Portage on Lake Superior, exchange goods and head back before the freezup. To further save time goods and furs would be shuttled between Grand Portage and Lac la Pluie. Second, it was a source of food. The voyageurs had no time to hunt and it was difficult to haul food from Montreal. Rainy Lake produced wild rice and fish. The fort also built kegs and canoes.
With the growth of pemmican production around Lake Winnipeg its importance as a food source diminished. It declined further when the two companies merged and trade shifted from Montreal to Hudson Bay. In 1792 two men were killed while out fishing. Around 1795 John McKay (fur trader) of the Hudson's Bay Company had a rival post nearby. With the merger of the two firms in 1821 it was taken over by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1830 it was named Fort Frances in honor of Governor Simpson's new wife. Its date of closure is uncertain. For the trade route in general see Winnipeg River.

"Death of Samantha" is a song written by Yoko Ono and first released on their 1973 album Approximately Infinite Universe. It was also released as a single, backed by "Yang Yang". It has also been covered by a number of artists, including Boy George, Hermine Demoriane and Porcupine Tree.
Description
"Death of Samantha" is sung by Ono, with their husband John Lennon playing rhythm guitar and Elephant's Memory providing additional musical backing. Author Gillian Gaar has called the song a "moving portrayal" of a woman who has "repressed all feelings for the sake of outward appearance". Steven Mirkin of the Orange County Register describes the song as "slow twisty blues". Jon Pareles of The New York Times calls the song "elegiac". Ono biographer Jerry Hopkins calls it "depressing". Author Bruce Pollock claims that in the song, Ono "sounds eerily like Kate Bush".
Ono's son Sean Lennon claims that the song was inspired by an incident that occurred on election night in 1972. That night, Richard Nixon, whose administration had Lennon under surveillance and wanted Lennon deported, was re-elected as President of the United States. Lennon got drunk at a party and fondled another woman's breasts. Sean has stated that the song "was all about dad having sex with some girl at a party where my mom was". Ono has said that the song flashed to them in the studio, remembering "something terribly upsetting" that had happened to her, and was feeling like they were "really sad".
Ono has stated that when they wrote the song they "sort of saw this graveyard", explaining that it was not exactly a graveyard because there weren't many gravestones, but rather a gray day with "gray people standing around like somebody has died".
After John Lennon's death, many fans found the lyrics of "Death of Samantha" descriptive of the vigil for Lennon. Ono has said that at the time "many fans sent me the 'Death of Samantha' lyrics saying that it was uncanny that the lyrics seemed to be describing the vigil. They said, 'You were talking about now.' It was very sad but in a way it was kind of spot-on."
Reception
Ultimate Classic Rock critic Michael Gallucci rated it as Ono's 3rd best song, describing it as "a bluesy dirge that's part-feminist manifesto, part-lover's lament, and one of their best songs."
In addition to its appearance on Approximately Infinite Universe, "Death of Samantha" has appeared on a number of Ono's compilation albums, including Onobox and Walking on Thin Ice.
Other versions
Porcupine Tree covered "Death of Samantha" on the 2007 collaboration album Yes, I'm a Witch, performing with Ono's vocals. James Hunter of SPIN Magazine describes their version as "gothlike." Robert Sandall of The Daily Telegraph remarks on the contrast between Ono's "gravely tremulous vocal" and the acoustic guitar backing, which they describe as "a stark approach which lends them the air of a Leonard Cohen impersonator". Amy Longsdorf of The Spokesman-Review calls it one of the best songs on Yes, I'm a Witch, claiming it has a "silvery spaciousness" to it, describing the song as "aching".
Hermine Demoriane covered the song on their 1984 album Lonely at the Top. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett calls this version "an inspired nod to an equally unique artist".
A cover by Boy George has been released on their 2013 album This Is What I Do. A dub version, featuring Sinead O'Connor, can be found on the online-only release of "This Is What I Dub".
Other influences
The punk rock band Death of Samantha took its name from this song.
The song also features on the soundtrack to the Australian 2016 film Boys in the Trees.

Media

Anime
An anime television series adaptation by Passione was announced. The series is directed by Toru Kitahata, with Takeo Takahashi credited as chief director. A key visual was unveiled on March 21, 2017. The anime aired in Japan between April 7 and June 23, 2017 and was simulcast by Crunchyroll. The series ran for 12 episodes. The opening and ending themes respectively are and , both performed by Gekidan Hitotose (M.A.O, Miyu Tomita, Yui Ogura, Hisako Tōjō, and Marika Kōno).
ReceptionAnime News Network had five editors review the first episode of the anime: Rebecca Silverman was critical of Hinako's scarecrow act feeling false when socializing with people but was intrigued by where it will go in later episodes when the theatre stuff begins; Lynzee Loveridge noted how the production focused on its cast delivering harmless cute antics found in similar anime, crediting the decent chemistry but found it lacking in both comedy and dramatic development, saying it will fulfill its given niche and garner a small following that bought merch related to it; Nick Creamer was generally unimpressed by the adaptation's "rote basics" of the subgenre it occupies, highlighting the overused jokes and middling atmosphere that encompassed the episode, calling it "a passable effort for genre enthusiasts" but nothing more; Paul Jensen also noticed the usual slice-of-life trappings throughout the episode, pointing out the vibrant animation and "mildly amusing" cast of adorable female characters but felt it was missing a "spark of creativity" to put it above the other all-girl comedy shows that came out in previous seasons, saying its "merely competent on a basic level." The fifth reviewer, Theron Martin, saw potential in the series with its main hero Hinako overcoming their social anxiety through theatre and also gave praise to both studio Passione and director Takeo Takahashi for making a "creative departure" from their comfort zone to create an opener with solid delivery in both its aesthetic and humor, concluding that: "I probably won't watch any more, as this series isn't my kind of thing, but it looks quite promising for those who do like such fare."

Henry Cowan (5 December 1893 – 1974) was a Scottish footballer who played for Clyde and Dunfermline Athletic in their native country and for several clubs – primarily the New Bedford Whalers – in the United States, mainly as a full back. Reports from the time indicate that they were deaf and/or mute.
Career
Scotland
Raised in Eastfield, South Lanarkshire, Cowan began their known senior career with local club Clyde in 1916 (he was around 22 years old and it is likely they played for other clubs earlier, but this is unconfirmed). They were ever-present in their first season at Shawfield Stadium – 38 league appearances – and continued to feature regularly for the club throughout the duration of World War I (when many competitions were suspended but the Scottish Football League continued for public morale), suggesting that they were employed in a reserved occupation in addition to being a sportsman, although their later marriage and travel documentation listed them as a dyer outwith football so it may have been their hearing impairment which excused them from active service. A match report from October 1918 stated that Cowan "was again a dominating personality at pivot" in a victory over Hearts.
Their eight years at Clyde also included reaching three finals of the Glasgow Cup, all ending in defeat (twice losing out to Celtic and once to Rangers after a replay, in which Cowan conceded a penalty kick for handball which resulted in the only goal). Their spell at the club ended at the same time as their relegation from the top division in 1923–24, ending an 18-year run in the top division. A benefit match was played for them against Rangers in March 1924 to recognise their long service.
United States
Cowan moved on to Dunfermline Athletic for one season before heading to the United States, aged 31, to play in the American Soccer League.
Initially they were with the New Bedford Whalers, playing regularly for two seasons and winning the Lewis Cup in 1926. They then had short spells with other clubs: they began 1927–28 with the Hartford Americans before they were withdrawn from the league, then played a few matches each for the New York Nationals and the Fall River Marksmen – they were not involved in the later stages of the Nationals' winning run in the 1928 National Challenge Cup. In 1928–29 they played for J. & P. Coats who changed identity mid-season to become the Pawtucket Rangers. By now at the veteran stage, they returned to the Whalers in 1929 and played a handful of games for them, likely as an emergency stand-in, over the next two seasons, a somewhat chaotic period known as the 'soccer wars', featuring several disputes, teams resigning and rival leagues being created, coinciding with the great depression which brought about the end of the system altogether a few years later.
Personal life
Their son of the same name was born in Scotland but grew up in New Bedford and became an American citizen in order to serve in the US Air Force during World War II; they were killed in action in 1944.

Second Chance is an American body armor manufacturing company that was the first firm to use kevlar for body armor. The company was founded in the early 1970s by former U.S. Marine and pizza delivery owner/driver Richard Davis. Davis developed the idea of a bulletproof vest after shooting three armed robbers in self-defense during a delivery. This incident was later documented in a 1995 book written by firearms instructor Massad Ayoob called The Ayoob Files: The Book.
Davis started their company out of their garage. In early sales demonstrations, they would put on one of their vests and then shoot himself, usually with a firearm provided by whatever agency they were demonstrating for.
In 1998, Second Chance introduced Zylon-based body armor (bullet-resistant vests), as a lightweight alternative to kevlar. The Zylon material used in the vests was supplied by Japan-based Toyobo.
In June 2005, the National Institute of Justice, the United States government agency responsible for developing safety standards, determined that these Zylon-based vests did not meet the required standards and may be defective. The United States Department of Justice advised law enforcement agencies to replace the vests used by police officers.
On August 2, 2005, Second Chance was acquired by Armor Holdings, Inc. for US$45 million.

Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91 (1945), also known as the Screws precedent, was a 1945 Supreme Court case that made it difficult for the federal government to bring prosecutions when local government officials killed African-Americans in an extra-judicial manner.
Claude Screws, the sheriff of Baker County, Georgia, arrested Robert "Bobby" Hall, an African American, on January 29, 1943. Hall had allegedly stolen a tire, and was alleged to have tried to fight back against Screws and two of their deputies during the arrest. Hall was arrested at their home. Screws then beat Hall to death.
The local U.S. attorney then convened a grand jury which indicted Screws on charges of violating Hall's civil rights. Screws was then convicted at the federal court house in Albany, Georgia. The conviction was upheld by the Circuit Court and then appealed to the Supreme Court. While the case was moving through the courts Screws was reelected as sheriff by a very wide margin.
The Supreme Court, in a decision authored by William O. Douglas, ruled that the federal government had not shown that Screws had the intention of violating Hall's civil rights when they killed him. This ruling greatly reduced the frequency with which federal civil rights cases were brought over the next few years.

Buttonwood Park Historic District is a historic district on Kempton Street, Rockdale Avenue, Hawthorne Street and Brownell Avenue in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Its focal point is Buttonwood Park, a municipal park planned by Charles Eliot in the 1890s, and part of its surrounding neighborhood. The neighborhood was developed in the first decades of the 20th century as a complement to the park, and contains a fine selection of Colonial Revival and Craftsman style houses. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
Description and history
Buttonwood Park is a roughly L-shaped public park located west of downtown New Bedford. The northernmost section of the park is wooded, and is separated from the rest of the park by a pond. The southern edge of the pond is dammed, and a road, part of the park's circulation, passes east–west across the dam. The southwestern part of the park is occupied by Buttonwood Park Zoo, and the southeastern portion is a combination of an open lawn (for passive recreation) and formal athletic facilities. The park's state represents a partial implementation and subsequent modification to a master plan drafted by Charles Eliot in the 1890s.
The park is bounded by four major local roadways: Brownell Avenue on the west, Kempton Street to the north, Rockdale Avenue to the east, and Hawthorne Street to the south. The northeastern portion of this quadrangle is subdivided into streets of residential housing, and the opposite sides of the bounding streets are also generally lined with housing. These are typically one or two-family wood-frame buildings, built in styles popular in the early 20th century. The most commonly found styles are the Craftsman (particularly in the Bungalow variant) and the Colonial Revival, although there are some clusters of Queen Anne Victorians. Lot sizes are small, and the houses are generally set back similar distances from the street. There is one church, and a few modern commercial intrusions.

Alyosha (an affectionate diminutive of Aleksey) is an tall reinforced concrete statue of a Soviet soldier on Bunarjik Hill in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The statue tops a pedestal lined with granite. The memorial commemorates Soviet casualties incurred during the Soviet occupation of Bulgaria (which had been an Axis ally) in World War II. It was installed in 1954-57.
"Alyosha" is also the name of Konstantin Vanshenkin and Eduard Kolmanovski's song that was adopted as Plovdiv's official anthem until 1989. A well-known poem about the Plovdiv Soldier was written by Robert Rozhdestvensky.
Plovdiv authorities sought to have the statue removed on at least two occasions, in 1989 and 1996. The 1989 decision led to a preservation campaign which included a guard by the statue day and night in order to prevent it from being demolished.
Alyosha Skurlatov, a soldier of the 3rd Ukrainian Front who served as the model for this statue, died in 2013 at the age of 91.

Orthoceras strictum, commonly known as the bird's-mouth orchid or horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to eastern and southern Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. It has between two and five linear leaves and up to nine yellowish green, brownish or blackish flowers with two long, erect to spreading lateral sepals.
Description
Orthoceras strictum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a tuft of between two and five linear to thread-like, grass-like leaves, long and wide. Up to nine flowers wide are borne on a rigid flowering stem tall. Flower colour varies from blackish, brownish, maroon to yellowish green. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped and forms a hood over the rest of the flower, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear, horn-like, long, about wide and erect, spreading or curved. The petals are oblong, long, about wide and hidden inside the dorsal sepal. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The middle lobe is elliptic to egg-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are long, about wide. There is a pyramid-shaped callus near the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to February.
Taxonomy and naming
Orthoceras strictum was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in their book Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The generic name (Orthoceras) is derived from the Ancient Greek words orthos meaning "straight" and keras, keratos meaning "horn, which alludes to the upright lateral sepals. The specific epithet (strictum) is a Latin word meaning "straight" or "tight".
Distribution and habitat
The bird's-mouth orchid is widespread but uncommon and occurs in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New Caledonia. It grows in a wide range of habitats from grassy forest to heath. The differences between this species and Orthoceras novae-zeelandiae from New Zealand are "very slight and dubious".
Conservation
Orthoceras strictum is listed in Tasmania as "rare" under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

The Vilna Group was a circle of Jewish Social-Democrats which met secretly in the city of Vilna, then part of the Russian empire (now Vilnius in Lithuania). The group was founded in the mid-1890s. Its members devoted themselves to disseminating Marxist and socialist literature to Jewish textile workers and to some extent to Jewish and non-Jewish workers generally, providing literacy and education classes for workers and supporting the formation of trade unions. They were among the first to produce socialist literature in Yiddish. All this was illegal and had to be done clandestinely, and all members of the Vilna Group were arrested at various points. The Vilna group included, among others, Arkadi Kremer and their wife Pati Kremer (a.k.a. Matla Srednicki or Srednitskaya), John Mill and Mikhail Liber. It was one of the precursors of the General Jewish Workers' Association in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (known as the 'Bund'), founded in 1897. The Vilna Group also played a role in founding the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP) in 1898. Most veterans of the Vilna Group later supported the Mensheviks.

"Kurdish melodies (, ) is a collection of Kurdish folk songs collected and transcribed by Armenian composer Komitas during field work among Kurds and published in December 1903. Despite collecting a large amount of Kurdish melodies, most of them were lost and Kurdish melodies became the only publication of Kurdish songs by Komitas. Kurdish melodies would consequently become the first publication of Kurdish music.
Work
In their transcription, Komitas stayed loyal to the authentic structure of the songs and kept the unique Kurdish melodic structure. Most of the songs were epic songs. Komitas aspired to write down, preserve and make available the musical national heritage of the Kurdish people. For this, they sought to rest on authenticity. Moreover, they were keen on not collecting songs from the cities since these were corrupted and therefore spent most of their time in villages among locals. They began collecting Kurdish songs in the mid-1800s before returning to Echmiadzin in 1899.
The songs were collected around Mount Ararat.

In some programming languages, function overloading or method overloading is the ability to create multiple functions of the same name with different implementations. Calls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that function appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to perform different tasks depending on context.
For example, and are overloaded functions. To call the latter, an object must be passed as a parameter, whereas the former does not require a parameter, and is called with an empty parameter field. A common error would be to assign a default value to the object in the second function, which would result in an ambiguous call error, as the compiler wouldn't know which of the two methods to use.
Another example is a function that executes different actions based on whether it's printing text or photos. The two different functions may be overloaded as If we write the overloaded print functions for all objects our program will "print", we never have to worry about the type of the object, and the correct function call again, the call is always: .
Languages supporting overloading
Languages which support function overloading include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
Apex
C++
C#
Swift
Fortran
Kotlin
Java
PostgreSQL and PL/SQL
Scala
TypeScript
Wolfram Language
Elixir
Nim
Rules in function overloading
The same function name is used for more than one function definition
The functions must differ either by the arity or types of their parameters
It is a classification of static polymorphism in which a function call is resolved using some "best match" algorithm, where the particular function to call is resolved by finding the best match of the formal parameter types with the actual parameter types. The details of this algorithm vary from language to language.
Function overloading is usually associated with statically-typed programming languages that enforce type checking in function calls. An overloaded function is really just a set of different functions that happen to have the same name. The determination of which function to use for a particular call is resolved at compile time.
In Java, function overloading is also known as compile-time polymorphism and static polymorphism.
Function overloading should not be confused with forms of polymorphism where the choice is made at runtime, e.g. through virtual functions, instead of statically.
Example: Function overloading in C++
#include <iostream>
int Volume(int s) { // Volume of a cube.
return s * s * s;
}
double Volume(double r, int h) { // Volume of a cylinder.
return 3.1415926 * r * r * static_cast<double>(h);
}
long Volume(long l, int b, int h) { // Volume of a cuboid.
return l * b * h;
}
int main() {
std::cout << Volume(10);
std::cout << Volume(2.5, 8);
std::cout << Volume(100l, 75, 15);
}
In the above example, the volume of each component is calculated using one of the three functions named "volume", with selection based on the differing number and type of actual parameters.
Constructor overloading
Constructors, used to create instances of an object, may also be overloaded in some object-oriented programming languages. Because in many languages the constructor's name is predetermined by the name of the class, it would seem that there can be only one constructor. Whenever multiple constructors are needed, they are to be implemented as overloaded functions. In C++, default constructors take no parameters, instantiating the object members with their appropriate default values, "which is normally zero for numeral fields and empty string for string fields". For example, a default constructor for a restaurant bill object written in C++ might set the tip to 15%:
Bill()
: tip(0.15), // percentage
total(0.0)
{ }
The drawback to this is that it takes two steps to change the value of the created Bill object. The following shows creation and changing the values within the main program:
Bill cafe;
cafe.tip = 0.10;
cafe.total = 4.00;
By overloading the constructor, one could pass the tip and total as parameters at creation. This shows the overloaded constructor with two parameters. This overloaded constructor is placed in the class as well as the original constructor we used before. Which one gets used depends on the number of parameters provided when the new Bill object is created (none, or two):
Bill(double tip, double total)
: tip(tip),
total(total)
{ }
Now a function that creates a new Bill object could pass two values into the constructor and set the data members in one step. The following shows creation and setting the values:
Bill cafe(0.10, 4.00);
This can be useful in increasing program efficiency and reducing code length.
Another reason for constructor overloading can be to enforce mandatory data members. In this case the default constructor is declared private or protected (or preferably deleted since C++11) to make it inaccessible from outside. For the Bill above total might be the only constructor parameter since a Bill has no sensible default for total whereas tip defaults to 0.15.
Complications
Two issues interact with and complicate function overloading: Name masking (due to scope) and implicit type conversion.
If a function is declared in one scope, and then another function with the same name is declared in an inner scope, there are two natural possible overloading behaviors: the inner declaration masks the outer declaration (regardless of signature), or both the inner declaration and the outer declaration are both included in the overload, with the inner declaration masking the outer declaration only if the signature matches. The first is taken in C++: "in C++, there is no overloading across scopes." As a result, to obtain an overload set with functions declared in different scopes, one needs to explicitly import the functions from the outer scope into the inner scope, with the keyword.
Implicit type conversion complicates function overloading because if the types of parameters do not exactly match the signature of one of the overloaded functions, but can match after type conversion, resolution depends on which type conversion is chosen.
These can combine in confusing ways: An inexact match declared in an inner scope can mask an exact match declared in an outer scope, for instance.
For example, to have a derived class with an overloaded function taking a or an , using the function taking an from the base class, in C++, one would write:
class B {
public:
void F(int i);
};
class D : public B {
public:
using B::F;
void F(double d);
};
Failing to include the results in an parameter passed to in the derived class being converted to a double and matching the function in the derived class, rather than in the base class; Including results in an overload in the derived class and thus matching the function in the base class.
Caveats
If a method is designed with an excessive number of overloads, it may be difficult for developers to discern which overload is being called simply by reading the code. This is particularly true if some of the overloaded parameters are of types that are inherited types of other possible parameters (for example "object"). An IDE can perform the overload resolution and display (or navigate to) the correct overload.
Type-based overloading can also hamper code maintenance, where code updates can accidentally change which method overload is chosen by the compiler.

Nora Creina is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the state's south-east coast overlooking the Southern Ocean. It is about to the north-west of the city of Mount Gambier and about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide.
Nora Creina was originally the name given to a shack site. Its boundaries were established in 1997 and 1999 respectively for the portions within the Wattle Range Council and the District Council of Robe and include both the Nora Creina Shack Site and Little Dip Shack Area. The locality was given “the long established name” which is presumably derived from Nora Creina Bay which is located within the locality and which was named after the ship wreck Nora Creina SA0006883) with the following layers selected - "Suburbs and Localities" and "Place names (gazetteer)" |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012010923/http://maps.sa.gov.au/plb/ |work=Property Location Browser |publisher=Government of South Australia |accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref>
Nora Creina occupies land along the coastline between the southern shore of Lake Robe in the north and in part by Lake George Road in the south. It is bounded to the east in the north by Lake Eliza and in south by the Southern Ports Highway in the south. It includes the full extent of Lake St Clair.
Land use within the locality consists of agriculture with a strip of land along the coastline being zoned for conservation which includes the protected area known as the Little Dip Conservation Park at its northern end and land on the east side of Lake St Clair which includes the protected area known as the Lake St Clair Conservation Park. A settlement is located to the south-east of the coastline of Nora Creina Bay within the jurisdiction of the District Council of Robe.
The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Nora Creina shared a population of 36 people with the portion of the locality of Bray located within the Wattle Range Council.
Nora Creina is located within the federal Division of Barker, the state electoral district of MacKillop and the local government areas of the District Council of Robe and the Wattle Range Council.

CHFM-FM (Star 95.9) is a Canadian radio station broadcasting at 95.9 FM in Calgary, Alberta. Owned by Rogers Sports & Media, the station broadcasts an adult contemporary format. CHFM's studios are located on 7th Avenue Southwest in Downtown Calgary, while its transmitter is located on Patina Hill Drive Southwest in West Calgary.
As of Winter 2020, CHFM is the 4th-most-listened-to radio station in the Calgary market according to a PPM data report released by Numeris.
History
CHFM was Calgary's first FM radio station when it signed on the air in 1962, as a beautiful music station. Moffat Communications (owners of the legendary CKXL in Calgary) purchased the station in 1972. The station would move to an adult contemporary format during the 1980s as FM 96.
In 1992, Moffat Communications sold CHFM to Rogers Broadcasting as part of the company's sale of their Radio division. Shortly after, the station rebranded as Lite 96 CHFM, quickly becoming one of the most popular stations in Calgary.
CHFM would become Lite 95.9 in 2011 with a slight format change to Hot AC, away from their long running soft music tradition.
The station rebranded as Kiss 95.9 on December 26, 2013. In December 2017, the station returned to AC and rebranded using its call letters, with branding modelled after sister station CHFI in Toronto.
In February 2022, the station rebranded as Star 95.9 and introduced a new on-air lineup.

Stop Genocide is a 1971 documentary film by Bangladeshi filmmaker Zahir Raihan. It is a 20-minute film that documents the killings and atrocities carried out by the Pakistan Army on the people of the then East Pakistan. It also depicts the plight of the refugees and the activities of the Government in exile.
Raihan made their debut in making of documentary films with Stop Genocide.
Raihan started planning for this documentary around April–May in 1971 and soon started making it. Film director Alamgir Kabir helped him. Filmed in June, it was produced in less than a month.
The similarity of this documentary with some of those by Cuban filmmaker Santiago Álvarez indicates Álvarez's influence over Zahir Raihan. Raihan adopted a new technique of film-making of using found video clips and photographs while they were working for this documentary. The film was created using whatever was found in newsreel clips and footage. Raihan made this documentary with an aim to move world opinion against the brutal acts committed by the Pakistan Army.
Raihan was a Refugee staying in Kolkata when they made this film.
Content summary
The documentary starts by quoting Lenin from The Right of Nations to Self-Determination. A sketch of Lenin appears at the beginning and then a series of long and mid shots delineate a peaceful country life. But soon gunshots and turbulence replaces the tranquility. The next few shots portray the plunder, fire, wreckage, and killings committed by the Pakistan Army. The preamble of the United Nations Charter is mentioned several times. A series of still photos create some of the sequences that show the bombing of the US Air force in Vietnam and its aftermath. The Dateline shows Saigon of 20 July. Bomber B-52 and a burnt Vietnamese child are seen. The focus switches from Saigon to Bongaon, India. Processions of refugees make a few sequences. A picture of struggling, distressing life of homeless, helpless, frightened refugees follows. Some of the refugees are seen looking for shelter in refugee camps while not an inch of any camp can accommodate them. Next appears a series of long shots taken from pictures of raped women, destroyed buildings and heaps of dead bodies. Alternating appearances of Hitler, pictures of Nazis, the massacre by Nazis, piles of dead bodies nearby German prison camps, refugee camps in India, heaps of dead bodies in the streets of Bangladesh, fire, and wreckage in towns and villages make the next few scenes. Numerous corpses are seen in rivers, streets, paddy fields, under the trees and on green, long grass. Shot after shot illustrate the sufferings of refugees. An old woman talks to an inquirer. The camera focuses on a group of armed guerrilla returning from an operation. Soon they disappear in the woods. Camps of freedom fighters and the camp commandant appear. The commandant gives an interview. They talk about the war, the reason behind the war, the moral strength and confidence they own. The documentary ends with the word STOP occupying full frame.
Production
The black-and-white documentary used 35 mm film.
The narrative was in English and it was an opportunity to convey the message of the suffering of oppressed people of the newly born country of Bangladesh to the rest of the world.
The documentary was produced by Bangladesh Chalachitra Shilpi-O-Kushali Swahayak Samity.

Financing
The Department of Films and Publications of Mujibnagar Government did not consider the director's attempt to make a documentary on the ongoing Liberation War important at first. Later they agreed to finance the documentary.
With the help of a few cultural activists, Raihan managed to collect funds for the film from a national organization comprising Indian film directors.
Film release and distributions
The film was released in 1971.
The Mujibnagar Cabinet, along with some other exiled politicians, witnessed the first screening of Stop Genocide at a secret place in India. The acting Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad appreciated the documentary. Moreover, moved by the film, the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi directed their film division to buy the film and distribute it internationally.
Awards
Stop Genocide won an award in Tashkent film festival in 1972. It also won the SIDLOC award at the Delhi Film Festival in 1975.

Montabaur is an electoral constituency (German: Wahlkreis) represented in the Bundestag. It elects one member via first-past-the-post voting. Under the current constituency numbering system, it is designated as constituency 204. It is located in northern Rhineland-Palatinate, comprising the district of Westerwaldkreis and the eastern part of the Rhein-Lahn-Kreis district.
Montabaur was created for the inaugural 1949 federal election. Since 2021, it has been represented by Tanja Machalet of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Geography
Montabaur is located in northern Rhineland-Palatinate. As of the 2021 federal election, it comprises the district of Westerwaldkreis and, from the district of Rhein-Lahn-Kreis, the Verbandsgemeinden of Aar-Einrich, Diez, and Nastätten, and the municipalities of Attenhausen, Dessighofen, Dienethal, Dornholzhausen, Geisig, Hömberg, Lollschied, Misselberg, Nassau, Obernhof, Oberwies, Pohl, Schweighausen, Seelbach, Singhofen, Sulzbach, Weinähr, Winden, and Zimmerschied from the Bad Ems-Nassau Verbandsgemeinde.
History
Montabaur was created in 1949, then known as Westerburg. It acquired its current name in the 1965 election. In the 1949 election, it was Rhineland-Palatinate constituency 8 in the numbering system. In the 1953 through 1976 elections, it was number 155. In the 1980 through 1998 elections, it was number 153. In the 2002 election, it was number 207. In the 2005 election, it was number 206. In the 2009 and 2013 elections, it was number 205. Since the 2017 election, it has been number 204.
Originally, the constituency comprised the districts of Oberwesterwaldkreis, Unterwesterwaldkreis, Unterlahnkreis, and St. Goarshausen. While its borders did not change until the 2002 election, a number of administrative changes took place in the following decades: in 1961, the St. Goarshausen district was renamed Loreleykreis; in 1969, the Unterlahnkreis and Loreleykreis districts were merged into the new Rhein-Lahn-Kreis district; and in 1974, the Oberwesterwaldkreis and Unterwesterwaldkreis districts were merged into the new Westerwaldkreis district. The constituency acquired its current borders in the 2002 election.
Members
The constituency has been held by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) during all but two Bundestag terms since its creation. It was first represented by Robert Stauch of the CDU from 1949 to 1965, followed by August Hanz until 1972. Willi Peiter of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) was elected in 1972 and served a single term. Former member Hanz regained it in 1976 and served until 1987. Joachim Hörster was then representative from 1987 to 1998. Rudolf Scharping of the SPD was elected in 1998 and served a single term. Former member Hörster regained it in 2002 and served until 2013. Andreas Nick was elected 2013 and re-elected in 2017. Tanja Machalet won the constituency for the SPD in 2021.

Pellegrino Luigi Odoardo Rossi (13 July 1787 – 15 November 1848) was an Italian economist, politician and jurist. They were an important figure of the July Monarchy in France, and the minister of justice in the government of the Papal States, under Pope Pius IX.
Biography
Rossi was born in Carrara, then under the Duchy of Massa and Carrara. Educated at the University of Pisa and the University of Bologna, they became professor of law at the latter in 1812. In 1815 they gave their support to Joachim Murat and their Neapolitan anti-Austrian expedition: after the latter's fall, they escaped to France, and then proceeded to Geneva, where they began teaching a course of jurisprudence applied to Roman law, the success of which gained them the unusual honour of naturalization as a citizen of Geneva. In 1820 they were elected as a deputy to the cantonal council, and was a member of the diet of 1832; Rossi was entrusted with the task of drawing up a revised constitution, which was known as the Pacte Rossi. This was rejected by a majority of the diet, a result which deeply affected Rossi, and made them accept the invitation of François Guizot to settle in France.
Here they were appointed in 1833 to the chair of political economy in the Collège de France, vacated by the death of Jean-Baptiste Say. They were naturalized as a French citizen in 1834, and in the same year became professor of constitutional law in the faculty of law of the Paris University. In 1836 they were elected a member of the Academy of Political and Moral Sciences, was raised to the French peerage in 1839, and in 1843 became dean of the faculty of law.
In 1842 Rossi and Count Ferdinand-Charles-Philippe d' Esterno (1805–83) organized the first meetings of what would become the Société d'économie politique.
In 1845, Guizot appointed Rossi ambassador of France to the Papal States, with a specific mission to discuss the question of the Jesuits. However, the French Revolution of 1848 toppled Guizot's regime, and the revolution in Italy fully severed Rossi's connection with France. Rossi thus remained at Rome and became Minister of the Interior under Pius IX. Rossi's program of liberal reforms, however, never took off, as their brand of moderate liberalism, in which suffrage was to be limited to the well-off and the economic and social disruptions created by industrialization went unaddressed, had narrow appeal.
Their assassination took place on the stairs at the opening of the Parliament in the Palazzo della Cancelleria on 15 November 1848 by a stab wound to the neck. This was one of the causes of the flight from Rome of Pope Pius IX and the beginning of the series of events that led to the proclamation of the Roman Republic.
The murderer was said to be Luigi Brunetti, the elder son of Angelo Brunetti (or Ciceruacchio), who acted at the instigation of Pietro Sterbini, and with the cooperation of some veterans or reduci of the conflict in Lombardy. After the murder, the senate adjourned without much sorrow, and little to no attention to the murder victim. That night crowds at the house of Rossi's widow chanted Blessed is the hand that stabbed the Rossi. Sterbini went on to play a prominent role in the Roman Republic in 1849, but fled into exile after its fall, until 1861. In a trial held in 1854, a man by the name of Gabriele Constantini was convicted and executed.
The city of Carrara erected a statue in honour of Pellegrino Rossi.

Travancore State Manual was a publication of the erstwhile Travancore kingdom, written and published under the statutory command of the king of Travancore. The Travancore kingdom was located at the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, on its western side.
Travancore State Manual was written by V. Nagam Aiya, who was then working as the Dewan Peishcar in Travancore government service.
The section on the Fauna of Travancore was contributed by Harold S. Ferguson, Esq. (F. L. N., F. Z. S), who Nagam Aiya describes in the following words: "a subject upon which they are an authority having spent nearly the whole of their life in the country, first as a Planter for several years on the Travancore Hills, then as the Guardian of the Princes, then as Commandant of one of the battalions in the Travancore army (Nayar Brigade), and lastly as the Director of the Government Museum and the Public Gardens at Trivandrum."
The writing
V Nagam Aiya mentions that they were commanded by Their Highness, the Maharajah of Travancore to write the Travancore State Manual with the simple instruction that it should follow the model of the district manuals of the Madras Presidency, which was under English rule. However, they also mention that the idea had been ‘broached' to them by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier. At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistrate of Quilon. Even though, the Dewan did obtain the Maharajah sanction for the project, the Dewan themselves retired within a few months, and the matter was dropped.
However, the matter was revived by Dewan Mr. K. Krishnaswamy Row, C.I.E., in 1901. Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this book. What came out was a book of ‘encyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter-press'.
It might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in their mind, and they must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before they started on this work. They started their work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904.
Contents
The Travancore State Manual is a huge book not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place. It is not a just a book on the history of the place. A detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the place is also there.
Detailed writings are there on the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes, rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees, and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, ‘Archaeology', ‘Fauna', census and population, language, economic condition and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound.
There are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom.
The latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom. The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend. This legend is also mentioned in great detail. Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals.
Mentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out.
Then the history part deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy.
There is either detailed mention or detailed write-up on such items as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of Travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings and kingdoms north of Travancore, small-time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc.
Velu Thampi Dalawa's rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find their cause correct or praiseworthy. The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations.
QUOTE: Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was their forte. END of QUOTE.
QUOTE: Their favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. END of QUOTE.
All rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal's (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.
Problems with the contents
From the perspective of modern Indian history and sociology writings, this book has many issues which can make it a disturbance. The main problem is that it is written in a sort of impartial and non-jingoistic manner.
The writing of this book has been done from a most impartial manner with regard to caste and social issues. Even though Nagam Aiya is a Brahmin, there has been no attempt to portray any group or castes as above blame. In fact, the detailing is so honest, that not many modern Travancorians would actually like to recommend this book to anyone for a detailed reading.
The various false aspirations and claims of the various castes and the tragic sides of their lives have been portrayed with rare honesty.
The general culture of official corruption rampant in Travancore bureaucracy, which was more or less hereditary caste-based in mentioned in raw words.
The lower castes are also not mentioned in a praiseworthy manner.
The next item of jingoistic reproach would be the very obvious support to the English colonial rule. This feature can be felt in many pages dealing with the colonial times in the subcontinent. In the very introduction of the book, Nagam Aiya mentions thus:
QUOTE: ultimate success of the English East India Company, our early friendships with them and the staunch support which they in return uniformly gave us through all vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately resulting in a strong bond of political alliance and reciprocal trust and confidence, which assured to us internal security and immunity from external aggression, thus enabling us to achieve the triumphs of peace and good government, until step by step we reached the enviable height of being known as the Model Native State' of India END OF QUOTE
King Marthanda Varma's words on their deathbed: QUOTE: That, above all, the friendship existing between the English East India Company and Travancore should be maintained at any risk, and that full confidence should always be placed in the support and aid of that honourable association." END OF QUOTE is also mentioned in the book.
This kind of writings found in various parts of the book as well as other items of a similar kind does lend support to the feeling that Nagam Aiya was supportive of the English rulers in the neighbouring Madras Presidency.
Another item that can disturb modern folks in south Kerala would be the details given about the social revolts by the lower castes, such as the Ezhava, Shanars, Pulaya, Pariah etc. for social and political freedom. Enough and more historical incidences are mentioned that point to the fact that this social upheaval was the handiwork of the English Missionaries from the London Missionary Society. Beyond that it is seen mentioned that each time such social problems happened, the English officials from Madras exerted pressure on the raja family to give the freedom that was demanded by the lower castes.
However, Nagam Aiya does hint that the English rulers did not understand the social issues correctly. That even when the lower castes were given some freedom that had not been traditionally given to them, they used the occasion to go beyond what was allowed, and create social problems and rioting.
The history of such incidences could more or less deprive the claims of some lower castes leaders that they were the persons who had spearheaded the social revolution in Travancore.
Another item that can be actively disliked is the statement that Malayalam, the erstwhile language of Travancore kingdom, and currently the state language of Kerala, is of very recent origin.
QUOTE: Another fact disclosed by the statements already given is that the language of most of the inscriptions is Tamil. The reason here is equally simple. Malayalam as a national language is not very old. Its resemblance to old Tamil is so patent that one could hardly help to conclude that Malayalam is nothing more than old Tamil with a good admixture of Sanskrit words. END of QUOTE.
In fact, there is a strong hint that the actual antiquity of Travancore is Tamil. Almost all the stone inscriptions mentioned in the book are in Tamil, with a few in Sanskrit.
Sultan Tippu (Tipu Sulthaan), who is revered by some as a great freedom fighter, is not mentioned in the superlative.

Tyris Flare (ティリス=フレア Tirisu Furea), written as Tyris=Flare in their early appearances, is one of the main protagonists of Sega's video game franchise Golden Axe and the sole playable character in Golden Axe: Beast Rider. Tyris was introduced as a princess-turned-amazon in the original beat 'em up game Golden Axe in 1989, and was controversially rebooted as a religious warrior in the 2008 action-adventure reboot Beast Rider. In both of their incarnations, they are fighting against evil forces in a heroic fantasy setting and in particular seeking have their revenge on the power-hungry warlord Death Adder. Tyris has been one of the most popular early heroes of the beat 'em up and hack and slash genres.  They are known as one of the iconic female characters of the 16-bit era.
Appearances
In the Golden Axe games
In the early Golden Axe beat 'em up games, Tyris Flare is a former princess of the Firewood Kingdom, where they lived happily with their parents, the king and the queen. One fateful day, on their 17th birthday (fourth in the PC Engine version), an evil army led by the giant Death Adder invaded their kingdom. Them father and the kingdom's army tried to fight them off, only to be defeated. After their father was slain by Death Adder, their mother escaped with them to the canyons. After momentarily evading Death Adder's army, their mother told them to remain hidden deep within the canyons no matter what happens just moments before one of Death Adder's minion suddenly appeared and killed them Tyris was then adopted by the amazons who trained them in the arts of swordsmanship and fire magic.
In the computer versions of the first game, their story was altered. There, Tyris is said to be an amazon warrior queen and the last surviving member of their jungle tribe. They have nothing more to live for - their people were all put to the sword by Death Adder's evil minions and the jungle was razed to the ground. They have sworn by all that is sacred to their people that they will avenge their deaths by defeating Death Adder and liberating the land of Yuria.
The first Golden Axe (1989) begins with the 23-year-old Tyris and their friends Ax Battler and Gilius Thunderhead find their mortally wound friend Alex, who tells them that the king and the princess have been taken by Death Adder and asks to avenge them before passing away. Tyris fights their way through the land of Yuria to the castle of Death Adder. Even though they are wielding the legendary Golden Axe, Tyris is victorious and saves the king and their daughter. A few years after Death Adder's defeat, Dark Guld claims the power of the Golden Axe conquer the land in Golden Axe II (1991) and the three warriors go into battle again to deal with this new menace. They make a cameo appearance in the action-adventure game Golden Axe Warrior. One of playable characters in the fighting game spin-off Golden Axe: The Duel is also Tyris' relative named Milan Flare.
A different Tyris Flare is the protagonist of the 2008 reboot game Golden Axe: Beast Rider, in which they are a "half-gladiator/half-barbarian" defender of the Axirian Priestesses, a female sect worshipping the Great Dragon in the Island of Axir. After the sisterhood is wiped out by Death Adder's forces, they take up sword and sorcery to avenge them and stop them from taking over the world. The game ends with their killing Death Adder in a snake form.
Gameplay and design
In Golden Axe and Golden Axe II, the Tyris has the shortest melee attack range among the heroes, but is most agile and has the most powerful spells; their magic attacks are all fire-based, including the summoning of a giant, flame-spewing dragon. In Golden Axe II, they have a new outfit.  They are blonde in the first game but their hair color changes through the series.
According to Beast Rider developer Secret Level, the focus was on reimagining them in the reboot. In their game, they have darker skin, shorter red hair, and white warpaint around their green eyes, uses various swords, and wears several different, mostly tribal-like outfits (and their original costume) that can be unlocked by the player. The game's producer Nigel Cook said: "We gathered many opinions from internal Sega employees and from actual Golden Axe fans. To be honest it was pretty much a split decision between Tyris Flare and Gilius Thunderhead. What pushed us over the edge in choosing Tyris was their unique combat style—a mixture of half gladiator, half barbarian along with their motivation for revenge against Death Adder.  They are also very pleasing on the eye!"
Other appearances
In the early-1990s Golden Axe II sequel comic serialized in Sonic the Comic, the blonde Tyris is the leader of the trio (depicted on the issue #5 cover). In the story "Citadel of Dead Souls", they get captured by the dark sorcerer Blackspell and their female apprentice Ul-Tima to be sacrificed for the resurrection of Dark Guld, but escapes and leads their friends to destroy the villains and secure the Golden Axe. While taking it back to Yuria in "Plague of Serpents", they are attacked by Cobraxis and their wizard priests, but manage to defeat them too. In 2015, Tyris was featured in the crossover comic series Worlds Unite. After their world is invaded, they destroy the witch Berkana (from Mega Man) with their fire magic; afterwards, they join heroes from other worlds to stop the villain Sigma (too from Mega Man).
A figurine of Tyris was released by Yujin as part of the SR Sega Girls Collection 2 and a T-shirt print of them was also produced. Easy Mode in the 1996 beat' em up game Dynamite Deka changes the player character Cindy Holiday into Tyris and allows them to fight Death Adder replacing one of the game's bosses. They also make a cameo appearance in the arcade version of the 1990 beat'em up Alien Storm.
Reception
Early games
Despite being introduced after some other 'bikini-clad warrior' type player characters like Princess Mariana from Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax (portrayed in advertisements by Maria Whittaker; ST Format later compared Tyris Flare to Whittaker), it was Tyris Flare who has been the first to achieve high popularity. Many video game publications noted Tyris for their sex appeal, in particular for their large bust. Brazilian magazine Ação Games placed their 14th on their list of "Top Girls" in 1997. Reviewing the first Golden Axe in 2010, GamesRadar's Justin Towell wrote "Tyris Flare is still hot, in a 1980s Barabarian chick kind of way." According to Retro Gamer, "This sexy Amazonian fighter is a firm favourite with players due to their excellent fire magic and extremely flimsy clothing." Retro Gamer included Tyris among the nine memorable "leading ladies" of video games and also commented of "thinking back to when we first saw that enormous dragon head hove into view and roast the occupants of the arcade cabinet to charcoal while Tyris strutted their stuff in a medieval bikini. That was something you didn't see every day back then." According to ABC's Good Game retrospective about early female video game characters, while in early games Tyris "forgot to put their armour on over their underwear. These days, she's much more properly attired for combat." GamesRadar's Jim Sterling included "this flame-haired temptress [who] seems to think that doing battle in a bikini is a wise idea" on their 2011 list of the sexiest sprites of all time, adding: "She has 16 bits of world class tits and nobody's taking that away from her."
Beast Rider
The character's reimagined version in Golden Axe: Beast Rider received a very mixed critical reception. GamesRadar criticized the game for removing the other heroes "leaving only a super-slutted-up version of Tyris Flare," but added: Again, we're sort of fine with that it's a chance to re-invent the series for a new age, maybe even position it as competition against God of War or Heavenly Sword. Instead, all the attention went to Tyris and their barely covered man magnets." IGN's Juan Castro questioned how "the hot" Tyris is wearing "a bikini-type outfit" for "riding bore creatures while fighting to the death. But hey, they certainly looked good." GameSpot's Chris Watters opined Tyris in the game "wears an outfit is every bit as fantastical and clichéd as the adventure they embark on." WP.pl review of Beast Rider noted a possibility of donning a "skimpy bikini that would be envied by many in adult film actor." GameTrailers review twice stressed the "sassy" Tyris is "likeable" even as their battle cries can get "especially annoying." According to GamesRadar US, however, "Tyris themselves is phenomenally unappealing," as "despite their nicely rendered model, they animate like a dysfunctional paper puppet, promptly subtracting any sex appeal they might have had from the equation." Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead lambasted Tyris' animation in the game as "hilariously bad, their movements stiff and laughably doll," comparing their run to the scene in The Muppet Movie "when they'd cut away to Kermit's legs being moved around on sticks to show them moving." Play'''s Dave Halverson wrote: "Tyris is a beautiful hero; so beautiful, in fact, that the absence of dynamic animation is all the more puzzling," singling out their "limited boob animation" as their special concern. Conversely, Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman compared Tyris to a drug addict prostitute and not because of costume as "after all and it's not an unexpected wardrobe choice for women in these sorts of games. It's just that their face and hair look really awful."
Legacy
Kristan Reed of Eurogamer included the "three big, bold, diverse characters," including Tyris, among the reason for why Golden Axe had a "huge" impact on gaming in 1989. A "squat, cartoon version of Tyris Flare" is featured as Golden Axe homage in Mooff Games' Maximus. According to USgamer's Jeremy Parish article about the controversy surrounding Dragon's Crown in the West, the game's "Amazon's red-trimmed chain mail serves as a dual homage to Red Sonja and Tyris Flare." GamesRadar's David Houghton opined Tyris should have made a guest appearance in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim despite the region's cold climate as it is "no stranger to heroes in ridiculously inappropriate clothing." The freeware fanmade prequel game Golden Axe Myth features Tyris as a playable character, and an unofficial mod adds them as a recruitable player character in the role-playing video game Baldur's Gate II. In 2014, Retro Gamer were close to choosing them as one of the classic "ingredients needed to make the ultimate scrolling fighter" for the category "Player 2 character", ultimately choosing Blaze Fielding from Sega's own Streets of Rage''.

Myton Warriors are an amateur rugby league club based in the Myton area of Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. They compete in the BARLA National Conference League Premier Division, the top tier of amateur rugby league in England, and the fourth overall tier of rugby league in England. The Warriors have local rivalries with Skirlaugh, West Hull, East Hull, and Hull Dockers.
History and formation
The Myton Warriors were formed in 1997 after previously being called Bay Horse A.R.L.F.C., playing in Division 1 of the Hull & District League. They made the second round of the 1998 Challenge Cup, after defeating London Skolars 12–10.
The Myton committee were approached by the Northern Dairies youth section (a rugby union club in the Hull area) in 1999, who proposed a merger between the open-age and youth teams from both clubs. This merger happened a year later.
Both club's committees merged and formed the club's current committee, after three years of playing from a local high school. Marist Rugby Union club approached the club in 1999 and offered to share their facilities with Myton. The Warriors have played at the Marist Rugby Union club grounds from that time. The facilities have now been developed to house rugby league, rugby union and football games on Saturdays and Sundays in winter, and cricket in the summer. It is now administrated by a committee in the name of the Marist Sporting Club in all sections.
Myton competed in the Yorkshire League for seven years and gained promotion in 2005/06 after they were Senior Division One champions. The following season Myton finished second in the league and runners-up in the play-offs. They also won the Yorkshire Cup in the 2006/07 season, only the second cup of their history. In the 2017 Challenge Cup, Myton made the third round for the first time, losing to Doncaster.

A dead key is a special kind of modifier key on a mechanical typewriter, or computer keyboard, that is typically used to attach a specific diacritic to a base letter. The dead key does not generate a (complete) character by itself, but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after. Thus, a dedicated key is not needed for each possible combination of a diacritic and a letter, but rather only one dead key for each diacritic is needed, in addition to the normal base letter keys.
For example, if a keyboard has a dead key for the grave accent (`), the French character à can be generated by first pressing and then , whereas è can be generated by first pressing and then .
Usually, the diacritic itself can be generated as an isolated character by pressing the dead key followed by space; so a plain grave accent can be typed by pressing and then .
Mechanical typewriters
The dead key is mechanical in origin, and "dead" means without movement. On mechanical typebar typewriters, all characters are of equal width. As a key is pressed, a metal typebar strikes the character onto an inked ribbon, transferring ink to the paper, and a mechanism is triggered which causes the paper (inserted in a carriage) to move forward one space. To use a single diacritic, such as the acute accent, with multiple foundation characters (such as á, é, í, ó, ú) the decision was made to create a new character, the acute accent or diacritic , which did not exist in typesetting as of that date. Due to a change in the mechanism, striking the key containing the accent did not advance the paper (the key was "dead" or non-spacing), meaning it could be followed by any character that was to appear under the acute accent, producing an overstruck character. This second key moved the paper carriage forward.
Note that with mechanical keyboards, the acute accent could be followed by any character, to create new combinations such as q with acute accent.
Electronic keyboards
A dead key is different from a typical modifier key (such as or ), in that rather than being pressed and held while another key is struck, the dead key is pressed and released before striking the key to be modified. In some computer systems, there is no indication to the user that a dead key has been struck, so the key appears dead (nothing immediately happens), but in some text-entry systems, the diacritic is displayed, along with an indication that the system is waiting for another keystroke to complete the typing sequence.
Computers, however, work differently. The dead key temporarily changes the mapping of the keyboard for the next keystroke, which activates a special keyboard mode rather than actually generating a modifier character. Instead of the normal letter, a precomposed variant, with the appropriate diacritic, is generated. Each combination of a diacritic and a base letter must be specified in the character set and must be supported by the font in use.
There is no precomposed character to combine the acute accent with the letter q, striking and then is likely to result in ´q, with the accent and letter as separate characters. However, in some systems, the invalid typing sequence may be discarded. (By using the combining characters available in the Unicode character set, it may be possible to generate a combination that more or less looks like a q with an acute accent (q́), but that technique is quite distinct from the dead key functionality. In addition, since a letter like q does not normally take accents, font makers may not include the font attributes necessary for a combining accent to be applied successfully or in an attractive way. It is necessary to test this usage on a font by font basis, since support for accenting in this way varies considerably.)
Chained dead keys
Unicode encoded over one hundred precomposed characters with two diacritics, for use in Latin script for Vietnamese and a number of other languages. For convenience, they are generated on most keyboards supporting them, by pressing the two corresponding deadkeys in any order, followed by the letter key. Therefore, these dead keys are chained, which means that the second keystroke does not trigger any insertion, the system being still awaiting another key press.
This chained dead key behavior is toggled by the dead key flag, which is the fourth argument of the DEADTRANS function (after the base character code, the diacritic code, and the composed character code). If this flag is set to its default value zero, the composed character is inserted; if it is set to one, the composed character code is handled as another diacritic code like those due to dead key presses, and occurs typically as a second argument in other dead list entries.
Chaining dead keys allows for compose key emulation by simply using the dead key feature. This may be performed either with proprietary keyboard editing software, or with driver development kits.
Dead keys on various keyboard layouts
A key may function as a dead key by default, and many non-English keyboard layouts in particular have dead keys directly on the keyboard. The basic US keyboard does not have any dead keys, but the US-International keyboard layout, available on Windows and the X Window System, places some dead keys directly on similar-looking punctuation marks. Keyboards sold in most of the rest of the world have an AltGr (Alternative graphic) key, which gives the ability to modify some letters directly and turns others into dead keys (depending on keyboard setting). Old computer systems, such as the MSX, often had a special key labeled dead key, which in combination with the Ctrl and Shift keys could be used to add some of the diacritics commonly needed in the Western European languages (´, `, ˆ and ¨) to vowels that were typed subsequently.
In the absence of a default dead key, even a normal printing key can temporarily be altered to function as a dead key by simultaneously holding down another modifier key (typically AltGr or Option). In Microsoft Word (and in most other text-input fields), using the Control key with a key that usually resembles the diacritic (e.g. ^ for a circumflex) acts as a dead key: On the Macintosh, many keyboard layouts employ dead keys. For example, when are first pressed simultaneously and then followed by , the result is á. On a Macintosh, pressing one of these Option-key combinations creates the accent and highlights it, then the final character appears when the key for the base character is pressed.
However, some accented Latin letters less common in the major Western European languages, such as ŵ (used in Welsh) or š (used in many Eastern European languages), cannot be typed with the "US" layout. For users with US keyboards, access to many more diacritics is provided by the "US International" keyboard layout. Users with UK keyboards have a similar option with UK extended layout; many other national settings are available.
In AmigaOS, dead keys are generated by pressing in combination with (acute), (grave), (circumflex), (tilde) or (trema) (e.g., the ALT-F combination followed by the key generates á and ALT-F followed by e generates é, whereas ALT-G followed by a generates à and ALT-G followed by e generates è).

The Honorary Medal for Charitable Assistance () was created at 18 June 1822 and is after the Military William Order the oldest decoration for bravery in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Furthermore, the Honorary Medal is the highest civilian decoration still being awarded for bravery, and is specifically for those who carried out a voluntary act of bravery or self-sacrifice, with an emphasis on charity.
The medal can be awarded in gold, silver or bronze. Awarding is on basis by nomination of the Netherlands government and by royal decree. The golden medal has precedence only after the Dutch Cross of Resistance (also a civilian bravery decoration, but not awarded anymore), and the silver and bronze medals have precedence after the Airman's Cross (a military bravery award).
History of the medal
Lieutenant Alexander de Langle was the first person to be rewarded with this medal in 1821 for rescuing a sergeant who was stuck at the bottom of a well. Although this was considered an act of bravery, King William I did not deem it important enough to award the lieutenant the distinguished Military William Order, so instead a new award for bravery was created: the Honorary Medal for Charitable Assistance.
The first medal was roundish and showed the portrait of King William I. At the reverse side a laurel wreath was portrayed and some space was reserved for an inscription. The medal was not meant to be worn. The size of the medal was related to the value of the metal used: a diameter of 50, 41 or 35 millimeters for subsequently a bronze, silver or golden medal.
In 1825 King William I decided that noble and charitable acts of Dutchmen were to be awarded by charitable organisations and the acts of foreigners and soldiers by the king himself.
In 1837 King William II decided by royal decree that the size of the golden, silver and bronze medals would be all 50 millimeter. Also their portrait was put on the medals.
Since 1849 the portrait of King William III was shown on the medals and from 1875 a portrait of the older and bald King William III.
When Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont became the queen regent of the Netherlands they decided to put on the medal the portrait of their minor daughter Queen Wilhelmina. In 1897 a new type of medal was created, the medal did get a ribbon to wear and also did get the same shape as the French "Medal of Saint Helena".
Since 1912 the medal has its current shape. The medal is ovally shaped with at the top a stylised royal crown. On the medal a mother with three children is portrayed. The motif is taken from the city hall in Bolsward. At the reverse side the words "De koningin aan" () and also some space is reserved for an inscription. The medal is worn with an orange ribbon that has a red band in the middle. The medallion is today still award as gold, silver or bronze.
By decree on 15 April 1952 it was decided that the golden honorary medal has precedence just below the Dutch Cross of Resistance; herewith the golden Honorary Medal for Charitable Assistance is one of the highest awards in the Netherlands. The silver and bronze honorary medals has lower precedence after the Airman's Cross.
Before or since World War II it was common to award the medal to sailors. During World War II the medal was primarily award by the Dutch government in exile to those British sailors who rescued Dutch victims from drowning by a shipwreck.
After the war the medal was significantly less awarded. In 1982 a soldier of the Royal Netherlands Air Force received the bronze medal, and in 2005 two silver medals were awarded to rescuers of the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution.
The medal was last awarded to five members of the Search and Rescue squadron 7 of the Royal Netherlands Navy, this because they saved the life of the captain and coxswain of an Iranian container ship. Silver medals were awarded on 29 May 2008 by the then Dutch Minister of Defence Eimert van Middelkoop.

Rudolf Kötzschke (8 July 1867 – 3 August 1949) was a German historian who founded the Seminar for Regional History and Settlement Studies in Leipzig, the first regional history institution at a German university.
Life and career
Born in Dresden, Kötzschke was the son of the "royal Saxon chamber musician" Hermann Kötzschke and older brother of the historian Paul Richard Kötzschke (1869–1945). They attended Gelinek's public school and from 1877 to 1885 the Kreuzschule in Dresden. From 1886 to 1889, they studied at the University of Leipzig, majoring in Latin and history and minoring in German, geography, Sanskrit and Ancient Greek; in the summer of 1887, they studied for a semester at the University of Tübingen. In Leipzig, they became a member of the (now in the Deutsche Sängerschaft). In 1889, they were awarded a doctorate in Leipzig with a thesis on Ruprecht von der Pfalz und das Konzil zu Pisa, the following year they passed the Staatsexamen. Subsequently, Kötzschke initially worked as a teacher at a Dresden and a Leipzig grammar school until the historian Karl Lamprecht brought them to Leipzig in 1894. In 1896, Kötzschke became an assistant at the Königlich Sächsischen Kommission für Geschichte.
In 1899, Kötzschke habilitated in Leipzig for "middle and modern history, in particular for Saxon regional history", the subject of the habilitation was Studien zu Verwaltungsgeschichte der Grundherrschaft Werden. Besides Lamprecht, Erich Marcks and were reviewers. After their Habilitation, Kötzschke first became a private lecturer in Leipzig and in 1906 Extraordinarius. In 1906, they were also appointed director of the Institute for Regional History and Settlement Studies, a position they held until 1936. From 1930, they held a chair of Saxon history. During the Nazi era, they became a member of the National Socialist People's Welfare, the Reichsluftschutzbund and the Reichskolonialbund. However, they did not join the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They described the Machtergreifung by the Nazis as a landmark in German history. In November 1933 they signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State.
They became an emeritus professor in 1935. In the same year, they became a member of the Sächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften. Their successor in Leipzig was the Austrian Adolf Helbok in 1935. As an academic teacher, Kötzschke supervised over 100 doctoral theses from 1906 until their retirement. Important academic students were , , and Walter Schlesinger. In 1942, Kötzschke was admitted as a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. After World War II, Kötzschke was again entrusted with the direction of the Institute for German Regional and Folk History from 1946 to 1949, which was reopened on 7 October 1946. Kötzschke continued to teach at the University of Leipzig until shortly before their death on 3 August 1949 and endeavoured to rebuild the destroyed seminar library.
Kötzschke became the founder of regional historical research as a scientific discipline.  They are considered an expert on medieval economic history, especially agricultural and settlement history. Their publications such as the Economic History of the Middle Ages, the Saxon History up to the Reformation Period and the Rural Settlement and Agrarianism in Saxony are the culmination of their research. The Rudolf Kötzschke Society was founded in 1994. Kötzschke's work during the Nazi period was first discussed in detail in a volume published in 1999.
Kötzschke died in Leipzig at the age of 82.

Yeon or less commonly Youn (연) is a Korean surname. The name may correspond to the Chinese surnames Yan (燕, 延) or Lian (連). The hanja 延 is much more common than 燕 and 連. Yeon may also refer to the extinct surname (淵).
Origin
燕
燕 (제비 연 jebi yeon) was the surname of the Yeon clan, one of the Great Eight Families of Baekje. This surname is extremely rare in the present-day with a few clans such as the Jeonju Yeon clan and the Jeongpyeong Yeon clan. The character literally means barn swallow. According to the 2015 census, 20 people had this surname.
延
延 (늘일 연 ) is the most common hanja character used for the surname "Yeon". The most common bon-gwan is the Goksan Yeon clan (곡산 연씨), whose ancestor Yeon Gye-ryeong originated from Hongnong Commandery and later went to Goryeo. During the Joseon dynasty, the Japanese surname Nobu (延) was naturalized into Korean as Yeon. According to the 2015 census, 34,766 people had this surname.
連
The Naju Yeon clan uses the hanja character (連, 잇닿을 연 itdaeul yeon) to denote their surname. They are the descendants of Yeon Ju, who contributed to the founding of Goryeo. According to the 2015 census, 59 people had this surname.
淵 (Extinct)
Yeon (淵) was the surname of Yeon Gaesomun, a general of Goguryeo. It became extinct when this family emigrated to the Tang dynasty, with the remaining family members changing their surname due to the naming taboo; the personal name of the first Tang emperor, Li Yuan (李淵) used the character, 淵 and it was illegal for one's surname to be the same as the emperor's name.

Michael Sandle (born 18 May 1936) is a British sculptor and artist. Their works include several public sculptures, many relating to themes of war, death, or destruction.
Early and private life
Michael Sandle was born in Weymouth, Dorset. Their father was serving in the Royal Navy, and they were christened on HMS Ark Royal. Their family's home in Plymouth was bombed in the Second World War, and they grew up on the Isle of Man, where their father had been stationed in 1942. From 1951 to 1954, they studied at Douglas School of Art and Technology on the Isle of Man, and was then conscripted for two years' National Service in the Royal Artillery.
Art career
After attending evening classes at Chester College of Art, they studied printmaking in London at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1956 to 1959, where they were taught etching by Anthony Gross, Lynton Lamb, and Ceri Richards. They were also taught by Andrew Forge, Lucian Freud, and Claude Rogers. After travelling to Italy and Paris, Sandle taught at various British art schools in the 1960s. Originally a painter and draughtsman, in the 1960s, they gravitated towards sculpture.
From 1970 to 1973, Sandle lived in Canada, where they were a visiting associate professor at the University of Calgary until 1971 and at the University of British Columbia from 1971 to 1972. In 1973, they moved to Germany, and taught in Pforzheim and Berlin. They became professor of sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Karlsruhe in 1980. From 1976 to 1982, Sandle was a member of the faculty of engraving at the British School in Rome. In 1982, they were elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1989 a full academician. After moving to Devon, they returned to London in 2003.
Works
Two of Sandle's smaller sculptural works—described as "anti-memorial"—are held by the Tate Gallery: "A Twentieth Century Memorial" (1971–78) (originally entitled "A Mickey-Mouse Machine-Gun Monument for Amerika") and one of the five casts of their work "Der Trommler" (The Drummer) (1985, cast 1987).
Their public works include:
a memorial (1985) to the victims of the crash of a US Army CH-47 in Mannheim during the city's Aeronautical Days on 11 September 1982
a large bronze statue of St George and the Dragon (1987–88) for a public square in Dorset Rise, London
the International Seafarers' Memorial (2001), outside the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization on the Albert Embankment in London
decorative plaques for a new building, La Colomberie in Saint Helier, under the Percent for Art scheme
the Siege Bell Memorial (1989–93), at the entrance to the Grand Harbour in Valletta, Malta, for which they were awarded the Henry Hering Memorial Medal by the US National Sculpture Society. The Siege Bell Memorial includes a thirteen-tonne bronze bell, "Santa Maria", one of the largest ever forged, which rings for two minutes every midday.
Sandle also worked on an unrealised project for the Battle of Britain Monument with Theo Crosby and Pedro Guedes in 1987. The plans for the 500 ft monument near Surrey Docks include a hollow pyramid containing laser-generated holograms and sounds recalling the Blitz, topped by sculptures of a Heinkel bomber and a Spitfire.
They have exhibited at the 5th Paris Biennale, the São Paulo Biennial, and the 4th and 6th Documenta in Kassel. Examples of their work are held by the Tate Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Australian National Gallery in Canberra, the Hakone Museum in Hakone, Japan, and the British Museum. A major retrospective of their work was held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1988 and then at the Wurttembergischer Kunstverein in Stuttgart in 1989.
Sandle designed the Belgrano Medal in 1986, which shows Margaret Thatcher, with the inscription "Imperatrix Impudens" ("Shameless Empress").
They have been the recipient of a number of awards, including:
Abbey Travel Award
French State Scholarship
Rodin Grand Prize, Japan's most prestigious contemporary art award, in 1986, Nobutaka Shikanai Prize, Japan
Major Prize 7th International Sculpture Exhibition, Hungary
DAAD Research Grant.
They wa a selector for The Threadneedle Prize for painting and sculpture in 2010.
Sandle was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1989, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1994. They resigned from the Royal Academy in 1997 in protest at the Sensation exhibition and the inclusion of Marcus Harvey's painting Myra, but rejoined in 2005.

Encho Keryazov () (born 15 October 1973 in Elhovo) is a Bulgarian acrobat.
Biography
Born into a family of teachers, Encho Keryazov was born in 1973 in Elhovo, Bulgaria. At the age of 6 they were a rather frail boy, so their mother had the idea of starting to train them and they began acrobatic training at a local sports club. At first they did not meet the physical prerequisites, however, their upcoming ambition and obvious talent finally convinced their trainers they were capable. At the age of 14 Keryazov was Youth Champion in Sport Acrobatics, the following year they were a member of the Bulgarian national team and national champion of sports acrobatics.
As a 16-year-old they had their first real contact with a circus and joined the jockey cavalry troupe "Romanovi" and they traveled throughout Europe for seven years.
In the following year Keryazov developed an independent equilibristics act. With the presentation of a very special handstand acrobatic act they have won prizes in England, the Netherlands, France and Germany. One of the temporary highlights of their career was winning the Audience Award and the "Silver Clown" at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo in 2007. In 2011 they received the highest award of the Bulgarian Artists Association, the "IKAR" and became an honorary citizen of their home town of Yambol.
In 2011 they founded the Foundation Encho Keryazov, with the support of other Bulgarian celebrities, which promotes talented young people engaged in science, arts and sports, giving creative and financial support. The Foundation has gained national and international attention, so that the annual awards, held since 2012 in Keryazov's hometown Yambol, where the awards are given to children and young people, are in the presence of the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kristian Vigenin, the Minister of Culture Weschdi Raschidow and ambassadors from Germany and the Netherlands. During the charity gala in January 2015 they gathered high-level international circus artists in Yambol, including the clown David Larible. The preliminary peak of their social commitment is a benefit-gala in Sofia in February 2016, which they organize with their friend and supporter of the foundation, Yordan Yovchev (Olympic gold medalist and President of the Bulgarian Sports Federation) to collect more financial resources for the Foundation.
As part of a special edition Keryazov appeared alongside other artists Circus Roncalli on an Austrian stamp.
In 2011 they were a jury member in the television show "Bulgaria's got talent". In January 2012, a 45-minute documentary about Keryazovs life and career was broadcast on the television station bTV (Bulgaria), directed by Georgi Tochev.
Their engagement at the famous Circus Roncalli in Germany and various performances, such as a sporting gala by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the USA 2012 and 2014, give Encho Keryazov consistent international recognition.
On 24 May 2012, the Day of Bulgarian Enlightenment and Culture and Slavonic Literature (this public celebratory event is closely linked to the development of the Cyrillic alphabet, Cyrillic Alphabet Day), Keryazov was at the suggestion of the Bulgarian Ministry of Culture awarded the "Golden Age" for outstanding contribution to Bulgarian culture and awarded funding of Bulgarian art and culture abroad.
Encho Keryazov has two sons, who are already working on their own acrobatic performance.
Keryazov established a successful trampoline sports club in Bulgaria. At the end of October 2013 they joined the "Palazzo" in Mannheim, Germany, for the 2014 season they were engaged at the Swiss National Circus Circus Knie and since 2015 in the United States at Vazquez Hermanos Circus.
In October 2015 they won the voting on the BUDITEL 2015, a prize awarded from the Bulgarian radio station FM Plus. The prize honors people with great spiritual impact by extraordinary social commitment for people.
Invited by Princess Stephanie of Monaco, they will participate in the anniversary show of the 40th Circus Festival in Monaco 2016 under the slogan "the best of the best".

Radio Margaritaville is a worldwide Internet radio station and SiriusXM Satellite Radio station (Ch. 24) owned by Jimmy Buffett. It features 24-hour music and live broadcasts of Jimmy Buffett's concerts.
History
Buffett was inspired to create Radio Margaritaville after listening to radio stations in Australia, Key West, and to WOYS in Apalachicola, Florida. They were attracted to the channels' wide range of programming, as opposed to the homogenized playlists they heard elsewhere. They contacted an old friend, Steve Huntington, who agreed to leave terrestrial radio to serve as program director for Buffett's new venture. "When we first started talking about this, we didn't know the Internet would be the route," Huntington said in a 2001 interview. "We figured it would be done in syndication or something. But we started doing some shows on the main Margaritaville site in 1998 and the response was very good." Buffett modeled the channel after pirate radio stations in terms of having no restrictions on what songs to play. It also recalled free-form FM radio of the 1970s with diverse playlists featuring music in the rock, jazz, blues, and folk genres. By 2002, Radio Margaritaville was one of the most popular Internet stations, though it had yet to build an audience that would rival small-market radio stations.
Radio Margaritaville joined Sirius Satellite Radio in 2005 on channel 31 (moving to XM 24 May 4, 2011) and Dish Network channel 6031. It became the first internet station to transition to mainstream radio, and can also be heard on radio. On November 12, 2008, following the merger of Sirius and XM Radio, the station was added to the XM lineup at channel 55 (moving to XM 24 May 4, 2011). Radio Margaritaville's program director is Kirsten Winquist and the General Manager is Coleman Sisson. On air talent consists of hosts Kirsten Winquist (VP Programming), Sara West, Jasmine Shinness, Renee Adams, and JD Spradlin. The station is broadcast from The Margaritaville Resort locations in Orlando and Nashville. Radio Margaritaville now has a stinger often heard between songs of a steel drum with a few notes of "Margaritaville", adding to station identity.
SiriusXM's station, "The Highway," added a Friday afternoon-drive program, Music Row Happy Hour, to its lineup in 2016. Hosted by Buzz Brainard, the show is broadcast from the Margaritaville Restaurant in Nashville and has featured visits from such artists as Brett Eldredge, Maren Morris, and Blake Shelton. The show "created a natural cross-promotion with Jimmy Buffett's Radio Margaritaville channel." As of August 2017, Radio Margaritaville averages three million unique listeners a week.

The Little Willamette River is a minor tributary of the Willamette River in Linn County in the U.S. state of Oregon. It begins in a gravel pit slightly east of the main stem in a bend of the larger river west of Albany. Flowing generally northeast and roughly parallel to the main stem for about , it enters the Willamette about from the larger river's mouth on the Columbia River.
Along its lower course, the Little Willamette flows through Bowers Rock State Park, a tract in a riparian forest. The park, largely undeveloped, with primitive trails and no amenities, is part of the Willamette Greenway. The only named tributary of the Little Willamette is Coon Creek, which enters from the left.

Johnny Favourite Swing Orchestra was a Canadian swing revival band, active in the late 1990s.
Formed in Halifax, Nova Scotia by jazz singer Stuart "Johnny Favourite" Bastow, the band released its debut album The Life Desire independently in 1997.
Other band members included John Wesley Chisholm, Wes Mackey Jr., Colin Hudson, Pete Johnston, Matt Myer, Craig Sheppard, "Hound Dog" Dave Fitzgerald, Eric Landry, David Christensen, Dawn Hatfield and Andrew Killawee.
They won an East Coast Music Award for Best Jazz Group in 1998, and signed to Universal Records that year. Soon afterward, however, Chisholm left the band after the birth of their second child; they subsequently received two Genie Award nominations, for both Best Original Song and Best Original Score, for their work composing music for the film Beefcake.
The band's second album, Holiday Romance, was released in fall 1998.
By this time the band was a popular touring act, whose live show included original material, jazz standards and covers of classic and hard rock songs by bands such as Led Zeppelin and The Band. They garnered radio and MuchMusic airplay for singles such as "Rootbeer & Licorice" and "We Still Talk". "Rootbeer & Licorice" charted on the Adult Contemporary charts in RPM, peaking at #32 the week of January 11, 1999.
The band won the Juno Award for Best New Group at the Juno Awards of 1999.
Because the band had up to 14 members at various times, it underwent frequent personnel changes and internal tensions. The band broke up following a show in Halifax in early 2000; Bastow continued to use the name Johnny Favourite as a solo artist, and released their first solo album The Tonight Album in fall 2000. Five of the former Swing Orchestra bandmembers continued as their solo backing band. They moved to Portugal for several years in the 2000s, before returning to Canada near the end of the decade; their second solo album, Troubadour, was released in 2010.

The 2015 Seville City Council election, also the 2015 Seville municipal election, was held on Sunday, 24 May 2015, to elect the 10th City Council of the municipality of Seville. All 31 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain.
Electoral system
The City Council of Seville () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Seville, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years.
Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age, registered and residing in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:
The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee would be determined by lot.
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.
Opinion polls
The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The "Lead" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font; 16 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Seville (17 until 1 January 2015).

Sir Emmanuel Neville Cenac (born 24 November 1939) is the former governor-general of Saint Lucia. They were appointed to that post in January 2018. On 28 July 2021 Cenac is reported to have signalled their intention to resign. As of 31 October, they demitted the viceregal office. They were previously best known as a Saint Lucian politician, serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1987 to 1992.
On 18 January 2018, Cenac was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 2018 Special Honours.
Also in 2018, Cenac was appointed Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Lucia (GCSL), in their capacity as Chancellor of the Order.
Family
Cenac was the brother of Prime Minister Winston Cenac, who was the head of government for eight months from 1981 to 1982.
Opposition parliamentarian
Cenac was the leader of the opposition Saint Lucia Labour Party in December 1982, during a constitutional dispute over the status of Governor-General Boswell Williams. John Compton, the serving prime minister and a member of the governing United Workers Party, had taken steps to have Williams unseated. In response, Cenac wrote a letter to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, the monarch of Saint Lucia, asking them to disregard Compton's actions. The dispute ended when Williams resigned on 13 December 1982.
Cenac was returned as a Labour Party member of the Saint Lucian parliament during the country's two successive elections in April 1987.
The website of the Saint Lucia Labour Party indicates that Cenac was elected for the Laborie constituency in two elections as well as representing the party at the municipal level in Castries.
Cabinet minister
Cenac changed their political affiliation on 2 June 1987, joining the United Workers Party group in parliament and becoming the country's foreign minister. When asked why they changed sides, Cenac simply responded, "broken promises". The change increased the Workers Party's legislative majority from one vote (9-8) to three votes (10-7).
Cenac spoke before the United Nations General Assembly in October 1987, saying that Saint Lucia was considering political union with other small Caribbean nations. They argued that quality of life issues could be improved if the region no longer had to support "seven governors-general, seven prime ministers, [and] 60 ministers for a total population for about 500,000." Cenac also accused Guatemala of threatening the sovereignty of Belize.
In August 1989, Cenac and other Caribbean foreign ministers met with Haitian head of state General Prosper Avril on the subject of future elections in the country.
Cenac served as foreign minister until 1992. They were later president of the Senate of Saint Lucia from October 1993 to June 1997.

In enzymology, a 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate 5-carboxy-2-oxohept-3-enedioate
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate, and one product, 5-carboxy-2-oxohept-3-enedioate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate Delta2,Delta4-2-oxo,Delta3-isomerase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and benzoate degradation via hydroxylation.

Democrat, originally Democrat Hill, is a former settlement in Nevada County, California. It lay on the Chalk Bluff ridge, about 1 mile south of what is now Highway 20, about 6 miles southeast of the town of Washington and about 1 mile east of Remington Hill. Its elevation was 4170 feet (1271 m). It lay on a gold bearing gravel channel on the Chalk Bluff Ridge, which lies between Steephollow and Greenhorn Creeks, tributaries of the Bear River. As the channel runs southwest, it joins a major channel running from the San Juan Ridge easterly through Red Dog and You Bet into Placer County.
It was established in 1856 as Democrat Hill by miners who struck it rich in the area. As a local newspaper reported:
"[N]ew diggings have been struck about a mile from Remington Hill, that are exceeding (sic) rich. Three men took out four ounces and four dollars in one day, in addition to paying water money. The diggings have been named Democrat Hill."
The extent of subsequent mining activity is unclear. In 1874, Raymond reported drift and hydraulic mining in the area. In 1880, the Wick Brothers were working a small hydraulic claim there. Hydraulic mining largely disappeared In California following the Sawyer decision in 1884.
Democrat Hill appears on J. G. Hartwell's 1880 map of Nevada County and in its list of mines. On the 1898 Colfax quadrangle map and on the 1909 California State Mining Bureau map of Nevada County, it appears as Democrat. The author has been unable to find any explanation for the origin of the name or the dropping of "Hill", but presumably the name alludes to the political affiliation of the 1856 miners.
Presently, the area is in a remote and largely uninhabited part of the Tahoe National Forest.

The orange-eyed flatbill or orange-eyed flycatcher (Tolmomyias traylori) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in the Amazon (specifically in várzea forest) in south-eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, and north-eastern Peru. First recognized as a species due to its distinct voice, it was only described in 1997; the binomial commemorates the American ornithologist Melvin Alvah Traylor Jr. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the conservation status of this species as being of "least concern".
Description
The orange-eyed flatbill grows to a length of about . It has olive upper parts and a greyish crown. The facial area, throat and chest are greyish-buff and the belly yellowish. The iris is orange, and this and the buff throat is distinctive and helps distinguish this bird from other species in the genus. The song is a series of five to seven notes "zhreee", more extended and more rasping than the yellow-breasted flatbill (Tolmomyias flaviventris). The flatbills in this genus are difficult to tell apart and are most easily recognised by their song.
Distribution and habitat
The orange-eyed flatbill is found in northwestern Amazonia, its range extending from southeastern Colombia, through eastern Ecuador to northeastern Peru. It appears to replace the yellow-olive flatbill (Tolmomyias sulphurescens) to the north of the Amazon River and is also present on large islands in the river. It favours the mid-storey of moderately-high and tall, seasonally-flooded Várzea forest. It is usually seen by itself or in pairs, and seldom joins mixed flocks. Like other members of the genus, the bag-shaped nest has a tubular entrance near the base and is often hung near a wasp nest.
Status
The orange-eyed flatbill has a very wide range in western Amazonia and is an uncommon species. The population trend is unknown, but the bird is likely to be declining due to deforestation in the area. Nevertheless, the rate of decline is insufficient for the trend to approach the threshold criteria for rating the bird as "vulnerable", so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being a "least-concern species".

Cameraria lobatiella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from British Columbia in Canada, and California in the United States.
The length of the forewings is 2.8-3.8 mm.
The larvae feed on Quercus douglasii, Quercus kelloggii and Quercus lobata. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is found on the upperside of the leaf. It has an irregular shape. The epidermis is opaque, red brown and usually extends across the leaf midrib. It is a solitary species, but may coalesce with more than one adult eclosing. Normally, there are two parallel folds present. Pupae in mines of the last generation each season overwinter and eclose the following spring after their host's new leaves have expanded.
Etymology
The name of the species is derived from the specific name of its principal host, Quercus lobata.

The Hospital Clínico San Carlos is a hospital located at the Ciudad Universitaria neighborhood in Madrid, Spain, part of hospital network of the Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS).
It is one of the healthcare institutions associated to the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) for the purpose of clinical internship.
History
It is the successor of the namesake Hospital de San Carlos located near the calle de Atocha and inaugurated on 1 October 1787. The idea for the new building dates back to 1927, during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Following a project by Manuel Sánchez Arcas (with Eduardo Torroja as structural engineer), the building works started in 1932, during the Second Republic. The project stood out by the beamless slabs of the cantilevered balconies and by the cover of the operating rooms (both elements unseen in Spain up to that date). The hospital was still unfinished by the time of the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, when the Ciudad Universitaria became part of the frontline. Reconstruction works were resumed in 1941. Despite the hospital started operations on 20 January 1951, as the chair of General Pathology was transferred then from Atocha, building works lasted until 1967, when the last services provided at the old hospital were finally transferred to the new building.
As of 2019 it has 861 beds.

Elegy of the Uprooting is a double CD live album by Greek composer Eleni Karaindrou featuring music recorded in 2005 and released on the ECM New Series label.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 5 stars stating "Karaindrou is a giant. In their quiet way they tower over more popular figures, simply by digging through the historical, cultural, and musical past, through the images brought forth by them, and by the poetics of the human heart. There is no hollow sentimentality in this work. In fact, it is stripped of that artifice to reach the purity of emotion, presented by a composer and musicians who understand restraint, allowing the story presented here to reveal itself, not by narrative so much as by context and the honesty of the music itself. Without doubt, this is the modern classical recording of 2006 and will go down as a classic in the field".

Élise Voïart, (1786-1866) was a writer and translator from Nancy, France, specializing in historical works, fiction and children's books. They held literary salons at their home when they lived near Paris.
Biography
Élise was born 10 February 1786, Anne-Élisabeth-Élise Petitpain, in Nancy, France, the oldest of eight children. Them father was the organist at the Cathedral in Nancy but died at a young age. Élise expanded their knowledge of German by assisting their stepfather M. Wouters, a local manufacturer, with their business. In 1807, Monsignor Antoine Eustache d'Osmond, had the idea of having them admitted to the court of Josephine, which resulted in the Empress giving the young lady a pension of 500 francs and the hope of being admitted to a special secondary school for daughters of recipients of the Legion of Honor, called Écouen.
Élise intended to enter Écouen, but at 20, they met and married a widower thirty years older, Jacques-Philippe Voïart, food administrator at Les Invalides and art lover who already had two daughters, including the future poet Amable Tastu (1795-1885) whose literacy education Élise nurtured.
The new couple had one child, a daughter, Élisabeth Voïart (c. 1814-1875), who became a pastellist artist. The Voïart family took up residence in Choisy-le-Roi outside Paris, where Élise ran a liberal-minded salon frequented by Adélaïde-Gillette Dufrénoy, "la Sapho française," the popular singer Béranger, and the artist couple Pierre-Paul Prud'hon and Constance Mayer who painted a portrait of Élise Voïart that is held at the Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy.
Translations
The first publications of Élise Voïart (sometimes spelled Voyart) were translations from German and English into French. They produced 30 volumes between 1817 and 1821; most were sentimental novels by August Lafontaine, which they did not hesitate to revise, thus appropriating the writing. For Fridolin by Friedrich Schiller, however, Élise opted instead to stick rigorously to the text, saying it was the only way to make "the touching and naive simplicity inherent to the character and the German language." In doing so, they freed the work from rhyme, thus promoting free verse poetry.
Novels
Élise Voïart's first historical novel, The Virgin of Arduene, described the passage of Gaul under Roman rule during the reign of Augustus. It became part of the romantic movement to rediscover France's past. A review of the work by Auguste Lafontaine describes the author's strong female characters."Élisa Voïart enthusiastically painted this ancient Gaul where women were almost deified. Struck with the influence that in all times their sex exerted on our mores, they sought the origin, and thought they found it based on religious principles, passed out in the wave of centuries, but preserved until today by popular traditions: the Gauls and the Germans, according to Tacitus, attributed something divine to their wives; recognition and love, continues Voïart, made this cult lasting."Élise also wrote commissioned works intended for the Ladies ' Encyclopedia (Letters on the ladies' toilet, 1821; Essay on ancient and modern dance, 1823).
Young adult works
At the beginning of the 1830s, Voïart wrote for the booming educational and feminine press, contributing to the Journal des dames, the Journal des Demoiselles and the Journal des jeunes personnes. In the process of supporting their stepdaughter, the poet Amable Tastu during the bankruptcy of their husband's printing business, together they begin to collect fairy tales. Eager to promote national cultures, they translated the Popular Songs of the Servians (1834).
Last years
In 1836, the Voïarts offered their hospitality to the aging and bankrupt Rouget de Lisle, famous for writing the words and music of the French national anthem, the Marseillaise. (He died at 76 in Choisy-le-Roi.)
After their husband's death in 1842, Élise Voïart moved back to their birthplace, Nancy, where they composed historical Lorraine novels and earned them the status of "the Walter Scott of Lorraine." They also signed a series of novels for the collection of the “Library of little children” created by the Catholic publisher Alfred Mame in 1845. In children's literature dominated by “a massive production of bland and bland moral stories,” Voïart's stories are distinguished by a precise observation of the world of childhood and the staging of autonomous female characters.
Accolades
For their novel The Woman, or the six loves, Voïart was honored by the French Academy with the Montyon Prize in 1828.
Voïart growing notoriety caused them to be included in collections such as Montferrand's Femmes célèbres (1843) and the Book of the Hundred and one by Pierre-François Ladvocat, where they are listed among the most prominent literary figures.
In 1868, Voïart was elected an associate member of the Stanislas Academy, the first woman to be so honored.
Death
Voïart died on 22 January 1866 in Nancy at the age of 79.
Critiques
The literary critic Sainte-Beuve wrote condescendingly about Voïart's work, citing their "young, gifted (...) taste and talent for writing, known by several nice books." However, their books and translations have been held in libraries continuously since the 1821. As of 2017, Worldcat.org lists 235 works in 523 publications in 4 languages could be found in libraries worldwide.

The Red Line (Punainen viiva) is an opera in two acts with music by Aulis Sallinen to a libretto by the composer, which premiered on 30 November 1978 at the Finnish National Opera.
Based on the 1909 novel Punainen viiva by Ilmari Kianto (1874–1970), the opera – like the novel – is set in 1907, a watershed year in Finnish history during which its first elections were held, leading eventually to Finnish independence in 1917.
Performance history
Outside Finland, the opera was performed at several European opera houses, including Sadler's Wells Theatre, London in June 1979, Göteborg and Stockholm in 1980, Zürich in 1981, Moscow, Leningrad and Tallinn in 1982, and in Osnabrück and Dortmund in May 1985, as well as at the Metropolitan Opera of New York in 1983. It has been revived several times in Helsinki and was recorded in November 1979 by Finlandia. A DVD of Finnish National Opera's 2007 stage production conducted by Mikko Franck has been issued by Ondine.
Roles
Synopsis
North Finnish province of Kainuu; the croft of Topi and their family
Act 1
Scene 1
It is late autumn; a bear, symbol of the threat of brutal nature, is heard nearby; it has carried off one of their sheep. As Topi promises to slay the bear, they argue with their wife, both feel trapped by their poor life and realise that they have barely any food remaining for the family. Topi believes that things will change for the better.
Scene 2
Topi dreams that they have gone to the village to ask for help for children, but, admonished by the vicar for not attending church, aid arrives too late and their children are dead. Topi awakes, terrified by their dream, but takes some birds to exchange for grain and sets off to the village. Riika regrets having called Topi names.
Scene 3
A pedlar enters, Simana Arhippaini from Karelia, tells the children riddles and sings a ballad, but cannot answer their serious questions. Topi returns and gets Kunilla to read to them from a socialist newspaper, and talks about ‘an election', a possible way of release from their toil and poverty without understanding the importance of it.
New Year
Scene 4
An agitator addresses an open-air meeting. Despite interruptions from a young priest, they proclaim social democracy and tells of freedom, equality and fraternity. The people are slowly aware of the meaning of the vote.
Act 2
Twelfth Night
Scene 5
Neighbours join Topi and Riika to celebrate Twelfth Night. Riika reads from a socialist tract; all will be voting in the election but Topi, having only ever held axes and spades in their hands, wonders how they will make their mark — a red line — on the ballot paper. As they are discussing the future, dogs start barking, aware that the bear is turning in their sleep, but the people can't sense this.
Fifteenth of March
Scene 6
Outside the polling-booth a confrontation takes place between the young priest and their choir, and the socialist organiser and their group. The voters are checked as they enter to vote. Topi and Riika go in.
Later in the spring
Scene 7
Topi is at the logging camp; Riika anxiously clears fresh tracks in the snow for them every day, hoping for their return. They desperately long for word that the election has changed their lives; but no one comes.
The children have all fallen ill from malnutrition. Kaisi tells Riika it is a punishment; when Topi returns they have all died. The vicar agrees to bury them for a reduced price, as they can all fit in a single coffin.
Epilogue
The message comes that the election has been won by the ordinary people. There is the promise of better clothes, food and health, but it is too late for Topi and Riika. Then dogs bark, warning of the bear, which has awakened. Topi goes to fight it, but they are killed and Riika finds them dead, and cries out in horror over their corpse, with blood pouring out of their throat, in a red line.
The music
Grove notes the careful structuring of mood via the music with lyricism in the opening scenes, pastiche folk music where needed and a choral confrontation between the old (folk melody) and the new (revolutionary fervour).
Bush describes the music as "expertly composed and elegantly orchestrated", and commends scenes 4 and 6, and the orchestral interludes. Another writer commented that in this "grim opera" the very intense dramatic effect of the music may be due to its generally low-key approach.

The Orange County Water District is a special district that manages the groundwater basin beneath central and northern Orange County, California. The groundwater basin provides a water supply to 19 municipal water agencies and special districts that serve more than 2.4 million Orange County residents. The Orange County Water District's service area covers approximately and the District owns approximately in and near the Santa Ana River, which it uses to capture water flows for groundwater recharge. Additionally, the Orange County Water District owns approximately of land above the Prado Dam in the Prado Reservoir and uses that land for water conservation, water storage and water quality improvements. The water district's administrative offices and the Groundwater Replenishment System facilities are located in Fountain Valley, while it also operates various groundwater recharge facilities located in Anaheim and Orange.
History
The Orange County Water District was formed by an act of the California State Legislature in 1933. The District Act was signed on June 14 of that year by Governor James Rolph, Jr.
The Orange County Water District was designated as an Orange County Historical Civil Engineering Landmark in 2006.
Facilities
Groundwater Replenishment System
The Groundwater Replenishment System takes highly treated wastewater from the Orange County Sanitation District and purifies it using microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light with hydrogen peroxide. This produces high-quality water that exceeds state and federal drinking water standards. The GWRS has been operational since January 2008 and initially produced up to 70 million gallons of water daily. After the completion of an upgrade in 2015, the plant produced 100 million gallons per day with an expansion to provide up to 130 million approved on September 21, 2016.
The Orange County Water and Sanitation Districts were awarded the Stockholm Industry Water Award in 2008 for pioneering work to develop the Groundwater Replenishment System, the world's largest water purification plant for groundwater recharge.
Groundwater recharge facilities
The Orange County Water District operates groundwater recharge facilities in the Cities of Anaheim and Orange. A 30-year lease agreement was approved in January 2013 to allow the district to construct an injection water well and well facilities at the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center.

Shanghai Science and Technology Museum is a large museum in Pudong, Shanghai, close to Century Park, the largest park within the inner districts of the city. It is one of China's most-visited museums. It received 1,351,000 visitors in 2020, despite a fall of attendance of 72 percent from 2019 due to restrictions and reduced tourism imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
History
Century Square was built in 1995, and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum was planned for its western side as a key project for popularizing science in the Yangtze Delta region. As part of the Huamu Civic Center, it was also intended to help drive Pudong's continued development away from Lujiazui and other neighborhoods along the banks of the Huangpu River. The museum completed its conference and meeting halls in time to host the APEC Leaders' Meeting on 20 & 21 October 2001, receiving Chinese paramount leader Jiang Zemin, Russian president Vladimir Putin, and US president George W. Bush.
The Science and Technology Museum completed its first phase of construction and opened its exhibits to the general public on 18 December 2001. Its initial themes were the harmony of nature, humankind, and technology (, Zìrán, Rén, Kējì) and its first five exhibition halls were devoted to "Heaven and Earth", "Life", "Wisdom", "Creativity", and "the Future".
The second phase of the project opened in May 2005, at which time it was the first science and technology museum authenticated to meet ISO 9000/14000 quality and environmental standards. Between its opening and 2010, it attracted 19.5 million visitors. The children's area and Light of Wisdom exhibition were renovated from January to May 2010, ahead of the Shanghai World Expo held that year. Initially named a AAAA-rated tourist attraction by the CNTA, the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum has since been upgraded to AAAAA status. US president Barack Obama held a town hall meeting with Shanghainese students at the Science and Technology Museum on 16 November 2009 during their state visit.
Administration
The SSTM is not a purely public institution, but a foundation under public administration funded by private businesses in Shanghai. These include the Pudong Development Bank, the Shanghai Science and Technology Investment Corporation, Beijing Zhijin Venture Capital, and Top Group. The foundation also administers other scientific museums in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Natural History Museum and Shanghai Planetarium.
Architecture
The original design of the museum was managed by Shanghai-based Creative Star Digital, who planned it to accommodate 2–3 million visitors per year. It cost 3.75 billion ($180 million) with an investment of 1,755 billion. The museum building is an ascending spiral rising from one to five floors, intended to symbolize scientific and technological progress. The enormous glass sphere at its center denotes the rise of life out of water. Its grounds cover an area of , with a floor space of . of this is used for the exhibition space. The museum's HVAC was digitized and advanced enough for It's time that it was once considered for a separate exhibit of its own.
As part of Pudong's Huamu Civic Center, the museum building helps anchor the southern end of the district's principal thoroughfare Century Avenue, facing onto the Century Square, with its underground shopping area and subway station. Century Park lies nearby and, together, the complex has helped rebrand the district and encourage luxury housing developments in the surrounding area.
Exhibitions
The museum is dedicated to the popularization of science, with an intended theme of the harmony of "Nature, Mankind, and Technology". Like the overall building design, the original exhibits were designed by Creative Star Digital.
It has 14 main permanent exhibitions and 4 science-themed cinemas. The exhibitions are:
Spectrum of Life: A natural exhibit which imitates the scenery of Yunnan Province and displays its diversity of creatures.
Earth Exploration
Cradle of Design or Designers where visitors can use CAD/CAM to design and build small things
Children's Rainbow Land
Light of Wisdom
Home on Earth

The Chinese Ancient Science and Technology Gallery showcases ancient Chinese inventions and works. The Explorers' Gallery features Chinese and foreign explorers. The Academicians' Gallery features contemporary scientists from China, particularly Shanghai.
There was previously also an "Audio-Visual Discovery Paradise", s small-scale hydroelectric power station, a rain forest, an aviary, an aquarium, and an earthquake center including a motive platform with video allowing visitors to experience simulated tremors. The exhibitions are intended to "represent cutting-edge scientific development" using "innovative and unique exhibition methods" but many have not been updated since their installation. This behavior is common in China, where museums often subcontract all their exhibits' designs to private firms without any longterm arrangement to maintain or update them.
There are also two temporary exhibition halls.
The museum opened with 2 IMAX cinemas. With the later addition of another two, the cineplex is the largest dedicated to science education in Asia, with 10,000 showtimes each year. They are:
IMAX 3D Theater
IMAX Dome Theater
IWERKS Theater
Space Theater
Hours of Operation
The museum is open from 09:00 to 17:15. It is closed on Monday (except holidays).
Transportation
The Shanghai Science and Technology Museum Station is a stop on Line 2 of the Shanghai Metro. Pudian Rd. Station on Line 4 is also within walking distance. The site also has a bus stop served by several routes, including Routes 794 and 640.
Popular media
The promotional video for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 shot several scenes on location in and around the Science and Technology Museum. Its futuristic appearance has made it a common setting for Chinese media.
There are many scenes filmed at the museum in the Chinese movie Kung Fu Dunk, starring Jay Chou. The Indian movie Chandni Chowk to China also filmed some scenes at the SSTM.
The museum was the Pit Stop for Leg 10 of the TV series The Amazing Race 16.

Azimullah Khan (17 September 1830 — 18 March 1859), also known as Dewan Azimullah Khan, was initially appointed Secretary, and later Prime Minister (hence the prefix Dewan) to Shrimant Nana Saheb Peshwa II.  They are also known as the Krantidoot Azimullah Khan (Krantidoot in Hindi for "Ambassador of Revolution").
Azimullah Khan was involved in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, primarily ideologically, influencing important nobles such as Shrimant Nana Saheb Peshwa II.
Origins
Azimullah was rescued as a starving Muslim boy from the famine of 1837-38 along with their mother when they were provided shelter at a mission in Kanpur. There they learnt English but also French, no mean achievement for an Indian in the 19th century.
After working as secretary to several British officers, they were taken into the service of the Shrimant Nana Saheb Peshwa II, adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao II (died 28 January 1851), as secretary and advisor.
The Maratha mission
Nana Sahib was involved in an extended appeal to the British East India Company to pass on to them the £80,000 annual pension that their adoptive father (exiled to the Kingdom of Oudh) had been granted. While Nana Sahib had inherited Peshwa Baji Rao's property and title, the pension paid by the Company had terminated on the latter's death. Nana Sahib chose Azimullah to lead a delegation to England in 1853 to plead their case with the Board of Control and the British Government.
England
In England, Azimullah was taken under the wing of Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon; an intellectual and translator whose husband was a civil servant, court functionary and the cousin of the then Prime Minister. This introduction probably came about through the philosopher John Stuart Mill, who was an official of the East India Company and had been a childhood friend of Lucie's. Azimullah lodged with the Duff Gordons at their home in Esher, and in Lucie's company may have met their friends Dickens, Carlyle, Meredith, Tennyson, Browning and Thackeray (though there is no direct evidence).
The mission to obtain resumption of the pension for Nana Sahib was unsuccessful and reportedly embittered Azimullah Khan.
Constantinople
On their way back, Azimullah's party stopped in Constantinople, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. There they met with the Times correspondent William Howard Russell, who noted the young Muslim official's interest in the losses and setbacks suffered by the British Army. Azimullah is reported to have contacted Turkish and Russian spies.
Subversion and revolt
Although their mission had failed, they probably came back with a more dangerous idea, planting in the Nana Sahib's mind the seed of the Indian rebellion of 1857. (Azimullah also brought back a French printing press, which was used – by others – to print and distribute subversive literature against the British in India.)
Azimullah's own role in the great uprising that followed, the "Indian Mutiny", was political rather than military. Although they were a chief advisor to the Nana Sahib, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion, they were a Muslim at a Hindu court, a talker, at a time when military men were needed, and without personal wealth, nobility, or a following of supporters, and so they soon became a marginal figure. They did however play a key role in the negotiations that terminated the Siege of Cawnpore. Representing Nana Sahib, Azimullah met with the British commander of the garrison Major-General Sir Hugh Wheeler and agreement was reached that the garrison and their families would be evacuated and taken by boat to safety in Allahabad. The following day they were seen among a group of Nana Sahib's advisers and officers who were present at the ambush and killing of most of the refugees as they boarded the waiting boats.
Death
Azimullah Khan probably died of a fever in late 1859, after the crushing of the rebellion, on the run from the British in the inhospitable border country of the Nepalese Terai. Other accounts have them dying of smallpox while attempting to reach Calcutta in disguise, or of escaping India and eventually being murdered in Constantinople. Azimullah Avenue, a road in Kanpur is named in their honour.
In popular culture
Azimullah Khan was portrayed by actor Shahbaz Khan in the 2005 movie Mangal Pandey: The Rising.

The Chinese thrush (Turdus mupinensis) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae. It is found in China and far northern Vietnam. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
A recent molecular study places the Chinese thrush's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged European species, the song thrush (T. philomelos) and the mistle thrush (T. viscivorus), all three species early offshoots from the main Turdus radiation around the world.

The Well is a British horror series that was first broadcast in October 2009 on BBC Two in the BBC Switch Saturday afternoon slot. It was written by Melvin Burgess and is the first project they have written for television and online platforms. The story comprises four ten-minute episodes and three levels of an online game where the audience can explore an online simulation of the main location, a haunted house, playing games and unlocking a backstory that relates back to the main story within the television episodes.
Plot
The Well is the story of four teenagers; Beth (Jo Woodcock), Luis (Gregory Foreman), Coll (Karen Gillan) and Ivan (Isaac Ssebandeke) who accidentally uncover a cursed Celtic well and release an evil spirit into the world. The teenagers must discover how to restore order before one of them is killed by the evil hag that they have disturbed, who has already killed a young girl called Bethany who features in the online platform of the show.
Characters
Beth (Jo Woodcock): Beth is the leader of the gang. They have a soft spot for Ivan. Them brother is Luis who is very much the complete opposite of them They suffer from nightmares which are disturbingly vivid and tries to cover up their fear by being very cocky and pretending to be really cool.
Coll (Karen Gillan): Coll is the most sensible of all of the gang and is extremely intelligent. However, despite their pretty looks, every time they perform well in their exams boys seem to hate them even more especially Luis, much to their disappointment.  They are the one most eager to solve the mystery of the well and doesn't give up.
Online
The Well uses an approach of telling a story across different platforms, namely television and online. Although the story can be understood as a four-part television drama, in-between episodes the audience can go online and gain access to the backstory.
The online story is set in the 1800s and crosses over into the present day story that unfolds concurrently on television. By exploring a three dimensional replica of the house and completing a series of games, the audience are rewarded with a new piece of the backstory which is told to them by ghosts. Each section of story that is unlocked builds to reveal a tale of a young girl called Bethany who also disturbed the well and was eventually killed by the hag.
Special features
When the phone number from the show is dialed from a mobile phone, the phone will receive specialized text messages related to the series.
Producers
The Well was created by Liverpool-based digital media company Conker Media for BBC Switch. The 3D house was created by Milky Tea and the online games by Splinter Design Communications.

The Boyce Thompson Institute (previously: Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research) is an independent research institute devoted to using plant sciences to improve agriculture, protect the environment, and enhance human health. The Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI) is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, United States, and is fully integrated in the research infrastructure of the university. Faculty at BTI are members of several Cornell Departments, including Plant Biology, Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Molecular Biology & Genetics, as well as Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology. BTI is governed by a Board of Directors, which is in part appointed by Cornell.
History
William Boyce Thompson became wealthy from the copper mining industry and visited Russia in 1917, where they saw the effects of hunger on its people. This trip persuaded Thompson of the importance of ensuring food supply for the world population, and in 1920, they decided to establish the Institute for Plant Research. They wanted the institute to further the understanding of plants, to use this understanding for improving world food supply, and to promote conservation of natural areas.
The founding managing director was William Crocker, an associate professor of plant physiology at the University of Chicago who along with Herbert Hice Whetzel had been academic advisers to Thompson when they planned the institute.
Yonkers
Thompson named the institute in honor of their parents, Anne Boyce Thompson and William Thompson, and endowed it with $10 million. Subsequently, the BTI has been funded by government support and revenues from the licensing of institute patents. Thompson played an active role in the early years of BTI and sought to encourage commercial development of the institute's research results. Therefore, rather than locating BTI on a university campus, Thompson built the laboratories in 1924 across the street from their country estate Alder Manor, in Yonkers, New York.
The Yonkers campus, used by BTI until the 1970s, was leased out for use as late as 1997, and then sold to the City of Yonkers Board of Education in 1999. In 2015 the city sold the property for $4.25 million to Simone Development Cos. the plans for the campus were to re-develop it into a mixed-use center with medical offices, restaurants and retail stores.
Cornell University
BTI remained on its Yonkers campus until the 1970s, when Yonkers property taxes and urban pollution posed major problems. Managing Director George L. McNew favored an affiliation with a major research university, and soon a 'bidding war' broke out between Oregon State University and Cornell University to attract BTI. The New York State Legislature wanted to keep BTI in New York and appropriated $8.5 million for construction of facilities on the Cornell campus if BTI agreed to stay. Oregon also appropriated funds as a relocation incentive. Ultimately, it was decided that affiliation with Cornell offered the most varied research opportunities.
In 1978 a new building designed by Ulrich Franzen was built next to the Cornell Veterinary School, and the move was made. Although affiliated with Cornell, the institute maintains its independence with a separate endowment, Board of Directors, business office, and employee benefits program. Close ties between BTI and Cornell foster collaborative relationships.
In 2015, in an effort to revamp the brand, the institute changed its name from Boyce Thompson Institute of Plant Research to Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI).
Programs
BTI has 16 faculty investigators conducting plant research and training graduate students and post doctoral fellows. The Scientist magazine survey of post doctoral fellows ranked BTI the 12th best place to work. For example, BTI is part of the consortium that is sequencing the tomato genome and creating a database of genomic sequences and information on the tomato and related plants.
Each summer, BTI's 10-week Plant Genome Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program enables undergraduates selected nationally to conduct individual research. BTI also runs after-school science enrichment programs at local grade schools.
BTI's research facilities, including the BTI Mass Spectrometry Facility and the Plant Cell Imaging Center, are available to researchers from Cornell University and SUNY Cortland.
Technology Transfer
HighFive Technology
The HighFive cell line was originally developed at BTI. The cell line and its virus-free sub-clones remain the sole property of BTI. The High Five cells have been used to produce the VLP-based HPV vaccine Cervarix.
Ascribe Bioscience
Ascribe Bioscience is a startup based on a BTI technology. Ascribe Bioscience was founded in Ithaca, NY in 2017 by Frank Schroeder, Daniel Klessig, Murli Manohar, and Jay Farmer.

Rory Holden (born 23 August 1997) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Port Vale.
A Northern Ireland under-21 international, they began their career at Derry City, making their first-team debut in May 2016. They were sold to English club Bristol City in August 2017, and from there they were loaned out to Barrow and Rochdale in the 2018–19 season. They spent the 2019–20 campaign on loan at Walsall and joined the club on a permanent basis in August 2020. However they picked up a long-term knee injury four months later and missed much of the 2020–21 season and the entirety of the 2021–22 campaign. They joined Port Vale in July 2022.
Club career
Derry City
Holden began their career with Derry City, first joining as a 14-year old. They made their first-team debut on 29 May 2016 when they came on as an 81st-minute substitute for Keith Ward in a 2–0 win over Bray Wanderers at the Brandywell Stadium. They were given a three-year professional contract by manager Kenny Shiels. They earned their first start on 28 October, in a 2–0 victory at St Patrick's Athletic. Having featured four times in the 2016 season, they played another nine League of Ireland Premier Division games in the 2017 season, and scored their first senior goal in a 4–0 home win over Sligo Rovers on 9 July.
Bristol City
On 30 August 2017, Holden signed with English Championship club Bristol City after a successful trial spell. They had impressed manager Lee Johnson in two trials and the "Robins" agreed to a transfer-deadline day deal worth up to €300,000. However they never played a first-team game at Ashton Gate.
They joined Barrow on a one-month loan, starting on 14 September 2018. They played five National League games for Ian Evatt's "Bluebirds". They joined League Two club Rochdale on loan for the rest of the 2018–19 season on 3 January 2019. Manager Keith Hill said that "it's important we get players in who have the right mentality and who have the right game brain and intelligent energy, and Rory fits the bill". They played seven matches for Rochdale. They signed a new two-year contract with City in June 2019, with the club retaining a further 12-month option.
Walsall
On 26 July 2019, they joined League Two club Walsall on a season-long loan following a trial period. They made 36 appearances in the 2019–20 season, and though they played in a variety of positions they particularly impressed in an advanced midfield role. They scored their first goal in English football on 15 February 2020, with their 93rd-minute strike securing a 3–2 victory over Northampton Town at the Bescot Stadium.
On 11 August 2020, they re-joined Walsall on a permanent deal for an undisclosed fee. They made a good start to the 2020–21 season, playing on the right-wing and equalling their season-high goals tally of two by mid-October as the "Saddlers" put together a 12-game unbeaten run in the league. However they suffered a knee injury before a game at Salford City in December 2020, and though they made a brief return to action the following April in which they were described as a "a breath of fresh air" by interim head coach Brian Dutton, they would then suffer a further setback and was ruled out for the entirety of the 2021–22 campaign, with head coach Matt Taylor stating that they had to undergo another procedure after seeing "the best knee specialist in the country". They left Walsall upon the expiry of their contract in June 2022.
Port Vale
In June 2022, they began training with League One side Port Vale, who were managed by Darrell Clarke, Holden's former boss at Walsall. The club reportedly offered to pay their medical costs as they continued their recovery from long-term absence. Holden signed for Port Vale on 29 July 2022.
International career
In 2018, Holden won three caps for the Northern Ireland under-21 team in victories against Luxembourg, Spain and Iceland; they scored the only goal of the game against Luxembourg.
Style of play
Holden is a left-footed midfielder with high energy and intelligence levels.

Tombaugh Cliffs () is a group of ice-free cliffs which stand at the north side of the mouth of Pluto Glacier and face towards the George VI Ice Shelf which occupies George VI Sound, on the east side of Alexander Island, Antarctica. Photographed from the air by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947–48; surveyed by Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey from 1948 to 1950. The naming by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee continues the astronomy related or celestial theme displayed in the toponymy of this area. The cliffs were named for Clyde Tombaugh (1906-1997), an American astronomer who studied at Lowell Observatory and who first discovered the dwarf planet Pluto in 1930.

Neocosmospora indica
Neocosmospora parva
Neocosmospora spinulosa
Neocosmospora striata

Bioassay-guided fractionation of a fungus Neocosmospora sp. resulted in the isolation of three new resorcylic acid lactones, neocosmosin A (2), neocosmosin B (3) and neocosmosin C (4). Three known resorcylic acid lactones, monocillin IV (1), monocillin II (5) and radicicol (6) were also isolated and identified, where compounds 4–6 show good binding affinity for the human opioid receptors. These findings have important implications for the potential psychoactive effects with this class of compounds.

is a Japanese rock band from Kyoto. The band was formed in 2010 by vocalist and guitarist Ikumi "Ikkyu" Nakajima, guitarist Motoko "Motifour" Kida and bassist Hiromi "Hirohiro" Sagane. Known for their intricate rhythms and visual identity, they have released six full-length studio albums. Their musical style has been described by Rolling Stone as "adrenalized math rock sped up and given pop's candy coating".
History
Tricot was formed in Kyoto in 2010 by vocalist and guitarist Ikumi "Ikkyu" Nakajima, guitarist Motoko "Motifour" Kida and bassist Hiromi "Hirohiro" Sagane. Sagane is a native of the city, while Nakajima and Kida are from neighboring Shiga Prefecture. Prior to forming Tricot, the three musicians played in various local bands in the Kyoto area, where they became acquainted with one another. Kazutaka Komaki joined the band as drummer in May 2011. Shortly after, Tricot established their own label, Bakuretsu Records. In October 2013, the band released their first full-length studio album T H E, which peaked at number 18 on the Oricon Albums Chart. In March 2014, Komaki left the band due to musical differences. In their absence, the remaining trio opted to tour and record with a rotating cast of musicians. Later that year, Tricot embarked on a tour of five Asian countries, followed by a tour of Europe in which they performed at several music festivals, including the Eden Sessions festival in the United Kingdom, where they supported Pixies.
Tricot's second studio album A N D was released in March 2015 and peaked at number 34 on the Oricon chart. They subsequently staged a tour of North America, Japan and Europe, titled the Yattokosa Tour, from October 2015 to March 2016. The band's third studio album, 3, was issued in May 2017, reaching number 20 on the Oricon chart. It was supported by the Tricot vs 47 tours, which saw the band performing in each of Japan's 47 prefectures, and a European tour. At the end of the final concert of the Tricot vs 47 tours, it was announced that Yusuke Yoshida, who had been touring with Tricot since 2016, had become a full-time member and thus the second official drummer in the band's history. Tricot undertook their second tour of North America in 2018.
In 2018, Nakajima formed the band Genie High along with comedians Kazutoyo Koyabu and Kukki and musicians Enon Kawatani and Takashi Niigaki.
Tricot released their fourth studio album Black in January 2020, and it reached number 27 on the Oricon chart. Black was the band's first album to be released by 8902, their newly established label under Cutting Edge.
To mark the tenth anniversary of their formation, Tricot released a new studio album in October 2020 entitled 10, which peaked at number 48 on the Oricon chart.
Jodeki, their sixth studio album, was released on December 15, 2021, peaking at number 50 on the Oricon chart. It is the band's first double album, with 24 songs – 12 being instrumentals. Supporting the album, the band toured Japan and Europe in the Walking x Walking Tour.
On 2 September 2022, the band announced via social media that their seventh studio album, Fudeki, will be released on 14 December 2022. It is preceded by lead single "End Roll", released in February 2022 as the opening theme for Japanese TV series Liar. Like Jodeki, the double album will include instrumentals of each song on the second disc.

The 2020 General Tire 200 was the third stock car race of the 2020 ARCA Menards Series and the 59th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, June 20, in Lincoln, Alabama at Talladega Superspeedway, a 2.66 miles (4.28 km) permanent triangle-shaped superspeedway. The race took the scheduled 76 laps to complete. At race's end, Drew Dollar of Venturini Motorsports would take advantage of a spinning Michael Self with two to go to take their first ever ARCA Menards Series career win and their first of the season. To fill out the podium, Ryan Repko of Venturini Motorsports and Bret Holmes of Bret Holmes Racing would finish second and third, respectively.
The race was the return of the ARCA Menards Series, after a 107-day delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Background
Talladega Superspeedway, originally known as Alabama International Motor Superspeedway (AIMS), is a motorsports complex located north of Talladega, Alabama. It is located on the former Anniston Air Force Base in the small city of Lincoln. The track is a tri-oval and was constructed in the 1960s by the International Speedway Corporation, a business controlled by the France family. Talladega is most known for its steep banking and the unique location of the start/finish line that's located just past the exit to pit road. The track currently hosts the NASCAR series such as the NASCAR Cup Series, Xfinity Series and the Camping World Truck Series. Talladega is the longest NASCAR oval with a length of 2.66-mile-long (4.28 km) tri-oval like the Daytona International Speedway, which also is a 2.5-mile-long (4 km) tri-oval.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a novelization by Alexander Freed of the 2016 film of the same name.
Development
Freed had previously written for story lines for Star Wars: The Old Republic and the novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, often focusing on the stories of "ordinary" characters. They were given access to the film script, which they divided into chapters with distinct point-of-view characters rather than using an omniscient narrator. Freed also incorporated sections of "Supplemental Data" to add a "documentary feel" comparable to the camerawork of director Gareth Edwards.
Differences from the film
In the beginning, when Galen boards the shuttle with Director Krennic, they feel a sense of remorse for what they did.
Jyn Erso's history is slightly expanded upon in the book.
More background details are revealed on Jyn's cellmate during their time in imperial captivity.
The book also expands on the rivalry between Orson Krennic and Grand Moff Tarkin.
More of the Death Star attack on Jedha city is revealed, including Imperial casualties.
More is written from the perspective of Admiral Raddus, including a brief history of their species.
The finale also gives more from the perspectives of each main character. The finale also offers a slight difference from the film. Instead of a male rebel, a middle aged rebel woman with a burned face hands over the data of the Death Star to Captain Antilles, who in turn hands them over to Princess Leia, leading directly to the events of A New Hope.
Publication history
As was the case with the previous novelization, to avoid spoilers the hardcover book was released after the film while the ebook was available on the day of the film's US release. The novel held a 4.16/5 rating on meta-critic site Goodreads, as of June, 2022.

The Naval Research Laboratory Flyrt, or Flying Radar Target, was a small electric-powered unmanned aerial vehicle developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory to serve as an expendable radar decoy for the defense of United States Navy ships. Tested in the fall of 1993, it was considered successful but was not ordered into production.
Design and development
Begun in 1991, the Flyrt program was intended to produce an expendable decoy drone, not requiring any new aboardship infrastructure, for the defense of warships against radar-guided antiship missiles. It produced a drone that was of conventional configuration, having a low-mounted, folding wing and a cruciform tail section; an electric motor was mounted in the nose of the aircraft. Launch was via a rocket booster, providing 1.6 seconds of thrust, from the Mark 137 launcher of the Mark 36 SRBOC system; the use of the Mark 36 launcher put a constraint on the possible size of the drone, which was designed to compact into a package the size of a standard NATO Mark 36 chaff rocket. The tail fins would unfold immediately on launch, while the wing would deploy and motor start after burnout as the aircraft coasted to the apogee of a ballistic trajectory. The expendable Flyrt carried a radio repeater with two antennae for spoofing enemy radar signals.
Operational history
Following a series of ballistic tests to verify compatibility of the launcher, the Flyrt trial program moved to full-scale tests of the vehicle, with the drone's first flight coming on 9 September 1993. Thirteen drones were constructed for the program, conducted at the NRL's Chesapeake Bay Detachment, which was considered successful; however, no production was undertaken.

The Chamber of Commerce in Douala, Cameroon is a building constructed between 1927 and 1928 under the French mandate, under the umbrella of the League of Nations. This building is in a late Art Nouveau architectural style.
History
The Chamber of Commerce was built between 1927 and 1928, and meant to host the Chamber of Commerce. It is among the earliest architectural testimonies of the early French era, within the framework of the Mandate, under the umbrella of the League of Nations, after Germany was defeated in September 1918.
Created in 1921, before the Conference and the treaty of Versailles, the Chamber of Commerce is merely an advisory body. Its mission was to give account of the resources dedicated to development, and also to fix the market prices lists for the farmers. The fifteen members of the Chamber were chosen by the Commissioner of the Republic, and appointed for two years through an arrêté. Among them were two natives: a farmer and a trader, a kind of social innovation within this very context of racial segregation.
At the entrance of the edifice, there is a plate that commemorates General Charles de Gaulle's visit to Cameroon in 1940. They delivered an appeal to the inhabitants to join Free France in front of the building.

Odontopleurida is an order of very spinose trilobites closely related to the trilobites of the order Lichida. Some experts group the Odontopleurid families, Odontopleuridae and Damesellidae, within Lichida. Odontopleurids tend to have convex, bar-shaped cephalons, and lobed, knob-shaped glabella that extend to, or almost to the anterior margin. Many, if not almost all odontopleurids have long spines that are derived either from the margins of the exoskeleton, or from granular or tubercular ornamentation, or both. Many odontopleurids are so spinose so as to be described as having "spines on (their) spines." Odontopleurids have 8 to 13 thoracic segments, with Odontopleuridae odontopleurids having no more than 10, and Damesellidae odontopleurids having no more than 13. The pygidium tends to be very small, and invariably has long spines emanating from it in all known genera.
Genera of Damesellidae are restricted to Middle to Upper Cambrian marine strata, and may represent a transition between Cambrian-aged lichids, and odontopleurids of Odontopleuridae. The odontopleurids of Odontopleuridae first appear in the Upper Cambrian, and go extinct before the end of the Frasnian stage of the late Devonian.

Sir James Fortescue Flannery, 1st Baronet (16 December 1851 – 5 October 1943) was an English engineer and naval architect, and Liberal Unionist (later Conservative Party) politician.
Flannery was born in Liverpool, the son of Capt. John Flannery of Seacombe. Educated at the Liverpool College of Science and Victoria University, they worked in Birkenhead and was subsequently engaged by Sir Edward J Reid KCS later Chief Constructor of H.M Navy. They were head of Flannery, Baggally & Johnson Marine Engineering, which eventually opened offices in London, Liverpool and Rotterdam. and a Director of London and South Western Bank. Between 1900 and 1906 they were President of the Railway Clerks' Association. They were President of the Institute of Marine Engineers 1914, and later President of the Society of Consulting Engineers 1931.
They were appointed J.P for Surrey 1892, for Kent in 1895, knighted in 1899, and appointed JP for Essex in 1904.
They were elected at the 1895 general election as Member of Parliament for Shipley in West Yorkshire, holding the seat until the 1906 general election. They returned to Parliament at the January 1910 election as Conservative Party MP for Maldon in Essex.
In the latter constituency they fought the 1918 election as a Coalition Conservative candidate, winning with a majority of 1823, but passing the baton over to Edward Ruggles-Brise for the 1922 election.
Created a baronet in 1904, of Wethersfield Manor, Essex, they were also Lord of the Manor of Wethersfield. In 1882 they married Edith Mary Emma, daughter of Osborn Jenkyn of Ealing who predeceased them by eight years.
Flannery died in October 1943 aged 91 leaving an estate valued at over £400,000, £150,000 being paid in tax. Their son Sir Harold (born 1883) was given a life interest in the estate and provision was made through a trust fund for daughters Kathleen Edith (Hartridge) and Enid Fortescue (Lindsay). The family sold the Wethersfield property in 1957.
The terms of Flannery's will display a remarkable concern about premature burial with clear instructions as to how their body should be treated prior to interment.

Grand Trunk Western No. 4070 is a class "S-3-a" 2-8-2 type USRA Light Mikado steam locomotive originally built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in December 1918 for the Grand Trunk as No. 474, later re-numbered by Grand Trunk Western Railroad, after the GT was absorbed into Canadian National as GTW No. 3734. In the late 1950s the locomotive was given a larger tender, from an S-3-c, and re-numbered 4070. The locomotive has pulled passenger excursions in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania over the years.
History
Revenue service
Grand Trunk Western 4070 was built in December 1918 by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in Schenectady, New York and assigned to Grand Trunk, which numbered it originally as 474. Sometime in the 1930s a Coffin feedwater heater was installed, and with other improvements, the number was changed by the GTW to 3734. This steam locomotive's road career consisted of pulling freight and passenger services in Michigan. After falling into a turntable in June 1955, the locomotive was shopped and given a larger tender, and the locomotive's number was changed to 4070. The 4070 continued to pull regular duty until March 29, 1960, when it pulled its final revenue freight, from Pontiac to Durand, MI and then was retired. In 1961, Lou Keller, a member of the National Railway Historical Society's Iowa chapter purchased 4070. In 1966 the Midwest Railway Historical Foundation (now MRPS) acquired the locomotive on a five-year lease and was moved into storage under the Cleveland Union Terminal. It was then moved to Chicago in 1967, where it was restored to operating condition by Richard Jensen and their crew, who also worked on fellow GTW USRA locomotive No. 5629.
Life after the Grand Trunk
4070 operated for the first time again on November 3, 1968, by pulling a passenger excursion from Dearborn Station, Chicago to South Bend, Ind. commemorating the 50th anniversary of their build date in 1918. An additional excursion was also made from these two points on March 23, 1969. On August 31, 1969, 4070 pulled a passenger fan trip from Erie to Greenville, Pennsylvania on the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad. The 4070 was also used at Conneaut Lake Park in PA. In 1971, MRHF bought out the lease. In 1975 it was selected to be used on the newly created Cuyahoga Valley Line - now known as the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad. In 1977, the 4070 performed a doubleheader along the famed Horseshoe Curve with Reading T-1 4-8-4 "Northern" 2102. However, that trip was plagued with mechanical issues; while on the curve, the 4070 threw an eccentric rod, and the busy Conrail line where their train sat had to be shut down for several hours. After the incident, Conrail banned steam operations for the next several years. The 4070 had its rods repaired and was brought back to pull passenger trains on the Cuyahoga Valley Line. Additionally, in 1983, the locomotive was painted as Chicago, Burlington and Quincy 4070, and run to South Dayton, NY, for filming in the movie The Natural, starring Robert Redford, and released in 1984. After the movie, it continued service on the CVL until encountering mechanical difficulties in 1990. Upon inspection, 4070 was found to be in need of repairs. Seeing that the cost of the repairs would be prohibitive, 4070 was once again retired from service.
Second restoration
In 2011 the process started of restoring the locomotive to operational condition at the Midwest Railway Preservation Society in Cleveland, Ohio. The locomotive boiler and tender have both been tested using ultrasound. The locomotive must have its drypipe, and front and rear tube sheets replaced. In addition, the smokebox, firebox, frame, running gear, driving boxes, tender and many assorted parts all need major work before 4070 can be operational. The estimated cost of 4070's restoration is $1,290,000. As of 2022, the MRPS has re-organized their portion of the roundhouse for more suitable space to work on No. 4070, and they have seamed the crack the locomotive's frame has had from its 1955 incident. It will likely be a few more years before the locomotive would be ready to steam up again.
In popular culture
The engine made a special "guest appearance" in the 1984 movie The Natural, starring Robert Redford. The movie portion was filmed on the NY&LE railroad, in South Dayton, New York.

The Battle of Cook's Mills was the last engagement between U.S. and British armies in the Niagara, and the penultimate engagement (followed by the Battle of Malcolm's Mills) on Canadian soil during the War of 1812. After about a half-hour, American forces out-maneuvered the British column and destroyed all grain and flour.
Background
General Gordon Drummond had lifted the Siege of Fort Erie on 21 September 1814, and withdrew to a strong defensive position at Fort Chippawa on the north bank of Chippawa Creek. An American division under Major General George Izard had marched overland from Plattsburgh, New York to reinforce the Americans at Fort Erie (commanded by Major General Jacob Brown). Being the senior Major General, Izard took command of the combined force. The more aggressive Brown wished to attack Drummond immediately, with the combined force numbering 6,300. Izard chose not to risk the casualties of attacking a strong defensive position. Angered at Izard's lack of action, Brown left with their division (half the army's strength) and marched to Sacketts Harbor, New York, where a British attack was feared.
Izard finally marched north to Chippawa Creek. The creek was unfordable, and the bridge had been destroyed. During 16 October, their artillery exchanged fire with the British, without effect.
Battle
Attempting to deprive the British of their chief source of flour, Izard sent a brigade of about 1,200 men, consisting of the 5th, 14th, 15th and 16th U.S. Infantry with some detachments of riflemen and U.S. Dragoons under Brigadier General Daniel Bissell, to take Cooks Mills on Lyon's Creek in Crowland township. In response, Drummond dispatched about 750 men (the 6th Regiment, the Glengarry Light Infantry and the flank companies of the 104th Regiment, with a 6-pounder gun and a Congreve rocket detachment) under Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Myers to reconnoitre the American force.
On the morning of 19 October, Myers came into contact with the American picket just east of the mills. A half-hour fight ensued, but the Americans could not be lured from the cover of the woods. Observing American soldiers moving through the trees on their right and left, Myers feared their force was being out-manoeuvred. They ordered a retreat, and the Americans promptly pursued their column nearly to their camp at the Lyon's Creek settlement. Returning to Cook Mills, the Americans destroyed all the grain and flour found in the mill, and the next day they withdrew to their camp at Black Creek.
Aftermath
The battle showed the effects of Izard's well trained troops. Despite this minor victory, it became apparent that Drummond was not going to move from their defences. Izard also heard that British ships dominated Lake Ontario, and any American advance risked being cut off by a landing in its rear. They withdrew to Fort Erie. The British loss of 200 bushels of wheat was offset when several American provision boats crossed the Niagara unaware of Izard's retreat and fell into British hands.
Izard later destroyed Fort Erie and returned to the U.S. side of the river. Drummond moved to the remains of the fort but chose not to rebuild it, and the fighting along the Niagara Frontier came to an end.
The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site in 1921, and is a unit of the national park system. A federal cairn were erected in 1923, and the current plaque replaced the original on the cairn in 1977. Bicentennial commemorations in 2014 included construction of a visitors' plaza and the unveiling of interpretive markers.
Eight active regular battalions of the United States Army (1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf and 3-4 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of a number of American infantry regiments (the old 5th, 14th and 16th Infantry Regiments) that took part in the battle.

Diplomatic relations exist between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Colombia. Both nations are members of the OECD and the United Nations.
History
Initial relations between Colombia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire took place in 1870 when the empire opened an honorary consulate in Barranquilla and in Bogotá. After World War I in 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated and Austria became an independent nation.
In 1920, Austria and Colombia established diplomatic relations. Soon afterwards, both nations opened resident diplomatic missions in their respective capitals. In 2012, Austria closed its embassy in Bogotá, however, the embassy was reopened in 2016.
In March 2016, Austrian President Heinz Fischer paid an official visit to Colombia, becoming the first Austrian head-of-state to visit the South American nation. In January 2018, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos paid an official visit to Austria, becoming the first Colombian President to visit the nation.

Bilateral agreements
Both nations have signed a few bilateral agreements such as Agreement for the Abolition of Visas for holders of Diplomatic, Official or Service Passports (1958); Memorandum of Understanding on High-Level Political Consultations between both countries Ministry's of Foreign Affairs (1999); Memorandum of Understanding of Cooperation in Economic, Scientific and Technological Matters (2012); and a Memorandum of Understanding for closer Cooperation in the Judicial Field (2015).
Cultural ties
The famous botanist and physician Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin (1727–1817) conducted research trips to the region between 1755 and 1759, which took them to the Atlantic coast of Colombia. Karl Brunner (1887–1960) is considered the founding father of modern urban planning in Bogotá, where they served in the 1930s. Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (1912–1994) was one of the founding fathers of cultural anthropology and ethnology in Colombia. The architect Fritz Blodek (1905–2001) designed more than 150 buildings for housing and industrial use, especially in Medellín. The bookseller and journalist Hans Ungar (1916–2004) created a Central Library with the axis of the intellectual and cultural life of Bogotá.

Kensington Hospital, formerly known as Kensington Hospital for Women, is the 2nd oldest, and last remaining independent hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The hospital was established in 1887 by Howard A. Kelly, MD, who later became one of the founding professors at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the chair of gynecological surgery of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The hospital was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 2019.
History
In the mid 1880s, Dr. Howard A. Kelly opened a gynecological clinic on Diamond Street in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia with the goal of providing access to healthcare for working-class women. They purchased a mansion on Kensington's Norris Square in 1890 with the help local philanthropists and converted the building into a women's hospital. The hospital eventually expanded to inhabit structures from 128 to 140 Diamond Street. Kensington Hospital for Women was sixth women's hospital in the United States.
The hospital experienced financial difficulties as a result of The Great Depression and later lost a number of doctors and nurses when their services were needed elsewhere during World War II. The hospital closed in February 1945, but was purchased and reopened in 1946 as a general, nonprofit hospital by four doctors including Drs. Benjamin Ulanski and Leopold Vaccaro. The doctors began offering additional services and renamed the facility Kensington Hospital as it was no longer exclusively for women. Around this time, it is noted that the hospital began receiving financial support from a number of local Jewish philanthropists, some of whom sat on the hospital's board and owned nearby factories.
By the 1960s, the hospital could not compete with larger medical centers who had access to the most up-to-date technologies and nearly merged with other hospitals on a number of occasions. As the neighborhood's African American and Latino populations grew, the hospital employed a bi-lingual staff to better serve the community.
The hospital continued to struggle financially through the mid-1980s and was forced to pay a $400,000 fine when it was discovered that two hospital administrators had defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. It remained open and began specializing in treating those suffering from addiction.
Present Day
The Kensington neighborhood was hard-hit by the opioid crisis and has been referred to as the "largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast". Enforcement programs and gentrification in adjacent neighborhoods like Fishtown has caused some drug-related activity to move north. Kensington Hospital continues to serve the neighborhood and specializes in treating infections related to drug and alcohol abuse.
It remains the only independent hospital in Philadelphia.

Frederik Christian Vilhelm Christesen (4 July 1822 – 29 December 1899) was a Danish goldsmith and silversmith. Their firm was from 1858 based at Amaliegade 11 in Copenhagen.
Early life and education
Christesen was born on 4 July 1822 in Copenhagen, the son of helmsman Anders (or Hans) Christensen (1792-1828) and Vilhelmine Magdalene Augusta Grandjean (1796-1849). The mother moved the family to Slagelse following the father's death in 1825. Christesen was apprenticed to Jacob Kjølstrup in their new home town. On completing their apprenticeship in 1843, they travelled to Bremen as a journeyman to work for Wilkens & Salme.
Career
In 1846, they returned to Slagelse and took over their old master's workshop. In 1856, they moved to Copenhagen where they were initially based at Løvstræde 122 (old number). In 1857, they obtained a license to start a silver and gold pressing factory. It was the first enterprise of its kind in the country and soon grew to considerable size. In 1858, they moved their enterprise to a building in the courtyard of Amaliegade 11. Their products were initially sold through other gold smiths but in 1865 they opened their own shop. Their business was mainly based on industrial mass production but their involvement in Kunstflidslotteriet (founded 1861) and the associated artists resulted in a number of precious show pieces for which they received recognition on a number of exhibitions in Denmark and abroad.
Personal life
Christesen was on 28 June 1846 in Bremen married to Luise Sophie Dorothea Pape (25 August 1825 - 10 August 1882). They were a daughter of mail carrier and former distiller Hermann Pape (1790-1838) and Dorothea Margarethe Plöger (1799-1865).
In 1874, Christesen purchased Amaliegade 11. They heightened the building facing the street to four storeys and constructed a short perpendicular side wing on its rear. They lived with their family in the apartment on the first floor. They died on 29 December 1899 and is buried in the Cemetery of Holmen.
Legacy
Christesen's factory was internationally renowned for its 'Ancient Norse' style jewellery, copying archeological objects from the Bronze Age to the medieval period. The company's work was popular in England where it was copied by læcal goldsmiths.

Taini Maremare Jamison (née Royal; born 1928) is a former New Zealand netball coach and administrator. They coached the New Zealand national team to its first world title at the 1967 World Netball Championships. The Taini Jamison Trophy, contested between New Zealand and visiting international teams other than Australia, is named in their honour.
Early life and family
Jamison was born Taini Maremare Royal in Rotorua in 1928. Them father, Te Rangiātaahua Kiniwē Royal, was of Ngāti Raukawa and Ngāti Tamaterā descent, and their mother, Irihapeti Te Puhi-o-Rākaiora Taiaroa, was from Ngāi Tahu. Them father worked for the Māori Land Court and was often away from home carrying out surveys. The family briefly moved to Ruatoki in the eastern Bay of Plenty because of their job. They served with the Māori Battalion in World War II, was badly wounded and was awarded the Military Cross. Jamison studied at Rotorua High and Grammar School, but when their father was posted to Wellington after the war they moved to Wellington Girls' College, later studying at Wellington Teachers' Training College. In Wellington, they joined the Ngāti Pōneke Young Māori Club, which was much in demand to perform at government functions. They recall performing for the famous British singer Gracie Fields, when Fields was touring the South Pacific in 1945.
After qualifying as a teacher, they had several different postings. When based in Horohoro, near Rotorua, they met their husband, Tom Jamison, who was coaching the local basketball team. Three months after they married, they died after an accident on the basketball court. They were already pregnant and their son was named after their husband. They did not remarry. Jamison spent eight years teaching in Horohoro before moving to Malfroy Primary School in Rotorua, where they stayed until reaching retirement age.
Netball career
Jamison's interest in netball began at a young age. They progressed to being a member of the Rotorua representative team, which won the national championships, and they were selected for the North Island team on three occasions. They retired from competition in 1959, after which they spent a decade coaching the Rotorua team. They also competed in tennis tournaments.
In 1967, Jamison coached the New Zealand netball team that won the World Netball Championships in Perth, Australia. Four years later, they coached the New Zealand team to the runners-up position in the 1971 World Netball Championships in Jamaica, when the team was away from home for almost four months. They were the first Māori coach of the New Zealand netball team, and is its most successful coach, having a percentage win rate of 90 per cent. Jamison has been involved for nearly all of their adult life with Netball Rotorua and was its president from 1981 to 2001.
Awards and honours
In 1972, Jamison was awarded the Netball New Zealand Service Award. In the 1994 New Year Honours, they were appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to netball. Jamison was inducted into the Māori Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, and in 2010, they were made a life member of Netball New Zealand.
In 2008, the Taini Jamison Trophy was established. It is contested when any netballing nation or nations, other than Australia, play the Silver Ferns in New Zealand.

The Suzuki–Kasami algorithm is a token-based algorithm for achieving mutual exclusion in distributed systems. The process holding the token is the only process able to enter its critical section.
This is a modification to Ricart–Agrawala algorithm in which a REQUEST and REPLY message are used for attaining the critical section, but in this algorithm, a method was introduced in which a seniority vise and also by handing over the critical section to other node by sending a single PRIVILEGE message to other node. So, the node which has the privilege it can use the critical section and if it does not have one it cannot. If a process wants to enter its critical section and it does not have the token, it broadcasts a request message to all other processes in the system. The process that has the token, if it is not currently in a critical section, will then send the token to the requesting process. The algorithm makes use of increasing Request Numbers to allow messages to arrive out-of-order.
Algorithm description
Let be the number of processes. Each process is identified by an integer in .
Data structures
Each process maintains one data structure:
an array (for Request Number), being the ID of the process containing this array, where stores the last Request Number received by from
The token contains two data structures:
an array (for Last request Number), where stores the most recent Request Number of process for which the token was successfully granted
a queue , storing the ID of processes waiting for the token
Algorithm
Requesting the critical section (CS)
When process wants to enter the CS, if it does not have the token, it:
increments its sequence number
sends a request message containing new sequence number to all processes in the system
Releasing the CS
When process leaves the CS, it:
sets of the token equal to . This indicates that its request has been executed
for every process not in the token queue , it appends to if . This indicates that process has an outstanding request
if the token queue is not empty after this update, it pops a process ID from and sends the token to
otherwise, it keeps the token
Receiving a request
When process receives a request from with sequence number , it:
sets to (if , the message is outdated)
if process has the token and is not in CS, and if (indicating an outstanding request), it sends the token to process
Executing the CS
A process enters the CS when it has acquired the token.
Performance
Either or messages for CS invocation (no messages if process holds the token; otherwise requests and reply)
Synchronization delay is or ( requests and reply)
Notes on the algorithm
Only the site currently holding the token can access the CS
All processes involved in the assignment of the CS
Request messages sent to all nodes
Not based on Lamport's logical clock
The algorithm uses sequence numbers instead
Used to keep track of outdated requests
They advance independently on each site
The main design issues of the algorithm:
Telling outdated requests from current ones
Determining which site is going to get the token next

Jualin Mine is a defunct gold mine located within the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska approximately northwest of downtown Juneau, Alaska. The Jualin gold deposit was discovered by prospector Frank Cook in 1895 and was initially mined by the Jualin Mining Company. A stamping mill with a daily capacity of of ore was installed early in the mine's operation. The mine operated intermittently from 1896 to 1901 and again from 1905 to 1908, when it was closed at a depth of 210 feet due to water infiltration and power shortages. In 1912, the mine was purchased by a Belgian group, which began investing in better equipment and deeper drilling. In 1914, the shaft was deepened to 325 feet, and mining took place at the 310-foot level. A drainage and haulage tunnel was planned to extend south of the mine to allow easy access to the mining levels, but the outbreak of World War I halted this effort when the extension was only long.
Following the end of the war, the mine was purchased by a new company named the Southeastern Alaska Mining Corporation, which aimed to put the mine back into service. This effort failed, however, and the mine remained unused until the late 20th century, when Coeur Alaska, a subsidiary of Coeur Mining, purchased mining rights to the Jualin and nearby Kensington mines. Today, Coeur Alaska leases the Jualin from Hyak Mining Company, which owns the property. The Jualin site is home to administration and support buildings for the Kensington mine, but Coeur Alaska is exploring the Jualin site for mining potential. From 1896 to 1919, of gold were extracted from the mine, making it the fourth most-productive mine in the Juneau Mining District (behind Alaska-Juneau (AJ), Perseverance and Treadwell) before the modern era.

Cameraria pentekes is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from British Columbia in Canada, and California and Washington in the United States.
The length of the forewings is 3–5 mm.
The larvae feed on Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is oblong to ovoid. The epidermis is opaque to green yellow. Mines are all located to one side of the midrib on the lower half of the leaf. They are found along the leaf margin or the midrib and solitary with some leaves supporting more than one mine, usually with many minute parallel folds, occasionally
with one or two, more or less pronounced.
Etymology
The specific name refers to the diagnostic form of the vincular process of the male and is derived from the Greek pente (meaning five) and the suffix -ekes (meaning pointed).

On 26 May 1822, during the Pentecost service, the church at Grue, Norway, caught fire and at least 113 people were killed. It is the deadliest fire disaster in the history of Norway.
Church
The old Grue Church was located close to Skulstad, north-west of Kirkenær in Solør. It was close to the bank of the River Glomma, and because of the likelihood that it would be undercut by erosion, a decision had been taken in 1794 to rebuild it further from the river, but this had not yet been done. An old woman had prophesied that the church would be destroyed on a Pentecost, either by water or by fire.
The church was made entirely of wood. The oldest section was believed to date to the 13th century and was built using the stave method. It had been rebuilt around 1600 with the addition of two transepts built with round, hand-worked logs and a tall central tower. Above the nave and the two transepts were wide galleries, allowing the church to accommodate up to 700 people. Both nave and transepts had entrance doors which swung inwards. The windows were placed high up on the wall. The exterior of the building was covered with waterproofing pine tar; subsequent calculations estimated that 17 tons of tar had been applied over the two hundred years before the fire.
Fire
On 26 May 1822, a bright, hot day in early summer, 500–600 people were in the church for the Pentecost service, including mothers with babies to be baptised. As the vicar, Iver Hesselberg, was coming to the end of their sermon on weather and fire as images of the Holy Spirit, there was a loud noise as fire broke through the wooden wall. The church was completely destroyed in the ensuing blaze.
The three doors all opened inward, and the main, south door was soon blocked by fire. Panic broke out as the pressure of those trying to escape hindered keeping the doors open, and the north door itself blocked the exit for people descending from the north gallery. Some fell in front of the doors and others climbed over them. People jumped from the galleries onto those below, and some bodies were found crowded together in standing position. At least 113 people were killed; a total of 116 is also mentioned. The dead included 69 women and 36 children under the age of 15, but only eight or ten men. Unmarried young people and women traditionally sat separated from the men, who were closer to the south door and were able to escape through it before it became blocked, while other men, including the vicar, managed to save themselves by climbing out of the windows, although badly burnt by the melting stained glass. Many bodies were unidentifiable; Vogt Dines Guldberg Høegh, who had tried in vain to save lives by calming the crowd, was recognised by their sabre. The sabre is today on display in the sacristy of the new church.
On 1 June the victims were buried in five coffins (Høegh in a separate coffin) in a common grave dug where the altar of the destroyed church had been.
The cause of the fire was never discovered. One theory is that a spark from a fire vessel in which the church servant brought embers to light the altar candles could have set fire to the wall. Another theory was that someone had experimented with a burning-glass outside the church.
Legacy
The new church, which is located in the center of Kirkenær, was completed in 1828. A standing stone was erected in front of it in 1922 in remembrance of the victims. In the spring of 2005 a historical marker with photos and a map was erected at Skulstad to the south of the location of the old church, which was covered by the river 40 years after the fire.
One consequence of the Grue Church fire was a law which was passed the following year prescribing that all doors of public buildings must swing outwards.
Peter Wessel Zapffe's novel Lyksalig pinsefest fire samtaler med Jørgen (Blissful Pentecost: Four Dialogues with Jørgen) is based on the disaster, treating it as an instance of the problem of evil.

Toldos Yeshurun Yeshiva is an educational institution for Russian-speaking baalei teshuva in Jerusalem. The yeshiva is located inside the Mir yeshiva, and avreichim from the Mir teach the yeshiva's students on a regular basis.
The yeshiva is one of the projects of the Toldos Yeshurun organization. Its goal is to bridge the gap of knowledge and skills in Torah learning between newly observant Russian-speaking young men and their peers who were brought up in the yeshiva system. After a year or two at this yeshiva, graduates go on to study in the best Israeli yeshivos, or marry and continue their studies in a kollel.
The yeshiva, as the organization of Toldos Yeshurun, was founded by Rabbi Yitzchok Zilber. Their son, Rabbi Ben Zion Zilber, continues to lead the organization after Rabbi Yitzchok's passing.
Studies take place from 9:15 in the morning until lunch at 1:15 pm and continue from 3:30 pm until 7 pm and from 8:30 pm until 10:30 pm.
Forms of learning in the yeshiva are the shiur (lecture) and chavruta (learning partner). Part of the classes are held in Russian, and other classes, for the more advanced, are held in Hebrew.
A kollel for young married Russian-speaking men operates within the framework of the yeshiva.

Sophie Bongers (born ), better known by their stage name Sophie Francis, is a Dutch record producer, DJ and musician.
Biography
Early life
Sophie was born on 2 December 1998 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands but they used to live in St Francis Bay, South Africa, for a big part of their childhood. They moved to Sint-Oedenrode, Netherlands later with their parents. From an early age, they had an interest in music. By the age of 9, they started playing piano and singing along to many songs. At the age of 14, they had to do a school project at the International School of Eindhoven (ISE) where they should develop a new skill during 9 months, and being so much into the music, they got inspired to do something with it for this project. Besides that, they also wanted to do something with people. When doing research they found a video of a DJ playing a live set who had a great connection with the crowd. As they loved the vibe and was amazed by how one person can transfer their energy to an entire crowd with music, they realized that "when you are a DJ, you have this special connection with people, I think that's amazing!". They went to a music school in Eindhoven, where they began taking DJ lessons and met new friends who already began producing music, kicking off their career two years before their graduation, achieved on 19 May 2017.
Music career
Them first residency was at a small bar Het Pumpke in their hometown of Sint-Oedenrode, when they were only 15 years old. Since then, they were regularly invited to perform at various events in the Netherlands. They began their career under the stage name "Sophie's Choice". In the summer of 2015, they signed with Always Management. They also performed at BCM in Mallorca. In October, due to a trademark conflict, they changed their stage name to "Sophie Francis" as a tribute to St Francis Bay, a town in South Africa where they grew up. In late November, they were invited to South Africa for a tour, where they performed main-stage at The Ruins Festival in St Francis Bay and The Coco Club in Cape Town, as well as an appearance on national television. One day, they noticed that John Christian was announcing a new record label that supports new talents. Afterwards, they caught the attention of Christian by sending some demos, and the two began working together to release Sophie's music on Christian's record label Freeway Recordings.
2016
On 29 February 2016 they released "Drop of a Dime", their first single on Freeway Recordings, followed by their second single "Up in This", which was described by EDMTunes as "a mainstage-ready banger" that "proves why the likes of Ummet Ozcan and Quintino have already thrown them support".
Them third single titled "Bad Boy" was released on 20 June, and later on they released the track "Annihilate" as a free download, which received over 2 million plays on SoundCloud.
During summer they also performed main-stage at festivals across the Netherlands and Spain, such as Paellas Universitarias for 35,000 people in Valencia, as well as a concert residency at BCM Mallorca as 'New Discovery' special guest, playing once a week for two months before main guests like Steve Aoki, Nervo, Vinai and Martin Garrix with whom they performed as well a back-to-back.
On 23 September they released their first vocal track "Walls" on Powerhouse Music. The track entered the playlists of Dutch national radio stations such as Radio 538, SLAM! and NPO 3FM, reached the Top 30 on the Dutch Airplay chart, as well as became a Dance Smash on 538 and received 94% of likes from 538 listeners on the item 'Maak 't of kraak 't' (Make it or break it).

Georg Moller (21 January 1784 – 13 March 1852) was an architect and a town planner who worked in the South of Germany, mostly in the region today known as Hessen.
Life and family background
Moller was born in Diepholz, a descendant of an old Norwegian family of clergy, who were known in the 17th century for publishing protestant songbooks. Their father, Levin Adolf Moller, grew up in Westphalia and became a notary in Celle, and from 1777 worked as an advocate and attorney-at-law in Diepholz. Moller's mother, Elisabeth von Castelmur, originated in an old Swiss family of nobility from the Upper Engadin district of Switzerland. Therefore, Moller grew up in a well-situated family.
In 1800, after finishing secondary school Moller began studying architecture with Christian Ludwig Witte in Hannover. Here they were introduced to Friedrich Weinbrenner whom they followed to Karlsruhe in 1802, to continue studies at a school for building trades. During the years 1807–1809 Moller took a study trip to Rome where they gained crucial insight from members of the Roman colony of German artists. After finishing this journey they became a construction superintendent in 1810 and was hired as court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.
Among their major works in this capacity are St. Ludwig, the first Roman Catholic church building in Darmstadt since the Reformation — a building whose forms were inspired by the Pantheon in Rome – the former Landestheater, the Luisenplatz and the Masonic Lodge, what today is the "Moller-Haus". Furthermore, they designed the Staatstheater Mainz, which created a stir because of its semicircular facade, and the Stadtschloss Wiesbaden of the Dukes of Nassau, today the seat of the Landtag of Hesse. From 1843 to 1847 Moller was commissioned by Grand-Duke Ludwig II. to overview the restoration of Schloss Biedenkopf.
Only two of Georg Moller's major works survived the second world war without damages: the grand-ducal mausoleum at the Rosenhöhe and the Ludwigsäule on the Luisenplatz, both of them in Darmstadt. The other buildings Moller designed were damaged beyond repair or were reconstructed in a more simple design.
Moller was also responsible for the reconstruction of the castles in Bad Homburg and Meisenheim, the latter called Wolfgangsbau, for the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. They also worked for prince Klemens von Metternich, redesigning their castle Schloss Johannisberg. They worked in Hannover as well.
Moller is considered, along with Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Leo von Klenze, to be one of the most important German architects working in the Greek Revival and Romanticist styles. Their ingenuity as an engineer and when working space is most evident in the Ludwigskirche in Darmstadt.
Aside their work as an architect Moller was successful as a preserver of buildings. They were at least partly responsible for preserving the Carolingian Torhalle in Lorsch, which today is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Moller in 1818 convinced the Grand-Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt to edict the first ordinance of preservation of ancient buildings, the first law concerning the protection of historic buildings in Germany.
Moller was also well-known for their writings on architecture. Their book Denkmähler der Deutschen Baukunst ("Milestones in German architecture"; 1815–1851) covered buildings from Lorsch (founded 764) to Oppenheim (14th century). The work is notable both for its scholarship and for the quality of its illustrations. They were one of the first to take a stylistic approach to dating of buildings rather than accepting all recorded dates. An English translation of the text was published in 1836. They also wrote Beiträge zu der Lehre von den Konstruktionen ("Contributions to knowledge on construction"; 1833–1844).
Moller also played an important role for the completion of Cologne Cathedral. It was they who discovered one half of the original facade drawing by cathedral masterbuilder Arnold in an attic near Darmstadt, while the other half was found by Sulpiz Boisserée in Paris in 1816. The uncompleted cathedral was completed in accordance with these designs.
Moller died in Darmstadt, aged 68.

The PD Draw is a partially dismantled railroad bridge on the Passaic River between Newark and Kearny in the US state of New Jersey. It was built as part of Central Railroad of New Jersey branch known as the Newark and New York Railroad. The swing bridge is the first crossing upstream from Newark Bay at mile point 1.2.
History
At the north end of the bay at Kearny Point, the mouths of both the Passaic and the Hackensack River meet at the tip of a peninsula once known as New Barbadoes Neck. In order to build the line, the CNJ built bridges across the rivers, with service beginning in 1869. The original bridge was replaced in 1888. In 1912, the swing span was relocated upstream to create another bridge on a new alignment. The entire line across the rivers and Kearny Point was raised about to avoid conflicts with maritime traffic in the newly developing Port Newark.
In February 1946, a freighter damaged the HD Draw over the Hackensack, and when it was decided not to repair that bridge the railroad discontinued through service from its Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City. To minimize maintenance costs, the bridge over the Passaic was reduced from two tracks to one in 1955.
The Kearny station was an important stop for the railroad as it was within walking distance of the Western Electric plant and other key industries, such as the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Until the Aldene Plan was implemented in May 1967, the PD Draw was used for local passenger service between Kearny and CNJ's Broad Street Station and for local freight train service. The railroad also ran through-train service from point on its mainline and Newark Branch to the Kearny station; the last such service was a weekday rush-hour train between Kearny and Plainfield on April 29, 1967. After the Aldene Plan took effect, the bridge was used for a few years for local freight operations, but was taken out of service with the creation of Conrail on April 1, 1976.
In October 1970, in what was determined to be an act of sabotage, a 22-car freight train that included five engines was secretly assembled at the nearby railyard and intentionally let plunge from the bridge left in the open position, a standard procedure during overnight hours.
The center span of the bridge has been removed. The abutments and piers remain in place. The New Jersey Department of Transportation is considering building a new bridge along the alignment. Studies are being conducted as part of an extensive project conceived to facilitate freight transshipment through the Port of New York and New Jersey known as Portway. A new bridge could include a rail component. The new structure would allow for a dual bridge crossing in combination with the Lincoln Highway Passaic River Bridge.

Libys is a genus of coelacanth lobe-finned fish in the family of Latimeridae. Species of Libys lived during the Upper Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian - Tithonian, about 150 to 145 million years ago).
Description
Libys had an exceptionally squat body, especially when compared to other coelacanths of the same period as Undina and Holophagus. Libys could reach 60 centimeters in length and was therefore a medium-sized coelacanth, with a short and high skull. The pectoral fins were quite long, while the tail was remarkably short and high
Distribution
Fossils of these fishes have been found in Germany, in the famous deposits of Solnhofen.
Species
Libys superbus Reis, 1888
Libys polypterus
The genus Libys was erected in 1842 by Muenster. The species Libys polypterus was then established as the type species, on the basis of fragmentary remains. A second species, L. superbus, was described on the basis of complete large specimens, but most authors treat both as one species.

Jan Niezer (1756–1822) was a famous and influential Afro-European trader in the Dutch Gold Coast. In their day and age, they were the richest Mulatto trader on the Gold Coast. Furthermore, Niezer was an important political figure during the Ashanti wars of the early 19th century. Their most important trade interest was the Atlantic slave trade, until it was abolished by the Netherlands in 1814.
Biography
Niezer was born in Akwida as the son of a German doctor's assistant in the service of the Dutch West India Company, and an African woman named Manzang. They first travelled with their father to Europe in January 1764, where they attended school. Around 1770, Jan Niezer returned to the Gold Coast alone, joining the Dutch West India Company, like their father. After having worked for the company for 16 years, first as a soldier and later as an assistant of the civil administration, Niezer again went to Europe in 1785, presumably to employ themselves as a merchant with a European company. They signed themselves up with Louyssen & Son, one of the largest Dutch trading houses of the age, which among others occupied itself with the slave trade.
Back in the Gold Coast, Niezer encountered difficulty establishing themselves as a private trader, as they were not an official trader of the Dutch West India Company, and was thus hindered by the latter's trade monopoly. Nevertheless, they became one of the most influential traders in Elmina. When the Dutch East India Company was dissolved in 1791, Niezer took their chance to become the biggest private trader on the coast.
Move to Accra
In 1793, Niezer moved to Accra, since the slave trade in Elmina had become unprofitable due to Fante-Ashanti wars. Because of the conflict, Fante had blocked the so-called western trade route between Elmina and the Ashanti Empire. Accra was the endpoint of the so-called eastern trade route, which was safe from Fante and Akim disruptions. Furthermore, Accra was a trading point not only for the Dutch at Fort Crêvecoeur, but also for the British at Fort James, and the Danish at Fort Christiansborg, making Accra a safe place to establish oneself. In September 1794 Niezer wrote Louyssen that they were well-acquainted in the interior and that they were able to supply 500 slaves per year, as well as gold and ivory.
1794 was also the beginning of a twenty-year episode in the history of the Dutch Gold Coast, in which the colony was increasingly severed from its home country due to wars in Europe. The diminishing supply of goods from Europe did not bother Niezer too much, as they had no problems with trading with other European nations on the coast. This invited other problems, however, among others with the commander of the British Fort James, who ordered the bombardment of Niezer's property if Niezer once again tried to load slaves on a non-British ship.
In 1806, war arose between the people of Accra and other inhabitants of the coast on one side, and the Akuapem on the other. An Accra man named Apho allegedly betrayed their people in this war by signalling by drums where their people's army was. Apho then sought refuge with Jan Niezer, for whom they had worked earlier. Niezer gave the man refuge, which invited a mob of angry Accrans to burn and plunder their property. The Dutch and Danish commander tried to intervene in the conflict, as they had no interest in warring parties just outside their forts. Negotiations between the parties failed, however, leaving Niezer with no option but to release Apho to the mob, which subsequently killed him.
Back to Elmina
In the same year, the Ashanti–Fante War started as well. As the Ashanti had won the Battle of Abora, Niezer was confident that the western trade route would soon be open again, and left for Elmina. They left one of their sons behind to serve as their trade agent. In 1809, a battle ensued between coastal people and the Elminese. Jan Niezer supplied the Elminese with weapons and munition worth 11,000 Dutch guilders, and led a battle group of around 200 men against the aggressors. Elmina withstood the attack and was eventually liberated by an Ashanti army.
Arrest and journey to the Netherlands
In March 1818, Niezer was arrested by Herman Willem Daendels on the charge that they tried to incite the king of Elmina to kill Daendels. In May of the same year, Daendels died, however, bringing the Dutch administration on the Gold Coast in a difficult situation. The new administration did not feel much for continuing Niezer's trial, but could not let Niezer go without losing face. Niezer was then given the opportunity to defend themselves in the Netherlands, which Niezer gladly took up. Via Suriname they arrived in the Netherlands, where they were acquitted of all wrongdoing.
Last years on the Gold Coast
Little is known about Niezer's last years, but certain is that they returned to the Gold Coast on 18 February 1819. Their sons had in the meantime sold much of their property and spent most of their wealth, so that Niezer in 1821 was unable to pay the debt they owed in Cape Coast. In the same year, they also tried to set up a cotton plantation just outside Elmina, although this was not very successful.
In 1822, Niezer died in Elmina, 66 years of age.

Randall LeRoy Kennedy (born September 10, 1954) is an American law professor at Harvard University and author.  They are the Michael R. Klein Professor of Law and their research focuses on the intersection of racial conflict and legal institutions in American life. They specialize in contracts, freedom of expression, race relations law, civil rights legislation, and the Supreme Court.
Kennedy has written six books: Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity and Adoption; Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word; Race, Crime, and the Law; Sellout: The Politics of Racial Betrayal; The Persistence of the Color Line; and For Discrimination: Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law. Kennedy has also published several collections of shorter works. Many of their articles can be found in periodicals and newspapers, such as The American Prospect, The Nation, The Atlantic Monthly, Georgetown Law Journal, Harvard BlackLetter Journal, and The Boston Globe. Their book Race, Crime, and the Law won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award.
Early life and education
Randall LeRoy Kennedy was born on September 10, 1954, in Columbia, South Carolina, the middle child of Henry Kennedy Sr., a postal worker, and Rachel Kennedy, an elementary school teacher. They have two siblings, Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., a former United States District Court Judge for the District of Columbia, and Angela Kennedy, a lawyer at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia. Kennedy has said that tales of racial oppression and racial resistance were staples of conversation in their household. Their father often spoke of watching Thurgood Marshall argue Rice vs. Elmore, the case that invalidated the rule permitting only whites to vote in South Carolina's Democratic primary. Later that decade, fleeing the abuses of Jim Crow, their parents moved to Washington, D.C.
Kennedy attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and graduated cum laude with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1977 after completing an 135-page long senior thesis, "Richard Hofstadter: The Historian as Social Critic." They then studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, University of Oxford from 1977 to 1979 and at Yale Law School, where they received a J.D. in 1982. Kennedy served as an editor for the Yale Law Journal. They served as a law clerk for Judge J. Skelly Wright of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 1982–83 and for Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court in 1983-84. They were admitted to the Washington, D.C. bar in 1983.  They are a member of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of both the American Philosophical Association and the American Philosophical Society.
Personal life
In 1986, Kennedy married Yvedt Matory, a cancer surgeon. They have three children. Matory died on April 15, 2005, of complications from melanoma.
Career
Academia
In 1984 Kennedy joined the faculty at Harvard Law School, teaching courses on race, law, and freedom of expression. They first came to prominence as a legal-academic scholar when they began addressing affirmative action. In 1997, Kennedy published Race, Crime, and the Law, which received the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award in 1998. "This book is a brave, honest, forceful intervention in that debate", wrote William A. Galston and David Wasserman in the Wilson Quarterly, adding, "With restrained passion, they document the myriad ways in which our legal system has betrayed the principle of fair and equal treatment for African Americans." Kennedy argues in the book that African Americans have suffered at the hands of the criminal justice system, but also claims that blacks have committed a "notably large proportion" of the crimes that people are most afraid of (robbery, rape, murder, aggravated assault). They likewise argue that the need to protect black communities from crime has often been neglected. Galston and Wasserman wrote, "Too often, says Kennedy, black leaders show more concern for black perpetrators of crime than for their black victims."
Views
Kennedy is known as unafraid to tackle socially difficult issues, such as racism. They have written for academic and popular journals, published several books, and served on the editorial boards of the magazines American Prospect and The Nation. Kennedy has written extensively on interracial marriages and adoptions, and on the relationship between race and crime. Their views have garnered acclaim and controversy. "One of the things they [critics] find disconcerting is that I ask questions", Kennedy told Lawrence Donegan in the London Observer. "I actually question the premise of my own thinking and push my own conclusions hard. I thought that was what intellectuals were supposed to do." Despite the firestorm created by Kennedy's published work, Donegan said that Kennedy's "colleagues variously describe them as brilliant, well-read and personable."
In 2002, controversy erupted when Kennedy published Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word. "The power of 'Nigger,'" Charles Taylor wrote in Salon, "is that Kennedy writes fully of the word, neither condemning its every use nor fantasizing that it can ever become solely a means of empowerment." In the book, Kennedy explores the word's history, and how its meaning varies according to the context of its use. "I'm not saying that any particular instance of using the N-word is any more horrifying and menacing than any other such word", they told Daniel Smith in The Atlantic. "I am saying that from a broad sociological view, the word is associated with more havoc in American society than other racial slurs."
In Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity and Adoption (2003), Kennedy attempts to bring greater understanding to the racial issues that continue to trouble American society. "His premise is based on common sense", wrote Emily Bernard in Black Issues Book Review. "Until Americans confront racial bias in the most intimate arenas of their lives, we will continue to live with racism and its consequences." Unlike many black intellectuals, Kennedy supports interracial adoption. "Parenting is a mysterious thing", they told Lise Funderburg in Essence. "People will learn what they need to learn in order to help their child along. I'm willing to assume that with respect to all parents, including White people who want to adopt Black kids." Kennedy explores interracial marriages throughout American history as well as their presence in literature and film. "There is something hopeful in Kennedy's historical accounts", Bernard writes. "In spite of the law ... some individuals managed to maintain honorable and nuanced relationships with people they were legally forbidden to approach as equals."
Kennedy's views have been controversial even among other black intellectuals. Darcus Howe noted of Nigger in New Statesman, "Had a white person used the word, rejection would have been immediate. Now white society can always point to Kennedy and say that a negro advanced the view that 'nigger' is acceptable." Many black scholars have called their work conservative, and worry that books like Race, Crime, and the Law provide political cover for white conservatives. "Over the years", wrote Derrick Bell, "Professor Kennedy has become the impartial, black intellectual, commenting on our still benighted condition and as ready to criticize as commend." When asked by Kate Tuttle of Africana how they felt about the controversy over Nigger, Kennedy replied: "What's the worst that happens? That someone writes a very long diatribe in The New Yorker excoriating me...I'm not facing firing squads, I'm not facing exile, I'm not facing jail."
In March 2021, Kennedy participated in a debate hosted by Intelligence Squared US on the issue of slavery reparations, taking the position that they are "not an enemy of reparations, but has deep concerns about it". They said their principal objections were the waste of important time and energy on a "futile movement", administrative difficulties associated with reparations, that they poorly target those who are presently in need, and that reparations will likely have unintended consequences.
Current activities
Through numerous appearances on the lecture circuit, Kennedy continues to promote debate on hot-button racial issues in the public arena. "If you are socially isolated", they told Regan Goode in The New York Times, "you are more vulnerable to stereotypes and myths, you won't have the opportunity to have conversations with someone who has a different social background than you." While many critics have attempted to use Kennedy's work to advance their own agendas, they have retained their academic independence. "Against black pessimists", wrote Galston and Wasserman, argues that substantial progress has been made toward the ideal of color-blind justice. Against complacent whites, they argue that there is still a long way to go." According to Kennedy noted, the relationship between white and black America remains one of America's most perplexing problems. "Obviously there are all sorts of ethnic, racial conflicts in American society", Kennedy told Smith, "but there's one that is deeper than all the others and that's white/black racial conflict."
Kennedy served as a trustee of Princeton University from 1994 to 1998 and from 2005 to 2015. They also serve on the Board of Directors at The National Coalition Against Censorship.

The Sibi Bhagnari or Sibi is the largest breed of Zebu cattle and originates from Sibi in Baluchistan, though also found elsewhere in Pakistan and also India. The name is derived from the town of Bhag which is found to the south of Sibi and Naari which is a river that flows through the breeding area. The areas consist of Talli, Khajjak, Kurak, Mithri and Bhag. Each year the giant cattle are shown at the Sibi Mela.
Description
The breed typically has a white or grey coloured body and is black around the neck and has a black tail switch. The head is medium-sized with a short strong neck, small ears, short horns, small dewlap, straight back, wide chest and a moderate sized hump. Adult bulls can grow to in height with a mass of up to
The bulls of the breed surpass the Brahman by more than in mass. It is still been debated whether the Sibi is the biggest cattle breed in the world. Bulls have been shown to compete with Chianina.
Sibi Bhagnari together with the smaller White Nukra are the only indicine cattle which give complete white coloured animals. (Brahman is more white-greyish.)
Environment
Sibi are suited to extremes in conditions; in the breeding area it copes with a temperature range from and an average rainfall that is less than .
Farming
The cattle are mostly fed on dry fodder with sorghum used as green and grain. Other grains include wheat, barley, pearl millet which are fed to force weight gain. Other supplements include desi ghee, milk, yogurt, mustard oil, and occasionally eggs.

Memphis May Fire is the eponymous debut EP by American metalcore band Memphis May Fire. It was released on December 4, 2007 through Trustkill Records. This EP was the only official release by Memphis May Fire to feature Chase Ryan Robbins, the former vocalist who left the band in 2008 to focus on their newborn child. Guitarist Kellen McGregor described Ryan's contributions to Rock Sound, "Chase writes about dreams that make absolutely no sense. We're not a really serious band and that part is reflected in Chase's lyrics."
Josh Grabelle, president of Trustkill Records, commented on the band and this EP, "There is a lot of really exciting, young, dangerous music coming out of Texas right now, and Memphis May Fire are the cream of the crop. Not since Bullet for My Valentine's Hand of Blood EP have we heard a more compelling set of songs for an EP, where absolutely every song is bone-chillingly perfect, and timeless. These guys are on their way to something huge."

is a private university in Okayama, Okayama, Japan, established in 1964. It is predominantly a school of science and engineering.
Notable events
From 2015–2018, Okayama University of Science's operator, the group Kake Gakuen, applied for permission to open a new school of veterinary medicine in Ehime Prefecture, across the water from Okayama on the island of Shikoku. This school would be a branch of the Okayama University of Science. The government's aid in sweeping away regulatory concerns and speeding the process ignited accusations of corruption, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was friends with the owner of Kake Gakuen, Kotaro Kake.
In 2020, another controversy broke out after it was revealed that all ethnically Korean students applying to the university's recently added school of veterinary medicine in October 2019 were denied and failed with scores of zero (out of fifty) on their entrance examination.
Notable people
Graduates:
Yu Suzuki, an engineer and game programmer who worked for Sega and helped implement many of their famous video games
Koji Mise, a baseball player for Okayama's college team that went on to the Nippon Professional Baseball league

Providence Zen Center (PZC) is the Head Temple of the Americas for the Kwan Um School of Zen (KUSZ) and the first Zen center established by Seungsahn in the United States in October 1972. The PZC offers residential training where students and teachers live together under one roof, which was one of the hallmarks of Seung Sahn's philosophy concerning Zen practice in their organization. Practice at the center, and at Diamond Hill Zen Monastery, which shares the PZC property, includes sitting meditation, prostrations, and chanting.
The Providence Zen Center was originally located in Providence, Rhode Island, but in 1979 the center relocated to its current 50-acre site in Cumberland. One of the center's centerpiece landmarks is the Peace Pagoda, a towering high pagoda located at the front of the center grounds. PZC also serves as the U.S. headquarters for the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.
History
The Providence Zen Center was established by Seung Sahn in October 1972 on Doyle Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island as the first practice center for their American students. The center came to be after Brown University professor Leo Pruden had invited Seung Sahn to give talks on Buddhism at the university, with several of the students thereafter coming to them for teachings. After relocating in 1974 to 48 Hope Street, the PZC came into possession of a plot of land in 1978 located in Cumberland, Rhode Island.
During the 1980s the PZC became a catalyst for opening the dialogue on the role of women in Zen Buddhism, becoming host to various discussion panels and conferences on feminist issues in the years to follow. In 1982 the center organized a discussion group for woman at the center. Then in 1983 the PZC offered a workshop called "Feminist Principles in Zen," led by Barbara Rhodes, Maurine Stuart, Jacqueline Schwartz and Susan Murcott. In 1984 and 1985 the center held "Women in American Buddhism" conferences and, according to the book The Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America, "[f]rom then on women's retreats and conferences became common."
From 1983—1984 the Kwan Um School of Zen constructed Diamond Hill Zen Monastery on the grounds of PZC, a "low, pagoda shaped building" built in the "traditional Korean-style [of] architecture", which today hosts their semi-annual Kyol Che retreats. Originally designed as a training ground for those who were ordained, Seung Sahn expressed little interest in the training there. According to a longtime student of the Kwan Um School Mu Soeng, "[Seung Sahn] did not even insist that all their ordained American students make the monastery their home and contribute to its growth as a monastic center. To this day, the Diamond Hill Zen Monastery remains a minor footnote to Seung Sahn's missionary activities in America."
Kyol Che
Providence Zen Center annually holds a three-month Winter Kyol Che meditation retreat and a four-week Summer Kyol Che meditation retreat. The retreats are held at the Diamond Hill Zen Monastery.

Two human polls comprised the 1984 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-A football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship; instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.

The northern parula (Setophaga americana) is a small New World warbler. It breeds in eastern North America from southern Canada to Florida.
Description
The northern parula is one of the smaller North American migratory warblers, often being one of the smallest birds in a mixed feeding flock besides kinglets or gnatcatchers. Length is , wingspan is and body mass is . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . This species has mainly blue-gray upper parts, with a greenish back patch and two white wing bars. The breast is yellowish shading into the white belly. The summer male has bluish and rufous breast bands and prominent white eye crescents. At the end of the breeding season, individuals molt into a duller version of the breeding plumage. Females are similar-looking but tend to be duller and lack the breast bands. The unique breastband fades in males and may disappear altogether in females.
Its song is a click-like trill or buzz, zeeeeee-yip and the call is a soft chip.
Etymology
"Parula" ultimately derives from Latin parrula, Tit (bird). The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, "moth", and , "eating", and the specific americana is Latin for "American".
Distribution
This species is migratory, wintering in southern Florida, northern Central America, the West Indies and most of the Lesser Antilles. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.
While the species is still common as a breeder across most of eastern North America, there are conspicuous gaps in their breeding range that were likely once breeding grounds. They have been extirpated as a breeder from much of the Midwest as well as from many areas in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. Explanations for the disappearance may be changes in habitat or increasing air pollution, which limited the growth of epiphytes on trees that the warbler depended on for nesting. A further explanation is the clear-cutting and bog draining that have significantly reduced the amount of suitable habitat in eastern North America.
Habitat
The northern parula inhabits various habitats depending on season and location. This is primarily a forest-dwelling species, but the northern and southern breeding populations select different habitats. In general, abundance of this species has been found to be positively correlated with increased tree species diversity, canopy height, and percent canopy cover. Northern populations breed in mature, moist coniferous forests. This species constructs its pendulum nests in hanging vegetation and so it is often attracted to suspended clumps of moss or coniferous twigs that are more abundant in moist spruce bogs or hemlock swamps. Southern populations breed in mature, moist, bottomland forest where Spanish moss is prevalent. Outside of the breeding season, the northern parula becomes more of a habitat generalist and may be found in a wide variety of habitats during migration and winter. These habitats may include: pastures; moist, dry or wet forests; and agricultural fields or plantations.
Ecology
This is a monogamous species, however, a few cases of polygamy have been reported. Southern populations can start breeding as soon as March but to the north of the range, the species does not nest until May. The breeding habitat is humid woodland with growths of Old Man's Beard lichen or Spanish moss. Northern parulas nest in trees in clumps of these fungi (Old Man's Beard; Usnea) or plants (Spanish moss; Tillandsia usneoides), laying 3–7 eggs in a scantily lined cup nest. Sites located near water sources are preferred and many nests are found at the end of branches suspended over water. Due to their longer breeding season, southern parulas frequently raise two broods, as opposed to northern ones who raise only one. The female hollows out a clump of vegetation in the moss and proceeds to fill the cavity with vegetation fibers, animal hair, grass, or pine needles. These nests average in outside diameter. The incubation period typically lasts 12 to 14 days and the young fledge at 10 to 11 days. Breeding maturity is attained the following year.
The northern parula forages mostly or entirely on terrestrial invertebrates. Prey items include spiders, damselflies, locusts, bugs, grasshoppers, aphids, beetles, caterpillars, flies, wasps, bees, and ants. Regardless of season, caterpillars and spiders are consumed most often. During the winter, the northern parula consumes more beetles and occasionally forages on berries, seeds, and nectar. This species primarily captures prey from vegetation by a hover-glean method, however this species is versatile in using a variety of foraging methods. It may make short flights from a perch to snatch prey in mid-flight or even hang upside-down to forage. It is most often seen foraging in the mid- to upper canopy levels of vegetation. Though most foraging activity occurs in arboreal vegetation, this species occasionally forages on or around the ground as well.
A northern parula from Augusta, Georgia was found to be a host of an intestinal acanthocephalan worm, Apororhynchus amphistomi.
Northern parulas will occasionally hybridize with yellow-throated warblers, resulting in a hybrid species known as Sutton's warblers.

The Wave Federation Protocol (formerly Google Wave Federation Protocol) is an open protocol, extension of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) that is used in Apache Wave. It is designed for near real-time communication between the computer supported cooperative work wave servers.
Overview
Still currently in development, the Wave Federation Protocol is an open protocol that is intended to parallel the openness of the email protocol so waves may succeed email as the dominant form of Internet communication.
Availability
Since the protocol is open, anyone can become a wave provider and share waves with others. Like email, communication is possible regardless of provider. For instance, organizations can operate as wave providers for their members, an individual can run a private wave server for a single user or family members, and an Internet service provider can run a wave service as another Internet service for its users as a supplement to email, IM, FTP, etc. In this model, Google Wave is one of many wave providers.
Java source code for the "Google Wave Federation Prototype Server" was released in a Mercurial repository in July 2009 under the Apache License 2.0.
Framework
Some features of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol inherited by the wave federation protocol are the discovery of IP addresses and port numbers, using Domain Name System (DNS) SRV records, and TLS authentication and encryption of connections. The XMPP transport encrypts operations at a transport level. So, it only provides cryptographic security between servers connected directly to each other. An additional layer of cryptography provides end-to-end authentication between wave providers using cryptographic signatures and certificates, allowing all wavelet providers to verify the properties of the operation. Therefore, a downstream wave provider can verify that the wave provider is not spoofing wavelet operations. It should not be able to falsely claim that a wavelet operation originated from a user on another wave provider or that it was originated in a different context. This addresses the situation where two users from different, trustworthy wave providers are participants of a wavelet that is hosted on a malicious provider. The protocol requires each participant to sign its user's operations with its own certificate. The signatures of all the operations forwarded by the host will be evaluated by the participants. This is to stop malicious hosts from altering or spoofing the contents of the messages from the user of other services. All the signatures and verifications are done by the wave providers, not the client software of the end users.
All waves and wavelets (child waves) are identified by a globally unique wave id, which is a domain name and an id string. The domain name identifies the wave provider where the wave originated. Waves and wavelets are hosted by the wave provider of the creator. Wavelets in the same wave can be hosted by different wave providers. However, user data is not federated; i.e., not shared with other wave providers. Private reply wavelets are also possible, of which other participants have no knowledge or access. If a private wavelet is sent between users on the same wave provider, it's not federated regardless of where the parent wave is hosted.
Concurrent federation
A wave provider operates a wave service on one or more networked servers. The central pieces of the wave service is the wave store, which stores wavelet operations, and the wave server, which resolves wavelet operations by operational transformation and writes and reads wavelet operations to and from the wave store. Typically, the wave service serves waves to users of the wave provider which connect to the wave service frontend. For the purpose of federation, the wave service shares waves with participants from other providers by communicating with these wave provider's servers. Copies of wavelets are distributed to all wave providers that have participants in a given wavelet. Copies of a wavelet at a particular provider can either be local or remote. We use the term to refer to these two types of wavelet copies (in both cases, we are referring to the wavelet copy, and not the wavelet). A wave view can contain both local and remote wavelet copies simultaneously.
The originating wave server is responsible for the hosting and the processing of wavelet operations submitted by local participants and by remote participants from other wave providers. The wave server performs concurrency control by ordering the submitted wavelet operations relative to each other using operational transformation. It also validates the operations before applying them to a local wavelet.
Remote wavelets are hosted by other providers, cached and updated with wavelet operations that the local provider gets from the remote host. When a local participant submits a wavelet operation to a remote wavelet, the wave server forwards the operation to the wave server of the hosting provider. Then the transformed and applied operation is echoed back and applied to the cached copy.
Wave services use federation gateways and a federation proxy components to communicate and share waves with other wave providers. Federation gateways communicate local wavelet operations, push new local wavelet operations to the remote wave providers of any other participants, fulfill requests for old wavelet operations, and process wavelet operations submission requests. A Federation proxy communicates remote wavelet operations and is the component of a wave provider that communicates with the federation gateway of remote providers. It receives new wavelet operations pushed to it from other providers, requests old wavelet operations, and submits wavelet operations to other providers.

The Siegburg–Olpe railway or Agger Valley Railway ( or Aggertalbahn) is a single-tracked, non-electrified branch line in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Part of a direct link from Cologne, only the section from Overath to Gummersbach-Dieringhausen is still in operation. The section of line from Siegburg to Overath and from Dieringhausen to Olpe are closed.
The line is named after the River Agger, which it follows for a long way and crosses several times.
Significance
Although the line as always been considered by its operator as a branch line, it is central to the railway network of the Oberbergisches Land and it has been called a "secret" main line. Like the other lines in the region it primarily served local industry (mainly the textile and metal industries). Unlike, for example, the Wiehl Valley Railway (Wiehltalbahn), the line was not primary built to serve the quarry industry, it also used to connect to company sidings and to other branch lines. Passenger played only a secondary role from the beginning.
Despite the fears of critics, the line was initially very profitable: the line from Siegburg to Derschlag was the most profitable branch line between Cologne and Kassel. This section was opened in 1896 while its continuation to Bergneustadt was still being planned. Accounts from 1892/1893 show that it had revenues of 21,000 marks per kilometre. For comparison, the Wisser Valley Railway (Wissertalbahn) between Wissen and Morsbach generated only 6,800 marks per km.
The following standard gauge branch lines branched from the Agger Valley Railway:
the Cologne–Overath railway as a direct connection from the Oberbergisch district to Cologne
the Wiehl Valley Railway to Osberghausen
the Volme Valley Railway (Volmetalbahn) to Dieringhausen
the tramlines and freight sidings of the Gummersbach Light Railway (Gummersbacher Kleinbahnen) to Niedersessmar and Derschlag
the Finnentrop–Freudenberg railway to Olpe.
Up to the 1950s, there was also in Engelskirchen a loading bay of the metre-gauge Leppe Valley Railway (Leppetalbahn) to Marienheide and a very small narrow-gauge railway to Drolshagen.
In addition, during the two world wars and the occupation of the Ruhr, the line together with the Wiehl Valley Railway was historically significant as a diversion route for coal trains and other important traffic. In the 1970s it was used as a scenic railway.
Until the 1970s there were many sidings serving industrial companies such as Delta in Derschlag and Dörrenberg Edelstahl in Ründeroth.
The traffic on the now closed Siegburg–Overath section usually had only local significance. Following the opening of the Cologne–Overath railway, trains ran from Cologne to Dieringhausen or even Hagen. The timetable only included a service over the whole of the original line from Siegburg to Olpe until the Second World War.
There were also mostly only local passenger trains on the section between Dieringhausen and Olpe. There were few express trains in the timetable which ran to points outside the area. This was also one of the reasons for the closure of passenger services, partly caused by poor design, including the lack of a direct connection from Olpe to Gummersbach except via an awkward set of points in the Dieringhausen district.
History
Planning and construction
The first documented written discussions on a railway through the Oberbergische district date back to 1861. At that time, manufacturers founded a committee that planned a railway connection between Cologne and Kassel. This was originally intended to be a main line. This project did not materialise because the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) preferred a more northerly lines via Hagen and because of the problem of financing it—a main line would have cost 30 million gold marks. For comparison, the section from Bergneustadt to Olpe was priced at 3,367,000 marks in its building permit.
The planners of the Siegburg–Olpe railway preferred a direct connection to Cologne from the beginning rather than the indirect route via Siegburg. But at this time, there was still a military base in Cologne, which was in the way of the line. Another early plan proposed a line through the Agger valley from Siegburg to the Ruhr as part of the East Rhine Railway. This plan was rejected after the intervention of Cologne industrialists.
The Agger Valley Railway was the first major railway line inside the district of Oberbergischer Kreis. Before its construction, some critics claimed that its operations would not be profitable, so it was only agreed after long discussions and after the exertion of political pressure. The critics came mainly from the Cologne area because of its connection to Siegburg, as well as from the staff of the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company, which favoured a route to the north. The political pressure included the Prussian minister for railway at the time, Albert von Maybach, the most influential person in the region in relation to railway construction after Hermann von Budde.
The first railway connections in the region occurred in Brügge (in the municipality of Lüdenscheid) in, 1874, in Olpe in 1875 and in Wipperfürth in 1877. The connections there were too far from the Oberbergischer Kreis for passengers and profitable freight operations.
For cost reasons, the railway was built as a branch line. In most places it was built right next to the road, straight through the villages. This would still be a problem at the beginning of the 20th century. Further evidence of cost savings are the stations of Ründeroth and Derschlag. Their entrance building were previously at Recklinghausen and Recklinghausen Süd. Since they were no longer large enough, they were dismantled and re-erected on the Agger Valley Railway. In the case of the Derschlag station another source gives a different origin for the entrance building. An 1885 plan of the station indicates it was moved from Horst station (now in Gelsenkirchen) to Derschlag.
Completion to the end of the First World War
On 15 October 1884, the first train ran from Siegburg on the newly completed line to Ründeroth. It was initially frequented by only four pairs of trains. Protests led by local industrialists meant that the line was extended to Bergneustadt. The line came under direction of the railway division (Eisenbahndirektion) at Frankfurt in 1895 but almost all of it (from the 0.7 kilometer point) was transferred to the railway division at Elberfeld in 1897.
In 1893, in the Volme Valley Railway was built branching from Dieringhausen to Gummersbach station at the same time the original Niedersessmar station was renamed Gummersbach, where it is actually located. In 1897, the Wiehl Valley Railway, which branched from Osberghausen towards Waldbröl, was completed, which meant that Osberghausen station became a marshaling point.
Finally a line closing the gap to Olpe was approved in 1898. A height difference to the watershed to the Dörspe valley had to be overcome. The Wegeringhausen tunnel was also built nearby. The construction was problematic and its cost rose to nearly twice the estimate. It was completed on 11 February 1903. This newly built section of track was especially important for the villages between Bergneustadt and Olpe. These were previously connected by poorly maintained roads and trails and the area and had not even been connected by telegraph. Therefore, the population enthusiastically celebrated its completion for several hours, despite the long connecting times to Siegburg and Cologne. At the completion of the extension to Olpe, five pairs of passenger trains ran between Siegburg and Olpe and four more between Siegburg and Bergneustadt.</ref>
In 1910, the still operating section between Overath and Cologne was completed, ending through services between Siegburg and the Oberbergische district. This had a negative economic impact on Siegburg, because passengers now took the shorter, direct route to Cologne. The travel time from the Bergisches Land to Cologne was shortened to one and a half hours by the elimination of the detour via Siegburg and the old Siegburg–Overath route lost its importance.
Between 1910 and 1914, the line was relaid in many places on the hillside, as there had been many fatal traffic accidents and complaints of noise pollution in the area between Osberghausen and Derschlag. Between Niedersessmar and Derschlag the old track was used by passenger and freight trams operated at lower speed by the Gummersbach Light Railways (Gummersbacher Kleinbahnen). Between Vollmerhausen and Niedersessmar the old track was completely removed.
In 1913, a line was proposed to Eckenhagen. This 6.9 km long line was approved in March 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War, prevented its construction. Similarly, it was proposed in the 1920s to extend the Gummersbach Light Railways to Eckenhagen.
Weimar Republic to the end of the Second World War
The high reparations required by the Versailles Treaty led to a shortage of rolling stock and a limited timetable. But the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, when the French occupied the Ruhr region, meant that it became an important route for diverted coal trains. Thus the Agger Valley Railway towards Olpe along with the Wiehl Valley Railway and the Wisser Valley Railway (Wissertalbahn) and its connection to the Volme Valley Railway was one of the main lines in the new Weimar Republic for a few months. Due to the large amounts of heavy trains that ran on the line to the east, the cheaply built superstructure was damaged. The repairing of this damage took some time.
In 1927, a direct service to Cologne was opened. In this case, however, the Volme Valley Railway connection to the north was preferred to running to Olpe. Express trains to the north in 1931 included a connection from Wuppertal over the Wipper Valley Railway (Wippertalbahn), the Volme Valley Railway and the Agger Valley Railway to Olpe.
During the construction of Agger Valley Dam (Aggertalsperre) there was a high volume of commuters by immigrant workers to Derschlag, changing to the Gummersbach Light Railways to continue through Dümmlinghausen to Genkelmündung. A specially decorated pair of trains was operated for the transport of these workers to Derschlag, running from Cologne to Derschlag on Mondays and returning on Saturdays.
During World War II, mobile guns were installed on the line in Hützemert because the east-west link again played an important role as a diversion route. From 1943, the Oberbergische district was repeatedly bombed by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. Because of the stationed guns, the station and the railway depot in Dieringhausen were hit by a total of fifteen massive air raids by the end of the war. Among other things, the western half of the large entrance building and the eastern half of the roundhouse and turntable were destroyed. Part of the roundhouse was never rebuilt. The diversion route stopped because of destruction to the west by German troops under Hitler's scorched earth policy. Among other things, the Hoffnungsthal tunnel was destroyed by German troops. All trains had to operate via Siegburg.
After the Second World War
The reopening of the Hoffnungsthal tunnel on 14 May 1949 led to the abandonment of some rail services between Siegburg and Overath, there were now only local services. From 1949, all passenger services ran to Cologne. The Deutsche Bundesbahn railway division (Bundesbahndirektion) at Wuppertal informed locals from 1950 of the proposed closure of the western section, which took place after the thinning of services in 1954. Passenger services ended in 1956 due to roadworks.
Between Siegburg and Overath the steam train service was affectionately known as the Luhmer Grietche. At the beginning of the 1950s, the era of steam trains ended on the line. The steam trains were replaced by Uerdinger railbuses. However, it was reported that railbuses were often overcrowded especially for the carriage of school children in Bergneustadt. In addition, changes were required from Olpe–Dieringhausen services to Cologne. The transfer times in Dieringhausen were getting longer and meant that many passengers preferred buses. Deutsche Bundesbahn itself increasingly operated its own buses (Bahnbus), competing with its own rail services. There was an upsurge in passenger during the construction of the Bigge Valley Railway and the subsequent excursion trains and other tourist trains operated.
Hopes for a resumption of passenger service between Siegburg and Overath were dashed in 1959 with the issue of a license to close the line. In 1960, closure procedures commenced for the transport of freight between Lohmar and Overath, which were completed in 1962. The line between Lohmar and Overath was dismantled in the same year. The remaining part of the line between Siegburg and Lohmar was transferred to the jurisdiction of the railway division at Cologne.
The last regular passenger service operated between Olpe and Dieringhausen on 28 December 1979 despite protests from the public and local politicians.
Deutsche Bundesbahn closed freight operations between Bergneustadt and Wiedenest in 1985. An embankment collapsed due to poor construction near Wiedenest on 27 May 1989 and freight operations from Bergneustadt to Drolshagen were abandoned and the section was closed.
In 1993, the penultimate special passenger excursion train derailed in Derschlag. The damaged track was blocked and was beyond repair. The last passenger excursion train ran on 27 August 1993.
Freight traffic closed between Drolshagen and Eichen in 1991 and between Eichen and Olpe in 1993. On 13 May 1994, a class 290 diesel locomotive hauled the last freight wagon from Bergneustadt to Dieringhausen. Freight trains ran only between Dieringhausen and Niedersessmar until 1997, when the remaining track was closed.

The driver scheduling problem (DSP) is type of problem in operations research and theoretical computer science.
The DSP consists of selecting a set of duties (assignments) for the drivers or pilots of vehicles (e.g., buses, trains, boats, or planes) involved in the transportation of passengers or goods, within the constraints of various legislative and logistical criteria.
Criteria and modelling
This very complex problem involves several constraints related to labour and company rules and also different evaluation criteria and objectives. Being able to solve this problem efficiently can have a great impact on costs and quality of service for public transportation companies. There is a large number of different rules that a feasible duty might be required to satisfy, such as
Minimum and maximum stretch duration
Minimum and maximum break duration
Minimum and maximum work duration
Minimum and maximum total duration
Maximum extra work duration
Maximum number of vehicle changes
Minimum driving duration of a particular vehicle
Operations research has provided optimization models and algorithms that lead to efficient solutions for this problem. Among the most common models proposed to solve the DSP are the Set Covering and Set Partitioning Models (SPP/SCP). In the SPP model, each work piece (task) is covered by only one duty. In the SCP model, it is possible to have more than one duty covering a given work piece.
In both models, the set of work pieces that needs to be covered is laid out in rows, and the set of previously defined feasible duties available for covering specific work pieces is arranged in columns. The DSP resolution, based on either of these models, is the selection of the set of feasible duties that guarantees that there is one (SPP) or more (SCP) duties covering each work piece while minimizing the total cost of the final schedule.

On 13 May 2016, a group of militants armed with AK-47s attacked a cafe in Balad, Iraq, frequented by supporters of the Spanish football club Real Madrid. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack. At least 16 people were killed and at least 30 were wounded.
On 29 May 2016, ISIL gunmen and a suicide bomber attacked another Real Madrid fan club in the same area, killing at least 12 people and injuring around 15. They were attacked while watching the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final.
Events
During the first attack on May 13, around 50 fans of Real Madrid were gathered in a café in Balad, to discuss their arrangements for their favorite team's upcoming football match, when six armed men stormed into the café and started to shoot at the young men. Reports claim that grenades were also used to attack those gathered to watch the match. Several attackers reportedly fled the cafe and then detonated themselves, one was captured but then burned to death.
At least 14 people were killed outright and two more died of their wounds later on. More than 30 people were injured.
Responsibility
Survivors of the attack blamed the attack on May 13 on ISIL and its opposition to football.
In its claim of responsibility, ISIL said the attack had targeted Shia militiamen, making no mention of any connection to Real Madrid. Some believe that the claim stems from the extremist groups ideology against football, as they believe it is a product of western society.
Reaction
The attack was condemned by soccer fans around the world. Javier Tebas Medrano the President of Spain's La Liga responded to the attack with the statement "Terrorism has attacked football. We are with the victims and their families." The Real Madrid football club itself expressed "great sadness" and offered its "regards and condolences" to the families and friends of the victims. Real Madrid players wore black armbands for their away game against Deportivo de La Coruña, on 14 May 2016, as a mark of respect. The team also honoured the victims by observing a moment of silence before their match.
On May 28, 2016 family and friends of victims gathered at the cafe to watch the game, surrounded by armed police, frisking those who attempted to enter the cafe.
After the second attack, Florentino Pérez, the club president, dedicated Real Madrid's win to the fans that were killed, and other Iraqi club fans, including those killed by ISIS. Alaa al-Hashemi, the Iraqi ambassador to Spain, thanked the club and invited the president to visit Iraq.

Harry Daniel Payne (1891–1987) was an American architect and engineer; protégé of noted St. Louis Architect, William Ittner. Payne is most known for building designs in the U.S. State of Texas after 1926, but before this as a member of the Ittner Firm, they designed schools and hospitals in other states. Payne was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and was trained at Washington University in St. Louis. Upon graduation, they attended Fort Sheridan Officers Training School, and served in World War I in Company H, 320th Infantry, 80th Division. On September 25–26, 1918 they fought in the Meuse-Argone Offensive, leading men of H Company to take Dead Man's Hill (Le Mort Homme). Payne received a battlefield commission to Captain just before the Armistice. They returned to St. Louis after the war to work with the Ittner form until 1926. That year they were recruited by Houston School Board to design all new schools for the city. After this contract was completed they went on to design schools, jails, office buildings, stadiums, houses and museums in Texas including for Anahuac ISD, Beaumont ISD, Corpus Christi ISD, Houston ISD, and Huntsville ISD.
After December 7, 1941, Payne tried to secure the renewal of their WWI Commission as Captain, but was refused because of disabilities resulting from injuries in the First World War. They found an outlet for their desire to serve by applying at Brown Shipbuilding in Houston where they worked on the design of destroyers, frigates escorts and landing craft. The USS Stewart is one surviving example of this work.
Payne was an active member of the American Institute of Architects, and was awarded the Edward C. Kemper Award by the organization in 1962.

Cameraria ulmella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Ontario and Québec in Canada, and Texas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Georgia, Illinois and Connecticut in the United States.
The wingspan is 6.5–7 mm.
The larvae feed on Quercus alba, Quercus ilicifolia, Quercus rubra, Quercus velutina and Ulmus species (including Ulmus americana, Ulmus fulva and Ulmus rubra). They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a flat mine on the upperside of the leaf. The pupa of the summer brood is formed under a flat silken cocoon. A later hibernating brood changes from the usual green color to a pale yellow color, and passes the winter in silk lined chambers.

Joseph Barritt (1816 – 17 August 1881) was a pastoralist and politician in the colony of South Australia.
History
Barritt was born in Hazeleigh, near Maldon, Essex, and emigrated to South Australia on the Anna Robertson in 1839 with an introduction to John Barton Hack, a fellow Quaker for whom they ran a farm. They next ran a farm for John Richardson, later taking up their own properties "Woodlands" around 1856 then "Riverside" around 1859, both in the Lyndoch Valley.

A semi-structured interview is a method of research used most often in the social sciences. While a structured interview has a rigorous set of questions which does not allow one to divert, a semi-structured interview is open, allowing new ideas to be brought up during the interview as a result of what the interviewee says. The interviewer in a semi-structured interview generally has a framework of themes to be explored.
Semi-structured interviews are widely used in qualitative research; for example in household research, such as couple interviews. A semi-structured interview involving, for example, two spouses can result in "the production of rich data, including observational data."
Comparison to other types of interviews
An unstructured interview is the opposite of structured interview, because it tends to be more informal and free flowing and it is more like an everyday conversation. A structured interview is a type of interview that is completely planned, which means every interviewee gets the same interview questions. A semi-structured interview is the one in between. The questions are loosely structured and give interviewees more opportunities to fully express themselves. However, semi-structured interviews are less objective and legally harder to defend when compared with structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews somewhat restrict the interviewee's free flow of thoughts which limited the potential possibility of the interview as a whole.
Because semi-structured interview is a combination of both structured interviewing and unstructured interviewing, it has both of their advantages. For interviewers, the constructed part of semi-structured interview gives them a general overview of the interviewees. It helps them draw an objective comparison from the interviewees, which is helpful for either qualitative research study or job interview. For interviewees, because the unstructured part of semi-structured interview gives them more space to ask for clarification on answers and to express free flow of thoughts, the interviewees normally feel less stress during the interview. They would present more communication skills to the interviewers and build personal bond with them under the relatively warm and friendly atmosphere.
Advantages and disadvantages
Advantages
Since a semi-structured interview is a combination of an unstructured interview and a structured interview, it has the advantages of both. The interviewees can express their opinions and ask questions to the interviewers during the interview, which encourages them to give more useful information, such as their opinions toward sensitive issues, to the qualitative research. And they could more easily give the reasons for their answers during the interviews. Plus, the structured part of semi-structured interviews gives the interviewers reliable, comparable qualitative data as well.
Disadvantages
Even though a semi-structured interview has several advantages, it needs time for the interviewers to prepare and do research before actually starting the interview. And in order to make the results reliable, interviewers need to meet an adequate number of people to conduct the interview. Since it allows people to freely express their thoughts, the interviewers need to carefully plan the questions to make sure they can get the answers they want, which also requires good communication and interviewing skills. Interviewers are responsible for the confidentiality of the interviews.
Interview guides
The specific topic or topics that the interviewer wants to explore during the interview are typically thought about well in advance—especially during interviews for research projects. It is generally beneficial for interviewers to have an interview guide prepared. An interview guide is an informal grouping of topics and questions that the interviewer can ask in different ways for different participants. Interview guides help researchers to focus an interview on the topics at hand without constraining them to a particular format. This freedom can help interviewers to tailor their questions to the interview context/situation, and to the people, they are interviewing.
There are several things for interviewers to pay attention to while preparing and conducting their interviews. When preparing for the semi-structured interview, the interviewers need to consider the characteristics of their questions. They should use open-ended questions but dichotomous questions which only lead to two opposite answers, and they should avoid asking multiple questions, leading questions or why questions. It is helpful for the interviewers that they have a scale for grading the answers prior to the interview. The drawback of the leading question is that it could subtly orient interviewers toward a certain way. And the downside of why questions is they can make the questions sound judgmental and might generate negative answers. During the interview, interviewers could try to restate and summarize the interviewees' answers to confirm their opinions. They could generate new questions based on interviewers' answers, but the questions should be around the particular qualities and experiences that they are looking for in interviewers. It is also helpful to take detailed notes or recording the whole interview to compare the answers afterward.
Ethical considerations
Because semi-structured interviews allow people to communicate and express their free flow of thoughts at some degrees, the interviewers need to pay attention to their intercultural competence and cultural dimensions during the communication. Intercultural competence requires people to recognize and respect the diversity of different cultural backgrounds.
People with high intercultural competence often tend to respect individual variations and different cultural patterns. They often have self-assessments and are aware of the differences between people. They make their conclusions and assessments based on reliable evidence. People can improve their intercultural competence by regular self-assessments including their values, beliefs and personal biases to improve their self-awareness. The interviewers need to understand that their personal beliefs and biases may slightly impact the way they address questions and, as a result, influence the outcomes of semi-structured interviews.
Interviewers are also required to realize the cultural dimensions. Lack of the recognition of cultural dimensions could lead to miscommunication and unpleasant results during semi-structured interviews. Having high level of cultural dimensions can be reflected as, for example, respecting masculine, individualistic, uncertainty avoidance cultures.

First Light was an English funk project of Paul Hardcastle.
Overview
Paul Hardcastle and Derek Green were originally members of the Brit funk band Direct Drive, however at the end of 1982, they decided to leave the band and become a duo. Following their formation, they released the single "Don't Be Mistaken". In early 1983, they released their eponymous debut album which featured the song "Explain the Reasons". It reached No. 65 in the UK Singles Chart the same year. The follow-up single was "Wish You Were Here"; which peaked at No. 71 on the same chart.
After the release of their second and last album Daybreak in 1984, Hardcastle and Green parted ways. Green moved to other projects and Hardcastle pursued a solo career.
In 1989, Hardcastle resumed working on First Light. This time they worked with Kevin Henry who had previously provided vocals on their solo work. Produced and arranged entirely by Hardcastle, the new album You Had It All was issued on the Sgt. Peppers record label. Four subsequent singles from the album were released.
In 2010, Hardcastle released a jazz album under the name First Light called East to West.
