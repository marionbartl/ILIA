OTTAWA—A Liberal bill that would make it easier for people to become Canadian citizens has passed the Senate, after over a year of back-and-forth in Parliament. Bill C-6 was designed to repeal many of the previous Conservative government's changes to how people become citizens — and how they can lose that status.

Among other things, the legislation repeals a provision that strips dual citizens of their Canadian status if convicted of terrorism, treason or espionage. But far more people lose their citizenship because it was obtained fraudulently and current law gives them no right to appeal, something not addressed in the Liberals' original bill. The Senate proposed adding such an appeal and the Liberals agreed to that and several other amendments late last week.

The bill went back to the Senate and after a brief debate, passed by a vote of 51-29. Former immigration minister John McCallum introduced the bill in 2016, following through on a Liberal campaign promise that had in part spawned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's famous “A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian” line during the heated debates of the 2015 election. The issue was the Conservatives' citizenship law, which allowed for stripping citizenship from dual nationals convicted of certain serious crimes. It has been applied to one person: Zakaria Amara, convicted for his role in a 2006 terror plot in Toronto and his citizenship is now likely to be reinstated. The Liberals' original bill makes two other changes: restoring the age range for language and knowledge requirements for citizenship to 18 to 54 from 14 to 64. One of the Senate amendments had sought to raise the upper age to 59 but the Liberals did not accept that.
The other change in the bill repeals a Conservative provision that required people to say they intended to reside in Canada as part of their citizenship application. Among the notable Senate amendments was one allowing people a right to appeal if their citizenship were to be revoked because of fraud.

The Liberals accepted it, though their hand was forced a bit after a recent Federal Court ruling saying citizens deserved an independent hearing before their status was revoked. The Opposition Conservatives have condemned that move, saying it risks encouraging people to lie on their application, because of the lengthy appeals process. They say their process — which left decisions on revocation in the hands of the bureaucrats — was more efficient, and court appeals were still possible if the law was wrongly applied.
1981 Audi Quattro Reading time: about 2 minutes. Cars
Engineering
German
Rally
The original Audi Quattro, retroactively named the Ur-Quattro, is almost certainly the most important vehicle ever manufactured by the German automaker. The Quattro name is still used to denote all-wheel drive cars built by Audi, but with a lowercase “Q” in deference to the original car, which almost singlehandedly changed the face of international rallying.
The original concept for the Quattro is credited to Audi chassis engineer Jörg Bensinger, who in 1977 during the development of the 4×4 Volkswagen Iltis. It was discovered that on snow, the Iltis could outpace any other vehicle regardless of the horsepower deficit, thanks to its 4×4 system.
Jörg started developing an all-wheel drive version of the pre-existing Audi 80 in with Walter Treser (Audi Director of Pre-Development), they used a modified version of the Volkswagen Iltis drivetrain – and the concept proved to be a significant performance boost, especially when on slippery terrain.
Audi started selling the Quattro in late-1980 fitted with a 2.1 litre inline-5-cylinder 10 valve SOHC engine, with a turbocharger and an intercooler. In street trim the engine produced 197 hp and 210 ft lbs of torque, with the initial competition versions being tuned to produce 300 hp.
The Quattro began racing competitively in 1980 at the Janner Rally in Austria, the car proved successful and by 1982 when the development had progressed to a suitable level, Walter Röhrl took the World Rally Manufacturer's Championship for Audi, in 1983 and 1984 it won the Driver's Championship in the hands of Hannu Mikkola and Stig Blomqvist respectively, and in '84 it also took another Manufacturer's Championship win.
Audi kept the road legal version of the Quattro in production from 1980 till 1991 with significant changes over the years, today they're considered highly collectible and values have been climbing year on year.
The Quattro you see here is though to be the first one brought into Britain, it was used as a press test and demonstrator car before being assigned to David Sutton Motorsport's official Audi Rally Team.
It was used extensively as a back-up and reconnaissance car, and it was used as the official practice car for the Acropolis Rally in Greece. The car is now being offered for sale as a road legal race car, with an extensive history file and a long list of lower level race entries from after its days with the official Audi Rally Team.

Scientists have discovered that a cheap and common sponge they use to clean surfaces and equipment in their lab has a very high capacity to absorb bisphenol A (BPA).
‘It was an accidental discovery,' says Wei Qiu, from the University of Massachusetts, US, one of the researchers involved. ‘There was a big tank of waste BPA solution and while we were testing some other absorbent materials we accidentally dropped a sponge into the solution. We were curious and when we tested the waste solution we found a significant drop in BPA concentration and the only thing that could account for that drop was the sponge.'
BPA is a building block for polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins and, despite currently being phased out of industrial processes, has become a significant pollutant in industrial wastewaters. Environmental and health concerns associated with BPA have drawn researchers to find methods to reduce its presence.
The polyurethane sponge has fibrils that swell when they absorb liquid. Carbonyl and polyol groups on the fibrils hydrogen bond with guest BPA molecules diffused into the foam.
Lead scientist Jie Han explains how they recycle the foam: ‘We use an alkaline solution to deionise the hydrogen bonded BPA, which can then be washed off the material and recovered by neutralising the resultant alkaline solution. Compared with other sorbents like activated carbon or polymer resins this process is really easy.' The sponge could be used up to 25 times with no sign of deterioration.
It is possible to make the foam in a variety of sizes, geometries and densities making it suitable for various sorption processes. ‘One particularly good thing about this material is its abundance and low cost,' says Qiu, ‘combining its high flow rate and high sorption rate produces a very high treatment capacity, which is exciting for real application.'
Environmental materials scientist Saravanan Pichiah from the University of Malaya, Malaysia, comments that this kind of work ‘is an awakening idea for the implication of such commercial grade polymeric materials for environmental cleanup.'

Days after the owners of Indiana's Memories Pizza made headlines for declaring they wouldn't cater to same-sex weddings, other companies have followed suit, this time in Georgia.
Flower shop employee Jennifer Williams told CNN's Gary Tuchman that she "couldn't" serve a same-sex couple who sought arrangements for their union.
"It doesn't mean that I love them any less, because I don't," Williams said. "You can still love someone even if you don't serve them."
A second florist, Melissa Jeffcoat, felt similarly.
"I would respectfully tell them that I'm sorry, I just don't want to do it because of my beliefs," she said. "[Jesus] died on the cross for me, so that's the least I can do for him."
Interestingly, she said that she would willingly serve a customer who committed adultery, but not a gay person: "It's just a different kind of sin to me, and I just don't believe in it."
Jeffcoat's son, Carlton, echoed those sentiments, noting, "I serve a God who's higher than any Supreme Court judge."
Georgia's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which mirrored Indiana's controversial legislation, failed to get final passage April 2, and never made it out of a House committee. Coca-Cola was among the Georgia-based corporations to decry the bill.
Notification of planned clearing is up 30% in the past year compared with the previous three-year average
A dramatic land-clearing surge in Queensland could turn into a “tsunami” in the coming year, say conservationists, the rate of notifications of planned clearing rising 30% in the past year compared with the previous three-year average.
If that translates to a 30% jump in land clearing, Queensland – a region already marked as a global deforestation hotspot – could experience rates of land clearing seen just twice since detailed observations began in the 1980s.
For the love of Queensland, this land clearing has got to stop | Lyndon Schneiders Read more
Since July last year, 1,608 properties in Queensland have notified an intention to clear a total of almost 945,755 hectares of land. Almost all of it is “remnant” forest or bushland – a term used to describe forest that hasn't previously been cleared. There was also an additional 80,200ha of “high-value agriculture” land approved for clearing, making a total of 1.02m hectares of clearing in the pipeline.
If it goes ahead it would undo the work of more than $1bn the federal government has spent paying other landholders not to clear their land, in order to cut carbon emissions under the Coalition's Direct Action policy.
The number of notifications over the period amounted to almost 115 a month – a roughly 30% increase from the rate of fewer than 90 per month seen in the preceding three years.
Before July 2016, the Queensland government didn't release the area of land in each clearing notification, so the relative jump in area that is earmarked for clearing cannot be accurately compared.
The rise in planned clearing – which could be a sign of “panic clearing” before a planned crackdown if Labor is re-elected – would also cause a spike in sediment washing onto the Great Barrier Reef, which the United Nations has warned is threatening joint Queensland and federal government plans to improve water quality on the reef.
Only a small fraction of land clearing in Queensland needs to be notified, meaning the actual amount of planned clearing is much larger.
The federal government has been using the $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund to pay polluters – mostly potential land clearers – not to clear. In the most recent auction, the government paid $11.82 for each tonne of CO2-equivalent of greenhouse gasses that were abated.
The more than 1m ha of land earmarked for clearing would result in more than 90m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. That means the earmarked clearing would wipe out more than $1bn worth of carbon abatement.
“There's a tsunami of deforestation hitting Queensland right now,” said Wilderness Society Queensland campaign manager Gemma Plesman. “It's insane that nearly 1m hectares has been targeted for clearing from July 2016 to September 2017 or already has been cleared. That's an annual rate of 830,000ha – that's twice as much as the record 395,000ha cleared in 2015-16.”
The figures come amid an election campaign in which tree-clearing policy has been marked as a key point of difference between the parties. In their current term of government, Labor attempted to pass legislation to stop the surge caused by the previous LNP government, but failed to get the numbers. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has taken a policy to the election that intends to stop the runaway deforestation, a pledge that has been applauded by conservation groups.
Plesman said: “The LNP, which started this free-for-all, wants this madness to continue, while One Nation's policy is even worse. It's only the Labor party and the Greens that want to stop this lunacy.”
Two thirds of the proposed clearing is being done under contentious rules over “thinning”, which allow clearing of 75% of the trees on a site without approval.
The news comes a month after Queensland released its annual satellite monitoring report, showing that clearing in 2015-16 jumped 33% compared with the previous year.
At the time, the environment minister, Steven Miles, said the report was “nothing short of devastating” because of the effects on wildlife, reef waters and coral, and Australia's carbon emissions.
WWF Australia found that clearing would have killed nearly 45m animals. According to a study published in the journal Nature in October, Australia is the second-worst country for species loss.
Plesman said: “Deforestation in Queensland is a national disgrace. Queensland now ranks alongside the Amazon, Borneo and the Congo as a world top 10 deforestation hotspot, and will likely move further up that unwanted ladder if this proposed clearing takes place.”
MILAN - President Erick Thohir spoke to inter.it:
"After the close of the January transfer window and the game in Turin, I feel it is appropriate for me to outline our sports strategy.
"We are going through a transition year and our main aim is to lay the foundations for our future: this is a difficult season and clearly it is not easy to find another winning combination like the one we had a few years ago.
"This is why we must be patient and move forward with a clear vision focusing on two basic concepts: how to improve our performance on the pitch and how to build our team for the future.
"To achieve the first target we have hired one of the best Italian coaches in circulation, Walter Mazzarri, with whom we are working for the present and planning for the future. The signings of Hernanes and D'Ambrosio - chosen by myself, our management and the coach in unison - are indicative in that sense: two key players who can help this club get going again. They will undoubtedly contribute greatly both this year and in the coming seasons.
"Regarding the future it's important to stress that we have not yet taken any decisions about the players who currently make up our roster: the coach's assessment at the end of the Serie A season will be decisive in that respect. I will sit down and discuss with him which players possess the necessary qualities and motivation to remain with us, and which players are to make way for new faces.
"Of course this is not forgetting that we would all like to return to the European stage as soon as possible, and with our fans' support and passion we will start fighting again, from this Sunday, to achieve the best possible result this season. Forza Inter!"

Today's guest post comes from Eamon Hamilton ( @eamonhamilton ), who, like a modern day Bruce Wayne, has two lives. By day, he does Public Affairs with the Royal Australian Air Force. By night, he stands with those who over-analyse the Star Wars films. He can be found writing here
Mom,
I suppose it's too early to hope that Dad's forgiven me for leaving you all (and my studies) behind, but I write this letter so that you may hear that I am in good health, and made it safely to the Rebellion.
I still don't regret walking away from university, and I know what the family thinks of the faculty for talking me into it (especially Professor Tyree). But, after that student protest against the destruction of Alderaan, I knew in my heart that I didn't have a choice. I was set on taking a stand against the tyranny of the Empire.
Still, there are a couple of things that I've seen since I joined the Rebellion that have really, really opened my eyes.
Our whole operation is so god damned loose. There was very little formal induction when I arrived, and almost no basic training. A guy literally gave me my uniform and rank patch, and assigned me a job he thought I'd be good at. When I asked them about an Officer Training program, they told me their Academy had been vaporised by Walkers a month ago.
I was expecting to learn how to handle a blaster, but because we're on a starship, we have no firing range – I have to learn how to use a DH17 blaster entirely on my datapad. (Image courtesy Lucasfilm Ltd)
Whilst my studies at University are incomplete, my skillsets have never-the-less been a welcomed by the Rebellion. On my first day here I was asked about my skillsets, and I told them that I was a second-year Business Undergrad with a minor in Corellian Lit. Now, I am responsible for supply management and warehouse stocktake for the Rebellion in the entire Outer Rim. No joke. It's my job to ensure 2.5 million Rebel soldiers, techs and crew are being adequately fed, clothed, and equipped to fight the Empire – it is a war unto itself. I should count myself lucky though. Other guys who arrived here with me had less than 200 hours of T-16 Skyhopper experience, and flew Starfighters on combat sorties the next day.
That level of trust from the Rebels might make the family proud – hell, I think even Dad could manage a smile. But the reality is a nightmare. There are bases in systems I've never even heard of. Ensuring timely and accurate supply of stores to the Rebellion is a job that could be best done by a machine, because before me, it was. A Protocol Droid was responsible for managing all of this before I arrived, but High Command felt too many people were knocking it out of the way so that they could just take what they needed from the stores. Now I manage all of the stock requests too, so that High Command has a sentient being in the chain. When I tell Rebels they can't have something, I'll get called an obstructionist – or worse, told I'm “helping the Empire”. If they're not human, they'll tell me I'm a racist to boot. Astromechs will usually trundle out of my office making a sad wail. All the while, the Protocol Droid whose job I took is still here, standing in the corner and quoting supply regulations at me all day.

Most of the issues I have are just on this starship alone. We have 42 sapient species serving onboard, which means we have 42 individual dietary needs, uniform styles, and living requirements. The warehouse on board was built to serve just Mon Calamari. High Command just assumes it's OK that our stores will suit everyone's needs equally, but they're hopelessly wrong. Bothans are allergic to synthetic fabric. Sullustans stretch the neck holes on all tunics we give them. When my Droid suggests a Twi'lek use the same bunk lining as a Devaronian because they're both from similar planets, I get called in to mediate another diversity counselling session between the aggrieved parties.
We raid Imperial convoys from time to time, but the stock we steal from them is optimised for for humans. Our own supplies are almost always next to useless. One of the GR75 transports made it to us from Hoth carrying 60 tonnes of Mon Calamari food stores that had been in cold storage. Pretty much all of Rogue Squadron is allergic to shellfish, and Commander Antilles is on my case to provide him with field rations (I told him to use the emergency supply in his X-Wing – he wasn't happy).
These are just an illustration of the struggles I face on a daily basis. I usually get my first one at 0300hrs, when someone wakes me to say an attack is being launched by Gold Squadron (always, always Gold Squadron) in just a few hours. They'll have been planning this op for weeks, but only thought to requisition proton torpedoes the night before. Despite all the requisition briefs I give them and High Command instructions that get handed down (I usually get General Rieekan to lay the guilt trip on them – he's perfected the ‘I'm-very-disappointed-in-you' delivery to Gold Squadron CO), you can't change them. I don't get much more sleep before breakfast.
Every time High Command wants to remove funding for Gold Squadron's Y-Wings, General Salm leads another insurrection against them and keeps it in service for another two years, which means I've got to find spare parts for it. I hate these ships now with a passion. (Courtesy Lucasfilm Ltd)
After breakfast, I'll head into our morning brief at 0800hrs. Thanks to me, our ship's briefing room now has a holographic projector, and sometimes we'll get briefed in on a major raid or counter-attack against the Empire, so I get a good feeling about the work we're doing. Not everyone knows how to effectively brief with the holoprojector though, and most of our presentations aren't about attacking the Empire. Our starship's administration officer subjected us to a three-hour presentation (no breaks) this morning on ‘how to effectively assess risk within the workplace'. Each holoprojection was just another page of text that he read aloud. I was about ready to jump into the airlock by then end of it.
After the brief, I'll head into a Command meeting latter that morning to discuss stores and equipment. If we're running low, they'll almost always say “we should raid another convoy” (which is usually the root of our supply problems in the first place. There's no guarantee they'll give us what we need. One time we captured an entire container ship of Darth Vader's gloves – who knew that he went through so many). I'll put forward my list of recommendations and suggestions, and if I'm ambitious, will ask if we can capture a planet with a good manufacturing industry. I'm almost always ignored, depending on who is listening.
On an unrelated note – guess what I'm getting everybody for Life Day this year! (Courtesy Lucasfilm Ltd)
All of High Command has their own unique experience and agenda, which either helps or hinders. General Dodonna's been around since the Republic, so he's old and will often say some pretty inappropriate things. Admiral Ackbar is a good fleet operator who gets logistics, but he will not stop telling stories about when he was Aide de Camp to Grand Moff Tarkin 20 years ago. Seriously, guy, get over it. General Madine meanwhile just defected to us from the Empire, and you can't half tell he's used to getting what he wants – yesterday he requested an entire squadron of Lambda Shuttles for a training exercise that he wanted to run on Chandrila. I think I've seen one Lambda the entire time I've been here, and it's been reserved exclusively for Mon Mothma.
At least General Madine held a rank (although I heard someone say that he was only an acting Colonel when he left the Empire). General Calrissian is another matter. You might remember him as that guy who became Mayor of Bespin after he won a card game. That's good facility administrative experience I guess (we all kind of hoped he'd be sent to be the new Commandant of our Staff College, but you guessed it – vapourised by Walkers). But the guy has no formal record of military service, which means he has less of an idea about our business than I did when I arrived. Worse yet, he outranks everyone significantly. General Calrissian asked me in his first week where he could get a massage on our ship. He constantly complains about us speaking in acronyms (we do, but it's his fault for not understanding them). He'll then use a bunch of smuggler's slang that nobody has heard of, then brag about how he pulled a little manuever in the ‘Battle of Tanaab'. I searched Tanaab on my datapad – the page had been removed by the ship's content manager. I'll make some enquiries later.
When he arrived, he added a non-issued cape to his uniform. Now everyone on the god damned ship is telling me they need a cape. (Courtesy Lucasfilm Ltd)
If I'm lucky, there might be time for PT in the afternoon, though that time usually gets co-opted by a last minute panicked request from someone like General Rieekan to do a stocktake of all explosive ordnance on the ship (which, by the Empire's own regulations, we're in dangerous violation of – but our safety margin is significantly lower, so somehow we're OK). I'm not too fussed about missing out on the gym, because Major Derlin's Commandos have usually taken all of the equipment.
Dinner is from 1800hrs, but for the last three days running, I've been held back in the hangars because a smuggling ship has left with goods/payment more valuable than what they delivered.
Unless it's this freeloading jerk, who will just. Not. Go. Away. (Courtesy Lucasfilm Ltd)
There's more I could say, but I feel like I've shared enough of my experiences for one transmission. I'm needed in a warehouse meeting with General Reekan to decide what we're going to do with 50,000 snow uniforms, especially seeing as High Command decreed after Hoth that “the Rebel Alliance will no longer operate major operating bases on ice planets”. My suggestion that we just space the entire stock and leave it floating until we need it again was not well received.
Give my best to the family, my love to Karoleen, and I hope to hear from you soon.

About This Game Haven Moon will transport you to a mysterious world where you have to explore abandoned islands and solve their secrets to find a treasure. In this Myst-like game inspired by Jules Verne's universe, use your senses and intelligence to find your way through secret passages and curious machinery. THE STORY You are teleported to Seleos, the moon of the planet Menra. In front of you, a metal box opens, and inside, you find a note from Ektor Turren, the only survivor of a cataclysmic event that destroyed his world. In his note, he explains that he wishes to leave you the treasure that he accumulated during his whole life.
From that, you'll have to explore the islands on Seleos to discover who was Ektor Turren, what happened to him and to his world, where to find the treasure and how to go back home with it. GAMEPLAY The gameplay is based on exploration, observation, listening and problem-solving. With the story's help, you'll have to solve puzzles that are integrated in the environment in order to reach the end of this adventure.
You can take all the time you want to explore and solve the puzzles. No one will come bother you here. The puzzles are neither too hard nor too easy, just like the length of the adventure is neither too long nor too short. Everything has been balanced to provide a relaxing experience and pleasant time spent in an imaginary world.
FEATURES Intuitive puzzles
The puzzles that you will encounter in Haven Moon are completely integrated into the environment and in perfect harmony with the story. They have been designed with great care to give a natural and intuitive user experience.
Very simple and intuitive interface
The game has been made to be accessible to all kinds of players. The interface and controls have been carefully designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible, featuring a mouse-only gameplay: the entire game uses mouse navigation. Move it to look around, left-click to move forward and interact, and right-click to move backwards. That's it!
(For those who prefer WASD style controls, it's still possible to configure keyboard controls from the input menu although this is contrary to the game design).
High quality graphics
Haven Moon features high quality 3D real-time graphics, offering complete freedom of movement in a detailed and realistic environment.
(A "light" option can be used to play the game smoothly on computers running on minimum system requirements).
High quality original soundtrack
To bring a fascinating mood and beautiful emotions to the game, Hollywood composer Leo J. Russlan exclusively composed a wonderful orchestral cinematic music for Haven Moon, making the experience even more captivating.
A game for everyone
Haven Moon is a tranquil game dedicated to contemplation and reflective thinking. It's a calm and solitary place where you hear the sounds of the sea, the wind and the beautiful music. You have all the time you want to explore and solve the various puzzles. 20 YEARS IN THE MAKING It took me more than 20 years to create this game. From the first time I played Myst sometime between 1994 -1995, when I was a teenager, recreating the same experience has become an obsession. During all these years, I have tried many times to build my own Myst-like game, but it's only 3 years ago that everything coincided to make Haven Moon possible.
This project represents not only 3 years of real hard work, but also a huge part of my life. The journey leading to the release of this game was incredible.
I absolutely loved working on Haven Moon and I was very lucky it turned out exactly the way I had imagined it. So now I really hope that you will have as much pleasure playing it as I had creating it.

A loaded handgun found in the parking lot of East High School on Monday belongs to a former city councilman, reports said.
City police working school security were called to the school at 474 Bennington Ave. about 8:25 a.m., where a woman gave them a case that had a loaded .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun inside that she found next to a car in the parking lot. Police said the car belongs to former 2nd Ward Councilman Rufus Hudson, who is a substitute teacher at the school.
Reports said Hudson told officers the gun was his, and it must have fallen out of his car. The gun was taken by police, reports said, pending the results of an investigation.
William Morvay, head of security for the school district, said it is against Ohio law and school board policy to take a gun on school property, even if the person has a permit or keeps it locked in a vehicle.
The offense is a fifth-degree felony in the Ohio Revised Code and carries a penalty of six months to a year in jail. Hudson had not been charged as of Tuesday afternoon.
A message was left for Hudson seeking comment.
District spokeswoman Yvonne Mathis said there is an investigation. School Human Resources Director Karen Green said Hudson will not be allowed to teach in the district until the investigation is complete.
Hudson has a concealed- weapon permit through the Mahoning County Sheriff's Office, according to information provided by the sheriff's office.
Hudson served two terms on council from 1999-2007.
Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, has called the $400 price tag for PlayStation VR a figure "right around what [was] expected."
Speaking to GameSpot in an interview at the Game Developer's Conference, Luckey said, "I know how much this technology costs. We're building a headset, we're trying to sell it as affordably as possible. We have some higher quality stuff, our manufactured stuff, and we have some really nice soft goods and fabric going on in ours. We also have multiple LED displays instead of just one display. But [the Oculus Rift] at $599 is actually not that far off. We're selling $599 with a controller, and with the remote, and with a couple of games. If someone doesn't own them already, [Sony] is selling a camera, a controller, and you've got the headset—we're actually fairly similar in cost. They are cheaper, but I think it's a totally fair price and they've definitely done a good job of keeping the cost down. Clearly that was a priority."
By comparison, the Oculus Rift headset will go on sale this month for $600 and will require a PC powerful enough to run the technology. Those thinking of picking up a Rift should check that their machine meets the minimum system requirements.
In comparing Oculus Rift to PlayStation VR, Luckey said, "I think [the markets] are almost completely different. People who buy a Rift are people who already own a high-end PC or are willing to buy a high-end PC for VR. People who buy a PlayStation VR are people who already own a PlayStation, or PlayStation VR is something that convinces them to buy a PlayStation that they probably already wanted for other reasons, not VR reasons. I don't think there are many PC gamers that are going to buy a PlayStation and PlayStation VR from scratch. And I don't think there are many PlayStation gamers that are going to buy a Rift and a high-end PC. They're kind of very separate markets at this point."
Sony revealed pricing details and release date for the PlayStation VR at the Game Developer's Conference earlier today. The device will cost $400 in the United States, €399 in Europe, £349 in the United Kingdom, $549.95 in Australia, and ¥44,980 in Japan. This price will get you the headset, a Wii-sized processor unit and a series of cables, including HDMI and USB, among others. A PS4 camera, which is required for the headset to run properly, will not be included in the package.

In the last year, the budget overruns of just four city projects, or run-ups over original estimates, have totaled more than $200 million. That's quadruple the city's yearly budget to fight homelessness, about $70 million more than the city's previous housing levy and just shy of the total cost to launch universal preschool citywide.
There's the seawall, now $70 million over its former budget (which, by the way, was already $30 million over its first budget). There's the new customer information system (NCIS) for Seattle Public Utilities and City Light, $34 million over its original cost. There's the new North Precinct police station, $60 million more expensive than the original estimate of $88 million. And there's the Denny substation, now $209 million, up from $173 million the year before.
And with every one of them came the same reaction on the second floor of City Hall, where the Seattle City Council resides: Surprise. That's not exactly the reaction you want from elected officials. And they agree.
“As one of the new councilmembers, I was surprised that we lack the tools to effectively govern,” says Seattle Councilmember Rob Johnson. “More often than not we were being asked to approve the resources of projects that were already under way.”
On this issue, Councilmember Tim Burgess says, "I'm not going to point fingers at anybody, except maybe ourselves.”
In response, the council, led by Councilmembers Johnson and Lisa Herbold, will take a stab at creating a sturdier mechanism for reviewing the city's capital projects — its large-scale infrastructure items — by this fall. They will be following the lead of government bodies near and far, who have better wrangled this issue.
Revelations around cost overruns have the feeling of coming out of nowhere, as if one morning the seawall ran into a $70 million mistake. But the reality is these overruns percolate, either through error (soil conditions along the waterfront, said SDOT, were much more challenging than they'd anticipated) or expanded scope (see the new North Precinct station's proposed yoga studio, not part of the original plans).
The seawall's issues arose last summer, when SDOT Director Scott Kubly came to the council, adamant he'd only just learned of the massive overruns. In this sort of instances, the question becomes how much should the council keep tabs on the technical, day-to-day operations of a project.
The North Precinct station, NCIS and the Denny substation, on the other hand, all proceeded smoothly through budget approvals, with hardly a peep from the dais. The proposed 2015 capital improvement projects listed the North Precinct at $88 million and the substation at $173 million. The council gave their blessings, only reopening concerns months later. The substation has still received little attention.
Then, last fall, those same items showed up at $160 million and $209 million respectively. Additionally, there was a clear note that “delay in [NCIS] will increase costs in 2016,” although it didn't mention by how much. Again, the council gave its blessing, including Councilmember Mike O'Brien, who recently voted against a resolution in support of the station.
The fact is that the docket of capital improvement projects is so vast and dense (this year's clocked in at a cool 879 pages) that the council often misses big ticket items. “While we try to do a good job doing oversight of capital projects, we don't do enough,” says Councilmember Burgess.
The life of a capital project is a vague and complicated one, marked by recessions, elections and retirements. Take the North Precinct station. Officials first brought it up in 1998, but starts and stops in the economy essentially shelved it for what ended up being decades. It picked up again in 2012 as the design process got rolling.
In a council committee meeting last June, city budget director Ben Noble told council that the $88 million was just a guess, and a poor one at that.
“We were left to the best of our abilities to come up with a number,” he said. “We knew it wasn't right; we didn't know how wrong it was. It was not a constructive estimate…to establish what's a reasonable cost for a project like this…. It's not that we migrated from $90 to $160 (million). It's that we never had the right number to begin with.”
Not surprisingly, that methodology was not met well by council. Right or wrong, the number made it into the budget without the context that it was seen as wrong by the people proposing it. Design plans moved forward, at a cost of millions of dollars, on the assumption that the total cost would be $88 million.
Meanwhile, the commission tasked with overseeing the design cheered its way toward bigger and better additions, including the yoga studio and a skatepark. The comments of this commission are a stark contrast to the more recent protests, praising the location, encouraging it to look beautiful and to contain extensive common space.
Last November, the cost was suddenly up to $160 million.
Once upon time, says longtime City Hall dweller Herbold, the council would get a reading of capital projects. But because there were so many, they mostly flew by without analysis or context. “The feeling, even then, was it was too much information to allow for a meaningful review,” she says.
So although cost overruns feel like they've recently run rampant, Seattle has actually never been very good at communicating on this front.
Recently, the council commissioned a study of other jurisdictions and how they deal with this problem. In Fresno, an oversight board reviews every project over $20 million. In Los Angeles, they have special oversight committees for transportation, IT, seismic retrofits, and zoo capital programs. And in San Diego, there's a council infrastructure committee.
Even just down the road, at the King County Council, two full time staff members oversee large capital projects. Johnson likes the Sound Transit approach, where large projects go through gates as they pass certain milestones.
Whether the council would establish an oversight committee or maybe lean on civilian commissions is unclear, but the challenge will be picking and choosing which projects deserve the most scrutiny. 800 pages of capital improvement is a lot.
But so is $200 million.
Bethlehem – Ma'an – Israeli soldiers seized a nonviolent activist on Sunday during a dawn raid on the West Bank village of Bil'in, which holds a weekly demonstration against the Israeli separation wall.
According to Eyad Burnat of Bil'in's Popular Committee Against the Wall, Israeli soldiers raided the home of another committeemember, Emad Burnat at 5:30am, arresting him and taking him inside a military jeep. When Palestinian and international activists attempted to block the vehicles path, the Israeli troops used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse them. The jeep and three others left the village under a hail of rocks thrown by Palestinians.
The soldiers also raided the house Abd Al-Fatah Burnat without making any arrests. Local activists videotaped the incursion.
Emad Burnat is currently receiving medical treatment after a recent tractor accident.
Bil'in villagers and international supporters have demonstrated against the Israeli separation barrier every Friday for over four years. The under-construction wall separates the village from about 60% of its land.
According to the Popular Committee, the Israeli army has seized 17 people from the village over the past three weeks.
Medical workers demonstrate their training for working with possible Ebola patients — the kind of work often carried out by infectious disease specialists.
Infectious diseases medicine is crucially important to the future of worldwide health, but there are growing indications that the field has reason to worry about its own future.
Would-be medical specialists across the United States were matched with specialty training programs earlier this month as part of an annual ritual known as fellowship “match” day. Of 335 infectious diseases fellowships up for grabs, 117 were not filled, according to the National Resident Matching Program. A number of the unclaimed placements were at some of the country's most prestigious medical schools.
By way of comparison, all 374 clinical gastroenterology fellowships were filled.

“It was an historic bad,” Dr. Wendy Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said of this year's match, which comes on the heels of several years of bad matches.
“We are all concerned,” said Armstrong, who teaches infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. “In the specialty, this is a significant topic of conversation. We are concerned that this could become a crisis.”
The match, as it is known, is a process that helps medical schools fill more than 8,500 fellowships in 50 specialties ranging from pediatric surgery to geriatrics, from cardiology to oncology. There is another match, the results of which are announced every March, that places graduating doctors into residency positions in hospitals — the last part of their general medical training. Both are run by the nonprofit National Resident Matching Program.
In some specialty areas, every available fellowship position is typically spoken for — as was the case this year for fields including oncology and hematology. For other fields, the percentage of filled positions reaches near 100 percent.
For infectious diseases programs, however, the results are much less auspicious. Only 65 percent of the available fellowships were allocated during the 2016 match, Mona Signer, president and CEO of the National Resident Matching Program, said in an email.
Dr. Dan Diekema, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Iowa Medical College, has likened what's happening to his specialty to “a dumpster fire” — a complete disaster no one wants to address.
“The number of [infectious diseases] programs that did not fill on Match Day is really steadily rising in a pretty rapid way,” Diekema told STAT. “The trend that's undeniable is that fewer and fewer people are interested in going into infectious diseases.”
Interest may be waning, but the need for these specialists may actually be on the rise. This, after all, is the field that trains doctors to deal with problems like antibiotic resistance, a looming global crisis. This is the specialty that manages disease outbreaks; its practitioners help hospitals prepare to safely treat Ebola patients and manage that care if such patients arrive. These are the programs that train the future staff of public health departments. These fellowships create the future HIV specialists.
The recruitment problem has drawn the attention of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Armstrong, who chairs the society's training program directors committee and recruitment task force, said the group is exploring ways to attract more fellows. But it is also trying to determine whether there are simply more fellowship positions than the specialty can support, she said.
She and others say a number of factors are contributing to the problem. In the end, much of it appears to come down to money.
Infectious diseases are sometimes called one of medicine's “thinking” specialties. Its practitioners often spend hours trying to optimize prudent in-hospital use of antibiotics as part of antibiotic stewardship programs. Or they may, like TV's Dr. House, puzzle out the source of infections plaguing patients in an intensive care unit.
Other specialities devote more time to conducting procedures or performing surgeries. In a system that typically compensates for tasks completed, doing is a more lucrative endeavor than thinking.
Diekema pointed to a related issue: the rise of hospitalists.
Hospitalists are doctors who do not split their time between private practice and hospital care; they work exclusively in a hospital. Doctors can take a job as a hospitalist after completing their general residency, skipping the extra two or three years of study needed to specialize. “When you have a student debt weighing on you, that suddenly makes that career path much more attractive than continuing to make $50,000 a year as a fellow. You can make $250,000 as a hospitalist,” Diekema said.
If that weren't attractive enough, there's this: Infectious diseases specialists earn less than hospitalists, even though they have the extra years of training. Diekema said hospitalists have persuaded hospital management teams that they save institutions money by reducing the amount of time patients spend in hospitals and lowering readmission rates. The same claim could be made about the work of infectious disease doctors but “infectious diseases as a specialty has not made that argument strongly enough,” Diekema said.
This matters because infectious diseases programs are often competing for recruits with hospitalist programs, Diekema suggested. In other words, the people who are attracted to infectious diseases — physicians who like complex cases — are also the people who make good hospitalists.
Some of the infectious diseases fellowships that weren't filled on match day will eventually be claimed. Some would-be infectious diseases fellows now sit out the match, knowing good programs will be scrambling to fill spots after the match.
Although he understands the compensation problems, Diekema is puzzled more new doctors don't want to go into his field. “It's a fascinating and rewarding career. I would choose it again in a second.”

Housing, Tech, and Inequality in San Francisco: A Way Forward
I'm sitting in a Philz coffee in San Francisco on Folsom and 24th street, the heart of the Mission District. A hodgepodge of tables, chairs, and sofas of different sizes, walls painted with pictures of trees, various portraits of the founder, Phil, baristas who are as hip as they come, the calming slogan of “one cup at a time,” and of course the luscious aroma of fresh coffee – quintessential San Francisco. It's a Thursday morning, and I was able to walk right up to the counter and order a delicious cup of their Aromatic Arabic and a breakfast sandwich. Coming in on a Saturday or Sunday would have been a different story, though, when it's typical for there to be a line stretching out the door of people who are mostly young, mostly hoodied, and mostly working in some way or another in the tech industry.
The weekend line of 20-somethings dressed in startup logo apparel habitually checking their smartphones illustrate a truth about contemporary San Francisco – that the city has grown into what most would consider the tech capital of the world. Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and a host of other technology firms, both giant and start-up, all have their headquarters in the Bay Area, if not within the city itself. San Francisco has become the envy of other metros, playing host to an industry that is constantly growing, and correspondingly possessing one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country at 5.3%.
At the same time, with the influx of highly paid tech workers, San Francisco has become one of the the least affordable cities to live in. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $3,250, and the median home price as of November was $880,700 (at one point in 2013 it topped $1 million).
San Francisco's widespread rent control policies provide a bit of a shield, limiting the annual rise in prices for continuing tenants to 60% of the local inflation rate. However, the Ellis Act, a law on the California books that allows a landlord to evict tenants in order to get out of the residential rental market, has caused a public furor. With the astronomically high market-value properties, many building owners have decided to cash in – Ellis Act evictions and tenant buy-outs tripled since the beginning of 2013 (see this interactive map of evictions). In September, the eviction of an elderly Chinese couple and their disabled daughter who had lived in their apartment since the ‘70s brought this subject direct to the fore.
This issue has put SF mayor Ed Lee in the hot seat. At his State of the City speech a year ago, he only gave token acknowledgement to the housing problem, emphasizing instead the thriving tech industry. But what was front and center this time around – you guessed it, housing.
And rightfully so, as resentment about the staggering cost of living in the city has resulted in flares of protest, much of which directed at the tech community. The symbol of the influx of tech, the luxury buses that transport nearly 20,000 employees from the city down to the headquarters of various companies in the Peninsula area, have lately received their fair share of piñata whacking (literally). In late December, Google and Apple buses were barricaded by protesters angry about rising evictions. Activists again targeted buses earlier this week, the same day as a Municipal Transit Agency hearing which resulted in officials agreeing to charge corporate buses a fee of $1 per day per stop. High profile actions by prominent tech leaders haven't helped with the industry's image problem, either – see Greg Gopman of AngelHack's sickeningly elitist comments about the homeless in San Francisco (soon after which an apology was issued).
So in the city hailed as the tech capital of the world, we now see a major backlash. Many view the tech industry as the spearhead of growing inequality, and as a new generation of young, highly paid tech workers flock to San Francisco, the long term residents find themselves increasingly estranged in their own home.
San Francisco clearly needs to tackle its housing problem head on. Last Friday, Mayor Lee announced an ambitious goal of increasing production of new housing units in the city by 5,000 every year for the next six years, a large percentage of which to be reserved for middle and lower income families. But even this is essentially a symptom level cure, and it was pretty slow to come. There's a larger, more systemic problem if it takes a tripling of evictions and a series of forceful protests against the very industry that is propelling San Francisco's growth to get elected leaders to act. Why didn't they take a more proactive approach when it was so painfully obvious to those on the ground level that something was wrong?
The bigger problem has to do with the fact that our local, state, and federal governments operate not much differently from your standard vending machine. Yes, vending machine. This metaphor has been made by more than one thinker, but Tim O'Reily, founder and CEO of O'Reily Media and Web 2.0 guru, explains the analogy well:
Too often, we think of government as a kind of vending machine. We put in our taxes, and get out services: roads, bridges, hospitals, fire brigades, police protection… And when the vending machine doesn't give us what we want, we protest. Our idea of citizen engagement has somehow been reduced to shaking the vending machine.
So while our individual lives and the operations of private industry have been revolutionized by technology, the way our government works, and the way we work with government, has remained mostly static. What is romanticized in our high school civics classes as a way for different members of the community to collectively resolve their differences, through voting and representation, has turned into an automated and thoroughly insulated bureaucratic entity. Instead, government – according to O'Reily – aught to behave more as a platform that enables genuine and purposeful civic engagement rather than an opaque mechanism that takes your money and sometimes gives you what you want.
Yet even this doesn't go far enough, because we cannot and should not rely on the government to always play referee. Yes the government can take steps to foster civic engagement, but so can everyday citizens. And this is really the crux of the issue. Rather than having the polarized representatives of each faction put pressure on the government to pursue their interests, i.e. who can shake the vending machine harder, we should work together to create a San Francisco that can work for everyone.
To be fair, the city of San Francisco has already made strides toward this goal of acting more as a platform. By opening up troves of data for public access, the city allows for developers to create mobile apps that assist people in everything from mapping crime, to finding a good place to eat, to identifying trees in their neighborhoods.
The city has also experimented with websites that allow for crowdsourcing of solutions to public problems. Unfortunately, many of these suffer from being overly top-down and precautionary in their approach, sabotaging the inherent openness of what can and should be discussed in the interests of political truancy. The ImproveSF website, a civic portal created in partnership with the Mayor's office, doesn't even have a topic on housing – really? Thus even if the city has made progress towards this shift, let's be honest, nothing will change without the bottom-up efforts of regular people, putting forth the genuine effort to tackle an issue that they all have a vested interest in.
So what does bottom up engagement look like? Take a look at this: In 2009, severe flooding in Kauai took out one of the main access points to the Polihale State Park. The cost of repairing the road was put at $4 million, money that the state Department of Land and Natural Resources didn't have, therefore there was little alternative but for the park to close down indefinitely. This would have been the death knell for many local businesses who rely on tourism dollars from park visitors, therefore local entrepreneurs and residents pooled their resources to repair the bridge themselves. It took a mere eight days, says Troy Martin, a business owner who donated machinery and steel:
We shouldn't have to do this, but when it gets to a state level, it just gets so bureaucratic, something that took us eight days would have taken them years. So we got together — the community — and we got it done.
This is the kind of response that needs to happen here. Having both sides vilify one another through various media channels and outlets accomplishes nothing, and instead seeds more division, putting any reasonable compromise further from reach. The individuals who work in the tech industry aren't inherently evil and plutocratic, they just want to work and be a part of this amazing city the way others have for generations (an even greater number probably just want to get to work on time). However, they too need to realize that despite their good intentions on an individual level, the systemic pressures that they collectively create are having an adverse effect on the people who already live here, and they need to be willing to admit this, as well as work towards addressing it. Imagine the impact a civil and collaborative approach might have in fostering a stronger feeling of empowerment and community amongst all people. My guess is that the housing problem, which has been present in people's minds for years, would have been addressed much sooner and with a myriad of creative solutions arising from a wide range of sources. I don't know what the solution to San Francisco's housing problem is, but I'm sure there is someone who does.
Wrapping up working at Philz I struck up a conversation with a fellow coffee sipper. Talking about what drew her to the city, she mentioned the infectiously optimistic, can-do attitude of so many people here. San Franciscans, she said, dive into problems with relish, confident in their ability to leverage resources available to them and find solutions. As the city addresses housing, inequality more generally, and a host of other (seemingly) daunting problems, the time has come to unleash this collective ingenuity towards solving common challenges. After all, arguably no other city is as poised to leverage the power of citizens 2.0 and, if done properly, the engine that has fueled San Francisco's dramatic growth also has the power to both broaden prosperity beyond just a select group of techies, and ensure this incredible city's vibrancy and richness for generations to come.
Again, I am no expert on housing, but I can contribute by offering something of a starting point. Share your thoughts on how to address San Francisco's housing crisis here.

Buy Photo Two women were assaulted in Fort Collins early Sunday and Monday, police said. (Photo: Morgan Spiehs/Coloradoan library)Buy Photo
Fort Collins police are investigating weekend assaults that left two women injured at their apartment complexes.
A suspect has not been identified in the separate attacks that happened at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday and Monday, Sgt. Dean Cunningham said. It's not clear if the attacks are related, though police said the cases share similarities.
Both women were attacked by unknown assailants after returning to their apartment complexes late at night. In both cases, the women were able to evade their attacker and call police.
Early Sunday morning, a woman was attacked on the 1900 block of West Plum Street. The next day, another woman was assaulted on the 1200 block of East Lincoln Avenue, Cunningham said.
Both women were taken to area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries after the assaults. There identities and conditions weren't immediately available Monday afternoon. Police also didn't disclose information about suspect descriptions.
“We're still working with victims and we're not at a point where we can release suspect information yet,” Cunningham said. It's unclear what the assailant or assailants' motives were.
Police on Monday reminded the community to be vigilant in the wake of the assaults.
“Very little information is known as yet that will lead police to the identification of the suspect or suspects,” the release said. Members of the public are reminded to take the precautions in order to remain safe:
•Travel with company late at night.
•Travel in well-lit areas when possible.
•If being dropped off by a friend or taxi, ask the driver to take you within sight of your door and remain on scene until you are safely inside.
•Be vigilant. Know your surroundings.
•Report any suspicious persons or activity to police without delay.
•Keep doors and windows secured.
Anyone with information about the assaults is asked to call Sgt. Kristy Volesky at 970-224-6020 or Crime Stoppers of Larimer County at 970-221-6868. Crime Stoppers may also be reach at stopcriminals.org.

Spoilers for last night's Community coming up:
You knew that “Advanced Dungeons & Dragons” was going to be a special episode of Community, because it was structurally different (as many of its best episodes are), because it had a stripped-down (and thus budget-saving) setting and because, well, most of the episode involved a single game of Dungeons & Dragons. But none of those in the end were the reason that it was such a good episode: it was such a good episode because Community has become a strong enough and well-enough defined show that the best and funniest things its characters can do is simply talk to one another.
The driving plot of “AD&D” was not especially spectacular; there needed to be a reason for the game to play out, and it made more sense for that reason to come from a character external to the study group. (And it was probably a weak spot to ground an episode about stereotyping and bullying in a stereotype itself—namely, that the roleplaying aficionado is a lifelong fat kid driven to it as an escape from being an outcast.) Once the game began, focused by the disruptive character of Pierce, the episode became a showcase for how well Community knows its characters, so that they seemed natural and recognizable even when stepping into “characters” they were creating for themselves.
This was essentially the idea beyond “Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas” too, but in a way “AD&D” worked even better for me, despite, or because of, its absence of visual pyrotechnics. Staging-wise, it was little more than a table read; like a game of D&D itself, it played out on a mental stage. In fact, I'd argue that doing this episode with animation or other visual aids would have weakened it—the exception being Chang's Drow Elf makeup, which worked because it was a horrible, hilarious exception.
Instead, it was the central group of characters playing characters but being themselves: Britta moralizing (with a touch of Hermione Granger's house-elf liberation campaign), Abed dispassionately stage-managing, Jeff feverishly arguing and conniving to save Fat Neil's sense of self-worth (and thus, we learned, redeem himself for coining “Fat Neil”). That their interactions and arguments took place in a context of spell-casting dragons, amulets and cloaks of windwalking made it hilarious, but didn't make D&D experience necessary.
The one problem I had in all these character dynamics was with Pierce, who was obliviously selfish, cruel and petty in a way that would have exactly fit Eric Cartman in a D&D-themed episode of South Park. Now, you can have Cartman on South Park: it's a certain show with a certain level of character reality and rules of relations. But Community is a show where, for all its weirdness, the character's relationships follow recognizable rules of psychological realism. If someone likes or annoys someone else, there's a reason. With Pierce, though—whatever gestures the show has made toward explaining him—there's less and less reason to explain why he's still in the study group other than that, well, Chevy Chase is in the cast.
Beyond that, though, the episode was so nimble, well-constructed and just funny that, for me, it made its saving throw. Quick hail of bullets:
* Has there been a D&D episode of South Park? I don't recall one—though I remember the excellent WoW episode—but it feels somehow like there should have been one.
* I have to admit that at first, having Jeff of all people be the one to volunteer to do a good deed for Fat Neil seemed entirely out of character, so it was a very nice twist to reveal his motivations, which suddenly made his behavior entirely in character.
* I have sometimes criticized Community for relying too much on “This is just like a movie where…” references, so credit where due: this was an episode that could easily have loaded up on easy LOTR and other references, but didn't, and was probably funnier for it.
* Yesterday I posted a clip from that other great TV episode about D&D, Freaks and Geeks' “Discos and Dragons,” while noting that it's an unfair comparison. But one place where the comparison is direct, and flattering to both shows, is: Community, like F&G, really captured the sense of what it's like to sit down and talk through a role-playing game with friends, without getting into the weeds of arcana and rules. (It also captured effectively what the experience is like for a new group of players, as opposed to, say, the online series The Guild.)
* I will never forget hearing Annie describe that imaginary interspecies sexual encounter that we did not actually get to hear her describe.
* Tail, right? Yes, of course tail. Forget I even asked.
As a presence in the worlda body hanging from a subway strap or pressed into an elevator, a figure crossing the streetI am neither markedly masculine nor notably effeminate. Nor am I typically perceived as androgynous, not in my uniform of Diesels and boots, not even when I was younger and favored dangling earrings and bright Jack Purcells. But most people immediately read me (correctly) as gay. It takes only a glance to make my truth obvious. I know this from strangers who find gay people offensive enough to elicit a remarkcatcalls from cab windows, to use a recent exampleas well as from countless casual social engagements in which people easily assume my orientation, no sensitive gaydar necessary. I'm not so much out-of-the-closet as self-evident, to use Quentin Crisp's phrase, although being of a younger generation, I can't subscribe to his belief that it is a kind of disfigurement requiring lavender hair rinse.
I once placed a personal ad in which I described myself as gay-acting/gay-appearing, partly as a jab at my peers who prefer to be thought of as str8 but mostly because it's just who I am. Maybe a better way to phrase it would have been third-sexer, the category advanced by the gay German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld 100 years ago. The label fell into disrepute, but lately a number of well-known researchers in the field of sexual orientation have been reviving it based on an extensive new body of research showing that most of us, whether top or bottom, butch or femme, or somewhere in between, share a kind of physical otherness that locates us in our own quadrant of the gender matrix, more like one another than not. Whatever that otherness is seems to come from somewhere deep within us. It mostly defies our efforts to disguise it. That's what we mean by gaydarnot the skill of the viewer so much as the telltale signs most gay people project, the set of traits that make us unmistakably one.
The late psychologist and sexologist John Money famously called these the details of our gendermaps, which he believed are drawn primarily by life's experience and social conditioning. Money planted some of the earliest flags in the nature-versus-nurture war by claiming that dysfunctional parents, not inborn biology, is what produced sissy boys, tomboys, and other gender variants. But today, the pendulum has swung just about as far in the other direction as possible. A small constellation of researchers is specifically analyzing the traits and characteristics that, though more pronounced in some than in others, not only make us gay but also make us appear gay.
At first read, their findings seem like a string of unlinked, esoteric observations. Statistically, for instance, gay men and lesbians have about a 50 percent greater chance of being left-handed or ambidextrous than straight men or women. The relative lengths of our fingers offer another hint: The index fingers of most straight men are shorter than their ring fingers, while for most women they are closer in length, or even reversed in ratio. But some researchers have noted that gay men are likely to have finger-length ratios more in line with those of straight women, and a study of self-described butch lesbians showed significantly masculinized ratios. The same goes for the way we hear, the way we process spatial reasoning, and even the ring of our voices. One study, involving tape-recordings of gay and straight men, found that 75 percent of gay men sounded gay to a general audience. It's unclear what the listeners responded to, whether there is a recognized gay accent or vocal quality. And there is no hint as to whether this idiosyncrasy is owed to biology or cultural influencesonly that it's unmistakable. What is there in Rufus Wainwright's uninhibited, yearning, ugly-duckling voice, as the Los Angeles Times wrote a few weeks ago, that we recognize as uniquely gay? Does biology account for Rosie O'Donnell's crisp trumpet and Charles Nelson Reilly's gnyuck-gnyuck-gnyuck?
These are all part and parcel of the idea that being gay is differentthat we are different animals to some extent, says Simon LeVay, the British-born neuroscientist who has dedicated himself to studying these issues. Hirschfeld was right. I support the idea that we're a third sexor a third sex and a fourth sex, gay men and lesbians. Today, there's scientific documentation behind this.
Richard Lippa, a psychologist from California State University at Fullerton, is one of the leading cataloguers of the many ways in which gay people are different. I caught up with him a few weeks ago at a booth at the Long Beach Pride Festival in Southern California, where he was researching another hypothesisthat the hair-whorl patterns on gay heads are more likely to go counterclockwise. If true, it will be one more clue to our biological uniqueness.
The City of Ottawa will have to pay more than $2 million in damages for a 2008 crash in which an OC Transpo bus T-boned an SUV, killing three people.
The SUV driver, Mark MacDonald, had been drinking and ran a red light, which led Judge Giovanna Toscano Roccamo to find him 80-per-cent responsible for the crash.
But he and two of his friends, 19-year-olds Brianne Deschamps and Vanessa Crawford, were killed and MacDonald's drinking largely invalidated his insurance policy.
Two other passengers, Ben Gardiner, then 20, and Monica Neacsu, then 19, were injured.
After the collision, Neacsu told the Citizen that the five friends had gone to the Carleton University graduate student bar, Mike's Place, for karaoke, then to Grace O'Malley's on Merivale Road.
Gardiner and his family sued the city, four pubs and MacDonald's estate. Deschamps' family also sued.
Because of how the law works in Ontario, if you're partially responsible for damages, you can be forced to pay the full amount if all the other responsible parties are unable to pay anything. Toscano Roccamo found the city 20-per-cent responsible because the bus was going 66.5 km/h in a 60 zone and the bus driver had “a moment of inattention.”
Cities in Ontario have complained about this for years because they're often held responsible in cases like this, paying millions in damages when others are mostly at fault.
Toxicology reports confirmed that MacDonald, 20, had been drinking that night. Witnesses reported seeing an SUV travelling southbound on Bank Street, running red lights and driving erratically, before colliding with a bus at the intersection of Heron Road and Riverside Drive just before 2 a.m.
The nine-day trial heard evidence from numerous witnesses, including three experts in accident reconstruction.
Reconstruction of the accident was slightly hampered by a number of factors, most notably the lack of evidence as to the exact point of impact.
The city will be required to pay approximately $2.1 million in damages awarded in the Gardiner case and $200,000 awarded in the Deschamps case due to the application of a principle known as joint and several liabilities.
While most automobile insurance policies in Ontario provide for $1 million in third-party liability coverage, the insurance for the SUV was reduced to $200,000 because MacDonald had a blood-alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit for a fully licensed driver. This was contrary to the requirements of his G2 licence, which prohibit driving after the consumption of any alcohol.
The bus driver, Raymond Richer, had been driving buses for approximately 27 years at the time of the crash.
The judge didn't find his testimony credible or reliable, and noted that he didn't fare well under cross-examination with respect to the data recorded by the GPS equipment on the bus, which showed he had been speeding at earlier points in the night by as much as 20 km/h over the limit.
Richer challenged the GPS-recorded data as “hokus pokus.”
The judge also found he didn't adjust his speed to account for weather and road conditions, which were snowy and slushy, and that he looked away briefly, checking his mirrors, when he reached the intersection.
The city's legal department will consult with outside lawyers and its liability insurer to review the court decision and consider whether to appeal it, city solicitor Rick O'Connor told councillors in a memo Friday.

Syfy won't be ordering another season of thriller “Incorporated,” Variety has confirmed.
The news comes a little more than a month after “Incorporated” finished its first season on the NBCU cable network. Deadline first reported the cancelation.
“Incorporated” came from executive producers Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Todd, with “The Good Wife” scribe Ted Humphrey as showrunner, and was a hot commodity when brought to the marketplace. The show was created by David and Alex Pastor, who wrote and directed the pilot; Damon and Affleck's Pearl Street Films produced along with CBS Television Studios and Syfy's sister studio Universal Cable Productions.
Set in a future where corporations have unlimited power, “Incorporated” revolved around Ben Larson (Sean Teale, “Reign”), a young executive who concealed his true identity to infiltrate a very dangerous corporate world to save the woman he loves and quickly found he wasn't the only one in this world with a secret. Dennis Haysbert, who just booked a lead role in NBC's pilot “Reverie,” also starred, along with Julia Ormond and Eddie Ramos.
The series debuted to mostly positive reviews. “‘Incorporated‘ is an energetic and watchable science-fiction thriller that posits that a climate apocalypse will be followed by a swift division of survivors into haves and have-nots — all by the year 2074,” Variety‘s Maureen Ryan wrote. “Right now, that date feels like a somewhat optimistic estimate.”
Yet the show didn't exactly pop in the ratings, averaging a Live+Same Day audience of just under 500,000 and a 0.16 in the 18-49 demographic, with delayed viewing not quite doubling those base numbers.
Coming off his near-upset in the Iowa caucus and his massive win in New Hampshire, polls (PDF) are showing that more voters nationally are “feeling the Bern,” with Bernie Sanders now appearing to have the momentum against Hillary Clinton. These polls seem to confirm two theories.
First, the enthusiasm gap that many of us have long written about and that Hillary Clinton struggles with is very real.
Second, not caring about which candidate is actually electable might be one of the greatest forms of privilege there is. This is one reason why despite being more progressive than Clinton in some areas, Sanders has struggled to gain traction with black voters. Because ignoring whether a candidate is actually electable is a luxury most minorities simply can't afford.
Here's what I mean.
Every voter I've ever met has fallen into three camps: Those who see voting as a civic duty, those who only do it when they're really inspired, and those who view it as an act of survival. For those who view it as a civic duty, voting is on par with volunteering for charity—something good, responsible people do regularly but not necessarily something they believe will immediately impact their lives. But they may believe that voting for a candidate who cares about climate change today could possibly have some impact on the world one day, like when their grandchildren are here.
We have all met at least one person who falls in the only when they're really “inspired” camp. They only vote when a candidate makes their heart sing by saying something witty on The Tonight Show or giving one great speech.
Then there are those who vote for survival. That's the person who votes, and gets family members to vote, to try to overturn a Stand Your Ground Law in her state, because she knows more than one unarmed teen in her community who was killed because of such a law. That kind of voter doesn't have the luxury of waiting to be “inspired” by a candidate or to think long term about how their vote might make a difference a decade from now.
Which is why the battle between Bernie and Hillary is actually much bigger than the two of them. It's a larger debate the progressive movement has struggled to settle within its broad coalition for years over whether considering electability is in itself a moral issue on par with the many policy issues voters and parties must consider.
For years there was a saying in Democratic circles: “Democrats want to fall in love with a candidate. Republicans fall in line.” (Obviously Donald Trump's supporters didn't get the memo this year.)
Hillary Clinton continues to struggle because she's not a candidate who inspires love; admiration perhaps, but not love. The crowds at Bernie Sanders rallies could easily be mistaken for those attending a mega-church tent revival—all smiles, music and enthusiasm out the yin-yang. Hillary Clinton's events by comparison have the more sobering feel of the Sunday School class your mom made you go to. But that doesn't change the fact that beyond his core loyalists Bernie Sanders is not widely seen as presidential material. Yet watching Bernie Sanders gain momentum and be enthusiastically celebrated by the same people ridiculing Trump's supporters as delusional has been a combination of ironic and baffling.
For starters, Sanders is a self-described socialist and a recent Gallup poll found that socialists are even less electable than atheists these days, which is saying something.
And in a poll released recently by Monmouth University a plurality of Democrats declared Clinton the Democratic candidate with the best chance of beating the Republican frontrunners, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
But details like these have not deterred Sanders loyalists. This is not exactly surprising because we have seen this before. I mean that Sanders inspires the same measure of devotion shown to previous progressive icons like Ralph Nader, who played the role of spoiler to Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Nader's and Sanders's supporters have a few things in common.
For starters, few of Nader's supporters actually looked at him and thought, “I genuinely believe this man has a serious shot of making it all the way to the White House.” But it wasn't actually about winning. Instead Nader supporters had a whole host of reasons why they were willing to cast a vote that would help insure a Bush victory. Reasons like:
“We need his voice!”
“The system is broken and we need to send a message!”
“I'd rather vote my conscience than vote for the winner!”
“All I care about is who is right on the issues!” (i.e. which candidate most aligns with me ideologically)
Of course the message they ended up sending with their vote of conscience was ultimately, “I'm fine helping elect Bush.”
The similarities don't end there. According to polling research Sanders supporters are primarily white, and they have higher levels of education and income than Clinton supporters. In 2000 The Washington Post described Nader voters as “disproportionately young, white and well-educated.”
Again, this isn't a surprise. Because if there is anyone who can afford to vote for a candidate and genuinely not care whether he or she wins or loses, it is a young person of privilege who ultimately has very little at stake. For instance, it is doubtful that many of the white, well-educated voters who comprised Nader's core constituency were among those who ultimately comprised the young men and women who ended up losing their lives in the War in Iraq that began under the president Nader helped elect.
And if we're being honest, a person of privilege won't really be that affected by who becomes attorney general or who is nominated to the Supreme Court. What I mean is, a white affluent college student will always be able to secure a safe abortion if she decides she wants one, whether it's legal or not, just as a white affluent student is far less likely to have his life derailed by an arrest for narcotics possession than a poor black one. In both cases their familial and social networks will provide a safety net for them, which is why what motivates their voting decisions will be different than what motivates others.
The fact that Hillary is trouncing Sanders in the first primary state with a sizable black population, South Carolina, speaks volumes. There she is not only leading substantially among total voters but winning up to 80 percent of the black vote.
The reason is simple. If you are worried about your black son possibly walking out the door tomorrow and being shot in either random community violence, or by another George Zimmerman, then determining whether a candidate inspires you is probably not high on your list of Election Day priorities. You've got bigger fish to fry.
Most minorities do.
Recall that even with respect to Barack Obama in 2008, some African-American voters were enthusiastic from the start, but they didn't really go all in until after he won in Iowa—that is to say, until they saw that he was truly electable. More specifically, that he could win support from diverse constituencies—African Americans as well as voters in white states. This is something Sanders hasn't proven.
I guess the question becomes whether the needs of less privileged voters will ever become a priority for more privileged progressives who have the luxury of letting inspiration be their guide.

An invisible army, operating in obscurity, mastering the arts of illusion, deception, and disinformation to defeat the Nazis in World War II. This could be a description of the French Resistance fighters, the band of brothers who operated in utmost secrecy under the noses of the German occupation forces, and have been called “The Army of Shadows.” But it also describes an amazing division of American troops stationed in the European Theatre : the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, AKA “The Ghost Army.” This top-secret unit, so highly classified that its very existence was denied by the Pentagon for 50 years, is finally being not just exposed but placed in the spotlight, by a Michigan Library and an award-winning documentary filmmaker.
The University of Michgan‘s Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library is presenting a “Ghost Army” exhibit through April 30, 2010. It consists of photographs, drawings, and paintings, along with quotations from the soldiers who created them. An accompanying narrative text was written by Exhibits and Outreach Librarian Karen Jordan, and based on research conducted by University of Michigan Art History Ph.D. student Diana Mankowski.
And if you're expecting amateurish pencil sketches by doodling G.I.'s, think again. There's a reason an art history student spent time researching The Ghost Army: the 23rd was an elite unit made up of artists, designers, sound technicians, press agents, makeup artists, and professional photographers. And if you think that description sounds more like a film crew than an army, you're on the right track. The Ghost Army was the brainchild of a movie star, who knew a thing or two about fooling an audience with optical illusions and special effects.
Swashbuckler and Navy Man: Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.
Swashbuckling action star Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. lobbied the Navy brass (he was serving in the United States Naval Reserve) to create a unit based on deception after he completed a tour of England and its special forces installations. Fairbanks had friends in high places, up to and including Franklin D. Roosevelt. The unit ended up as part of the Army in 1944, but the original idea remained unchanged: the 23rd's mission was to deceive the German Army into believing that the Allies possessed more troops and material than they actually did and, even more heroically, to draw enemy fire on themselves, allowing regular combat units to advance with fewer casualties.
The deceptions of The Ghost Army used every theatrical tool at their command. Sound engineers created elaborate, multi-layered recordings of the noises made by infantry, tank, and artillery units in all kinds of weather and from a variety of distances. A few sound trucks armed with nothing more than loud speakers could “impersonate” a battalion of tanks or an entire infantry division. A radio deception section of the unit contributed fake transmissions so convincing they fooled the notorious German radio propagandist, Axis Sally, into reporting an entire Allied division was gearing up for battle in a location where there were no troops at all.

Another tool of trickery involved visual deceptions, created using life-size mock-ups of artillery, trucks, planes, tanks, and even buildings. Jack Masey, who was drafted into the 23rd at age 18, recalled: “We were told we were going to be using inflatable equipment to try and fool the Germans into thinking that we were a real army, when we were in effect, I suppose, a rubber army.” The rubber “big boys,” as they were known, were covered with deliberately ineffective camouflage by the artists of the unit, the better to be noticed, reported, and attacked by the Germans, while real weapons were left alone. Mississippi-born soldier A.B. Wilson said maintaining secrecy and the illusion of realism were the keys to these full-of-hot-air operations: “We had one occasion in France where a fellow decided his tank would look better on the other side of the road, it would be a more natural place for it. So these four guys pick up this tank and go walking across the road with it. And there was a Frenchman coming down the road that sees it, and he thought he was hallucinating to see four men pick up a tank. But the MP's got him right quick, and I'm sure he was never able to tell anyone what he saw for the rest of the war.”

An actor's skills were often required of members of the 23rd, too. This part of the job ranged from the pleasurable to the tedious. Play-acting assignments sometimes resembled R&R. Jack Masey said sometimes the soldiers would visit villages in an effort to fool informants: “We were to be seen, mill around, go to pubs, have a good time, pick up girls, enjoy.” Having memorized the recent history of the unit they were pretending to be part of, the 23rd's repertory company convincingly dropped tidbits of information only the real deal would know. Then they offered a sincere recitation of entirely bogus battle plans, revealing the future position of their battle-scarred unit. Oscar-worthy performances were played out in taverns by these careless “drunks” who spilled vital military intelligence more often than their beers. Lucky members of the unit got instantaneous, if temporary, promotions, according to A.B. Wilson: “Sometimes you'd portray a different rank than what you actually were. Sometimes our colonel was a two-star general, you know, a brigadier general.”

But most assignments were far less enjoyable. Soldiers would drive though villages for hours in looping convoys of trucks meant to transport dozens of men. In fact, they held only the driver and two passengers positioned in the rear, wearing the proper uniforms and patches to mimic the “division” arriving to prepare for battle. Members of the Ghost Army impersonated parts of so many different outfits, redesigning uniforms and attaching and removing shoulder patches so often, some became expert tailors by the end of the war. A.B. Wilson remembered: “We wore the same patches other units wore. We didn't fasten them too tight, because you knew they were going to come off shortly.” (The Ghost Army's real shoulder insignia was never allowed to be worn. It featured a ghost, and Latin slogans meaning “Let's simulate those that do not exist,” and “Those that exist should really be disguised.”)

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Windows Live Messenger was switched off in most of the world in 2013
Microsoft's Windows Live Messenger will be switched off in China in October, marking a final end to the 15-year-old service.
Originally known as MSN Messenger, it was launched in 1999 but was switched off for most users in 2013, after Microsoft bought rival Skype.
Users in China continued to use the old service but will now be transferred to Skype by 31 October.
Windows Live still had as many as 330 million users as recently as 2009.
But those numbers later declined, while users of Skype rose to nearly 300 million by 2012.
The service came to China in 2005, but later faced stiff competition from domestic rivals such as QQ messenger, built by Chinese firm Tencent.
A number of Chinese Windows Live users received emails from Microsoft on Thursday, Chinese newspapers reported, informing them of the planned closure.
The emails told users they would get free Skype credit when they migrated over to the new service, the newspaper said.
MSN Messenger began as a simple text chat service in 1999, a rival to AOL's AIM service and ICQ.
It later added features such as photo delivery, video calls and games as the technology developed.
But Microsoft's purchase of Skype for $8.5bn (£5.1bn) in 2012 spelled the beginning of the end for the service.
Obituary
MSN Messenger was a hard-working internet visionary which taught a generation to touch-type and lol, writes BBC technology reporter Dave Lee.
It touched the lives of millions of teenagers who, in an age before real social networking, were just getting accustomed to what it was like to live on the internet.
MSN Messenger heralded a new era: a time when chatting up a classmate no longer meant the terrifying prospect of actually having to say something to them.
It meant no longer would young teens have to endure the torture of ringing the landline number of their newest crush - knowing there was a high probability that dad would pick up.
But after all the "ASL?"s and "u there?"s, Messenger's loyal subjects became less dependent. "I'll brb", people said... but they never did.
Other sites, smarter and better looking, would see Messenger cast aside. In an age of exciting digital discovery, Messenger became the web's wooden toy.
After a long career, it spent its final year enjoying a comfortable retirement in China. Its less well-regarded relative, Windows Messenger, still battles on on work computers the world over.
"It's like MSN," office workers say, "…just not as fun."
MSN Messenger is survived by Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Snapchat, Skype, Google+ and Instagram.
The Body Issue Cover Model, Amanda Bingson, with her hammer (Photo ESPN)
Meet the Amanda Bingson, the Olympic hammer throwing phenom for the USA, recently rocked the body confidence world when she appeared nude as one of ESPN's Body Issue cover stars. At only 25 years old, Bingson has become a full-blown track and field star after picking up the sport in 2009. She holds the American record for hammer throwing and is a hopeful to make her second Olympic appearance at the 2016 games in Rio De Janiero, Brazil.
I spoke to the very funny, refreshingly open, and self proclaimed “country” athlete who often competes with a flower in her hair and gets a manicure every two weeks to protect her greatest assets, about becoming an overnight role model to otherwise body conscious women and girls everywhere.
Tara Tersigni: Let's start with the most obvious topic, the ESPN Body Issue, so f***ing cool.
Amanda Bingson: Right! [Laughs]
How did ESPN approach you for the issue?
My publicist is the one that kind of put it all together. No one ever really says, “Oh hey we want a track athlete,” “We want a hammer thrower for this.” We pretty much have to go out and find things. Then they were like, “Oh yeah, by the way, ESPN wants you to be in their Body Issue and I was like, “Holy sh**! This is real life? No they don't — stop lying to me!”
Did you get nervous? You're naked in the magazine!
Yeah, it's pretty funny because this was my first photo shoot, my first interview, my first everything. I'm perfectly fine because it's all sink or swim for me. It was just, “Oh hey you're first introduction to the world in media is going to be ESPN Body Issue.” As for being nervous, it was definitely hard, but growing up in Vegas, where I'm so desensitized to the body and the naked body. In Las Vegas billboards are everywhere, sex is just everywhere, and I'm kind used to it. I don't think of it as a bad thing. When they talked about what we wanted to do for the issue I made sure to tell them I want to do purely action shots. I wanted to really be an authentic kind of feel for the hammer. I think doing that made it a lot easier and made me a lot more comfortable, because it wasn't just me standing my boobs up. You know?
That's why you're the perfect person to be on the cover of the Body Issue. Did you ever think, “Ah all my s***'s out and everyone can see it?”
No, it's so funny cause, I was in my robe and I had my publicist give me a little rub down on my shoulders, like I'm about ready to go for a fight. Then I was like, “Okay, I'm ready.” I literally threw the robe off, did a complete spread eagle and was like, “Alright, it's all out there let's go.” My Mom called and asked, “You're wearing underwear and some pasties right?” and I'm said, “Nope. Everybody knows I'm a natural ginger ma. Everybody knows. There are no secrets in our life.” I was just like man, if we're going to do it, just do it. Don't half ass it. I'm just like, “It's a vagina. everyone's seen one, it's OK.” It is what it is.
I mean it's the Body Issue, if you can't handle it you shouldn't be in it.
Exactly! You're sitting taking pictures of naked people and being on set with naked people you'd be pretty comfortable with yourself.
You have become the poster child for body confidence practically overnight.
Right? It's weird.
Did you expect that?
No, god no! When they said ESPN called me up, I thought I'd be like in the background, in the ads and everyone will kind of skip by me. And then they said, “You're going to be on the cover.” I'm like no! I do not have a cover body. This is not what people want to see. And the way it's turned out is just crazy insane! I did not know that it was going to get this much positive attention; which I'm not mad about. I think it's awesome and I think it's great, because we need something like this. I just didn't ever expect that it would be me doing it.
You said you were inspired by the positive feedback, how are you going to help or try to help other girls out there?
A lot of the kids that have been responding to me and writing messages, I tell them you have to find what fits. I've been telling them you have to find something that you're great at, that you love doing, and that needs to be what you're proud of. What I'm doing is opening people's eyes to different worlds that are out there that they can be a part of.
MUMBAI: Data collected by Reserve Bank of India over a period of one year blows the lid off what goes as loan classification in banks. In a presentation at the annual bankers' conference, RBI deputy governor K C Chakrabarty showed how banks have sacrificed over Rs 1 lakh crore by writing off bad loans to corporates, which is much higher than Union finance minister P Chidambaram's farm loan waiver in 2008—a move that received flak from the industry.Under the Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme , 2008, the Centre had waived off around Rs 60,000 crore to farmers.“In the last 13 years, banks have written off 1 lakh crore and 95% of these are large loans. Everyone talks of the farm loan write-off, but it is the medium and large enterprises segment that has a 50% share in NPAs,” said Chakrabarty.The deputy governor flayed banks for using ‘technical write-offs' to reduce their non-performing assets (bad loans) over the years. Technical write-off is a process adopted by banks whereby they take a hit on their profits and stop including the defaulting loan in the list of those from whom repayments are due. It is called a technical write-off because although banks do not show these loans as receivables in their books, they continue to pursue recovery in courts or other forum.A technical write-off enables banks to claim that they do not have any bad loans on their books by fully providing for the loans from their earnings. It also reduces their tax outgo.Chakrabarty also raised the issue of restructured loans—advances where potential defaulters are given more time to repay without being called defaulters. “Restructuring of loans with retrospective effect has killed credit quality in banks,” he said. He warned banks that the leeway might not be available in future.“We must move away from restructuring, there should not be any category called restructuring. The moment it is restructured, it should be declared as NPA, there should not be any technical write-off… be prepared for that, unless you do that you might not be able to get out of the mess,” he said.RBI numbers showed that the banks added Rs 4,94,836 crore to their bad loans between 2007 and 2013. During the same period, they reduced NPAs to the extent of Rs 3,50,332 crore. This was possible because loans worth Rs 1,41,295 crore were written off and another Rs 90,887 crore were upgraded to repaying loans and Rs 1,18,149 crore was recovered from defaulters. According to Chakrabarty, after a technical write-off, there is no incentive to pursue recovery.The deputy governor said that in the case of large loans, there is no one who is accountable for monitoring the loan, as these are sanctioned by the board or a committee. “Between 2007-13, credit to 10 large corporate groups has more than doubled. We have seen that wherever credit growth has been higher, NPAs are also higher.”
Todd Stansbury is the new athletic director at Georgia Tech, the school announced on Thursday.
Stansbury is a Georgia Tech graduate and he also played linebacker for the school in the early 1980s.
"This is home," said Stansbury, a native of Oakville, Canada. "This is where I found who I was."
Stansbury returns to the Yellow Jackets after spending the past year as athletic director at Oregon State. Before that he was the AD at Central Florida from March 2012 through June 2015.
He replaces replaces Mike Bobinski, who was appointed Purdue's athletic director last month. Paul Griffin will continue to serve as interim AD until Stansbury arrives in late November or early December, and also will assist with the transition.
Stansbury also was an academic counselor for Georgia Tech's football program in 1988 and an assistant AD there from 1988 to '95.
Georgia Tech president Bud Peterson said that Stansbury was the school's top candidate.
"I believe that this is one of those rare golden moments in life where opportunity meets ambition," Peterson said. "We welcome Todd Stansbury home."

TORONTO – He may not be the most physically imposing player, but Sebastian Giovinco is definitely forged out of some sturdy material.
The 5-foot-4, 130 lb. Italian firebrand, who has threatened MLS defenses with every twist and turn, is Toronto FC's ironman, having started each of the club's 25 regular season matches this year.
Only defender Justin Morrow comes close to Giovinco, notching one fewer appearance and two fewer starts.
With 2,132 minutes under his belt, Giovinco has only missed a mere 118 minutes of time this season, a sizable chunk of which came when he was forced off with an adductor strain in the 51st minute on Saturday against the Montreal Impact.
The injury not only threatens his streak, but also ruined his much-anticipated return to the Italian national team. Giovinco travelled to Italy's training camp, only to be deemed unable to participate by the team's doctors. He will remain in country for a few days before returning to Toronto later this week ahead of a match on Saturday in Seattle (10 pm ET, TSN2, MLS LIVE).
When pressed after training on Tuesday, TFC head coach Greg Vanney refused to absolutely rule out Giovinco's participation against the Sounders, stating there's “very little chance, but we'll see as he recovers come the end of the week.”
“[There's] no indication it's serious; a couple weeks,” said Vanney. “We're hoping by the time we hit the three-game week [Sept. 13-19 vs. New England, at New York City and vs. Colorado] he'll be back, ready to roll.”
Rather than dwell on his star's injury, Vanney focused on the positives.
“We were going to lose him this weekend one way or the other,” he said. “I see this as an opportunity; a chance for him to relax, physically and mentally recover, and prepare for the final stretch. Sometimes injuries are hidden gems.”
“It's an opportunity for a couple of guys to get a run out,” Vanney continued. “We're going to need everyone as we push towards the playoffs.”
Toronto will definitely be without the services of Jozy Altidore this weekend, who is currently with the US men's national team ahead of their Friday friendly vs. Peru. Together, Altidore and Giovinco have accounted for 27 of Toronto's 44 goals.
“The good thing is we have lots of forwards in our team,” said Vanney. “With Jozy and Seba away, we move into Luke [Moore] and Robbie [Findley] and Herc [Gomez]. We have options that we're very comfortable with. We'll make an assessment over the week and pick the group that will give us the best shot.”
All three of those forwards are in contention, champing at the bit for minutes and goals.
Gomez in particular has looked sharp in training, settling into the team and finishing with an impressive voraciousness after joining TFC on Aug. 7.
“I'm always ready when called upon,” Gomez said on Tuesday after training. “I've been working hard since I got here, trying to improve my fitness. There's really only one way to get match fitness and sharpness, so I'm hoping my number is called upon and I can show I'm ready.”
Added to that eager triumvirate, Vanney will also have both Michael Bradley, who will remain with the club before joining the American side ahead of next week's friendly against Brazil, and Jonathan Osorio, a player he did not expect to be available prior to his surprise non-call for the Canadian national team.
There was one dimension to the Giovinco injury that Vanney admitted was a shame.
“What I'm most disappointed in is that he doesn't get a chance to get back to the Italian national team and show the form that he is in,” he said. “That to me is more disappointing than him not being with us on the weekend. I wish he had that opportunity because he's been in fantastic form. I wish for him that he could prove that for himself.”
It's an annual ritual now, when the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory issues its Sankey diagram of estimated energy use, the one graph that tells so much about where our energy comes from, how it is used, and how it is wasted.
There are glimmers of good news; Solar and wind power are up significantly, but together are still barely rounding errors compared to coal. Total energy use is up by 2.3 quads (quadrillion BTUs). The amount of non-petroleum based energy powering transportation is up by a hair. Otherwise it is the same dismal picture with the same lessons:
1. Our energy efficiency stinks.
Particularly in the transportation sector, where 79% of the energy put into it is wasted. When Mike first showed this graph six years ago, he titled his post Efficiency is Crucial to a Green Future and he is right, gains can be made there. But there are limits to what can be squeezed out of efficiency. The real problem is structural.
2. Transportation remains our single biggest problem.
25 quads of energy to push cars around. The 35 quads of petroleum based energy is the single largest energy source. All kinds of sources add up to the 38 quads of energy generating electricity, but almost all that petroleum goes into cars. While it is true that consumption by buildings is up more than consumption by cars, at 19.99 quads, it is still a whole lot less than the energy used for transportation. As noted last year,
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Department of Energy/Public Domain Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Department of Energy/Public Domain
The biggest problem with our houses and buildings is their location, and the design of our communities that force people to burn 26.7 quads of energy just getting around to them. in 1970, transportation used just about the same as buildings; now it is 50% more. That's sprawl talking.
A look at the carbon emissions Sankey diagram shows that burning petroleum is again the single biggest source of carbon emissions. More total CO2 is created by making electricity, 74% of which goes into residential and commercial buildings, primarily for cooling.
Every year, it is the same story told by these graphs, staring us in the face:
74% of electrical emissions and other building CO2 emissions totals 2061 million metric tons of CO2, or 38% of total carbon emissions. Most of that electricity use is for air conditioning.
Transportation generates 1830 million metric tons, or 33% of total carbon emissions directly from fuel use, and not including the proportion of industrial output that is devoted to making and supporting transportation.
So basically it's the car, driving to air conditioned sprawl, that's responsible for as much as 71% of our carbon emissions. Changing light bulbs doesn't fix that. Really, we have to do everything we can to get people out of their cars, and into walkable communities in temperate climates. Everything else is just gnawing around the edges.
Highlights: Day one at the 1.5C conference on climate change in Oxford
More than 200 climate science and policy researchers, economists and social scientists have descended this week on Keble College in Oxford for a two-day conference entitled “1.5 degrees: Meeting the challenges of the Paris Agreement.” The conference has been organised by the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.
Up for discussion is what kind of evidence the scientific community will need to produce to feed into a special report on 1.5C, requested by the United Nations after Paris and due for publication in 2018.
High profile start
A public event on Tuesday night in Oxford town hall featured several of the architects of the Paris Agreement, ensuring the conference got off to an optimistic start.
Janos Pasztor, senior advisor to the UN Secretary-General, spoke about the policy community passing the baton to the scientists. He told the audience:
“Clearly, a policy decision was taken first, but 1.5C and 2C are not inconsistent with science. I'm not worried.”
Laurence Tubiana, French ambassador for the climate negotiations, offered an insight into the diplomatic processes credited with the success of the Paris agreement. Carbon Brief spoke to Tubiana afterwards about the questions scientists now need to answer about 1.5C. She told us:
“The scientists have to be very clear on the reality: where we are with the carbon budget that is left; how much we have to peak by 2020…And it's very important that the impacts are clearly understood – the difference between 1.5C and 2C and beyond.”
Climate impacts
A key theme for day one at the 1.5C conference was understanding the impacts on natural and human systems of 1.5C of warming, and how they might compare to those at 2C. In the video below, Carbon Brief talks to:
Prof Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science and policy at the University of East Anglia and director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.
Dr Valérie Masson-Delmotte, senior scientist at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement and co-chair of IPCC Working Group I.
Dr Friederike Otto, lecturer in physical geography at the University of Oxford and research fellow at Environmental Change Institute.
Prof David Keith, Gordon McKay professor of applied physics and professor of public policy at Harvard University.
Dr Joeri Rogelj, research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).
Carbon Brief asked a number of attendees of the conference about the impacts of 1.5C of warming, and how they might compare to 2C.
Before the science talks, Dr Anna Pirani, head of the IPCC's Working Group 1 Technical Support Unit, reminded everyone of the short timeline they're working to. To be assessed in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C, papers must be submitted by October 2017 and accepted by April 2018.
Pirani also revealed the draft outline of the 1.5C report, drawn up at a scoping meeting in July. The proposed title and chapter headings will be submitted for approval in October and are, therefore, still subject to change.

After a summary of the warming and impacts we've seen so far by Dr. Valérie Masson-Delmotte, senior scientist at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement and Co-chair of IPCC Working Group I, Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair in climate impacts at the University of Exeter, discussed the importance of climate information at a regional level, not just globally.
Interesting point from @richardabetts: hard to assess CO2 fertilisation when 1.5C cd be anything from 430ppm to 550ppm #1point5 — Oliver Morton (@Eaterofsun) September 21, 2016
Prof Sonia Seneviratne, from the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich, raised an important question that the special report will need to address: are the impacts at 1.5C for extreme weather, biodiversity and crop yields, for example, sufficiently different than at 2C to make the more ambitious target worth pursuing?
Benefits of #1point5 v 2°C warming must be balanced v mitigation impacts – esp. on land use and food production -Prof Seneviratne #biofuels — Ben Abraham (@benabrahamnz) September 21, 2016
Prof Pete Smith, chair in plant & soil science at the Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, summarised what a pathway to 1.5C might mean in terms of “negative emissions” and land use. This included the point, echoed by other speakers this morning, that the special report will need to consider not only the direct impacts of climate change, but also the impacts of steeper mitigation. There will be more on Wednesday.
Pete Smith: We need to invest in test projects for negative emissions technologies "to see which ones have legs" #1point5 — Robert McSweeney (@rtmcswee) September 21, 2016
Rounding up the first morning session, Prof Yadvinder Malhi, head of ecosystems research at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, touched on the risk of an additional 0.5C of warming for biodiversity. The higher the temperature, the greater the risk of reaching a tipping point from which an ecosystem can't recover, he said.
Jason Lowe: Special report will need to address impacts of overshoot and temporary resilience #1point5 — Roz Pidcock (@RozPidcock) September 21, 2016
After a well-earned coffee break, the plenary session turned its focus towards the human impacts of a 1.5C warmer world. Dr Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre, discussed the importance of considering people's overall vulnerability – not just to climate change – and focusing on building resilience.
People facing #climatechange “have to confront choices that have to do with much more than climate alone” @mkvaalst #1point5 — TR_Foundation News (@AlertNet) September 21, 2016
This point was picked up by Dr Stéphane Hallegatte, a senior economist in the climate change group at the World Bank, who highlighted that development “is more important than targeted adaptation” for reducing the potential impacts of climate change.
@hallegatte: To reduce climate impacts on people, "good development" is more important than targeted adaptation #1point5 — Robert McSweeney (@rtmcswee) September 21, 2016
He also cautioned that a 1.5C limit shouldn't affect the design of adaptation strategies as they need to account for the possibility of higher temperatures anyway – in case we miss the 1.5C goal.
Parallel sessions
The afternoon's sessions saw attendees choose between four topics: mitigation options, the sensitivity of natural systems, human impacts of 1.5C, and implications for adaptation.
The mitigation session saw a series of presentations about emotive, sometimes controversial topics. Prof Alice Larkin at the Tyndall Centre in Manchester focused on aviation and shipping emissions and came to the stark conclusion that both sectors face potential unfeasible reductions in their emissions intensity if they are to “do their share” of staying within the 1.5C limit.
For aviation to do its bit for good chance of staying within 1.5C, @AliceClimate says needs 20% intensity reduction PER YEAR #1point5 pic.twitter.com/z8XDwRCBSY — Leo Hickman (@LeoHickman) September 21, 2016
The session also included a number of presentations about negative emissions technologies and geoengineering. Henrik Karlsson of Biorecro countered the mood of the room by being very positive about BECCS (bioenergy and carbon capture and storage) arguing that it had already been proven at a commercial scale.
Let's just say that Henrik Larsson of Biorecro is *very* optimistic about negative emissions from BECCS #1point5 pic.twitter.com/Sg4v5OJowr — Leo Hickman (@LeoHickman) September 21, 2016
Dr David Keith, professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, concluded the session with a plea that the audience reassess their negative preconceptions about solar geoengineering.
I detest seemingly objective/scientific claims that hide the hard value choices, hard politics. Solar #geoengineering is a hard choice. https://t.co/xedAx72bmr — David Keith (@DKeithClimate) September 21, 2016
The natural systems session spanned a range of topics, from Antarctic sea ice to wheat production in Tunisia and reindeer in the Arctic tundra.
Dr Carl-Friedrich Schleussner from Climate Analytics began by explaining how the large majority of tropical coral reefs are at risk at 1.5C, whereas all will be at risk at 2C. Greater habitat disruption to grow bioenergy might mean that some impacts of 1.5C are worse for biodiversity than those at 2C, warned Dr Jeff Price, senior researcher at the University of East Anglia.
"0.5C will make a huge difference in the African region in terrestrial point of view" says @Dr Jeff Price #1point5 — Boi Tshwene (@BoiChaz) September 21, 2016
Prof Bruce Forbes from the Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland reminded the audience that regional warming in the Northwest RussIan Arctic already exceeds 1.5C, with consequences for reindeer feeding and survival.
Impacts at 2C not just a bit bigger than #1point5: potential for different sign of change in polar regions. Great talk by @emilyshuckburgh — 1p5deg (@1p5deg) September 21, 2016
In the adaptation session, chaired by co-chair of IPCC Working Group II Dr Debra Roberts, presenters looked at the implications for coping with a 1.5C warmer world.
Prof Robert Nicholls, professor of coastal engineering at the University of Southampton, started things off by looking at how sea level rise would affect some of the world's largest deltas. He described how limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C gives deltas more time to adapt to rising seas, but “does not avoid the [eventual] impacts due to the commitment to sea level rise which continues for centuries”.
Prof Robert Nicholls of @unisouthampton: 1.5C limits impact of sea level rise on deltas – especially beyond 2100 #1point5 — Robert McSweeney (@rtmcswee) September 21, 2016
Nicholls was followed by a series of presentations taking us through the different sectors and facets of adaptation. Prof John Antle discussed adapting agriculture and food systems for 1.5C, while Dr Mike Morecroft spoke on building ecological networks to protect biodiversity. Prof Nijavalli Ravindranath talked us through developing adaptation strategies through assessing vulnerability, and Meghan Bailey presented her PhD research on adaptation financing. Finishing the session was Patrick Pringle, the deputy director of UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP), who discussed the tricky task of implementing adaptation actions.
Patrick Pringle: "We need to value the cement as much as the bricks." – bring together research, policy and practice #1point5 — Robert McSweeney (@rtmcswee) September 21, 2016
Day one rounded off with a final plenary discussion on the moral implications of the 1.5C goal.
A two-meter long hippopotamus jumped out of a moving truck as it was being transported from Miaoli county to a farm in Taichung in central Taiwan. It then hit a parked car and landed in the middle of the street. With its teeth knocked out and severe blood loss, the hippo lay paralyzed on the ground for hours with tears flowing from its eyes.
Upon hearing the sound of the impact and seeing the large creature, the owner of the parked car said he “thought it was a dinosaur”.
Officials from Miaoli's agriculture bureau say that the hippopotamus is not a state-protected animal in Taiwan, but each case of fostering should be reported and listed.
The owner of the hippopotamus later arrived on the scene and said that it was legally imported and given as a gift to Taichung county. The county government then re-gifted it to his farm where it has been for 6 to 7 years.
The hippo was relocated to a pond in Yuanli 3 days ago due to some maintenance work on his farm, and is likely to havehave panicked for some reason on its home. The owner notified the vet and called for backup vehicles. The hippo then got tranquilized and sent back to the farm.

Locals have asked why the hippopotamus was not tranquilized earlier, and why it was not transported in a safer way.

A twin bomb attack in Syria's capital, Damascus, has killed 40 Iraqis and wounded 120, Iraq's government says.
Photo: AFP
The attack was near the Bab al-Saghir cemetery, which houses Shia mausoleums, with those targeted said to be pilgrims arriving by bus.
Sunni militants often target Shias but attacks in the capital are uncommon.
A nationwide truce brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran took effect on 30 December after talks in Kazakhstan, but sporadic attacks continue.
There have been two rounds of talks, with another planned next week.
Damascus is mostly under the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but rebel groups are present in outlying districts of the city.
It is not yet clear who was behind the latest attack, which Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Jamal called a "criminal terrorist operation".
Images showed blood stains on the ground near several damaged buses.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a roadside bomb blew up as a bus passed and a suicide bomber also detonated explosives.
A double suicide bombing in the Kafr Sousa district of the capital in January killed at least 10 people.
Former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham said it was behind that attack.
The group is excluded from the peace talks and its mainly north-western bases have been regularly targeted by the Syrian army and its Russian allies.
So-called Islamic State is another Sunni extremist group that controls significant areas of Syria. Its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul is currently under attack from Iraqi government forces and their allies.
More than 300,000 people have been killed and 11 million others displaced since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011.

Consequence of turning “home” into a financialized “asset class.”
Something happened on the way when the concept of “home” transmogrified to a financialized “asset class” whose price the government, the Fed, and the industry conspire to inflate into the blue sky, no matter what the consequences. And here are the consequences.
The Census Bureau, which has been tracking homeownership rates in its data series going back to 1965 on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, just reported that in the second quarter 2016, the homeownership rate dropped to 62.9%, the lowest point on record.
It matches the low point in Q1 and Q2 of 1965 when the data series began. At no time in between did it ever fall this low. And it was down half a percentage point from 63.4% a year ago.
The relentless slide has lasted for 12 years, from its peak of 69.2% in Q4 2004, which was when the Greenspan Fed's low interest rates were boosting speculation in the housing sector, and prices were going haywire. At the time, the concept of “home” had already become an asset class that can never lose money, financialized and later shorted by Wall Street, subsidized by government agencies, and backstopped by the Fed.
And this is what happened to homeownership rates afterwards:
The 1.9 percentage point drop from Q3 2014 (65.3%) to Q2 2015 (63.4%) was the largest two-year drop in the history of the data series. It also coincided with steep increase in home prices.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the homeownership rate dropped to 63.1% in Q2, the lowest in the non-seasonally-adjusted data series going back to 1985.
There are numerous reasons for this, some known and others still to be guessed at, including:
Rising home prices in an economy of stagnant wages (for the lower 80%) have pushed entry-level homes out of reach for many people.
Lower priced homes in many urban areas entail a huge and costly ($ and time) commute every day. And even then, these homes may be too much of stretch for big parts of the population in expensive urban areas.
First time buyers are having trouble saving for a down payment since they spend their last available dime to meet soaring rents.
Millennials have been blamed. They always get blamed for everything. They saw their parents deal with the American Dream as it turned into the American Nightmare, and they learned their lesson early in life.
The super-low interest rate environment hasn't made homes more affordable because home prices, in response to super-low interest rates, have soared, and in the end, mortgage payments are higher than they were before.
Higher home prices entail other costs that are higher, including taxes, brokerage fees, and insurance.
The fact that Housing Bubble 2 in most urban areas is now even more magnificent than the prior housing bubble that blew up with such fanfare, even while real incomes have stagnated for all but the top earners, is a sign that the Fed has succeeded elegantly in pumping up nearly all asset prices to achieve its “wealth effect,” come heck or high water. In this ingenious manner, it has “healed” the housing market.
It's two-year bout of flip-flopping about raising rates just puts some lipstick on these policies that include the purchase of agency mortgage-backed securities, which the Fed continues to buy to replace those that mature and roll off its balance sheet.
Just today, as part of its routine, it acquired $2.6 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities. On July 26, it acquired $2.0 billion. On July 25, $1.9 billion; on July 22, $1.3 billion, on July 21, $2.5 billion; on July 20, $1.9 billion…. and so on.
As MBS mature and are redeemed, the Fed takes this money and goes to its primary dealers (list) and buys more of them, which puts downward pressure on mortgage rates and prevents the free market from playing any kind of role, all in the religious believe that inflating home prices beyond all recognition is somehow good for the economy and Wall Street, despite the consequences, such as plunging homeownership rates, as America turns from a country of homeowners into a country of renters, often dwelling in a corporate-owned financialized asset class.
At the luxury end, something new is hitting the housing market: Manhattan and Miami are already getting mauled. Now it's expanding to San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, San Diego, even Texas! Read… US Government Mucks up Money-Laundering in Real Estate, Puts Luxury Housing Bubbles at Risk

A Calgary woman claims an aggressive beauty product sales pitch in the terminal of the Calgary International Airport went too far and says the bullying tactics left her facing a hefty credit card charge.
Prior to a recent flight, Carol-Ann Villeneuve was making her way towards airport security when a salesman with Elements Spa Boutique called out to her.
“He says come, come sit down I'll give you a sample for your eyes,” recalls Villeneuve of the cosmetics sales pitch. “I'll apply and I'll show you how good they are.”
The 64-year-old says the salesman convinced her to try a line of eye care products but she was shocked when the price of the products was disclosed.
“He says $3,300,” said Villeneuve. “I said ‘Oh my god no. That's too expensive'. He says ‘Yes you can do it', the usual thing, you know, that I owe it to myself.”
Villeneuve says the employee would not back down. Fearing she would miss her flight, she handed the salesman her credit card.
The sales pitch continued and Villeneuve says the employee asked for her boarding pass to convince her that she had more time. At the end of her 40 minute experience with the Elements Spa Boutique staff member, Villeneuve's final bill was staggering.
“$10,291,” said Villeneuve, a total she says she continues to feel terrible about. “Why wasn't I strong enough to get up and leave?”
Officials with the Calgary Airport Authority call the alleged sales tactics unacceptable.
“We are aware of some concerns with this particular retailer,” explained Henry Stevens, the Calgary Airport Authority's manager of corporate communications. “It's something we're taking very, very seriously.”
High pressure sales tactic can breach Alberta's Fair Trading Act.
“You cannot exert undue pressure or influence on the consumer to enter into a transaction,” said Mohammed El Hazzouri, assistant professor of marketing at Mount Royal University's Bisset School of Business.
Villeneuve says she attempted to return the items eight days after her purchase but was told her money would not be refunded and she could only exchange the products.
CTV Calgary visited Elements Spa Boutique and contacted its owner, a numbered company based in Ontario, looking for a response to Villeneuve's accusations. Representatives were unwilling to appear in an on-camera interview but the company issued the following email statement:
“The manner in which the sales associate in question behaved doesn't follow our philosophy or our strategies and that's why the individual is no longer part of our team.”
“Our top priority now is to ensure that the customer receives her lawful right back, which is a full refund.”
Villeneuve hopes others can learn from her expensive and embarrassing experience.
“It could have been somebody else. It wasn't just me and I'm sure there are other people out there.”
Lawyers representing Villeneuve and Elements Spa Boutique are now involved in the dispute. Villeneuve says she has yet to receive the refund the company promised in its email to CTV Calgary.

Recent US media reports have suggested that the Pentagon might propose sending ground combat forces into Syria "to speed up" the fight against Daesh. Commenting on these contemplations, Syrian political leader Khalaf al-Muftah told Sputnik that the decision will jeopardize all Syrian government efforts to settle the conflict politically.
The US Defense Department "might propose that the US send conventional ground combat forces into northern Syria for the first time to speed up the fight against ISIS (Daesh)", according to a recent CNN report.
"It's possible that you may see conventional forces hit the ground in Syria for some period of time," the channel quotes one defense official, without revealing his name, as saying.
The official however reportedly emphasized that any decision is "ultimately up to President Donald Trump, who has ordered his defense secretary to come up with a proposal to combat ISIS before the end of the month."
Commenting on the above contemplations, Khalaf al-Muftah, a member of the Syrian Regional Leadership of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party told Sputnik that the Syrian government strongly opposes the suggestion as it will jeopardize all Syrian government efforts to settle the conflict politically.
"The foreign intervention is rejected by all Syrian political forces, as it will only escalate tensions and re-instigate the conflict. Interference will threaten the security of the whole region, especially of Iraq and Lebanon," he told Sputnik.
Besides, the politician said, it will ruin all the efforts of the Syrian government to settle the conflict politically and will create big problems for the US leadership.

However apart from being opposed by the Syrian leadership, this decision also runs contrary to international law, the politician said.
According to international legislation, the US should apply to the UN Security Council, which should further approve of the operation.
"Russia, China and Syria's other allies will use their right to veto this initiative," Khalaf al-Muftah suggested.
Ahead of the more intra-Syrian peace talks in Geneva and following peace negotiations in Astana, the question on everyone's minds is whether Syrians will be able to return to a normal life and heal the scars of war when the conflict comes to an end.
Since 2011, the country has been marred by the ongoing war. The unrest grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Many protesters originally urged for political reforms, more freedom and pluralism.
However, two or three weeks later these demonstrations were hijacked by Islamist terrorists and their Western and regional backers, who not only sought to topple President Bashar al-Assad but also began to kill off ethnic and religious minorities in the country.
The internal fighting between government forces and various Western- and Wahhabi backed opposition and terrorist groups has claimed thousands of lives. The conflict has compelled over 4 million people to leave their homes.

A group of Western-backed Syrian insurgents said on Tuesday they had killed three foreign fighters - two Saudis and a Tunisian - with ISIS in an undercover raid into an area under the control of the ultra-radical militants.
An alliance of rebel groups known as Jabhat al-Shamiya (Levant Front) operating in the northern Aleppo countryside near the border with Turkey said the operation was conducted by their clandestine security unit and was the first of its kind.
They pledged further commando strikes in the future.
"We promise Baghdadi (ISIS leader) more of these security operations in the heart of areas under the control of his fighters," a statement by the Levant Front said.
The region has witnessed intensified fighting in Syria's civil war between Western-backed rebels and Islamist insurgents who have gained further ground, threatening the fall of most of the northern countryside of Aleppo into their hands.
ISIS has now encircled the rebel-held town of Marea, 20 km (12 miles) from the Turkish border, an area that also falls within a "safe zone" Turkey said last month it would set up in northern Syria to help keep ISIS at bay.
The militants have since May made advances that threaten a major supply route used by rival rebels into the city of Aleppo.
On Tuesday, Western-backed rebels accused Islamic State of firing at least 15 mustard gas mortars during heavy shelling of Marea. A loss of Marea would make it harder for Turkey and the United States to open a new front in the region against Islamic State in coordination with rival rebels on the ground.
Western-backed rebels have sent in reinforcements from other parts of Aleppo province to try to beat back the jihadists, according to a Levant Front fighter.
ISIS holds large swathes of territory across Syria and Iraq, and has advanced in other areas of Syria in recent months, capturing the central city of Palmyra.
The militant group is fighting rival insurgents, the Syrian military and Kurdish regional forces alike in Syria's four-year-old civil war.

Moist banana cakes with sweet, warming cinnamon icing.Made in pumpkin, bat and ghost cake moulds, these little cakes were made for my Grandma's birthday, she will be 83 on Halloween. A while back we were talking and she mentioned she hadn't had banana cake in years when a friend of hers used to make them so I thought it would be a nice trip down memory lane for her as well as celebrating her favourite holiday of the year.As well as using Instagram (I'm claremanson on there by the way) on my phone I also took some photos on my camera which I might eventually get around to uploading but those of you who keep up with my journal will know my family and I have not been well and are not back to 100% yet. On top of that, being on a computer or phone screen makes me super light headed, hurts my eyes and makes me a little dizzy, probably from too much time editing photos on the computer and browsing the internet on my phone which I have only had a month so I think a lot of it might be eye strain as it feels a lot better when away from a screen.Anyway today I felt just about well enough to make myself do some baking for the birthday girl, we will be having her in our house tomorrow and taking her out to lunch at a new cafe she has been wanting to go to for a while now.So, happy Halloween everyone, happy 1st year wedding anniversary to my husband and happy 83rd birthday to my Grandma for tomorrow.Facebook www.facebook.com/claremanson
Republicans over the weekend amped up criticism of the media, arguing that journalists appear to be largely in cahoots with Hillary Clinton and her campaign to defeat Donald Trump.
"I think that without the unending one-sided assault of the news media, Trump would be beating Hillary by 15 points," Trump surrogate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an interview on ABC's "This Week."
"This is about last Friday, when the networks spent 23 minutes on the Trump tape, and less than one minute, all three networks combined, on Hillary Clinton's secret speeches that were being revealed on WikiLeaks," he added, an allusion to the publication of emails obtained from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.
Gingrich's critique followed a Saturday speech by Trump in which he said the election was being "rigged by corrupt media" pushing "completely false" allegations.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican nominee for vice president, delivered a similar message on the Sunday edition of CBS' "Face the Nation."
"I think what Donald Trump is talking about is, frankly, what appears to be the monolithic support of the national media for Hillary Clinton's campaign," Pence said. "The American people are getting awful tired of this two-on-one fight with many of you in the national media doing half of Hillary Clinton's work for her every day."
The media critique dovetails off a week of accusations levied against Trump by women who claim Trump sexually harassed them, in some cases decades ago. Though the accusations were greeted with initial fanfare from the media, subsequent information undermining claims made by at least five of the women has received far less interest.
The issue exploded with an accusation by Jessica Leeds, published in the New York Times Oct. 12, claiming Trump had touched her inappropriately during a commercial flight in 1979. Evidence to call her story into queston quickly emerged, but the Times' online homepage on Sunday made no reference to the contradictory information, including disputes about an armrest, four days after the report was initially published.
The Times did not answer a query by the Washington Examiner about why it seemingly hadn't grappled with this new information. It did retain the link for a recorded interview with Leeds.
Trump singled out the Times in his criticism on Twitter over the weekend, saying in one message, "The failing NY Times reporters don't even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!"
Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016
The failing @nytimes reporters don't even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2016
The attack came in addition to more generic broadsides. "The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD," Trump said in another. He added, "Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!"
Nonetheless, Democrats insist the escalating media criticism is unmerited. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in a Sunday interview with Raddatz that Trump was seeking to "bully" the media, among others, because of the election.
"[Trump] is swinging at every phantom of his own imagination because he knows he's losing," Kaine said. "He's making weird claims that, no, I couldn't have assaulted this person, she's not attractive enough to assault.
"How bizarre is that? He's blaming the media; he's blaming the GOP; he's saying that America can't run a fair election. And this is what bullies do," Kaine added.
Around 1,400 passengers were grounded at Warsaw's Frederic Chopin airport Sunday, after hackers attacked ground computer systems used to issue flight plans.
A spokesman for state-run airline LOT, Adrian Kubicki, said the problem was fixed after around five hours, but that 10 of the carrier's domestic and international flights had to be cancelled. About a dozen more were delayed.
"We're using state-of-the-art computer systems, so this could potentially be a threat to others in the industry," he said, adding that the safety of ongoing flights had not been compromised.
The affected flights were bound for Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Copenhagen and domestic destinations.
LOT said some passengers had since been able to board their flights, but that the remainder had been put up in hotels on Sunday evening.

Excerpts:
A Michigan family which had dreams of camping during the summer in the great outdoors was horrified when state officials seized their six children simply because they were temporarily living in tents, Off The Grid News has learned.
The nightmare experience for Christopher and Antonia Hernandez began May 19 when Otsego County sheriff deputies and a CPS official took their children, and ended June 10 when their children were returned after the parents won a court ruling based on the fact the mother and children are eligible for enrollment in the Tlingit Native American tribe. The federal Indian Child Welfare Act makes it more difficult for state officials to separate Native American families. Michigan has a similar state law.
If the family had not had the Tlingit link, the case still would be ongoing, with the children still in foster care.
But the removal never should have taken place, Christopher and Antonia told Off The Grid News, which has read the court documents – one of which criticizes the family for not having electricity or a water source. The family was near a state park and had purchased a pass to shower and bathe there. The parents also had a generator.
They had been living in the tents for nine days when police arrived.
“The government has tried to standardize what a home is and what a home must have, without consideration for if the children's needs are being met or not,” Christopher and Antonia said in a joint statement. “This was not a case of neglect, but a case of the government telling us how we have to raise our children — that we must have running water, we must have electricity and we can't stay in a tent for the summer. To the government it makes no difference if the children are happy and healthy. We need to conform to their idea of normal or they can take your children away.”

Sir Bob Jones has taken delivery of his own jet, less than three months after being ejected from an Air New Zealand flight.
Jones' new Cessna Citation Mustang, which has an estimated price tag of between $2 million and $2.5million, touched down in the capital last week, after a long-haul flight from the United States.
And it seems its arrival has come not a moment too soon.
"I should have done this years ago," he wrote in his latest National Business Review column.
"Like the prime minister, I too am 'not a particularly lavish guy' but, my God, there are limits.
"For more than half a century I've travelled everywhere – but no airline, not even in the worst Soviet Union days, matches the infantile nappy-statism of an Auckland-Wellington Air New Zealand flight."
Jones was escorted off such a flight in May for not following crew instructions – or as he put it in his column: "The incessant and unnecessary hostess babble over the intercom, the utterly childish and pointless screeching safety video, the absurd seat-by-seat check that we're an inch or two upright at exactly 20 minutes before landing, and worst of all, the 'This is your captain speaking'."
And his response to the arrival of his own twin-engined jet was: "Oh glory; my self-respect finally regained.
"No unnecessary 20-minute X-ray queues, no holding pens and more queues to board, no sitting around for five minutes after landing before the doors are opened, nor long baggage waits amidst the sunglasses-topped cellphone bawlers."
Instead, he drove to the Wellington hangar, threw his bags on board and took off immediately. The exact same process occurred on the return flight.
"Two horrific hours saved. I should have done this years ago."
A spokeswoman at Jones' office said he did not want to comment any further on his latest purchase.
The jet is 12 metres long, has a wingspan of 13 metres and cruises along at 630kmh, with a top speed of 772kmh.
Last week, Jones was listed at No 15 on the latest NBR Rich List, with an estimated wealth of $620m.

We've all seen them. Television commercials from Big Pharma promising love and happiness if we take the products being advertised. Kathleen Slattery-Moschkau, a former 10 year Pharma sales rep, in 2009 explained how the industry manipulates consumers with its advertising: “We've seen the industry medicalizing so many different things throughout your life. If you're shy, take a pill. If you're a little anxious take a pill.” Watch her explain how the industry advertises:
It's true that medical drugs are an important component in the American health care system, but the commercials pushed by big drugmakers are sometimes incredibly deceptive, despite reaching millions of people.
And while most businesses can deduct marketing costs from their tax bills, the pharmaceutical industry gets rare and coveted direct-to-consumer access through its television advertising while getting to deduct costs for this marketing. According to FireDogLake's David Dayen, there are only two countries in the world that allow this — New Zealand and the United States.
Some Members of Congress don't think we should provide such a huge tax break to an industry with such special access to consumers. Last year, Rep. Jarrold Nadler (D-NY) introduced a bill to disallow these special tax breaks that effectively subsidize the pharmaceutical industry's drug barrage on the American people. “There is absolutely no reason for the federal government to provide major tax breaks to pharmaceutical companies creating advertisements for their own financial enrichment,” said Nadler.
But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug industry's trade association, wants to protect its special tax break. According to the Blog of Legal Times (BLT), PhRMA just hired the lobbying firm Polsinelli Shugart to lobby on “tax issues related to the deductibility of advertising costs.” Polsinelli partner James Davidson will be handling the PhrMA account.
Davidson is a veritable super-lobbyist. He handles clients as diverse as the Walt Disney Company to Time Warner to the Grocery Manufacturers Association. He is also director of The Advertising Coalition, whose members include the broadcasters, magazine companies, and other corporations that are enriched by pharmaceutical advertising.
Members of Congress like Nadler have been trying for years to take away Big Pharma's special tax break it uses to deceptively advertise directly to Americans. Unfortunately, the tax break's proponents are big spenders. BLT notes that PhRMA in 2011 “spent $18.79 million on federal government advocacy work done by its own staffers and outside lobbyists, according to congressional records.”
A senior Russian defense official says Moscow will have its first combat UAV ready by 2020.
Russia's first combat unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will enter into service sometime in 2020, a senior Russian official has said.
According to Russian state media, Deputy Defense Minister Yury Borisov recently said Moscow would begin research and development on the combat UAV this year with plans to begin testing it in 2017. “We are ready to consider starting a development work this year with plans to complete it and move on to the official tests or experimental military use of future devices in 2017,” Borisov said, according to RIA Novosti.
Last month, Russia's Defense Ministry said that Moscow would spend upwards of $9.2 billion on UAVs through 2020. This was up from the $8.8 billion Russia intended to spend through 2020.
Russia has compared the Skad combat UAV it is developing to the American-made Х-47. The Skad is reportedly 10 tons with a 4,000 km range and a speed of at least 800 km per hour. According to Russia & India Report, the Skad combat UAV will be capable of “carrying two air-to-surface/anti-radiation missiles or two smart bombs with a total weight of no more than one ton.” The same article noted that Russia has given a contract tender to the Sukhoi design bureau for a combat UAV that is being called X-40, however, little is known about the characteristics of that particular drone.
Russian news reports suggest that America's use of drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan are the primary impetus for Moscow's own drive to build combat UAVs. The reports also suggested the reduced training cost of UAV operators as well as the alleged use of Israeli-made UAVs by Georgia during its 2008 war with Russia as motivating Moscow's push for drones. Late last year, Russia opened up a new base near Moscow to train UAV operators.
The reports once again highlight the reality that armed drones are likely to proliferate across the world in the coming years. In a report released this month, the Council on Foreign Relations' Micah Zenko and Sarah Kreps argue: “Russia, China, Iran, South Korea, and Taiwan, for example, have begun to develop increasingly sophisticated indigenous drone capabilities. Other countries, including Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have publicized their intent to purchase them.”
They also argue that: “Drones should be treated as a distinct class of weapons. They have unique properties that lead them to be used, and defended against, in ways that are destabilizing.”
In particular, the authors argue that the presence of armed UAVs will increase countries' willingness to resort to the use of armed force.
“Governments are more willing to use them over other weapons platforms because the associated costs and risks are assumed to be comparably lower,” Zenko and Kreps write.
Kreps also discusses the issue of drone proliferation in a video embedded below:
Yesterday morning on Fox News, former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani told the audience that police officers were not allowed on the convention floor in uniform.
“Philadelphia police officers are not in the convention hall. They're not allowed in uniform,” said Giuliani.
“I would say it's because the Democratic Party delegates are anti-police, anti-law enforcement. They hate the police. Republicans are not embarrassed by police officers,” Giuliani said.
The New York Post spoke to three police officers that confirmed Giuliani's statements.
The Post interviewed three police officers who confirmed they were ordered to steer clear of the convention floor during the proceedings while wearing their uniforms. The Philadelphia Police Department said officers “have worked in conjunction with the Secret Service throughout this event, which includes the interior portion of the venue as well as the exterior portion.”
The DNC featured one police officer, Pittsburgh police Chief Cameron McLay, to speak about policing and community relations. He has come under fire from his fellow officers for participating in a political event.
“Anyone who believes in any way, shape or form that the DNC is not a political campaign is an idiot,” he said, referring to a provision in the municipal code that prohibits campaigning by police in uniform: “No officer or employee of the Department of Police shall campaign for a candidate for any office or for a ballot issue while on duty, while wearing a uniform or while on City property. Nor may he/​she identify himself/​herself as an employee of the Department of Police.”
McLay denied his speech was "campaigning" but admitted his speech was reviewed by professional speechwriters.

Decepticon brings together researchers and practitioners in the detection and prevention of deception. Previously, deception research has been fragmented across conferences in many different disciplines, sub-disciplines and countries. To cover the great diversity of approaches to deception research, our scientific committee has members covering domains such as:
Psychology (e.g., forensic, social, cognitive, neuro, evolutionary, developmental, marketing/consumer)
Behavioral economics (e.g., preventing and deterring deception, deception in companies)
Law (e.g., police interviewing, polygraph use, malingering, deception in court)
Computing (e.g., using technology to detect deceit, machine learning)
Security (e.g., fraud, cybercrime, border control, lying about intentions)
Communication (e.g., interactional dynamics, verbal and nonverbal cues to deceit)
Anthropology (e.g. cultural differences in both the acceptability of deceit and the display of cues)
Philosophy (e.g., self-deception, what is and is not deception)
Knowledge of the detection and prevention of deceptive behavior is widely applicable to both theory and practice in a range of different fields. So we encourage both academics and practitioners to attend; submit an abstract if you want to give a talk or present a poster, or just come along and join in!
News
Special sessions
We have organized four special sessions for you, two panels in which prominent deception researchers will discuss their view on future directions in the field and on the role technology should play in such directions. These sessions will be followed by a discussion during which the audience can actively engage, ask questions and stir up discussions with the speakers. This is the perfect opportunity to ask those questions you never dared to ask, and to get inspired! The other two special sessions are more practical and provide an intriguing insight into the world of deception in the streets, from pickpocketers and other con artists to the use of magic and suggestion to openly mislead people.

Why does a man need a woman's consent for a vasectomy but a woman doesn't need a mans for an abortion?
It just doesn't seem fair that the father has no decision in the life of his children if the mother decides to abort. Yet if the man wants a vasectomy the wife/partner needs to give consent. How is that fair? Do you think that there should be laws protecting a father's rights? I don't want any "It's her body,... show more It just doesn't seem fair that the father has no decision in the life of his children if the mother decides to abort. Yet if the man wants a vasectomy the wife/partner needs to give consent. How is that fair? Do you think that there should be laws protecting a father's rights?
I don't want any "It's her body, her choice" answers because in a committed relationship situation, if a woman gets pregnant it should be up to both parents not just one.
Update: I have known a few men who have had a vasectomy and had to have their wife's approval/permission for the doctor to go through with it. I tried to find a link from Google to post, but all I was getting were other message boards saying how they were denied the vasectomy when their wife declined to approve it.
Update 2: Okay, I just read up on it and it turns out that the LAW does not require a wife's consent, but the specific clinic or hospital may deny a man the vasectomy if the wife does not approve and that is legal.
THE QUEEN'S speech will be delayed while Democratic Unionists and Tories debate whether cats help witches cast spells against Christians.
DUP leader Arlene Foster has refused to support the government until they commit to a crackdown on witchcraft, including a zero-tolerance approach to goblins and the reintroduction of the scold's bridle.
Foster said: “Cats do the bidding of their warlock owners and cavort regularly with Satan, or as I call him, the Pope.
“Everyone knows that you cannot cast black magic without cats, although we are also opposed to owls, imps, and dogs that turn into headless men at night.
“We are committed to supporting a strong and stable government in the national interest, but not at the cost of allowing these demonic beasts to continue infesting our homes.”
A Conservative party spokesman said: “We're not going to commit to something pointless and cruel, or pander to the whims of extremists for the sake of power.
“Anyway, back to discussing benefit sanctions and Brexit.”

The Broncos will cut defensive end Elvis Dumervil on Friday if he doesn't take a significant pay cut. Although all indications are that Dumervil isn't willing to cut his pay by as much as the Broncos want, Denver front office boss John Elway says he wants Dumervil to realize that there's just no way he's ever going to get paid the $12 million salary on his current contract.
“It's so far out of whack,” Elway told the Denver Post of Dumervil's salary. “Hopefully, he realizes that.”
Elway says he feels bad asking a good player to take a pay cut and understands why players resist. But he also said it's just part of the business.
“These are the deals that wrench your gut,” Elway said. “As an ex-player, I hate to see that. I hated to see that happen to a teammate. And I hate having to do it, in the position I'm in. But I've got to do what's best for this football team.”
It's looking like Elway will decide that what's best for the Broncos is to release Dumervil and sign another defensive end.
Our claim for the LoC is the line along the Saltoro ridge which separates the 76 km long Siachen Glacier from the Konduz Galcier to the West. Pakistan claims that the LoC should run from NJ 9842 to Karakoram Pass thus laying claim to the Saltoro Ridge and the Siachen Glacier. Due to pro-active occupation of Saltoro and the denial of all passes to Pakistan for access to the sub glaciers since 1984, India has virtually sealed Pakistan's fate. Pakistan has no visibility over the glacier and has been desperate for a toehold on the Saltoro in the vicinity of the passes so as to have a ‘peep' at Siachen. All hype about Siachen in Pakistan is to project what the Pakistan Army wishes to sell back home. The sales pitch is to brand India the aggressor, draw moral support and promote a perception that its troops are deployed at Siachen.
Gov. Kate Brown was bullish in defending her record as governor and her decision to endorse Measure 97, the proposed major corporate tax increase, during the third gubernatorial debate, held Thursday at Churchill High School in Eugene.
Measure 97, the Portland Democrat said, would help reduce public school classroom sizes and help pay for the recent expansion of the Oregon Health Plan, which provided health insurance to 400,000 new people.
�We�ve made so much progress,� she said. �I�m not willing to go backwards.�
Brown�s main challenger, Republican Bud Pierce, critiqued Brown�s record on public education, saying that Oregon�s schools slipped substantially in national rankings during her many years in the Legislature.
Still reeling from the widespread criticism that followed his comment last week that better-educated women were less vulnerable to domestic violence, Pierce generally was subdued in his criticism of the incumbent.
Cliff Thomason, a Grants Pass Realtor, hemp farmer and the Independent Party candidate, made his first appearance in a gubernatorial debate Thursday. He used the opportunity to say that all high school students should get equivalency diplomas (GEDs) after their sophomore year, and that the state should promote the use of hemp in biofuels.
The event, hosted by Oregon Public Broadcasting and the League of Women Voters of Lane County, filled about two-thirds of the auditorium at Churchill, with many students in attendance. The debate moderator was Dave Miller, host of the OPB radio news show �Think Out Loud.�
Pierce�s comment last week, that women with �great education and training and a great job� aren�t as susceptible to domestic violence, has become a key talking point in the race.
At an earlier press conference, Pierce again apologized for the remark, saying it was because of a �blind spot� in his personal knowledge and that he was unaware that so many women are victims of domestic violence. He said he didn�t think the statement made him any less qualified to be Oregon�s governor.
�People know me as a human being with strengths and weaknesses, flaws and all,� Pierce said at the press conference. �I am I running as a citizen, not as a machine.�
He also noted the incident had �helped my name recognition� with voters.
Brown, who revealed last week that she had been a victim of domestic violence, was unwilling to let Pierce off the hook Thursday. She said his statement had �traumatized� her. She declined to reveal details about her experience, saying only that it was �very painful.�
Voters should decide �if you want someone who spent the weekend learning about this issue, or someone who has spent her whole life� working on problems linked to domestic violence, Brown said.
Pierce pressed Brown on the need for the governor and lawmakers to reform the Public Employee Retirement System to help control the system�s cost. Pierce said he supports changes to how public employees� final salaries are calculated for pension purposes, in order to reduce the practice of �spiking� to inflate retirement benefits. He also wants to lower guaranteed investment returns for workers who retire under the �Money Match� formula.
Ultimately, though, public employees who don�t contribute any part of their paychecks to their retirement costs need to start doing so, Pierce added. �Over time, some money is going to have to be in there from the employees,� he said.
Brown said she was only open to PERS changes that are �legally viable.� But, she added, �when I hear (Pierce�s) proposals, I hear lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit ... back on the hamster wheel,� referring to previous reforms that were ruled illegal.
Asked whether for-profit companies should be allowed to run the coordinated care organizations, which distribute Medicaid dollars to low-income Oregonians, Brown was the only candidate to say no. The issue has surfaced after it was revealed that the sale of for-profit Trillium, Lane County�s CCO, netted a handful of shareholders millions of dollars.
Brown said she was troubled by that news and her office �is taking a look at and thinking about� whether for-profit companies should run CCOs.
�My primary focus is making sure that all Oregonians have access to health care,� she added.
Thomason, meanwhile, said he opposes Measure 97 and would like to raise funding for government services in Oregon with a sales tax, coupled with tax cuts in other areas. �If we ever want tuition-free colleges or single-payer health insurance, we need to do that,� he said.
Asked why he thinks that approach, which has been voted down by Oregonians several times before, might now work, Thomason responded: �Because I�m asking them.�

Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bars
There is no easier way to get your kids to help in the kitchen than to pull out a bag of chocolate chips. Am I right? The highlights of childhood baking are as follows: eating chocolate chips straight from the bag and licking the beaters.These pumpkin chocolate chip bars have been on the blog before, but they are so incredibly good and so incredibly perfect for fall that they needed a repeat.The bars are cake-y, spicy, and studded with chocolate chips. They'll rock your bake sale, lunchbox, picnic...I promise.2 cups unbleached, all purpose flour (we substituted 1 cup for white whole wheat)1 & 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon3/4 teaspoon ginger1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg1/8 teaspoon allspice1/8 teaspoon cloves1 teaspoon baking soda3/4 teaspoon kosher salt1 cup (2 sticks) butter1 & 1/4 cup sugar1 egg2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract)1 cup canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)12 oz. semisweet chocolate chipsPreheat oven to 350. Line a 13x 9" pan with foil.Whisk together the flour, spices, salt and baking soda. Set aside.Cream together the butter and sugar until smooth and fluffy. Add in the egg and vanilla and beat until well combined, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the pumpkin.On low speed, add in the flour mixture in two additions, mixing just until combined.Stir in the chocolate chips.Spread the batter into the prepared pan, an offset spatula is great for this. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out with loose crumbs, but not wet.Cool completely on a wire rack. To cut, lift the foil from the pan. Use a bench scraper to cut into bars.Yep....they're good. And, with a cup of pumpkin in the mix, they're practically health food.Make them with your kids, or grandkids (or by yourself), you'll be happy you did!
The Birds have some serious bucks remaining in cap space. According to Pro Football Talk's team-by-team cap space breakdown, the Eagles have the fifth most room in the NFL. At $26.3 million, the Eagles could buy Antonio Dixon quite a few hamburgers or add depth to the roster at any point this offseason. While most would agree that the team should build through the draft, the extra dollars could come in handy for a late-offseason trade or help the team add some young veterans to the mix on the offensive and defensive lines.
As I mentioned this past weekend, there is still quite a bit of talent on the streets. Keep in mind, guys like Alan Branch and Karlos Dansby have years of 4-3 Under experience and offensive tackles like Eric Winston and Andre Smith are still on the market. Then again, you could also make a case that the reason those guys are on the market is because teams are not willing to meet their price demands. That would be pretty telling, considering 11 teams have more than $13 million in cap space.
Howie Roseman is known for surprising us when we least expect it (as I have dubbed it the Nnamdi Silence), so the cap space should keep us on our toes until kickoff in the Fall. Could there be a trade in the future? Could it be a player at a key need? Or could it do wonders for the Eagles if the team has a major offseason or in-season injury?
No matter which way it turns out, you have to feel good about the state of the team's cap. Say what you want about Howie or even Tom Heckert, but when was the last time the Eagles ever had to fight to get under the cap? That's pretty remarkable for a team that has only been under .500 twice in the last decade.
They missed the specific reason for the protest of CNN, CNN's fake focus group favoritism to Clinton.
Via Los Angeles Daily News:
One person was taken into custody Monday evening during a pro-Donald Trump rally outside the CNN building in Hollywood. But it wasn't a Trump supporter who was taken away in handcuffs by Los Angeles police, it was a woman who allegedly spat on one of the demonstrators, then dashed into a nearby coffee shop.
“The woman that they're arresting right now spit on me. I had another gentleman spit in my face,” said Margaret Schofield as she carried a “Chino for Trump” sign.
The female suspect was being held on a battery count, a spokesman with the Los Angeles Police Department said.
The protesters gathered at the corner of Sunset and Cahuenga boulevards to speak out against what they perceive as pro-Hillary Clinton media bias and to demand CNN “be more truthful” in its coverage of the 2016 presidential election.
“The things that I see on CNN, it really is beyond bias and slant,” said Dorothy Caruso of Costa Mesa. “It's the Clinton News Network.”
While Caruso stood to the west of the CNN building, she said she was confronted by someone who obviously isn't a Trump supporter.
“Somebody had a temper tantrum, abused my Women for Trump sign,” said Caruso as she held up a homemade poster that had been torn apart.

Trump: Working with China on North Korea 'has not worked out' 5:53 PM ET Tue, 20 June 2017 | 00:40
President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that China "tried" to help the United States curb North Korean aggression but it "has not worked out."
It is not clear if Trump's statement signals any change in policy toward China or North Korea.
The tweet comes one day after 22-year-old Otto Warmbier — whom North Korea held for more than a year — died following his return to the United States. Earlier Tuesday, Trump called Warmbier's treatment a "disgrace" and said it could have been avoided if he was brought home earlier.
Trump has tried to leverage China, North Korea's only major ally, to apply more economic pressure on Pyongyang to help stop its nuclear and missile programs and other acts of defiance against the U.S. and its allies. Shortly before the president tweeted, press secretary Sean Spicer said the White House has seen "positive movement" from China and will "continue to work with them and others to put the appropriate pressure on North Korea."
Trump has previously said he sought a diplomatic solution to rein in North Korea.
"We'd love to solve things diplomatically but it's very difficult," he told Reuters in late April.
In the same interview, Trump said, "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea."
Goods and Services Tax +
The new tax rates would affect everything +
The GST () Council on Friday finalised tax rates for services. Education and healthcare have been exempted from the GST regime "India has finalised four tax rates that will apply to services including telecoms, insurance, hotels and restaurants under a new sales tax which should be rolled out on July 1," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.The tax rates will be 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent - in line with those applying to goods. Telecoms and financial services will be taxed at a standard rate of 18% while transport services will be taxed at 5%, Jaitley told reporters after a meeting of the GST Council in Srinagar.The tax rate on gold has not been finalised yet and the Council will meet again on June 3.from your restaurant visits, movie dates, visits to the salon and even your phone bills. Rail, air and road transport will fall in the 5 percent tax slab. Non air-conditioned restaurants will attract a tax levy of 12 per cent whereas air-conditioned restaurants will fall in the 18 per cent tax bracket. Hotels with tariff between Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 will attract a GST of 18 per cent, whereas hotels with tariff of above Rs 5,000 will fall under the 28 per cent tax slab. However, hotels with tariff under Rs 1,000 are exempt from the GST regime."Services, which are at currently taxed 15 per cent will be fitted into the 18 per cent bracket. However, services will get the benefit of input tax credit for the goods used, so real incidence of taxation will be lower than the headline rate," Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said after the GST council meeting. " Luxury services " would attract the highest rate of 28 per cent, he added.The Council on Thursday approved the tax rates for 1,211 items, of which 7 per cent will be exempted, 14 per cent will be in the 5 per cent slab, 17 per cent in the 12 per cent category, 43 per cent in the 18 per cent segment, while 19 per cent of goods will go into the top tax bracket of 28 per cent."Telecom services would continue to be taxed at the same rates of the past. Not in a single case has there been an increase in taxes from before," the Kerala finance minister said.81 per cent items will attract tax of 18 per cent or below, while 19 per cent of items will be taxed at the highest rate of 28 per cent.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley yesterday said that while the overall basket of taxes will see a reduction, he hoped for greater tax buoyancy because of greater efficiency and less tax evasion."On many commodities there would be reduction because of the cascading effect, but we are banking on the hope that because of a better tax system and less evasion there would be tax buoyancy," Jaitley said.The rate for capital goods, as well as industrial and intermediate items have been set at 18 per cent.The government aims to roll out GST from July 1. It is expected to add 2 per cent to the country's GDP or gross domestic product."The net effect of Goods and Services Tax will not be inflationary," Jaitley said on Friday after the GST meeting. The new tax is likely to be non-inflationary as the government has kept a majority of food items, with a combined weighting of nearly 50 per cent in the consumer price index, out of the tax net.Basic food items like cereals, eggs and meat will attract zero tax while processed food items will be charged between 12 and 28 per cent.The long-awaited GST has been hailed as India's biggest tax overhaul since Independence in 1947. "GST regime will usher in lower taxes, seamless input tax credit, logistics savings and market share swings from unorganised to organised players," said Aditya Narain, Research head at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who completes three years of his term this month, had said the new tax will not cause price rises, while aiming to bring down tax leakages in the complex tax system.(With agency inputs)
(This story appears in Wednesday's edition of USA TODAY.)
With the loss of UFC 161's planned headliner between Renan Barao (30-1 MMA, 5-0 UFC) and Eddie Wineland (20-8-1 MMA, 2-2 UFC), Ultimate Fighting Championship officials looked to add some firepower to the event's lineup. Roy Nelson (19-7 MMA, 6-3 UFC) and Stipe Miocic (9-1 MMA, 3-1 UFC) answered the call.
USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com) today confirmed with UFC President Dana White that Nelson and Miocic have agreed to meet on the main card of the event, which takes place June 15 at MTS Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Rashad Evans (17-3-1 MMA, 12-3-1 UFC) vs. Dan Henderson (29-9 MMA, 6-3 UFC) now headlines the card.
The planned main event was scratched when Barao suffered torn ligaments in his foot. UFC officials are currently seeking another opponent for Wineland, and if one is secured, the event will feature six fights on the evening's pay-per-view card instead of the traditional five contests.
Nelson, the No. 8-ranked heavyweight in the USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie.com Rankings, enters the fight with an impressive three-fight win streak that includes three first-round knockouts over Cheick Kongo, Matt Mitrione and Dave Herman. The win streak is Nelson's longest since 2008 and has “Big Country” knocking on the door of title contention.
Meanwhile, Miocic recently cracked the USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie.com Rankings' top-15 list. The 30-year-old Ohio native opened his career with nine straight wins, including three UFC victories. He fought most recently in the main event of this past September's “UFC on FUEL TV 5: Struve vs. Miocic” event, where he suffered a TKO loss to Stefan Struve.
Miocic had been expected to face Australian heavyweight Soa Palelei (18-3 MMA, 0-1 UFC), who is now left without an opponent. Palelei will now serve as a backup opponent should any injuries disrupt UFC 161's heavyweight bouts of Nelson vs. Miocic or Pat Barry vs. Shawn Jordan.
For the latest on UFC 161, stay tuned to the UFC Rumors section of the site.

Every month or so I run across another miss-guided designer making a CCG (Collectible Card Game or Trading Card Game). So again, I'm writing a blog so I don't have to repeat myself all the time. Let's be clear, CCG is not a STYLE of play, it's a distribution model. If you just want to make a game where you construct decks to play, then don't call it a CCG.
I've been in this industry a long time… about 20 years now. In that time hundreds of CCGs have been made. Do you know how many CCGs have lasted more than 1 year's time? Maybe a dozen or two tops. You know how many have made any significant money? About half that. How many have lost significant money? Hundreds. There is a reason Magic the Gathering is still the only profitable card game WOTC produces – did you know they had 14 other CCGs? How many can you name besides Pokémon and maybe Star Wars?
In today's hobby gaming world the CCG label is more or less the kiss of death to any game. Even large companies with large marketing budgets with awesome licenses don't make it. Why do you think you have a chance in hell?
– CCG's are very costly to make. Tons of unique art is required and the manufacturing process (with random boosters) is very costly. You will end up printing huge amounts just to get the cost down. Now you're stuck with a bunch of products you need to warehouse. Then there is the unique art that you need to commission for each card which will cost you $100-300 per card. CCG's that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on marketing have still utterly failed – do you have that kind of money? There is a saying, the fastest way to lose a million bucks is to spend it making a CCG in the hobby game industry. Others have before you. Literally.
– Publishers don't like CCG's. If you are attempting to pitch your game to a publisher to let them handle all the business aspects of your game, if they hear the word CCG they will go running fast in the opposite direction. If they don't they'll want you to change it from a CCG to some other distribution format anyway.,
– Backers do not like CCG's. CCG's rarely fund on Kickstarter (or other crowd-funding sites) and if they do it's because someone had an unrealistic goal and probably did it POD (print on demand). There is no quicker way to loose the interest of prospective backers then to tell them they have to buy your game multiple times to play it.
– Distributors do not like CCG's. The distributors were burned back in the 90s with all the MTG clones. They had to eat a ton of debt. They won't even talk to you if you say the word CCG.
– Game Stores do no like CCG's. Stores have and continue to be burned by CCGs over and over. Sure a couple have a good run for a few months. Some regions have some success with one game or another. But overall almost all the retailers I know will not purchase a game that is branded and marketed as a CCG.
– Customers do not like CCG's. The problem with a CCG is that you need critical mass for OP (Organized Play) and they are expensive. Customers don't like having to buy something over and over again (eg. random cards). Most customers who enjoy this kind of competitive format already have a game of choice. They are not going to dump the thousands of dollars they spent on that game to try out yours.
– CCG's are very hard to maintain. Players expect regular updates and releases. Do you have a team large enough to continue to release tested product on a regular basis? How long did it take you to make your current game? You'll not have that time anymore. You'll have just months or people will loose interest. How fast can you work out balancing issues? Oh and you know it takes 90 days to get your product printed and shipped – so you have to launch with the expansion ready to go. Do you have money for that too?
– CCG's require OP (Organized Play). If you're going to push on and make a CCG anyway, be aware that you must have a OP system in place with prize support and TO (Tournament Organizers) and the lot. OP is an integral part to these style of games to drive continued purchasing and trading.
Ask yourself why? Why will your game succeed as a CCG when so many others have failed? Other games have had great mechanics. Other games have had great art. Other games have had great characters and story. Other games have had huge licenses. Yet the vast majority have failed. WOTC (Wizards of the Coast) who has all the money, knowledge, and power behind it has had many failed CCG's. FFG (Fantasy Flight Games) is one of the top 3 game companies in our industry, yet they gave up on CCG's over 5 years ago. AEG (Alderac Entertainment Group) doesn't release new games as CCG's any more even though they have the 2nd oldest CCG maker in the industry. These are smart people and good companies.
So what do you do? Ever hear of the LCG (Living Card Game)? Ever hear of Dominion? Well these are two models that work well these days. The LCG name/brand is trademarked so you can't use it, but the format is simple enough to mimic. You release a regular small static set of cards on a regular basis that people can use to augment their constructed decks. Sometimes called a ECG or XCG (Expandable Card Game). Dominion does this, just that it does it in large releases. Releasing their game in a board game box makes people assume a higher value due to the packaging and form factor.
If you feel your game needs the “deck construction” aspects of the format, then you really should try something other then rarity (which really doesn't work anyway as people just get deck lists and buy singles) to make that work. Make sure your game/cards have multiple valid winning strategies so everyone isn't playing the same deck. You can try assigning values to each card and allowing only a certain point total for your whole deck- this works with most miniatures games. Etc.
Another option is to take your game digital. But I would strongly argue that a great game in an online space is not the same as a great game on the table top. Take Shadow Era as an example, but there are many more. Go one way or the other then after your successful you can consider other options. WOW (World of Warcraft) card game is no longer being made as Cryptizoic and Blizzard both go to the digital format. Then there is SolForge from the designer of MTG which also is digital only.
I know every designer likes to think their game is unique and special and has a chance… well I bet you can say the same for most musicians out there. But how many actually become rock stars? I'm here to try to inject a bit of reality. Hopefully people will love your game – but the only realistic chance you have to find out is if you use a different distribution model then a CCG/TCG.
Best of luck and happy designing!
James

It saddens me to watch my successor as minister of Foreign Affairs, Stéphane Dion, attacked and criticized over the sale to Saudi Arabia of light armoured vehicles manufactured in London, Ontario.
The minister and his colleagues are, of course, right to say that the sale was negotiated and approved before they assumed office. The fact that the minister's signature was required on the final export permits in no way contradicts the reality that to have refused to sign those permits would have breached a contract previously entered into by the Government of Canada.
If I sign an agreement to sell my house, the transaction is not completed until the day I sign the papers transferring ownership of the property to the buyer. But if I refuse to do the latter, I am clearly in breach of my prior agreement.
Beyond the contractual obligation, there are plenty of reasons to support the sale of these light armoured vehicles.
First, the defence industry is a key driver of economic activity and an important source of high-value employment. The sector encompasses more than 650 firms, supports more than 65,000 full-time jobs across the country and contributes an estimated $6 billion a year to our country's GDP. Exports account for half of Canada's total defence industry revenues.
Some people would prefer that we not be in the arms business at all. But not only does this industry supply some of our own defence and security requirements, it supplies our allies as well.
Should we adopt a policy of refusing to trade with people whose values are out of line with our own? Regrettably, that might leave us with a rather limited number of potential customers. Should we adopt a policy of refusing to trade with people whose values are out of line with our own? Regrettably, that might leave us with a rather limited number of potential customers.
Whether one believes that Canada should offer its forces only in support of peacekeeping (a view I don't happen to share), or should play a more robust role in global affairs, our armed forces plainly need vehicles, uniforms and ordinance to carry out their duties.
Given that requirement, it stands to reason that Canadians should want to design and manufacture this equipment — and if we're doing so, the economics of scale dictate exporting those same products.
Second, Canada has long had interests in the region. Our armed forces have served there. Some 23 fallen Canadian soldiers and peacekeepers are buried in the Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery near Gaza City.
It's often said that countries don't have friends — they have interests. Canada has an obvious interest in stability in a region in which regime change has, to say the least, not gone well in recent years. A strong Saudi Arabia, balancing Iran and its regional allies, is not a bad thing. Conversely, if you dislike the current government of Saudi Arabia (and there are good reasons to do so), you had better ask yourself who and what might replace it.
Third, as a mature country, we have to be able to deal with governments and regimes with which we do not always agree. The world is full of countries that do not share our values and beliefs. Should we adopt a policy of refusing to trade with people whose values are out of line with our own? Regrettably, that might leave us with a rather limited number of potential customers.
Canada, it should be pointed out, is not supplying the Saudis with equipment that can be used in torture or persecution of women. We are selling military vehicles — basically fancy trucks — of the sort that are required by any country's armed forces, and which we happen to be good at making.
Finally, I find myself wondering whether the people who are now loudly proclaiming that we should block the sale of military vehicles to the Saudis are being equally vigorous in their support of a pipeline from Alberta to the East Coast — a pipeline that would reduce and perhaps end our dependence on oil imports from that same country. Somehow, I doubt it.
In my judgement, selling light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia is good for Canada and Canadian workers, and fully justifiable on moral grounds.

Выводы и итоги.
В документации ГУЛАГа одним из самых распространенных оправданий высокой смертности в 1932–1933 годах остается традиционная для советских ведомств попытка переложить основной груз ответственности с «больной головы на здоровую»: на Главное управление исправительно-трудовых учреждений, заведовавшее тюрьмами, домами заключения и колониями, находившееся в системе Наркомата юстиции.
Например, Ягода в докладной записке на имя Сталина отмечал: «Пополнения лагерей за счет крайне истощенных и нетрудоспособных заключенных из мест лишения свободы НКЮ в первые же месяцы 1933 года резко понизили санитарное состояние лагерей»[i]. Действительно, условия в системах НКЮ были еще более тяжелыми, чем в лагерях и заключенные в домзках и колониях страдали от голода и эпидемий. Однако, как часто бывает в любых ведомственных оправданиях, руководители ГУЛАГа сознательно не упоминали о роли лагерей в деградации физического состояния заключенных и, в конечном итоге — в их гибели.
В 1933 году ГУЛАГом официально была снижена норма пайкового довольствия. Калорийность среднерасчетной нормы в день на одного человека в 1933 году оценивалась в 2196 калорий[ii]. Совершенно очевидно, что данное снижение норм радикально ухудшило и без того тяжелое положение лагерных контингентов.
Пребывая в лагерь из домзаков наркоматов юстиции уже в критическом состоянии, среднестатистический заключенный в 1933 году попадал буквально в патовую ситуацию: вместо того, чтобы попасть в больницу для восстановления сил, его гнали на энергоемкую работу, а в больницу попадали уже совсем больные заключенные- администрации лагеря необходимо было выполнить план любыми способами даже с таким истощенным контингентом.
К тому же заключенный получал пайку, которая была совершенно недостаточна для восстановления энергозатрат, даже при условии ее выдачи в полном объеме. Однако, как видно по документы, положение узников ухудшалось в результате хищений и коррупции в администрации лагеря. И без того скудная официальная пайка(допустим, официальная норма для не выполняющих задания в 1900 кал для котла производственников выглядит очень низкой) в положенных нормах не доходила до заключенного- как мы можем видеть по документам проверки заключенный, не выполняющий норму выработки производственник получал 1445 кал- в условиях сверхэксплуатации и холодного климата(из-за холода организм требует значительно больше калорий), это смерть или по крайней мере инвалидность в течении нескольких месяцев . Именно поэтому за январь-август 1933 года в Осиновском отделении Сиблага "пришло в состояние инвалидности и было освобождено" 681 человек.
Наконец, одна из важнейших причин деградации здоровья лагерников в этот период заключалась в специфической институциональной особенности в принципе формирования пайков в лагерях ОГПУ(до революции этого принципа не существовало): «шкала дифференцированного питания», «законный» способ сокращения и так недостаточного пайка, который играл крайне негативную роль для заключенного. Из-за принципа «дифференцированного питания» в условиях голодной катастрофы 1932–1933 годов истощенные заключенные не могли выполнять производственные нормы, переводились на еще более низкокалорийный паек, что в конечно итоге, приводило или к инвалидности или к гибели. Положение с питанием в лагерях продолжало оставаться напряженным почти все время на протяжении 1930-х годов из-за жестокой экономии на лагерном снабжении, ведь заключенные(вместе со спецпереселенцами) находились на низшей ступеньке иерархии советского общества 1930-х годов.
Более того, выполнение производственных плана у лагерных управленцев находилось практически всегда в абсолютном приоритете даже в условиях полноценной гуманитарной катастрофы- а ситуацию со смертностью в 160 pro mille по Сиблагу можно обоснованно назвать гуманитарной катастрофой.
В случае провала плана и производственного прорыва начальники лагеря могли сами попасть под репрессии и дисциплинарные взыскания. Как правило, здоровье лагерников интересовало администрацию лагерей лишь настолько насколько оно позволяло выполнять производственные и хозяйственные задачи: сверхциничный "индустриальный прагматизм"(термин д.и.н.Е.Осокиной) был вообще характерен для организации строек первых пятилеток, а в лагерном секторе экономики этот прагматизм приобретал совсем уродливые формы, выражаясь в экстремальной сверхсмертности истощенных лагерных заключенных и постоянном(иногда более, иногда менее интенсивным) процессом превращения части наиболее слабых контингентов лагерей в "доходяг" и "инвалидов" .
На примере "гулаговской" специфической методы- дифференцированной шкалы питания - можно очень четко зафиксировать процесс превращения еще не старых людей буквально за несколько месяцев в полных инвалидов, которые начинали умирать с беспрецедентной интенсивностью(15% в год) и ответить на вопрос почему "исключительно плохие жилищно-бытовые условия лагеря грозят имеющемуся наличию трудоспособных лагерников в короткий срок превратить их в больных и инвалидов(с)
Паек от 1400 до 3000 ккал(в редких случаях 3600), температура -15 в бараках зимой, крайняя скученность(1,25 кв.м на человека), тяжелый не механизированный труд в шахтах и на основных производственных работах- все перечисленные факторы в условиях развала снабжения 1932-1933 гг. спровоцировало катастрофу:в Сиблаге в 1933 г. погибло 7736 человек, каждый 6 заключенный от среднегодового среднесписочного состава(16%)[vi]. Чтобы оценить произошедшее в национальном контексте: во всех тюрьмах Российской Империи в 1912 г.(неурожайный и эпидемический год) с учетом Польши умерло 5962 человек, что составило 3,2% от среднегодового числа заключенных Империи[vii].
Закономерным будет вопрос- а как же обстояло дело в питание в другие "стабильные" годы 1930-х? Может, в 1934 г. приняли новые нормы и лагерники стали есть достаточно? На него я постараюсь ответить в следующих постах о питании в ГУЛАГе, которых(я надеюсь) будет еще много. Спасибо за внимание.

WASHINGTON -- The arc of history is moving in the direction of marriage equality, regardless of how the Supreme Court ultimately rules in a case arguing its constitutionality. Just this past week, several senators announced their own evolution on the matter, going from being opposed to same-sex marriage to supportive.
The tide is moving so fast, that in the process of attempting to write a post on the remaining holdouts among Senate Democrats, one of those holdouts, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), put out a statement saying he supported marriage equality.
And so, as of 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday, March 26, the number of Democratic senators who have yet to embrace the right of gay marriage, or whose position is fuzzy by design, stands at 10. Their reasoning varies. Most say they are in the midst of an evolution; some are fine with it being considered on a state-by-state basis; some declined to discuss the matter at all. Their names and explanations (when provided) are below.
1. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) backs civil unions but not gay marriage.
"In the past, Senator Casey has supported civil unions and he is closely following the debate around DOMA. He intends to thoroughly review any legislation on this when it comes before the Senate," said Casey's spokesman John Rizzo.
Asked if the senator supports the repeal of DOMA, Rizzo simply repeated that Casey will review any legislation that comes before the Senate.
2. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) continues to back DOMA, in addition to opposing same-sex marriage.
"Senator Manchin believes that a marriage is a union between one man and one woman. His beliefs are guided by his faith, and he supports the Defense of Marriage Act," said Manchin spokeswoman Katie Longo.
3. Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) has not publicly come out in support of marriage equality, although she did oppose North Carolina's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. In a statement last year, she said it would have "far-reaching negative consequences for our families, our children and our communities." In 2008, Q-Notes also reported that Hagan said she believed the issue should be left up to the states to decide.
4. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) believes marriage is between a man and a woman.
"Sen. Nelson strongly supports civil rights for same-sex couples, while believing marriage should be between a man and a woman," Nelson spokesman Ryan Brown said in a statement. "The issue will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court before the end of the year."
5. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) supported allowing states to decide what to do about marriage but did not take a position beyond that.
"Senator Heitkamp believes this should be handled on a state-by-state basis," said Heitkamp's communications director, Whitney Phillips.
6. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has mostly shied away from discussing gay marriage in public, offering only her support for people's right to "love who they love."
"I feel very strongly that people should be allowed to love who they love, but unfortunately my state has a very strong ban against gay marriage constitutionally, so I'm going to have to think really carefully and listen to the voters of my state about that issue," Landrieu said. "But it's very tough because I think most people believe that people should love who they love."
The Louisiana senator, who is up for reelection in 2014, voted against an amendment in 2006 that would place a constitutional ban of same-sex marriage, even though at the time she defined marriage as "a sacred union between one man and one woman."
7. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) opposes DOMA and co-signed an amicus brief last much that urged the Supreme Court to invalidate Section 3 of that law. But the senator has yet to endorse same-sex marriage as a legal right.
"Sen. Carper was proud to support Delaware's efforts to enact Civil Union legislation and earlier this month he joined 211 of his Congressional colleagues in co-signing the Amicus brief that urges the Supreme Court to invalidate Section 3 of DOMA," his office said in a statement. "He has also said that he would vote to repeal DOMA. He also opposed President Bush's attempt to enact a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman. Like many Americans including Presidents Obama and Clinton, Sen. Carper's views on this issue have evolved, and continue to evolve. He continues to give this issue a great deal of consideration."
8. Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) does not support same-sex marriage.
"He has not changed his position on marriage equality," Johnson's office said. Asked if that meant he does support the right of a gay couple to marry, the office replied: "No."
9. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) opposed same-sex marriage during the campaign. His office said it would send offer a statement of explanation for his current position, though it hadn't done so by the time of publication.
10. Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) does not support same-sex marriage.
"Senator Pryor's position on same-sex marriage has not changed," said his spokeswoman, Lucy Speed. Was that opposed to gay marriage? "Yes," she replied.
In the past few days, Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Mark Warner (D-Va.) Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) all announced that they were supportive of same-sex marriage rights. McCaskill cited religious reasons. Begich was actually reiterating a position he had offered -- much more privately -- a year ago. Warner called laws outlawing same-sex marriage discriminatory and Rockefeller talked about the generational movement toward inclusivity.
"Like so many of my generation, my views on allowing gay couples to marry have been challenged in recent years by a new, more open generation," Rockefeller said in a statement. "Churches and ministers should never have to perform marriages that violate their religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't discriminate against people who want to marry just because of their gender.
“Younger people in West Virginia and even my own children have grown up in a much more equal society and they rightly push us to question old assumptions –- to think deeply about what it means for all Americans to be created equal. This has been a process for me, but at this point I think it's clear that DOMA is discriminatory. I'm against discrimination in all its forms, and I think we can move forward in our progress toward true equality by repealing DOMA and leaving the definition of marriage to the states.”
UPDATE: Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) backed gay marriage on Wednesday as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on DOMA, becoming the latest Democratic senator to express her support.
"I know there are strong feelings on both sides, and I have a great deal of respect for their opinions," Hagan told the News & Observer. "But after much thought and prayer on my part this is where I am today."
Her statement brings the number of Democratic senators who do not publicly back gay marriage down to nine.
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A Russian airstrike killed three Turkish soldiers in northern Syria on Thursday, an attack that both countries described as an accident. Still, it injected new tension into a volatile corner of the Syrian battlefield as new clashes erupted between Turkish-backed rebels and Russian-backed government forces.
Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, apologized in a phone call to his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, calling the deaths a “tragic incident,” according to official accounts from their governments. One Turkish official called it “friendly fire.”
Both countries appeared eager to avoid derailing their new cooperation in Syria, where they have been seeking to lead a new effort to resolve the complex six-year-old conflict, even as they support combatants on opposite sides.
But the incident between Turkey, a NATO member, and Russia, ratcheted up an already risky situation in northern Syria. It came as Syrian rebels fighting alongside Turkish troops clashed in that same area for the first time with pro-government forces working with Russian air cover.
Watford are attempting to seal a transfer deadline day loan deal for Club Brugge striker Obbi Oulare while the Hornets are also still hoping to complete a move for Rennes midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure.
The summer transfer window closes at 6pm this evening and the Golden Boys are busy shaping a squad they believe it capable of holding their own in the Premier League.
Oulare has left Belgium's Under-21 side to travel to England to discuss a switch to Vicarage Road.
It is understood the 19-year-old's move would be a loan deal with the Hornets having the option to buy.
Oulare broke into the Brugge first-team last season and has 37 appearances for the club, scoring eight times.
The Hornets are also hoping to clinch a move for 22-year-old Doucoure before the window closes.
Watford head coach Quique Sanchez Flores has said he wants to bring in another midfielder and the former France Under-21 international fits that bill.
Rennes are believed to want around £7m for Doucoure, who has scored 13 goals in 73 games for Rennes, which could prove a stumbling block.
Striker Victor Ibarbo is also expected at the Hornets' London Colney training ground today to complete his switch from Serie A side Roma.
Meanwhile, Gabriele Angella is set to join Queens Park Rangers on a season-long loan deal while Matej Vydra's future at Watford remains uncertain.
The Czech Republic international will be allowed to leave Vicarage Road but only if the Hornets feel he is surplus to requirements.
Reading and a host of Championship clubs have been linked with moves for Vydra, who hasn't featured for Watford in the Premier League this season.
I came in for the trip, I stayed for the marxism and the discussion about aesthetics. Let's chat with Verena and Jonas Kyrazates about their Lands of Dream . French version here.
What are the Lands of Dream exactly ? You seem to be quite inspired by Dunsany, and your worlds sure are very litterate with a slew of bookish references... But then it's a very special universe. How did the idea come to you ?
Jonas : I guess the Lands of Dream were created somewhere in the intersection between Lord Dunsany and William Blake. It all came together as we were making The Strange and Somewhat Sinister Tale of the House at Desert Bridge, which was concerned with themes of creation and destruction, permanence and impermanence, imagination and corruption. Making that game was a very organic process, and out of it came this rather complex setting which could be described as the world of imagination, under threat by a force that claims to be Reason, but isn't.
The Fabulous Screech
The Land of Dream is transmedia : you also publish children books in the setting. What's the biggest difference for you as creators between a book and an adventure game ?
Jonas : Telling a story in a book is structurally very different to telling one in a game. Games are very much about creating spaces, whereas a book is far more linear. The aesthetics, in terms of writing, are also different, since the text in games tends to be broken up and not always in a specific order, whereas "regular" fiction (whether it's a short story or a novel or a children's book) has to flow right, sentences building on each other in ways that are pleasing and interesting. That said, we've tried to give our children's book a sense of space, of details that can be explored by a curious reader, both in the text and in the images.
"The Fish with no name", l'un des énigmatiques personnages décrits dans The Oneiropolis Compendium
Verena : Creating images for a children's book is much more about telling a story, as opposed to creating spaces. The images have to complement the words and expand on them, making the story come alive in the reader's mind. But, as Jonas said, we tried to create a book that children would want to explore. The structure of the book itself also reinforces that.
A big concern for a game designer is that he has to think of the way the player will approach his work. While playing The Sea Will Claim Everything, I sometime felt a bit lost, because of the dreamlike logic... I managed to progress (I haven't finished the game yet, I'm slow like that) but I had to use a walkthrough at some points. Is it something you tried to mitigate ?
Jonas : I try to make these games as accessible as possible, except when I think it's funny or interesting to make them confusing. They're never difficult for the sake of difficulty. But the truth is that players react in entirely unpredictable ways. Most people say the game is too easy, for example, but some find it very difficult. It may be a matter of taste, or habits, or just neurology. The same part of the game may be unbelievably difficult to one person and ridiculously easy to the next, and the part after that may be the exact opposite.
Jonas, in your short biography you say that you're not interested in concepts like “notgames” and “art games”... I like that, I feel there's a lot of bullshit behind those terms ! Can you expand a little bit on that idea ?
Jonas : I'll begin by saying that I do understand why designers use these terms. There have been times when I've been tempted to just call my work "interactive art" to avoid the people who complain whenever they encounter something unusual. But I intensely dislike the terms "notgames" and "art games" because they tend to imply that games aren't art, i.e. that you need to tag on a qualifier to turn them into art. Much like "literary fiction", these terms redefine art to describe only a very limited cluster of interlinked philosophical and aesthetic directions, while implying that everything else is... well, not art. To me, art is not a goal or an ideology ; I don't set out to create "art" or send a "message". These things are the natural result of the creative process, of reaching (intentionally or not) for the sublime. Art is not a judgement, it's a description. A lot of art is terrible, but that doesn't mean it's not art.
"The Great Catanthrope"
Although they may look childish (which is not an expletive, especially because so few games are intended in good faith for children), your games carry grown up concerns. There's a lot of melancholy in a game like The Sea Will Claim Everything... Where does that come from ?
Jonas : It's just a reflection of the world, I think. We live in a very bittersweet world, so full of horror yet so full of beauty and potential. I don't see how one could tell any kind of story that doesn't somehow reflect that. That feeling is particularly strong in the Lands of Dream games, of course, because they are so concerned with time.
Jonas presents himself as a socialist (yeah !). Do you view yourselves as political artists ? The foreclosure of the cave seems pretty obviously satirical, and I guess with your ties to Greece you must be pretty concerned by the economic situation (Hey, I might be french, I'm concerned too).
Jonas : I dislike the term "political artist" much in the way that I dislike "art games" - I don't think art can be apolitical. The artist belongs to the polis and speaks to the polis, so what the artist produces is inevitably political. Designating a small number of people as "political artists" is how the increasingly disconnected art world has justified its own collaborationism. On the other hand, however, I think American rapper and communist Boots Riley put it best : "A rebellious aesthetic is not an actual revolutionary movement. An aesthetic is always absorbed and used by the class which is in power." Breaking with artistic traditions is not, by itself, a threat to the existing capitalist order.
The Sea Will Claim Everything
This one is more for Verena : the illustrations are gorgeous, and very dream-like. They look like a cross between Claude Ponti and Tommy Ungerer, with a bit of psychedelism thrown in. What are your influences ?
Verena : I would really love to give an answer to this that makes me sound incredibly thoughtful and deep, but as much as I'd like to claim that I was inspired by the likes of van Gogh or Monet, that is just not the case. It's not that there aren't a number of artists that I really admire (van Gogh and Monet amongst them), but I didn't approach the first Lands of Dream game, The Strange and Somewhat Sinister Tale of the House at Desert Bridge, with the conscious thought of "let's make this like that guy's work". Instead we were thinking of making a game that looked a bit like a child's drawing, something that a very talented kindergartener might come up with. All the Lands of Dream games share a very odd... how to call it... flavour. It's both whimsical and thoughtful, sometimes hilarious and sometimes very sad. If a story wants to pull off this sort of emotional 180° turn, then the player needs to really be in it. We thought that using this simple, child-like style might bring the player back to that place when they were four and everything seemed possible. And from then on it's really just a matter of refining both the technique and our idea of what it should look like to arrive at the more detailed, smoother look of The Sea Will Claim Everything. From child's drawing to children's book, basically.
Verena et Jonas
How do you manage to work together as a couple ? Is it a source of tension, or mostly a way to share ideas ?
Verena : There really isn't that much tension, although Jonas sometimes gives me a much-needed kick in the behind when I start feeling like we've worked on a project for about a century and I just want to stop and sleep for a decade or two. Honestly, though : mostly it's a pretty awesome experience because we are always right here, in the same space, which makes it very easy and natural to quickly throw a few ideas around and see where they take us. We also think alike to a certain degree, which sometimes will take us into really crazy territory where one of us has an idea and then the other elaborates on it and so on and so forth until we arrive at the mini-game of "whack the schädel" or a giraffe with an ostrich's head. The process is really quite natural and I think we're doing a fine job of motivating each other.
Jonas : Yeah, it's fairly harmonious. It would be easier if we had a bit more space (our flat is rather small and I'd kill several people for an office to work in) but all in all it's a pretty simple process.
What's the weirdest game you've ever played ?
Jonas : You know, I'm not really weirded out by games that are intentionally strange. Games like Frog Fractions or Space Funeral, though they are very good, don't really strike me as weird. What's really weird is the unintentionally surreal stuff, like Skyrim. Coming out of a beautiful if generic landscape into a village to meet a family composed of Fake Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Swedish Dalek and a child who obviously went to an American boarding school, all while a glitched-out bear dances in the sky... now that is really weird.
Verena : Don't forget the convulsing dragon skeleton that startled the shit out of us.
And it's a beautiful thing to see.
Today Joe once again goes after the Big Lie — the claim that Fannie and Freddie caused the crisis — and drives home the point that the people advancing this story aren't just wrong but are acting with intent, engaged in deliberate deception:
In Wallison's article, he claimed that the charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against six former Fannie and Freddie executives last week prove him right. This is another favorite tactic: He takes a victory lap whenever events cast Fannie and Freddie in a bad light. Rarely, however, has his intellectual dishonesty been on such vivid display. In fact, what the S.E.C.'s allegations show is that the Big Lie is, well, a lie.
Read the whole thing.
Basically, Joe is arriving where I've been since 2000: what's going on in the discussion of economic affairs (and other matters, like justifications for war) isn't just a case where different people look at the same facts but reach different conclusions. Instead, we're looking at a situation in which one side of the debate just isn't interested in the truth, in which alleged scholarship is actually just propaganda.
Saying this, of course, gets you declared “shrill”, denounced as partisan; you're supposed to pretend that we're having a civilized discussion between people with good intentions. And you're supposed to match each attack on Republicans with an attack on Democrats, as if the mendacity were equal on both sides. Sorry, but it isn't. Democrats aren't angels; they're human and sometimes corrupt — but they don't operate a lie machine 24/7 the way modern Republicans do.
Welcome to my world, Joe.
Hong Kong's equality watchdog and lawmakers have raised concerns over a complaint by a hearing-impaired man who spent six days at a psychiatric hospital after police officers and medical staff failed to communicate with him properly.
The 32-year-old man surnamed Liu was taken away by police last November following a quarrel with his mother, HK01 reported. His mother told officers that she was assaulted and that Liu had “mental problems.” Failing to understand Liu's sign language, officers sent the man to Tuen Mun Hospital's emergency unit without seeking a sign language interpreter.
Two days later, doctors at Tuen Mun Hospital sent Liu to Castle Peak Hospital, a psychiatric institution. Liu's confinement was only discovered after his sister received a phone call – three days after Liu's arrest – from Liu's employer saying that Liu had been fired for an unexcused absence from work.
After spending six days at the psychiatric hospital, Liu was discharged with the help of his sister, friend, Chinese medical practitioner and lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung.
‘Effective communication'
A spokesperson for the Hospital Authority New Territories West Cluster said that Liu and his relatives did not seek sign language services during his stay at Tuen Mun Hospital. It said Liu was able to “communicate effectively” through writing with medical staff.
Liu “voluntarily” signed an agreement on December 2 to be transferred to Castle Peak Hospital, and Liu's wife and father also agreed to the arrangement, the spokesperson said. It added that sign language services are generally available at institutions under the Hospital Authority.
At Castle Peak Hospital, a sign language interpreter was arranged to assist doctors in confirming that Liu “fully understood” the content of his written communication with medical staff, the spokesperson said.
‘Lack of sensitivity'
Liu told RTHK through an interpreter on Friday that he did not understand the documents he signed at the hospitals, as he could not comprehend long sentences. He said he felt frightened after the incident, but did not intend to file a complaint to the Equal Opportunities Commission.
Siu Tsan, founder of the NGO “Silence” who assisted with Liu's discharge from Castle Peak Hospital, said Liu's reading ability was equivalent to that of a Primary Four student.
“People with hearing impairment usually have low self-esteem and will sign documents even if they don't understand the content,” he said.
“I found it strange that the hospital said Liu did not seek sign language services. You know he is hearing-impaired, then you should be proactive and offer a language interpreter, rather than ask him if he needs an interpreter,” he added.
“Many people in society and even organisations lack an understanding of [the needs of] people with hearing impairments.”
Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung described the incident as “bizarre” and criticised the series of mistakes made by public institutions.
He said the incident reflected the “lack of sensitivity” towards the needs of hearing-impaired patients among frontline medical workers.
The Equal Opportunities Commission said in a statement that it is “highly concerned” about the incident.
“We urge the person involved to contact us directly and we would do our utmost to provide assistance,” the watchdog said, adding that people with hearing impairment and other forms of disabilities should be given equal access to services and facilities.
“The [Equal Opportunities Commission] hopes relevant departments can follow up on the case as soon as possible, and make improvements if necessary, to prevent similar incidents in the future.”
Correction: A previous headline mistakenly suggested that the police had directly sent Liu to a psychiatric hospital – in fact, he was referred there by Tuen Mun Hospital's emergency unit.
Who says that a tiny home needs to be a miniature house? What about a regular-sized shipping container with windows and a stove?
You've seen them here and there online as personal projects, but alternative dwelling builder Montainer is streamlining the process of refurbishing shipping containers into 192-square-foot living spaces.
The Montana-based company Montainer hopes to take its shipping container prototype to cities that need more affordable housing later this year.
Co-founder Patrick Collins said the Missoula, Montana-based company started a little more than a year ago, picking up the shipping containers from Seattle when the big metal boxes would normally be up for recycling. This week, Montainer unveiled the first prototype, named the Nomad 192, in downtown Missoula. The plan is to eventually take the shipping container to Seattle, Portland and San Francisco.
“We produce them here in Montana, but where the most need for them is in places where housing is expensive,” said Collins. “They can actually be a really good value for people in those cities.”
The liveable shipping containers cost $65,000, which includes installing household amenities like plumbing. The first Nomad 192's are expected to ship out in early 2015.
“We had seen these homes being built all over the world, but normally it had been a one-off construction project, or a do-it-yourself project,” said Collins. “This makes these more available.”
But you can't just buy a piece of land, put a Montainer on it and call it good: The city of Portland requires people who wish to purchase an accessory dwelling unit to complete a permitting process. The ADU must be smaller than the main house whether it's attached or not, and the city has to sign off on the final design.

After selling its longtime downtown storefront earlier this summer, a 60-year-old local deli and wholesale business has sealed the deal for its West End relocation.
Nick's International Foods closed last week on the purchase of its new home at 2413 Westwood Ave.
Manuel Mouris, who owns Nick's with his brother Philip Mourtzakis, purchased the 6,400-square-foot building on Westwood Avenue for $530,000, according to Henrico County records. The space was the previous home of Fabulous Findz, an antiques shop that closed in December 2014.
The brothers sold Nick's current home at 400 W. Broad St. for $1.1 million in late June.
Mouris said the Broad Street deli will close in early October, with plans to reopen on Westwood Avenue later that month. He said they're doing some renovations of the new building themselves.
Nick's will retain its deli and retail/wholesale operations with specialty Mediterranean foods in its new location. It's also considering online sales.
Wilson Flohr of Porter Realty represented Mouris in the purchase of the new location. The deal closed Aug. 21.
Named for Mouris and Mourtzakis' father, Nick's has been serving Richmond since the 1950s. After initially opening on North Sixth Street, it moved to East Marshall Street before settling in its current location in the '80s.
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS 5) – A creative proposal to find homes for needy dogs is facing some strong opposition from an unlikely source, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Beginning in August, the city is set to offer panhandlers up to $75 a week to stop begging and foster problem puppies from city animal shelters until the pups are ready for adoption.

The pilot program is called Wonderful Opportunities for Occupants and Fidos, or WOOF. It's believed to be the first of its kind in the country. The program will pair ten dogs with people living in city housing, allowing the dogs to be socialized.
But PETA claims that the program would put the animals at risk. They issued a statement which read, in part:
“The city is in essence experimenting with the lives of homeless animals and people. Many chronic panhandlers battle with addiction and mental health issues; dogs won't be able to tell us if they were harshly scolded, randomly screamed at, smacked, scruffed, locked in a bathroom or closet, or otherwise mistreated.”
The animal rights organization has even offered to cut a check to the city in the amount of $10,000 to put an end to the pilot program. The amount is equal to the grant which is funding WOOF.
City officials said they will not entertain PETA's offer, and plan to move ahead with WOOF.
“I think there is a tremendous amount of compassion and humanity on the part of individuals that are homeless and I am disappointed that PETA can't tap into that humanity,” said Supervisor Bevan Dufty.

Thousands of Santa Barbara County residents remained under evacuation orders as the Thomas Fire burned a total of 270,000 acres — about 422 square miles — as of Sunday evening, authorities said.
The blaze was 45 percent contained, according to fire officials.
The massive wildfire — which is one of the largest in state history — first started in Ventura County earlier this month, breaking out on the evening of Dec. 4. It spread rapidly, triggering the evacuation of thousands in the county and leaving a trail of destruction as homes were reduced to rubble, power outages went on for days and blankets of smoke and ash could be felt in the air.
Two deaths have been linked to the blaze — a 70-year-old Santa Paula woman and a fallen firefighter from the San Diego area.
As strong Santa Ana winds complicated containment efforts, the fire moved north toward Santa Barbara County this past week, continuing to threaten coastal communities near the county's border with Ventura. On Saturday, many remaining evacuations in Ventura were lifted while residents in the Montecito and Summerland area faced mandatory evacuations.
No changes were made to those evacuations by about 6 a.m. the following morning.
So far it has destroyed 756 single-family homes, with another 189 homes damaged, fire officials said early Sunday morning.
That size inches even closer to the mass of the largest California fire on record — the 300,000-acre Santiago Canyon Fire in 1889. It's even closer in acreage to the 273,000-acre Cedar Fire in 2003, which is the largest blaze on a list dating back to 1932 that Cal Fire officials say is more reliable, the Los Angeles Times reports.
Battling the Thomas Fire has cost more than $123 million as just over 8,500 firefighters continued working to contain it Sunday, officials said.
At the scene of the blaze in Santa Barbara, a firefighter told KTLA that containment efforts went fairly well Saturday night as there were not so-called 'sundowner winds,' which are described by national weather officials as warm, dry offshore winds unique to the Santa Barbara coastline.
"Last night was a good night for us," said Jay Smith of Cal Fire. "We didn't get the sundowner winds ... it helped lay the fire down."
"It definitely is a turning point for us," he said.
While the blaze came a bit under control, an update from fire officials the following morning said a red flag warning will remain in place as high winds and low humidity are expected — conditions which typically spur fire growth.
Thirty-four helicopters, six air tankers and two super scoopers are being used by firefighters to try putting out the flames, officials said.

Coastal communities in Santa Barbara County are of most "concern," fire officials said, with these including the cities of Santa Barbara, Montecito and Summerland as well as areas around Matilija Wilderness, Rose Valley and the Sespe river drainage north of Fillmore.
But the blaze continues to threaten parts of Ventura County near Fillmore, especially as some areas around Los Angeles and Ventura counties are seeing gusts at speeds close to 60 mph.

Meanwhile, the air quality in fire-affected areas of Santa Barbara County ranges from moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as those with a lung condition. In Ventura County, where some coastal areas are still seeing ash-covered cars and buildings, the air quality is worse. It is considered "unhealthy" in cities including Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, Santa Paula and Ojai, according to air pollution officials from the Environmental Protection Agency.

One of my favorite concepts that I've encountered as an activist is the idea of “holding space.”
To break it down further, “holding space” is about making room for certain experiences, feelings, or perspectives to be acknowledged and affirmed that may otherwise be pushed aside or invalidated.
Holding space can be powerful. I'm a big believer in giving people the space to open up – and in doing so, building greater understandings of where someone is coming from. A little affirmation can go a long way in making someone feel whole.
And one thing that I've noticed as a transgender person is that people hold very little space for us.
Society at large has a very particular idea of what the trans experience is – and it doesn't give us room to have honest, real conversations about what we're going through, especially when it contradicts this narrative.
This leads us to struggling internally with some big questions that we're afraid to ask – because in asking them, we're fearful that it undermines our identity or will lead others to question our authenticity.
So today, I want to hold a lot of space for the complicated feelings that sometimes arise when we're coming to accept ourselves as transgender.
Because what we're told is that we're born with a crystal clear understanding of our gender, embark on binary medical transition, and achieve ultimate happiness and certainty. Right? But what I know from experience is that, for many of us, it's much more complex than that.
So let's talk – and I mean really talk – about some of the questions many transgender people are thinking about, but might be afraid to ask. And together, let's hold space for all of the complicated feelings that arise as we explore them.
1. Am I Really Trans? What If I'm Making This Up?
Confession: I ask myself this a lot.
“Wait, Sam,” you might be saying. “You write publicly about your identity! You're active in the community! You're even taking hormones! And you mean to tell me that you're unsure if you're trans?”
Yes, that's precisely what I'm saying.
In fact, I can assure you from firsthand experience that many, many transgender people grapple with this question – even years into their transition.
And I have some theories as to why, too – if it helps.
If someone told you your whole life that you were a terrible dancer and suddenly you received a first prize trophy for a dance competition, you'd probably feel like an imposter, right? Similarly, when society tells us we're cisgender (and that being cis is the only option), it can take years and years before we feel secure in ourselves as trans.
Not only that, but trans people are often called into question for not being “trans enough,” are accused of “faking it” for dubious reasons, and are met with disbelief when we first come out.
There's this culture of interrogation around transness – namely, that trans people have to prove that they're trans (to get respect, to get healthcare, to find support).
We constantly have our validity called into question by cis and trans people alike. It leads us to internalize this voice of doubt and to intensely question ourselves as society at large does to us.
Feeling invalid or like an imposter is actually a totally normal thing to feel as transgender. It can be difficult to believe in ourselves when people seldom believe in us.
Getting past that hurdle can take time (look at me, I'm still trying), but it's good to keep this in perspective and remember that feeling this way does not undermine who you are or make you any less “trans” than someone else.
2. Is It Okay If I Wasn't Always Like This?
The short answer: YES! That's absolutely okay!
Unless you screamed “I'm queer and I'm here!” as you exited the womb, it seems like society is dissatisfied with trans people when they come into consciousness at a later age (it's actually a double-edged sword: we're too young to actually know, or we're too old and we're supposed to know sooner – we can't win!).
The dominant narrative says that transgender people are expected to have always known – on some deep, intrinsic level – that we were destined to identify with a gender other than what we were assigned at birth.
But we all have reasons for when we came to terms with being transgender.
For me, it was trauma that delayed my realizations around my gender. For others, they didn't know “transgender” was even a thing and never thought to question their assigned gender. And for some, their safety was at stake if they tried to explore their gender.
Whatever the reason, people come to terms with being trans at different places in their lives.
And there's no “right time” or “correct way” to arrive at that conclusion – whenever you discovered your gender identity, you are completely valid, and it doesn't mean you are more or less trans.
Identity in general is very complex – and everyone, trans or otherwise, will grow and learn about themselves at their own pace. Figuring out who we are doesn't happen in a day. It's okay to take your time.
Instead of viewing it as a race in which other trans people are your competitors, try viewing it as a journey that is for you and you alone. It's my hope that the trans community will be beside you, cheering you on.
3. What If I Regret My Medical Transition?
So it's important to first say that not all transgender people will medically transition. That's a completely valid choice; medical interventions do not make someone more or less trans.
But for those of us who do pursue some form of medical transition, it's unbelievably common to worry about regret.
Because our validity as trans people is always coming under fire, it doesn't surprise me that we question our choices – especially when these choices involve some form of permanent or semi-permanent change.
Lots of transgender people worry about transition regret for different reasons.
For some, they may not feel ready to make such a big change because of other issues they're grappling with. They may not feel prepared to come out to family, which medical transition can require (showing up to a family reunion with a deeper voice and beard without forewarning is apparently frowned upon).

Catching a concert with Elgar
Edward Elgar (Tully Potter Collection)
Gramophone, May 1935, by Compton Mackenzie
One Saturday afternoon in the old Savile Club at 107 Piccadilly, some 10 years ago, I had been sitting next to Elgar at lunch and he had been assuring me with a good deal of emphasis that he no longer took the slightest interest in music. We had moved to the billiard room after lunch and had been discussing the pleasures of the microscope. Presently WJ Turner, who was at the other end of the long settee, got up to leave the club and happened to observe to his neighbour that he was going to Queen's Hall to hear Symphonie fantastique. That may have been the beginning of WJ Turner's devotion to Berlioz which culminated recently in that fine life and study of the composer's work. As the door of the billiard room swung to behind Turner, Elgar turned sharply to me, 'Where did he say he was going?'
I told him, and he asked me if I had ever heard Symphonie fantastique.
'No.'
'You ought to hear that. Of course, a good deal of it may not be of much account, but that march to the gallows is one of the most tremendous things in music. Look here, go to the porter and tell him to telephone through to Queen's Hall for a couple of seats for me, and I'll take you.'
We left the club at 10 minutes to three, took a taxi to Queen's Hall, and while Elgar was waiting in the vestibule I went over to the box-office to get the seats.
'I think you have two seats for Sir Edward Elgar?'
'24 shillings,' said the clerk.
'But they are for Sir Edward Elgar,' I reminded him.
He looked at me blankly, and repeated the price. Not liking to tell Elgar that his name was apparently unknown to the box-office clerk, I paid for the seats myself. I remember being particularly struck by the clerk's crassness, because as it happened the vestibule was full of bills announcing a forthcoming Elgar concert at which the composer was to conduct.
Our seats were in the fourth row of the grand circle on the right-hand side. I do not remember who the conductor was that afternoon, but the concert opened with Strauss's Don Juan, by which Elgar seemed bored. When the Symphonie fantastique began, however, he sat up and took notice, and by the time the march to the gallows had been reached he was sweating profusely and muttering to himself, 'Oh, my God! my God!' so loudly once or twice that some serious-minded young women in front of us turned round and hushed him.
'Now, Mackenzie,' he said, when the march began, 'I am going to mark the rhythm for you on your knee.'
As a matter of fact he marked it on my knee, my ribs, and on the arm of the stall, sweating more and more and mopping his forehead with a large handkerchief. Then he got worried by the way the cymbals were being played.
'Not like that!' he exclaimed, clapping his hands in the style of the cymbalist. 'Like this, you fool!' putting his left arm over his right and playing on my right thigh the cymbals as he wanted them played. By this time most of the people in front were turning round to glare at us and hushes came from all along the line.
At the end of the march there is a sudden stillness, and then the motto theme is played on a solo clarinet which is cut short by the fall of the knife of the guillotine. I think the clarinet player must suddenly have caught sight of Elgar and recognised him, for the expression on his face as he played that brief solo was that of a man who was about to be executed himself. Then the crashing separate chords marked the end. Elgar, still mopping his brow, rose.
'You are not going to wait and hear Rachmaninov play his concerto?'
'No, no, no. I told you that I do not take the least interest in music now.'
With this he plunged out up the stairs of the circle, followed by the indignant glances of the serious-minded young women, as the Witches' Sabbath began.

The then Chinese deputy foreign minister Qiao Guanhua(L) and Huang Hua(R), a then Chinese diplomat, laugh on the news that the UN General Assembly had passed Resolution 2758, recongnizing Chinese mainland as the only Chinese representative in the UN.[Photo: jconline.cn] Today marks the 45th anniversary since People's Republic of China took up its seat at the United Nations and became a membership of the UN Security Council. Since then China's contribution to the UN has won praise and recognition at home and abroad. CRI's Ding Heng reports. 1025chinaun.mp3 The UN General Assembly voted to pass a resolution on October 25th, 1971, recognizing the Chinese mainland as the only legitimate representative of China to the UN. At the same time, the resolution expelled representatives from Taiwan, which had been representing China for some 25 years by then. Chinese deputy foreign minister Li Baodong says the move was significant not only for China, but for the UN as well.
"The resolution opened up a new chapter in China's cooperation with the UN. After that, the UN became an international institution with paramount authority, and it started to represent the widest range of interests. As was pointed out by the resolution itself, the restoration of the lawful status of People's Republic of China in the UN was an indispensable step when it comes to preserving the integrity of the UN Charter, as well as pushing forward UN causes." Over the past four decades, China has lifted more than 700-million people out of poverty, accounting for some 70-percent of the world's total. More than 30-thousand Chinese soldiers have been deployed to UN peacekeeping missions across the world since 1990, with more than 10 losing their lives while on duty. The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including 17 development goals for human society, was passed by world leaders attending a UN summit last September. Zhang Dan, vice president of UN Association of China, a Chinese organization focusing on the China-UN ties, says China is perhaps more committed than anyone else to the agenda. "China played a core role in the designing of the agenda. For instance, poverty alleviation, which is stated as the first goal in the agenda, has always been China's priority. There are many other goals where you can see Chinese influence. Actually, all goals in the agenda bear many similarities with China's own 13th five-year plan for social and economic development. So long as China sticks to its own plan, it will end up contributing significantly to the 2030 agenda." Jeffrey Feltman, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, echoed Zhang's words.
"The agenda's implementation requires robust political leadership, which China has already shown. It was China's championship of sustainable development that solves the G20 adopt an action plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The first time that sustainable development was incorporated into the G20 growth agenda." Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said peace and development are the themes of today's world as early as the 1980s. In one editorial commemorating the day 45 years ago, People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, says the country will remain committed to these two themes. For CRI, this is Ding Heng.

Some progressives are disappointed that the Democratic Party's "Better Deal" agenda for the 2018 midterms doesn't go the Full Bernie. Sure, the Democrats are proposing a minimum wage hike and anti-trust reforms. But there's no single-payer health care or free college tuition to be found.
Still, "Better Deal" suggests that centrist, pro-business Clintonites are in full retreat. The party now seems to take seriously the idea that unadulterated corporate power is badly hurting the U.S. economy and American workers. "We will crack down on monopolies and the concentration of economic power that has led to higher prices for consumers, workers, and small business — and make sure Wall Street never endangers Main Street again," the party promised in its new policy proposal.
Democrats even named names! Among the sectors the party sees as lacking competitiveness and accountability — and thus perhaps ripe for anti-trust or other regulatory action — are the airlines, cable and telecommunications, the beer industry, agriculture, and eyeglasses.
But rather curiously, there was no mention of Silicon Valley.
There was not a word about the giant platform companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google-parent Alphabet, each of which dominate various market segments, such as e-commerce, cloud hosting, search, and mobile traffic. Those three companies, along with Microsoft and Apple, have a total stock market capitalization approaching $3 trillion — versus roughly $150 billion for all the brewing companies combined. Indeed, the four largest American companies by market capitalization are all tech companies: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. If Democrats want to protect Americans from companies with a "concentration of economic power," shouldn't they start in Silicon Valley?
After all, "Better Deal" is supposed to be a relevant, forward-looking agenda that tackles modern economic challenges in a substantial and serious manner. Look at it this way: The Economist recently ran a long analysis arguing that just as oil was key to 20th-century economies, data is the critical "natural resource" in the 21st century. Companies that have a strong grip on data merit close government scrutiny, no?
If Democrats are arguing that corporate concentration is a core economic issue, don't they have to start in the tech sector? And if they're not going to go there, don't they have to explain why not?
What's more, the Democratic Party is conveniently ignoring the tech sector at the same time that many on the left are raising warning flags. Last year, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) compared Amazon, Apple, and Google to Wall Street's "too big to fail" megabanks. And just this week, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) — like Warren, a possible 2020 presidential candidate — said the U.S. government should more closely monitor the growing size of Amazon, Google, and other tech giants. And those are just the politicians. Activist types are more than ready to regulate or dismantle these "digital monopolies."
Given all that, the agenda's only real mention of the tech sector seems weirdly minimalist​: "In an increasingly data-driven society, merger standards must explicitly consider the ways in which control of consumer data can be used to stifle competition or jeopardize consumer privacy.​"​ ​Pretty technocratic. At worst, it's a gentle nudge to the sector that it needs to think hard about the political ramifications of its size and influence.
​For now, though this is a problem for Democrats. They look like hypocrites going after the airlines and telecoms but not big tech companies. And to understand why, you just have to follow the money.
The tech sector is a major supporter of the Democratic Party, both financially and through technical support. According to CrowdPac, 99 percent of Silicon Valley campaign donations went to Hillary Clinton last year. The Democratic presidential nominee also received the public support of many top tech execs. It's one thing for this or that politician to play populist in front of the cameras, but quite another for the Democratic Party to make anti-tech populism part of its official agenda.
But it's hard to take the Democrats' anti-monopoly agenda seriously if they're going after Big Beer but not Big Tech. And if Democrats aren't going to break up the big banks — something that would probably be popular with voters — what is the chance they would really go after companies that are actually popular with Americans?
Democrats are surely smart enough to realize that it's premature, at best, to bring Washington regulators and trust busters down on a sector that has been the only bright spot in the U.S. economy for more than a decade. Despite its size and success, Big Tech remains a tremendous source of innovation-driven productivity for an economy that could use even more "creative disruption."'
Sure, they're massive companies — but mostly because that's how economics interacts with technology. The nature of the internet economy, argues a new Goldman Sachs report, has allowed "a small number of' 'superstar' firms to widen their productivity advantage, tap into network effects, and gain disproportionately large market shares."'
Oh, and they also provide huge value to consumers who treat these digital services as irreplaceable parts of their lives. Let's see if the politicians can provide a better deal than that.
The parents of a 5-year-old boy in Modesto are upset their son was suspended for a day after refusing to take off his backpack.
Jackson Riley had told his teacher there was a bomb inside his backpack.
Jackson's school, Great Valley Charter School, sent his parents a letter saying he was suspended for his intent to "threaten, intimidate or harass others."
STUDENT'S HUNGER STRIKE ENDS AS PROFESSOR ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS PUT ON LEAVE
School administrators later changed the letter to apply to a school code saying he made terrorist threats, but that code only applies to students in the fourth through 12th grades.
Jackson's parents argue he's just 5 years old and was just playing around. They say they don't want anything on their child's file saying he was suspended for making terrorist threats.
The school declined to comment Tuesday.

Posted by: Snow Leopard Trust, a Woodland Park Zoo Partner for Wildlife Through a new, innovative conservation program piloted by Seattle-based Snow Leopard Trust, Woodland Park Zoo, Snow Leopard Foundation Kyrgyzstan and the Kyrgyz Department of Hunting and Natural Resource Management, the 100 square mile area of Shamsy in Kyrgyzstan's northern Tian Shan mountains was converted from a hunting concession to a co-managed nature reserve in 2015. Shamsy is home to ibex and seasonal populations of argali and wolves. It lies within a large snow leopard landscape, and has the potential to become a key part of the home ranges of several of these endangered cats if its wild ungulate population can be increased.“It took vision and gumption from the Kyrgyzstan government, Snow Leopard Trust and local community to take on the co-management of a former hunting concession as a nature reserve. This kind of innovative strategy is exactly what is needed to secure additional habitat for wildlife,” said Fred Koontz, PhD, vice president of field conservation at Woodland Park Zoo. “We are delighted to be partnering on this project—and I suspect that the snow leopards are also!”“We knew that this area had great potential as a snow leopard habitat. We've partnered with the government to establish and manage the Shamshy Wildlife Sanctuary when the opportunity presented itself,” says Kuban Jumabai uulu, director of the Snow Leopard Foundation Kyrgyzstan, and country program manager for the Snow Leopard Trust. “Earlier this year, we had found snow leopard tracks and scratch marks on several ridgelines in Shamshy. Now, these pictures prove the cat's presence in the Sanctuary.”Snow leopards were photographed at five different locations within Shamshy Sanctuary in a total of 10 encounters. The photos are the first photographic evidence of snow leopards in the Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range (“Snowy Mountains” in Kyrgyz), a mountain range that is part of the North Tian Shan Mountains and extends some 200 miles from east to west.The cameras had been set up by the Sanctuary's three rangers and a team of volunteers from India, following a study design and training from Snow Leopard Trust scientists.The snow leopard photos are not only evidence of this cat's presence in the Kyrgyz Ala-Too range, but are also an encouraging sign for an innovative new conservation approach that is being tested in Shamshy: the co-management of a former hunting concession as a nature reserve by conservationists, the government and the local community.Commercial big game hunting, often referred to as “trophy hunting,” is both a tradition and a revenue source for many countries around the world, and a hotly debated topic in conservation circles. The practice usually involves governments or private landowners renting certain areas—sometimes termed ”concessions”— to hunting companies, who then sell licenses to shoot specific species such as ibex or argali to hunters—often foreigners.Shamshy, some 50 miles southeast of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan's capital, used to be such a hunting concession under the administration of the Kyrgyz government's Department of Rational Use of Natural Resources (formerly the Hunting Department).“It is our duty to manage the natural resources of the Kyrgyz Republic sustainably,” says Musaev Almaz, the Department's director. “This means finding a healthy balance between exploitation and conservation. This initiative in Shamshy is one such effort towards conserving wildlife populations through alternate models of managing natural areas through co-management.”As part of the agreement, Almaz's Department has forfeited the cost of the hunting licenses for ibex that could have been sold in this area had it been rented out to a commercial outfit.The Snow Leopard Trust and Snow Leopard Foundation Kyrgyzstan have in turn agreed to prepare a management plan with community based approach for conservation in the area and also monitor trends in its wildlife populations over the next years.On its own, the area is too small to host a sizable snow leopard population, but it could serve as a core zone of a larger habitat. “With proper protection and management, Shamshy's ibex population could double or even triple in the next 10 years, so it could become an important area for the snow leopard population of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range,” says Charu Mishra, the Snow Leopard Trust's science and conservation director.“We're thrilled to see that the snow leopard is already there in Shamshy,” Almaz says. “This cat is an important part of our national culture and heritage, and we're committed to securing its future.”The Kyrgyz Republic has indeed taken on a key role in the worldwide effort to protect the snow leopard. Under the leadership of President Almazbek Atambaev, the Central Asian nation brought all 12 snow leopard range countries to the table for the first-ever Global Snow Leopard Conservation Forum held in Bishkek in 2013. This initiative has resulted in the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Plan, an ambitious program with a goal to secure 23 snow leopard landscapes across the cat's range by 2020.Under this plan, various conservation initiatives are being piloted. Co-management of reserves and protected areas to improve availability of critical wildlife habitats and conservation education is one of them.In 2017, President Atambaev will host a Global Summit on Snow Leopard Conservation to further move this plan forward.
We have recently disclosed a new vulnerability to the Android Security Team. The vulnerability affected many apps, including Settings (the one that is found on every Android device), Gmail, Google Now, DropBox and Evernote. To be more accurate, any App which extended the PreferenceActivity class using an exported activity was automatically vulnerable. A patch has been provided in Android KitKat. If you wondered why your code is now broken, it is due to the Android KitKat patch which requires applications to override the new method, PreferenceActivity.isValidFragment, which has been added to the Android Framework.
In this blog post we will begin with a short introduction on Android and its sandbox, and then we will deep-dive into the vulnerability itself. For the sake of simplicity we omitted some of the details which can be found in our whitepaper.
The UI building blocks of Android Apps
The UI of Android apps is made of activities. An Activity provides a single screen with some functionality (for instance: a browser's bookmarks manager). A Fragment can be considered as a sub-activity. It is a piece of the App's UI. Fragments provide some flexibility as they allow reuse in different activities. While a Fragment instance is coupled with the Activity it resides inside, different instances can be embedded in different activities. See Figure 1 for the relation between activities and fragments.
Figure 1: The relation between activities and fragments.
Android Sandboxing, Permissions, Inter-app communication and Attacks by Malicious Apps
In Android, apps are isolated from each other and subject to their declared set of permissions by the use of Sandboxing. An app cannot normally access sensitive data of another. That being said, it is possible for one app to invoke application components (such as activities) of another app for feature reuse. For example, Chrome invokes the Google play app when opening Google Play URLs. The invocation is done using Intents which are IPC objects that the source application passes to the corresponding API. Intents do not just specify the target, they also contain data in two places. The first location is the data attribute (of URI type) and the second one is a dictionary (Bundle) that can contain an arbitrary amount of information (also known as Intent extras). Activities can be invoked by an external app if they are exported in the application's manifest file (ApplicationManifest.xml). Making an activity public (exported) creates a potential hole in the Android Sandbox. Since activities access the input Intent's data, a bad app can invoke the exported activity and provide it with malicious data, that may trigger vulnerabilities if the data are not properly santizied or validated in the target application. As of Fragments, they can receive input by accessing the embedding activity thus its input Intent or as Fragment-specific arguments. See Figure 2 for an attack outline.
Figure 2: Attacking exported activities.
The PreferenceActivity
The PreferenceActivity is a base class (provided by the Android Framework) for showing a hierarchy of preferences to the user. The preferences are associated with a PreferenceFragment. The PreferenceActivity consumes a few Intent extras. One of them is :android:show_fragment which tells the PreferenceActivity which fragment to display first. The dynamic Fragment loading is done by a chain of calls which start at the activity creation and end at Fragment.instantiate (see Figures 3,4). The latter loads the Fragment using the Java Reflection API.
@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); String initialFragment = getIntent().getStringExtra(EXTRA_SHOW_FRAGMENT); Bundle initialArguments = getIntent().getBundleExtra(EXTRA_SHOW_FRAGMENT_ARGUMENTS); if (savedInstanceState != null) { } else { if (initialFragment != null && mSinglePane) { // If we are just showing a fragment, we want to run in // new fragment mode, but don't need to compute and show // the headers. switchToHeader(initialFragment, initialArguments); } else { if (mHeaders.size() > 0) { if (!mSinglePane) { if (initialFragment == null) { } else { switchToHeader(initialFragment, initialArguments); } } } } } } public void switchToHeader(String fragmentName, Bundle args) { setSelectedHeader(null); switchToHeaderInner(fragmentName, args, 0); } private void switchToHeaderInner(String fragmentName, Bundle args, int direction) { getFragmentManager().popBackStack(BACK_STACK_PREFS, FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE); Fragment f = Fragment.instantiate(this, fragmentName, args); FragmentTransaction transaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction(); transaction.setTransition(FragmentTransaction.TRANSIT_FRAGMENT_FADE); transaction.replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs, f); transaction.commitAllowingStateLoss(); }
Figure 3: Chain of calls in PreferenceActivity ending at Fragment.instantiate (as implemented in Android 4.3)
public static Fragment instantiate(Context context, String fname, Bundle args) { try { Class<?> clazz = sClassMap.get(fname); if (clazz == null) { // Class not found in the cache, see if it's real, and try to add it clazz = context.getClassLoader().loadClass(fname); sClassMap.put(fname, clazz); } Fragment f = (Fragment)clazz.newInstance(); if (args != null) { args.setClassLoader(f.getClass().getClassLoader()); f.mArguments = args; } return f; } ... }
Figure 4: Android 4.3 implementation of Fragment.instantiate.
The Vulnerability
A malicious application can invoke any exported PreferenceActivity class and supply it with an :android:show_fragment Intent extra in order to make it load an arbitrary class. The goal of the attacker is to execute some code that will break the Android Sandbox, i.e. access sensitive information pertaining to the vulnerable app, or abuse its permissions. Since the attacker cannot supply his own classes as he is limited to ones found under the class loader of the vulnerable app (Android Framework classes and the App classes), the attack is not trivial. In our whitepaper we depict a couple of exploit techniques, one of them is pretty cool. The malicious app can make the PreferenceActivity load an arbitrary Fragment of the vulnerable app, which is normally loaded inside a non-exported Activity to pratically take it from its natural habitat to a hazardous area where input should not be trusted as the malicious app can now control it. See Figure 5 for the attack outline.
Figure 5: Attacking a Fragment
Attacking the Android Settings
As we mentioned above, all apps which make use of PreferenceActivity are vulnerable. We targeted the Settings app since it is a highly privileged application. By exploiting the the vulnerability we managed to successfully subvert its integrity. The app's main activity (which is exported), com.android.settings.Settings, extends PreferenceActivity thus it is vulnerable. We searched for interesting fragments in the app's package, one of them is ChooseLockPassword$ChooseLockPasswordFragment. This Fragment is responsible of handling the credentials changing of the device's lock screen and is subject to the Device Management Policy. The Fragment's natural habitat is the ChooseLockPassword Activity which is non-exported. Normally the Fragment first asks the user to insert his old credentials (see Figure 6), unless the embedding activity is supplied with an Intent extra, ‘confirm_credentials' set to false.
Figure 6: Normal behavior of ChooseLockPasswordFragment
Since the activity is not exported, this parameter cannot be easily manipulated by a malicious app, however by exploiting the Fragments Injection vulnerability, we can embed the ChooseLockPassword$ChooseLockPasswordFragment inside an exported activity, com.android.settings.Settings, and supply it with malicious data, confirm_credentials set to false. See Figure 7 for the attack outline, and Figure 8 for the result. Since this exploit requires user-intervention it cannot be used remotely thus it requires a physical attacker that wants to change the credentials. Please note that by exploiting this vulnerability the attacker can also override Device Management Policy such as the minimum password requirements.
Figure 7: Attacking Android's Settings
Figure 8: User does not need to supply his old credentials
The Fix
Google has provided a patch in Android 4.4 KitKat by adding a new protected API, PreferenceActivity.isValidFragment, which is called before the Fragment is dynamically instantiated by PreferenceActivity (see Figure 9). The isValidFragment method must be overridden otherwise the default implementation throws an exception, as documented in the SDK Reference.

I will put my captain Obvious cape now and write in short how to get rid of methods with many parameters, especially if some of the parameters are optional, or depend on each other somehow (e.g. go in pairs, one excludes another, etc.).
Let's take a simple RestClient class. You need to be able to pass the target resource, optional HTTP headers, HTTP method, request body, timeouts, etc. All of these, except the URL, are optional. How do you write this class?
The first thing that comes to mind is overloading:
public <T> T request(String url); public <T> T request(String url, HttpMethod method, Object body); public <T> T request(String url, HttpMethod method, Object body, Map<String, String> headers); public <T> T request(String url, HttpMethod method, Object body, Map<String, String> headers, long timeout);
Good? No. Because you may want to call a URL with GET, specifying a timeout, but not specifying body or headers. And whenever a new parameter is to be added (e.g. for authentication), then you should copy all the methods and append the parameter. To put it simply: you cannot and should not have an overloaded method for each possible combination of the parameters.
How should we approach the problem? There are several ways, and the one I prefer is using something like the Builder pattern. The Builder pattern is supposed to be used for constructing objects and to replace constructors taking multiple arguments. But its philosophy can be transferred to the above problem. For example:
public <T> T request(RestCall call);
What is RestCall? It's a mutable object that you configure, preferably with a fluent interface, in order to make your rest call. All fields have getters so that the RestClient can obtain all the fields in needs. A usage might look like this:
client.request(RestCall.to(url).withMethod(HttpMethod.POST) .withBody(requestObject).withTimeout(5000));
It reads like prose, it lets you have only one (or very few) methods, rather than overload for each possible combination, and at the same time allows you to have each possible combination of parameters. The “to(..)” method is a simple factory-method. An example implementation of a withX method looks like this:
public RestCall withBody(Object body) { this.body = body; //assign a private field return this; }
You can also have reasonable defaults for each field. In this case, a GET method, a predefined default timeout.
This approach also gives you the option to specify constraints. For example, you shouldn't allow setting a body for GET requests. So:
public RestCall withBody(Object body) { if (method == HttpMethod.GET) { throw new IllegalStateException("Body not supported for GET"); } this.body = body; //assign a private field return this; }
And if two parameters go together, for example you want to add headers one by one, then you can have an addHeader(String, String) method.
Generally, the approach is more readable and is easier to extend and maintain.
With the Philadelphia Eagles and Seattle Seahawks scheduled to face off on Sunday, I reached out to the writers over at Field Gulls for some inside perspective. Danny Kelly kindly took the time to answer my questions.
1) The most points the Seahawks have scored on the road this year is 27. The fewest points the Eagles have scored at home this year is 27. Something's gotta give. To what extent is Seattle more beatable when they don't have the benefit of the 12th man?
My first impression of the thing that "has to give" for Seattle to come away with a W this week is for them to somehow stifle the Eagles' offensive attack. Holding them to under 27 points seems like the only way they manage a big win in a tough environment on the road.
The Seahawks have one of the better homefield advantages in the NFL in CenturyLink Field, but for Seattle (and just about every team in the NFL), winning on the road is a bit more difficult. I think that playing on the road makes the Seahawks' ability to produce a consistent pass rush much more difficult — the 12th Man has earned a reputation for making it near-impossible for offenses to hear much of anything, so silent snap counts are the norm. This helps the Seahawks' edge rushers get great jumps on the snap, and in turn makes it easier for them to harass and sack opposing quarterbacks. This, of course, gives the Seahawks' secondary a better shot at jumping routes and plastering to opposing receivers. Give most any NFL quarterback too much time, and they'll pick you apart.
So, with that in mind, I think it will be crucial for Seattle to "affect" Mark Sanchez in this game. That's the term that both head coach Pete Carroll and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn consistently use, and that goes to pressuring, moving, hitting, and sacking the opposing signal caller. Seattle may have to utilize a little creativity in their rush without the benefit of a deafening crowd behind them, but getting to the quarterback quick enough to make him panic or rush his throws is not an easy thing to do against Chip Kelly's offense. The Eagles snap the ball quickly, have well-designed routes that help get receivers open, and each play tends to have multiple options that make it very hard to scheme for. Seattle's defense has been playing extremely well the last couple of weeks, but they have their work cut out for them this Sunday.
The other thing that comes to mind playing on the road in a huge game like this is to make sure to play sound on special teams. Considering the absurd amount of success the Eagles have had in that area, one or two big returns or plays on Special Teams could be back-breaking for the Seahawks.
2) What's the best plan of attack against this tough Seattle defense? Where are the weaknesses?
The Eagles have some really great space players in Shady McCoy and Darren Sproles, so I would imagine Chip Kelly will continue to make them central parts of the game plan - particularly in the passing game. The Hawks defend the deep pass with the best of them in the NFL, so at times, the underneath catch-and-run types of plays make Seattle vulnerable. The Seahawks will have to pursue with intensity and tackle well or it could be a long day. The Seahawks are a fairly vanilla defense that relies on execution — getting to spots, pursuing, tackling, playing physical, and keeping everything in front. But in the past, if you can get this defense to start missing tackles, things can snowball and you can have some success. That's obviously scary as a Seahawk fan, though, because of the players that the Eagles have carrying and catching the ball.
Obviously, I would expect the Eagles to try to run the ball as well. Seattle typically has defended read option type teams fairly well — they've got good team speed and normally play very disciplined in their run fits — but that won't stop Kelly from trying, I wouldn't think. Jamaal Charles and the Chiefs tore Seattle up on the ground a few weeks ago, but the return of Bobby Wagner to the middle linebacker spot has really helped clean things up on that front since that game.
3 - How good has Russell Wilson been this season? What's the key to beating him?
Wilson has had his ups and downs this season. His numbers have been fairly steady as compared to last season, but the explosion of huge pass plays and total take-over of the offense that some expected has not happened. Instead, Seattle's offense is still centered on the run game and Marshawn Lynch, with Wilson acting as the facilitator or point guard. What you get with Wilson is great ball security, great escapability, great rushing ability, and the threat to occasionally attack downfield effectively with deep strikes. Seattle hasn't hit as many deep bombs this season, which is a little surprising, but probably due to a combination of how teams defend them and the fact that Wilson's lost a few of his key receiving weapons in Golden Tate, Sidney Rice, and Percy Harvin. Nonetheless, we're all still waiting for Seattle to start hucking up deep bombs a little more often.
Overall, I think that Wilson's had a good, not great season. He's played better over the past few games so he's trending in the right direction at the right time. The key for the Eagles would probably be to try to keep him in the pocket and make him make throws from there. He's most dangerous when he has the ability to move around and throw on bootlegs and sprint outs, but can obviously kill you when the pocket breaks and he scrambles. It's got to be super demoralizing when you have the Seahawks' receiving options all covered up, the pocket broken down, and Wilson seemingly bottled up — only to see him escape and scramble for a ten or fifteen yards first down. This is something that he does with remarkable regularity.
4 - What match-up favors the Seahawks the most?
On offense, honestly, I'm not sure if there is a pure one-on-one matchup that favors Seattle. The Seahawks are a run team though — so it's pure buy-in from all 11 guys to get things going, and they will hand it to Marshawn Lynch and hope he can do what he's done so well this year. The thing that makes Seattle so dangerous on the rushing front is that Wilson is a true threat with his legs — he stresses defenses horizontally with the read-option keeper, and helps soften things up in the middle for Lynch. The key thing is that Seattle isn't afraid to let him actually keep it on read option plays and run the ball.
On defense, I think that Seattle's linebacker play will be key — they'll need to show that they can flatten out and defend Philly's stretch runs and stay disciplined with all their fits. If they over-pursue or allow McCoy/Sproles to bounce things upfield or back across the grain, that's where Philly could really hurt the Hawks. Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright are the two main guys to watch on Sunday — if they can get involved in the run defense and force the Eagles to go to their pass game, the Seahawks can then lean on the "Legion of Boom" to hopefully create some turnovers. Kam Chancellor is another name to monitor — he's a hybrid linebacker-safety in Seattle's scheme, and he's been playing very well the last few weeks after finally getting fully healthy.
5 - Let's hear a score prediction. Who wins this game and why?
Needless to say, this is a really exciting matchup — two really good teams, with strong coaching, talented players, and a lot at stake. I will go with Seahawks 26, Eagles 24, but only because I believe Seattle's defense is playing the best ball it's played all year right now. If they can hold Philly to around 24 or 25 points, Seattle has a real shot. That's obviously a huge challenge though.

"In December, we were extremely busy, and it was all by word of mouth," Tait said.
So far, about 8,000 customers have paid for rides with drivers who work on commission for the service. She said about 2,800 of those customers signed up during the Christmas season.
Sarah Tait, an entrepreneurial-minded woman with a decade in the hospitality industry, and her fiancé, Matthew Kreuger, soft-launched the concept last May under the online handle Assurancedd.com, which stands for Assurance Designated Driving Service.
A Winnipeg couple believe Operation Red Nose is such a good idea, they've started a business to offer a similar service 365 nights a year.

A Winnipeg couple believe Operation Red Nose is such a good idea, they've started a business to offer a similar service 365 nights a year.
Sarah Tait, an entrepreneurial-minded woman with a decade in the hospitality industry, and her fiancé, Matthew Kreuger, soft-launched the concept last May under the online handle Assurancedd.com, which stands for Assurance Designated Driving Service.
JASON HALSTEAD / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Sarah Tait and Matthew Kreuger are co-owners of Assurance Designated Drivers. Photographed on Jan. 8, 2016 with their car.
So far, about 8,000 customers have paid for rides with drivers who work on commission for the service. She said about 2,800 of those customers signed up during the Christmas season.
"In December, we were extremely busy, and it was all by word of mouth," Tait said.
Available by phone, email or on social-media platforms Facebook and Twitter, the service shouldn't be confused with Uber, the controversial ride-sharing service that's riled cab companies. Winnipeg has yet to see its first Uber drivers.
"We'd really prefer not to be associated with Uber at all," Tait said Friday.
"The name carries negative connotations with taxi services, and we want to be clear that we aren't direct competitors with taxi services or Uber," Tait said.
Assurancedd.com is more like Operation Red Nose, except there's a fee, and it's available year-round from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. seven days a week, Tait said.
The fee is $24 for the first kilometre and $1.90 per kilometre after that, with commissioned drivers Tait and Kreuger hire. The service carries commercial liability insurance.
Most trips average 10 to 15 kilometres.
"If we only drove a client only one kilometre, I think we would feel absurd charging them $24. Very rarely are we booked for rides under about seven kilometres," Tait said.
It works likes this: a customer contacts the service to order a ride. Assurancedd.com sends a car with two drivers. One driver takes the client's vehicle, and the other driver follows behind to the destination to pick up the first driver once the client is safely to their destination.
Assurancedd.com takes payment by cash or credit card: each driver packs a card reader to plug into their smartphone to complete the transaction.
"A large portion of our clients work in the business sector, so the credit card and receipt features are great when they're taking clients out for dinner, drinks, a Jets game, or even golf, as they'll submit our receipts to their employer as a work expense," Tait said.
Winnipeg cab companies didn't seem to know about the service when asked Friday.
"I didn't get anything from my own drivers about it, and I'm just checking into it now," responded Gaurav Dhir, general manager of Unicity, the city's largest cab company.
Cab companies must be licensed by the province to assure driver and passenger safety, but Assurancedd.com isn't registered with the Manitoba Taxicab Board.
Tait said a provincial licence is only necessary for cab companies.
The Manitoba Taxicab Board wasn't available to respond Friday.

Sources in the Jerusalem municipality indicate that current political climate in US makes it perfect time to build in Jerusalem.
The Regional Council of Jerusalem is expected to approve tomorrow (Tuesday) the building of housing units across the so-called "green-line" after a hiatus of several months, in spite of international pressure against doing so, reports Channel 2 news.
The plan includes 57 new housing units in the Ramot neighborhood of Jerusalem, an area in which Israeli building faces opposition by the international community.
Although the plan had been approved a year ago by the Municipal Council, plans were frozen up until a week ago. Now the plans are being propelled forward with the advent of approval from the Regional Council, which has been resistant to approval of similar projects in past years.
According to sources from the Jerusalem municipality that spoke with Channel 2, the timing of the approval for the project is not coincidental.
"We're taking advantage of the upcoming government change in the US to push projects forward that had been stalled, said the Head of the Municipal Council for Planning and Building, Vice-Mayor Meir Turgeman.
Another source added that "The Prime Minister's silence on this matter is a green light as far as we're concerned."
She was last seen 48 hours ago (Picture: Metropolitan Police/PA Wire)
Police hunting for an elderly South Korean tourist, who vanished after becoming separated from her family on the London Underground, have said she has been found.
Hoyeon Jang, who does not speak English, was last seen 48 hours ago getting on a Northern Line train to High Barnet at Embankment station.
Pair 'murdered missing woman and claimed her benefits'
Her family said the doors closed before her husband and son could board.
Despite signalling for her to get off when it next stopped at Charing Cross, they were unable to find Ms Jang when they arrived.
They also searched Archway but after several hours reported her missing at 8.05pm, the Metropolitan Police said.
Jang was getting on a Northern Line train to High Barnet at Embankment station.
The Met appealed for sightings of the woman, saying they were ‘increasingly concerned' for her welfare.

Today she was located in Stratford at around 5.15pm.
Officers said she is ‘safe and well'.
Forbes Magazine is running an article on, so far as I know, the only landscape architect to have joined the billionaire club. Describing him as The Godfather of Digital Maps, Forbes reports that ‘Dangermond was raised in Redlands, Calif., a town of roughly 25,000 at the time, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. His father was a gardener who had emigrated from Holland, and his mother was a maid. They started a plant nursery, partly to earn enough to send their five kids to college. Dangermond met his future wife, Laura, in high school, and the two went together to Cal Poly, where Dangermond studied environmental science and landscape architecture. After they married, Dangermond went to the University of Minnesota to study urban design and in 1968 to Harvard, in part for the opportunity to work in a lab that combined computer graphics and spatial analysis and whose members had developed some of the first mapping software. “I had some notion of applying computer mapping to my profession,” he says, “but frankly I was just very excited by the technology and curious how it could be made useful.”' After studying with Ian McHarg and Carl Steinitz, Jack Dangermond founded ESRI and developed ArcGIS. More recently, he has worked with Steinitz on the design method and technology they call GeoDesign. I guess it will succeed but regret that it has not ‘made friends' with landscape urbanism.
GIS is the only significant software category developed by landscape archictects and is the software tool most likely to help with the twin tasks of giving the public the service it needs and fending of professional competition from architects, planners and urban designers.
Note: This story originally reported that Mozilla is dropping its plan for sponsored content altogether. That's not the case. The headline and the story have been corrected to clarify.
Mozilla is updating a plan to put ads on the windows that show when Firefox users launch a new browser tab, reassuring users that they won't lose control or be overwhelmed with ads.
Mozilla announced the Firefox new-tab page advertisements idea in February, saying it wanted to feature "directory tiles" that would be useful to users. The plan has caused some worries, though.
"A lot of our community found the language hard to decipher, and worried that we were going to turn Firefox into a mess of logos sold to the highest bidder; without user control, without user benefit," said Johnathan Nightingale, Mozilla's vice president of Firefox, in a blog post. "That's not going to happen. That's not who we are at Mozilla."
But the new-tab page still could carry sponsored content from "hand-picked partners," and Mozilla plans to experiment with that in the future.
Mozilla hadn't actually shown any ads thus far, said Darren Herman, vice president of content services, in a statement. "None of the tiles are sponsored at this time because the goal of initial experiments is to measure user interest and value of recommended content. Sponsorship would be the next stage once we are confident that we can deliver user value."
The new-tab page has been a source of revenue for browser rival Opera Software. Partners have paid it for years for access to the "speed dial" page that grants quick access to Web pages. Getting people to discover new services and apps is always tough, as seen by the existence of the search-engine optimization industry and the jockeying to get good placement in app stores, and money can help bring things to consumers' attention.
For Mozilla, sponsored content on the new-tab page could also help diversify revenue from its primary source, Google, which pays Mozilla a portion of search-ad revenue that Firefox sends to the search engine.
Tests are in the works, Nightingale said.
"In the coming weeks, we'll be landing tests on our prerelease channels to see whether we can make things like the new-tab page more useful, particularly for fresh installations of Firefox, where we don't yet have any recommendations to make from your history," Nightingale said. "We'll test a mix of our own sites and other useful sites on the Web. We'll mess with the layout. These tests are purely to understand what our users find helpful and what our users ignore or disable -- these tests are not about revenue and none will be collected."
The ad model has been an interesting development for Mozilla, which has been sharply at odds with online advertisers about the Do Not Track technology. DNT is designed to let people tell Web publishers and advertisers they don't want their behavior on Web sites tracked, despite advertisers' claims that such tracking leads to ads that better match the interests of the audience who sees them.
Mozilla, though, has privacy and user control at the center of its mission. The DNT effort, however, has stalled over thus-far irreconcilable differences between privacy advocates and the advertising industry.
Correction, 1:06 p.m. PT: This story originally reported that Mozilla is dropping its plan for sponsored content altogether. That's not the case. The headline and the story have been corrected to clarify.

Good Day Dallas anchor Tim Ryan hates Kim Kardashian. When her name came up in the show's vaguely rude celebrity birthday segment—in which the anchors guess wildly about celebrities ages on their birthdays, then marvel at how old various vamped-up starlets look—he refers to Kim as "she whose name will not be mentioned."
Tim Ryan: I'm on strike, she is not a celebrity.
Lauren Przybyl: Can we call her a reality TV star?
TR: Call her whatever you want. I don't guess her birthday.
LP: You are not going to guess it at all?
TR: No.
LP: It's Kim Kardashian we're talking about.
TR: I'm not even going to say her name.
LP: Wow.
Though I admire Tim Ryan's resilience, it's an uphill battle he's facing. Fame leeching is just how we do things, now. I'd be willing to bet most Americans can name more Kardashians than Supreme Court Justices. (Psyche! That was a trick assertion. Most Americans can't name a single Supreme Court Justice. Kim Kardashian for Chief Justice.) In other Good Day Dallas news, I just found out their traffic reporter's name is Chip Waggoner. Let's give him a reality show, next. [Good Day Dallas]
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- The Boise State Broncos are no longer just trick-play ponies.
They did score a touchdown on a Statue of Liberty play. This was the VIZIO Fiesta Bowl, so of course they did.
But once the tricks were used up and the offensive fireworks dulled, Boise State had to grind out this VIZIO Fiesta Bowl victory with its defense.
Editor's Picks Boise State hopes VIZIO Fiesta Bowl win is a first step The Boise State Broncos hope Wednesday's VIZIO Fiesta Bowl win is a first step toward future inclusion in the College Football Playoff, Kevin Gemmell writes.
More from ESPN.com The Fiesta Bowl has brought out the best from the Boise State Broncos over the last decade, and Wednesday's game was no different. 1 Related
Donte Deayon returned an interception for a touchdown in third quarter and sack specialist Kamalei Correa had his biggest takedown of the season on the game's final play, lifting No. 20 Boise State to a 38-30 victory over No. 10 Arizona in the VIZIO Fiesta Bowl on Wednesday.
"They hit us, we stiffened up and came up a winner," Boise State linebacker Tanner Vallejo said.
Boise State (12-2, No. 21 AP) lived up to its unpredictable reputation in the first quarter, pulling off the Statue of Liberty play while racing to a 21-0 lead in the opening 10 minutes.
Jay Ajayi scored two of his three touchdowns in the first quarter -- one on the trick play -- and finished with 134 yards rushing. Grant Hedrick was perfect through his first 14 passes and threw for 304 yards and a touchdown. Thomas Sperbeck had 12 catches for 199 yards.
The bulk of those numbers came in the first half, though. Once the second rolled around, the Broncos bogged down, allowing Arizona to cut the lead to eight in the fourth quarter.
The Wildcats had a final chance, using their quick-strike offense to march down the field, but Correa sacked Anu Solomon at Boise State's 10-yard on the game's last play.
The Broncos charged onto the field after Correa's sack, celebrating a successful first season under coach Bryan Harsin with their third VIZIO Fiesta Bowl victory.
Not bad for a team supposedly in transition.
"People think Boise State isn't a powerhouse program," said Broncos receiver Chaz Anderson, who had a 57-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. "It feels good to be back to where we were in the past."
Arizona (10-4, No. 12 AP) was overrun by Oregon in the Pac-12 Championship and seemed to still have a hangover against the Broncos.
Once the Wildcats shook out of their daze, they shut down Boise State's high-powered offense and began chipping away at the lead.
The problem was that they needed to take bigger chunks.
Instead of scoring touchdowns, Arizona mostly dinked It's way back, settling for three field goals after driving deep into Boise State's end.
Turnovers also hurt. Solomon threw for 335 yards and a touchdown, but had two interceptions that led to touchdowns for Boise State, including Deayon's pick six late in the third quarter.
"Everything wasn't going our way," the redshirt freshman said. "I was overthinking things and I just can't do that. I played like a freshman today."

As long as the U.S. remains good to weaker but humane states located in dangerous neighborhoods, it will remain great as well.
The world equates American military power with the maintenance of the postwar global order of free commerce, communications, and travel.
Sometimes American power leads to costly, indecisive interventions like those in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya that were not able to translate superiority on the battlefield into lasting peace.
But amid the frustrations of American foreign policy, it is forgotten that the United States also plays a critical but more silent role in ensuring the survival of small, at-risk nations. The majority of them are democratic and pro-Western. But they all share the misfortune of living in dangerous neighborhoods full of bullies.

These small nations are a far cry from rogue clients of China and Russia — theocratic Iran, autocratic North Korea, and totalitarian Venezuela — that oppress their own people and threaten their regions.
In the Middle East, there are two places that consistently remain pro-American: the nation of Israel and the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. Both show a spirit and tenacity that so far have ensured their survival against aggressive and far larger neighbors. Both have few friends other than the United States. And both are anomalies. Israel is surrounded by Islamic neighbors. The ethnic Kurds live in the heart of the Arab Middle East. Quite admirably, the U.S. continues to be a patron of both.

For some 500 years, the Ottoman Empire terrified the Christian Middle East and Mediterranean world. Almost every country in its swathe was Islamicized. Two tiny unique places were conquered but not transformed: Armenia and Greece. Both suffered terribly at the hands of the Ottomans and their successors, the early-20th-century Turkish state.
Advertisement
Yet both Armenia and Greece remained Christian and kept their languages and cultures. Today, both are still quite vulnerable to renewed neo-Ottoman Turkish pressures.
America has been a friend to both Armenia and Greece, although their histories with the U.S. were often controversial. In turn, they have sent millions of talented and skilled immigrants to the U.S. The world is a far better place because there are 11 million Greeks who keep the legacy of Hellenism alive. Armenia still remains a Western outpost — the first country to formally adopt Christianity as a state religion, and a nation that has preserved its faith under centuries of cruel foreign persecutions.

Without the United States, there would never have emerged a free and independent Taiwan and South Korea. The former would have been absorbed by Communist China in 1949. The latter would have been wiped out in 1950 by Chinese-sponsored North Korea. Today, Taiwan and South Korea are models of international citizenship, democracy, and prosperity. They have given the world singular products and brands, from Foxconn and Quanta Computer to Samsung and Kia.

Given their relatively small areas, Taiwan and South Korea likely would not have survived Chinese bullying or, more recently, North Korean nuclear provocations without strong American support and protection.
Our relationships with all of these vulnerable nations are as much practical as principled. All follow international law. All have sent gifted citizens to the U.S. All are fiercely self-reliant and are reputed to be among the world's best fighters.
To visit any of these countries is to experience islands of sanity and decency in neighborhoods of violence and madness. Will these unique but vulnerable nations survive?
In the Middle East, age-old enemies are on the move. There is the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism, the specter of a nuclear Iran, and a newly aggressive Turkey.
Our relationships with all of these vulnerable nations are as much practical as principled.
Kurdistan is threatened variously by Iraq, Iran, and Turkey.

Iran periodically boasts that it will soon destroy Israel. Iran's clients in Lebanon and Syria brag that they can launch thousands of missiles into the Jewish state.
Greece is bankrupt and overrun by hundreds of thousands of immigrants, most of them young, male, and Muslim. Turkey systematically violates Greek national waters and airspace.
South Korea and Taiwan are both threatened by North Korea's nuclear-tipped missiles. China periodically warns them that they need to make the necessary subservient adjustments in their foreign policy to accommodate a rising China and a supposedly declining America.
America itself is $20 trillion in debt and divided. It has lost global credibility after years of issuing phony red lines and deadlines to various rivals and enemies.
The U.S. military is in sore need of repair and expansion. Much of the country is sick and tired of costly interventions that could not turn battlefield success into stability, much less into lasting strategic advantage.
Yet a country is not just defined by its economic and military strength, its global clout or its powerful allies. It is also judged on how it treats weaker but humane nations. As long as the U.S. remains good to these impressive but vulnerable states, it will remain great as well.

When watching the PBA pros, you may think, "Hey, I bowled a 210 before, I can be a pro too." It's not as easy as it looks. There's something that significantly changes the playing surface. Something you can't see: Oil.
History
In the early days of bowling, oil conditioner was applied to the lane as a barrier to protect the surface from damage over years of use.
As lacquer, polyurethane and synthetic surfaces became more popular, oil became part of the sport.
Today, PBA members must continuously adjust their strategies and methods of attacking the challenging conditions of the PBA Tour.
PBA Lane Maintenance Philosophy
The PBA Lane Maintenance Program (LMP) exists to balance the many complicated variables associated with cleaning and conditioning lanes during multi-day PBA tournaments. For all regular events on the PBA Tour, PBA Regional Tour and PBA50 Tour, one or more of the PBA's patterns will be used at any given tournament. These patterns make up the "Official Playing Conditions of the PBA Tour."

White like cocaine and just as addictive, Chalk is Magnesium Carbonate, a powdery drying agent we use to dry our hands and help us stick to the rock.
More Chalk = More Friction?
On paper, dry hands on clean rock gives the maximum amount of friction. However in the real world, hands sweat, and hands sweat even more when they are squeezing or pulling.
Thus, chalk enhances friction– up to a point. When too much chalk is used at once it creates a barrier between you and the rock and decreases friction.
This is the reason after dipping a big handful of loose chalk climbers will often clap their hands, slap their pants, or “French Blow“, to get that perfect thin layer of chalk.
Chalkbag – On a carabiner or a waist belt?
Vs
Go to any wall or crag and you'll find a few climbers with their chalk bag attached to their harness via carabiner.
Generally these folks are newer to the sport. Climbing veterans know that using the provided waist belt is the way to go. Keeping the chalkbag on the provided belt keeps it high on the waist and easily accessible, whereas hanging it from a carabiner usually positions it too low to dip easily.
The waistbelt also lets you slide the bag around to where you need it whereas a chalkbag on a carabiner is fixed in place.
Digging around for your chalkbag is the last thing you want on your mind at the crux.
Brush
Next time you encounter a dirty, greasy, hold or a hold with layers of chalk on don't just contribute to the problem — brush it!
A little chalk is fine but over time layers of chalk fills in all the small pits and texture of the rock, robbing the hold of friction. Brush that sucker to get it back!
Sometimes a hold will be wet or greasy. In this case brushing the hold with chalk can be the answer – the chalk will absorb the moisture or grease of the hold, and the brush will brush it away.
A specific bouldering brush made of boars hair is ideal and will be super effective at removing chalk, but a household toothbrush will do in a pinch. Use a siblings toothbrush for extra sending power.
Regular Chalk
Regular Chalk can be in either block form or ground up as loose chalk
Block Chalk, aka Gym Chalk, is pure magnesium carbonate, uncut. Before you use it you break it up to the consistency you want – either chunky or as fine as the loose stuff you buy in the bag.
Besides being more economical, one benefit of block chalk compared to loose is that you can break off a small piece to make tick marks– just remember to brush it off afterwards.
Loose, powder chalk is usually just ground up block chalk, but some brands such as Metolius will also add a drying agent which some people like and others detest. Brands available in Taiwan include Metolius Super Chalk, and Black Diamond White Gold.
Different brands may have different textures, some finer(C.A.M.P.), and some coarser.
Benefits
Convenient, relatively cheap
Easy to grab as much as you need, good for when the rock is wet or you are sweating like crazy
Drawbacks
Easy to use too much, offsets the “cheapness”
Gets in the air and spills easily
Chalk Ball
The Chalk Ball, or Chalk Solk, solves the problem of dipping and getting way too much chalk on your hands(and everywhere else)
Basically a chalk filled cloth sock, squeezing, or even lightly touching a chalk ball gives your hand a nice fine layer of chalk, reducing the amount you use, and also reducing the environmental impact.
Chalkballs come in closed or refillable versions. “investing” in a refillable Chalk ball is a good idea –once its out, just buy some powder chalk, fill it up and you're good to go.
Benefits
You end up using way less chalk, saving you in the long run
Perfect amount of chalk each time
Reduces chalk dust in the air
Drawbacks
Sometimes you just need a shitload of chalk
Can't make tick marks
If it falls out you're screwed
Liquid Chalk
Sold in bottles, Liquid Chalk is mostly loose chalk mixed with rubbing alcohol.
More than just a “liquid” form of chalk, the stuff seems to have superior properties. Whereas regular chalk has a surface drying effect, liquid chalk has a deeper cleansing and drying effect from the alcohol. Liquid chalk also sticks to the skin better and one application lasts longer than a dip of powder chalk .
In addition, liquid chalk works its way into the crevices of the skin, whereas powder chalk s stays more on the surface.
Perhaps because of the drying effect, we find that our skin holds up better in humid conditions when we use liquid chalk than if we use loose chalk alone.
The disadvantage of liquid chalk is that it is impossible to apply on the wall, not a big deal for boulderers but for sport climbers this means you will still need your chalkbag. It's also a bit expensive compared to regular chalk, but we find that a bottle of liquid chalk lasts quite a long time — a small amount is all you need to fully cover both hands.
Most commercial liquid chalks have some amount of rosin in them, which can leave a sticky residue on your hands, and the rock. This sticky residue actually fills in the pores of the rock and reduces friction over time. Low-rosin chalks like Beal greatly help prevent this issue but even Beal builds up residue over time.
Benefits
Each application lasts longer than regular chalk, saving you a chalk up or two on the wall – useful for climbing hard routes and competitions.
Each application gives you the perfect amount of chalk(a thin, but effective layer)
No mess
Effective in Humid weather, and for heavy sweaters
Can have a small but useful “skin conditioning” effect for newbies or when the skin is feeling soft.
Drawbacks
You cant apply it on the wall
Can be relatively expensive
For people with dry skin or in dry conditions, liquid chalk can actually overly dry skin out so it's best to use it only when needed.
You can't “Euro blow” it
Liquid chalks with rosin are hard to wash off and can build up a sticky residue on your hands and rock.
Skin Creams and Salves
Chalk is a drying agent and a bit harsh on the skin. After climbing, it's a good idea to wash off your hands and apply a moisturizer or skin cream.
Regular creams will help re-moisturize, but may soften your skin. Recently there have been skin creams such as Climb-On and Tip Juice specially designed for climbers. We prefer Tip Juice because it's less greasy but a lot of climbers love Climb-On.
These creams are designed to heal and also help keep the skin tough enough for the rock. No scientific studies have been done but many climbers use and swear by these creams.

Former Ninjas in Pyjamas member Robin "Fifflaren" Johansson has been hired to cast DreamHack Winter's CS:GO tournament.
Robin "Fifflaren" Johansson retired from gaming earlier in the month in the aftermath of NiP's group stage exit at the ESWC finals, with the Swedish team eventually bringing in Mikail "Maikelele" Bill as a stand-in for the upcoming major.
A leaked screenshot from what appears to be a private website used by DreamHack's crew now shows Fifflaren among the casting crew for the tournament, together with Scott "SirScoots" Smith, who recently hosted the FACEIT Finals, and RoomonFire's Anders Blume.
Fifflaren will cast the upcoming CS:GO major
Meanwhile, DreamHack's Head of eSports, Tomas Lyckedal, confirmed the news, telling Aftonbladet: "Outside play-by-plays, there's a lack of good expert commentators so it will be fun trying something new. We've contemplated this ever since he quit NiP. He's in a very unique position, having played there for almost three years and he can give some insights and depth that the other casters can't."
DreamHack Winter will run from November 27-29, with 16 teams from all over the world battling it out for the first prize of $100,000.
This year's 10th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine is revealing on Monday that Wataru Hatano is joining the cast of the second season of the Hero Academia anime as Hitoshi Shinsō. Hitoshi is a student of class 1-C at U.A., and his Quirk is Brainwashing.
Previously revealed new cast members include:
Azu Sakura as Mei Hatsume, a genius from U.A.'s support department
Saki Ogasawara as Itsuka Kendō, from U.A.'s class 1-B
Kōji Okino as Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu, from U.A.'s class 1-B
Miho Masaka as Ibara Shiozaki, a cool beauty from U.A.'s class 1-B whose "Vines" Quirk allows her to grow and use vines.
Kōhei Amasaki as Neito Monoma, a student from U.A.'s class 1-B whose "Copy" Quirk allows him to use another's Quirk for five minutes after coming in contact with the original user.
Kenji Nagasaki is returning to direct the series at BONES, with Yousuke Kuroda returning to write and oversee the scripts. Yoshihiko Umakoshi is again serving as the character designer and chief animation director, and Yuuki Hayashi is also returning to compose the music. The main cast from the first season is also returning.
The anime will air on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. on the NTV (Nippon TV) and YTV (Yomiuri TV) channels starting on March 25. The new season will cover the U.A. Sports Festival arc of Kohei Horikoshi's original manga.
The anime's first season of 13 episodes premiered on the MBS /TBS channel last April. Funimation streamed the series in Japanese with English subtitles in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland as it aired in Japan. The company also streamed a broadcast dub.
Horikoshi's original manga also inspired an event anime that screened in Tokyo in November and then in four other Japanese cities in December. The anime will ship on DVD in Japan with a limited edition of the 13th volume the manga on April 4. A second OVA will ship on DVD in Japan with a limited edition of the 14th volume on June 2.

Strike Brewing Co. is a new production brewery targeting the amazingly underserved Silicon Valley. As beer continues to experience explosive growth in this country, the South Bay Area has substantial room for growth and the population to support it. This is why three former athletes decided to open Strike Brewing. With the absolutely fantastic weather in California, the Strike founders, in keeping with their own love of the outdoors, cater to those in the area living the active lifestyle. To do so, Strike launched as both a “session” ale innovator and advocate. Our “Session Series” beers, to which we are continually adding varieties, are intentionally lower in alcohol, allowing the consumer to enjoy more in one setting or giving them flavorful refreshment after a workout. For the past two years since our inception, we have had a contract brewer produce our recipes. Now we have raised enough funds to build the brewery. Brewery construction is currently underway with all of our time, money and resources being consumed by it.
Unquestionably, Strike is already fully committed to building a brewhouse. But a proper brewery needs to have a tasting room. This idea is easier said than done. It's very easy for a winery to have a tasting room here in California, but we brewers have to jump through hoops. Just to get a permit requires City hearings and a $5000+ application fee. Yet Strike wants to have a tasting room and we won't let that deter us. Not merely a tasting room, but a place to gather; somewhere craft beer lovers can get a both a tour of the brewery and a chance to taste great new craft offerings. A tasting room which is the kind of place where cycling teams, running groups, roller derby teams, rock climbing groups, etc. can come to gather to share conversation and really neat, local brews.
With all of Strike's capital tied up in building the brewery, we are turning to Kickstarter to help fund our tap room. We plan to have a spacious open seating area with tables, chairs and benches. This concept gives customers a wide open view of the entire brewery so they can watch the creative process behind the beer they are enjoying. The benches will also allow the folks drinking to get to know each other better, whether they came together or not. An eight tap bar will allow us to pour our four year round beers (Blonde, Brown, IPA and Imperial Red) as well as all seasonal and specialty beers Drew comes up with.
In return for your generous donations we have laid out a series of rewards as a thank-you. Naturally one would think that beer would be a wonderful way to repay our generous donors, and we agree. We'd love to offer you a six-pack, a case every month, or free beer for life. However, due to the many restrictions placed on us by the ABC, TTB and other acronym laden organizations, giving away beer is illegal. So due to this fact we must offer other perks such as mugs, t-shirts, naming beers, days with the brewer, and naming fermenters.
American aircraft reportedly airlifted Daesh commanders from a northwestern town in Syria before the Syrian army staged an offensive to liberate the town from the terrorists.
In a report on Tuesday, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited several eyewitnesses as saying that US aircraft had recently picked up Daesh commanders from the town of Mayadin, which was later liberated.
“American military aviation first made a maneuver in the area […] near a Mayadin farm. Then [it] launched an airstrike, we tried to hide and saw several US helicopters. There were foreign Daesh commanders on the ground, who were waiting for them next to their headquarters… The helicopters took them outside of Mayadin,” said Muhammad Awad Hussein, a local shepherd.
He further said that he saw “US aviation… first a sound from it, then a massive strike that was followed by the US helicopters' flight and transportation of Daesh leaders after which the airstrikes ceased.”
The 79-year-old said he had served in the Syrian army and could distinguish American aircraft.
Other locals told the agency they had seen cars taking two foreign Daesh commanders and their families from the town to a command post run by the Takfiri terror outfit. They said the ringleaders then boarded helicopters and headed from there to an unknown location.
Mayadin is located in Dayr al-Zawr Province, the last area where pockets of the terrorists are still present in Syria. The town was liberated on October 14.
The Syrian army and its allies broke Daesh's siege over Dayr al-Zawr Province's capital city of the same name in September and fully liberated it on November 3. The Takfiris had first laid the siege in 2014, when they began their terror campaign against the Arab country.
The US has long been accused of colluding with Daesh to provide safe passage and logistical support to its members in conflict zones.
Last month, Russia said the US was allowing Daesh to operate “under its nose” in Syria, calling on Washington to explain why the terrorists enjoyed freedom of movement in a border area where Americans have a military base.
A month earlier, reports from a group affiliated with the Syrian opposition also alleged that the US military had several times airlifted Daesh Takfiri terrorists amid the Syrian army's advances on Dayr al-Zawr.
Phoebe Heyerdahl is a fictional character in the Hey Arnold! TV Series.
Contents show]
Personality
Phoebe is very sensitive, shy and fragile and usually gets emotional when something bad has happened to her or someone else. This makes Helga often take advantage of Phoebe and treat her like a slave, rarely thanking her. Whenever Helga yells at her or insults her (sometimes for no reason), Phoebe fearfully apologizes, even if she never did anything wrong. She is one of the most intelligent children out of Arnold's friends. An example of Phoebe's insecurity is that she always tries to be the first one with the answer, and isn't exactly thrilled when someone else does better ("Ms. Perfect", "Phoebe Cheats").
Appearance
Phoebe has a huge bun of black hair at the top of her head bound by a small yellow scrunchie, and wears large cat-eye glasses with blue monochromatic lenses, a blue sweater that is too long for her (which covers what she's wearing for a bottom) and matching shoes. Phoebe's of short stature, and has a squeaky voice (though it was less squeaky in the earlier episodes).
In The Jungle Movie, she wears a white shirt with a blue collar, a blue jacket, a light blue skirt and green shoes. Her hair is now noticeably longer, and the bun has become a short ponytail.
Biography
Phoebe was born in Kentucky and, at some point, moved to Hillwood at a young age. She has a sweet, likable personality with a high intellect. She is one of the nicest characters in the franchise, and is said to be Helga's only friend.
Among her most notable moments was when she won the City Academic Bowl ("Phoebe Takes the Fall"), a competition that she shouldn't even have been in, as Helga, in an attempt to win the only trophy her older sister Olga never won, had won her school's spot at the Bowl by forcing Phoebe to miss the final question (ironically, McAfee did not receive credit for the role in that episode). At the opposite end of the spectrum, she was utterly humiliated in front of the entire student body ("Phoebe's Little Problem") when she was caught passing gas into a microphone on stage as she was receiving an award, and subsequently refused to ever go to school again (somewhat ironically, the award was for her perfect attendance). Among her other achievements are winning the Parents Tournament Weekend with her parents ("Parents Day") and the City Go-Kart Grand Prix with Helga and Harold ("Grand Prix").
She's also pretty good at handling a fencing sword ("Phoebe Cheats"), even when it's a flashlight ("Wheezin' Ed"). There is some evidence that she is musically inclined as well; she's carrying what appears to be a string bass in "Helga on the Couch" and is practicing some sort of large horn in "School Dance". (However, music is one of those disciplines where you need creativity, and that seems to be one of few things that Phoebe lacks, if "Phoebe Cheats" is anything to go by.) Just as Gerald hangs around with Arnold, Phoebe hangs around with Helga, who considers Phoebe her best friend (she even says so in "Magic Show", after yelling at her), mainly because Phoebe is probably the only person who likes Helga the way she is ("Helga's Makeover").
Phoebe is Helga's shoulder to cry on, down to the point where seeing Helga cry makes her cry as well. It's also shown that Phoebe has a crush on Gerald.
Crush on Gerald
Main article: Phoebe and Gerald
Friendship with Helga Pataki
Helga often makes Phoebe her own personal assistant and hardly ever thanks her for anything, no matter what she does. Another reason is because Phoebe is deeply afraid of Helga and cannot stand up to her, since she's shy and Helga is mean to her all the time. Still, Phoebe is around whenever Helga needs someone to talk to. She is also one of the few people who know that Helga is in love with Arnold, (the others being Lila, Brainy and Dr. Bliss) and sometimes helps her keep her secret safe ("Helga Blabs It All", "Helga's Parrot"). While it's never shown exactly when Phoebe figured out how Helga really feels about Arnold (though it's sometime around Season 4, before "Helga Sleepwalks"), she's also smart enough that she wouldn't let anybody know that. Phoebe seems to be the only person Helga trusts, mainly because Phoebe is the only member of the gang who actually likes Helga.
Family
There seems to be some question as to how her last name is spelled; her school record says "Hyerdahl", but the credits to "Phoebe Cheats" and the award she gets in "Phoebe's Little Problem" say "Heyerdahl".
Not much is known about Phoebe's family, except that her father Kyo is of Japanese descent. In the Episode "Phoebe Cheats", her father said "Kampai!" (which approximately means "Cheers!" in Japanese) and is good at fencing, and her mother Reba has a strong Southern accent and is most likely from Kentucky. Her parents only had speaking roles twice: "Phoebe Cheats" and "Phoebe's Little Problem".

Trivia
Phoebe, like classmate Nadine, is of mixed heritage.
Phoebe is right-handed.
Few fans of the show wondered if Phoebe wears shorts or not as it implied that her only clothing is her sweater (which is unlikely). However there was an error in "Phoebe Skips" when Phoebe jumps there is nothing underneath her sweater. This rumor is somewhat proven, by her 2017 design.
Ironically, Anndi McAfee is known for voicing Cera from The Land Before Time and Brittany from Lloyd in Space .
and Brittany from . Phoebe is the only member of the gang who genuinely likes Helga.
I'VE seen a lot of top players coming through the ranks, writes ERIC SCHIPPER.
Some up close, others personally. While I was too young to see the golden generation of 1988 grow up, I watched them win it all. But I did see the likes of Clarence Seedorf, Dennis Bergkamp, the de Boers, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart, Arjen Robben, and other big names from abroad like a young Ronaldo (the real one), Jari Litmanen (the glass one), and Luis Suarez (the possessed one). And our new number five (the friendly one).
I remember fondly watching as Georginio Wijnaldum was handed his debut. I remember a pretty sturdy, well-built lad, not too tall, far from small, sporting dreadlocks. What most impressed me, though, was his ability to read the game and his aerial presence.
There was something slightly odd about him. While he appeared rather quiet, well-mannered and eloquent, he celebrated his goals like a lad from the streets. You can't judge a book by its cover, though. So to understand the player, you need to understand the journey he's been on.
Rotterdam is a big city. It boasts the largest port in Europe, as it has for decades. That makes for an incredible melting pot of cultures. The Far East, Africa, Eastern Europe and South America; many migrants come to work in the docks, find their luck or just find happiness. There's a pretty big community of Cape Verdean people. For that reason, the best thing about the African Cup of Nations is when Cape Verde do well. Lots of Rotterdam-born players play for the team and the town will know when they've won.
Schiemond, the area in which Gini grew up, is a district of Rotterdam. It's filled with people of foreign descent, mostly of African and Antillean descent. It isn't the most glamorous of areas. A few years ago a mate of his was gunned down in a gang-related incident. Gini's celebrations were a reflection of the environment he grew up in — the streets.
Schiemond is home to some good football genes, though. His brother, Giliano, plays for Philadelphia Union in the MLS. His half-brother, Rajiv van La Parra, plies his trade in the Championship for David Wagner's Huddersfield Town. And then there's his cousin, former Blue Royston Drenthe. I could write so many stories about Royston. Mostly taking the piss, though, so I won't. Let's just say he made an absolute fool of himself throughout the years. But everything Royston is — or was, as his real footballing days are over — Gini isn't.
Rotterdam has three professional football sides. Excelsior is the smallest one. It's a great club to visit, with a lower league feel to it — where you can have a bevvie and watch terrible lads doing terrible things to a round leather thing. Excelsior's stadium and training ground isn't far off Feyenoord. In fact, it's often referred to as the little brother of Feyenoord.
And then there's Sparta. Sparta is the club from the north and they like to think they're the posh side, the classy side. All three clubs, much like most Dutch sides, have heavily relied on their academies. But of all three sides, Sparta arguably had the best academy for a good decade. It's only in recent times Feyenoord have surpassed them.
There's obviously a rivalry between the three sides and Sparta-Feyenoord is one of the few derbies that can compare to the Merseyside derby. It goes through families, religions, ethnicities. Back in the day, when the district you were from dictated which club you supported, the rivalry was fiercer. These days it's less intense.
Why is all of this important? Because the inner city rivalry is something Wijnaldum is very accustomed to. More than others. He went from the youth set-up of Sparta to Feyenoord. On top of that, Feyenoord and Ajax's intense competitive rivalry helps him understand what winning against Manchester United means to a Scouser. He gets it.
Erwin Koeman, brother of Blues boss Ronald, was the man who handed Gini his professional debut. As the youngest ever Feyenoord player, at just 16 years and 148 days, he got his debut against FC Groningen. His side lost 0-4 and were booed off the field, but Gini's professional career had started.
Koeman was eventually sacked and replaced by Bert van Marwijk who managed to get the best out of the players. They won the cup with Wijnaldum playing a bit part role, mostly used on the right hand side. After the cup win, van Marwijk was appointed as manager of the Dutch national team. Feyenoord appointed Gertjan Verbeek as his replacement.
Wijnaldum remains in contact with Verbeek to this day. Verbeek taught him the passing game. Before Verbeek he was a dribbler, always on the run. Every time he had the ball he would run, take on players and try to make something happen. Verbeek trained with him, taught him to make better decisions. Pass more, run less with the ball, position himself better. The young lad made huge strides.
Feyenoord went, in that period, from bad to worse. They reached a stage where they had to sell their most precious assets. At the same time Wijnaldum and Leroy Fer decided their time at the club was up. Both realised they had to move on to keep their career going. A clear-out followed. Chelsea came for Nathan Aké, Manchester City came for Karim Rekik, FC Twente came for Fer and Wijnaldum left for PSV.
Though there were suitors across the world after Wijnaldum, it was the most important woman in his life, his nan, that made him decide to stay in Holland. He was only 20 at the time and wasn't ready for a move abroad. That was a defining moment for the player.
Having started his career mainly as a right winger for Feyenoord he would gradually move into the number 10 role at PSV. Facing the goal, room to roam, the attacking hub. Verbeek had put him there deliberately as he needed to act quicker, pass it on faster and move more without the ball. From a player who made sprints down the wing he quickly turned into a player that oversaw the entirety of the football; rotating the play quickly from side to side, threading through balls and making runs into the box. But his best attribute was his aerial ability.
He would play in a deeper central midfield role a couple of times during his first season, but no matter where they played him he scored double figures. Before joining Liverpool he'd been in double figures for seven years straight, apart from one injury-plagued season. For a midfielder that's no small feat, especially given he isn't a set-piece taker.
If you're wondering how he performs on the big stage, you'd only have to look at how he fared at the 2014 World Cup. At the start of the tournament in Brazil Gini wasn't a starting player for the Dutch National team, but after a few games he fought his way into the fold. He got better and better as the tournament went on and he was arguably Holland's best player in the third place place play-off, as the Dutch beat the hosts 3-0. The goal scoring threat of Gini there for the world to see.
If ‘Schteve' McClaren hadn't already planned to buy him from his time in the Eredivisie, that game surely made up his mind. Newcastle paid a cool £14.5 million but basically got a bargain for the captain of a title-winning PSV side, who had scored 20 goals from midfield.
Moving to Newcastle he found himself among many familiar faces. In Tim Krul, Siem de Jong, Daryl Janmaat and Vurnon Anita he had a couple of fellow countrymen and in Cheikh Tioté, Alessandro Schoenmaker and the ‘Wally with a Brolly' himself, some former Eredivisie names.
As a proper Dutch midfielder, Wijnaldum is a versatile player. From the youngest of ages you're taught how to play football, how to work with the ball, how to act on the pitch. You're never taught how to behave in a certain role. Players are always moved around the team.
Newcastle had a terrible season, but Wijnaldum had a vital season in his progression as a footballer. Despite some difficult seasons at Feyenoord, he'd never been in a relegation battle, so to find himself in that position would have been a steep learning curve. While it didn't work out for the Magpies, he made it to double figures once more. From there he would get his big move.
When you analyse the journey, you analyse the player and the person. The humble lad from humble beginnings. Who knew he would thrive in a port city?

Mogadishu — Two journalists have been killed within 24 hours of each other as the targeted killings of journalists has escalated in Mogadishu over the past weeks, Garowe Online reports.
The last journalist to be killed in Mogadishu was shot dead in the Dharkenley district on Friday. Ahmed Abdullahi Farah was a journalist who worked for a media agency in Yemen and was shot dead after leaving a house in Mogadishu.
According to local sources, at least two gunmen approached Mr. Farah, gunned him down and escaped from the scene.
Somali government police arrived at the scene of the killing and stated that they are pursuing the shooters.
However many reporters have expressed discontent in the police's lack of arrests in the countless killings of journalists in Somalia.
"The government of Somalia other than maybe one arrest hasn't made any
convictions in the numerous killings of journalists throughout the past 9 months," said Mohamed Dahir a Garowe based freelance journalist.
Abdirahman Mohamed Ali, another journalist, was gruesomely beheaded and his body left in Mogadishu's biggest market, Suuqa Holaha. Police were notified after his remains were found the next morning by business owners.
Mr. Ali was working for a sports media agency and was based in Mogadishu.
Al Shabaab hasn't claimed responsibility for the two killings of the Mogadishu based journalists.
This is the fifth journalist to be killed in Mogadishu in the past week and the rising death toll of journalists has worried many journalists in Mogadishu who expressed serious concern in their security.
"Government officials have protection and can't easily be attacked, but we are journalists who are amongst the community, don't have bulletproof vehicles, we don't have guards or even carry weapons. The government showed us that they cannot protect us then some will take matters into our own hands,' said Ahmed Adan a freelance journalist based in Mogadishu.
There have been 13 killings of journalists in Somalia with most of the killings occurring in Mogadishu where 3 journalists were killed in a suicide attack last week.
Despite the AMISOM and Somali forces initiative in Mogadishu, assassinations have spiked since the new President Hassan Sheikh took office earlier this month.

Below are a series of images demonstrating the process of embalming, from The Champion Text Book on Embalming, published in 1897 and written by Eliab Myers, M.D. and F. A. Sullivan, “Lecturers and Demonstrators in the Champion College of Embalming”. The Champion Company was founded in 1878 in Springfield, Ohio, and is still in the same business today. After a first section detailing each part of the human body, accompanied by illustrative plates, the book goes into a brief history of embalming itself, from the Ancient Egyptians to the work of Frederik Ruysch. We then proceed into the details of the embalming process itself, including how to remove the blood, gasses, and liquids from the corpse and how to deal with the effects of various diseases that may be found within. The grainy photographs of the procedures pepper this section, many reminiscent — with the sombre figures huddled around splayed out corpses — of the painted anatomy scenes of the Early Modern period.

"Esperanto has no culture."
To this one, I say "yes and no". People often comment that one of their main reasons for learning a new language is to learn about a culture, to experience its literature, learn its history, etc. This isn't something I have any desire to argue with, as someone's reason for learning a language is entirely their business.
But is it true that Esperanto has no culture? My answer is, as I mentioned, yes and no. Clearly, Esperanto's history is different compared to many languages one might study. Our body of literature is relatively small, same goes for our music, poetry, films, etc. And all of our history begins in the 1800's, not very long ago. And there is no Esperanto country or capital city or even neighborhood, where one can go anytime for some immersion. Our population is scattered, and small compared to many of the world's more "popular" languages. Considering all of this, I can see how this would be described as Esperanto having no--or at least very little--culture, especially by someone for whom a wealth of art, tradition, history, and the ability for 24/7 immersion is the main attraction to language learning.
Before I go on to describe what I consider to be Esperanto's culture, I want to point out that the above is, well...Kind of the "point" of Esperanto, at least originally. Esperanto was supposed to be neutral. It was supposed to be nationless, historyless, cultureless--the intenton being to make it free of the historical baggage that other languages carry. Nobody's hometown has been bombed by an Esperanto speaking nation, nobody has been imprisoned and tortured by Esperantists, nobody has had their children taken away and placed in an Esperanto school. When you speak Esperanto, you are supposed to be speaking a language that has a "clean record" worldwide, a language you could call a blank slate. Infusing such a language with cultural norms and taboos would begin to undermine its concept. (Now, whether Esperanto has actually ever achieved these "goals" of neutrality or if they are important to most Esperanto speakers today, is a whole different discussion...)
So if my answer is "yes and no" then what do I mean? What is Esperanto's culture? Well, obviously, though small, we DO have a body of literature, we do have a music scene, we do have films, etc. And though short, we DO have a history. And we do, actually, have some physical locations throughout the world that could one day become hubs of Esperanto activity, Herzberg am Harz, the "Esperanto Town", being one example. I could go on at length trying to describe the quality of our literature and whatnot, but that's not really what I am getting at and I'm sure you can find the information already written up somewhere (perhaps you can start here). And we DO have taboos, we DO have social norms and biases, which are also elements of culture, for better or worse.
Here's what Esperanto culture is, in my view: it's the thoughts, actions, and beliefs of the currently living and breathing Esperanto speakers whenever they get together and create an instance of Esperantujo. Maybe that is insignificant to someone who wants to study history and books, but to me it's fascinating. Esperanto is a language who is "just starting out". We are just recently reaching the point of having enough speakers that the rules of the language are beginning to bend under our weight; the reigns have fallen out of our hands and we are along for the ride as the language evolves, and it's evolving due to all of our involvement with it. No single person can say "this is what we should do from now on"--like any culture, we now operate more like a flowing tide of ideas than one single person instigating and guiding all changes. We have a living language developing and growing before our very eyes, and this is the result of our collective contributions, intentional or not. It's a first row seat to the first stages of the blooming of a culture from a very small seed.
Esperanto is both a "brand new" and "artficial" language and yet it can easily express the natural thought patterns that occur in the human brain structure which evolved before recorded history. It's a window into human minds across the world, skipping over our differences and focusing specifically on one of the things that uniquely connects us all as human beings, one of humanity's oldest cultural assets--language itself. Something about that is fascinating and very moving to me. Maybe other people will not be "persuaded" by this, though my intention is not really to persuade people to learn Esperanto if they don't want to, rather I just want to describe what I think also counts as culture and might be worth some interest.
Video footage appearing to show migrants at the reception centre on Lampedusa standing naked in the open air while waiting to be sprayed for scabies has provoked a storm of protest in Italy.
Broadcast by the Rai 2 television channel on Monday night, the pictures appeared to show a practice that was labelled "unworthy of a civilised country" by Laura Boldrini, the speaker of the lower house of parliament. Coming barely two months after hundreds of people died in two separate disasters in the Mediterranean, the footage provoked renewed criticism of Italy's creaking reception system for asylum seekers and refugees.
"Italy should be ashamed," Giusi Nicolini, mayor of Lampedusa, told Rai 2 television. "It [the reception system] has to change. This is not what we were expecting to see just two months after the shipwrecks which prompted weeping, tears, commitments and promises."
In the footage, which appeared to have been shot on a mobile phone, at least two men at the reception centre are shown standing with no clothes on, while others are undressing.
It was unclear whether the men had been obliged to remove their clothes. Italy's interior minister, Angelino Alfano, said a detailed report into the images would be ready within 24 hours and that "whoever erred will pay".
A spokesperson for Amnesty International was quoted by the Ansa news agency as saying: "Migrants arriving in Italy, as in any other country, need an appropriate medical exam in their own interests and in the interests of the country receiving them.
"Nonetheless, migrants' privacy and dignity must be respected and no migrant should be asked – let alone forced – to take their clothes off in public."
Boldrini, a former spokeswoman in Italy for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, said in a statement: "These images cannot leave us indifferent. All the more so because they come after the tragic shipwrecks of October and after the commitments that Italy made in terms of reception [of asylum seekers and migrants]. This kind of degrading treatment discredits the image of our country and demands dignified responses."
I am honored to be one of the presenters at an upcoming symposium at Brandeis University entitled "Looted Art for Sale" that was postponed last winter. This interdisciplinary conference will provide an international perspective on the last twenty years of art recovery. Speakers include former Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, a primary leader in the creation of U. S. restitution policies, Kim Oosterlink, Victoria Reed, and Inge Reist.
"Looted Art for Sale" will be sponsored by the Brandeis Center for German and European Studies, the Rosenberg Institute of Global Finance at Brandeis International Business School, the Mandel Center for the Humanities and the Department of Fine Arts.
My presentation will be entitled “Who Makes the Rules? The High-Stakes Legal Conflicts Over Looted Art.” I can scarcely claim to belong among such excellent company, so if for their perspectives if not for mine, I encourage anyone interested to attend. Registration is available here.
But give him credit for this much: He has seen the horror that is his Knicks organization in 2013-14 and tossed down gobs of money to import the Zen master. And the Buddha willing, if Dolan can leave him alone, this deeply competitive import could give the Knicks their best shot at somehow, someday playing meaningful June basketball.
Or Dolan could kick him to the Seventh Avenue curb in a couple of years, leaving him to count his gold while he waits for a cab to the airport. This is the curse of Knicks fandom. Any sprout of optimism takes root in the mulch of deep pessimism.
Dolan adores going long on Hall of Famers. Lenny Wilkens, Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas — all coached here before tumbling down the backstairs of the Garden. Donnie Walsh landed at La Guardia as one of the most respected hoops hands in the N.B.A.; he lasted a few years before he returned to Indiana, where, in peace and quiet, he quickly helped fashion a championship contender.
Still, who could complain at having Phil Jackson back in the fold?
On a most sentimental level, he's a reminder of a more accessible Knicks team and time. When I could see Jackson loping up Broadway looking like a particularly tall and shaggy member of the Band; when I sat on the crosstown bus chatting with the backup center John Gianelli; and when the sainted Earl the Pearl strolled into the New Yorker Bookshop accompanied by a woman so unutterably foxy as to render me, the clerk, mute.
Whatever.
I understand many sensible sorts view Dolan as a reverse alchemist, with an unfailing ability to convert gold to dross. But there's a lot of silliness in the commentary of the last few days, the writers and talk-radio yammerers who portray Jackson as the Slacker Coach, the beach hermit of Playa del Rey. He won't put in the time. He can't name half the players in the N.B.A.
-Cargo ship configuration
-How often cargo ships spawn
-Fleets
-Preset/Semi-Random Cargo Containers
All of the work we will be doing here will take place in the "data" folder. This can be found in /steamapps/common/SpaceEngineers/content/.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets start with the SpawnGroups.sbc file. SBC files can be opened with any simple text editor, such as notepad or textedit.
Here is a small piece of SpawnGroups.sbc that controls the configuration of the Commercial Freighter:
Code: <SpawnGroup> <Id> <TypeId>SpawnGroupDefinition</TypeId> <SubtypeId>Trade3</SubtypeId> </Id> <Icon>Textures\GUI\Icons\Fake.dds</Icon> <Frequency>1.0</Frequency> <Prefabs> <Prefab SubtypeId="Trade3"> <Position> <X>0.0</X> <Y>0.0</Y> <Z>0.0</Z> </Position> <BeaconText>Commercial Freighter</BeaconText> <Speed>10.0</Speed> </Prefab> </Prefabs> </SpawnGroup>
Hello there, i am currently developing a cargo ship mod. I've been working with the game files relating to cargo ships for a while now, and i thought it would be nice to share what i've learned with anyone trying to mod the cargo ships or just plain curious. In this guide i will cover:-Cargo ship configuration-How often cargo ships spawn-Fleets-Preset/Semi-Random Cargo ContainersAll of the work we will be doing here will take place in the "data" folder. This can be found in /steamapps/common/SpaceEngineers/content/.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lets start with the SpawnGroups.sbc file. SBC files can be opened with any simple text editor, such as notepad or textedit.Here is a small piece of SpawnGroups.sbc that controls the configuration of the Commercial Freighter:
<SpawnGroup>
Tells the game that this is the beginning of a new cargo ship configuration
<Id>
..<TypeId>SpawnGroupDefinition</TypeId>
..<SubtypeId>Trade3</SubtypeId>
</Id>
Tells the game what to refer to the cargo ship/fleet of ships as in code. In stock, its always the same as the prefab file name, but that is not necessary.
<Icon>Textures\GUI\Icons\Fake.dds</Icon>
I have no clue what this does, but i don't think its important. I've looked through the files, Fake.dds is just the icon that shows up when another icon fails to work, or something like that.
<Frequency>1.0</Frequency>
This number controls how often the ship spawns. For reference, large cargo ships (Commercial Freighter, Mining Hauler, Military Transporter) are always 1.0. Medium ships (Business Shipment, Mining Transporter, Military Minelayer) are 2.0, and small ships (Private Sail, Mining Carriage, Military Escort) are 4.0.
<Prefabs>
This begins the prefabs section, which deals with the characteristics of the cargo ship/ships.
<Prefab SubtypeId="Trade3">
This is telling the game what the ship file is called. The ship files can be located in the content/data/prefabs folder. This line also serves as the beginning of a single prefab section, which is critical for fleets.
<Position>
..<X>0.0</X>
..<Y>0.0</Y>
..<Z>0.0</Z>
</Position>
This is telling the game where to spawn the cargo ship relative to the actual point of spawn. This is only important when making fleets, i will talk about this more there.
<BeaconText>Commercial Freighter</BeaconText>
This is the text that is on the beacon of the cargo ship. It overwrites beacon text in the ship file.
</Prefab>
This ends the current prefab.
</Prefabs>
This ends the entire prefab section.
</SpawnGroup>
This ends the cargo ship/ships configuration.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second thing we will be looking at is the GlobalEvents.sbc file. This file controls how often cargo ships as a whole spawn, as well as meteors and other things. We will be focusing only on the part about cargo ships:
Code: <GlobalEvent> <Id> <TypeId>EventDefinition</TypeId> <SubtypeId>SpawnCargoShip</SubtypeId> </Id> <MinActivationTimeMs>780000</MinActivationTimeMs> <MaxActivationTimeMs>1020000</MaxActivationTimeMs> <FirstActivationTimeMs>300000</FirstActivationTimeMs> </GlobalEvent>
<GlobalEvent>
The beginning of a global event config. The beginning of a global event config.
<Id>
..<TypeId>EventDefinition</TypeId>
..<SubtypeId>SpawnCargoShip</SubtypeId>
</Id>
<MinActivationTimeMs>780000</MinActivationTimeMs>
This is the minimum time since the previous spawn that is required to pass before another ship can spawn. It is in milliseconds.
<MaxActivationTimeMs>1020000</MaxActivationTimeMs>
This is the maximum time since the previous spawn that is required to pass before another ship is forced to spawn. It is in milliseconds.
<FirstActivationTimeMs>300000</FirstActivationTimeMs>
How much time has to be in a world before the first cargo ship can spawn. When this time is up, a cargo ship will spawn, instead of beginning the MinActivationTime like most people would think it would do. It is in milliseconds.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The third thing we will be looking at is how to make fleets. This requires us to look at the "prefabs" section in SpawnGroups.sbc.
Code: <Prefabs> <Prefab SubtypeId="Trade3"> <Position> <X>0.0</X> <Y>0.0</Y> <Z>0.0</Z> </Position> <BeaconText>Commercial Freighter</BeaconText> <Speed>10.0</Speed> </Prefab> </Prefabs>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final topic we will be exploring is the cargo containers on ships and how to change their randomly generated items. Basically, in a ships file, the place where the ship is converted into text, and where the inventory of a cargo container is stored. If you want to convert a ship into a cargo ship with semi-randomly generated items in the cargo containers, like stock cargo ships, you need to follow these steps. Well, you don't need to, but this is the simplest method. Not the fastest, simplest.
1. Paste down a copy of your ship in a world.
2. Make sure nothing has "Show on HUD" turned on.
3. Turn on "Show on HUD" for the cargo container you want to edit and make sure its empty (one container at a time with this method).
4. Export your ship to a SBC file
5. Open your ships file in textedit/notepad
6. Use the "Find" command using Ctrl+F (CMD+F on Mac)
7. Search for "<ShowOnHUD>true</ShowOnHUD>"
8. This is where the cargo container preferences are kept.
<MyObjectBuilder_CubeBlock xsi:type="MyObjectBuilder_CargoContainer">
and
</MyObjectBuilder_CubeBlock>
are the beginning and end of the cargo container.
9. Look for </Inventory> in between these 2 lines. You should find 2 of them.
10. On the line below the lower </Inventory>, with the same amount of spaces as the lower </Inventory>, paste in the following: "<ContainerType>CustomContainer1</ContainerType>" Note that you don't always have to use CustomContainer1, but this is the name for the custom container we are about to create.
11. Go to /Content/Data/ and open up ContainerTypes.sbc, this is where all the premade cargo containers are. You can set them to always have certain items or semi-random items, the frequency of the items, and the amount of items. You can also control how many of this particular preset container appear on a ship
12. Go to the end, and right above </ContainerTypes> paste in the following
Code: <ContainerType CountMin="2" CountMax="3"> <Id> <TypeId>ContainerTypeDefinition</TypeId> <SubtypeId>CustomContainer1</SubtypeId> </Id> <Items> <Item AmountMin="5" AmountMax="12"> <Frequency>1.0</Frequency> <Id> <TypeId>Component</TypeId> <SubtypeId>GravityGenerator</SubtypeId> </Id> </Item> </Items> </ContainerType>
<ContainerType CountMin="2" CountMax="3">
This begins the cargo container preset. CountMin and CountMax are how many items the container can hold. For example, if CountMin was 4, the cargo container is guaranteed to spawn with at least 4 of your chosen items, but not more. CountMax is the maximum amount it can spawn with. This tells the game what event is happening. AFAIK this cannot be changed.This is the minimum time since the previous spawn that is required to pass before another ship can spawn. It is in milliseconds.This is the maximum time since the previous spawn that is required to pass before another ship is forced to spawn.

SubtypeId is whats important here. When editing your ship file to spawn with a preset container, this is the name you will use. In this case, we have named it CustomContainer1, as we set the cargo container on the ship to spawn as CustomContainer1.

13. Your custom cargo container is done! Filling other things, such as refineries, assemblers, oxygen generators, should be pretty much the same as the cargo containers if you know what to look for. Things like reactors should be filled in-game and saved with the ship to make it simpler.

Yekaterina Lyzlova, AFP | Russian rescue boats patrol off the coast of the Black Sea city of Sochi looking for debris of a Russian military plane, on December 26, 2016.
Russian authorities have found a flight recorder in the wreckage of a military plane that crashed into the Black Sea on Sunday, killing all 92 on board, Russian agencies cited the Defence Ministry as saying on Tuesday.

The recorder, one of several reported to be on board, contains information which could help investigators identify the cause of the crash.
It will be sent to a Defence Ministry facility in Moscow for analysis, the ministry was cited as saying.
Investigators have so far said that pilot error or a technical fault were likely to have caused the Defence Ministry TU-154 to crash into the sea.
Russia has suspended flights of all TU-154 planes until the cause of the crash has been established, Russian news agency Interfax reported Tuesday.
The Defence Ministry TU-154 was carrying dozens of Red Army Choir singers and dancers Sunday to Syria to entertain Russian troops in the run-up to the New Year, as well as other passengers.
The Defence Ministry said search and rescue teams have so far recovered 12 bodies and 156 body fragments, news agencies reported.
The Interfax news agency, citing a law enforcement source, said a second flight recorder had also been found in the wreckage, but not yet raised to the surface.
The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014, the Defence Ministry said.
Russia mourns beloved musicians, humanitarian figure
On Monday, a nationwide day of mourning for the plane victims, red and white carnations piled up outside the Moscow office of the Alexandrov Ensemble, a military bands that was also a music and dance company and an icon of Russian culture.
The victims of the crash included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, as well as one of Russia's best-known humanitarian figures, Yelizaveta Glinka, known as Dr Liza, executive director of the Fair Aid charity.

One singer who did not get on the plane for personal reasons said he was devastated at the loss of so many talented colleagues.
Soloist Vadim Ananyev had stayed behind to help his wife with the kids because they just had a baby.
"I have lost my friends and colleagues, all killed, all five soloists – I feel in complete disarray," Ananyev told The Associated Press. "It is such a shame. I have known these people for 30 years. I know their wives and children. I feel terrible for the children and for all that I have lost."
Ananyev said he had received condolences from all over Russia and from abroad.
"We were loved all over the world, never mind the political situation," he said.
Mourners also lit candles and brought flowers to Channel One and NTV, whose TV journalists were going to Syria to cover the concert, and to a charity founded by Dr Yelizaveta Glinka, who was on the plane bringing medicines to Syria.
At Sochi's brand-new Adler airport, which was built for the 2014 Winter Olympics, mourners came to light candles at the airport's chapel and lay flowers at an improvised shrine that featured photos of some of the victims. Locals also flocked to the city's port a few miles from the crash site to leave flowers by the waterfront.
Russian TV channels took entertainment shows off their schedules Monday, and outdoor seasonal celebrations were scrapped across Russia.

Turkish markets are getting slammed after the US and Turkey suspended visa services between the two countries, exacerbating already deteriorating relations.
The Turkish lira fell by as much as 6.6% against the US dollar to a fresh record low, but has since reversed some of those losses. It was down by about 2.9% at 3.7196 per dollar at 8:35 a.m. ET.
The country's benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index fell by about 3.3%, and Turkish Airlines dropped by about 8%.
The US embassy in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, said on October 8 that it had suspended all non-immigrant visa services. This means that Turkish citizens can no longer get visas for business, tourism, or education, but people permanently moving to the US can still apply.
Markets Insider Within hours, the Turkish embassy in the US said it would be suspending "all visa services." Reuters reported that later on Monday the Turkish foreign ministry "summoned a US diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa suspension, saying it was causing 'unnecessary tensions.'"
The US embassy's decision to suspend visas followed Turkey's recent arrest of a US embassy employee over suspected links to US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who was blamed by the Turkish government for the failed military coup in July 2016. In its statement, the US embassy said "recent events have forced the United States Government to reassess the commitment of the Government of Turkey to the security of US Mission facilities and personnel."
"This latest incident marks a further deterioration in relations between Washington and Ankara, which are arguably now at their nadir," analysts at BMI Research said in a note to clients.
"Turkish-US relations are likely to remain icy over the coming quarters," they continued. "In a wider context, this latest incident suggest that Turkey will continue its general drift away from traditional Western partners, with diplomatic spats also erupting with several European countries, including Germany, in recent months."
According to Bloomberg's Tugce Ozsoy and Selcan Hacaoglu, the visa ban puts Turkey "in the same boat" as Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, which have had US travel restrictions levied on them.
"Turkey, which has been in the western camp since the 1940s, is lumped together with these countries?" Murat Yurtbilir, who specializes in Turkish affairs at the Australian National University, told Bloomberg. "This is the lowest level in Turkish-U.S. relations."
Should the visa ban stay in place, Turkey's tourism sector likely won't get slammed, since US tourists made up less than 2% of foreign visitors in 2016. The banking and financial sectors, however, could take a hit. As the analysts at BMI Research explained:
"[A] worsening of relations between the US and Turkey may weigh on the willingness of US and other Western banks to continue financing Turkish counterparts, especially in the context of a less supportive global backdrop as developed state interest rates rise. Cross-border bank lending is crucial not only for the Turkish banking sector, which is dependent on external financing, but more broadly for the financing of Turkey's sizeable current account deficit and thus macroeconomic stability."
A weaker lira could also weigh on the Turkish economy, according to the analysts.
"The scale of the [lira's] depreciation is similar to the July 2016 sell-off after the attempted military coup," Murat Toprak and Dominic Bunning of HSBC said in a note to clients Monday.
"[W]e believe the political risk is very different in nature compared to that episode and think this depreciation looks excessive. But we believe the risk of a downward spiral in [lira] cannot be ruled out - this will depend on diplomatic developments."
Worsening relations
Relations between Turkey and the US — both NATO members — have deteriorated in recent months over the US' military support for Kurdish groups in Syria and Turkey's cooperation with Russia and Iran in Syria. Other points of tension have included the US' refusal of Turkey's request to extradite Gulen, who denies involvement in the attempted coup and the indictment of Turkey's former economy minister by a US court last month.
In May, members of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's security detail attacked protestors in Washington, about a mile from the White House.
Tensions have also recently flared up between Turkey and another NATO member, Germany. According to the BBC, "several" German nationals remain in custody in Turkey, and Germany has warned its people against traveling there. Meanwhile, Turkey has asked Germany to deport Turkish citizens who have claimed asylum there.
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, praised the leadership of Erdoğan at the United Nations in New York last month. He added that the Turkish president "has become a friend of mine."
After being diagnosed with diabetes in 2007, Kimball has persevered.

Kimball had only led 15 laps in his IndyCar career
Pagenaud held on for second, followed by Dario Franchitti, Will Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay
LEXINGTON, Ohio — Charlie Kimball finally got the breakthrough victory he's been waiting for since that dark day in 2007 when he had to decide whether he should continue driving.
He won the first IndyCar Series race of his career, a start-to-finish green-flag run Sunday at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.
His first victory in 45 IndyCar starts also validates Chip Ganassi's decision to keep him as the team's third driver alongside Indianapolis 500 winners and series champions Dario Franchitti and Scott Dixon.
Kimball passed Simon Pagenaud with 18 laps remaining, a recovery after sliding into the dirt in a here-I-come attempt that took three more corners to complete on a challenging road course. He did it in a backup car after wrecking his primary in practice Saturday.
FRANCHITTI: Will return to Ganassi in 2014
Pagenaud held on for second. Franchitti was third, followed by Will Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay. Dixon's bid to win a fourth straight race never materialized. He finished seventh.
Kimball was a promising American race car driver in Europe when in 2007 he became ill. He couldn't explain it, and it took doctors time to diagnose it: Type 1 diabetes.
"I remember that day being pretty dark," he said."Today's pretty bright."
In between were many moments of fear, doubt and frustration.
"It was the fear of not understanding," he said.
The son of a Formula One engineer kept his focus and never let limitations restrain him, and that's been his message as he's represented Racing with Insulin, a national campaign.
Kimball, a 28-year-old Indianapolis resident, speaks on the subject as often as he can, so much so that even among IndyCar's fan base he's known as much for diabetes as driving the No. 83 Honda.

Kimball, who needed to get stronger last offseason and did, wasn't asked about the doubters he once had. But he spoke to them.
"Getting a win quiets a lot of voices, for sure, especially voices within myself as a driver," he said.
Kimball was in fifth place when it became apparent he couldn't win with the pace he had. Strategist Brad Goldberg opted for a change: Three pit stops rather than two. Kimball did the rest, winning by 5.5 seconds.
The disappointment was that his family, other than girlfriend Kathleen, wasn't there to celebrate. His sister had a wedding in California; his parents were overseeing the harvesting of avocados they grow.
IndyCar extended the length of the annual race at the technically demanding 2.258-circuit by five laps this year, hoping it wouldn't turn into a parade where the winner is determined by who massages the best fuel mileage out of their cars.
DIXON: Ganassi driver on a roll
Hunter-Reay and Power tried to make it happen anyway. Hunter-Reay nearly matched the track record during qualifying Saturday but eased off the gas a bit after the green flag dropped Sunday, hoping to only need two pit stops to cover the 203-mile race.
Kimball went the other way. Hammering down through each of the 13 turns forced him to use more fuel, but he made up the difference by consistently clocking faster laps than Hunter-Reay and Power.
Dixon came in as the hottest driver in the series thanks to victories in Pocono and a weekend sweep in Toronto last month. His bid to become the first open-wheel driver in a North American series to take four straight checkered flags since 2006 never happened. Dixon failed to make a serious bid for the lead and spent the last few laps battling with a charging Castroneves for sixth.
Castroneves, a three-time Indy 500 champion still searching for his first season title, managed to keep Dixon behind him to slightly pad his lead in the standings. The Brazilian will take a 31-point lead over Dixon heading to Sonoma on Aug. 25. Defending champion Hunter-Reay is 65 points back in third.

Two years ago…
Two years ago today, I started thinking about scrapping 7 months of work on a zombie game. It just wasn't fun and I couldn't make it fun. I kept the core engine code, left everything else to rot in my source repository, and spent a month writing the prototype for Banished. I think that was a good decision, even though I've spent way more time building it than I expected, and the game is much larger than I ever envisioned.
Sometimes I look back and wonder where the time went. Have I spent days doing nothing? Since it's the two year mark for Banished I decided to go looking back to see just where my time has been spent.
Let's see – currently the game has:
4002 external resources (that's meshes, sounds, materials, textures, object configurations, ui's, etc).
3.3M of C++ code in 915 files
1.35M of typed resource data in 1397 files
694 submits to source control
I generally don't work weekends or holidays, so per work day, that's an average of about 8 resources, 9.5K of typed text, and 1.3 commits to the source repository. I know I spent at least a month of time backpacking in the mountains, worked a few months doing nothing but contract work, and spent time getting the website going, so those numbers are probably a little low.
I suppose that can be considered productive. It still seems slow. If you decide to make a game on your own and write all your own tech, multiply your time estimate by 3. Really. Seriously.
Here's a pictorial view of how the game matured…. (dates are approximate, build dates on screenshots aren't always right)
February 2011 Here I've started to get a few of the game engine subsystems running. You can see graphics, pathfinding, collision, and initial UI work.
March 2011 Starting a new project makes things go so quickly. Lighting, shadows, and character animation have been added. I also gave the character a shotgun so he could shoot zombies.
April 2011 Wait, wait wait. In 3 months I made my own game engine with zombies chasing you through a town and you could scavenge food and bullets from homes, board up windows and doors, and find safe places to rest? Why am I not this productive all the time?!?
May 2011 The engine also supports spotlights and other local lights! Why aren't they used in Banished?!?!?
August 2011 Everyone is doing zombies. Mine aren't fun. Let's try rocks and trees and characters that are a single box instead. After the prototype was built I went backpacking for a month and really considered if leaving my job to make games on my own was a good idea…
Decemeber 2011 The prototype was nice so I decided to keep going. I rewrote a lot of code, added nicer terrain and rivers, and added a forester to manage the woodlands. Apparently I am also unable to make prototypes with stub art. Skyrim came out in November. Progess was slow for a while.
January 2012 Added seasons to the game, as well as more buildings. Blacksmiths have to create tools, and you can fish in the river! Also added roads and bridges.
Februrary 2012 Despite being simple, I really like playing this game. At this point I'm really glad I didn't keep going with the zombies.
April 2012 Farms get a facelift. I added multiple crop types each with their own artwork. I added particle systems and deer in the forest as well.
August 2012 I'm adding a lot more buildings and townsfolk mechanics. There are now Town Halls doctors, orchards, trading posts, and sixteen occupations for the townsfolk.
February 2013 The UI Gets a facelift and the townsfolk finally get animated. I added maps, schools, and added gathering food and herbs from the forest as an alternative to farming. Feature Creep!
April 2013 Isn't this game done yet? I'm really enjoying playing Banished. Sometimes I waste a day (or three) playing instead of working on finishing the game.
July 2013 Uhh, who destroyed my town? That was a lot of work. Now I have to start over.
Happy Birthday, Banished!
"China's the larger economic power. It's not a matter of opinion, but a fact, that in every investor state agreement, the stronger power wins," said Green MP Elizabeth May, on the ratification of the China-Canada Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) today.
The ratification was announced today in a news release, saying FIPA will come into force on October 1, 2014, and will be effective for the next 31 years. Although originally signed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2012 during a trip to Russia, FIPA was delayed for two years due to public outcry and division from within the Conservative Party.
May said FIPA could effectively 'lock in' Canada to weakened environmental regulation for the next 31 years.
"[Harper] just sold us out in a very effective way that locks in his regressive environmental policies, and we will not be able to bring them back without the permission of Beijing," she said.
"If we change our laws to undo the damage done by the omnibus budget bill C-36 -- if we are to repair the Fisheries Act, put back in place real environmental assessment -- any state-owned enterprise from China that was counting on our weak environmental laws can sue us. They can bring arbitration charges against us, and the hearings don't have to be made public."
As an example of what would happen in the event Canada was a weaker partner, May pointed to NAFTA's Chapter 11, and said Canada has lost numerous times when the U.S. corporations have sued.
She said despite the federal government's repeated claims that the China-Canada FIPA is quite similar to 24 similar agreements with nations such as the Czech Republic, this deal was unique because of the Chinese government's powerful role in business deals.
"This agreement is unlike any other agreements because any investment from China is actually an extension of the politburo of the People's Republic ...there's no distinction, really, between the government of China and Sinopec or CNOOC or PetroChina," she said.
May said she was "shocked" by the timing of the announcement, given that the Prime Minister has been in a legal position to ratify FIPA since 2012.
"It's been ratified on a Friday before we return to Parliament," she said. "Previous Prime Ministers would have put this to a vote. NAFTA went to a vote. Harper claims he's created a fairer process because all treaties must be tabled before Parliament, and previous Prime Ministers' administrations didn't do that. But the reality is that tabling it without putting it to committee for study and without a vote from Parliament has actually less accountability than any previous government.
May said treaty making is a royal prerogative and can become law through a cabinet order in council sitting in Parliament for no less than 21 days after the treaty is tabled.
"But the timing of when Harper chooses to use royal prerogative -- as 'King Stephen' -- to bring in a treaty that sells us out almost doesn't matter. The tragedy is that it happened."
Before the National Security Agency began complaining about being shut out of encrypted devices, it helped develop software for secure communications that could be adapted by the private sector.
That technology is hitting the public this month in the form of a smartphone application called Scrambl3 from a California startup which claims its "dark Internet tunnel" thwarts snooping on voice calls and messages.
Scrambl3 was launched Monday as a stand-alone app for Android devices by the startup, USMobile, which describes it as a way to create "trusted connections on untrusted networks."
The system creates the smartphone equivalent of a virtual private network to make messages invisible on the Internet, according to USMobile president and co-founder Jon Hanour.
"We want to provide the most private and most secure mobile program on the market," Hanour told AFP.
"We think we have the best combination of anything that's available today." Hanour says Scrambl3 adds an extra layer of encryption compared with other secure messaging apps, using a technology stemming from the NSA "Fishbowl" project -- technical specifications of which were released in 2012 by the agency. "The only other network using this is one at the Department of Defense for classified communications," he said. "If you are not protecting encrypted traffic within a highly encrypted VPN, then you are not secure in today's environment."
No 'backdoor'
While the system was developed in collaboration with the NSA, it has no "backdoor" access for the intelligence agency, according to USMobile.
"We believe the NSA cannot break our encryption," Hanour said. USMobile will not store voice mails or messages on its servers and will not use the public telephone network, allowing users to bypass surveillance and making data inaccessible to law enforcement or other investigations.
Because of its strong encryption, the software requires a special US export license and cannot be sold to countries such as North Korea, Syria or Iran on a list of sponsors of terrorist activity.
Interestingly, the NSA and FBI in recent months have complained that encryption used by Apple and Google, which will not retain access keys, would make it more difficult to track down criminals and terrorists.
But Hanour said society has a greater interest in protecting sensitive data such as trade secrets, from snooping.
"If the government has a master key, then it's going to make everyone less secure," Hanour said.
"In our brave new world where the details of our lives and businesses are becoming increasingly public through social media, sophisticated marketing techniques and government surveillance, we are seeing a trend toward protecting our privacy."
Hanour and his colleagues began working on the project in 2011 with the telephony group Cyvergence Corporation and decided to spin off an independent company for the effort.
The effort began before the 2013 revelations from documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
But he said the Snowden revelations and news of other data breaches underscores the need for better security, for companies, government agencies and individuals who deal with sensitive information.
"We think there are many state and local and federal agencies, and especially police forces, who would use this," he said.
In addition to the mobile app, USMobile will be able to install encryption software on corporate servers to create secure messaging platforms. Pricing has not been determined, but Hanour said he hopes to offer the service for individual users at around $10 a month.
Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer with Resilient Systems and a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center, said it was not surprising to see strong encryption technology coming from the NSA.
"From its beginnings NSA has worked on security systems so good that the NSA can't tap into it," Schneier told AFP.
In recent years, however, he said the NSA "has largely been choosing surveillance over security. The exception is the systems they design."
Crystal meth, the cheap, life-wrecking, libido-inflaming drug beloved of actor Tom Sizemore, Fergie, and many other unfortunate people have now found a way to make itself even more readily available, dangerous, and undignified. Unless, y'know, having third-degree burns covering 90 percent of your body and a bunch of teeth missing is a look that you're into.
Over the last few years, the "shake and bake" method has overtaken the lengthy, complicated production technique that required an out of the way location, sophisticated glassware and patience (something meth tweakers tend to be in short supply of). The newfangled way retains the majority of crystal meth's traditional ingredients (pseudoephedrine, lithium, Coleman fuel, hydrochloric acid, etc), but instead of using glassware and an open flame, they're mixed by shaking them all together in a regular plastic bottle with water.
The shaking process takes 15 minutes to produce meth, it's so easy that you can do it in Walmart without anyone really noticing and the batch is stronger—sounds perfect, right? Well yes, if it wasn't for the one major downside: a massive risk that the whole thing will blow up in your face.
The problem shakers and bakers are having is that the reaction is much less stable when you're rattling it around in a bottle of Faygo than when you're in lab conditions. The lithium can react with the water—or the air, if the bottle cap is released too early—and can explode, consuming the meth cook in a ball of flame. Victims of these explosions are flooding into burns units all over the US, forcing some to close as the mostly insurance-free addicts strip hospitals of their resources.
I wanted to learn a bit more about the shake and bake method (for purely journalistic reasons ;) of course), so I got in touch with Tommy Farmer, a detective at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and director of the state meth and pharmaceuticals task force.
VICE: Hey Tommy. How do these shake bottles explode, what goes wrong?
Tommy: A combination of things really, but basically it's a false sense of security on the part of the meth cook. We tell them it's a matter of when not if, because the speed of the reaction and the combination of the chemicals makes it very explosive. The ingredients consist of ammonia nitrate, sodium hydroxide, pseudoephedrine and ether, and with water, that's a very reactive combination.
So a bit of chemistry knowledge may keep you safe?
Well yes and no, the problem with it is you're using improvised devices and when you do that, these things happen. When you create an endothermic reaction in a plastic bottle, you can't prepare for all the equations and outcomes. Even the experiments we've done in our lab where we're trying to learn about this technique and its risks have been failures, and we've had some dangerous reactions. The difference between us and them is that we were wearing fire protective suits, but meth cooks don't have $1200 for one of those and so end up in one of the local burn units, which are currently one-third full across the US.
Are shake explosions becoming a real problem for these burns units?
Oh absolutely, it's a huge cost and a huge concern. There's also a massive risk to others if shake fires break out in apartment complexes, motels, or cars driving down the interstate. If the fire itself doesn't kill them, then they'll end up in one of the burn units. In my local burns unit, the Vanderbilt center, a third of the patients were meth-related and we quickly found out this was not just an anomaly for Tennessee, but was similar for the whole US. Most of these meth users don't have any form of health insurance and that ends up putting a huge strain on the burns units. The average cost for a meth burn patient can be up to a million dollars.
Jesus. When was the first time you came across the shake method?
Well we were aware that it hit the States on the West Coast around 2003, and didn't hit the South untill about 2007. The use increases exponentially each year. I would say that shake labs now account for 80 percent of our lab seizures. Technically, one shake bottle is a lab and people think that skews the stats, but we never only just find one, in one seizure we found 98 shake bottles. On average, we find three or four per seizure.
Why do you think the shake method exists? Is it purely because of its ease, or is it linked to the recession?
I think it goes back to the complexity of the meth problem. If meth users don't have to be beholden to manufacturers and dealers, they don't have to worry about having a good contact to the finished product. They feel they can run under the radar, they want a purer form and by making it themselves they feel they have an element of quality control.
With the shake method increasing the use and availability of meth, would you say meth has now become the most dangerous drug in America?
If you add in the manufacturing, absolutely. It's the worst drug that I've seen come down the pipeline in my law enforcement career because of the complexity of it. It's so draining chasing the labs themselves, it's the cumulative impact, it impacts so many areas of the community, it can be devastating. If you look at the drug itself and the addictiveness, one could argue that it's as addictive as crack or heroin. With those drugs you're only dealing with the finished product, but meth you have the labs, and that makes it so much harder.
How does law enforcement fight that?
We can't use conventional means of investigating, so we have to train the law enforcement to also be hazardous waste experts, people who can go into a lab and stabilize, segregate, and dismantle the chemicals and equipment. We need to make sure our law enforcement officers received the proper protective equipment which we provide via strategically placed response trucks. We've also set up a statewide intelligence system that tracks the pseudoephedrine as well as giving law enforcement the ability to report the clandestine labs and map their locations.
Have you come across many horror stories in your time fighting meth?
[Laughs] On a monthly basis, yes: The calls from the family moving into a meth home that we were not aware and the children becoming ill with respiratory problems. From stuff like that to directly seeing children who've accidentally picked up a glass full of meth ingredients, drunk it, and then had their oesophagus literally eaten out by the sulphuric acid. It's every month you see stuff like this, it's ridiculous.
Throatless kids, burning houses, burns units shutting down... the shake method has a lot to answer for.

Violence in the name of religion has become an urgent global issue, with growing debate about how to stop it.
The scourge of violence in the name of religion calls for concerted action by governments, religious communities, civil society and the media
A recent congress of world religious leaders in the capital of Kazakhstan is one example of new efforts to find solutions.
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, urged the delegates for their help.
“The scourge of violence in the name of religion calls for concerted action by governments, religious communities, civil society and the media,” he said.
And that is one of the key concerns: that security forces are often alone in the fight against extremism.
Sayed Mohammad Al-Musawi from the World Ahlul Bayt Islamic League told euronews: “We have to deal with it (at) the grassroots, which is the ideology, which has been spread by the misunderstanding of religion.
“It is not only security and the military attacks. No, we have to tackle it through tackling the wrong ideology.”
That means religions publicly disputing extremist messages, and setting an example through their own internal and inter-religious relations.
Monsignor Khaled Akasheh from the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue at the Vatican said: “What we say, what we teach, what we write, what we preach, should be against extremism and violence, and at the same time call strongly to building justice.”
Yitzhak Yosef, the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, told the congress: “Every one should act and not just talk, even more so if we're talking about religious leaders. It's our job to be an example to our people.”
Nurlan Asanov, the Imam of the East Kazakhstan Region, told euronews: “When religious leaders don't have dialogue, they blame each other of impiety, in the absence of faith, or incorrect faith within their own religions. Then there's personal infighting, which leads people to clashes.”
Others say it is also about youth education and reducing poverty and injustice, but also going after extremist recruiters, including those operating online.
Talib Mohammad Al-Shehhi, an Islamic affairs advisor to the United Arab Emirates government, said: “Everyone who has an idea, who has a conviction, can record what they want and broadcast it to the entire world, and this is the great problem in our society.”
Dr. Kala Acharya from the Somaiya Vidyavihar educational institute in Mumbai in India told euronews: “What the political leaders should do is find the camps where military training to fight against other religions is given to the youth, where they are brainwashed, and to put a ban on such camps.”
The Russian Orthodox Church is one of those calling for a special UN body dedicated to the problem, something it proposed years ago.
Rev. Dimitry Safonov, head of inter-religious contacts at the Russian Orthodox Church, said: “Unfortunately our voice was not heard, the position was not supported. Maybe if there had been backing at the time, extremism would not be as widespread as it is today.”
Amid increasing pressure for solutions, the UN chief told the congress he would announce a new global action plan on the issue later in the year.

A typical Concerto network will include a content server and some physical displays. For this deployment overview, we focus on the Concerto Content Server (1) and the computers which power the front end displays (2). A successful deployment will include these two elements.
The server-side code for Concerto is distributed in several ways -- as source code for a Ruby on Rails application, as a Debian package, and as a standalone Virtual Machine with everything already installed and configured. You can read about those methods and their prerequisites over at the installation wiki . Once Concerto has a database, and a webserver that can serve Rails applications, it will install all the Ruby gems necessary as well as necessary tables and sample data on first startup. For the full suite image and document processing capabilities, you'll want to ensure that all the prerequisites mentioned in the wiki are fulfilled (mostly Imagemagick and the docsplit dependencies).
The Content Server must have the Concerto base software installed and configured properly so that it may control all client units on the network and distribute uploaded messages. Here's how you get started with your Content Server:
Once your Content Server is configured, you're going to want to use the Concerto client firmware with one or more client-side computers.
What kind of client computers should I use?
Any computer and operating system capable of displaying the Concerto web application in a browser can be used -- and many users report good outcomes with Raspberry Pi's (though not for HD graphics or video) as well as the ChromeBox. Currently, we recommend a setup similiar to the following for a computer dedicated to displaying Concerto content.
Last Updated 2015-01-16
What are the options for setting up the client machines?
While a Concerto "screen" could just consist of content loaded via web browser on an existing computer, we recommend using the Concerto Player for screen on/off control, reliability, and additional features. It can be downloaded either as a raw image (for an SD or CF card) or as a virtual machine for testing and development.
What displays would you recommend for use with Concerto?
Depending on the location and application of a Concerto installation, anything from an old CRT monitor to a fancy projector may work well. In terms of display build quality, aesthetic appeal, and ability to be controlled via serial port, we prefer and recommend Sharp Professional LCD displays such as the PN-E421.
We have found that Plasma displays make poor choices for digital signage applications, due to the static nature of signage content and the propensity of plasma screens to burn-in.
School is almost out, and it's time to take stock and figure out where you will be continuing your education in the fall. This is a very important decision that will greatly influence your life (and indeed, your lifespan), so there are many factors to consider. We have therefore compiled a list of the top five institutions of higher education for the aspiring practitioner of magic.
1. School for Wizards
Location: Roke Island
Academics: Lessons are taught by the Nine Masters. Subjects include Epic Balladry, Wind and Weather, Changing, Herbalism, Illusion, Patterns, Summoning, Ancient Languages, and Naming.
Student Life: Recreational activities include magic boat races, invisible hide and seek, learning all three hundred verses of the Deed of Erreth-Akbe, and dueling illegally with your bitter rival, thus summoning an evil shadow that will scar you for life and seriously cramp your post-grad opportunities.
Tuition: Your true name.
Study Abroad: You too can travel to the Isolate Tower and learn the true name of every drop of water in the sea. It's just like spending a semester in France, we promise.
Odds of Dying: Low, as long as you don't try to prove how cool you are by summoning an evil shadow.
Prospects after Graduation: Chase an evil shadow to the far ends of the earth!
Most Protagonistic Alumnus: Archmage Ged
2. Unseen University
Location: Ankh-Morpork, turnwise side of the Ankh River, hubwards of the Isle of Gods
Academics: Majors include but are not limited to: Inadvisably Applied Magic, Virtual Anthropology, Extreme Horticulture, Morbid Bibliomancy, and Vindictive Astronomy. This is assuming that you can actually find a professor and convince him to show you any magic. Students are expected to conduct independent study in the Library, where the books are kept chained for your safety.
Student Life: Recreational activities include: engaging in absurd archaic non-magical rituals, having your form altered irrevocably, dying, trying to find your professors, recovering from book related injuries, and dying.
Tuition: Be the eighth son of an eighth son and get a wizard to die and bequeath you his staff. Or be the eighth son of a wizard. Which is kind of the same thing, but worse.
Study Abroad: Your professors will spend most of their time abroad.
Odds of Dying: High. Very high.
Prospects After Graduation If By Some Miracle You Are Still Alive: Become a professor at Unseen University. You might have to kill someone, but it's totally worth it. Until someone kills you back.
Most Protagonistic Alumni: Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully, Eskarina Smith, Rincewind
3. Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy
Location: Somewhere in upstate New York, USA
Academics: Majors are somewhat slippery and culminate in thesis-like final projects that do not seem to matter all that much. Students are broadly sorted into Disciplines, which include Physical Magic, Nature Magic, Illusion, Healing, and Knowledge. Each discipline may or may not have a private clubhouse.
Student Life: Recreational activities include drinking classy forms of booze, using animal transformation to overcome inhibitions, and pondering the ethics of magic just enough to have interesting conversations but not so much that it stops you from doing any.
Tuition: Everyone gets a scholarship? Maybe? It seems déclassé to talk about it.
Study Abroad: Hope you've always wanted to go to Antarctica.
Odds of Dying: Statistically low, but there is a distinct possibility that your hubris will cause one of your classmates to be consumed by a faceless Beast.
Prospects after Graduation: Become the ruler of the magical country from your favorite childhood fantasy novels! Foreswear magic and become an associate management consultant for an accounting firm!
Most Protagonistic Alumni: Quentin Coldwater
4. The University
Location: Adjacent to Imre, the Commonwealth
Academics: Majors include Sympathy, Artificery, Alchemy, History, Arithmetic, Medicine, Linguistics, Rhetoric, and Naming. Each discipline has a Master who oversees the department and teaches many of the classes. The Archives are an excellent resource for research and study, just try not to get banned your first week.
Student Life: Popular recreational activities include holding grudges, being the best at everything, and drinking in taverns.
Tuition: Individually set for each student pending an interview at the start of the term. Varies greatly depending on financial need, aptitude, and whether you've pissed off one of the Masters.
Study Abroad: You're probably going to have to take a semester off to get kidnapped by pirates, work for a shifty prince, and learn how to be an awesome ninja if you want to keep up with being the best at everything.
Odds of Dying: Low, though you may be disfigured by chemical burns or lose touch with reality and spend the rest of your life talking to inanimate objects in the Underthing.
Prospects after Graduation: Become obsessed with folkloric figures and pursue the truth of their existence doggedly until it destroys everything you love! Or, you know, get a job using the practical skills you have amassed.
Most Protagonitastic Alumnus: The Kingkiller
5. The Scholomance
Location: Mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, Transylvania
Academics: Majors include Secrets of Nature, Language of Animals, Magic Spells and Charms, Dragon Riding, and Storm Management. All classes are taught by the Devil.
Student Life: Only ten students are admitted at a time. Housing is provided for all students: hope you like caves. Your family will think you died and will probably revile you if you turn up after graduation, so don't count on having a couch to sleep on while you figure out what to do with your life.
Tuition: Possibly your soul.
Study Abroad: You may get to spend some time in England.
Odds of Dying: Low, but everyone will think you are dead anyway. You may wish you were.
Odds of Undying: High
Prospects after Graduation: One in ten will become the Devil's Storm Management lackey!
Most Protagonitastic Alumnus: Dracula

The United States government is having a little trouble printing up its newly designed $100 bills. More than 1 billion of these new Benjamins are unusable because they crease in the presses, leaving blank spots on the final product. It's an amusing minor story whose true significance has been missed. Why does the world need 1 billion $100 bills? Indeed, why does the U.S. continue to print C-notes at all?
In May 1976, an economist named James Henry published a wonderful essay in the Washington Monthly titled “Calling in the Big Bills.” In it, he observed that “only two kinds of activities in the U.S.” required the use of large-denomination currency. One was tax evasion, and the other was organized crime. Henry might also have added certain legal but morally dubious needs, like a compulsive gambler's need to hide his addiction from his family or a billionaire braggart's need to light his cigar with a flaming C-note (though the latter type is probably a creature of myth). In his 1976 piece, Henry proposed that the Treasury and Federal Reserve call in all bills of $50 or more and require holders to exchange them in banks for $10 and $20 bills.
Thirty-four years of inflation make Henry's inclusion of $50 bills seem perhaps overzealous, but, otherwise, his argument has become more compelling, not less. Technological change has reduced much further the plausible need of any law-abiding American to carry a C-note in his wallet or to stash a pile of C-notes in his mattress. Demand for $100 and $50 bills is “so weak,” observes David Gorman, author of the 2007 book, Cashless Money, “that banks do not stock [them] in their ATMs.” Flash a $100 at the typical American retailer and you're liable to inspire befuddlement on par with that described in Mark Twain's short story “The Million-Pound Banknote.” (You probably won't enjoy the same pleasant fate enjoyed by Twain's hero, who, because no one can break his note, never has to pay for anything again.)
Today, when you ask economists and government officials why the $100 bill still exists, they probably won't mention its domestic use. Instead, they'll talk about its popularity overseas. Thirty-four years of globalization have shifted most demand for C-notes offshore. Roughly two-thirds of all U.S. currency is held today in other countries, mostly in large denominations. In 2001 the Federal Reserve estimated that 90 percent of the $100 bills ordered by the Federal Reserve (which accounts for the overwhelming majority of C-notes ordered nationwide) were paid out to foreign banks “to satisfy foreign demand.” The overseas share of $100 bills has slackened a little in the new century relative to domestic demand—probably because the C-note is becoming more popular with illegal immigrants here—but today 65 percent of all Benjamins are in foreign hands. The $100 bill may be America's most successful export. But guess what? Foreigners have fishy reasons for holding onto C-notes, too!
The basic economic transaction between the United States and the rest of the world (especially China) goes as follows: They give us automobiles and computers and baby strollers and in exchange we give them dollars, the most stable currency in the world. But usually foreigners don't want physical dollars to stash under their mattresses. Paper bills don't generate interest! Instead, foreigners want American money in the form of bank deposits, which do generate interest, and in Treasury notes, which generate more interest, and maybe even in U.S.-based corporations or real estate, which have the potential to create more wealth still. An economist I know recently visited China as a consultant. “I told them to buy up all of Washington, D.C.!” he told me gleefully.
Some foreigners, though, would prefer to hang onto paper dollars, because they don't want anybody to know they have American bucks. In a few instances, that's a justifiable survival strategy. As Michael S. Derby put it in the Dec. 8 Wall Street Journal, “The dollar is often king in nations with troubled or historically dysfunctional domestic economies.” If you live in a corrupt country that's likely to seize your wealth, you might be forgiven for wanting to hide Benjamins from the authorities. Or you might not want to use them to pay taxes. Paying taxes is every citizen's obligation under a morally legitimate regime, but what higher purpose would be served by paying taxes to Nazi Germany or apartheid South Africa?
But the world's oppressed probably don't account for very many of those C-notes, because oppressed people aren't known for their ability to accumulate vast quantities of cash. Most of the foreign Benjamins, it seems safe to assume, are in the possession of kleptocrats, drug lords, warlords, oligarchs, terrorists and assorted other varieties of extremely nasty and powerful people. It doesn't make a lot of sense to expand their supply of covert cash. One of the reasons the C-note was recently redesigned was to make life harder for future counterfeiters. North Korea has manufactured about $5 million worth of fake C-notes. But if you really want to shut down high-denomination counterfeiters (who by definition get the most bang for their buck), the simplest solution would be to stop issuing high-denomination currency at all. Then all crisp new Benjamins would be counterfeit.
So why do we keep printing $100 bills? As with any valuable export, we worry that if the C-note ceased to be available to foreign criminals and dictators, another paper currency would take its place. The leading candidate would be the 500 euro note, which criminals have reportedly nicknamed “the Bin Laden” because its compactness makes it so convenient to hide ill-gotten gains in. Granted, the euro is having a bumpy ride at the moment. But it will come back, and when it does, it will stand ready to take the dollar's place wherever and however it can. Indeed, it's not inconceivable that, should American presses stop spitting out $100 bills, the 500 euro note might one day replace the Benjamin as the preferred currency of America's criminal class.
But that doesn't seem a particularly noble reason to keep printing the damned things. Back in 1969, the U.S. government started worrying about the sketchy doings of people who trafficked in $500 bills. You know what it did? It stopped making them.

Stay-at-home mothers are increasingly facing a damaging but unspoken prejudice that assumes they are stupid, lazy and unattractive, a leading child development expert has warned.
Dr Aric Sigman, a biologist and psychologist, said that what he called “motherism” should be tackled as much as other prejudices such as racism.
He told a conference that the rise of derogatory attitudes towards stay-at-home mothers had helped make it socially unacceptable in some circles to argue that children benefit from “full-time” parenting.
Dr Sigman, a fellow of the Society of Biology and associate fellow of the British Psychological Society, has argued in the past that evidence about the long-term effects of sending very young children to full-time day care is being ignored because of a political and economic agenda.
Addressing a conference organised by the Mothers At Home Matter group, he said that evidence from biosciences showed that mothers provided “unrivalled benefits” to young children that other people, including fathers, cannot.
Dr Sigman told the conference: “You should take on 'motherism' – the prejudice against stay-at-home mothers – a prejudice that expresses itself in derogatory clichés like: 'You gain a baby and lose a brain' and comments that refer to 'schoolgate mother mentality', or to being 'willingly self-lobotomised'.
“The implication is that by being a full-time mother you are 'subjugated and servile' and even sexually unattractive once you are a mother – a quality only associated with women who return to work with their high heels and clipboards.”
He added: “I have heard how full-time mothers are described. The tone seems to be that they are not as interesting, that they have taken a step down both socially and intellectually but also in terms of esteem.
“If you applied any other kind of minority group tag to that there would be an outcry.”
The Mothers At Home Matter group – which has campaigned against taxpayer-funded child care support for parents who both work – recently challenged George Osborne, the Chancellor, over his remark that being a full-time mother was a “lifestyle choice”.
Dr Sigman's comments will prove controversial, with figures showing the majority of mothers now work. There have also been conflicting studies on the varying impact on children of having a working, or stay-at-home mother.
Some research suggests those who attend good quality nurseries or childminders are often better prepared for school and have better communication and social skills.
Many working families see “full time” parenting as a luxury enjoyed only by those wealthy enough to live on one wage or those on benefits.
Dr Sigman, who has four children, said that the derogatory attitudes towards stay-at-home mothers appeared to be the result of a mix of political and economic agendas.
“I suppose the older feminism, liberal-Left feminism, has ended up a strange bedfellow with Right-wing capitalism.”
David Waldrop and I were sitting in the National Press Club's legendary Truman Lounge watching two huge television screens showing CNN's coverage of the second Republican debate.
Sitting on a table in front of us was a laptop computer running Linux and a data analysis tool called LUX2016 and it was getting as much attention as the screens on the walls. Waldrop, who is CEO and founder of ICG Solutions in Chantilly, Va., was pointing out the changes in the constantly moving bar graphs on his laptop.
Those graphs displayed on Waldrop's computer were reporting the readings from Twitter as users everywhere reacted to the debates and to the candidates. The readings tracked the number and nature of the tweets so it could update the results every 10 seconds. On the graphs, we saw segments for each 10-second period along with a color code for statistically important changes.
The color changed according to the variance measured by standard deviations. As a result, if the public on Twitter increased its response to a candidate by 10 standard deviations, the segment was colored red.
Equally important to how much of a response a candidate received was the duration and consistency of the response. For example, we might see a big response for 30 seconds when a candidate said something dramatic, but then a lower number other times.
But not everything worked exactly that way. One candidate, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, began picking up steam as the debate began, but instead of dropping when she wasn't talking, her response continued to grow. By 10 p.m., it was obvious that no matter what happened for the next hour of the debate, Fiorina had won.
Later, as we analyzed the numbers and looked at samples of the actual social media activity, it was clear that we were witnessing a turnaround in politics. The numbers didn't appear to come from a social media team, but rather from real people.
Equally surprising was what happened with some of the other candidates. Notably, Republican front-runner Donald Trump's numbers dropped, slowly at first, then quickly.
By the end of the night, Trump's numbers reflecting his social media support were some 900 points down from Fiorina. Afterward, Waldrop and I discussed what this drop might mean. Had we seen the beginning of Trump's decline?
As it turned out, it wasn't the beginning. What we were seeing was perhaps the first public evidence of a greater decline that had begun three weeks earlier. The next day Ben Schrenckinger, reporter for Politico Magazine, published the results of his own study using different data, but showing the same result that we had seen.
Our results also showed data that might give some of the other candidates reason to rethink their campaigns.
“Everything Now” is the first single from Arcade Fire's upcoming 2017 album, Everything Now. While their previous record, Reflektor, divided fans with its progression towards a darker, dance-oriented sound fueled by trips to Haiti, “Everything Now” signals a shift towards the brighter side of the disco ball. Reflektor was a refreshing change for the band, as they broke their indie rock mold, and they continue to do so with “Everything Now”.
Arcade Fire are still interested in making dance music, but those dark, Haitian drumbeats are replaced with a bright, shimmering rhythm that could've come off an ABBA record. “Everything Now” is driven by a simple bassline, shimmering piano, and dancing flutes. It gives the song a very summery, throwback dance sound, which becomes even more apparent when listening to the instrumental. However, as it always is with Arcade Fire, a closer look at the lyrics reveal a much darker song than it is on the surface. It explores themes they've covered before such as isolation and dissatisfaction coming with the rise of technology and instant gratification. Lines like “Every inch of space in your head / Is filled up with the things that you read” allude to the way media is consumed. Every movie, song, or book you could ever want is at your fingertips and “I guess you've got everything now”. The song conveys that material goods fill the void of more important matters. In the third verse, Win Butler sings about a “happy family with everything now” with an absent father and neglectful mother. Thematically, “Everything Now” could fit nicely in The Suburbs. The bridge of the song features a recording they took of an audience at the festival Voodoo Music + Arts Experience in New Orleans last year. The song features a sing-along chorus with a call and response style delivery between Win and the background singers. “Everything Now” might not be the most grandiose or poignant song in their discography, but it was a smart choice for the lead single. It's bright, shimmering, upbeat, and will surely win them new fans with the '80s throwback sound that's made a huge comeback. Fans of the message Arcade Fire carried will be pleased with Win's passionate delivery on information overload. The title track is also the perfect introduction to the faux company they've created to promote the album, Everything Now Corporation.
“Everything Now” isn't going to appease some of Arcade Fire's long term fans, but it will definitely gain them a wider audience without sacrificing any artistic credibility. It also isn't necessarily indicative of what the rest of the record will sound like, as the latest single, “Creature Comfort”, is drenched in a dirty synth. As a whole, it's a promising look at the new record.
Pressing Details: This is the limited pressing of the single on orange vinyl released by Columbia Records. It's supposedly limited to 2,000 copies, but it doesn't look to be too hard to get a hold of at this time. That number is almost definitely false as there are copies sitting in my local record store, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon. When they dropped the single “Reflektor” in 2013 the 12″ single was scarce, but there are still plenty of copies floating around today. It's hard to say how easy this will be to find in a year but I'd recommend picking it up sooner rather than later. Side A features the album version of the song while Side B features the instrumental cut. It comes in pretty standard packaging for a 12″ single, an outer sleeve cut with a center hole for the label to show through. The record is pressed at 33 rpm instead of 45 rpm for some reason, but it still sounds excellent.
Due to the limited nature of this release I'd definitely recommend getting out to your local record store as soon as possible to grab a copy. I was able to purchase one through Bull Moose here, but they won't last forever. There are also copies available on Amazon here.

The apology is awesome. He blames himself for initiating the relationship—see our hardhitting coverage of "One Night In Davos"—with a subordinate. He says it was not abuse of power, meaning that once he made overtures she was powerless to resist.
The whole affair, literally, is embarrassing the French who were pumped to emerge as global leaders fixing this financial mess. They should be embarrassed over this letter, too.

Colleagues:
As you may already know, the Executive Board is undertaking an enquiry into an incident concerning me and a staff member who has since left the Fund. As a matter of good governance, the Board has retained an outside counsel to conduct this inquiry, with whom I have cooperated and am I continuing to cooperate. The outside counsel is expected to report to the Board by the end of this month and I am urging that the outcome be made known to staff as soon as possible.
This morning I met with the Board and I would like to repeat to you what I told the Executive Directors. First, I apologized and said that I very much regret this incident. Second, while this incident constituted an error of judgment on my part, for which I take full responsibility, I firmly believe that I have not abused my position. Third, I fully support the process that is underway and I will, of course, follow the Board's guidance as to how best to resolve this matter.
I want to apologize to the staff member concerned for my error in initiating this relationship. She is a talented economist and consummate professional. I acknowledge and regret the difficult situation this has created for her. I also apologize to my wife and family.
Many of you will feel that I have let you down, and I understand those feelings. I can only urge that, especially given the ongoing financial crisis, we all retain our focus on the work of the Fund and the critical role we must play in helping our membership at this time. I also appeal to you to wait for the full facts to emerge and not be distracted by speculation and rumors in the coming days. I am committed to doing what is right for the institution and it is my fervent wish that this matter be resolved as quickly as possible. I also intend to meet with you soon.

South Africa's government is moving ahead with plans to allow a domestic trade and limited export of rhino horns, alarming many international conservationists who believe rhinos will be more vulnerable to poachers after a record slaughter in the past decade.
Draft regulations would allow a foreigner with permits to export "for personal purposes" a maximum of two rhino horns. Critics argue that any exported horns would be hard to monitor and likely would end up on the commercial market, defying global agreements to protect threatened rhino populations.
Most of the world's rhinos live in South Africa. An international ban on trade in rhino horns has been in place since 1977, and South Africa imposed a moratorium on the domestic trade in 2009, when rhino poaching was accelerating to meet growing demand for horns in parts of Asia, especially Vietnam.

South Africa's government has lost court battles to preserve the 2009 ban, which was challenged by rhino breeders, and has leaned toward trade, backing a failed proposal by neighbouring Swaziland at a U.N. wildlife conference in Johannesburg last year to legalize the international sale of rhino horn.
A 30-day period during which the public was invited to express opinions about the draft legislation on rhino horn trade ended Friday, the Department of Environmental Affairs said.
"The comments will be evaluated, the draft regulatory provisions will be revised based on the comments received, and the process for approval of the final legislation will be set in motion," the department said in an email to The Associated Press.
A foreigner who takes rhino horns out of the country must do so through O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and cannot carry them in hand luggage, according to the draft provisions. They say authorized freight agents must provide authorities with DNA data and other information related to exported horns. Skeptics believe the system would be open to corruption.
Some consumers in Asia believe rhino horn in powder form can cure illnesses, although there is no evidence that the horn, made of the same substance as human fingernails, has any medicinal value.
Critics say legalization will spur poaching as illegally obtained horns are laundered into the legal market, similar to the exploitation of elephant ivory. Rhino breeders, however, believe poaching would be undercut by a regulated trade, which likely would allow the sale of horn stockpiles and the harvesting of horns from living rhinos.
The poaching is not confined to South Africa. This month, a 5-year-old white rhinoceros was shot three times in the head by poachers who broke into the Thoiry Zoo near Paris and used a chain saw to remove the rhino's horn.

"Banning the trade in horn has made the horn more and more and more valuable. Had we never banned it, the price of horn would never have got to where it is now," said John Hume, a rhino breeder in South Africa. "And that Parisian rhino would have been safe in its zoo because its horn would have been worth a fraction of what it is."
Hume described South Africa's draft legislation on the domestic rhino horn trade as "a step in the right direction."
But Allison Thomson, a South African campaigner against legalization, said putting rhino horns on the market would increase demand and that South Africa is sending "conflicting messages" about how to deal with poaching, jeopardizing its lucrative wildlife tourism.
"The risk we run at the moment is that if we open up trade and poaching escalates we will have no rhinos in the wild. We will only have rhinos on farms, being farmed like cows," Thomson said.
Poachers killed 1,054 rhinos in South Africa last year, a 10 per cent drop from 2015, according to the government. While authorities attributed the decrease to increased security and other anti-poaching measures, some conservationists speculate that there are fewer rhinos to kill. Drought also killed some rhinos in the past year.
By some estimates, South Africa has nearly 20,000 rhinos, or 80 per cent of Africa's population. Asia has several rhino species, including two that are critically endangered.
An unidentified man riding the Blue Line of a Chicago Transit Authority train in Oak Park, a suburb of Chicago, allegedly hit a fellow passenger with a sock full of human feces, the Pioneer Local reports.

“He had a sock full of his poop on me,” said the 21-year-old college student. “It was everywhere; on my face, my hair, my clothes.”
The woman screamed and followed the man, but the attacker escaped. She was riding an east-bound train from Oak Park to Chicago when the foul act occurred. The victim, who did not want to be identified, said she noticed the attacker when he boarded the train car with her but did not perceive him as a threat. She sat down and began texting on her phone. But, at the next stop, the man assaulted her with the sock full of feces.

Oak Park Police Commander Ladon Reynolds said officers responded by searching for the man in and around a gas station at Harrison Street, but did not find him. Reynolds said police retrieved a photo of a “person of interest” matching the description the woman and other witnesses gave. That man was videotaped on the Austin platform. “We have photos of the offender and we're seeking to identify him,” Reynolds said of images obtained from the CTA. “We've reached out to other (police) agencies and have issued a bulletin.” CTA spokesman Catherine Hosinski said the transt agency has “several high definition video cameras” at each station. The woman, who said she has a copy of a photo of her assailant taken by a CTA security camera, described her assailant as a black man no older than mid-20s, average build, with facial hair above the mouth and on the chin. She said he wore a hooded sweatshirt and ball cap that partly obscured his face. She expressed utter disgust and outrage. “It was like the biggest degradation I've ever (experienced). I wish he had just hit me,” she said, because she thinks that would have been less traumatic. “The worst part is nobody had anything to wipe my face with,” she said. She managed to find some newspapers before paramedics arrived. The paramedics gave her towels and water.
The woman says she still rides the CTA but is much more attentive now. “I just want people to pay attention on the train,” she said. “I try to check the people around me.”

The feeling of foam beneath your feet and melodic sounds of hanging Thai bags swinging in unison can postpone real-world problems. In an outside world filled with vitriol and negativity, the gym is one of the few places left for Jon Jones to find peace and solitude.
The former UFC light heavyweight champ's recent fall from grace has been a tumble into obscurity. He went from being hailed as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world to completely being erased from the UFC rankings. Weeks have passed without so much as a whisper from Jones.
Journalists continue to write stories about him, and fans continue to vehemently defend polar opposite opinions of him. But it all falls on deaf ears. Jones has been radio silent ever since his apologetic tweet, following his felony arrest for a hit-and-run in Albuquerque a few weeks ago.
Carlos Condit, a former UFC interim champion, is hard at work preparing for his return on May 30 against Thiago Alves.
While training at Greg Jackson's MMA, he looks up from time to time to see the most polarizing superstar in the UFC still putting in work, sharpening his sword as some might say, despite his personal life being set ablaze by worldly mistakes.
During an appearance on The MMA Hour, Condit told Ariel Helwani:
Jon's been around the gym a little bit, which is good. I like to see him down there. It's a crazy situation that he's going to have to deal with. I think having him in the gym doing what he does best, training and trying to keep that side of his life going, is a good thing. [I] Talked to him briefly, but not about the incident but about the situation. He said, ‘I'll be back, I'm going to be back.' I believe him, there's no doubt. I think there's a good chance. In his mind, he's fighting again.
Malki Kawa, Jones's manager, recently hinted at the possibility Jones would never fight again. When speaking with Ariel Helwani, he claimed there is a chance the 27-year-old legend quietly rides off into the sunset, leaving his perfect fighting career forever frozen in time.
But we won't be fooled by those odds. Walking away from competition isn't an easy feat for most athletes, especially world-class ones like Jones. The fire to compete is the one thing that transcends even Father Time. Former athletes grow old and reminisce on past glory, wishing they could turn back the clock.
The same fire burns within Jones, who continues to grind away in the gym, according to Condit.
In a strange way, Jones has been forced back to his roots. Anthony “Rumble” Johnson and Daniel Cormier will compete for the light heavyweight title on Saturday at UFC 187. The burden of being a champion has been lifted from Jones' shoulders.
For the first time in a long time, he gets to slow down and look at his career through a more objective lens. When did everything go sideways? What ever happened to that unassuming, eager fighter taking it all in bit by bit, graciously enjoying the moment?
No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life. Those same trials and tribulations increase exponentially when wealth and power gets involved. Like hip-hop legend The Notorious B.I.G. said, “Mo Money Mo Problems.” Distance isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes it helps us get back what was lost.
If a timeout is the cure, so be it. The vintage Jon Jones is definitely worth saving.

UPDATE 3/7 11 a.m. PT: We mentioned we were a little hesitant to believe a fan report and it seems as if we had good reason. If you read through the comments attached to Maynard Keenan's latest Instagram posting , you'll see he responds to a fan who mentions the report about the album with, “Joke. Pure Joke. Not even close to done.”
The guitarist who made the comment also says it was a joke:
hello greg. fyi "the record's done and its coming out tomorrow" is what i said yesterday followed by "just kidding"… — adam jones (@AdamJones_tv) March 7, 2014
Psych-metal act Tool is two shows into a tour that has seen the band fill setlists with older material, despite having a new album in the works. So what's up with the new album, which would be the group's first since 2006's 10,000 Days? Well, according to Crave Online, guitarist Adam Jones told a fan at a VIP meet-and-greet that the LP is “100% done” and should be released later this year.
The only other information Crave Online reports about the album is that it contains material with “different time signatures than their previous work.” We do warn that the information in the publication's report comes via a fan, not directly from Jones.
Last night Tool performed at the Moda Center in Portland, OR. The only change from Tuesday's night show is that the group opened with “Third Eye” in Portland as opposed to the “Hooker With A Penis” opener in Spokane.
Here's the setlist from last night's show:
February 11, 1840.
Donizetti was premiering his latest work, a French comedy known as “La Fille du Regiment.” Among his works, it was a true rarity in its approach to style. He had a lot banking on this work, looking to fully establish his reputation in the cultural capital of the world.
But it was a disaster.
One of the big reasons? The lead tenor, Mécène Marié de l'Isle, was frequently out of tune throughout the evening.
The opera itself eventually survived and remains a popular fixture in the modern-day repertoire. A showcase for both the lead soprano and tenor, the work is perhaps best-known for the challenging aria “Ah! Mes amis, quell jour de fête!” which features nine high C's for the tenor.
Many tenors have dominated the role throughout the years. Here are the most famous Kings of Tonio's high C's.
Alfredo Kraus
The Spanish tenor was not famous for the role but he performed throughout his career. Unlike the other tenors on this list, Kraus' high C's have tremendous weight to them, his voice having a darker color. He left behind a recording of the opera with June Anderson.
Luciano Pavarotti
The tenor came to ascendance singing this very role. He first sang in 1966 at the Royal Opera House, garnering the title of “King of the High Cs.” He would strike gold at the Met in 1972, singing this very role and driving people crazy after his nine high C's. The tenor received 17 curtain calls after that run.
He left a famed recording with Joan Sutherland under Richard Bonynge from 1967.
Juan Diego Flórez
In the modern era, Flórez is undeniably the most famous exponent of the role, singing it around the world and even leaving two recordings. The former is a DVD alongside Natalie Dessay from the Royal Opera House in 2007. There is also a CD recording from Vienna from the same year. The duo also performed the opera at the Metropolitan Opera in 2008 where Flórez would encore the aria, breaking a decades-long tradition of not doing encores at the house. He would also sing another run with Diana Damrau at the Met.
Lawrence Brownlee
The tenor stepped in for Flórez during one run at the Met and immediately became a hit in the role, getting a run at the Met and then becoming the go-to Tonio around the world in recent years. He has a recording of the aria in his new album, “Allegro io son.”
Here are the four tenors here:
Ahead of the elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Bharatiya Janata Party is making all attempts to woo Mumbai's Muslims to enhance its tally in the civic body. Nearly 25,000 Muslim youths are likely to join the BJP next week, claims the party.

According to BJP leaders, these Muslim youths are from areas such as Malvani, Bandra (W) and Bandra (E), Mohammed Ali Road, Madanpura, Kurla, Govandi and other areas who will join the party at a function to be organised next week. The function is likely to be organised in South Mumbai.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said he wanted to see a computer in one hand and Quran in other hand of the Muslim youths, which is why they are attracted to BJP. The community is seeing the work in last two to three years by the BJP government,” said Haider Azam, vice-president of the BJP's Mumbai unit.
Talking about the 25,000 Muslim youths, he said, “We have approached a couple of NGOs working in the social sector in the city while a few organisations have reached out to us expressing willingness to join the party.”
Azam said Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and senior BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain would attend the function.
“All other parties have used the community for their own benefits and have deserted them later. The BJP is only working towards the inclusive development of the community,” he said.
As many as 47 newly elected Muslim councillors and two Muslim presidents of municipal councils will be felicitated at the function. Azam said, “We are planning to organise the programme on December 28 or 29. We are meeting Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis tomorrow (Wednesday) to seek his time and will finalise the date after that,” said Azam.

The BJP had recently organised a ‘baati chokha' event to woo north Indian voters. Fadnavis and several other leaders from north India were present at the event organised in Goregaon.
‘Zorin' is a GNU/Linux distribution that I always wanted to try but never had the chance to do so. One of the reasons why I was attracted to it was because its desktop resembled a traditional Microsoft Windows desktop (users can easily make it look like Windows 7, XP or Gnome Classic by using its own ‘Look changer' utility) which is quite deliberately designed to look that way, and that got it somewhat highlighted in the long list of other distributions.
‘Zorin' achieves this default look through a combination of ‘Avant Window Navigator' (application dock), its own theme, Compiz window manager and Gnome 3 applications, mainly. It is based on Ubuntu's core and comes with two versions -- a free and a premium version (which basically ships with more software and few more ‘Zorin' themes), and they both include proprietary multimedia codecs by default.
They also ship a ‘Lite' version based on LXDE desktop (not yet included in the latest release) and an educational version which are both released under the ‘free' version, separately. The system requirements for running ‘Zorin' is also somewhat low (1 GHz processor, 512MiB RAM …) when compared to some other distributions.
For this review, I downloaded the 64-bit version of the latest release (‘8', released in January 27, 2014), the disc image is about 1.6GB. And like always, I was most interested in its performance related details because the looks of an OS means next to nothing if it is not efficient. For the comparison I decided use Ubuntu 13.10 because it is the most popular open-source operating system & ‘Linux Mint 15 Cinnamon‘, since both Zorin and LM 15 seem to be targeting the same audience (due to the appearance of their respective desktops).
Before I begin, below is brief information of my computer's hardware.
Intel Core i3-2330M CPU, Intel HD 3000 GPU, 4GB RAM (DDR3), Toshiba 7200 RPM (320GB) SATA HDD, Intel N-1030 Wireless adapter, Realtek network adapter ('RTL8168'), LED display with 1366x768 resolution (60Hz/60FPS). It's a Dell Vostro V-131 notebook.
The Installer …
Other than the theme and the slightly better fonts used, ‘Zorin' uses Ubuntu's installer so I will not add anything more. That said, I chose the ‘Dvorak' keyboard layout during the installation but it failed to apply it to the installed system because the first time I logged into the desktop it had been replaced by the default one (‘QWERTY'), and I had to add it again for fixing it. The installation time was slightly longer, mostly because of the hardware recognition system took its time (nothing major), other than that, it was all good.
First Boot & the Desktop …
‘Zorin OS 8' uses GRUB and comes with a bright and a beautiful looking Bluish theme. The boot screen also looks very similar (clean & simple), I liked them both.
Then I was greeted with the desktop which as mentioned in the beginning looks very much like the traditional Windows desktop. The ‘AWN' serves as the bottom panel and houses a start-menu, application launcher area, window navigator area and a system tray. Thanks to the colors used, different areas look quite distinctive as well.
You can also bring to front or close a running application by simply hovering over its icon in ‘AWN'.
The start-menu (written by the ‘Zorin' developers), shows applications in categories, recently used files etc and includes a search box. When you put your mouse pointer over the star-menu a tool-tip message is displayed saying ‘Zorin Menu'. It did not go away, even when I was using the search box (unless I clicked on it) and as a result, I could hardly see what I was typing. And while displaying results for a search query there is always a slight delay, where in other distributions such as Linux Mint, displays them almost instantly. I also disliked the start-menu opening animation.
When you switch between windows, the application window that you just switched into ‘shakes' up and down (effect) which I also found to be a distraction. This can be disabled through ‘Compiz settings manager', but if you are a Windows user who just switched to GNU/Linux then it is not something that you are going to be aware of.
The width of the scroll-bars is too small, even when compared to the one that Gnome 3 comes with. That perhaps is because I am used to the ones that ‘Unity' comes with. Nonetheless, I think specially the touchpad users, might struggle with them. These are of course not major issues, but sometimes it is the little things that matter.
I liked the default theme in ‘Zorin' and they have added a brand new, slightly darker version of the default theme with this release as well (shown below).
Since this version of Zorin is based on ‘Gnome 3' (3.8+), the desktop also features a simple right-click context menu as shown below. The wallpaper collection is also pretty decent.
Included Applications …
‘Zorin' 8 comes with LibreOffice 4.1.3.2, GIMP 2.8, Gnome Image Viewer 3.8.2, Document Viewer 3.10.0, Shotwell 0.15.0, Simple Scan 3.10.2, Google Chrome 32.0.1700.77, Thunderbird 24.2.0, Empathy 3.8.4, Ubuntu Software Center 13.10, ‘apt-get' 0.9.9, Play On Linux 4.2.2 (a tool that lets native Windows programs to be run in GNU/Linux -- well, at least some of them), Brasero 3.8.0, Cheese 3.8.3 (web cam recorder), OpenShot 1.4.3.
‘Zorin 8', for the first time uses ‘Music' 2.0.4 -- the default music manager of Elementary OS.
For video playback you have Totem 3.8.2. And as mentioned previously, ‘Zorin' can play all the proprietary codecs and also includes Adobe Flash player as well.
Zorin Applications …
‘Zorin' also features few applications of its own. First we have the ‘Look Changer' which lets you change you desktop style to ‘Windows 7', ‘XP or ‘Gnome Classic'. Then the ‘Theme Changer' for changing between the two built-in themes. And finally ‘Web Browser Manager' that lets users install Firefox, Opera and Midori easily.
Performance Details …
I measured performance related details first (without ‘touching' the OS. Except I had disabled ‘software-updater' periodic update checking for maintaining a solid memory usage readings). I also ran each test 5 times for obtaining average readings.
Boot Speed …
Being based on Ubuntu's core, ‘Zorin OS 8' also uses ‘ureadhead' (a tool that can significantly improve the boot-up times). But as you can see, even with it running, it was the slowest to boot (39% slower than LM 15 and 81% slower when compared to Ubuntu 13.10!).
Although it should not be a huge factor, it is worth mentioning that ‘Zorin' comes with ‘preload‘ (a tool that speeds up application loading times which can affect the boot-up speeds, slightly).
Memory Usage Upon Desktop Loading …
As shown, ‘Zorin OS 8' used 43% more RAM when compared to LM 15 & 13% when put up against Ubuntu 13.10.
CPU Usage at Idle …
CPU usage readings were also good in ‘Zorin' at idle, except for the ‘gnome-system-monitor' that kept consuming 3-4% (though I will not hold it against ‘Zorin' as it is a fault in the Gnome-3 system monitor. I have seen it doing that in other distributions), other processes simply leave the CPU alone.
Power Usage at Idle …
I measured the power usage using ‘powerstat'. I had turned-off Bluetooth, disabled automatic screen turning-off & dimming, kept the screen at the maximum brightness, and had Wi-Fi running (connected to my Wi-Fi router). But as you can see, ‘Zorin OS 8' was the most power hungry of the bunch. In fact, it was the most power consuming distribution that I have used so far. As for the conditions that created it, I do not have an answer.
Note: I used the data from Ubuntu 13.04 here as I do not have power consumption details of Ubuntu 13.10.
System Responsiveness …
I ran my standard test for observing the OS's responsiveness which involves opening multiple programs while a large file is being copied and then observing the smoothness of the mouse pointer movements. So while a 1.4GB file was being copied (within the ‘Home' folder) I opened a video file through Totem.
Then I clicked on the start-menu and opened LibreOffice Writer, OpenShot, Terminal by searching for them. I also opened Google Chrome, Ubuntu Software Center and system monitor by navigating the menus. I also right-clicked on the desktop and opened the background changer as well.
So how did it all go ?
The underlying desktop applications being Gnome-3, ‘Zorin OS 8' did not disappoint me. Although the video playback was interrupted several times (I have had other distributions that played a multimedia file without any interruptions, such as ‘KaOS 2014‘) the OS was able to keep the overall responsiveness at a very satisfying level (excellent mouse pointer movements included!).
Hardware Recognition and ACPI …
Except for the fingerprint reader (not yet supported by Linux), all the other hardware were recognized correctly by ‘Zorin OS 8', though just like in Ubuntu, the screen brightness gets reset to maximum upon each desktop login. Suspending does not take more than a second or a two either, nice.
Shutdown Delay …
‘Zorin' rocked the shutdown delay test as it was the fastest to-do so!. Although being based on Ubuntu 13.10, sometimes the process takes about 9-12 seconds. Again I will not hold it against ‘Zorin' as it is clearly the Ubuntu core's fault (it happens in Ubuntu also).
Final Words …
Nothing is perfect, an OS that one dislikes might be loved by someone else. And I also am aware of how much a tedious task it is maintaining a distribution, so I do not want to disrespect the hard work of ‘Zorin' developers either. However, it is quite difficult to always see the best in everything, thus from the short experience that I had while using ‘Zorin OS 8', I will say this much.
If you are looking for a free operating system that is fast, lightweight, responsive, mobile friendly, beautiful and one that resembles a traditional Windows desktop, then ‘Linux Mint Cinnamon' edition is your best choice.
But that is just the opinion of a single individual, derived from the short experience that he had. So, if you own a desktop computer, hope to run some MS Windows applications (because ‘Zorin' includes ‘Play On Linux' by default) and willing to accept some of its drawbacks, then I see no reason why you should not try ‘Zorin' either.

When you think of NASA launches, you probably think of Florida and shuttle missions and massive rockets blasting into the sky. But NASA is busy launching all sorts of smaller projects that don't attract as much of the space glory. On January 26, the space agency sent four suborbital sounding rockets up into the sky from the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska.
A time-lapse composite image shows all four rocket launches as bright trails leading up into misty green aurora-filled skies. The otherworldy image shows stars streaking in a circular pattern, a green Lidar streak and frost-covered ground and foliage.
The launches were part of the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere Turbulence Experiment (M-TeX) and the Mesospheric Inversion-layer Stratified Turbulence (MIST) experiment. The rockets were designed to leave vapor trails that could be observed and tracked from the ground. NASA created the experiments to "investigate and enhance our understanding of how meteorological processes control the impact of solar processes on the Earth's atmosphere." Researchers hope to gain insights into the movement of air and changing temperatures in the atmosphere.
It's par for the course for NASA's scientific endeavors to also generate images that captivate and amaze space fans and the general public alike. The Hubble Space Telescope alone has been responsible for countless stunning views out into the wider universe. The rocket image from Alaska brings NASA's work a little closer to home, but it's just as stunning as a glimpse into a far away nebula or galaxy.
Updated. In 2012 we're going to see the emergence of a “turbo” button on our mobile phones. Verizon Wireless(s vz)(s vod) is developing a network API that would allow customers to buy temporary bursts of bandwidth on their phones, giving priority to their video streams or downloads even during the most congested network conditions. On Thursday, Leap Wireless(s leap) CEO Doug Hutcheson revealed at a Citigroup(s C) conference that its mobile carrier Cricket would offer a similar bandwidth boost option.
Cricket Both operators plans to implement their its turbo button s this year, while Verizon has not set a launch date, but they plan to position them differently. Verizon's will be a premium service for customers looking for speeds beyond the norm, while Cricket's will be a means for customers to reclaim their regular data speeds after customers use up their monthly gigabyte quotas and are throttled down to the equivalent of dial-up modem access. (Update: Verizon clarified to us on Monday that, contrary to earlier reports, its turbo technology is still deep in the labs, and it hasn't settled on a timeframe for commercial release or a specific business model.) But they both accomplish the same thing: giving customers a bandwidth oomph beyond what they would get from their normal data plans.

A turbo button is an intriguing concept. Most of the data services I use on my phone – Twitter, e-mail, web browsing, Pandora(s P) — don't require a stellar mobile broadband connection, but for some apps the network's best effort isn't good enough. If there is a video I'm aching to see or a big download I want to speed up, having the option to pay a few cents to a dollar for instant gratification might be worth it.
What about the other guy?
There's a trade off. The wireless network is a shared resource, so every packet of mine that gets prioritized means someone else's packet is getting de-prioritized. If you're in a congested cell where a bunch of other people have temporarily turbo-charged their phones, your network connection has to make up the difference, sticking you with even slower speeds than normal.
This kind of data management policies are starting to make their way in to mobile networks and they could result in a new order of data plan tiers, based on quality of connection rather than gigabyte tonnage consumed. Tekelec (s TKLC), which develops the policy management technology behind Verizon's turbo button, believes we're going to see a lot more ways to slice and dice data in the near future. In a recent interview with GigaOM, Tekelec CTO and VP of engineering Doug Suriano said we can expect to see operators start offering “upside down” data plans, which will allow customers to customize their plans – and the prices they pay – based on the types of applications they use and the times they typically use them.
The next type of pricing policy we're likely to see, Suirano said, will be the opposite of a turbo button: the equivalent of a network brake. Rather than pay more money to get temporarily faster speeds, customers may be willing to pay less money to temporarily suffer sluggish bandwidth. Customers often would enjoy the same robust speeds as their full-fare counterparts, but when the network gets congested their data traffic would be the first be deprioritized, clearing the capacity fast lanes for premium turbo subscribers, Suriano said. He used Verizon as a hypothetical example for such a service:
Verizon Wireless has a reputation for providing a quality service to all customers, so for any premium customer there will be mechanisms in the phone to ensure that you always have a ‘Verizon-quality' experience. But if you want to pay $10 to $20 less a month for data, Verizon could offer you a service that's good for most of the things you want to do with your phone, but doesn't always guarantee you that Verizon level of quality.
Could prioritization be the answer to data caps?
What's particularly interesting about such a scenario is it might revive what a practically extinct concept in mobile: the unlimited plan. While there is a set cost for to delivering any megabyte of data to a customer, the really expensive thing for an operator is to deliver a megabyte each to hundreds of customers in the same cell. It's a matter of network scale and load balancing. If you're wandering around the streets of your city's financial district at 4 AM, the network is wide open, its capacity lying dormant. But at Noon that same network is overloaded.
If an operator had a way to ensure that customers' speeds were downgraded only when other customers were vying for that same capacity, then it could open up the data spigots, offering unlimited, though restricted, access — or at least a whole bunch of gigabytes for cheap. But such a policy might produce its own problem of scale. If everyone is accessing the network all of the time, then the network is always congested and everyone's traffic — except for that of a few premium customers — gets de-prioritized to oblivion. To make it work, operators would need to strike a delicate balance between the network capacity they can feasibly build and the way their customers access it.
Of course, any time you start talking about prioritizing certain types of traffic over others, controversy ensues. Wireless carriers may not be bound by the same net neutrality restrictions their wireline counterparts face, but that doesn't mean they aren't vulnerable to the ire of their customers. Preferential treatment of one person's packets over another's could create a stratified mobile Internet, with an upper class that's willing to pay to access what they want, when they want and lower class left with the network's scraps. Depending on how operators implement these new pricing policies, they could spark a revolution in the pricing and availability of mobile data or they could create data apartheid.

Colorado state police arrested 23 people early this morning, hours after officers began forcibly evicting protesters from the “Occupy Denver” camp in front of the state's capitol.
Individuals arrested were facing likely charges of “unlawful conduct on public land,” according to The Denver Post. Several others were being charged with assault and impeding traffic.
The video below shows the scene from the early hours of Friday morning.
Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) claimed on Thursday morning that the police action was needed to ensure the protesters' health and safety. Following the eviction, police said they plan to maintain a constant presence in the park to prevent protesters from returning.
Protesters have since taken their demonstration to the sidewalks surrounding the park, which are administered by the city.
The video below is from The Denver Post, published Friday, Oct. 14, 2011.

The ever advancing technology of the 3D-Printer has reached new heights with this: The World's Tallest 3D-Printed Building from Shanghai-based construction firm WinSun Decoration Design Engineering.
The company has unveiled a five-story apartment building that has been made entirely with a giant 3D printer. The building has a terra cotta brick-like exterior and is on display at the Suzhou Industrial Park.
The industrial park also houses a 1,100-square-meter (11,840-square-foot) 3D-printed neoclassical mansion, ‘manufactured' by the same company.
Both buildings were made with a patented “ink” that is created from recycled construction waste. The printer is a colossal 150 meters long.
The company is a pioneer in the 3d printing construction world. Last year it printed 10 affordable single-story houses in 24 hours. These advances have quite rightly captured the attention of architects, humanitarian aid agencies, and governments across the globe in the pursuit of affordable housing.

Regulations For A New Industry
But what about safety? According to the chief engineer in charge of inspecting the buildings (Ma Rongquan, of Chinese Construction) both structures are in compliance with national standards.
However, it has prompted the argument that new standards may need to be written in the face of emerging 3D-printed architecture. “We need to revise and improve such a standard for the future,” Rongquan told the 3D-printing-focused blog 3Ders.
[hr]
Orders are being made. Ten houses have been ordered by a Taiwanese real estate group, while 20,000 of the affordable single-story houses are being prepared for the Egyptian government.
The company is clearly going from strength to strength and is certainly receiving worldwide coverage for the efforts.
At a press conference earlier this month, WinSun CEO Ma Yi He announced the company's plans to build 3D construction factories in more than 20 countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E, Qatar, Morocco, and Tunisia.

Bengals defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer, believed to be the front-runner in the Vikings coaching search, is scheduled to arrive in the Twin Cities on Tuesday for a second interview that will include the team's ownership.
Rick Spielman, the Vikings general manager, is in the third week of an extensive hunt for the successor of Leslie Frazier, who was fired Dec. 30.
Zimmer, 57, has been an NFL assistant for 20 seasons, including the past 14 as a defensive coordinator for three teams: Dallas, where he worked with Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells for four seasons; Atlanta; and Cincinnati, where he revived a dormant defense and helped the Bengals post three consecutive playoff seasons for the first time in franchise history.
Zimmer has interviewed for several head coaching vacancies and come up short in recent years. According to the Tennesseean, he had a second interview with the Titans on Monday, just hours before Tennessee hired Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt.
Zimmer never has been a head coach in the NFL or in college, where he spent 15 seasons as an assistant at Missouri, Weber State and Washington State. Two other finalists are believed to have surfaced, and like Zimmer they are NFL defensive coordinators: the Cardinals' Todd Bowles and the Seahawks' Dan Quinn.
They are among the seven candidates Spielman has interviewed. Bowles is available immediately for a second interview, which might take place this week if the Vikings don't move quickly to hire Zimmer. Quinn would not be available until next week because the Seahawks are in Sunday's NFC Championship Game.
No second interview had been scheduled with Bowles as of late Monday, according to John Wooten, chairman of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which helps promote minority hiring in the NFL.
Also in Sunday's NFC title game and unavailable until next week are two 49ers assistants, offensive coordinator Greg Roman and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula. They interviewed with Spielman on Saturday in Charlotte, N.C., the day before their playoff victory over the Panthers.
Also known to have interviewed with Spielman are Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Browns defensive coordinator Ray Horton. The Vikings had interest in Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase, but he has refused all interview requests until after Denver's season is over.
Zimmer's NFL career began as a Cowboys defensive backs coach. He was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2000 and held that post through 2006, coaching under Parcells during the last four seasons.
Zimmer led the Cowboys to top-10 finishes in yards allowed using both the 4-3 and 3-4 schemes. In 2003, they ranked No. 1.
Zimmer moved on to Atlanta as defensive coordinator in 2007 before joining the Bengals in 2008.
Before he arrived, the Bengals had one top-10 defensive ranking in the previous 18 seasons. They have achieved that feat in four of the past five years under Zimmer, including a No. 3 ranking (305.5) this season.
Note
Vikings wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson was named to the All-NFL and All-NFC teams by the Pro Football Writers of America on Monday. Patterson was the only Vikings selection on either team. The rookie, one of 17 first time All-NFL honorees, broke the franchise record for most kickoff return yards (1,393).
RALEIGH, NC – Ron Francis , Executive Vice President and General Manager of the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes, today announced that the team has recalled defenseman Danny Biega from the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League (AHL).
Biega, 24, played 10 games on the NHL level for the Hurricanes in 2014-15, totaling two assists. The Montreal native also appeared in 69 games for Charlotte, totaling two goals and 12 assists (14 points). Selected by the Hurricanes in the third round, 67th overall, of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, Biega has totaled 32 points (5g, 27a) in 135 career AHL games with the Checkers. He spent four seasons at Harvard prior to turning professional, totaling 85 points (28g, 57a) in 132 games and earning All-American honors during his senior season.

Hey, you.
I just wanted to let you know this: You are not lazy. You never have been.
Still, you doubt this. You feel it gnawing in yourself as you fret over where your day has gone and where it's going. It doesn't matter if the day has just started or if it's three in the afternoon or if you're sitting, stress-stricken, in front of your laptop at 6 PM–the anxiety is there that no matter what you've done, you're fundamentally lazy. And the fundamentally lazy are among the most loathed creatures on earth.
You might as well be eating bon-bons in bed while watching Netflix all day. (And if you are? I bet you have a damn good reason for doing so.)
Maybe you're disabled or ill or both. You receive benefits. But that's hazard pay–it's the check in the mail that you get for the dangerous life of healing that you live. It doesn't mean you're lazy.
Maybe you're as well as you can be, physically, but you suspect your adrenals are shot and maybe you have an ulcer and those headaches are migraines that don't quit and through it all you suspect your own poisonous laziness, this insidious power that means all of your work has been for naught; you are worthless. No. You are not worthless. Look at what you've done. An email! Do you know how much effort writing an email expends? I want to throw a goddamn party for you. Look at you, getting through life the best you can. Just look at your magnificent self in the mirror. Give it a kiss. Give that not-lazy mug a sloppy kiss.
Maybe you're working yourself to the bone and you suspect you could be doing more, more, more, in which case I want to swaddle you in my diamond-print quilt and whisper, Hush, hush, you are okay, you are wonderful, you are doing the best that you can and I want to commend you for that.
You are not lazy, sweetheart.
The idea of laziness was, I suspect, invented by the same people who love to dangle Hell over our heads in response to anything deemed vaguely inappropriate. I have more respect for Hell-mongerers than I do for laziness-mongerers, in fact; at least the idea of Hell is borne out of the concept of actual despair, as far as I can tell, whereas laziness is a whip wielded in order to make sure you produce more than a human being is physically capable of producing while slowly disintegrating from the inside out.
I say this because I know the fear: I worry every day that I'm lazy, and I'm tired of it.
We're all doing the best we can. You are doing the best you can. You are doing an amazing job. You are not lazy in the slightest.
Keep going. You're doing great.
Make it mythic,
P.S. I have a guest post over on Beth's lovely Little Red Tarot site today, called Running a Flourishing Business (Despite Chronic Illness). Please do check it out.
Pigeons fly in front of the Tian'anmen Rostrum after the Chinese national flag-raising ceremony in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 1, 2016. Over 100,000 people from across the country gathered at the Tian'anmen Square to watch the national flag-raising ceremony on the morning of Oct. 1, marking the 67th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Half of Americans now view China favorably, the highest rating since 1989, found a Gallup released Thursday.
This is up from 44 percent in 2016 and 41 percent in 2012, found the Feb. 1-5 Gallup poll.
China's favorable rating by Americans was only 38 in 1985 but registered 72 percent in Gallup's poll in February 1989, taken days after former U.S. President George H. W. Bush returned from a diplomatic visit to China. It had remained at the low 40s for most of the time since 1989, according to Gallup.
The six-percentage-point rise in China's overall favorability from last year is explained by increases among both Democrats and Republicans, Gallup said.
The poll found that 58 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents view China favorably. Though only 38 percent of Republicans view China favorably, it is still up by 10 percentage points from 2016.
The U.S.-China relations have never been entirely smooth in the past decades due to tensions over Taiwan, nuclear arms, human rights and other incidents, and the election of Republican candidate Donald Trump as president adds more complexity to the relations, Gallup noted.
Though the future of U.S.-China relations is unclear, "it may be helpful for the new administration to know that Americans are feeling relatively positively toward China right now, and thus may be less receptive to a hard-nosed approach to U.S.-China relations," Gallup said.
Now playing: Watch this: The Motorola Moto G is a colourful bargain
Motorola Mobility apparently couldn't wait for its low-cost Moto G to hit the States.
The Moto G went on sale in the US on Tuesday, available only in the GSM variant and unlocked on Motorola.com for $179 without a contract.
The surprise launch comes well ahead of the company's previously planned target of getting the Moto G out in the US by January. Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside told CNET that early demand for the phone has been strong overseas. The company was able to ramp up the manufacturing process faster than anticipated, and it was able to get the Web site up faster, allowing for the early release of the phone. By launching now, Motorola also takes advantage of the holiday shopping season.
That doesn't take away from its plans for the first quarter. Motorola's carrier and retail partners will launch the Moto G in January, just in time to take advantage of the traditionally strong prepaid market early in the year. While Verizon Wireless has committed to selling the Moto G for its prepaid brand, Woodside said the LTE-less phone would get "broad distribution" with multiple partners. (He declined to name names.)
"We were always gearing up for a big first quarter, but we think we'll have success this quarter as well," Woodside said.
Moto G is the low-cost brother to the more ambitious Moto X , which is primarily sold in the US and stands out because customers can tweak how the device looks with different colors and accents.
The Moto G, however, could end up selling better because it already has a broad array of partners around the world, and the phone's price tag is attractive given the quality of the device.

Woodside declined to comment on sales volume of the Moto X, but he did note the challenges that come from building a brand from scratch.
"It's like launching the Corvette for the first time," he said. "It takes a little while for people to know what the Corvette stands for and to decide if it's right for them."
Regardless of the sales, Woodside understands that positioning the Moto X for success is a long game. He said the Moto Maker capability has helped spur interest in the device, and noted that nearly 1 million people visited Motorola's Web site to tinker with the customization tool. Even if that interest doesn't translate into immediate sales, it does build awareness. He said anyone hardly visited the Motorola site before Google took it over.
Neither the Moto G nor Moto X are sold in China, a result of the Chinese government's ban on Google services, which flow into its phones. Woodside wouldn't close the door on Motorola phones making a comeback in China -- they previously had a strong position in the market, and the brand still holds some sway there -- but he said there were no plans to pursue that region.
As for the future of the Moto X franchise, he said the next step in customization will be the color, finish, and material of the phones. Ultimately, he would like to offer consumers the ability to choose their own screen size, processor speed, and memory, but he said there are a lot of complications and a lack of standards to make it all work. The company is only beginning to create those standards now.
Motorola's Project Ara is the company's push to get to that ultimate goal, but Woodside's comments suggest that's still a long way off.
As for more immediate possibilities, Woodside talked about tablets, noting that "it is always something we're looking at," but said that the company wouldn't put out a product unless it could put a different spin on it.
"There's some exploration, but nothing we can talk about right now," he said.
Lastly, Woodside weighed in on the possibility of Motorola creating a Nexus phone. He is open to working with his parent company's Android team, and doesn't believe it crosses a line for Motorola to participate. But for now, it doesn't appear as if Motorola is in the running for a Nexus device.
"That's something that's more a conversation for (Android, Chrome, and Google apps chief Sundar Pichai)," he said.
It is now pretty well accepted that open source is a superior way of producing software. Almost everyone is doing open source these days. In particular, the ability for users to look under the hood and make changes results in tools that are better adapted to their workflows. It reduces the cost and risk of finding yourself locked in with a vendor in an unbalanced relationship. It contributes to a virtuous circle of continuous improvement, blurring the lines between consumers and producers. It enables everyone to remix and invent new things. It adds up to the common human knowledge.
And yet
And yet, a lot of open source software is developed on (and with the help of) proprietary services running closed-source code. Countless open source projects are developed on GitHub, or with the help of JIRA for bug tracking, Slack for communications, Google Docs for document authoring and sharing, Trello for status boards. That sounds a bit paradoxical and hypocritical—a bit too much "do what I say, not what I do." Why is that? If we agree that open source has so many tangible benefits, why are we so willing to forfeit them with the very tooling we use to produce it?
But it's free!
The argument usually goes like this: Those platforms may be proprietary, they offer great features, and they are provided free of charge to my open source project. Why on Earth would I go through the hassle of setting up, maintaining, and paying for infrastructure to run less featureful solutions? Or why would I pay for someone to host it for me? The trick is, as the saying goes, when the product is free, you are the product. In this case, your open source community is the product.
In the worst case scenario, the personal data and activity patterns of your community members will be sold to third parties. In the best case scenario, your open source community is recruited by force into an army that furthers the network effect and makes it even more difficult for the next open source project to not use that proprietary service.
In all cases, you, as a project, decide to not bear the direct cost, but ask each and every one of your contributors to pay for it indirectly instead. You force all of your contributors to accept the ever-changing terms of use of the proprietary service in order to participate in your "open" community.
Recognizing the trade-off
It is important to recognize the situation for what it is: a trade-off. On one side, shiny features and convenience. On the other, a lock-in of your community through specific features, data formats, proprietary protocols or just plain old network effect and habit.
Each situation is different. In some cases, the gap between the proprietary service and the open platform will be so large that it makes sense to bear the cost. Google Docs is pretty good at what it does, and I find myself using it when collaborating on something more complex than Etherpads or Ethercalcs. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there is really no reason to use Doodle when you can use Framadate. In the same vein, Wekan is close enough to Trello that you should really consider it as well. For Slack versus Mattermost versus IRC, the trade-off is more subtle.
As a side note, the cost of lock-in is a lot reduced when the proprietary service is built on standard protocols. For example, Gmail is not that much of a problem because it is easy enough to use IMAP to integrate it (and possibly move away from it in the future). If Slack was just a stellar opinionated client using IRC protocols and servers, it would also not be that much of a problem.
Part of the solution
Any simple answer to this trade-off would be dogmatic. You are not unpure if you use proprietary services, and you are not wearing blinders if you use open source software for your project infrastructure. Each community will answer that trade-off differently, based on their roots and history.
The important part is to acknowledge that nothing is free. When the choice is made, we all need to be mindful of what we gain, and what we lose. To conclude, I think we can all agree that all other things being equal, when there is an open source solution which has all the features of the proprietary offering, we all prefer to use that. The corollary is, we all benefit when those open source solutions get better.
So to be part of the solution, consider helping those open source projects build something as good as the proprietary alternative, especially when they are pretty close to it feature-wise. That will make solving that trade-off a lot easier.

Taking place this week alongside the consumer electronics clamor is the annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF) at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Though it has and continues to be first and foremost a developers conference, IDF also offers Intel a chance to unveil new products, and in more recent editions discuss and promote their plans for further breaking into the mobile market.
Diving right into the subject of Intel's Core microarchitecture, with the Broadwell based Core M already in the process of launching, Intel is giving developers and the public a look at what comes after Broadwell. Already on Intel's roadmaps for some time, Intel took to the stage at IDF14 to formally announce their next-generation Skylake architecture and to demonstrate its status.
Intel's Tick-Tock Cadence Microarchitecture Process Node Tick or Tock Release Year Conroe/Merom 65nm Tock 2006 Penryn 45nm Tick 2007 Nehalem 45nm Tock 2008 Westmere 32nm Tick 2010 Sandy Bridge 32nm Tock 2011 Ivy Bridge 22nm Tick 2012 Haswell 22nm Tock 2013 Broadwell 14nm Tick 2014 Skylake 14nm Tock 2015
In Intel terminology Skylake is the Tock to Broadwell's Tick, offering a new microarchitecture atop the 14nm process first introduced with Broadwell. As is the case with every Core update, for Skylake Intel is shooting for significant increases in performance, power efficiency, and battery life. Since Skylake is built on the same 14nm process as Broadwell, Skylake is primarily an exercise in Intel's architecture development capabilities, with its gains needing to come from optimizations in design rather than significant manufacturing improvements.
At roughly a year out from launch Intel is not saying anything about the architecture or design at this time, but they are using IDF to showcase that Skylake is up and running. Demonstrating this, Intel showcased a pair of Skylake development systems. The first of which was a traditional open laboratory testbed that was running 3DMark, which was being used to showcase that the GPU and CPU portions of Skylake were running and performing well. The second demonstration was a completed laptop that was playing back 4K video, and is an early version of the hardware Intel will be shipping as the software development vehicle for developers next year.
Alongside their demonstration, Intel also announced a rough timeline for the volume production and availability of Skylake. Volume production will take place in H2'2015, with product availability slated for later in the year. With Broadwell being behind schedule due to a slower than planned bring-up of their 14nm process, there has been some question over what would happen with Skylake and Intel clearly wanted to address this head-on.
Consequently a big part of Intel's message on Skylake is that the next generation CPU is already up and running and is in a healthy state, apparently unfazed by the earlier 14nm delays that dogged Broadwell. At the same time the H2'2015 launch date for Skylake means that it's going to be out roughly a year after the first Broadwell parts, which means Intel still intends to adhere to their roughly 1 year product replacement cadence.
The Army is encouraging personnel of all ranks to go online and collaboratively rewrite seven of its field manuals. And on Aug. 17, the Department of Defense unveiled a Web site promoting links to its blogs and its Flickr, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube sites.
The Web, however, is a big place. And the many thousands of troops who use blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites to communicate with the outside world are not always in tune with the Pentagon's official voice. Policing their daily flood of posts, videos and photographs is virtually impossible — but that has not stopped some in the military from trying.
The Department of Defense, citing growing concerns about cybersecurity, plans to issue a new policy in the coming weeks that is widely expected to set departmentwide restrictions on access to social networking sites from military computers. People involved with the department's review say the new policy may limit access to social media sites to those who can demonstrate a clear work need, like public information officers or family counselors.
If that is the case, many officials say, it will significantly set back efforts to expand and modernize the military's use of the Web just as those efforts are gaining momentum. And while the new policy would not apply to troops who use private Internet providers, a large number of military personnel on bases and ships across the world depend on their work computers to gain access to the Internet.
To many analysts and officers, the debate reflects a broader clash of cultures: between the anarchic, unfiltered, bottom-up nature of the Web and the hierarchical, tightly controlled, top-down tradition of the military.
“We as an institution still haven't come to grips with how we want to use blogging” and other social media, said Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the commander of the Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.
One of the Army's leading advocates for more open access to the Web, General Caldwell argues that social networking allows interaction among enlisted soldiers, junior officers and generals in a way that was unthinkable a decade ago.

He requires students at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth to blog, and the college now sponsors 40 publicly available blogs, including his own, where policies are freely debated.

But getting approval for those blogs, as well as for YouTube and Facebook access at the college, was a struggle. “At every corner, someone cited a regulation,” General Caldwell said. In recent months, however, “the Army has made quantum leaps” in embracing the Web, he added.
Noah Shachtman, editor of Wired.com's national security blog, Danger Room, which has reported extensively on the new policy review, said he recently asked students at West Point whether they would allow soldiers to blog. Almost every cadet said no.

“Then I asked, ‘How many of you think you can stop the flow of information from your soldiers?' ” Mr. Shachtman recalled. “Everybody agreed there is no way to stop this information from going out anyway. So there is this sort of dual-headedness.”
Skeptics of the Pentagon review say it is motivated partly by a desire among certain officials to exert control over the voices of troops on the Web.
Since the advent of military blogging during the Iraq war, some commanders have remained uncomfortable with the art form, citing concerns about both security and decorum.
Over the years, blogs have been censored or shut down, and several years ago the Army instituted requirements that bloggers register with their commanding officers and submit posts for review. As a result, some bloggers say, blogs have become tamer — or, as in the case of Mud Puppy's blog, gone underground.
Officials knowledgeable about the review say it is a result of growing concerns at the United States Strategic Command, which oversees the military's use of the Internet, that social networking sites make military computers vulnerable to viruses, hackers, identity thieves, terrorists and even hostile governments. (Those concerns are not focused on the military's secure system for classified material, which does not use the public Internet.)
The review may already be having a chilling effect. The Marine Corps recently restated a ban on using any social media on its network. And the Army, which in June gave some bases access to Facebook, Twitter and other networking sites, recently urged units to avoid creating new social media pages until the final department policy was issued.

Still, even as they consider restricting the troops' access to social media, the most senior Pentagon officials have clearly come to view Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogging as crucial elements of their public information operations.
“This department, I think, is way behind our curve” in using social media, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said in July as he extolled the use of Twitter by Iranian dissidents.
To critics, the Pentagon's social media sites are goofy at best, propagandistic at worst. “It's like your parents' using modern slang and failing miserably,” said Sgt. Selena Coppa, who writes a blog, Active Duty Patriot, which frequently criticizes the Iraq war and, she says, has gotten her into trouble with her superiors.
But to many troops, the deeper question is whether the military will allow personnel in the field to use the sites the Pentagon itself wants to exploit. For a generation raised on the Web, any restrictions will damage morale, those people say.
“What comes out of my blog is the experiences of a soldier right in the middle of all of this,” Mud Puppy (a nickname for military police), who recently returned home to Illinois, wrote in a recent e-mail message. “I think that people need to hear from us, more than they need to hear from the big whigs. War has a cost, and that cost is paid by soldiers.”
Calgary city council has voted to cut $4 million from the police budget because fine revenues have come in higher than expected.
Police just don't need as much taxpayer money. If the police budget reduction is passed on to homeowners, it would lower next year's property tax hike from 5.7 per cent to 5.3 per cent.
"Every year we have seen a surplus in projected revenues from fines and so, you know, as long as people continue to break the law, we'll continue to see this sort of revenues," said Ald. Diane Colley-Urquhart.
But council may decide to spend some of that money on other priorities, such as lowering bus fares for low-income riders. City hall's $3-billion budget must be finalized by the end of this week.
Under the proposed budget, transit service will be boosted, new 911 operators will be hired and the city's new round-the-clock emergency operations centre will open.
The new centre is where city officials can direct responses to situations like flooding, tornadoes or other emergencies. Nenshi has criticized the $2.1-million a year price tag — asking why no one planned for the annual cost to run it.
"I really want to be very clear that administration has been as efficient as they can in thinking about this and also really ask the question why this wasn't baked into the three-year budget already?" Nenshi said.
For the third budget in a row, Ald. Peter Demong is likely to vote against the budget, saying the tax hike is just too high. If the planned tax hike goes ahead, it will add about $80 a year to the average homeowner's property tax bill.
"We have recently put something together and we will announce more detail soon," said Agag. "We have a few manufacturers that have already signed up to it and the names of those manufacturers will be made public in one go soon."
Citroen, via its DS brand, will announce a major partnership with Virgin Racing on Saturday, and other major OEM's are seriously evaluating programs in the Championship for season three in 2016/17 to showcase their electric drivetrain and battery technology.
"The manufacturers are very curious on the evolution of the championship," Agag told Motorsport.com.
"They want to give their opinion on what they would like and also what we should focus on; whether it is cost, autonomy, development of the batteries, etc.
"All of these things will be discussed within this group."
Further details on the group and its members could be revealed next month.
World Championship status
Formula E could become a fully-fledged World Championship in the coming years should major automotive manufacturers come in to the series.
"I think that (World Championship status) will come as a consequence of when and how many OEM's come in to the championship," Agag told Motorsport.com.
"The actual cost of becoming a World Championship is quite high. I can understand that for OEM's it is important and if they want us to do it, then we will do it.
"However, this is not a short-term objective of mine or the championship; it will happen as a natural progression if we maintain a good rate of progress as we are doing now."
Motorsport.com understands that an FIA Championship can only gain world title status if a minimum of three major manufacturers are involved.
London, UK - The number of reported instances of anti-Muslim hate crime in the UK has risen sharply since the murder of a British soldier in London last year, with women wearing traditional Islamic dress most likely to be the victims of abuse and street attacks, according to a new study.
But researchers believe that a widespread lack of trust in the police in Muslim communities and endemic under-reporting of hate crime masks the true scale of the problem, with most Islamophobic incidents, ranging from online trolling to verbal abuse and extreme violence, going unlogged and unpunished.
The publication of the report also comes amid concerns expressed by some Muslims about their safety on British streets following the murder of a female Saudi Arabian student in Colchester last month. Police say the attack may have been religiously motivated because the victim was wearing an abaya.
The study, conducted by researchers at Teesside University, is based on analysis of 734 incidents reported to and verified by caseworkers at Tell MAMA, an organisation monitoring anti-Muslim attacks, over 10 months from May 2013 to the end of February.
They included 23 cases of assault, 13 cases involving extreme violence, 56 attacks on mosques and hundreds of instances of online abuse, with an average of more than two confirmed cases a day.
Matthew Feldman, the co-author of the report, told Al Jazeera that while official figures showed a decline in hate crime generally, anti-Muslim abuse appeared to be bucking that trend.
The majority of abusers were men under the age of 30, although children as young as 10 were among those identified as perpetrators. And while on-the-street hate crime was typically targeted at men, Feldman said 54 percent of cases recorded by Tell MAMA had been reported by women, including many who felt they had been abused because they were wearing headscarves, face veils or other clothing which visibly identified them as Muslim.
"This figure might indicate a greater willingness [among women] to report anti-Muslim attacks. Or, on the other hand, Muslim women could be seen as more visible targets because of the traditional clothing they wear such as the hijab or abaya," he said.
After effects of Rigby murder
The study also highlighted a 400 percent increase in incidents a week after two Muslim converts murdered British soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013.
The attack was strenuously condemned by Muslim organisations but a spike in attacks followed, with one man subsequently convicted of murdering an 82-year-old man, Mohammed Saleem, as he walked home from a mosque in Birmingham, and plotting to bomb three other mosques.
The secretary of one mosque in Essex, attacked at the time by a man armed with a smoke grenade and knives, told Al Jazeera that Muslims were afraid they would become "sitting targets".
Under-reporting is a real problem, so the wider picture is something that is of real concern to us. - Fiyaz Mughal, Tell MAMA
"At this time, many people in Britain felt frightened and victimised," the report concludes.
Fiyaz Mughal, the director of Tell MAMA, said the baseline of incidents remained higher than it had been prior to Rigby's killing, but added that the data only offered a partial picture of the potential levels of abuse routinely encountered by British Muslims.
The UK's official crime survey estimates there are about 278,000 hate crime offences committed annually, including about 185,000 racially or religiously motivated incidents. But it estimates that only 40 percent get brought to the attention of police.
"What we are picking up is a snapshot of what is reported to us over a specific period of time. But under-reporting is a real problem, so the wider picture is something that is of real concern to us," Mughal told Al Jazeera.
Feldman said Tell MAMA's figures highlighted a worrying lack of trust in the police in Muslim communities. He said that just 17 percent of people who had contacted the organisation had also gone to the police, including just four of 135 victims of street attacks.
"That is very concerning and in a sense that is a wider issue about trust in the police or the belief that hate crime will be taken seriously," he said.
Imran Awan, a criminologist at Birmingham City University and the author of another new report examining anti-Muslim abuse on Twitter, said Feldman's concerns chimed with his own research among Birmingham's Muslim communities.
"People are concerned. There is a level of anxiety and fear. Some people say it's just one of those things that we have to get used to. But others say: 'Perhaps I should move to another country,' and that is quite shocking to me," Awan told Al Jazeera. "You have people wondering if they will be targeted because of their beard or their headscarf or because they have a Muslim name."
Systemic patterns
If you look at most of the reports around Islamophobia they focus on attacks on the streets. But it is happening even more online. - Imran Awan, criminologist
Awan said he had identified systematic patterns of abuse targeting Muslims online and called for the use of social media by supporters and sympathisers of far-right movements such as the English Defence League to be taken more seriously.
"It has amplified the problem. If you look at most of the reports around Islamophobia they focus on attacks on the streets. But it is happening even more online and we have to understand the impact that this abuse is having on people. The worry is that we just allow this cyber-hate to permeate."
Concerns about Islamophobic attacks have heightened since the murder on June 17 of Nahid Almanea, a woman from Saudi Arabia studying in Colchester who was stabbed 16 times as she walked to class along a quiet riverside footpath.
Detectives said one of their main lines of inquiry was whether she had been killed because her dress identified her as a Muslim, although they also stressed that jumping to conclusions about the motivations of her murderer was "deeply unhelpful, wrong and dangerous".
But many Muslims have nonetheless perceived the attack as one on their faith.
"Sadly this is not the first attack on a Muslim student in the UK and I fear it may not be the last," said Omar Ali, the president of the Federation of Islamic Student Societies.
"While the motives behind this senseless crime are still under investigation, it seems very likely that this is another crime inspired by Islamophobic hatred, due to the victim's visibly Muslim appearance. Unfortunately, this would correlate with an increasingly disturbing trend of hate crimes against Muslims here in the UK."
New legal initiatives
The British government in May launched a revised action plan to tackle hate crime which acknowledged that Muslim adults were more likely than other adults to be the victims of religiously or racially motivated hate crime.
It cited its support for initiatives challenging Islamophobia such as "regional road shows" and the "Big Iftar", which encourages mosques to open their doors to the wider community during Ramadan.
"Addressing anti-Muslim hatred remains a central theme and our dialogue with local communities is already under way through the roll out of a number of regional road shows.
These events provide the opportunity to promote our work and to allow us to explore what more we can do to tackle the issue," said Norman Baker, the minister for crime prevention.
Mughal said better training was required for police and prosecutors to better understand and recognise Muslim hate crime, and called for all police forces to classify and log it separately to other hate crimes; something currently only undertaken by police in London.
Feldman said that collating data concerning anti-Muslim prejudice was relatively recent and that more work was needed to promote reporting and encourage victims to come forward, citing the example of work done in the Jewish community to tackle anti-Semitic hate crime as an example.
"The question that needs to be asked is whether Muslim communities in this country are living in fear. Anyone, Muslim or not, would say that is unacceptable in any community. That is a glimpse I get when I look at this data, but we need more information."
Earlier today, Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Mike Pence, Governor of Indiana, had been chosen as his vice presidential candidate. Pence, 57, is a deeply traditional choice, he's a standard old-school Republican who hews more closely to the GOP's ideology than Trump. Pence is religious and speaks often of his Christianity as a motivating force behind the controversial laws he's signed during his tenure, including omnibus abortion bill HB 1337 and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a discriminatory bill that prompted numerous boycotts of the state.

The New York Times described Pence as:
[...] a cautious choice of running mate — a political partner who is unlikely to embarrass Mr. Trump, and who may help him shore up support among conservative voters still wary of his candidacy.
There's no doubt that Pence is of the standard Republican issue variety: religious, anti-gay, pro-life, and pro-open trade. His tone and political ideologies seem to depart from Trump on more than a few issues. On social media, many were quick to point out where Pence clearly departs from Trump, including bans on Muslim immigration and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Trump has built his candidacy by presenting himself as the alternative to traditional Republican talking points; he's religious when he needs to be (though terrible at even performing evangelical Christianity), vacillates on abortion, has little to no platform on LGTBQ rights, advocates protectionism and is anti-immigration. Where Trump is all empty anger, the Times described Pence as “low-key.”
Pence is popular with religious conservatives, in particular, anti-abortion advocates. It's likely that Pence will bring the pro-life movement, who have felt alienated from and ignored by Trump, back into the fold. Prior to Trump's official announcement, groups like Indiana Right to Life celebrated the rumors of Pence's selection. “Governor Pence is devoted to protecting the unborn and their mothers,” Indiana Right to Life president said in a statement to the ultra-conservative Life News. “Pence's pro-life stance is more than a talking point; Gov. Pence has put his pro-life position into action time and time again.”
Pence is a bit of a darling among anti-choice groups. As a member of Congress, Pence sponsored a 2007 bill to defund Planned Parenthood, the first of its kind, the legislation set off a now nearly decade old congressional battle to defund the organization. Pence reintroduced the legislation multiple times until he left the House in 2011. “Let the abortion providers provide for themselves,” Pence told Politico in 2007. “I'd like to continue to be a persistent, respectful voice for the sanctity of life.”

It was a template and an indicator of how he would treat women's health as governor of Indiana. As governor, Pence signed virtually every anti-choice bill that was put on his desk, including HB 1337, an omnibus abortion bill that a federal court blocked from taking effect in June of this year.
Pence described the law “a comprehensive pro-life measure that affirms the value of all human life.” In reality, it is a deeply invasive law lacking both empathy and reason (unsurprising, perhaps, from the state that jailed Purvi Patel). HB 1337 bans women from seeking abortions based on race, gender or fetal anomaly; it also mandates that women be required to bury or cremate the fetus post-termination. In addition, it required that abortion doctors have admitting privileges in order to practice, a restriction that the Supreme Court recently struck down in Whole Woman's Health vs. Hellerstedt.
The law was loudly and routinely condemned by pro-choice groups and though the Times might think of Pence as “low key,” women in Indiana certainly do not. After Pence signed HB 1337, a group calling themselves Periods for Pence, protested the invasive bill by calling and tweeting his office details of their menstrual cycles. In a statement, Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, said about Pence's selection:
“The reason anyone in America could pick Mike Pence out of a one-man lineup is because of his long history of targeted political attacks against the care provided at Planned Parenthood health centers in Indiana and across the country. Other than that, he doesn't have a single distinguishing characteristic.”
In 2015, Pence also signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The controversial law prohibits the passage of state laws that “substantially burden” the religious beliefs of individuals. According to the Associated Press, the definition of an “individual” originally included churches and religious institutions, as well as businesses and other entities (RIP Memories Pizza who played themselves all the way to closing).

The law and its passage were a mess, LGBTQ activists argued that the bill would effectively allow business owners to discriminate and deny customers service if they were LGBTQ (or merely if the owner of the business perceived them to be). After numerous companies and organizations, including Angie's List and the NCAA, announced that they would boycott the state, the Indiana legislature amended the bill, clarifying that it could not be used to discriminate against LGTBQ people.
Pence handled the passage of the bill poorly. He acknowledged that the bill was discriminatory, yet signed it anyway and, in the process, lost quite a bit of cash for Indiana businesses. If anything, the RFRA demonstrated the tensions between the pro-business and “pro-family” ideologies that underpin GOP ideology.
Ostensibly Trump's selection of Pence is meant to appeal to the evangelical “pro-family” base of the Republican party, of which Pence is a member. Certainly, Pence has a long history of sponsoring and signing bills that appeal to that demographic, no matter how prejudicial, unconstitutional or invasive they might be. In short, he's the perfect VP selection for a campaign built on those very things.

Update: Jezebel reached out to Periods for Pence to find out what's next for them. In an email, they said they will “move forward” with assistance from “Tampons for Trump.” “We will be contacting Mr. Trump's HQ to check in with our menstrual cycles and any reproductive questions we may have, since choosing Mike Pence automatically means he is extremely interested in this as well. I'm really looking forward to receiving gynecological advice from Donald Trump since he must be such an authority as well. It's great to have the best of the best paying such close attention to my ‘lady needs.'”

A spiritual successor to It, and a Dark Tower novel in all but name, this meditation on time, ageing, free will and predestination is one of King's true masterpieces
In the 1990s, 29 novels into his career, King could do whatever he wanted. His most famous books had been turned into films, he'd had more bestsellers than anybody could hope to dream of, and he'd taken a short hiatus in which he overcame his addictions. He could have followed the publishing dictum “write what sells”, churned out sequels or revisited themes and ideas. The world was hankering (then, as now) for more Pennywise. Instead? In The Dark Half we got a book that bordered on the metafictional, followed by two novels, Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne, that showcased King's desire to represent female characters better.
Then, in 1994, he unleashed Insomnia on the world. I remember buying this one, as with so many King novels, at the airport right before a holiday. I cradled the thing for the whole journey: I didn't have much choice, as it was so big it wouldn't fit into my backpack. And I was excited! Even though Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne had left me a little cold, this – according to the blurb on the back of the book – was a return to King's more conventional horror writing.
But Ralph Roberts, a septuagenarian widower and Insomnia's main character, shocked me a little. I'm not sure I'd read many books with older main characters. Through King, I had been introduced to adult protagonists, but my concept of their lives extended only to a faintly rock'n'roll version of middle age. They longed for their youth, tried to recapture it: it's a theme in so many of King's novels. But not in Insomnia. In Insomnia, they're older and getting the hell on with it.
This makes me sound like an idiot, I'm sure, but I was 14. I was an idiot. I wasn't interested in senior citizens any more than (shame on me) I was interested in the more intricate feminist notes that King was hitting. At first I didn't care about Ralph, or Lois, his romantic interest and co-lead; but then, suddenly, I did. A large chunk of the book reads like a standalone novel appealing to the new fans King had picked up with his previous couple of novels: people who wanted less in the way of schlock monsters, and more of his insights into humanity.
And then, for me, the book got suddenly interesting. Ralph suffers from the insomnia of the title, and thanks to his lack of sleep, one day he starts to see things. He glimpses strange auras around people that trail off into the sky like strings (or, as he comes to think of them, as lifelines); then he starts to see strange, shrunken men dressed like doctors, creeping around at night wielding huge pairs of scissors. The “little bald doctors” – who are linked to the ancient Greek conception of the Fates – are killing people; cutting their strings. For 14-year-old me, this was the moment when the book suddenly became a horror story, which is what I thought I wanted from King.
Only, wait! The strange bald doctors aren't stock horror villains. They're actually serving to bridge the divide between the concepts of “purpose” and “random” – two key notions in King's Dark Tower series, and a less high-profile constant throughout much of his later work. The theme of free will versus some form of higher predestination runs through a huge amount of King's fiction, coming to a head in the Dark Tower series. In Insomnia it was laid bare, and when I first read it, King sort of lost me. There's a lengthy and important subplot concerning abortions and the pro-choice camp, and the book wanders into total ka-is-a-wheel, heavy-referencing-for-the-fanbase territory. This is also where King introduces the Crimson King, who would later drive much of the action in the final Dark Tower novels. That's when the truth of this book is revealed. It's not a standalone. It's a Dark Tower novel, almost more so than even The Gunslinger.
If you remember my reread of The Gunslinger, I didn't read the Dark Tower series until I was 23. So when I first read Insomnia, all its references to King's other works meant nothing to me. Insomnia worked fine by itself – once I started to accept it for what it is, rather than what I wanted it to be – but it works so, so much better when considered as part of King's wider oeuvre. It's crucial, frankly, to an understanding of some of the deeper themes of the Dark Tower books; and vice versa.
Over the years since I first read it, I've returned to Insomnia almost more than any other King book. (The only one I can say for certain that I've read more times is The Dark Half.) Something about its ruminations on time, higher powers, memories and the inevitability of life affected me. It continues to. It is potentially his single most influential work, for me.
And that must have coloured my feelings towards the text, because now I think it's a masterpiece: an amazing, powerful meditation on free will. By the end of Ralph's journey – and make no mistake, it is a journey, even though he technically doesn't go anywhere; even though he's a character I (wrongly) assumed had no more journeys left in him to make – you're completely embroiled, and desperately hoping that the inevitability which the novel has pretty much guaranteed the whole way through won't come to pass.
But it does. Ralph gets the ending that King promised him, almost on the very first page: he finally gets cured of his sleeping sickness.
Connections
Insomnia is a Dark Tower book, more so than perhaps any other non-main series text. We've got the Crimson King (known here as the Kingfisher); Patrick Danville, who would be hugely important in the final Dark Tower books; and there are massive thematic connections, particularly regarding Purpose and Random, the “grammar” of the Dark Tower. Insomnia is also hugely indebted to It, being set in the same town only eight years later, and refers to the events of that novel. There is a good argument to be made for Insomnia being something of a spiritual sequel: both books feature the same themes, and there are loud echoes of the earlier book. At the start of this reread, I said that the world wanted more Pennywise; in the Kingfisher, we have a creature strongly connected to that original evil, in ways that suggest the two are more than just acquaintances.
Next time: We're taking the bull by the horns and rereading Rose Madder.
Lovin' your errors How a little TLC pays back with interest. Roger Peppe Canonical Ltd Most common phrase in Go? if err != nil { return err } If Go had exceptions func doSomething() { foo() bar() baz() } What we actually write func doSomething() error { if err := foo(); err != nil { return err } if err := bar(); err != nil { return err } if err := baz(); err != nil { return err } return nil } Why is this better? Errors are important!
We spend lots of time looking at errors
A good error message can save days of work
Errors happen all the time Robustness Reasonable behaviour in small programs
... but not in large ones.
Failure is common Explicit makes readable Is this function robust under failure?
With exceptions, I have no idea
In Go: yes! func doSomething() { foo() bar() baz() } Maintainability Principle attributed to Jonathon Blow:
Making small logical changes should not require/result in wildly varying program code
Rather, changes should be as small as possible Panic Go actually does have exceptions
Reserved for truly exceptional situations
Never part of a public interface
Instead, consider each error individually Handle those errors! Panic
Return
Ignore
Log
Gather
Diagnose Panic When an error really should not happen
Broken internal invariants
Initialisation errors // MustCompile is like Compile but panics if the expression cannot be parsed. // It simplifies safe initialization of global variables holding compiled regular // expressions. func MustCompile(str string) *Regexp { regexp, error := Compile(str) if error != nil { panic(`regexp: Compile(` + quote(str) + `): ` + error.Error()) } return regexp } Return Most common option
Maligned but can actually add value (wait and see) if err != nil { return err } Ignore Generally frowned upon
Errors are usually returned for good reason
But sometimes it's OK (bytes.Buffer, log messages)
There's a tool that can can check for you go get github.com/kisielk/errcheck % errcheck ./... agent/agent.go:654:11 buf.Write(data) agent/bootstrap.go:96:12 st.Close() agent/identity.go:29:12 os.Remove(c.SystemIdentityPath()) agent/tools/toolsdir.go:57:16 defer zr.Close() Log When you want to carry on regardless
Usually in high level logic
Need to choose a logging framework. // IncCounterAsync increases by one the counter associated with the composed // key. The action is done in the background using a separate goroutine. func (s *Store) IncCounterAsync(key []string) { s.Go(func(s *Store) { if err := s.IncCounter(key); err != nil { logger.Errorf("cannot increase stats counter for key %v: %v", key, err) } }) } Gather Common in concurrent situations
Could just choose the first one
Or make an error that holds them all
... but that can end up unreadable. // Errors holds any errors encountered during the parallel run. type Errors []error func (errs Errors) Error() string { switch len(errs) { case 0: return "no error" case 1: return errs[0].Error() } return fmt.Sprintf("%s (and %d more)", errs[0].Error(), len(errs)-1) } Diagnose "Identify the nature of a problem by examination of the symptoms"
Actually relatively unusual Diagnosis techniques 1 - special value Define a specific error value.
Classical example: io.EOF
Useful when we don't need any more info
Very cheap var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found") err := environments.Find(bson.D{{"_id", id}}).One(&env) if err == mgo.ErrNotFound { return nil } Diagnosis techniques 2 - special type Define a special error type
Error is just an interface with a single method
Classical example: os.PathError type PathError struct { Op string Path string Err error } func (e *PathError) Error() string { return e.Op + " " + e.Path + ": " + e.Err.Error() } err := os.Create("/tmp/something") if err, ok := err.(*os.PathError); ok { } Diagnosis techniques 3 - interface Extensible to multiple types/values type Error interface { error Timeout() bool // Is the error a timeout? Temporary() bool // Is the error temporary? } if err, ok := err.(net.Error); ok && err.Temporary() { ... } Diagnosis techniques 4 - function predicate Allows arbitrary logic
Classical example: os.IsNotExist func IsNotExist(err error) bool { switch pe := err.(type) { case nil: return false case *PathError: err = pe.Err case *LinkError: err = pe.Err } return err == syscall.ENOENT || err == ErrNotExist } Why so many techniques? Each one has its own trade-offs.
Error is always interpreted in context...
... because it comes from a single source
Properly modular ...
... except when many places just return the error Recap Errors indicate some failure
Influence control flow
Are used in context
Also used to describe errors Annotated error messages Like a backwards stack
Usually added by return statements
Works well with concurrency if err != nil { return "", fmt.Errorf("cannot read random secret: %v", err) } Errors with concurrency for { select { case msg := <-msgChan: err := doSomething(msg.params) msg.reply <- fmt.Errorf("cannot do something: %v", err) ... } } If everyone annotates, we get nice messages Message reads like a story
cannot read random secret because of unexpected EOF "cannot read random secret: unexpected EOF" If no-one annotates, error messages are less useful True story
Click on Login, got reply "EOF"
Error actually traversed 13 stack levels
Could have been cannot get login entity: cannot get user "admin": mongo query failed: cannot acquire socket: cannot log in: error authorizing user "admin": request failed: cannot read reply: EOF But...! Annotation obscures diagnosis
Either return custom value/type
... or hide the diagnosis entirely err := fmt.Errorf("cannot open file: %v", err) if os.IsNotExist(err) { // never reached } An augmented approach gopkg.in/errgo.v1
Cause-preserving annotation
Records source location
Agnostic about actual errors
Can use all the existing techniques Annotation in errgo Similar to fmt.Errorf
Also records source location if err != nil { return errgo.Notef(err, "cannot read random secret") } Diagnosis in errgo Cause function works on any error
Returns underlying cause, ignoring annotations
Default cause is error itself if errgo.Cause(err) == io.UnexpectedEOF { ... } if os.IsNotExist(errgo.Cause(err)) { ... } Cause is masked by default Constrains possible causes
Error causes are part of API
Explicit is much better for maintenance Causes with errgo: simplest case Record the source location
Mask the cause return errgo.Mask(err) Causes with errgo: mask predicates Record source location
Preserve selected causes
Predicate function allows specific causes // Preserve any cause return errgo.Mask(err, errgo.Any) // Preserve only some causes return errgo.Mask(err, os.IsNotExist, os.IsPermission) Causes with errgo: annotate and mask Record source location
Add annotation
Preserve selected causes return errgo.NoteMask(err, "cannot open database file", os.IsNotExist) Causes with errgo: choice of cause Choose another cause
Add annotation if err == mgo.IsNotFound { return errgo.WithCausef(err, params.ErrNotFound, "no such document") } Error printing in errgo: fmt.Printf("%v
", err) cannot encrypt password: cannot read random secret: unexpected EOF fmt.Printf("%#v", err) [{/home/rog/src/github.com/juju/utils/encrypt.go:97: cannot encrypt password} {/home/rog/src/github.com/juju/utils/password.go:32: cannot read random secret} {unexpected EOF}] errgo data structure Conclusion If you pay attention to your errors, you will be rewarded.
Existing practice leaves something to be desired.
It's possible to do better and stay compatible with existing practice. Thank you Roger Peppe Canonical Ltd rogpeppe@gmail.com @rogpeppe

WALPOLE (CBS) – For the second year in a row, The Raven's Nest in Walpole has temporarily changed its name to “The Patriot's Nest.”
The bar is about five miles from Gillette Stadium and the owners want to prove their loyalty to the Patriots.
“Oh my God, New Englanders are crazy,” says owner Mark McAuliffe. “They are like ‘we are not going to go into your bar for a week!”
On Sunday, the Patriots will once again host the Ravens in the AFC Championship. New England won the game last year 23-20.
McAuliffe says the name change last year boosted business.
“We got to let people know that we are a New England pub,” says McAuliffe.
The Mad Raven Pub & Restaurant in Waltham is also owned by McAuliffe. That bar will temporarily be known as “The Mad Patriot.”
Hungary has declared war on it's wealthiest and most generous son: Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. So why is the European Union intervening in Hungary's war against their biggest philanthropist?
IT'S not every day a country declares war on perhaps it's wealthiest and most generous son.
But that's exactly what's happened in the case of famed Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros and his native Hungary — forcing the European Union to intervene.
On Monday, Hungarian leader Viktor Orban welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the country. The visit follows claims Orban had stoked anti-Semitism by printing huge billboards of Soros and plastering them around the country.
While the posters have since been taken down, the visit pits right-wing leaders Orban and Netanyahu against the famous Jewish businessman and philanthropist who fled the Nazis and moved to America.
Here's what you need to know about the country that waged war on a billionaire:
WHO IS GEORGE SOROS?
Now 86, Soros fled the Nazi occupation and moved to London before emigrating to the US where he launched a hedge fund, famously pocketing $1 billion in currency speculation against the Bank of England in 1992.
He's now worth an estimated $31 billion and is one of the largest funders of non-governmental activities and civil society across Hungary through his Open Society Foundations. He has given away $15 billion campaigning for democracy and a range of other issues.
However it's his work with refugees that have made him a target of the Orban government.
Last year, Soros pledged $500 million to support refugees and said Europe should accept “several hundred thousand fully-screened refugees through an orderly process of vetting and resettlement.”
That contrasts with the Orban government who want to ban freedom of movement and have called refugees a “trojan horse” of terrorism and security. They've also made much of claims Soros wants to bring “a million illegal immigrants” to the country, something Soros has dismissed as “fantasy”.
CONTROVERSIAL BILLBOARDS
The standoff led to a $12 million government campaign with the smiling face of the Jewish businessman, warning voters “Let's not let Soros have the last laugh.”
Jewish groups said the poster was anti-Semitic, playing on the “laughing Jew” stereotype and was part of a mentality Soros had fled from as a child. His spokesman said the posters were “reminiscent of Europe's darkest hours”.
They've since been taken down (with plenty removed by activists) but despite the alleged anti-Semitism, Israel has maintained its support for the Hungarian government, saying it did not want to “delegitimize” criticism of Soros.
Meanwhile, the European Union has launched legal action against Hungary over new laws targeting civil society groups that receive money from overseas.
The EU thinks it will restrict them from being able to work, while Hungary said it wants to increase the transparency of such groups.
Hungary has one month to reply to the Commission's arguments and both cases could be eventually referred by the Commission to the EU Court of Justice.
Soros' Open Society Foundation has slammed the decision to target civil society groups as a “serious attack on Hungarian democracy.”
European director Goran Buldioski said the law “undermines the fundamentals” and people are being misled by the government.
Peter Nizak, head of Open Society's work in Hungary said: “We continue to believe in the rule of law and democracy in Hungary and endorse the actions of those NGOs who have said they will challenge its legality; the NGOs that will be particularly hard hit by this discriminatory and unnecessary law have our full solidarity.”

Award-winning Christian author Philip Yancey is dumbfounded by the way that many members of his faith have rallied around Donald Trump.
Yancey expressed his doubts about the Republican presidential candidate and his Christian supporters during an interview with website Evangelical Focus.
“I am staggered that so many conservative or evangelical Christians would see a man who is a bully, who made his money by casinos, who has had several wives and several affairs, that they would somehow paint him as a hero, as someone that we could stand behind,” Yancey said.
“To choose a person who stands against everything that Christianity believes as the hero, the representative, one that we get behind enthusiastically is not something that I understand at all,” he added.
To choose a person who stands against everything that Christianity believes as the hero ... is not something that I understand at all. Philip Yancey
Yancey, a respected author and columnist whose books about Christianity have sold millions of copies, is just the latest evangelical heavyweight to speak out against Trump. A number of high profile evangelical Christians have parked themselves in the “Never Trump” camp, pointing out that the candidate's policies and actions don't reflect Christian values.
And yet, rank and file white evangelical Christians don't seem to mind ― or at least, are willing to forgive. The group, which counts for one-fifth of all registered voters in the U.S. and roughly one-third of all voters with Republican leanings, has been rallying strongly around Trump. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June, 78 percent of white evangelical voters said they would vote for Trump.
Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks on the campus of Liberty University on January 18, 2016. Liberty is a non-profit, private Christian university that was founded in 1971 by evangelical Southern Baptist televangelist Jerry Falwell.
In private meetings with evangelical pastors supportive of his campaign, the nominee promised to cherish and defend America's “Christian heritage,” which has struck a chord with Christians who feel that they are losing the culture wars.
But Yancey believes that tying the church and politics together in this way isn't good for American Christianity in the long run.
“There are countries in Europe where the church is set back for decades and decades, because they have been stained by how they sold their soul for power, I would say.”
Insular artefacts from Viking-Age burials from mid-Norway. A review of contact between Trøndelag and Britain and Ireland Aina Margrethe Heen-Pettersen 0000-0002-3008-7018

Summary
This article presents a detailed overview of the Insular artefacts found in Viking-Age burials from the Trøndelag region of mid-Norway, most of which have not previously been published in English. The archaeological evidence indicates that contact between Trøndelag and the British Isles was well established at an early stage of the Viking Age. The main evidence for contact comes from the 9th century, when a number of significant patterns can be discerned. Some local concentrations of Insular goods show the continuing importance of some pre-Viking centres, while other areas suggest co-operation between several neighbouring families in order to equip and provision overseas expeditions. Later, the datable Insular artefacts indicate significant changes in the nature of contact. North Sea trading towards the end of the Viking Age appears to be affected by increasing centralisation of power in Trøndelag during the 10th century.

SALT LAKE CITY — President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Georgia Rep. Tom Price as the secretary of health and human services sent a strong signal that he intends to follow through on plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
The tea party Republican has been working for years to replace the health care law he once called a "misbegotten monstrosity."
There are several competing plans to replace President Barack Obama's health care law, but Price's draft — at 242 pages — is the most detailed.
Here are some key planks — and how they might affect you.
1. Assistance through tax credits
Much like Obamacare, Price's plan suggests giving out tax credits to help people buy insurance.
How much you get would depend on your age. Price has proposed $100 per month for adults 18 to 35, which would go up to $250 per month for adults 50 and older.
Price has also proposed expanding health savings accounts, which allow people to sock away money before taxes to pay for health care needs.
The idea is to encourage people to budget for predictable medical expenses — like primary care visits — and rely only on insurance only for catastrophes.
That's a common theme among Republican health care proposals, said BYU economics professor Mark Showalter.
“What the Republican plans are likely to do is put more burden on consumers as far as their health care costs,” Showalter said. “Most of them have an almost explicit motive to reduce the use of insurance in paying for medical care.”
By nudging people to pay for more things out of pocket, the hope is that people will do more shopping for the best price.
“That's not a pleasant thing — try to call a doctor and ask how much an MRI's going to cost,” Showalter said. “But the Republican plans all kind of push consumers in that direction — to pay more of the cost of the care and be more price-sensitive.”
2. Slimmer plans, cheaper premiums
“One of the biggest things we often hear about the replacement plans is what we're going to get rid of,” said Jason Stevenson of the Utah Health Policy Project.
Price has proposed getting rid of a major tenet of the Affordable Care Act: The requirement that health plans cover 10 essential benefits, including maternity care and mental health services.
Instead, he would open it back up to insurers to cherry-pick which benefits they want to cover in each plan.
That means insurance offerings will look a lot more like they did before Obamacare, when insurers could raise the price for certain individuals based on their gender, age or health status.
Showalter said that will likely make insurance more efficient and cheaper.
But Stevenson said it will come at a cost.
“If you're perfectly healthy and you never have any issues and you're young, then this could benefit you,” he said. “Your rates might come down a little bit."
People who are older, lower-income or need more comprehensive plans, however, may see those prices go up, he said.
3. No mandate — but people with pre-existing conditions will be exposed
One of the most popular aspects of Obamacare was the provision that prevents insurers from charging a patient more if she or he has a pre-existing condition.
Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan have both said they want to keep that provision — but with conditions.
Price's plan would require patients to maintain coverage for at least 18 months. If you lapse, you can be charged up to 150 percent of the standard rate for two years for your pre-existing condition.
Showalter and Stevenson both said they are skeptical that Republicans can continue to protect people with pre-existing conditions unless they mandate that people get insurance.
“There's no way around this,” Showalter said.
Insurance works when there are enough healthy people in the mix to balance out the sick, he said. If nobody is required to get insurance, only the sickest people will sign up, which will drive costs up.
“You cannot ban pre-existing condition discrimination without some sort of stick to get healthy people to enter the insurance market,” Stevenson said. “It just doesn't work.”
4. High risk pools are back
Price and Ryan have both proposed bringing back government-run high risk pools as a safety valve for these folks.
How well these work will vary from state by state.
Tomi Ossana, the former director of Utah's high risk pool, said the program was a necessary but costly safety net.
The state shelled out $2 million to $16 million a year to subsidize costs in the pool. Patients in the pool paid an average of $300 to $400 a month in premiums. Those who couldn't afford the premiums went uninsured and relied on charity care to get by. Many ended up in the Medicaid coverage gap after the pool was shut down, Ossana said.
The program was also amassing larger and larger deficits each year by the time it closed due to rising demand and medical costs.
Ryan has proposed spending $2.5 billion per year to fund high risk pools. Price has proposed about $1 billion per year.
If the pools were to be brought back, Ossana said they would need a more stable funding mechanism and more funding to help people with premiums.
“It protected those individuals that really were denied in the private market, but it was costly,” she said.
5. No more tax breaks for employers
Experts estimate the government loses around $250 billion a year by not taxing health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored plans.
Price has proposed capping how many companies can deduct in taxes from employee insurance.
Economists love the idea. Corporations and unions hate it. The Affordable Care Act also passed a version of this known as the "Cadillac tax,” which was vigorously opposed.
Showalter said employers will likely react by shifting some of the cost onto their employees. That means cutting benefits or switching to high deductible plans.
"That will affect a lot of people," he said. "Economists are all over it. But it's tremendously unpopular."
What's the bottom line?
As with any policy change, there will be trade-offs.
Showalter says the Republican plan is likely to bring premiums down overall by allowing insurers to craft narrower plans and moving sicker people to a different pool.
But there will be a trade-off in the “social justice sense,” he said. Certain people will benefit, while others will have to pay more.
"If they're a sicker household, they're going to face a higher cost," Showalter said, including many of those who gained insurance through Medicaid expansion.
Women could also find themselves paying more, as they did before the Affordable Care Act. Requirements that insurers cover maternity care and contraception will likely be challenged under Price.
Stevenson said he is pessimistic that the Republican proposals will bring down prices unless they can figure out how to pay for the provision that protects people with pre-existing conditions.
“It's the sick, the vulnerable, the lower-income that are going to be really hurt by these changes to the system," Stevenson said.
What is the likelihood of this happening?
The Affordable Care Act is a massive and complex piece of legislation.
Republicans can dismantle some parts of it through a process known as budget reconciliation. With a simple majority vote, they could get rid of the tax credits, the individual mandate and gut Medicaid expansion.
But they cannot change some of the most popular provisions of the law without a two-thirds majority. That includes the ban on pre-existing condition exclusions and the requirement that insurers cover young adults on their parents' policies.
Opponents of the law will also have to keep in mind that some 20 million people gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. By repealing the law without a backup, millions could lose coverage.
So that means for a full repeal and replace, Republicans will need a plan — and the cooperation of Democrats.
CHESTER, Pa. – Oscar Pareja understands the optics don't look good.
For a team coming off the 2016 Supporters' Shield and now challenging for the top seed in the Western Conference in '17, losing back-to-back games by a combined score of 7-1 does seem rather jarring.
But the FC Dallas head coach insists that the last two contests are more of a blip than a major cause for concern.
“We have two results that doesn't make it look like a team that's fighting for first in the conference,” Pareja admitted following FCD's 3-1 loss to the Philadelphia Union on Saturday. “We accept it. We're not a team that was looking that good defensively. We will make the corrections. This club has the talent and we have the players to turn things around.
“This is a tough moment we will swallow and overcome with the character that has been a part of this team.”
From the start, it was clear that Saturday probably wouldn't be FC Dallas' night. Fresh off a humbling 4-0 home loss to Vancouver Whitecaps FC last week, the Hoops allowed two goals in the first 22 minutes, with Union head coach Jim Curtin later calling it the team's best half of the season.
That it came against a Dallas defense that had allowed fewer goals than all but three teams in MLS was a big reason for Curtin's lofty praise. It was also surprising to Pareja, who thought his team should have been able to overcome their disappointing first half and still earn a result.
“It's a game that you may think that you will win with options to score and you're not clinical and the other team finds a way to hurt you,” the Dallas coach said. “And that shows that we're not defending well. We take the responsibility starting with me. I'm disappointed that we're conceding goals that easy, but at the same time, I have to say that the boys put a lot of volume on the other side of the field and they couldn't score. In the second half, I thought we dominated.”
Indeed, if not for a career-high nine saves from Union goalkeeper John McCarthy, who was filling in for the injured Andre Blake, Saturday's result could have been different.
But the Hoops didn't use that as an excuse, nor the fact that they were without the suspended Carlos Gruezo while still working key players back into the lineup following Gold Cup absences.
“Our team is ready,” midfielder Victor Ulloa said. “The guys that are here and are available to have been doing a great job. I think that we have been working well since preseason and we have the depth that we always like to talk about.”
So what can they do to recover from the last two lopsided losses and stop their summer swoon?
“I think we need to stick to our fundamentals,” Ulloa said. “We always preach about keeping the zero and the shutout, and that we can score at any moment. Also, I think we are missing the final touch in the last third. We created chances, but unfortunately we dug ourselves deep with two goals in the first half and it is hard to come back from that."
Hello Everyone! Runes Reforged will be on live in a handful of days! We wanted to do one last communication piece for you all about how Runes Reforged has changed pregame decision making, and how you can expect to change up your runes before a game of League of Legends. Quick run down of how Runes Reforged changes pregame power and decision making: * There are fewer runes in the new system, but their power is concentrated far more than we saw in previous Runes or Masteries. * Runes are now free, and can now be changed in champ select * Players that reactively select certain runes stand to gain substantial power over generic, less optimized builds This last point is one that we haven't talked about directly too much, though it's a core element of the design. In order to ensure that most champions get to make decisions in most of their games, we've spread the types of decision between options that focus on your own champion and options that care about your allies and opponents. Let's go through some examples: Resolve features one slot that asks what defenses you need in the early game, or gives you the greedy option to beef up later, at the cost of nothing in the laning phase. This decision very directly asks who are your lane opponent, and how much of a threat they bring to you. Gathering Storm offer's a similar question. Few runes offer as much power in the late game, but it offers much less if your game ends at twenty or twenty-five minutes. You might choose this on a Veigar or Karthus to live the late game dream, but you might also pick this in a lane where you don't think early aggression will be fruitful. A few reactions can be very particular. Perfect Timing is a great example of this. Against a Zed or Kayn, or other champions with highly telegraphed damage, this rune can safe your life, and put you up in the race to get a vital legendary item. However, in case where you don't need the stasis, you have a filled inventory slot and full slot's worth of opportunity cost. As an aside, we know this sort of decision making takes time. We've added time in champion select and will be watching the various queues to make sure each mode has enough time to avoid feeling rushed, especially for the later picks. With runes having a lot more situational power, it's likely that guides and experts will need to adapt to a world where pregame choices don't have simple “right” answers. We still expect that players will get a lot of benefit from using guides as a starting point, but more than ever, reactive decision making will be very powerful. This means that guides might have to give extra context on some suggestions, accept a level of inaccurate recommendations, or show a wider array of possibilities. We've worked with a number of the guide sites to give them info right away when the system launches, and give them a heads-up about the more contextual nature of the system. Finally, I wanted to reiterate one last time that this really is just the beginning for us. We've done our best to get the system balanced for launch, but a change this big is going to have some bug, and some power imbalances that we just couldn't find or fix fast enough for release. We also ran out of time for some features we're really excited about, like how we show runes in end of game, or providing a really high polish option for runes selection out of champion select. We're also aware that some particular champions have fewer options in the new system. Some champions will never have a multitude of options, but we do want champions to have at least a single Keystone and path that feel suited to their needs. Lastly, we've also only got the first attempts in for feedback stats for runes. You'll be able to see these in your match history, and eventually we'll get these in end of game. If there are stats you'd find valuable to understand the performance of a particular rune choice, we're invested in build the tools for players to understand their choices and evolve their approach to the game. Thanks everyone! See you on the rift!

500 Startups wants to help corporations understand how to work with startups. In collaboration with Pilot44, the firm has created a four-day course for executives called “Corporate Startup Innovation Unlocked,” from July 11 to 14. Attendees will hear from entrepreneurs and others about how to direct their innovation efforts in order to stay relevant in the current business climate.
“Corporate startup innovation isn't new, but more and more corporations around the world aren't able to realize how to tap into the startup ecosystem,” Zafer Younis, a partner at 500 Startups, told VentureBeat in an interview. “They've tried before for a while, but with more disruption from startups, they're seeing this become a higher priority.”
Although 500 Startups receives visitation requests from Fortune 500 companies — from representatives wanting to connect with the portfolio companies — very little follow-up takes place. “Most of the discussions fail and waste a lot of time on both ends,” Younis explained. He and the rest of the firm's team want to bridge this gap, thereby making it easier for collaboration (and perhaps acquisition) to take place.
“Corporate Startup Innovation Unlocked” is designed as a seminar for up to 30 people and is geared towards providing direction to anyone looking to “find the right startups and engage with them in a meaningful and accelerated way.” 500 Startups doesn't have an ideal attendee in mind — it could be a vice president of innovation, chief innovation officer, partners at consulting firms, or anybody else — no one is too junior or too senior.
Each day will feature 2 to 3 hours of theory and framework, provided by the folks at Pilot44. Afterwards, speakers from around the industry will be brought in to look at case studies and share both the good and bad experiences they've had working with corporations or startups. Some of the speakers include P&G, Nestle, Cox Automotive, Google, and Microsoft. Younis said there's an optional fifth day of the program during which representatives from startups and corporations will come together at a mixer and will also be able to participate in one-on-one meetings to discuss specific pain points and challenges.
Corporations who are interested in participating should plan on solving these three pieces of the puzzle: What's the corporate business challenge that's trying to be solved by working with a startup? Can you identify the startups that are working in your specific industry or can help overcome your challenge? How do you establish partnerships, measure them, and report back to your superiors about how the startup has helped you?
Silicon Valley is home to many companies that have set up shop, eager to tap into the innovation revolution taking place. Samsung, Target, Orange, Wells Fargo, and others all have a presence doing either research and development or simply looking to work with startups. But many others that don't have the resources on the ground also look to this area, and 500 Startups wants to be a centralized resource for them.

Traditionally, corporations have reached out to venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, or Norwest Venture Partners to find interesting startups. But 500 Startups believes it can offer more options, thanks to its portfolio of more than 1,000 startups. According to managing partner Dave McClure, while this program is aimed at helping make acquisitions happen, it's also about giving corporations a view of what it's like to work with startups. “We're trying to match up dollars and product with speed to market,” he shared with us.
In addition, he said that 500 Startups is able to exploit an “untapped opportunity with matching small companies with big companies,” and he added, “we're in a good position to make it happen.”
The first session will take place in San Francisco, and Younis hasn't decided yet whether to expand it to other parts of the world (as 500 Startups has done with its Distro Dojo program). He said that it'll depend on where the most interest and attendee applications are coming from: “If we see a large number of applications come from a specific geography, we may consider it.”
While the ulterior motive for 500 Startups may be financial — to encourage acquisition of its portfolio companies — it also wants to help corporations develop skills that they can use to identify and engage with startups to benefit their own company.
Applications for “Corporate Startup Innovation Unlocked” are being accepted now. The cost is $6,500 for the early bird tickets and $11,750 for the regular seats.
Updated as of 10:24 a.m. Pacific: This post has been updated to reflect a drop in early bird pricing.
Oklahoma Approves Nitrogen Asphyxiation For Executions
Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a law today allowing nitrogen to be used in executions in the state in case lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or the drugs are not available.
Oklahoma is the first state to approve such a method. It would involve placing a mask over an inmate's face and supplying pure nitrogen instead of air. The condemned person slowly asphyxiates from lack of oxygen. Besides lethal injection, other methods currently approved for use in other states are electrocution, gas chamber, hanging and firing squad.
"Nitrogen-induced hypoxia is a painless form of execution that doesn't require any specific pharmaceutical compounds or any medical expertise to administer," Rep. Mike Christian, R-Oklahoma City, the House sponsor of the legislation, was quoted by The Tulsa World as saying. "It is a far better alternative to the electric chair should lethal injection ever become unavailable, and so I thank the governor for signing this bill into law."
Many states have experienced shortages of lethal injection drugs because manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have refused to supply them.
A study commissioned by Oklahoma and published last month concluded that "an execution protocol that induced hypoxia via nitrogen inhalation would be a humane method to carry out a death sentence."
A year ago, Oklahoma carried out a botched execution of death row inmate Clayton D. Lockett, who was given the sedative midazolam due to a shortage of the drug normally used, sodium thiopental. Lockett took 45 minutes to die as he writhed in pain on the execution gurney.
The Atlantic noted in an article published last month: "This isn't Oklahoma's first time engineering new execution methods. The modern lethal-injection protocol was first proposed by an Oklahoma state medical examiner named Jay Chapman in 1977."
In March, Utah also brought back the firing squad.
Minnesota United FC opens the NASL season tomorrow, with a game in San Antonio. Their home opener is April 26, against Edmonton. Here now, a look at the team, as they attempt to improve from a disappointing 2013.
THREE STORYLINES
1. Veterans and Brazilians
United moved for experience and age in the off-season. Central defender Tiago Calvano, midfielder Juliano Vicentini, and attacking midfielder Daniel Mendes will all be 33 this season - and all are Brazilians, thanks in part to the scouting and acquisition work of the team's incumbent Brazilian connection, Pablo Campos and Cristiano Dias. The team also brought in winger Jamie Watson, who is 28 but entering his tenth year in American pro soccer, as yet another veteran to support the team's title chase.
It's a calculated move on Minnesota's part, designed to reduce the time it will take for the team to gel. The NASL season is split into two absurdly unequal "halves" this year, and the spring season is just nine games long. If United can come together quickly and open the season with a good run, they could clinch a playoff berth early.
2. Win now
Last season was a whirlwind for the team's ownership and front-office staff. Dr. Bill McGuire purchased the team early in the spring, and the remainder of the year was a blitz of new names, new management, and new players. Given the change, it's perhaps less than surprising that the result on the field was inconsistent - and ultimately, a failure.
This season, the group in the management suite has a year under its belt, and is expecting much better things. Head coach Manny Lagos is no doubt feeling the pressure; he's one of just four NASL coaches still in place from Opening Day 2013. Another year of mid-table mediocrity will likely lead to changes.
3. Stadiums and MLS
United would prefer to focus on the product that's on the field in Blaine, but hanging over everything is the ongoing discussion of the team's future. No one sees the National Sports Center as the team's long-term home, but any new stadium developments will be difficult in a Twin Cities market that is suffering from serious stadium fatigue. Tied up in the stadium question, though, are the rumors of a future in Major League Soccer; while Minnesota is considered the frontrunner for a franchise, will it be McGuire and United who make the leap, or will it be a Vikings-led group?
While the rumors are exciting for local soccer fans, they place United in the challenging situation of marketing to a fanbase that may be waiting for the big leagues to come to town. A stadium announcement, or an MLS franchise announcement, would clear up the uncertainty - but neither is anywhere near forthcoming.
PLAYER TO WATCH - MIGUEL IBARRA
Last season was the first NASL split season, a split which helped throw Ibarra's Jekyll-and-Hyde year into sharp relief. Awful in the first half, Ibarra recovered enough in the second to be named to the NASL Best XI for the entire year.
His development could be the key to a United attack that, on paper, is less than potent. A likely-season-ending knee injury for Campos means that Minnesota goes into the season without any idea where the offense will come from; first-choice striker Christian Ramirez is untested at this level, and Mendes has yet to prove that he can be the attacking spark that the team needs.
Always quick, Ibarra has yet to find the touch to be either a consistent goal-scorer or a consistent provider. His move back to the wing in the second half of 2013 helped; now he has to prove that he can consistently create opportunities, as well as finishing his own.
POSITION-BY-POSITION
Goalkeeper
Matt Van Oekel returns as the incumbent between the pipes. The 27-year-old lost his starting job for the first six games of 2013, but came back strong and started the remainder of the season, except for the final two games, when he was injured. Mitch Hildebrandt has moved up to the #2 role, and may even push for the starting job; the two split time in the preseason, and either could conceivably start on Saturday.
Center back
Aaron Pitchkolan made last year's league Best XI at center back, but for the moment, it looks like the Brazilian duo of Dias and Calvano will start in the middle of defense, with Pitchkolan moving to a role as a defensive midfielder. Dias played several games out of position at fullback last year, but is more at home in the center, while Calvano has slotted in there from the beginning of preseason. Pitchkolan probably remains the first backup in the center, with Brent Kallman returning as a reserve as well.
Fullback
On the left, Justin Davis appears set to resume being one of the first names into the starting lineup for every game. Davis struggled early last year, but came back strong, and has been an automatic choice throughout. On the right, Kevin Venegas started every game of the preseason, completing his transformation from wide midfielder to right back. Venegas played most of the second half of last year, supplanting veteran Brian Kallman, who doesn't have the speed that Venegas has. Kallman will back up on the right, while new signing Tyler Polak - younger brother of striker Nate Polak - provides depth on the left.
Defensive midfield
If he isn't playing center back, Pitchkolan is a virtual lock to play defensively in midfield. The rest of the options are up in the air; Juliano Vicentini may start there, simply to see what he can do as a new signing, but Kentaro Takada and Michael Reed both saw significant minutes in a defensive-minded role last year as well. The wonderfully-named Mozzi Gyorio could also see time.
Attacking midfield
Watson and Ibarra are likely to begin the season on the wing, though Simone Bracelello - who scored seven goals last year from out wide - and Omar Daley are also likely to push for places.
The real question may come from the center of the midfield, where United is still without someone who can take over as a playmaking midfielder. Floyd Franks is a possibility, though he was out of favor during the preseason; Takada, whose best skill is the ability to sprint for 90 straight minutes, may be tried there as well. Mendes is being promoted as a striker by the team, but was listed as a midfielder everywhere else he played; he may end up playing more as an attacking midfielder. The team could also move Watson or Ibarra to the center, and stick with Daley or Bracalello on the wing.
Forward
The weight of Campos's injury falls squarely on Ramirez, who is thrust into a role as the team's #1 striker. Ramirez showed flashes of talent during the preseason, but he's yet to prove himself at this high of a level during his career. Backing up is Polak, who joined the team late in 2012 but missed most of 2013 with an injury. Should neither prove effective, United will be reduced to playing various midfielders as strikers, probably starting with Mendes and going down the list from there.
LEAGUE STORYLINES
1. Big Four and Little Six?
In the old days of the Big Ten, wags used to refer to the conference as the Big Two and Little Eight, with Michigan and Ohio State dominating the conference. The NASL seems to be splitting along similar lines, with four big-spending teams - New York, Tampa Bay, San Antonio, and Minnesota - distancing themselves from the other six in terms of dollars spent. That said, with the exception of the league-favorite-son Cosmos, money can't always buy titles. Minnesota spent plenty last year, and it didn't help them at all.
2. Still wobbly
Second-division soccer in the United States has always been a transient thing, and the NASL is no different. Ottawa and Indy join this year, bringing the league up to ten teams, and (for once) all eight teams from last season return this year - a modicum of stability for a league that's seen very little.
Even so, worries remain. Virginia was supposed to begin play this year, but is pushed back at least until 2015, thanks to a combination of ownership and stadium concerns. Oklahoma City, too, was supposed to start next season, but at the moment seems to be bereft of ownership or direction.
The league office isn't exactly rock-solid, either. The league changed its playoff format for the season barely six weeks before the opening kick, adding a layer of confusion to the playoff picture. The winners of each half of the season, plus the two teams with the best record throughout 2014, will make the playoffs - this despite the second "half" being twice as long as the first "half" of the season. Why have halves at all?
3. Three Predictions
Lock: The Cosmos will continue to be the darling of the league. The NASL clearly sees the Cosmos as the best way to promote itself, given the history associated with the Cosmos name - to the point that some have begun calling it the “North American Cosmos League.”
Guess: Indy Eleven, led by indefatigable fan-pleasing president/GM Peter Wilt, will lead the league in attendance this season. More than any other market, the expansion Indianapolis team seems to have embraced being in the second division, and that - combined with Wilt's usual magic in selling soccer - have led to an enormous amoung of excitement among Indianapolis fans.
Wild Guess: Tampa Bay, led by the acquisition of 2013 Golden Boot winner Brian Shriver, will take the league championship.

Correction:
An electric car company backed by more than a half-billion dollar in Department of Energy loan guarantees has missed early manufacturing goals and has gradually pushed back plans for U.S. production and the creation of thousands of jobs.
This week, Fisker delayed until 2013 the production of the moderately priced family car it plans to build in Delaware. It also learned that its Finnish-produced luxury model, the $96,000 Karma, which is two years late in reaching U.S. markets, failed to meet a promised energy-efficiency standard.
With the demise of Solyndra, a solar company that also won a half-billion-dollar loan from a program to spur clean-energy technologies, the Energy Department's loan guarantees have come under intense scrutiny, and the Obama administration has been under fire for making risky loans to unproven ventures. The administration has stood behind the lending, some of it funded by stimulus, saying that risk is inherent in backing emerging technologies.
Fisker was among the big winners in the administration's effort for broader development of electric vehicles, and company officials said their problems bear no resemblance to those of Solyndra, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September.
“Without any excuses, yes, we did have some delays,” company co-founder Henrik Fisker said during a stop in the District this week to show off his company's sleek new Karma. “But this is completely different. You can't compare at all.”
The Energy Department confirmed this week that it has eased expectations after conditionally approving the loan to Fisker and has made allowances for scaling back projections in the final loan agreement. But the agency declined to make public those adjusted terms, including projected car sales volume or milestones the company must meet in connection with its $529 million loan. Agency officials attributed Fisker's delays to regulatory hurdles and issues beyond the company's control.
Henrik Fisker said in an interview Wednesday that, as of this week, the Karma had been cleared for sale in the United States. Forty have arrived from Finland to be delivered to dealers, and four identical silver versions of the low-slung sedan were parked outside the District's Mandarin Oriental hotel.
“Next year we will reach the 12,000 or 15,000 vehicles we predicted,” Fisker said. “We are really past the start-up risks. That means the skeptics who said we would never produce a car were wrong.”
Energy Secretary Steven Chu was ebullient in September 2009 when he announced the Obama administration's conditional backing for the California-based start-up.
“This investment will create thousands of new American jobs and is another critical step in making sure we are positioned to compete for the clean-energy jobs of the future,” Chu said in a statement at the time. He and President Obama had used similar language when heralding the future of Solyndra.
The Fisker commitment was questioned by some from the start, partly because of the company's political connections. A key investor is a venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, whose partners include former Democratic vice president Al Gore. The investment house raised $2 million for Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
Fisker's deal also generated controversy when the company announced that it planned to build its luxury model in Finland because it could not line up a U.S. contract manufacturer. The Energy Department, reacting this week to an ABC News report on Fisker's Finnish operation, stressed that loan proceeds are going exclusively to U.S. suppliers, not to the Finnish manufacturer.
As a condition for receiving the federal help, Fisker had agreed to build its less-expensive family sedan in the United States. But the company was near the end of the loan approval process before it scrambled to find a manufacturing plant, according to internal e-mails first obtained by Judicial Watch. The White House helped the company quickly locate one in Delaware, Vice President Biden's home state. Biden announced the decision during an October 2009 news conference in Wilmington.
Energy Department officials said Fisker's loan included $169 million to support engineering work for the Karma that was done in the United States, mainly at Fisker's headquarters, which has 700 employees.
Another $359 million loan segment supports production of the Fisker Nina, which will be built at a former General Motors plant. Fisker has 100 workers at the Delaware site and says it plans to employ 2,500. Roger Ormisher, a Fisker spokesman, said Friday that the company originally projected to start full production of the Nina in late 2012 but alerted the Energy Department during its final loan negotiations that production would more likely begin in mid-2013.
“Each of these projects, like the loan program itself, has received strong bipartisan support,” Energy Department spokesman Dan Leistikow said in a statement. “More importantly, both were approved on the merits after extensive review by the Department's loan program office. They represent exactly the type of cutting edge, innovative manufacturing this program was intended to support.”
In applying for the federal help, the company promised it would produce and sell at least 11,000 Karmas by the end of last month. Energy Department staff members declined to comment on changes between the conditional agreement and the final loan but said that number of cars is no longer required.
Obama once pointed to Fisker and other entrepreneurial ventures as part of his campaign to put a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. The Energy Department's loans to Fisker and its chief competitor, Tesla Motors, totaled $1 billion.
This week, Fisker learned its product couldn't deliver on its efficiency pledge — the car cannot travel solely on electricity for a 50-mile stretch. That adds to the many hurdles standing between the company and profitability.
Experts said there is little room for error if Fisker hopes to repay its $529 million loan.
“There is a tremendous amount of risk associated with all of these electric vehicle companies,” said Kevin C. See, an auto industry analyst with Lux Research in Boston. “There is a very real possibility that a lot of these players in the electric vehicle industry may not be there when this all shakes out.”
The company's co-founder waves away such concerns.
“Analysts said two years ago that it couldn't be done,” Fisker said, accelerating as he navigated a Karma through downtown traffic. “Well, here is the car!
“We've raised $600 million in private equity,” he said. “You have to ask, why would they invest if they didn't think we had a good product?”
The prospect of federal backing helped encourage private investment in Fisker. It previously reported raising $25 million, with Kleiner Perkins as a key investor. But in September 2009, the same month the federal loan guarantee was announced, it raised $65 million more, led by an investment arm of the wealthy Middle Eastern nation of Qatar and joined by Kleiner Perkins and Palo Alto Investors.
Fisker said he's not worried about trying to sell his luxury model while the U.S. economy struggles. He said the car's looks, energy efficiency and luxe features — some say it resembles a Maserati — could justify a much higher price.
“We see so much interest. We're very confident,” Fisker said of the pricing, adding that he won't sell the cars at discount. “How often do you go into a Louis Vuitton store and see the prices lowered?”
Update: Reinhart and Rogoff have responded.
So this is huge. Or, rather, it won't matter even a tiny little bit but it ought to be a big deal anyway. You've probably heard that countries with a high debt:GDP ratio suffer from slow economic growth. The specific number 90 percent has been invoked frequently. That's all thanks to a study conducted by Carmen Reinhardt and Kenneth Rogoff for their book This Time It's Different. But the results have been difficult for other researchers to replicate. Now three scholars at the University of Massachusetts have done so in “Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff” and they find that the Reinhart/Rogoff result is based on opportunistic exclusion of Commonwealth data in the late-1940s, a debatable premise about how to weight the data, and most of all a sloppy Excel coding error.
Read Mike Konczal for the whole rundown, but I'll just focus on the spreadsheet part. At one point they set cell L51 equal to AVERAGE(L30:L44) when the correct procedure was AVERAGE(L30:L49). By typing wrong, they accidentally left Denmark, Canada, Belgium, Austria, and Australia out of the average. When you fix the Excel error, a -0.1 percent growth rate turns into 0.2 percent growth.*
This is literally the most influential article cited in public and policy debates about the importance of debt stabilization, so naturally this is going to change everything.
Or, rather, it will change nothing. As I've said many times, citations of the Reinhart/Rogoff result in a policy context obviously appealing to a fallacious form of causal inference. There is an overwhelming theoretical argument that slow real growth will lead to a high debt:GDP ratio and thus whether or not you can construct a dataset showing a correlation between the two tells us absolutely nothing about whether high debt loads lead to small growth. The correct causal inference doesn't rule out causation in the direction Reinhart and Rogoff believe in, but the kind of empirical study they've conducted couldn't possibly establish it. To give an example from another domain, you might genuinely wonder if short kids are more likely to end up malnourished because they're not good at fighting for food or something. A study where you conclude that short stature and malnourishment are correlated would give us zero information about this hypothesis, since everyone already knows that malnourishment leads to stunted growth. There might be causation in the other direction as well, but a correlation study wouldn't tell you.
The fact that Reinhart/Rogoff was widely cited despite its huge obvious theoretical problems leads me to confidently predict that the existence of equally huge, albeit more subtle, empirical problems won't change anything either. As of 2007 there was a widespread belief among elites in the United States and Europe that reductions in retirement benefits were desirable, and subsequent events regarding economic crisis and debt have simply been subsumed into that longstanding view.
*Correction, April 16, 2013: This post originally conflated the impact of the Excel error with the two other objections raised by the University of Massachusetts researchers.
THE FOURTEEN MIGRANTS who were found in the back of a lorry that arrived in Rosslare are to be given legal aid to consider whether they can apply for asylum here.
Yesterday, 12 men and two women were found in the back of a lorry that arrived off a ferry in Rosslare Port. They were contained in a refrigerator trailer but are believed to be in good health.
The CEO of the Immigrant Council of Ireland Brian Killoran told Morning Ireland today that the information was scarce, but they could be eligible to apply for asylum here if they haven't been registered in another EU country.
The 14 people are believed to be of Iranian, Afghani or Kurdish backgrounds, he said, and there was one child travelling with their parents.
What happens now?
“It is their right to seek protection of the state,” Killoran said. “They will be assigned a legal representative and look at their individual circumstances so generally it's based on what their background is.
So if they've applied for asylum in another European country it can be the case that they are returned to that European country. If they haven't been registered anywhere else it could be the case that they can register here in Ireland.
“Hopefully that will be the case that they can apply here in Ireland, that they don't have to go through any further ordeal to be returned again, to Greece or to Italy for example.
We're dealing with people who've come all the way from Afghanistan, all that distance: they've faced a tremendous ordeal to get as far as they have.
He says that this incident was just one example of the “lack of a European response” to the migrant crisis that hasn't relented in severity.
Ireland has accepted less than a quarter of the 4,000 refugees it committed to resettling under international relocation programmes since 2015.
Over the weekend Ireland accepted six teenagers who lived in the dismantled Calais Jungle in France.
Portland officially joined a growing movement Wednesday by formally recognizing the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples' Day.
The City Council voted unanimously to approve the resolution. The second Monday in October is historically celebrated as Columbus Day, a federal holiday. But as of next Monday, Portland will celebrate the people who called the state home for centuries.
"I'm just really overwhelmed by this first step," said Se-Ah-Dom Edmo, a Native American and Portland Human Rights commissioner whose family is from Celilo Village in the Columbia River Gorge.
Advocates of Native Americans have pushed the movement for nearly four decades.
President Franklin Roosevelt first recognized Columbus Day in 1937, and Richard Nixon made it a holiday in 1972. In 2010, the United Nations acknowledged the suffering and lost land and resources of Native people, according to a city statement.
Mayor Charlie Hales said Wednesday that Portlanders have a responsibility to "remember and to learn" about the region's history. "We can remember, we can repair, and we can respect," Hales said.
People lead a procession of tribal members before the kickoff for the newly opened Tilikum Crossing, a unique bridge, in Portland, Ore., Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015. The bridge is one that highlights green traits the city is known for: it's bike friendliness, light-rail and appeal to folks who like to walk. Buses will be allowed but not private cars.

Berkeley, California, was the first major U.S. to abandon Columbus Day, in 1992. Seattle and Minneapolis adopted similar resolutions in 2014.
In an email, Hales' spokeswoman Sara Hottman said city employees don't have the holiday off.
Portland has the ninth largest urban Native American population.
Reyn Leno, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde, said the community is elated.
He told the City Council that indigenous people took great honor in the naming of the Tilikum Bridge, and enjoyed last month's opening ceremony.
But Leno said more could be done. "You can't erase history and culture with a piece of paper and pencil," he said. "But you can do things like this."

New Facebook Scam: Malicious Chrome Extension Spreads Video of Jessica Alba
Facebook has long been a target for all kinds of scammers. The social network has often been leveraged in malware distribution campaigns. Cyren researchers just discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that is spreading nude celebrity PDFs to Facebook groups. Apparently a user is uploading a PDF document to groups with the following name:
Jessice_Alba_Leaked-sextapeVide_oSun_Dec_4_2016_22_99.mp4.pdf
In fact this trick is one of the oldest phishing tricks, but there are still users who fall for the scam.
What Happens If Users Fall for the Scam?
Researchers say that opening the PDF leads to a nude picture with a ”Play“ button in the middle. If clicked, the picture opens up a Web browser for the video to be viewed. If the browser is Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari, the potential victim will be taken to an aggressive advertising page that may contain nudity, fake lottery, etc:
If the user is running Google Chrome, the following link will be opened:
hxxps://rb-xxxxxx.xxx/gxxxxo.php
They will also be shown a fake YouTube website. Clicking the Play button will only open a pop-up window that invites the user to install the bad Google Chrome extension. Once the extension is installed, the browser will open a Facebook.com login page. The extension can read the user's friend list, Facebook groups, and available personal information. It could also upload the PDF to groups, posts and to friends in private chat, researchers say.
The extension is able to read the user's friend list, Facebook groups, plus all personal information and upload the PDF to groups, posts, and to friends in private chat.
Furthermore, the extension contains a list of antivirus and antispam domains to block. It will also prevent users from accessing the Chrome extensions settings page.
What Celebrity Names Are Used in the Scam?
Not surprisingly, the names of beautiful female celebrities were users: Jessica Alba, Jennifer Lawrence, Selena Gomez, Hilary Duff, Rihanna, Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian, Kelly Brook, Doutzen Kroes and Nicki Minaj.
The only way to remove the extension is via deleting its registry key from the reg editor, as well as its folder in AppData.

The Trump administration's 2018 budget plan sent to Congress this week calls for major cuts to funding for medical and science research, and that has research universities — including the University of Wisconsin-Madison — defending the work of scientists.
Sixty public and private research universities, including UW-Madison, endorsed a statement last month calling for continued funding of basic science research at public and private institutions. The Association of American Universities is urging the federal government to continue its decades-long commitment to funding research in the United States.
UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said while federal research funding has increased over the decades, the return on that investment can be seen all around — from the phones in people's pockets to the treatment protocols for cancer and heart disease.
"Here's the problem: When you're funding basic science, you don't know 20 years from now what will be useful and what won't be. Basic science is about trying to explain the world," said Blank, who wrote an op-ed about this issue.
"If I'm going to fund someone doing interesting work on the human body today, I cannot guarantee this will result in a reduction in cancers 20 years from now. What I can tell you is that in the past that type of investment has repaid itself."
The administration seeks to cut the overall National Institutes of Health budget from $31.8 billion to $26 billion.
According to the NIH, it uses more than 80 percent of its budget on grant money to fund research at universities and other scientific centers. That means thousands of institutions would suffer from these proposed cuts.
Lawmakers seemed to ignore the Trump administration's cuts to scientific research when Congress put together a spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year, which runs through September. In it, the NIH received a $2 billion increase.
But Blank is concerned that without a sound commitment that government-funded research will continue, there could be trouble ahead for scientists who toil in labs across the country if portions of the Trump plan becomes a reality.
She said private companies and big pharmaceutical companies won't fill the funding gap because they focus on applied research that will pay dividends in the near term.
"There are all sorts of ideas — some work and some don't — and industry tends to be focused on funding something that we think we can apply in the next three to five years. Basic research is rarely that immediately applicable," Blank said. "Basic science research has enormous long-term gains, but the results tend to be very generalizable. It's not clear who is going to take advantage of it or what industry will most benefit. As a result, no one company is going to pay that bill."
The House Science Committee was scheduled to hold a hearing Wednesday morning titled "Examining the Overhead Cost of Research" that will look at how the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies negotiate the indirect funding that agencies provide to research institutions.

LEIGH Griffiths saw off another challenge to his penalty prowess in Eibar last night - and this time he bravely backed it up.
The Celtic striker's hat-trick earned the Hoops a 4-1 win in a fraught and feisty friendly against the La Liga minnows.
But he needs to bat off another of his team-mates trying to cut his spot-kick grass to grab the first of them.
After Stefan Johansen undermining him into a miss in midweek, this time Nir Bitton asked the striker if he was OK to take it.
Griffiths kept his cool, though - and this time he smashed home sweetly.
The game, played for the 75th anniversary of the Basque country club, turned out to be a worthwhile exercise for boss Ronny Deila, despite question marks being raised of how wise it was taking it between Champions League qualifiers.
He stuck by his vow to field a strong side, only Craig Gordon and Mikael Lustig excused duties from midweek.
That mean a chance to give keeper Logan Bailly his first appearance, and the former Borussia OH Leuven look the part, saving a spot-kick and distributing the ball well.
Starting Griffiths up front with Nadir Ciftci off, Virgil van Dijk was also stretching his legs ahead of his comeback from European suspension on Wednesday alongside Dedryck Boyata.
That also meant a move to left back for Charlie Mulgrew, a possible precursor to him taking Emilio Izaguirre's place in midweek after the Honduran's shaky show against Stjarnan.
And if Deila wanted it competitive, he got it. In the first five minutes Eibar centre mid Eddy Sylvestre had laid out Nir Bitton with a thudding elbow-led challenge and Julen Iriarte twice got skipper Scott Brown irked with a couple of late and deliberate digs.
To be fair, it's exactly the kind of test they needed after their cobweb-strewn show on Wednesday.
Eibar - relegated after finishing 18th in la Liga, reprieved after Elche were sent down for tax irregularities in their place, and now hanging by a thread awaiting their rivals' appeal - weren't worst.
But once the pageantry and the pomp was done before kick off, one theme they couldn't lose was a decent chance being passed up though - and Nadir Ciftci still failed to break his duck, despite Leigh Griffiths sticking a great cross flush on his forehead six yards out, heading straight at the keeper.
Van Dijk matched him, squirting a free volley past from the same distance from a wonderful Mulgrew deep free kick.
Eibar's spot kick came in 25 minutes, Boyata sliding in to deny Nieto's shot at point blank range. The handball shout look harshly judged, considering the proximity of the impact - but Bailly bailed his fellow Belgian out with the save.
The stopper repaid the favour five minutes later, however, when the keeper lost the place at the edge of the box, gifting Endika Arandilla a lobbed shot which Boyata superbly scooped off the line.
The tempo was decent, and despite the temperature dropping from the oven of the Basque afternoon, Deila decided to make three changes at the break, Anthony Stokes, Efe Ambrose and Izaguirre coming in for Ciftci, Boyata and Mulgrew.
Eibar, on the other hand, took the luxury of changing their entire XI.
While they were busy sorting themselves out, though, Celtic took advantage, Ambrose stooping to head home a deadly Griffiths free kick.
And on the hour, the second came, sub keeper Andoni Errasti crazily clawing down Griffiths on the edge of the box, before the striker stepped up to smack it home off the inside of the post.
Deila instantly changed out another four, their jobs done, with Saidy Janko, Tom Rogic, Kieran Tierney and Jamie Lindsay coming on.
Replacing three quarters of their defence had left them looking a little vulnerable - although they were desperately unlucky to lose a goal to yet another questionable handball decision, this time Izaguirre taking one flush from a yard away.
Bailly was done this time, Mikel Arruabarrena going down the middle to put the home side on the scoresheet.
But the game wasn't done and neither was Griffiths, finishing things off with a nice step inside and a 25 yard strike off the inside of the other postm, before capitalising on another howler from the keeper to slot home his third at the death.
Leicester increased their lead at the top of the Championship table to seven points with a blistering attacking display and stylish victory over fellow promotion hopefuls Derby County.
Ritchie de Laet's fine individual goal rewarded City's early pressure and they could have led by five at half-time.
David Nugent's strike did make it 2-0 only for a De Laet own goal following a corner to give the Rams hope.
But Nugent's penalty and Jamie Vardy's strike sealed an emphatic win.
Foxes dominance Leicester have now won eight of their last nine games against Derby in all competitions and have beaten them three times this season.
The margin of victory in a thoroughly one-sided promotion derby could and should have been far greater.
But having seen his side completely outplay one of the their main promotion rivals and make it eight wins in nine matches against the Rams, Foxes boss Nigel Pearson is unlikely to be concerned.
Derby showed a few brief glimpses of the intricate play that has so impressed and helped them to 10 wins from 14 league games under manager Steve McClaren.

But Leicester posed a much greater and more persistent threat, with their more disciplined 4-4-2 formation bringing plenty of joy out wide against Derby's midfield trio.
The direct running and sheer pace of Dyer was the standout feature of a brilliant attacking first-half display while the Rams also never looked comfortable against Leicester's lively front duo of Vardy and Nugent.
Vardy sent a clever first-time flicked effort just wide with the outside of his foot and Nugent was unlucky with an acrobatic effort that Grant did well to push away at his near post.
The pressure finally told 25 minutes in and the goal was full of quality. De Laet broke from right-back, beating two men and playing a neat one-two with Nugent on the way, before firing a fine low shot past Grant.
Rams' form slipping Derby have now lost three games in a row - after winning eight ouf of nine before that
And the chances still continued to come, with Leicester hitting the bar twice in quick succession.
First Vardy was desperately unfortunate to see a strike from a tight angle hit the underside of the bar and bounce away to safety after Grant made a good save from Nugent's low strike.
And Liam Moore's towering header from a corner came back of the bar with Grant well beaten.
For all their dominance against a side who did not muster a shot on target but are the division's highest scorers, the lead was only 1-0 at the interval.

That changed almost immediately though and the home side side will feel they deserved the huge slice of luck that saw Nugent's shot rebound back off his legs and into the net.
The Rams brought on new loan signing Patrick Bamford and Mason Bennett up front and it helped bring their goal.
Bamford had a decent low strike blocked and from the corner that resulted the Rams dragged themselves back into the game when Jake Buxton's header was turned into his own net by De Laet.
But their hopes of an unlikely fightback were immediately hit as the Foxes broke from kick-off and Nugent coolly netted from the penalty spot after Craig Forsyth fouled Vardy to leave their boisterous fans in celebratory mood.
Vardy netted soon afterwards and Leicester cruised to victory with very few scares while the Rams were left to rue a missed chance to go second in the table.
Leicester boss Nigel Pearson:
"Derby is a good team but we got the balance right. We worked very hard and some of our attacking play was very, very good.
"When they got the goal back it was important we responded as quickly as we did because if we didn't then the feel of game may have been different.
"All in all it's a very good day for us. When you play ahead of the rest of the programme it's always nice to take advantage of it, and we played well and deserved it."
Derby boss Steve McClaren:
"Leicester is a very good team and top of table and on that performance you can see why, but we were well below our best - that wasn't the Derby team of recent months.
"But you can't maintain that sort of form all the time, you know you're going to have dips.
"To come to Leicester you need to be at your best, and tonight we weren't. It's a wake-up call for us and a realisation that there's a long way to go."
CODE supremo Bill Pulver has urged Queensland and NSW to keep exploring a bold State of Origin showdown in rugby union to spice up the calendar for next season.
Rugby union is unashamedly poaching rugby league's Origin concept just as the 13-a-side code created an iconic series in 1980 by copying an AFL idea.
New Queensland Rugby Union chief executive Richard Barker and NSW counterpart Andrew Hore have spoken about the possibility of organising a mid-year match to pep up a period of frustrating limbo in the Super Rugby season when the Wallabies enter Test mode.
Hatching a guaranteed crowd-puller like Origin Rugby would also add electricity to a June Test window where only Fiji, understrength Scotland and Italy are visiting because the British and Irish Lions are touring New Zealand.
media_camera Izzy a Blue or a Red?
“Andrew and I have talked about putting more rugby on the stage in that June period because you just can't have a Super Rugby competition that stops for a month and loses momentum,” Barker said.
“State of Origin is one of those ideas because rugby has to make some noise not just sit back.”
The hurdles are obvious but the reasons to find a way are even more compelling considering both the Reds and Waratahs must operate from the income of just seven home games rather than the eight they staged last year.
“Conceptually it's a great idea and we need open minds towards pulling it off if it's viable,” Pulver said.
“Richard and Andrew should keep developing the idea because the broad discussion about more content that drives revenue is a good one.”
Pulver said staging a Rugby Origin match in June when top players were “partitioned off” with the Wallabies was a hurdle to a top-strength game but eliminating the June Test window in years to come could create an opening.
media_camera Could we see George Smith in a blue jersey?
The June 30-July 1 weekend shapes as the only open date next year although a midweek night would be pulsating.
The Origin Rugby idea was most recently touted early last month by former Wallaby Daniel Herbert in his final weeks as Queensland Reds general manager.
No rugby league season goes by without an Origin eligibility squabble and Origin Rugby would be no different.
Fullback Israel Folau is rugby's biggest drawcard and played Origin league for Queensland when his state passions were clearly aligned.
He did so because he played his first senior rugby league for a club in Brisbane after finishing high school at a non-rugby school, Marsden State High, in the state. He was born in Sydney's west at Minto and played his first rugby for the NSW Waratahs where he has played for four seasons.
Wallaby lock Rory Arnold played first grade rugby for the first time at the Gold Coast Breakers but only because his first NSW rugby club, the Gentleman of Murwillumbah, never fielded a first grade team when he debuted for them. He is Wagga-born and plays for the ACT Brumbies so it is juicy eligibility conundrum.
media_camera Wallabies captain Stephen Moore is a proud Queenslander.
Australia may have five Super Rugby clubs but more than 80 per cent of the country's players are produced in Queensland or NSW which adds viability to the Origin Rugby concept.
The Western Force, ACT Brumbies and Melbourne Rebels would all have reservations about releasing players to a Queensland-NSW Origin clash which makes the ARU vital to broker a financial win for all parties.
“Obviously there is the issue of the other three clubs agreeing to release players and the player welfare question through RUPA but I'd like to think there would be a spirit of co-operation,” Pulver said.
Just how would the two Origin Rugby teams look. Try these line-ups.
QUEENSLAND:
Karmichael Hunt, Izzy Perese, Tevita Kuridrani, Samu Kerevi, Luke Morahan, Quade Cooper, Will Genia, Scott Higginbotham, David Pocock, Sean McMahon, Rob Simmons, Blake Enever, James Slipper, Stephen Moore, Ben Daley. Reserves (from): James Hanson, Sef Fa'agase, Angus Cottrell, Izack Rodda, Jarrad Butler, Matt Lucas, Nick Frisby, Bryce Hegarty, Jono Lance, Campbell Magnay, Chris Feauai-Sautia, Aidan Toua
NSW:

The 2016 Falcons were really good, and were really, really, really close to winning the Super Bowl. The Falcons had one of the most heartbreaking ends to a season in NFL history: at one point, the Falcons had a 499-in-500 shot of winning it all, and still lost. Can they possibly recover from this?
My first thought, honestly, was no. How could they? This was arguably the biggest gut punch in history: has any team, in any professional sport, at any time, been 99.8% likely to win a championship and then fail to do so?
But then I remembered the 1996 Broncos. Do you remember that team? Woody Paige wrote an article previewing the Broncos/Jaguars playoff matchup that well, you can read it for yourself. Suffice it to say, the Broncos weren't supposed to be challenged. The Broncos clinched the 1 seed early thanks to a 12-1 record, and were expected to ride to the Super Bowl unchallenged. Instead, a shocking upset left head coach Mike Shannahan saying “This is going to hurt and this is going to hurt for a long time.”
The Broncos, having already lost three Super Bowls with lesser teams, were supposed to finally win it all under John Elway. Instead, they had a heartbreaking loss… and responded by winning the next two Super Bowls.
How about the 2004 Steelers? Pittsburgh had gone 15-1 that year under rookie Ben Roethlisberger, and hosted the AFC Championship Game against the Patriots. Pittsburgh, thanks to future New England killer Plaxico Burress, dominated the Patriots during the regular season. The Steelers had already lost AFC Championship Games at home to San Diego ('94), Denver ('97), and New England ('01) under Bill Cowher, along with the Super Bowl against the Cowboys. But with the best quarterback of the Cowher era — and Roethlisberger entered the game with a 15-0 career record– things were supposed to be different.
And yet, for the fourth time in 11 years, Pittsburgh lost at home in the AFC Championship Game, a heartbreaking finish to a season. If not then, when could the Cowher Steelers ever win it all?
Well, the next year, in fact.
The '87 49ers were the best team in the NFL, and arguably the best team of the 49ers dynasty. But that San Francisco team was stunned in the playoffs:
Sitting through the shock at the bay is how San Francisco 49ers fans will remember a certain playoff Saturday, an occasion that was supposed to have been a walk through Candlestick Park on the way to San Diego and the Super Bowl. Instead, the 49ers will have to live with the final score and the indignity of the season that was theirs for the taking, or so it seemed. The Minnesota Vikings, league wild cards and everyone else's discards, pulled off what others deemed impossible. Not only did the Vikings defeat the 49ers, 36-24, before a crowd of 62,547, they defeated them soundly and advanced to the National Football Conference championship game next week.
San Francisco, admittedly, was different than Atlanta, Denver, or Pittsburgh because the 49ers had already won two Super Bowls (although some of the names had changed). Still, this was a heartbreaking loss, and the team responded by winning the next two Super Bowls.
And how about the Tom Landry Cowboys? In '66, Dallas lost a heartbreaker in the NFL Championship Game to the Packers (Green Bay went on to win Super Bowl I two weeks later). In '67, Dallas lost another heartbreaker in the NFL Championship Game — aka, the Ice Bowl — to the Packers (Green Bay went on to win Super Bowl II two weeks later). The next year, a 12-2 Cowboys lost in the playoffs to Cleveland. In 1969, an 11-2-1 Cowboys team lost at home in the playoffs to Cleveland. Then, in 1970, Dallas exercised their playoff demons and made it to the Super Bowl.
In that game, the Cowboys led 13-6 entering the 4th quarter, and Baltimore star Johnny Unitas had been knocked out of the game. With 9 minutes to go, Dallas had the ball and a touchdown lead… and then disaster struck: a Craig Morton interception led to a short touchdown, and another Morton interception led to a last second game-winning field goal. If Dallas couldn't win it all then, when could they?
The next year, as it turns out. Dallas made it all the way back, and then beat the Dolphins in Super Bowl VI. And it's worth noting that the Cowboys lost in Super Bowl V to the Colts… a team that two years earlier had their own heartbreak to deal with.
Below are 20 of the most heartbreaking ends to a season in the Super Bowl era, as identified by me after about 20 minutes of thought. As you can see, most of those teams rebounded from the collapse:
Team Year Rec Result Win % N+1 Record N+1 Win% N+1 Playoff Result ATL 2016 11-5 Lost up 28-3 0.688 CAR 2015 15-1 15-1; Lost in SB 0.938 6-10 0.375 Missed Playoffs SEA 2014 12-4 Interception at 1 0.750 10-6 0.625 Lost in Div Rd DEN 2012 13-3 Hail Mary + 2OT Loss as 1 seed 0.813 13-3 0.813 Lost in Super Bowl IND 2009 14-2 14-0 start; SB upset 0.875 10-6 0.625 Lost in WC Rd ARI 2008 9-7 Lost in SB with 73% Win Prob 0.563 10-6 0.625 Lost in Div Rd NWE 2007 16-0 18-0 season; Tyree catch 1.000 11-5 0.688 Missed Playoffs SDG 2006 14-2 14-2; 1 seed; Marlon McCree 0.875 11-5 0.688 Lost in AFCCG PIT 2004 15-1 15-1; Lost at home in AFCCG (again) 0.938 11-5 0.688 Won Super Bowl STL 2001 14-2 Super Bowl upset 0.875 7-9 0.438 Missed Playoffs TEN 1999 13-3 Dyson tackle in Super Bowl 0.813 13-3 0.813 Lost in Div Rd MIN 1998 15-1 15-1; missed FG in NFCCG 0.938 10-6 0.625 Lost in Div Rd DEN 1996 13-3 1 seed; Lost to Jags as 12.5 pt fav 0.813 12-4 0.750 Won Super Bowl HOU 1992 10-6 32 point comeback 0.625 12-4 0.750 Lost in Div Rd BUF 1990 13-3 Norwood miss in SB 0.813 13-3 0.813 Lost in Super Bowl CIN 1988 12-4 Up late in SB; Montana comeback 0.750 8-8 0.500 Missed Playoffs SFO 1987 13-2 Lost to Vikings as 11-pt fav 0.867 10-6 0.625 Won Super Bowl MIN 1970 12-2 Super Bowl upset 0.857 11-3 0.786 Lost in Div Rd DAL 1970 10-4 Cowboys - SB comeback 0.714 11-3 0.786 Won Super Bowl BAL 1968 13-1 Super Bowl upset 0.929 8-5-1 0.607 Missed Playoffs Avg 12.85-2.8 0.821 10.4-5.3 0.664
In general, these teams fared very well. Their win percentage regressed to the mean by about 50%, which is lower than you would typically expect. Just two of those teams — last year's Panthers and the 2001 Rams, who were torpedoed by quarterback injuries — were below .500 the next season. The '92 Oilers suffered the worst playoff loss in history (at least, pre-2016), but they responded well: Houston went 12-4 that season, although the Oilers did begin the year 1-4. If you thought the heartbreaking lost to Buffalo caused Houston to collapse and never recover, you just forgot about 1993. The Oilers collapsed to 2-14 in 1994, and moved to Tennessee three years later.
The '90 Bills would be another good comparison to the '16 Falcons: an upstart team with a great quarterback and an explosive offense losing in heartbreaking fashion in the Super Bowl. Buffalo, of course, made it back to the Super Bowl in each of the next three years.
And then you have the 2012-2014 Broncos. Denver lost in heartbreaking fashion in 2012, with Joe Flacco hitting Jacoby Jones for a 70-yard touchdown (sorry, Rahim Moore) forcing overtime in the playoffs. Denver eventually lost in double overtime. The next year, the Broncos set the NFL record for points in a season, made it to the Super Bowl, and then were embarrassed on the national stage by the Seahawks. In 2014, the Broncos went 12-4, but Peyton Manning was injured late in the season, and struggled mightily in a playoff loss at home to the Colts. After three years of heartbreak, and with Manning both injured and aging, it appeared Denver's window had closed. Instead? Denver won the Super Bowl in 2015.
For Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, and the Falcons, 2016 ended in one of the most painful ways possible. But that doesn't have to mean much for 2017.
Nothing was bigger in City Council President Todd Gloria's list of progressive goals for San Diego than his determination to put an increase to the minimum wage in San Diego on the November ballot.
When I first heard about this idea, months ago, it seemed it might just be a mirror of the state's plan to increase the minimum wage in 2016 — maybe just enforce it more quickly than the state planned.
But it appears to be much more bold.
Gloria said last night that the state plan is not enough. Money quote:
No one who works full-time should live in poverty. According to the Center on Policy Initiatives, 28 percent of full-time, year-round employees earned less than the $30,000, which is what is needed to live self-sufficiently in San Diego. A full-time minimum-wage job in San Diego pays about half that amount. Although California's minimum wage is scheduled to increase in 2016, that translates into an annual salary of less than $21,000, which is simply not enough in a city with a high a cost of living like ours.
He didn't lay out the specifics but a minimum wage that would translate to $30,000 would be about $14.50 an hour.
Gloria's spokeswoman, Katie Keach, said they hadn't landed on a figure but didn't shoot down $14.50 an hour: “I'm quite certain a specific amount hasn't been set and research continues on that. Your estimate doesn't sound far-fetched considering the context of the speech last night,” she told me in an email.
The minimum wage in California is $8 an hour. The state plans to raise it to $9 this year and $10 in 2016.
If the city of San Diego goes from $8 to $14.50, it would be an increase of 81 percent.
A conservative billionaire is helping lead a separate push to accelerate the statewide increase up to $12 an hour by 2016.
A minimum wage above $14 would rival jurisdictions everywhere. Voters in SeaTac, the city between Seattle and Tacoma that is mostly composed of the airport, recently approved a minimum wage increase to $15 an hour.

High school tends to be a miserable time for people like me. I wish I could say high school was rough, but it wasn't. I was a standout athlete in cross-country and track and field. A gifted student, taking Advanced Placement courses and scoring high marks on placement exams. I was recruited by Boston College, an institution of both academic and athletic prowess. After two practices each day, I mustered the energy to finish homework and dinner before my exhaustion won over. There was no time to question a sexuality that to me, seemed so wrong.
My life took a major turn my freshman year of college. I saw everything I had worked for collapse right in front of my eyes. My collegiate opener saw my slowest time since sophomore year of high school, barely making it past the finish line. Then, a bone scan revealed two stress fractures in my right tibia. For the first time since I was 10, I wasn't running. I began hour-long sessions of aqua jogging in solitude as part of my recovery process.
It took maybe three weeks of that for me to realize I was gay.
For several weeks, I convinced myself that if I tried hard enough, I could be straight. I would talk to my roommates about the "hottest girls," dancing with many at parties. I tried everything. After three months of exhausting all my options, I realized it wasn't working and slowly began the process of coming out.
Coming out is something magical. Most people hate it. I know I sure did, but it's a test of character. Coming out is not an unveiling of one's sexuality, but an affirmation of self-identity. It made me realize who I was, rather than who I am. It was the comfort and reassurance from a high school friend and his cousin who had both come out that gave me the ability to say those three seemingly daunting words: "I am gay."
Over the course of three gruesome months, I told family, friends and even strangers. All were extremely receptive, except for my father, who threatened me, in front of my oldest sister and mother, to leave the house and take his own life because he felt dishonored and ashamed. I didn't speak to my father for three months. Feelings of extreme anguish and pain deteriorated my once lively spirit. With the acceptance and support of my track teammates, I survived this miserable time.
Now, I'm beginning my junior year at Boston College. In the past year-and-a-half of living as an openly gay male, I've worked with the Toronto Blue Jays and You Can Play, making the world of athletics a safer place to play. I am a Collegiate Ambassador for GO! Athletes, the first national network for LGBTQ Athletes. I am part of my university's Undergraduate Government Body as the Assistant Director of Programming for the LGBTQ Leadership Council. I plan on co-founding the first association for Hispanic and Latino gay men this semester at Boston College. As for the running, after a slew of injuries, my coach and I decided it was best to take some time off. Despite this break, I still consider myself an athlete.
Being an athlete is not a badge you wear. It is not a level you reach. It is not a record you hold. An athlete is the discipline you develop, the integrity you hold in the blood and sweat you work for, and the love for a game that tests your strength, courage and heart.
It is very much like being gay.
It's not a flag we wave; it's the pride in the flag. It's not a word we say; it's the strength exhibited by using that word. It's not the size of our community; it's the size of our hearts. If we let someone else define what being gay is, what our pride is, we have lost our integrity. We have lost our strength. We have lost our courage.
In six short months, several athletes of the LGBT community will compete in what is considered the most prestigious athletic event to exist, the Olympic Games. These athletes endured gruesome practices and sacrificed more than we will ever know. They have dedicated themselves for a chance to achieve greatness. They will also be in a country that has just passed major anti-gay laws. Many of our LGBT athletes face the possibility of harassment, intimidation, and even imprisonment for simply being who they are.
It seems as though coming out of the closet once isn't enough.
Many of us came out of the closet knowing there would be consequences. We would lose family members. Lose friends. Lose jobs. Live a life of much discrimination. A life of fear. But did we remain in the closet? Did we retreat and express ourselves only in places of comfort? No. We opened that door and prepared ourselves for the hell we knew was coming.
The message is simple: Russia and the International Olympic Committee want the LGBT community to go back in the closet and hide their identities. I say screw that, we are proud of who we are and we should remain who we are.
To the athletes competing in Sochi, show up with pride in yourself, pride in your country, and pride in the LGBT community. To the thousands of spectators, keep supporting those who need your support most. To our beloved allies, continue to resonate the strength and voice you have done for us in the past.
We have the opportunity to show Russia and the rest of the world the strength and love of our community at Sochi next year. We have a chance to show the Russian LGBT community that they are not forgotten. We will bring hope to a place where much does not exist for a very suppressed community. The IOC may not support us, but when has a governing body ever stopped us from accomplishing greatness? The LGBT community, as history shows, has relied on itself to overcome the injustices that have been presented upon it.
Life is one fabulous race. We train, make mistakes and tap unknown potential. We hit our peaks and our lows. We face barriers like homophobia and people like my father. We get injured with laws that deny and restrict us. In the end, whether we finished the race with a personal best, an all-time low or didn't even cross the finish line, we can say we started the race. These next six months will be the most important race for our LGBT athletes; we don't know how their race will finish; yet they all deserve to start. And that's why we'll be there cheering for them through the finish line.

Queen's Park is once again mooting reform of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, including privatizing it. However, the province must do much more than “maximize the value of the LCBO's assets.” It needs to open up beer and wine retailing to improve choices and lower prices for consumers and increase government revenues. Government regulations limit off-winery or brewery sales to the LCBO, a single private beer retailer and a fixed number of off-winery wine stores. Provincial laws have resulted in private quasi-monopolies for both beer and wine retailers. Three large brewers — not the province — own The Beer Store. Most of Ontario's private off-winery stores are owned by two large winemakers, and this gives them an extra outlet to sell their wines, including those that contain as little as 25 per cent Canadian grape juice.
Reform of Ontario's alcohol retail system should involve freeing up competition in wine and beer sales, not only privatizing the LCBO, write Paul R. Masson and Anindya Sen. ( Andrew Francis Wallace / Toronto Star )
So not only do consumers have a limited set of choices, but the larger breweries and wineries have a leg up over the smaller ones. Reform of the system should involve freeing up competition in wine and beer retailing, not only privatizing the LCBO. Effective competition requires free entry. The government should open up beer and wine retailing to all stores willing to pay a licensing fee to do so. This would help to level the playing field between large and small producers. If private retailers were free to offer foreign as well as domestic products, that would get around the limit on off-winery stores that is a legacy of carve-outs in NAFTA. And it would provide effective competition for the LCBO, regardless of whether the province privatizes it. Quebec offers a good model for expanded competition for the government alcohol retailer. In Quebec, convenience and grocery stores can sell beer and wine. Although hobbled by requirements that the wine they sell is bottled in Quebec, grocery stores compete with the provincially owned Société des Alcools du Québec. In our new study, we show that beer prices are on average 6 to 9 per cent lower in Quebec grocery stores than in Ontario, after taking account of taxes and other fees.

Of course there are objections to reform — most vocally from those benefiting from the status quo. The LCBO pays generous salaries and has less incentive than a private company to keep costs under control. Despite this, it also pays a generous dividend to the government, thanks to its ability to charge a hefty markup over its costs. Why would the government want to butcher the goose that lays the golden eggs? But privatization need not lead to lower government revenues. British Columbia and Alberta now have partial or full privatization of alcoholic beverage retailing. Despite this, they have higher per capita government profits from alcohol than other Western provinces that still have monopolies, after controlling for other factors such as per capita income. The old arguments from the First World War-era Temperance Movement that the government must retail alcoholic beverages no longer hold much water. The government can address minimum drinking age rules and health concerns through enforcement, not ownership. And in fact the LCBO now advertises its products, much as a private retailer would. Reform of alcoholic beverage retailing in Ontario is long overdue. It no longer makes sense to have a government retailer and private quasi-monopolies selling beer and wine. Freeing up retailing to allow entry of private stores would mean consumers would enjoy lower prices and greater choice. Open competition would improve the relative position of smaller breweries and wineries. The government would be able to maintain and even increase its revenue from the sector. Alcoholic beverage retailing reform can be a win-win situation. Queen's Park should not flinch from making the necessary changes. Paul R. Masson and Anindya Sen are authors of the C.D. Howe Institute publication Uncorking a Strange Brew: The Need for More Competition in Ontario's Alcoholic Beverage Retailing System, to be released on Aug. 20.
​Stoke City are looking to strengthen their defensive options after reportedly making a £5.3m bid for Tottenham Hotspur defender Federico Fazio.
According to Spanish website ​El Correo, Mark Hughes is eager to capitalise on the centre-back's position at White Hart Lane, having fallen down the pecking order under Mauricio Pochettino.
The towering Argentine has made only one appearance this season, a rather shaky performance in the Capital One Cup against Arsenal - a match Spurs lost 2-1.
El Correo say Stoke City have made a £5.3million bid for Federico Fazio but he only wants to join Sevilla #COYS pic.twitter.com/8Xb38WtKdH — Harry Charalambous (@PrimeSpur1992) January 31, 2016
Indeed, Fazio has been named in the matchday squad on only five occasions this season and doesn't look to be a part of Pochettino's plans.
Hughes is keen to bolster his defence and balance his squad, who have earned plaudits this season for reshaping the identity of Stoke with exciting attacking talents like Xherdan Shaqiri, Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic helping propel the Potters to ninth in the table.
However, Stoke may face stiff competition in the shape of Sevilla, who Fazio reportedly views as his favourable destination, should he decide to leave North London.
Stoke face a real danger in missing out too, considering Fazio played for the La Liga side 197 times before joining Spurs in 2014. Whatever happens, it does look as though Fazio's forgettable spell with Spurs is inching towards a conclusion.

It has been 23 days.
Twenty-three days since nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from their school in the village of Chibok, in northern Nigeria. They were in the midst of writing their exams. Now they are under threat of being sold into slavery by an armed militia.
Story continues below advertisement
Their 'crime' was a desire to get an education. These girls will someday be our doctors and engineers and teachers. It is not just young people who have been taken. They are holding Nigeria's future to ransom.
I grew up a few hours to the west of Warabe, in the city of Zaria. As an adult, I have lived throughout the world – attending college in the United States, playing professional basketball in Europe.
Eventually, I found my way to Toronto. I have a good life in a wonderful, cosmopolitan city, but I am everywhere a son of Africa.
My wife is also African. Our daughter was born here. Given a different set of circumstances and less luck, she might have been born elsewhere, perhaps even some place where children are abducted. A place where little girls are taken because someone did not want them to learn.
Though I have travelled the world and known success, I still remember my childhood in Nigeria as the best time of my life. Even today, my family and friends talk often about those days. It was a peaceful, hopeful place. I was allowed to dream there. My sisters shared those dreams.
In that Nigeria, we grew up surrounded by neighbours of all religions, all sorts of people with all sorts of beliefs. Most of all, I remember that we were happy.
Things have changed. The Nigeria of my youth no longer exists. The country has been ravaged by corruption. That corruption is deeply rooted in society, and goes beyond the administration. As a result, the military and other security agencies are not equipped for this kind of search across vast and difficult terrain. The Nigerian government has never faced a threat quite like this one.

Nigerians have always found a way to work around their own government. We now have the largest economy in Africa. We are a smart, loving and joyous people.
Lacking even the most basic infrastructure, we have found a way to make our society work. We are also a people who have, for many years, swept many things under the rug in the interest of peace. This tragedy – this atrocity – cannot be ignored in that way. What will we tell our own daughters if we do nothing for the daughters of our countrymen and women?
We Africans must be able to believe in ourselves. I believe strongly this is a continent with unlimited potential and a bright future. Those of us in the diaspora must do all we can to encourage Africa's youth. The only reason we have been given an opportunity, is so that we may pass it along to others.
However, this is a crisis that Nigeria cannot solve by itself. I am speaking because sport has given me a voice that rings out in North America. I want to do whatever is in my power to help end this tragedy.
But we also need the world's help. The mothers of these girls have done all they can to save their children – by capturing international attention. These women cannot mount a rescue operation. I urge the international community to join in the United States' offer to aid in on-the-ground efforts to safely recover Nigeria's missing children. France and United Kingdom have made similar outreach. Canada has offered to send surveillance equipment to help in the effort.
I urge my adopted home to continue to do all it can to help.

This is a great step in the right direction, given the complexities of international law and other diplomatic problems. I trust that the Nigerian government will accept those courtesies extended by our neighbours in the international community.
I am also asking you to ask yourselves – ' Is there anything I can do to help them?'
I am asking you to help save Nigeria's daughters.
The General Motors Ultralite was a 1992 low emission vehicle concept car intended to demonstrate the benefits of advanced materials and low fuel consumption.
The goal was to make a four-passenger show car capable of 100 miles per US gallon (2.4 L/100 km; 120 mpg ‑imp ).[1] It was rated at 88 miles per US gallon (2.7 L/100 km; 106 mpg ‑imp ) by the EPA,[2] but could achieve 100 miles per US gallon (2.4 L/100 km; 120 mpg ‑imp ) at a steady state cruising speed of 50 mph.[3]
The carbon fiber shell was fabricated by Scaled Composites and it weighed only 420 pounds (191 kg). The total weight of the car was 1,400 pounds (635 kg).
The car had gullwing doors and no B-pillar.[4] The C d was 0.19, significantly lower compared to production cars of the decade.
Its three-cylinder 1.5 L two-stroke engine could produce 111 hp (83 kW), which made a speed of 135 mph (217 km/h) possible. The car could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 8 seconds.[5]
The shape was reminiscent of the Ford Probe concept, and the Ultralite presaged the production General Motors EV1 electric vehicle and other production models.
In popular culture [ edit ]
Due to the unusual design the Ultralite has been featured in several science fiction productions, most prominently among them was in the 1993 film Demolition Man as the squad cars used by the fictional SAPD (San Angeles Police Department). They also appeared in the second episode of the second season of seaQuest DSV, and in the 1999 movie Bicentennial Man.

In the week in which the Russians escalated their attacks on the Syrian factions being assisted by the United States and what is left of the Western Alliance, and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas renounced the long-dead letter of the Oslo Agreement (for which his predecessor Yasser Arafat and the Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres shared a Nobel Peace Prize, and which the Palestinians have never honored), and as our NATO ally Turkey assisted the dementedly violent Islamic State (ISIS), which the rest of NATO opposes, at least verbally, there must be someone in the White House — apart from janitors and the Marines who open the doors for invited visitors – who senses the tattered state of American policy in the region. The bipartisan wall of steel, from George W. Bush to Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama, vociferously supported by the British and French leaders of the time, that swore that Iran would be prevented from achieving nuclear weapons whatever happened, gradually metamorphosed into the facilitation of a militarily nuclear Iran in ten years, if the Iranians, in their own free determination of their interest, choose to wait that long. President Jimmy Carter, another Nobel Prize winner, was instrumental in replacing the shah with the ayatollahs in Iran in 1978; he has lived long enough to see the bitter fruit of what he helped to sow.

President George H. W. Bush has certainly seen the consequences of not removing Saddam Hussein when he very effectively cleared Saddam out of Kuwait. President Bill Clinton must have some idea that if he had responded more firmly to the initial terrorist attacks on the U.S. by Muslim extremists, at the first attack on the World Trade Center, and the ones on the Khobar Towers, the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and on the U.S.S. Cole (1993–98), there might have been some chance of averting 9/11. George W. Bush may perhaps have some idea that plunging into Iraq a second time, claiming the existence there of a nascent nuclear program that could not be found, disbanding the 400,000 members of the Iraqi armed forces and police with retention of their weapons and munitions — ensuring that the country would become a bloodbath — and promoting the democratic election of antidemocratic forces in Gaza, Lebanon, and Egypt may not have been wise policy after all. The Arab Spring that may conceivably have achieved something useful in Tunisia has generated chaos in Libya and Syria, and only a generous Providence and astute general staff in Cairo prevented the metamorphosis of Egypt into a theocracy run by the elements that assassinated Anwar Sadat. But there is no sign that the White House of that latest American Nobel Peace laureate, Barack Obama, has any misgivings about his desertion of the democratic forces in Iran, his U-turn on Iranian nuclear weapons, his vanishing red line in Syria, or the “reset” of Russian relations leading to the Russians' attacking America's protégés in Syria, whom Obama finally condescended to assist several years after complacently telling President Assad he had to go. (Obama will go before Assad does.)

He seems still to be contemplating the accrued prestige, in the opinion of Washington's most deferential media commentator on the administration, Tom Friedman of the New York Times, of having laid out a “doctrine” as James Monroe, Henry Stimson, and Harry Truman did. Those declared the Americas inaccessible to further colonization, declined to recognize territorial acquisitions by force, and undertook to assist local forces attacked, internally or externally, by aggressive Communist organizations. Friedman and Obama worked out this new doctrine as having the courage to make preemptive, ex gratia concessions to hostile countries in the belief that they would then behave less abrasively, given that the U.S. had an immensely greater military capability than the countries it was appeasing. The delusional vanity of this administration will presumably depart official circles with the outgoing president, but Americans should not imagine that rebuilding American credibility in the world is going to be easy or fast.

Taking a 40-year view of the Middle East, which is not an especially long cycle in such an ancient part of the world, the United States started with Turkey, Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Israel, as close and reliable allies, and stable, if not very amiable, regimes in Syria, Iraq, and Libya; and was set to build on the ceasefires that Henry Kissinger had negotiated after the Yom Kippur War and the better relations between Egypt and Israel that were emerging (and that President Carter did bring to fruition at Camp David, for which he deserved but did not specifically receive the Nobel Prize). Now it is every man for himself in the region (women have no influence): Iran and its Islamist puppets are violently hostile to the U.S.; Turkey is quite hostile; there is little warmth in U.S. relations with Israel; and Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States will take what they can get from the U.S., especially anti-missile defenses, but have no confidence in nor any reservoir of good will with it. No one can explain why the United States helped evict the Shah, why President Reagan tried to conciliate Tehran in the Iran-Contra affair, why the Bushes led two invasions of Iraq in twelve years, why the U.S. led a huge alliance into Afghanistan — after NATO determined for the first time in its history that the entire alliance had been attacked at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon — only to then decamp to Iraq, leaving its allies in Afghanistan with an ambiguous mission and grossly insufficient forces. No one understands why the U.S. turned on its allies such as Mubarak and the democratic forces in Iran and Iraq, why it has let the Kurds down so badly, and why it consented to be taken over the barrel by Pakistan, which never ceased to support Taliban factions in Afghanistan that were killing American and NATO soldiers every week. The Russians are back in the Middle East (in Syria) for the first time since 1973, and are directly engaged there militarily for the first time ever. Given the overwhelming strength of the U.S. Air Force and Naval Air Forces, the insolent Russian command for the United States last week to vacate Syrian airspace within an hour, before it bombed factions allied to the U.S., would, under any president of the U.S. since the first flight of the Wright Brothers (1903), have led to a rejoinder that would have caused Russia to amend its behavior. This administration sulked off and whined about “unprofessional” Russian conduct.
Apart from expelling Saddam from Kuwait and the summary execution of Osama bin Laden (whom our Pakistani allies had been sheltering), none of any of it has made any sense since Camp David. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. to assemble coalitions to support its wildly varying Middle East enterprises. All civilization except the fragile king of Jordan joined the first Gulf War to evict Saddam from Kuwait. No country seriously opposed chasing the Mullah Omar and bin Laden out of Afghanistan. Recruitment was pretty patchy for the Second Iraq War, and there is a distinct lack of confidence in the anti-ISIS operation, which Obama modestly presented to the American people as “American leadership at its best.” Erratic leadership ends up without many voluntary followers.
It seems inevitable that a regional carve-up of spheres of influence will occur eventually.
The Arab powers are unanimous in their hate for Assad, as an Iranian stooge. It will not be long before the Arabs find the Russian presence among them quite irritating, as Sadat did more than 40 years ago, and especially as the Russians are propping up what they consider to be a turncoat Iranian Trojan Horse. As long as Iran doesn't blow up the region with its newly legitimized nuclear weapons after rushing them to completion and deployment, either directly or by giving them to terrorist organizations, it seems inevitable that a regional carve-up of spheres of influence will occur eventually. Any plausible American presidential candidate — while his pledges to “rip up the nuclear agreement with Iran” are just bravura, as that would isolate America and be an unwise violation of international law — will hold Iran to the letter of the agreement. Post-Obama, mercifully, a violation by Iran will not lead to the fiction of “snapback sanctions,” but to the darkening of the skies of Persia by U.S. air power, in whatever numbers and with whatever frequency of return is necessary to disincentivize the Tehran theocracy from achieving deliverable nuclear weapons.

A serious American administration, and there is ample reason for hope that one will be elected next year, could play a valuable role in finding a durable evolution from the hegemony of the Ottoman Empire, which the British and French tried unsuccessfully to rewrite after World War I. Apart from a special status for Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon, the Turks, Iranians, and Egyptians will assert more or less demarcated spheres of influence between themselves, and the Saudis will protect and mentor the Gulf States. If there were any justice, the Kurds would at least have an autonomous zone in northern Iraq, but there is little justice in the Middle East and the Kurds are more likely to be partitioned again, as they have been, like Poland in the 18th century.

Russia and the West can presumably help semi-civilized Sunni elements in Syria and Iraq from being taken over by ISIS, which is reassuringly small though irrationally barbarous. If the Kurds can defeat ISIS, as they have, the sane Syrians and Iraqis can, especially with the support of the Iranians, Saudis, Russians, and the West, and despite the outrageous meddling of the Turks. But Assad is ultimately doomed, which, along with the influx of Syrians into Lebanon, should end Iran's ability to torment and provoke Israel via Hezbollah, which became preeminent in Lebanon thanks to George W. Bush's enthusiasm for democracy in inappropriate places. With Israel surrounded by a benign Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan (which is increasingly dependent on Israeli offshore energy resources), with the local Sunni Arabs becalmed under some sort of Turco-Egyptian suzerainty, the Palestinians would finally have to become somewhat serious about a two-state solution that accepts Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and with the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine.
It is possible to imagine an optimistic end to the present chaos. But it will take some time for this country to live down the disasters of the last two presidencies.

Almost as many people have died from suicide in Northern Ireland since the signing of the Good Friday agreement as were killed during the entire Troubles.
The Detail, an investigative news website based in Belfast, has examined 15 years of suicide data as part of its Legacy series which examines issues linked to the Northern Ireland conflict. The Legacy reports were carried out with the support of the North's Community Relations Council and the series is being published in partnership with The Irish Times .
It has been estimated that around 3,600 people were killed in Northern Ireland's bloody conflict between 1969 and 1997.
Northern Ireland Statistic and Research Agency (NISRA) figures show that a total of 3,288 suicides were registered in Northern Ireland from the beginning of 1998 to the end of 2012 - 77% were men. The 2012 figures are provisional.
The highest number of deaths registered between 1998 and 2012 was in Belfast where 718 people took their own lives over the 15 year period. The lowest number was in Moyle District Council area where 31 people died from suicide.
The highest suicide rate over the last three years was in the most deprived council area (Belfast) and the lowest was in the least deprived area (Magherafelt).
The average annual suicide rate per 100,000 of the population based on the last three years' data (2010-12) was 24 deaths in Belfast compared to seven in Magherafelt.
All suspected suicides are referred to the coroner and take time to be investigated. This means that there can be a substantial period of time between a death occurring and it being registered.
For example, of the 313 suicides registered in 2010, only 141 actually occurred in 2010 with the remainder taking place in earlier years.
The impact of the Troubles
Research by Professor Mike Tomlinson at Queen's University Belfast published in 2012 concluded that the conflict in Northern Ireland had a profound effect on suicide rates. He said that the steep increase in recent years may be accounted for by those who grew up in the 1970s during the worst years of the violence.
View Suicides in Northern Ireland 1998-2012 in a full screen map
He examined 40 years of death registration data and found that the highest suicide rate was for men aged 35-44.
New research carried out by a team at the University of Ulster confirms that people in Northern Ireland who experienced a conflict-related traumatic event are even more likely than those who experienced other types of trauma to have suicidal thoughts and plans.
The research team from the Bamford Centre for Mental Health and Well-Being at the University of Ulster has examined the link between conflict-related events and suicide attempts in Northern Ireland.
Their analysis of data from over 4,000 people - collected in 2008 for a World Mental Health Survey initiative - backs the suggestion that traumatic events associated with the Northern Ireland conflict are associated with suicidal thoughts and plans.
The results are due to be officially published later this year.
Professor Siobhan O'Neill, who is leading the research, said: “Suicidal ideation (thoughts) and behaviour are important public health issues, not least because they give us an insight into the factors associated with death by suicide.
“There are many causes of suicide and it is a complex issue. Mental disorders are an important risk factor with the majority of those who die by suicide having a mental disorder.
“However, most people with a mental disorder do not go on to die by suicide and many people who die by suicide have no recorded mental health disorder.
“It is therefore important that the associations between suicide and other factors, such as trauma, are examined.”
The World Mental Health Survey Initiative found high rates of mental disorders in Northern Ireland with the rates of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in the north the highest of all the countries involved in the initiative.
The Department of Health's view
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health in the north said that reduction in the suicide rate continues to be a major priority for the department.
She said: “Over £7 million is allocated annually to suicide prevention in Northern Ireland. This is more per head of population than any other UK country.
“Suicide is a very complex societal issue and the reasons for the relatively high rate of suicide in Northern Ireland are not known.
“However, it is clear that poverty, recession, deprivation, the legacy of the conflict, exposure to violence, and higher levels of mental health needs are all influencing factors.”

Reporters Without Borders has branded Iran as the new champion in journalistic repression, which won't come as much of a shock for anyone following the crisis of the past week. Five days ago, the BBC reported that foreign press had been confined to their offices or homes, and forbidden to report on anything in Iran without official approval. Now they're being confined in the more traditional manner (via Newsbeat1):
The Islamic Republic of Iran now ranks alongside China as the world's biggest prison for journalists. The crackdown has been intensified yet again following Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's endorsement of the result of the 12 June presidential election and the opposition's decision to call another demonstration on 20 June. Iran now has a total of 33 journalists and cyber-dissidents in its jails, while journalists who could not be located at their homes have been summoned by telephone by Tehran prosecutor general Said Mortazavi. “The force of the demonstrations in Tehran is increasing fears that more Iranian journalists could be arrested and more foreign journalists could be expelled,” Reporters Without Borders said. “The regime has been visibly shaken by its own population and does not want to let this perception endure. That is why the media have become a priority target.” The press freedom organisation added: “The international community cannot continue to ignore the situation. It must have a clear and unanimous reaction that is proportionate to the gravity of these events. And there will never be any question of recognising the results of the 12 June election.”
Maybe they should direct those remarks to the White House, especially that last statement. Not only will Barack Obama accept those results, he wants direct talks with the people who fabricated them to keep their hold on power.
RSF (from the French Reporters Sans Frontières) lists a number of reporters that have gone missing, been arrested, or ordered to leave the country. It also notes that a portal for reporting has been shut down:
After being blocked since 11 June, the Iranian news website Entekhab (www.entekhabnews.com) has now been closed down on the orders of the Tehran prosecutor general.
Its most recent stories report that Mousavi criticized the extra polling time demanded by Ahmadinejad, the swine-flu outbreak in Israel, and that Palestinians rescued a family of “Israeli occupiers.” The last update appears to be from June 13th, the day after the election and the day when protests erupted across Iran. Iran doesn't even want it open for official reports, let alone the possibility that the repression and violence the regime is perpetrating might leak out in the form of reporting, pictures, and video.
RSF has taken a tougher stand on Iran and oppression than the White House. Shouldn't that embarrass the current occupants?
...they faced the prospect of performing frequency domain intra-prediction involving multiple, nonhomogeneous input and output block sizes. Aside from just being complicated, each possible combination would require its own set of prediction matrices, some quite large. The combinatorics alone render this scheme impractical. Wouldn't it be nice if they could change blocksizes by splitting blocks apart and merging blocks together? It would avoid the whole problem!
As it turns out, they ...ahem... we can! To escape certain death under a crushing mound of different blocksizes, we borrow a previous invention, Time/Frequency Resolution Switching ('TF' for short), from our Opus audio codec. TF allows us to split apart or merge together blocks while staying in the frequency domain. By altering the blocksizes, we can eliminate the nonhomogeneity and reduce both the size and number of required prediction matrices. For example, we could TF surrounding blocks to match the size of our input block, or always run prediction at a 4x4 blocksize.
TF is useful in a number of other places as well, so it's worth describing in some detail. Let's start by looking at what we want, what we really need, and then how TF delivers.
Constraints Wishlist
Obviously, we want TF to be as cheap to compute as possible. We'd like to avoid multiplies if possible, and reversing and re-computing the DCT for each blocksize is right out. It would also be nice if our transform showed uniform/unit scaling, minimal dynamic range expansion, and complete reversibility.
In short, what we really wish we could do is switch between multiple lapped blocksizes as if we'd done DCTs for every possible combination, and we want it for as close to free as possible. Not surprisingly, it turns out we can't get everything we want.
Our lapped transform uses a fast DCT, a member of the FFT family. All FFT-like transform structures begin with an initial 'butterfly' that operates pairwise on interleaved samples spread across the spatial input. Even though we can split most of a DCT in half down the middle of the input block, we can't split the first step. To merge two blocks or split blocks in half such that they're equivalent to the other transform size, we would in fact have to unwind all the way back to the spatial domain and recalculate the entire DCT.
So, we can't split a DCT in half or merge two DCTs together without first unrolling them, and unrolling is too expensive. Even if we did, we'll run into lapping issues that still rob us of perfect victory. However we do this, we'll have to be satisfied with an approximation to the perfect TF transform we wish we could have.
To find this approximation, we ask ourselves "What are we really trying to do?" When we merge four blocks together into a single larger block, we're beginning with four neighboring frequency-domain blocks. These blocks may be frequency coefficients, but the relationship between coefficients in neighboring blocks is spatial. We want to transform that spatial relationship into the frequency domain. Splitting is the converse, converting a frequency relationship into a spatial relationship.
Ironically enough, we do this with a DCT! Taking four colocated frequency coefficients from neighboring blocks, a 2x2 forward DCT converts their spatial relationship into frequency. Similarly, taking a 2x2 block of frequency coefficients from a single block and using an inverse DCT, we convert their frequency relationship into a spatial relationship. The resulting output is not the same as recomputing the entire DCT of a different blocksize from scratch, but it does give us the frequency-domain approximation we're looking for— and the 2x2 case involves no multiplies.
Walsh-Hadamard
We also need a four-point transform to transform 4x4 blocks to 16x16 blocks and vice versa. Unfortunately, a four-point DCT requires multiplies. Of course, we could use a two-point DCT to transform from 4x4 to 8x8 and then use a two-point DCT again from 8x8 to 16x16. The resulting transform isn't a DCT though; it's a Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT).
Technically, the two-point DCT and WHT (and Haar Wavelet Transform for that matter) are equivalent. As we've just noted, you can't build a larger DCT by stacking smaller DCTs. However, stacking two identical Walsh-Hadamard transforms does result in a WHT of twice the size. Since the two-point cases are the same, that's why our stacked 2x2 'DCT' magically transformed into a 4x4 WHT.
As transform size increases, the WHT remains cheap to compute (no multiplies). In Daala, of course, we need only the 2x2 and 4x4 WHT.
Invertibility and Scaling: More Velcro ® !

The remaining properties on our wishlist are unit/uniform scaling (all outputs are scaled by a factor of 1), minimal range expansion, and exact reversibility in an integer implementation. We used lifting filters before to implement a lapped transform with these properties, so we'll use more lifting to do the same for TF. This is a bit low-level, but it's fun to walk through the logic of designing the lifts.
Our 2x2 transform is pretty simple. The dimensions are separable, so we can run a 2 point WHT on the rows, and then run it again on the columns. The basis functions for the two point WHT are [1,1] and [1,-1], scaled as we see appropriate. So we do the obvious thing; design a lift that computes the outputs as [a+b, a-b]:
lifting pseudocode: b := a - b; a := (2*a) - b;
It's simple and gives the right answer. Of course, it has an obvious problem; the output is scaled up by a factor of √2 with each step. After we stack them, the final 2x2 transform's output will be scaled up by a factor of two and the dynamic range quadrupled.
We can't simply shift down both outputs at the end, and scaling each leg by √.5 involves multiplications. We'll need to find some other way to build a lifting stage that doesn't scale the output. Here's another attempt:
lifting pseudocode: b := a - b; a := a - (b/2);
This achieves the goal of not scaling the overall output, but now the output scaling isn't uniform. The upper leg's output is scaled by half relative to the lower leg. This is the choice we appear to be stuck with: the outputs being scaled up, or output scale asymmetry.
If we play with the asymmetric scaling choice a bit longer, we'll notice we can swap the relative scaling asymmetry between outputs by shifting operations around. Compare:
lifting pseudocode: a := a + b; b := (a/2) - b;
We can also push the asymmetry to the other side and design lifting stages that take asymmetrically scaled inputs and produce symmetrically scaled outputs:
lifting pseudocode: a := a + (b/2); b := a - b; lifting pseudocode: b := (a/2) - b; a := a - b;
At this point, we have a little collection of four asymmetric lifting stages. Each reversibly computes a 2 point WHT without scaling the overall output, but the individual outputs/inputs are asymmetrically scaled relative to each other. Then we realize these asymmetries are all complementary!
Since the starting inputs are implicitly symmetrically scaled, we start the 2x2 transform using the lifting stages that expect symmetric inputs. The first transform applies to the even column, and the second to the odd column. This produces asymmetrically scaled intermediate values:
Then we can use the stages that expect asymmetrically scaled inputs to transform the columns:
String it all together, and we have a complete 2x2 WHT transform:
lifting pseudocode: b := a - b; a := a - (b/2); c := c + d; d := (c/2) - d; a := a + (c/2); c := a - c; d := (b/2) - d; b := b - d;
Some easy transformations get the operation count down to seven adds and one shift per four pixels if we use an extra register. Starting by reordering the operations:
lifting pseudocode: b := a - b; c := c + d; a := a - (b/2); a := a + (c/2); d := (c/2) - d; d := (b/2) - d; c := a - c; b := b - d;
Alter the signs and ordering around d to eliminate the successive negations:
lifting pseudocode: b := a - b; c := c + d; a := a - (b/2); a := a + (c/2); d := d + (b/2); d := d - (c/2); c := a - c; b := b - d;
And now we see that we can arithmetically collapse several operations if we use an extra register, e:
lifting pseudocode: b := a - b; c := c + d; e := (c - b)/2; a := a + e; d := d - e; c := a - c; b := b - d;
And with that, we have a fast, reversible 2x2 WHT with unit scaling, the minimum possible range expansion (doubled), and no multiplies. It has one other useful quirk— it's its own bit-exact reverse. We don't even need to implement an inverted version. And, of course, we can use this exact same filter implementation to split blocks as well as merge them.
Note that this is not the only possible implementation. We can shuffle the asymmetries and sequence of operations to implement versions with slightly different integer rounding behavior. The implementation shown here matches the Daala source as of August 2, 2013. We submitted this WHT plus a few variants to Google for use in VP9's lossless coding mode; they chose one of the alternate versions of the WHT illustrated above.
An Approximate Reckoning
TF as we've implemented above is a very-cheap-to-compute approximation of the transform we were actually aiming for: a true DCT of the alternate blocksize. How good is this approximation?
Let's use something easy to see: transformed basis functions. We start with a grid of 4x4 blocks, with alternating blocks containing one of the 4x4 DCT basis functions. We transform each block into the frequency domain with a 4x4 DCT. The output blocks contain a single non-zero frequency coefficient each, confirmation that our inputs are basis functions. This is the ideal 4x4 output that we'll compare to 4x4 blocks we manufacture using TF splitting.
Now we start with the same input values, but grouped together into larger 8x8 blocks. We transform them to the frequency domain using 8x8 DCTs; note that the frequency domain looks quite different:
Finally we split each 8x8 frequency domain block into four 4x4 blocks using TF. Compare the 4x4 TF output to the output produced directly by the 4x4 DCT (two diagrams above).
Let's also compare TF merging using a similar process. We begin this time with the 8x8 DCT basis functions, so that our ideal 8x8 frequency-domain blocks contain one nonzero frequency coefficient each. Skipping straight to the results:
Neither the split nor the merge are that bad of an approximation for such a cheap transform... but we notice something in the TF-merge results. There's an obvious pattern to the output error that's partly position-invariant with respect to the nonzero coefficient.
Earlier, I said that different DCT transform sizes differ in the number of stages at the beginning (not end) of the transform, and so there's no way to alter the transformed blocksize of a DCT without first completely undoing the DCT. That's not quite true; we can change the blocksize of a DCT after the fact, but it theoretically requires N^2 operations. Completely recomputing the DCT is cheaper.
However, the error pattern in the TF-merged output suggests we can improve our cheap approximation, and in fact we can. A simple secondary lifting filter applied to the rows and then columns of the initial TF output block improves the mean squared error by more than an order of magnitude:
We build a two-stage TF split transform as expected; use the inverse of the second stage filter as a prefilter to the one-stage splitting transform. The additional filter stage improves splitting as much as it improves merging.
We can continue improving the filter to come arbitrarily close to the exact DCT output if we want. For example, six additional add/shift operations can further reduce output error by half. However, the cost of larger filters yields steeply diminishing returns.
We've spent this whole time looking at transformed basis functions, mainly because the sparse frequency domain makes error very easy to see. Below, we see TF merge/split used as an approximation to the DCT, as applied to a real image. This is only a single image example, but the results are representative of general behavior.
Where we go from here
There's a glaring 'error' in all of the above TF work: we've been modeling performance of the DCT, not our lapped transform. Single-stage TF using a WHT is a rough enough approximation that lapped or not makes relatively little difference. However, the second TF stage dramatically improves results, and it's possible that it could be (and should be) tuned to our lapped transform rather than the DCT.
We also shouldn't forget that TF isn't just low-cost, it's a reversible transform. Our new-and-improved TF, or a variant of it, may show sufficient coding gain that we could potentially use it to replace larger DCT blocksizes entirely. In one possible scenario, we'd transform everything as a 4x4 lapped transform and build larger blocksizes from TF. That would increase speed and solve all our various heterogeneous blocksize problems-- if it actually works.
Call that future research for now.
There's also still quite a bit to cover in the overall Daala design. Next demo, I think we'll look at another place we use TF: Predicting the Chroma planes from the Luma plane (page now up!).

Human hair could be used instead of chemical fertilizers for some plants like lettuce, new research in a horticultural journal suggests.
The hair, which is manufactured into cubes from barbershop and hair-salon waste, provides nitrogen for plants as it decomposes, just as natural-gas-derived sources like ammonia do.
"Once the degradation and mineralization of hair waste starts, it can provide sufficient nutrients to container-grown plants and ensure similar yields to those obtained with the commonly used fertilizers in horticulture," said horticulturalist Vlatcho Zheljazkov of Mississippi State University.
All plants need nitrogen to grow. These plants form the basis of the proteins which eventually make their way into our bodies either directly through the consumption either of the plants themselves or of animals raised on plants. Our bodies turn those proteins into all sorts of useful things — like muscles — and some less useful things, like hair. In fact, studies carried out in the 1960s found that human hair contains about 15 percent nitrogen [pdf].
Nitrogen is ridiculously abundant. It composes about 75 percent of the atmosphere, but plants can't use it in its inert atmospheric form.
Luckily, some microbes that grow with legumes pull this N2 out of the air and "fix it" into the reactive nitrogen that all living things use.
Until the development of the Haber-Bosch process for cooking natural gas with more natural gas into nitrogen-rich ammonia, humans depended entirely on these microbes for the production of nitrogen. We either rotated other crops with legumes or used the nitrogen left over from animal digestion as manure.
The last 50 years, however, have seen enormous increases in the use of synthetic fertilizers using ammonia from the Haber-Bosch process. Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba, one of the world's foremost experts on energy, estimates that 40 percent of the human population owes its existence [pdf] to synthetic fertilizers.
But all that nitrogen takes a lot of energy to produce. Smil has also estimated that the Haber-Bosch process uses about 1 percent of the world's total energy usage [xls], or about 150 gigawatts. That's about as much coal power as the UNited States plans to add between now and 2030, so low-energy alternatives to traditional chemical fertilizers could help reduce energy usage.
The new study, published in HortTechnology, shows that both lettuce and wormwood, the psychoactive ingredient in absinthe, grow about as well with hair as a fertilizer as they do with chemical fertilizers. The plants seem to be able to use about 50 percent of the nitrogen contained in the hair.
The only catch is that the hair takes a while to start decomposing and releasing nutrients into the soil, so it has to be paired with more fast-acting fertilizers.
(And that some people might find decomposing hair fertilizing their salad greens a little gross.)

New OpenRISC: academic work helps open source hardware
OpenCores delivered a new version of OpenRISC, an open source processor hosted together with many open source hardware projects; more information on their current news page.
What is special about this version is that the major driver for the code development has been an academic thesis on verification. Waqas Ahmed of the Royal Institute of Technology published a dissertation on some functional and formal methods for hardware verification, using an OpenRISC1200 architecture as the system under test. The experiments led to the discovery of many bugs and errors that have been promptly corrected in this version of the core.
Linus' law states that “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”. This has not been the case for open source hardware yet, because of the low number of developers (and users) involved with respect to the open source software world. While the software ecosystem thrives on large number of developers, the hardware one needs quality above all, for many reasons. One specific example comes to mind these days:
When the operating system of a phone is buggy, the problem can be solved with the small cost of a remote update.
When the antenna of a phone is faulty (for example it receives poorly if held with your left hand), you can see the effects in the news.
The quality of the contribution to open source hardware projects must be kept high. Another example is Aeroflex Gaisler that provides open source cores (the LEON series) and IPs. They enforce good code practices and are able to create space-grade products that are used in applications where an error can blow up millions of dollars.
What happened with OpenRISC is that the project benefited from its open nature while giving the academic world an opportunity for growth and education. The quality of the academic contribution is very high, and from another point of view the learning challenge that a complex system such as OpenRISC offers to students is appealing.
Once the universities around the world start to invest on open source hardware to the point that they improve hardware quality and performance to the level of commercial products, then the industry will have a cheap alternative to the now very expensive (but reliable and cutting-edge) IP portfolio offered by the major houses.
The full document of OpenRISC verification is available for OpenCores users on the download page; the process involves both SystemC and SystemVerilog, and is based on the Open Verification Methodology (OVM).

Since the election, the antitrust community has debated the question of how antitrust enforcement under the Trump administration might differ from that of the past administration.
Some have predicted a transition to a less-interventionist approach, in line, generally, with the posture of past Republican administrations.
ADVERTISEMENT
But others have pointed to statements and actions by President Trump as evidence that his administration might pursue a different path and incorporate some of the more populist themes he communicated on the campaign trail into his antitrust enforcement.
Candidate Trump, for instance, stated that Amazon has “a huge antitrust problem” and that he would seek to block AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner because it would create “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”
Since his election, the president reportedly met with executives of companies contemplating mergers or with mergers under review by the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission, including a meeting a few days before his inauguration with the CEOs of Bayer and Monsanto.
After the meeting, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced a commitment by Bayer, if its proposed acquisition of Monsanto is approved, to add thousands of new jobs and to significantly increase its investment in the United States.
This raises the question of whether job numbers will become a factor the new administration's DOJ or FTC will consider when it reviews mergers.
A populist antitrust policy that regards large size as necessarily bad, or that promotes policies and interests other than vigorous competition, would represent a significant departure from the policies of prior administrations — both Republican and Democrat.
For decades, antitrust enforcement has sought to protect the competitive process and promote efficiency and consumer welfare. Invitations to consider other interests, such as the impact of a proposed merger on jobs or the environment, have been ignored.
Employees of U.S. Airways and American Airlines, for example, publicly urged the Obama administration's DOJ to approve a proposed airline merger in 2013 because the airlines promised the employees significantly higher wages.
In spite of these pleas, the DOJ sued to block the merger because of its likely effect on airfares.
Courts also agree that prices, output, and innovation are the only appropriate considerations in antitrust cases. They reject even the most well-intentioned efforts to advance other important interests as defenses for anticompetitive activities.
In one famous case, the Supreme Court considered a trade association policy that prohibited engineers from discussing their prices when soliciting work.
This was a policy the engineers said was needed to protect public health and safety because engineers seeking to win projects by competing on price might perform dangerously low-quality work.
The Supreme Court recognized this policy for what it was — a ban on a key element of competition among engineers — and characterized the attempt to prioritize protecting public safety over competition as “nothing less than a frontal assault on the basic policy of the Sherman Act.”
In another case, the Supreme Court refused to consider the good intentions of major oil companies that stockpiled oil during the Great Depression to increase prices and create jobs in oil production, condemning their conduct as illegal price-fixing.
But even if courts might be unwilling to consider factors other than the impact that a challenged merger or alleged anticompetitive practice might have on competition, nothing can stop the Trump administration's antitrust enforcers from considering other policies and interests as they evaluate whether to bring a matter to court.
It remains to be seen whether they will pursue a cautious but conventional approach, like the DOJ and FTC under previous Republican presidents, or one with more populist goals in mind.
Maureen Ohlhausen, recently tapped by President Trump to be acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, might have previewed the new administration's direction when she expressed at a recent conference concern about “importing other values” into antitrust law.
Only further appointments, investigations, and lawsuits will reveal whether this clue reflects reality.

The bends are decompression sickness, resulting from a rapid ascent from depth; tiny bubbles materialize inside a diver's body from the solution of dissolved gases under pressure. It's accompanied by aches, fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, and can result in paralysis or death. And it's a name that perfectly captures the sound of Radiohead's second incomparable studio album, which turned twenty on March 13th. In honor of that anniversary, I'll be returning to this masterpiece, track by track.
1993's Pablo Honey proved a mixed blessing for the band. The critical reception was lukewarm, with most reviewers drawing parallels to other 90s grunge scene, dubbing Radiohead the British “corporate-funded Nirvana-lite.” I remember seeing “Creep” on the Beavis and Butthead show when I was in my early teens, and recall the imbecilic duo debating the merits of the song:
Butthead: ‘It better start rocking or I'll really give him something to cry about.'
Beavis: ‘Shut up Butthead, it's cool. Check it out, check it out! Here it comes…'
At that moment, the Johnny Greenwood's guitar bursts forth in an exclamation of mopey clamor, those famous three distorted dead notes that capture the self-laceration of an unrequited love. Though initially something of a dud, the merits of those hazy guitars earned “Creep” a re-release as a single, and eventually catapulted the band into the international spotlight. “I wish I was special,” singer Thom Yorke's laments. In retrospect, one might have muttered the old adage about being careful what you wish for.
Radiohead's preliminary ambivalence with success was already present on Pablo Honey on tracks like “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” and the following single “Pop Is Dead.” Lyrics like “Pop is dead… it died an ugly death from back catalogue” reveal a growing dissatisfaction with the current state of rock and roll, but the articulation of that frustration remained too direct, too much a product of its beflanneled times. The promise of the band remained nascent, and few might have guessed what they were to evolve into.
And that's why The Bends is arguably the most important Radiohead album. It's still grungy, it's still driven by driving guitars, but it presages what the band is to one day become. The suddenness with which they were thrown into the limelight, and the violent discontent which followed provides the substrate from which the band would arise to develop their distinct dedication to pop experimentation. When investigating the Radiohead archive, one can delineate their progression from grunge mopesters to pop avant gardists.
Pablo Honey's straightforward foray into the scene yields unintended consequences. The Bends articulate that experience uncertainty (“Where do we go from here?”), but also proffers an answer – “Immerse your soul in love.” And Radiohead does just that, returning to plumb the depths of the musical experimentation they love again, this time without fear of the pains of decompression. Later, OK Computer appears as a renewal of this ethos. The opening track “Airbag” contains the lines, “I am born again… in an interstellar burst/I am back to save the universe.” The dread is still there, but it's lined with hope. That hope pushes the band to further investigation and elaboration of itself, which is revealed in Kid A, Amnesiac, and so on.
“Planet Telex” sets the tone immediately. An ethereal zephyr blows in as Yorke declares that, “You can force it, but it will not come,” and reminds us that “everything is still broken.” The elegiac howl of his otherworldly voice unfurls, describing the ennui not only of his condition, but that of every teenager and college student in the mid-nineties. Upon listening again, I'm transported to the uncomfortable couch in my shitty basement apartment in Washington, DC, bemoaning a recent breakup (Anyone who hasn't sat in a dark room and brooded to a Radiohead album is not to be trusted, like someone who can dance sober). Simultaneously, I'm taken to a college party, arguing the merits of “Black Star” with a tall drunk guy with mutton chops. It's the unmistakable mark of a great album: it carries the spark that flashes between the moment you're listening to it and prior associated moments. It's a wormhole through time, conjuring up memories and sensations long dormant, binding you both to who you are and who you once were. “Why can't you forget?” That's simple enough to answer: this album is really fucking great right off the bat, even if everything is broken.
Onward, to the title track. Here, we wallow in the alienation of the postmodern condition. The tinkling-glass windchime effect in the opening ten seconds, followed by the muffled injunction to “Bring it up!” always primes me for that opening guitar detonation. Yorke's wordless yowl brings everything home, before he launches into a parade of misery-laden lyrics. I'm tempted to reproduce the lines in their entirety here, but anyone reads this probably knows the anxiety described in that song. Still, there's that plea for hope from the bottom of that blackest of depression wells: “I wanna live, breathe/I wanna be part of the human race.” The song structure is tremendous as well, a clever variation on the loud-quiet-loud arrangement popularized by Yorke's beloved Pixies. The spasmic outburst expressing that desire to live is muted, though, by the recollection of the uncertainty expressed in those first lines. The effect is haunting.
“High and Dry” provides an acoustically textured contrast to its predecessor's energy while extending the same shuddering, despaired conclusion. Again, the lyrics are drenched in bitterness, and one wonders if the bits about having to “kill yourself for recognition” and “turning into something you are not” are references to the contortions Radiohead had put themselves through in years prior. It's a gentle breakdown of a song, a submissive requiem to the loss of “the best thing that you've ever had.” The accompanying video always struck me as an odd mishmash, though. The Technicolor melancholy of the diner patrons is appropriate visual complement, but the Pulp Fiction bank robber subplot seemed out of place. I imagine some executive at EMI insisting that the video have an exploding car, lest valuable adrenaline-seeking demographics withdraw their support for the band.
Speaking of videos, the one for “Fake Plastic Trees” is among the saddest and weirdest ever produced. According to legend, Radiohead had a dreadful time recording the song. Yorke had recently seen Jeff Buckley perform, and, after a frustrating day at the studio, Yorke punched in a few takes of the song alone. Afterward, Johnny Greenwood reported that when the band returned, Thom burst into tears. Moreover, this song displays the band's early rebuke of consumerism. “She looks like the real thing/she tastes like the real thing” is a sly nod to the empty calories of our Coca-Cola world, and the supermarket setting of the video cements their capitalist critique. For years, I was convinced that the song was somehow influenced by Milan Kundera's Unbearable Lightness of Being, believing that the stanzas “he used to do surgery/for girls in the eighties/but gravity always wins” were clear references to the protagonist Tomáš from the novel. I'm undoubtedly wrong, but I feel it illustrates how great music and great literature interweave, spill over, and inform our experiences, to become part of our subconscious landscapes.
“Bones” and “(Nice Dream)” never became hits, but they're part of the emotional core of the album. “I used to fly like Peter Pan” is as honest a characterization of depression I've heard, and “(Nice Dream)” provides a pleasant intermission from all the downhearted turbulence. Neither would be possible without Yorke's tortured falsetto. Although it's been imitated to death since, it's important to recall that this was 1995. Coolio (who is a Juggalo now) topped the charts. Our poor ears were being subjected to Bush and Hootie and the Blowfish. Van Halen's “Can't Stop Lovin' You” was on the radio, for fuck's sake. There wasn't a more timely remedy to this 90s end-of-history malaise than The Bends.
Ah, “Just.” That churning crunch of Greenwood's guitar provides a soupçon of the rocking clamor of Radiohead's prior incarnation. The fret-flying furor is mirrored by Thom's lock-elbowed spasms as he croons like a mescaline vision of Jeff Buckley. The video is another thrilling depiction of wretchedness, the revelation of a secret so debilitating that renders all who hear it paralyzed with despondency. It's like a Jorge Luis Borges short story, but one scrabbled by the tangles of Greenwood's sweltering guitar solo.
We come now to the most caustic song on the album, “My Iron Lung,” a self-reflexive examination of how the success of “Creep” had circumscribed the band while simultaneously sustaining them. Radiohead sonically destroys the cumbersome apparatus of their achievements before moving on to “Bullet Proof… I Wish I Was.” Indications of their future development are again present here, the song more akin to OK Computer than anything else on The Bends. “Black Star” and “Sulk” round the album out with more isolated weirdness, reinforcing our collective tragedy in a resigned one-two punch. “Blame it on this sad life that brings me home” could be the thesis statement of the entire album, echoing Faulkner's quotation, “Given the choice between the experience of pain and nothing, I would choose pain.”
The album closes with “Street Spirit (Fade Out),” which Yorke described as “one of [the band's] the saddest songs” and a “dark tunnel without the light at the end.” The arpeggiated A minor is the perfect haunting coda for the entire effort, dystopian psychedelic perfection. There's an uneasy tension in its beauty, and one that won't be resolved entirely until OK Computer, but listening to it again, I found myself drifting away. The sensation is comparable to the desperate need to sleep after a traumatic day, lying on a bed after the funeral of a loved one.
The Bends are an undisputed masterpiece. We find a band in command of their talents, but only just beginning to explore the horizons available to them. We have scope, vision, execution, and energy, all in contradistinction to the sounds of the day. 1995 gave us a lot to love – Pulps' Different Class, Smashing Pumpkin's “1979,” Return to the 36 Chambers and Liquid Swords, Wowee Zowee and Washing Machine (it also gave us Mariah Carey and Michael Bolton). Still, nothing bubbles up in your blood quite like The Bends, and you'll cherish the dull ache it leaves as a reminder that, despite what you've endured, you're still very much alive.

: The Panegyricus in the Roman World Paul Roche Cambridge University Press , 26 may. 2011 0 Reseñas Pliny's Panegyricus (AD 100) survives as a unique example of senatorial rhetoric from the early Roman Empire. It offers an eyewitness account of the last years of Domitian's principate, the reign of Nerva and Trajan's early years, and it communicates a detailed senatorial view on the behaviour expected of an emperor. It is an important document in the development of the ideals of imperial leadership, but it also contributes greatly to our understanding of imperial political culture more generally. This volume, the first ever devoted to the Panegyricus, contains expert studies of its key historical and rhetorical contexts, as well as important critical approaches to the published version of the speech and its influence in antiquity. It offers scholars of Roman history, literature and rhetoric an up-to-date overview of key approaches to the speech, and students and interested readers an authoritative introduction to this vital and under-appreciated speech.

Two bodies were found Thursday afternoon in suitcases on a road in the town of Geneva. VIDEO: Bodies found in town of GenevaPolice Chief Steven Hurley said a highway employee discovered two suitcases in long grass while he was mowing along North Como Road near County Road H Thursday afternoon. The employee moved the suitcases to the side of the road.Police were called around 3 p.m. after a citizen reported the suitcases along the side of the road.Responding officers opened the suitcases and discovered two bodies, one in each suitcase.The chief said there appeared to be one body in each suitcase, but wouldn't comment on the condition of the remains or describe the size of the suitcases. He said it doesn't appear the victims were killed at the location where the suitcases were found. The ditch runs along a rural road about a quarter mile from the town's police station, but the area is remote and surrounded by rolling corn fields.It's "very abnormal," Hurley said. "It's a very quiet town, a close-knit town. Everybody knows everybody else."The Waukesha County Medical Examiner's Office was conducting autopsies Friday. The Walworth County Sheriff's Department and the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation were assisting town police. Investigators also were checking with other law enforcement agencies across the country for reports of missing people.The gruesome discovery left the town of about 4,000 on the shores of Lake Como shaken.Jim Daily, 70, owns a hay and horse farm about half a mile from where the suitcases were discovered. He came home Thursday afternoon to find the road barricaded by police. All officers would tell him was that no one was in danger, he said. He later learned about the bodies from news outlets.Daily said the grass was tall around the ditch, so he had no idea how long the suitcases might have been there."I don't remember seeing anybody stopped or parked. We were as surprised as anybody else. It was a shock to all of us. You don't like finding corpses in your neighborhood," he said Friday.Jessica Finster, 29, tends bar at the Como Inn about a mile from the where the suitcases were found. She said the discovery is particularly frightening because she closes the bar three nights a week by herself."That's what scares me. There are bodies in suitcases right down the street from where I work," she said. "It's kind of creepy. It's like 'CSI.' But that doesn't happen around here. I've never heard of someone in a suitcase left on the side of the road except in a fictional story."Alysia Olcott, 19, said she had just moved two months ago to a house near the road where the bodies were found. She said she and her boyfriend were so worried Thursday night they took the unusual step of locking their windows."I feel very uncomfortable," she said. "I thought this was a nice little area. I never thought it would happen here," she said. "Was this a crime committed further away or was it (committed) close to home? It's pretty disturbing."Olcott's grandmother, 59-year-old Marti Todd, was tending the bar at the In The Drink bar on Lake Como's southwestern shore. She said she didn't think someone from the area would be bold enough to dump bodies down the road from the police station."I can't believe someone from our community is capable of it," Todd said. "It's brazen."Anyone with additional information is asked to call the town of Geneva police department at 262-248-9926. Anonymous tips can be called in to CrimeStoppers at 262-723-2677.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Political activist Laura Schmidt has created the “Good Grief” support group, to help depressed eco-activists work through their climate grief.
Sad about climate change? There's a support group for that.
A new program, reflecting lessons from Alcoholics Anonymous, aims to help people work through their grief about climate change. The first step: Admit we have a problem.
…
The gathering is the brainchild of Laura Schmidt, who described the meeting in a recent Skype interview. Schmidt's day job at HEAL Utah is to rally others to support clean air legislation in the state. By night, she's been organizing this monthly “Good Grief” group, which focuses on working through heavy feelings about difficult societal problems, especially climate change.
There's no clinical definition for “climate grief,” but for Schmidt, “It's that feeling at the pit of your stomach when you realize that people – probably even the ones we love – and wildlife will suffer as the impacts of climate change become more prevalent. It's the ache we feel when we see how non-existent or slow ‘progress' to combat warming is.”
…
A master plan to cope with climate grief
Two years ago, while pursuing a master's degree in environmental humanities at the University of Utah, Schmidt set out to answer a question: “How do we create resilient humans?” She says she wanted to understand how people could become better able to keep up the difficult fight to address climate change.
To answer her question, she interviewed people who spend a lot of time focused on the subject, such as climate scientists and activists. She says she hoped to find out what sustains those people in what can seem like an uphill battle.
Through conversations with the likes of author-activist Terry Tempest Williams and 350.org founder Bill McKibben, Schmidt says she discovered clear themes. The people she spoke with seemed unafraid to say they felt sad or mad or angry. They also drew strength and joy from a strong connection to the natural world. And they had a community they turned to for support.
“When things got really depressing for them, they could take a break and let their community care for them a little bit – and then go back out and fight or talk about climate change,” she says.
…
8. Look for beauty and meaning. Some stories from the Holocaust suggest that finding even the smallest examples of beauty, like a tiny flower in otherwise barren earth, can give people something to hold on to, even through horror, Schmidt says. She points to science that suggests different parts of the brain are responsible for triggering different responses: the reptilian part of the brain, which causes flight-or-fight fear responses, or the mammalian brain, which is what urges us to look more deeply at any given situation. “What's cool about brain science,” she says, “is that with practices like meditation, we get to choose what part of our brain responds to these threats.”

Mailbox updated their iOS app to add support for Yahoo and iCloud (Me.com and Mac.com). This is by far the most significant update we've seen from the email syncing service since the debut of their app. Mailbox launched their app with support for gmail only, but now that the company has been acquired by Dropbox, it has access to a wider range of resources and has used them wisely to expand its supported emailing services.
Mailbox was amongst one of the first apps to promote the idea that every email requires an action, be it to archive, delete, postpone or list. While these features may seem basic, they require a tremendous amount of background server operations. This is due to the fact that Mailbox relies on its cloud service to carry out its tasks.
Think of all the emails that you receive everyday! Now think about the number of people who are using the service (1 million as of March 2013)! Now think about how fast the email are delivered to your inbox via Mailbox. Every single details of these operations requires backbone processing power.
At its early days, the company had to be very selective about which emailing service to support first. They had to take into consideration the ease of API integrations, and user demand (Purely business). Gmail obviously won that war. Now that the company is settled in at Dropbox and has more money and resources to play with, they're listening to user demands and adding more email providers to their list. Although there is still not Android app.
While this is a big step forward for Mailbox in reaching out to a wider audience, it will never be a truly versatile service without support of POP and IMAP. While I use Gmail to email friends and family, I rely heavily on POP and IMAP for work and blog. I absolutely love Mailbox, but I think it's such a shame that I have to keep going back to the stock iOS Mail app to check my work email.
The fact that the company has added support for two additional clients, it shows us that they are comfortable with the client (UI & UX) and server end (push, fetch, etc…) operations. Based on that, I'm sure we'll be getting support for other mailing services and even the precious POP and IMAP. I realise this is a bit far fetched and way into the future, but I wouldn't mind replacing my desktop mail app with Mailbox. But I'm sure Android gets first dibs at an app.

I know things are looking stale on the Gridcoin development side, but we have been working to add stability to the wallet and are now in the final test phase of Gridcoin 3.7.0.0 which will be a mandatory upgrade. There is no set release date yet other than as there are two more changes I want to include and test to further improve the forking situation when reorganizing. When released we will set a V9 trigger height roughly 2 weeks beyond release date to give exchanges time to react. After that the fork fixes will kick in and we can start removing the obsolete tally code.
While there are many, many more features and fixes done, I will try to cover some of the larger ones. Please see closed github pull requests for a hard to read but complete list.
TL;DR:
The chain should now fork less often.
Windows clients will hopefully freeze less.
Nodes should sync faster.
The wallet should use a little less CPU.
Fork improvements
We have had a lot of problems with wallets disagreeing on rewards and taking different routes on the chain. That is, different forks. We believe that the reason for this is that wallets have different views on how much each user is owed due to the way the nodes collect historical rewards and magnitudes. V9 blocks introduced in version 3.7.0.0 change this with two important fixes:
Rewards are now validated when connecting the block to the chain instead of when the block is received to avoid future blocks not matching tallies.
Reward tallies are now done in a more deterministic and synchronized way whereas it previously was initially done in sync but was easily disturbed.
These changes solve two very fork happy and hard to debug issues. The caveat is that it may not solve all fork issues, just the ones we have managed to track down.
Improved syncing
Gridcoin has a mechanism which allows clients to request blocks in bursts to improve the synchronization speed. Roughly speaking, the nodes sending block metadata will save information about the last block information sent to the syncing node, making that block a sentry. Whenever the syncing client requests the sentry block another burst of block metadata is sent along with it.
This repeats until the the syncer stops requesting blocks or until the node does not have any more blocks to send. Note: Image is not entirely true as the communication is done with hashes, not heights. The basic flow still applies.
A while ago this block burst size was changed from 500 to 1000 blocks which caused the burst size to exceed the maximum allowed transmission size, so the syncing node never got information about the sentry block. You would see that as hickups in the chain synchronization. Your node would receive a burst of blocks, pause for a long time, receive the next burst and so on. The pause bug is fixed and the pauses are now only when the remote end loads its blocks from disk.
Deadlocks
This is going to be a bit technical but I'll try to explain it as well as I can.
In computer programming it is often beneficial to do things in parallel to avoid making the program feel sluggish. For example, you do not want the user interface to freeze while the program is processing a burst of received blocks. The easiest way to solve this is to use
threads. This also has the benefit of utilizing more cores on the CPU. However, using threads is not free.
Since there are now multiple data produces and consumers you have to make sure that they are not manipulating data simultaneously. The way you solve this is by using locks.
Each thread which wants to read or write shared data will have to wait for a lock to be released before they can acquire it themselves. One single lock won't bring down a software on its own. The devious behavior come when you have multiple locks and aquire the locks in different order.
In Gridcoin we use a lot of locks for protecting various different resources. In one recent issue two particular locks, cs_Main and cs_vSend were involved in threads aquiring them in different order. Even though there is a very small risk that the threads deadlock, the order has now been changed so the deadlock problem in this case is eliminated.
If we are right about this deadlock it would explain why Windows wallets are more prone to running into this issue than Linux wallets. The reason is that Windows wallets hold the cs_Main lock while performing NeuralNet operations before they also take the cs_vSend lock. Since the NeuralNet operation can take several seconds they are way more likely to deadlock. The way this manifests itself is a user interface freeze.
Note that since we have not been able to reproduce the Windows freezes in a debugger it is very likely that the problem remains. Only time will tell. Threading and locks are tricky business at this source magnitude so we cannot assure that all the deadlocks are gone, but it should at least be better now.
Crashes
Windows users have been plagued with silent shutdowns for a while now. We tracked down a very likely cause to where the NeuralNet started scraping the BOINC statistics data while a scaping operation was already in progress. The first thing the scraper does is to delete the currently downloaded statistic files. In this case the files were obliterated right under the feet of the first scrape operation, casuing it to lay down and die. We now block concurrent stat syncing and gracefully handle file I/O errors.
There is also an included fix for an issue which caused the wallet to crash when the user issued a backup from the menu.
Performance improvements
A lot has been done to improve the overall performance of the wallet. Existing code has been tweaked and optimized while some obsolete code has been removed, opening up for further improvements.
Data structures
Following changes in the Bitcoin base we have changed the underlying data structure holding blocks to a more efficient one. This will consume around 1-1.5% more memory but every time we access a block in the existing chain we save a good amount of CPU cycles. This will especially affect chain loading but the improvement ripples throughout the entire code base.
To put some numbers to it, after syncing the chain on a Raspberry Pi 3 the old implementation spent 46% of the total execution time querying the chain for blocks. This is now down to 13%.
Checkpoints
We previously had mechanisms for relaying checkpoints between nodes. This was not needed as checkpoints are hard coded in the client, something that is good enough for its purpose. By removing the relaying we could greatly simplify the checkpoint validations which will cause the nodes to use a lot less CPU when processing blocks. This is especially noticeble when synchronizing the chain, something which should be a lot faster now.
String conversions
The code responsible for converting floating point values to and from strings has been greatly simplified and gained a large performance boost. As in the previous sync test on the Pi3, we did 22 million calls to cdbl (round a double contained in a string), spending 18% of the total execution time. Unfortunately I didn't keep the aftermath numbers, but it is much, much better now.
Post 3.7.0.0
Many of you are probably wondering where the heck the rebranding changes have gone. Don't worry, we intentinally postponed the UI changes in favor of focusing on only the stability. The rebranding will be done in 3.7.1.0 as a leisure update.
Mosque Director Remembers SB Shooter as 'Quiet and Peaceful'
PHOTOS, VIDEO: Inside the Home of the San Bernardino Terrorists
A man who shielded a coworker as a final act before he died in Wednesday's terror attack in San Bernardino is being hailed as a hero.
27-year-old Denise Peraza said Shannon Johnson, 45, wrapped his arm around his younger coworker, said "I got you," and saved her life.
Peraza shared the story of her survival and paid tribute to Johnson, whom she called an "amazing" and "selfless" man:
This is Shannon Johnson. Wednesday morning at 10:55 am we were seated next to each other at a table, joking about how we thought the large clock on the wall might be broken because time seemed to be moving so slowly. I would have never guessed that only 5 minutes later, we would be huddled next to each other under that same table, using a fallen chair as a shield from over 60 rounds of bullets being fired across the room. While I cannot recall every single second that played out that morning, I will always remember his left arm wrapped around me, holding me as close as possible next to him behind that chair. And amidst all the chaos, I'll always remember him saying these three words, “I got you.” I believe I am still here today because of this amazing man. This amazing, selfless man who always brought a smile to everyone's face in the office with his lively stories about his hometown back in Georgia. Who will be deeply missed by all. This is Shannon Johnson. My friend, my hero.
Johnson was a Georgia native who drove 18-wheelers cross-country for a living until he went to college and graduated, the station reported. Ten years ago he got a job with the San Bernardino County Public Health Department.
Peraza's sister, Stephanie Rose Baldwin, also praised Johnson on her Facebook page.
"This angel of a man was sitting next to my sister when the shooting happened,” Baldwin wrote. “He helped protect her from the bullets and we are so grateful for his heroic love, that most likely saved her life. She said he was a very sweet man and she spoke with him often at work. Our heart breaks hearing of his passing, and it bursts knowing of his love for my sister."
A GoFundMe page was set up to pay the costs of Johnson's burial. On the page it says that Johnson's girlfriend wants to make it explicit that all leftover proceeds would be used to spread his message of "I Got You."

CAIR Director: U.S. 'Partly Responsible' for Islamic Terrorism
Paul: Concealed Carry Lets Potential Attackers Know We Will Defend Ourselves
One of the victims of the San Bernardino massacre was an Iranian Roman Catholic who had fled Iran in 1987 to “escape Islamic extremism and the persecution of Christians that followed the Iranian Revolution,” according to a statement released by her family.
Bennetta Betbadal, 46, was among 14 people killed on Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino by terrorists Syed Farook and his wife. The San Bernardino Sun reported that Betbadal (third from left, above) left Iran at the age of 18, first living in New York City and then relocating to California, where she married her husband, Arlen Verdehyou, in 1997. Verdehyou served as a police officer at Riverside Community College.
The couple moved to Rialto; at her death Betbadal left behind a daughter, 15, and two sons, 12 and 10.
Betbadal obtained a degree in chemistry from Cal Poly Pomona and also had a bachelor of science degree in biotechnology, later joining the San Bernardino County Health Department in 2006 as an inspector.
As a devout Catholic, in 2009 Betbadal posted a Facebook note to Ashur Bet Sargis, an Assyrian pop singer: “My dearest Ashur, I thank God for creating you, for creating such a wonderful loving human, and for giving you such a great talent. May our Lord Jesus be with you all the days of your life.”
Betbadal's family released a statement on a GoFundMe page they that stated, “It is the ultimate irony that her life would be stolen from her that day by what appears to be the same type of extremism that she fled so many years ago.”
Some are calling Betbadal's murder an example of the genocide of Christians extending beyond the Middle East.
“With Ms. Bennetta Betbadal's death during the California terrorist attacks I am not sure how [House Foreign Affairs Committee] can avoid calling the death of [C]hristians down range a non genocide issue,” one activist said via email.
What is Self Bondage?
It is best described as putting yourself in bondage alone for a period of time; until you either release yourself or have someone else do it for you. However typically most self bondage is self release and controlled by the participant. It can also be used in conjunction with other forms of solo sex play. The practice is much more common than you would think it is practiced by both males and females of different ages, backgrounds, ethnicity and sexual orientations. According to a 2005 survey by Durex, 36 percent of adults in the United States have either experienced or participated regularly in sex involving bondage, with other studies putting this number than high as 60 percent. Thus it is safe to assume that at least some of this percentage have engaged in self bondage at some time.
Why is Self Bondage Practiced ?
Without getting too into the psychological reasons behind our appetite for bondage, it is safe to say it can make sex much more exciting and intense. The motivation behind why someone would want to engage in self bondage can be varied. There are however a number of more practical reasons why you would choose self bondage opposed to playing with a partner or group. The first would have to be the stigma that is sadly still attached to bondage, which is still present despite its mainstream acceptance of late. Often people are afraid to upset partners or face prejudice from other acquaintances who do not share the same desires. Thus they want to keep their bondage play a secret. Apart from that, some feel that self-bondage provides a safer and gentler way to explore their own bondage fantasies without pressure from other people.
It can also be said that private secret nature of self bondage can be part of its allure. The planning can enhance the self bondage session acting as a sort of foreplay greatly increasing the sexual high that can be experienced from bondage. Some people can literally taste the feel that self bondage gives them as their body begins to react to the thoughts and feelings associated with their preparations.
Where and when?
Start out by planning where you want to have your session. The where really depend on how long and intricate you what to make your self bondage. Generally, you what to use a place that is private and you will not be disturbed. So at home in your bedroom is normally a pretty good place to start, but cars, boats, offices, hotel rooms and secluded wilderness areas can work. You may want to start by taking the phone off the hook, locking your front door, putting the cat out and making sure your not going to have any visitors.
It may also be a good idea to put some time into setting the scene for your self-bondage session. putting on some erotic music, turning off the lights, lighting some candles and even lowering room temperature can add a more dungeon type feel. Other more involved ideas like using black plastic sheeting to cover furniture such as a bed of chair, installing i bolts in walls as contact points, purchase bondage specific furniture can all add to your experience.
A final thing on where is you should also consider your safety and always have an escape plan in case of an emergency. you don't what to be a nominee for the Darwin awards.
When is not so important, but generally if you what a time that you're not going to be disturbed, at night works best for most people. One idea is to use your bedtime as a time to experiment with some light bondage. you could start by lightly restraining yourself or wear so constrictive latex to bed; either for part or all of the night.
How do I Practice Self Bondage?
With self bondage you typically what to start with the end in mind, how are you going to get out of your bondage? This can be done one of three ways the first is to restrain parts of your body but leave your hands free. An example of this is breast bondage where you wrap a soft rope around your chest giving you a feeling of restraint while still having complete movement. There is a myriad of different techniques you can use to bond your various body parts such as your feet, legs, between your legs, torso, and arms. Have a look through the rest of this site as well as the web for knot tying inspiration. The great thing about this option is that you have your hands free to torment and play with yourself. A good way to also get started is with a bondage kit. They generally include rope, straps and cuffs specially designed for the purpose, which can make your first time and subsequent times more enjoyable. Also a word of warning although this is light bondage you should be careful and stop if you start to feel any pain or loss of feeling. Having a pair of safety scissors close at hand is also smart.
The second more heavy approach to self bondage is with the use of locks. In this type of self bondage you put yourself in full bondage and have to wait to be released. The method of your release can take a number of different forms. By far the most popular is using melting ice, it is popular because it offers a guaranteed means of escape. DIY version of this involves place ice cubes in a stocking and then pulling it through a ring so that the ice works as a stopper which will not release until the ice melts. Alternatively you can just freeze a key to a padlock in ice and wait for it to melt. However the options above can be fiddly so you may want to think about purchasing a Ice Lock.
An alternative to ice locks is to use an electronic timer which turns lights on which lets you unlock a combination lock. Electrically activated magnetic locks could be a good option however currently specifically designed self-bondage electronic locks are hard to find. Another option more frequently used is simply tying yourself up and have a Knife or a key in a next room which you have to get to. Which is a more Houdini style bondage but is much more risky as your release is not guaranteed.
The final option in self-bondage is to have some else release,perhaps after they played with you as well. This can add a fun foreplay element to a bondage session with a partner however it is very trusting and could be considered the final stage of self-bondage.
A further way you can to your self bondage session is with toys and costumes. you may want to consider using a toy such as a vibrator or a Anal/vaginal plug to increase your sense of pleasure/torment while in bondage. These can be held in place by several different methods, see our best solo bondage toys section. Costumes can also add extra spice to your bondage, latex for example is can feel particularly good during a session. There are a dozen of different latex bondage options from full bodysuits to underwear and punishment pants. Other bondage items such as ring gags, blindfolds, clamps, and collars to name a few are also great to add to your collection. (Get ideas here)
Self bondage is a great way to indulge and explore your sexual fantasy. So why not start tonight you might just add a whole new dimension to your sex life. More ideas….
REPORT: Mattis Once Intervened in Fiery Clash Between McMaster and Bannon Over Leaks
It's no secret National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon are battling over control of President Trump's agenda. McMaster is furious with Bannon, accusing him of leaking damaging information about the Globalists to Breitbart News. Things got so bad between the two that Def Sec Mattis had to break them up.
POLITICO reports:
McMaster is fiercely at odds with Steve Bannon, the Trump strategist who was removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council in April after McMaster's appointment. In mid-July, the two sparred openly, in a widely attended policy meeting about Afghanistan, with McMaster advocating greater U.S. involvement and Bannon arguing for a major pullback. The dispute got so out of hand, according to a pair of senior White House officials, that Secretary of Defense James Mattis had to intervene to get the discussion back on track. While he has occasionally clashed with Kushner, the influential son-in-law, has a better relationship with him these days, a White House official with direct knowledge said. The officials also said that McMaster fumes that he believes Bannon is responsible for leaking negative information about him to the news media — including via Breitbart.com, the far-right news site Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign in 2016. Several of the officials, who like others spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of losing their jobs, said McMaster, who holds a Ph.D. in American history, remains on shaky ground with Trump, who they said wants to keep him — for now. A spokesman for McMaster declined to address questions about McMaster's relationship with key White House officials and his plans in the days ahead.
McMaster was hammered in the news today. The Gateway Pundit reported Sara Carter of Circa News revealed National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster granted top Obama official Susan Rice top-secret security clearance. The letter, in which McMaster notified Rice that such powers were granted to her, can be seen below.
Circa News reports:
Almost one month after it was disclosed that former President Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice was unmasking members of President Trump's team and other Americans, Trump's own national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her “need-to-know” requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure, Circa has confirmed. The undated and unclassified letter from McMaster was sent in the mail to Rice's home during the last week of April. Trump was not aware of the letter or McMaster's decision, according to two Senior West Wing officials and an intelligence official, who spoke to Circa on condition that they not be named.
This is the letter from McMaster to Rice. Names, phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred.
“I hereby waive the requirement that you must have a ‘need-to-know' to access any classified information contained in items you ‘originated, reviewed, signed or received while serving,' as National Security Adviser,” the letter said. The letter also states that the “NSC will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information.” Circa revealed in March that during President Obama's tenure, top aides — including Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch — routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the National Security Agency's incidental intercepts of Americans abroad. They were doing so by taking advantage of rules Obama relaxedstarting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, according to documents obtained by Circa.
The Gateway Pundit previously reported National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster has concluded key Obama official Susan Rice did nothing wrong in making numerous ‘unmasking' requests.
Breitbart News reports:
Two United States intelligence officials told Bloomberg's Eli Lake that McMaster has concluded that Rice did nothing wrong. That assertion is at odds with Trump's thinking, as he repeatedly raised the Rice story during speeches and media interviews. “I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story,” Trump said in an interview with the New York Times, suggesting that it was possible that she may have committed a crime. On April 12, Trump used the story to defend his accusations that the Obama administration was spying and leaking on his transition team in an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo.
“When you look at Susan Rice and what's going on and so many people are coming up to me and apologizing now,” Trump said. “They say, ‘You know, you were right when you said that.'” When Bartiromo told Trump that Rice denied doing anything political, he dismissed it.
It's been two years since we first reviewed Architectural Design with SketchUp. Since then, Alex Schreyer (the book's author) has spoken at 3D Basecamp, authored a few new SketchUp extensions, and sure enough, cooked up a second edition of this comprehensive resource for bending SketchUp to your will.
With numerous updates to the book (and its companion site SketchUpforDesign.com), we figured it was about time to update our review as well. Before we get into what's new, there are a few things you should know about this book...
It's for everyone… well, kind of. Architectural Design for SketchUp is really useful for architectural design, but as far as we can tell, it is also aimed at designers of all types. Applying and manipulating textures, mastering components, extensions, rendering: these are topics that are useful to everybody.
The caveat: this book is not intended to teach you SketchUp from scratch. There is a “SketchUp Refresher” chapter, but this book is really devoted to exploring principles of SketchUp that a) are not well-covered by existing books, and b) very, very interesting to millions of experienced SketchUp modelers everywhere.
The book is also a website. SketchUpforDesign.com is a companion website for the book, and also an excellent overall resource for SketchUp tips, news, and insight. It's also a great way to get in touch with Alex, who is one of the more responsive, friendly, and helpful folks you'll find in the SketchUp community.
The book's author is an industry expert. Somehow, we forgot to mention this in our first review. Alex Schreyer is the Director of the University of Massachusetts's Building and Construction Technology Program. He really, really knows what he's talking about.
With that, let's crack open the book. Architectural Design with SketchUp is organized into five main sections: component-based modeling, extensions, rendering, making, and Ruby scripting. Here's a closer look at what you'll find in each of these sections.
Component-based modeling
This section of Alex's book is a great primer for using groups and components to build assemblies of objects, and imbue models with information. The thinking here is that by modeling every element of a complex construction—the example he uses is a foundation/floor detail—you're effectively "building" your design before you actually build it. You save time and money and therapy sessions by making your mistakes digitally, and you end up with a better design. This isn't exactly a new concept, but Alex does a terrific job of providing concrete guidance for how to do this kind of modeling; it's the detailed how that's missing from most other resources.
Component-based modeling is a simple, incredibly important principle that Architectural Design with SketchUp explores in detail. This section of Alex's book is also a great introduction to the broader category of information modeling. We're big advocates of the idea that “BIM” only needs to be as complex as you need it to be. Alex's approach to component-based modeling lines up pretty well to that idea: at the most basic level, this book will teach you how to create, utilize, and organize components. Digging deeper, you'll also learn how to author parametric components with dynamic attributes, classify components with industry schema, and generate take-offs from your model. Or, you can just skip to the next chapter, which is all about...
Utilizing extensions
One place where even accomplished SketchUp modelers stumble is in identifying the extensions that might help them do their work. There are zillions of extensions out there, but before this book, no one had assembled a comprehensive, alphabetical listing of dozens of the most popular, most useful extensions. Not only does Alex list them; he also provides a good, brief description of what each is for. There are even a handful of step-by-step tutorials for workflows that require working between multiple extensions. This is the section of Alex's book that we'd recommend studying most carefully.
Photo-realistic rendering
Admit it: If you're not already an avid renderer, you've at least thought about how nice it would be to master that particular skill. But where to start? There's never been more choice in renderers, and everyone knows that rendering is a lot more complicated than just clicking a button and waiting a few hours. The settings, presets, lighting environments, and other widgets that go along with making a halfway decent rendering require an indecent amount of background knowledge. It's half science and half craft. With Alex's book in hand, we all might finally have a shot at learning this stuff.
Another thing we should mention: This book is 100% in color. If you think that makes a big difference when you're trying to learn about rendering, you'd be 100% correct.
Making
An entirely new section for the 2nd Edition, Alex's “Making Things with SketchUp” chapter is ample evidence that this book is useful beyond the architecture field. Here, Alex has surveyed some of the more popular digital fabrication techniques -- 3D printing, CNC, laser cutting, even 2D printing! -- and accompanied each with a primer for modeling advice, file prep, export considerations, and pre-fabrication advice for working with other software programs. This section is only about 30 pages long, but Alex gets remarkably hands-on around some important workflows. For example…
Scripting
Here's where things get a little wacky. When we saw that Alex intended to include an entire section on scripting, we thought, "Ruby for designers? Did Alex mix up his medications?" Well, as it turns out, being able to read and write simple code has never been more important. In teaching the fundamentals of Ruby scripting, Alex intelligently focuses on using scripts to generate forms that are otherwise arduous to model in SketchUp. He doesn't assume you want to create entire standalone extensions; this is really just about using the power of algorithms to make stuff when you can't think of any other way to do it. The material is by no means easy, but Alex deserves a world of credit for making it as easy as possible.
We recommend this book without hesitation to anyone who really wants to be able to make SketchUp do everything it's capable of doing. It's clearly written, well-illustrated, and comprehensive. And don't forget the icing on the cake: there's a companion website where you'll find sample files, 30 tutorial videos (12 free ones!), and a direct line of communication with the author. Buy this book and take the first step toward becoming a more useful (SketchUp) person.
If money is no object in free agency this offseason, the Mets should simply embrace the 2015 Royals team that beat them in the World Series.
They should sign Wade Davis to close, move Jeurys Familia to the eighth inning, Jerry Blevins and A.J. Ramos before that and form a super bullpen.
They should sign Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer, and turn Juan Lagares and Dom Smith into trade chips.
They should sign Mike Moustakas to play third base, because even if I think Moustakas is imperfect for New York, well, he has tons of needed power and would have all his old Kansas City buddies to make it feel like home.
But the idea of money being no object with the Mets probably makes their fans laugh more than “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Money is an object. The payroll is not going up. The expectation is it is going down. One person familiar with the team's thinking believes it could drop as much as $20 million to, say, the $135 million range.
Thus, the Royal flush dream scenario can be tossed down the drain, along with the 2017 season. Sandy Alderson is going to be tasked with trying to return the Mets to contention while cutting payroll and not having a strong farm system from which to repopulate the roster or make trades. This is not as daunting as what Alderson faced when he took over after the 2010 season. But it's pretty darn daunting.
The Mets should have roughly $30 million to $40 million available to them this offseason depending on how deep the slash is — and perhaps another $15 million if they assume insurance will again be taking care of a major portion of David Wright's salary. So it is hard to pinpoint exactly what the Mets can afford, but with lots of needs, I believe they will have to avoid the top of the market and spread what they do have to spend around. Some thoughts:
1. Fix the pen
In this age, teams must have deep pens. For the Mets, the extra reason is to shorten games to protect their fragile rotation.
My gut says the Mets will invest in one reliever. I think it should be two — one lefty, one righty — and have them join Familia, Blevins and Ramos to give whoever is managing confidence that he has five options to get the final 9-12 outs. Think about how the additions of the lefty Sean Doolittle and righty Ryan Madson so quickly changed the Nationals' pen from weakness to strength this year.
This is a good offseason to hunt in this area. There will be choices of durable righties such as Pat Neshek, Bryan Shaw and Joe Smith and durable lefties such as Tony Watson and (don't laugh) Oliver Perez. There will be 2017 breakout types, such as righties Brandon Morrow and Anthony Swarzak and lefties Brian Duensing and Mike Minor.
Addison Reed is out there if the Mets want to try a reunion. I will assume another champion Royal, Greg Holland, perhaps has too many red flags combined with cost to pursue. But Brandon Kintzler is intriguing. So is Juan Nicasio.
2. Find a mid-order bat
The most obvious place is at second and third base, but unlike with relievers, those are not fertile areas. So my thought is to bring back Jay Bruce. He would become the primary first baseman, but if Michael Conforto is not ready to start next year after shoulder surgery, then Bruce could play right.
If the Mets were rebuilding, then Dom Smith should get 500-plus at-bats next year. But I have not seen enough in his cameo to believe Smith should be the first baseman for a team trying to contend in 2018. If he shows that next year, then you could always go into some kind of rotation with Bruce moving between right and first and Conforto shifting to center.
3. But it is time to stick with Lagares in center
He is just too good on defense, and the Mets have been woeful in the field (they were last in the NL in turning batted balls in play into outs). The role models should be Toronto's Kevin Pillar and Tampa Bay's Kevin Kiermaier, whose defense kept them on the field and whose offense has slowly improved. Maybe Lagares will never learn to get the ball in the air enough. But if he does and becomes a 15-homer, 15-steal, .725 OPS, Gold Glove center fielder, that is a huge asset.
Against particularly tough righties, Conforto could start in center with Brandon Nimmo playing right and Lagares coming in late to defend if the Mets lead.
4. Find an innings eater
The Mets now have questions not only if their brittle rotation can stay healthy, but just how good the non-Jacob deGrom/Noah Syndergaard portion of the rotation is.
They likely are bringing back Matt Harvey, Steven Matz and Zack Wheeler, plus Robert Gsellman and Seth Lugo, too.
There is enough uncertainty there that a quality horse — such as Alex Cobb or Lance Lynn (both free agents) — would be ideal. But with dollars a factor, the Mets are going to have to set their sights lower, to starters who have shown a propensity for taking the ball every five days year after year, and hoping to get league average or better out of a Wade Miley (likely to not have his 2018 option picked up by Baltimore) or Jeremy Hellickson or in trades for someone such as the White Sox's James Shields, Kansas City's Jason Hammel or Houston's Mike Fiers.
In the case of trades, I believe all of those players would be more salary dumps and not cost any significant prospects and, in some cases, money might even be thrown in.
The Mets also could consider a swingman type such as Trevor Cahill, Jesse Chavez or Bud Norris, who could provide long relief or starting options. Again, remember that they will be shopping in the discount bin.
5. Fix second or third
That begins with picking up Asdrubal Cabrera's $8.5 million option (it is really a $6.5 million decision because there is a $2 million buyout) because he can play second or third, giving the Mets the wiggle room to try to make the best deal for one or the other.
I know Jose Reyes is the fans' choice, but I believe at this stage Cabrera gives the Mets better coverage at second and third, and no less a valuable veteran voice in the clubhouse.
As for finding a second or third baseman, free agents such as Howie Kendrick and Eduardo Nunez give positional flexibility and some offensive punch.
The Cardinals are overloaded with position players and probably have to thin the herd and a pitcher such as Gsellman could be intriguing bait. Jedd Gyroko and particularly the athletic Kolten Wong are interesting.
Here is one I would look into: Zack Cozart is a free agent. He is a very good shortstop, but aside from the Padres and perhaps the Orioles, it is hard to see teams that will aggressively pursue a shortstop this offseason.
If the Mets believe Cozart can play second, then they would get a strong hitter (he had a .925 OPS outside of the offensive haven of Great American Ballpark), plus insurance in case Amed Rosario needed further minor league seasoning.
If you place 32 metronomes on a static object and set them rocking out of phase with one another, they will remain that way indefinitely. Place them on a moveable surface, however, and something very interesting (and very mesmerizing) happens.
The metronomes in this video fall into the latter camp. Energy from the motion of one ticking metronome can affect the motion of every metronome around it, while the motion of every other metronome affects the motion of our original metronome right back. All this inter-metranome "communication" is facilitated by the board, which serves as an energetic intermediary between all the metronomes that rest upon its surface. The metronomes in this video (which are really just pendulums, or, if you want to get really technical, oscillators) are said to be "coupled."

The math and physics surrounding coupled oscillators are actually relevant to a variety of scientific phenomena, including the transfer of sound and thermal conductivity. For a much more detailed explanation of how this works, and how to try it for yourself, check out this excellent video by condensed matter physicist Adam Milcovich.

(WOMENSENEWS)–For generations, Indian women have been reared on religious epics, filled with patiently suffering, self-sacrificing women. But a new breed of writers–many of them women–are rewriting sacred scriptures.
But not without setting off intense protests from Hindu groups objecting to the new characterizations of women featured in ancient epics.
One of these modern versions, a retelling of the Ramayana by 27-year-old writer Samhita Arni with graphic artist Moyna Chitrakar, has just spent two weeks on the New York Times bestseller list for graphic novels.
The Ramayana is a sacred epic first written by the sage Valmiki in 500 B.C. that spawned hundreds of variations across India, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia.
Arni's acclaimed "Sita's Ramayana" retells the epic from the point of view of Sita, wife of the earthbound deity Prince Rama. Kidnapped by the demon Ravana, Sita is eventually rescued by Rama, but not until she has gone through a trial by fire to prove her purity. Arni's novel portrays Sita as a strong, powerful woman who takes fate into her own hands.
Meanwhile writer Arshia Sattar, a self described feminist, has also released a new book called "Lost Loves," which looks at Rama and Sita as humans rather than gods and dissects Rama's actions dispassionately.
This September, Indian-American filmmaker Virali Gokuldas premiered a play called "Janaki: Daughter of Dirt" in San Francisco, which features a modern Indian woman using Sita's tale to make sense of her own life.
American filmmaker Nina Paley used the Ramayana as a parallel to the story of her own failed marriage in her 2008 animated film "Sita Sings the Blues."
Controversial Epics
The new versions of these epics are controversial.
In October, Delhi University decided to drop an essay by the late linguist and scholar A.K. Ramanujan from its syllabus, following violent protests by the student wing of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
The essay, "Three A Hundred Ramayanas," talks about the many versions of the Ramayana, including some in which Sita is portrayed as Ravana's daughter and another in which Ravana is actually a hero.
The university has been strongly criticized by academics and students for caving in to pressure from Hindutva groups, who say they will not allow any "blasphemous" versions of the Ramayana to be circulated.
Meanwhile, Oxford University Press, Ramanujan's publisher, stopped printing his collected essays, citing "minimal demand." This month, following protests and accusations of censorship by over 450 scholars, authors and students, Oxford University Press did a complete turnaround and announced that it would reprint the essays.
In July and September this year, screenings of "Sita Sings the Blues" were cancelled in New York and Goa, India, following protests by Hindu groups who called the film "shameful" and "denigrating."
Despite protests, Arni believes that women need to "reclaim" the many versions of the Ramayana.
"Right-wing Hindu groups want to impose their own version of the Ramayana on us because it suits their political purposes," she says. "India has such a rich and diverse storytelling tradition, both oral and written. It would be a tragedy to lose it."
Arni is currently writing a speculative novel on the search for Sita, set in modern times, featuring a Rama with distinctly human failings. She admits to being a bit worried about how it will be received, but plans to go ahead anyway.
"India is getting more intolerant, but if we writers don't stand up for artistic freedom, who will?" she says.

Could chatbots lend a non-judgemental ear to people making decisions about the end of their life? A virtual agent that helps people have conversations about their funeral plans, wills and spiritual matters is set to be trialled in Boston over the next two years with people who are terminally ill.
People near the end of their lives sometimes don't get the chance to have these important conversations before it's too late, says Timothy Bickmore at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. So Bickmore and his team – which included doctors and hospital chaplains – built a tablet-based chatbot to offer spiritual and emotional guidance to people that need it. “We see a need for technology to intervene at an earlier point,” he says.
And it has already seen some success. Bickmore's team initially tested the chatbot with 44 people aged 55 and over in Boston. Just under half those adults had some kind of chronic illness, and nearly all had spent time with someone who was dying. After spending time talking to the chatbot, most of the participants reported that they felt less anxious about death and were more ready to complete their last will and testament.

Next steps
For the next stage of the trial, Bickmore plans to give tablets loaded with the chatbot to 364 people who have been told they have less than a year to live. The slightly more souped-up version can also take users through guided meditation sessions and talk to them about their health and medication, as well as conversing on a wide range of religious topics.
The earlier people start considering how they want to die and what they want to happen afterwards, the easier it is for those around them to act on those decisions – for example, ensuring they don't die in hospice if they would prefer to be at home.
The chatbot, does not, however, formalise any of these plans. Rather, if a person tells it that they're getting ready to make decisions about their end-of-life plans, it will alert a family member or nominated caregiver to follow up on that conversation in real life.
Chatbots have come under fire recently for veering into inappropriate behaviour, so Bickmore kept things simple with his bot. Unlike voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri, it isn't fully autonomous but sticks to a fairly rigid script, only asking people to choose options from a pre-written list of responses. An unscripted system, he says, might very easily “get into situations where the agent recommends things that are dangerous”.
Providing comfort
Bickmore says the chatbot could be particularly helpful for people that are socially isolated and otherwise wouldn't be having difficult end-of-life conversations at all.
“It's hard for humans to be non-judgemental when they're having these kinds of conversations,” says Rosemary Lloyd from The Conversation Project, a charity that encourages people to have conversations about their end of life care. “So some people might find it easier to talk to a chatbot about their thoughts.”
Harriet Warshaw at The Conversation Project says a chatbot would be a good first step towards talking about end-of-life decisions with a loved one.
We've also long known that talking about difficult topics with automated agents is oddly comforting, whereas talking about your end-of-life decisions with people who will be most affected by them is particularly emotionally fraught.
Writer and film-maker Avril Furness agrees that technology can be a useful way to help people start having difficult conversations about death.
Furness, who has explored the subject of assisted suicide, says Bickmore's chatbot system is another good way to get people thinking about the end of their life, helping them work through their feelings without worrying what someone else thinks. “This chatbot isn't going to judge you.”
Path of building shows my dps as almost 300k ( 1.4mil with 20 wither stacks ) on tornado shot and 3mil dps ( 16.6 mil with 20 wither stacks ) on barrage. However the most ull reach is 10 wither stacks, therefore, just halve that damage, which is still a fuck ton.
PS. The build idea was inspiried from someone on reddit who made a comment about such a build. i lost the post but here is the credit to the person whoever you are.

INTRODUCTION
Pros:
+ Non-meta items, (cheap to find) (total cost of my "godly"gear is 50ex at most.) [still cheaper than brood twine ]
+ Clears fast
+ reflect immune
+ high es (10k+)
+ Unethical double-dipping
+ Beautiful purple puffs when things die
Cons:
- Poison immune mobs can be a pain, but doable
- Can be expensive to gear in the end game
- Unethical double-dipping
SKILL TREE
Look at my character profile for lvl93 skill tree, (lower lvls , get at least 7k es, then go for dmg nodes, dmg not as important due to high poison dmg already)
Passives
Ascendancy Points: Master Herbalist ( most impt for poison wont work without) > Nature's Boon > Master Alchemist > Nature's Adrenaline.
Bandits: Point/ Atk spd Or Point / Point
SKILL TREE EXPLANATION
I went for less dmg and more es so that the build will be end game viable . And mostly nodes that double dip for massive scaling.
JEWELS
Go for es% > Atk spd > proj dmg / Dmg / Chaos dmg
SKILL DPS
Not a build for tooltip warriors. but 366k inc poison for Tornado shot (without wither stacks)
400k on barrage(1 arrow ) 3mil ( all arrows) . However for single target drop wither totem and barrage can hit up to 18mil dps!!!!
DEFENSE
86% for fire and light , 76% for cold. currently 10.3k es too.
GEAR
My current gear :
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH DPS, GO FOR CULLING STRIKE BOW INSTEAD, ITS WAY BETTER, +1 arrow is good, but once dps hits a certain threshold , Cull gets things done faster, due to poison tick rate.
additionally, u will want opal rings with , WED, CHaos dmg, and flat light, if ever possible.
GEAR EXPLANATION
Voltaxic ( Must have ) for light to chaos conversion.
Eye of chayula ( must have for stun immunity )
Soulstrike/ drillneck whichever u prefer but if u choose drill neck , u need to get pierce nodes / use void walkers.
whalers boots for dps scaling /
Thunderfist also dps scaling.
LINKS AND GEMS
Been asked this way too many times, but both LA and TS work fine, its a personal choice. Links are the same, so swap out and test both :)
Tornado Shot/LA > Weapon ele dmg > Void mani > Ele focus > Slower Proj > Pierce. ( drop pierce for 5L , 4L drop ele focus)
Barrage > Weapon Ele Dmg > Void Mani > Ele Focus > Slower proj >added light/ (if u can get colours) Slower proj. (5L drop added light, 4L drop ele focus)
CWDT Setup
CWDT> Immortal Call > Blink arrow > Light golem / Flame golem ( 3r 1g can be hard for int helm)
Aura Setup
I put Auras in +1 boots for more dps and ES.
Wrath > HOT > Discipline > Blood rage (frenzy charge )
LEVELING
Level as you would any TS ranger build , use death's harp > death's opus > Voltaxic.
THE END

The Berkeley mayor who tells the police to stand down and allows the Antifa terrorist group to assault pro-Trump supporters is a terrorist himself. Got News reports that Mayor Jesse Arreguin is a member of the communist anti-facist militia (Antifa) By Any Means Necessary (BAMN).
He was listed as a member on Facebook among 35 group memberships but has since taken it down. He still lists the lead BAMN ringleader Yvette Falarca as one of his friends on the social media site.
Arreguin's Facebook friend was identified at a Berkeley anti-censorship rally, where the woman was among masked individuals who assaulted, and could have murdered attendees.
Got News reports:
BAMN was cited in January 2002 FBI report as among “various groups and individuals within the state of Michigan who are thought to be involved in terrorist activities.” The agency internal document relayed discussions at a domestic terror symposium hosted by the Michigan State Police Criminal Intelligence Unit, and attended by the FBI, the Secret Service, Michigan Department of Corrections, Michigan State University Public Safety, and the Michigan National Guard/Army Reserve. There, one Michigan detective “presented information on a protest from February 8-10, 2002 in Arin Arbor, Michigan, by the group Any Means Necessary,” adding, “Michigan State Police has information that in the past demonstrations by this group have been peaceful.”
BAMN no longer pretends to be anything but violent.
Here is Fellarca beating a man as he begs police to help.
She called her last violent assault a “stunning achievement”. The Milo Yiannopoulos event was Fellarca's work as well.
Fellarca is a middle school teacher who helped plan the original Berkeley riots. She and her goons attacked Trump supporters then without any repercussions. The police just stand there doing nothing.

In this article, I will be showing you how to make a crude form of aspirin from the bark of a willow tree. It is a great remedy for headaches, hangovers, and other minor pain. The use of the willow tree as a mild pain reliever goes back to the Native Americans, who used it in much the same way that I do. Before we go any further, I am going to explain what we are making and how it differs from commercial aspirin. Commercial aspirin is a chemical called acetylsalicylic acid (say that one three times fast!). What we will be making is simply an herbal tea that contains salicylic acid, which is the raw material from which acetylsalicylic acid is made. So, why do they convert it from the raw salicylic acid into the commercial form? Two reasons: It increases the shelf life of the medicine. Salicylic acid becomes dangerous to use if you concentrate it. Pharmaceutical companies are not happy with just picking a leaf or cutting some bark from a tree...they like to concentrate everything and make it as potent as they can. If you do this with salicylic acid, it can cause stomach bleeding. But, as long as you use it in a natural, unconcentrated form (like the willow-bark tea we are going to make), it is perfectly safe. I have used it for years with no ill affects whatsoever. So, now that you know what we are making, we can get to the process of making it.
Step 1: Learn to Identify Willow Trees One little thing about herbal medicine to remember: If you have any doubt about the identity of a plant, don't use it. NEVER use a plant medicine unless you are 100% sure you have the right kind of plant. Using the wrong kind of plant can result in illness and/or untimely death. There are basically four types of Willow trees.
The Weeping Willow
The Black Willow
The Golden Willow
The White Willow I believe this contains the most salicylic acid. This is the species I use most of the time because it is very easy to find. As you can see from the picture, it always grows near the water. Also, I was told by some Cherokee folks that this kind of willow contains the most medicine. All the research I have done since then seems to confirm this. All these species of tree contain the chemical we are looking for, in varying amounts. Although the white willow (or "creek willow" as some people call it) is the most potent, all of them will work. So, how do you identify it for sure? well, first you will need to look at the leaves. They should look about like this: Some of them are a little thicker, like this: Now examine the bark. It should look something like the pictures below: Images via wikimedia.org, discoverlife.org, blogspot.com Now, at this point, I would break off some of the leaves and smell them. This is because I have used this plant for many years and I know its smell very well. You, however, do not know the smell that we are looking for. So, here's what I want you to do: Grab a handful of leaves, crush them up some, and smell them. I don't just mean take a quick sniff, I mean really take your time and make yourself familiar with that smell. Take pictures of the tree, and take some of its leaves with you. Once you have done this, you are ready to verify the identity of your tree. The best way is simply to take your pictures and your samples to a professor of botany. If there is a university in your area, this should be no problem. If not, you can always email your pictures to the nearest one. If you are new to the study of plants, do not neglect this step. As I said before, ingesting random plants is a good way to die. Once you have gotten a positive ID from an expert, you should be able to identify willow trees yourself from then on. Remember the smell particularly, as this is the best way I have found to identify a willow tree, even in winter when the leaves are gone.
Step 2: Cut a Square of Bark Once you are absolutely sure that you have found a Willow tree, you are ready to harvest the bark. Like all trees, the willow has an outer bark and an inner bark. The inner bark is what we want. So, get a good sharp knife out and cut a square into the tree: Make sure to cut it good and deep. Remember, you are trying to cut through both the outer bark and the inner bark. Go over your lines a few more times with your knife and deepen the cuts. If your knife has some saw teeth on it like mine does, this is a good time to use them. Now, stick the point of your knife into one of the lines and gently pry outward. Go around the whole square, gently prying outward so as to gradually pull your square away from the rest of the tree. Remember not to pry too hard. If you do, you will just make the bark fly off in chunks, scattering the material that you are after. Instead, you want it to come off in one or a few large pieces. So, keep going around the square, prying a little farther each time, until finally your square starts to come loose in the desired fashion. Now, just keep doing what you've been doing. When three sides are lifted free, you can just peel it like this: Notice that some of the bark is white, and some of it is pinkish. The pinkish bark is what we want. As you can see, my square has come off in two pieces, which is fine. Now let's just cut the last side off: At this point, I still have some little shreds of pinkish bark clinging to the tree. Of course, these need to be cut off as well. Cut or scrape off all the pinkish bark you can see. Here is what I ended up with: Two big pieces and a few little shreds. Here is what the tree looked like: Now, just in case you think that I have terribly damaged this tree, let me enlighten you. This little scar will heal rather quickly, and will not do any lasting harm to the tree whatsoever. In case you don't believe me, check this out. This is a willow tree that I cut a square from, about six months ago: As you can see, it is already healing up nicely. It has an ugly scar, but in time that will also be gone. While we're on the subject, I want to talk about sustainable harvesting. When taking materials directly from nature, it is vitally important not to use more than you need. It is also vitally important to avoid destroying the source. In this case, you can avoid doing any harm to nature by following these two simple rules: Never take from the same tree twice in one year. In other words, whenever you take a square from a willow tree, you should not go back to that specific tree again for another year. This gives the trees time to heal themselves so that the stress upon them is minimized. NEVER cut a ring all the way around the bark. Just take a square about as big as your palm, that is all you need for a single dose. If you take too much bark at one time, it can kill the tree. If you cut out a ring around the tree, it will definitely kill it. Now, just wrap your pieces of bark in a napkin and head home.

Here's a moment that a certain formerly absurdly hormonal teenage girl had been looking forward to for some time. As had many others in the audience, to judge from the rapturous applause that greets Sting as he takes the TED stage. He plays some songs from his upcoming Broadway musical, The Last Ship.
It's the story of his own upbringing, raised in the shadow of a shipyard in northeast England. In fact, Sting escaped from there as quickly as he possibly could, but he describes being roiled by writer's block and forced to fall back on writing what he knew. “It's ironic that the landscape I worked so hard to escape from, the community I more or less abandoned, is where I had to return to to find my missing muse,” he said. “As soon as I decided to honor the community I came from to tell their story, the songs started to come thick and fast.” The process reminded him that whether you're a rockstar or a ship-builder, a tribesman in the Amazon or a member of the royal family, we're all essentially the same. We're all in the same boat.
With an encore of “Message in a Bottle,” which prompted some delightfully tuneful singing from most of the TED audience, that was the end of the first full day at TED.
It all started with a 3 a.m. visit to a goat barn.
In the pre-dawn hours of August 22, an employee of Oak Knoll Dairy farm stopped by to check on one of a handful of structures holding the farm's 800 goats. This particular barn was filled with pregnant goats and kids, and happened to be next to a concrete building stacked high with manure. Dealing with the ever-growing piles of manure is obviously a design challenge for any goat farmer and Windsor's partial-solution was to house the stuff in a little outhouse slightly downhill from the birthing barn. Inside the concrete building, though, the goat manure kept rising, up to its 20-foot-tall ceilings, taking up around 120 cubic feet of space.
But the farmworker didn't smell goat dung – she smelled smoke. She woke up farm owners George Redick and Linda Renbo, his wife, and the blaze got hosed down. The Fire Department also came to inspect. Soon, residents all over the Vermont hamlet were talking about the peculiar smell. The incident made international news, as people took to Facebook to complain bitterly about the noxious odors. The town manager likened it to “a damp kind of burning leaves or brush fire” (it “wasn't like a whiff” either) while another townsman said it smelled like bacon.”Because there was no wind, and because there was a foggy morning, it just permeated the town,” said Redick, before adding, “certainly not as bad as green cow manure in the spring.”
Redick's first reaction, though, was “oh no, not this again.” Welcome to one of the strangest hazards of working with farm animals: spontaneous manure combustion.
Typically one hears about spontaneous combustion in terms of “spontaneous human combustion,” which, according to to fire expert Angelo Pisani, is a myth (“you know that, right?”) But spontaneous combustion itself is very real, and can have multiple causes. In the case of the goat manure, it's a bacterial thing: the bacteria in the animal droppings multiply, create heat, and in the pile, it gets hotter and hotter. Get some oxygen in the mix and it can ignite. Eventually, smoke starts seeping out. “Every fuel has a different ignition,” says Pisani, guessing that goat manure would be between 200-300 degrees. While this kind of fire is rare in cities, Pisani says it's “fairly common” in farmland. “If people don't pay attention to how they are storing [manure], it combusts,” he says, noting that another common spontaneous combustion occurs in manufacturing, with lynseed oil. When people leave rags with that oil in a pile, they can start a fire. (Fun fact: if you leave cloth with olive oil in a dryer for too long, that can also spontaneously combust.)
Good statistics on incidence of manure's fire-starting capibilities are hard to come by, although some huge fires have come from sitting dung. In 2007, for instance, a 200-acre California blaze got started from manure and in 2009, manure sparked another California fire, this time encompassing over 6,000 acres in Ventura County. Far more common, though, according to Redick, are small piles that emit smoke and are quickly put out. In his experience, manure spontaneous combustion is a bit of a joke – the kind of thing a farmer would claim if he accidentally burned down a barn because of some other, more human error. “To be honest, it happened a year before as well,” he said, referring to a fire in the concrete building, “and didn't bother any one.” He termed the fire department's decision to put it out a “political” choice, since last year, they just let the fire burn out itself.
Not that Redick really minds the attention his goat manure fire has brought his farm. In addition to giving interviews to everyone from the local paper to the Associated Press, Redick proudly recounted being an answer on a recent episode of NPR's “Wait, Wait… Don't Tell Me!” “We make goat milk and yogurt but we can't afford advertisements. As my sister's boyfriend said, ‘You should milk this for all its worth,'” the goat farmer said, laughing.
Still, though, some changes have been made. The concrete manure shed has been dug out, excavated. It took more than a week to put out all the little goat dung spontaneous fires.
An earlier version of the story misidentified the name of the goat farm.

Postal workers are set to receive millions of pounds' worth of Royal Mail shares when the company is privatised later this year.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said employees would be given 10% of shares as part of a stock market flotation.
He described it as "the biggest employee share scheme for nearly 30 years".
Unions have reacted angrily to the plans and have threatened to ballot for strike action.
The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said the sale of Royal Mail was "unwanted by public, customers and the workers".
The government has opted to float the company on the London Stock Exchange rather than sell it to a private buyer.
Members of the public will be able to buy shares, alongside larger institutional investors.
Commercial freedom
But 10% of shares are being set aside for eligible members of Royal Mail staff, which they will get for nothing.
"Now the time has come for government to step back from Royal Mail, allow its management to focus wholeheartedly on growing the business and planning for the future," Mr Cable told MPs.
"It's now time for employees to hold a stake in the company and share in its success.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dave Ward, CWU: "If you bring in private owners to Royal Mail, they will change the priorities of the company"
"This government will give Royal Mail the real commercial freedom it's needed for a long time."
The sale is likely to value the business at £2bn-£3bn, suggesting up to 150,000 staff will receive £200m-£300m in shares.
The government says the sale is necessary in order to give Royal Mail the access to private capital it needs to grow and remain competitive.
It is currently revamping its business to focus less on the delivery of letters and more on parcels, in order to benefit from the rapid growth of internet shopping.
A boom in parcel delivery helped Royal Mail to more than double its profits last year, after many years of losses.
Mr Cable also said privatisation was necessary to ensure that universal service, which guarantees delivery to all parts of the UK on six days of the week, can continue.
But both Labour and the unions argued the move made no sense.
"Having nationalised the organisation's debts by taking on its pension liabilities, they now want to privatise the profit at the very time it is making money. How on earth does that make any sense?" said Labour's Chuka Umunna.
Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU, said the flotation announcement had "ignored the views of the workforce and the British public".
Strike warning
"The workforce agreed a modernisation programme with Royal Mail three years ago and it didn't include privatisation," he said.
Unlike the great privatisations of the past, of the gas, electricity and telecoms industry, there will be no aggressive attempt to sell the shares to individuals - there will be no campaign such as the famous 'Tell Sid' adverts of the 1980s for the flotation of British Gas
"They have worked hard to modernise the company and deliver the profitable organisation Royal Mail is today. They have recently voted in big numbers against the sale and they will be angered by today's announcement."
He said the union would continue to fight the sale and warned that, without a legally binding agreement on terms and conditions, strike action was "inevitable".
The CWU represents about two-thirds of Royal Mail staff. Earlier this year, its members voted overwhelmingly against privatisation.
The threat of strikes means it is possible that the share sale, set to take place towards the end of the year, could take place under industrial action.
Speaking later to the BBC, Mr Cable described the share offer and a recent pay offer by Royal Mail as "attractive" and said he hoped strike action would not ensue.
"I think when they look at this in the cold light of day, I think they will see that it is in their interests not to disrupt it," he said.
In a statement, Moya Greene, Chief Executive Officer of Royal Mail Group said: "Our employees will have a meaningful stake in the company and its future success. The public will have the opportunity to invest in a great British institution."
"As we move into the private sector, the current legal position is that all terms and conditions that apply to Royal Mail employees would remain in place, on the same basis," she said.
The flotation is likely to be one of the biggest since large utility companies such as British Gas were privatised in the 1980s.
It will not include the Post Office, which is a now a separate company.
The government said it planned to invest in the network of post offices and potentially set it up as a mutual business.
Editor's Note: This is part one of a two-part interview series about Christian martyrdom.
A Myth of Christian Persecution? Candida Moss Claims Many Historical Martyrdom Stories Were Exaggerated Invented and Forged More
Photo Credit: Dr. Candida Moss
Dr. Candida Moss, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, captured attention earlier this year with the publication of her book, "The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom." From the title, alone, you can discern that the subject matter is controversial. Moss, a practicing Catholic and an expert on Christianity, contends that the early church "exaggerated, invented, and forged stories of Christian martyrs."
Certainly advancing some bold claims, the professor holds that the so-called "Age of Martyrs" was, at least in part, fictional. This was the time-frame before Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in the fourth century -- a period during which many allege that believers were brutally murdered by Roman authorities. Stories are often told today of the plight that these individuals faced.
But Moss believes that many of these narratives were exaggerations used to push back against heretics, to inspire believers and to gain support for church funding. With the purported tales continuing to be told, the professor is attempting to set straight a record she believes to be intensely inaccurate. TheBlaze interviewed Moss to gain more information about her perspective.
-
THEBLAZE: Why do you believe that this so-called "myth" of martyrdom developed within the Christian faith?
MOSS: First, I would like to establish what this myth is, and what it isn't. It is the idea that Christians were continually persecuted for their beliefs; it is not a denial of all Christian martyrs from Antiquity today.
The reason we think that they were constantly persecuted is because later Christians exaggerated the numbers of martyrs and the severity of the persecutions in order to entertain, educate, and combat heresy. There wasn't necessarily anything malicious about this; they were using the heroes of the faith to speak to the issues of their own day in the same way that we use the founding fathers to educate our children.
THEBLAZE: What led you to write "The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom"?
MOSS: Well, I had already written two other books concerning the importance of Biblical and early Church traditions about sufferings for Christianity. I wrote this book because a lot of Christian groups and individuals today refer to themselves as persecuted just like Jesus and the early Christians. Often they will talk about how Christians have always been persecuted and point to the Roman emperors as the start of that process.
Historians unanimously agree that this isn't true, but we haven't done a good job of conveying this to a wider audience. I wanted to change that and present the historical evidence for actual persecution and martyrdom in a form that's accessible to everyone.

THEBLAZE: What do you hope readers take away from the book?
MOSS: Correcting the misunderstandings that surround martyrdom in the early church is not a question of tidying up some ancient facts or revising our understanding of events that happened in the distant past. It's not merely academic. The view that the history of Christianity is a history of unrelenting persecution persists in modern religious and political debate about what it means to be Christian.
The problem is that when we apply the language of persecution to political debates or disagreements, our opponents think we're being hysterical and we make it impossible to have reasonable discussions about how society should be run. Moreover, some Christians in other parts of the world -- like Egypt or the Congo -- really are persecuted and we take the spotlight off of them when claim that we're persecuted when we're not.
All 50 of South Carolina's delegates are duty-bound to support Trump on a first vote, but interviews with two dozen prospective delegates and party insiders — including several Trump backers — reveal a widespread belief that Cruz and Kasich will succeed in wresting the delegation away from Trump if the nomination fight heads to a second ballot. If Trump is unable to claim the nomination immediately, South Carolina could help tip the scales away from the New York billionaire.
“I could never vote for Donald Trump, ever,” said Vic Dabney of Kershaw County, S.C., a Cruz supporter who said he is pursuing a run for delegate. “He shares none of my values.”
Working against Trump is the fact that South Carolina's potential delegates may only be drawn from the 925 party insiders who attended the state's GOP convention in 2015. It's a pool of party veterans who helped reelect the state's GOP chairman Matt Moore — who has been vocally critical of Trump — with 83 percent support last year.
Some of the insiders who staffed that reelection fight are now working to help Kasich recruit delegates, even though the Ohio governor was trounced in the South Carolina primary, winning just 7 percent of the vote and finishing fifth among six candidates.
The lessons from Hurricane Katrina, laid out in concrete, steel, earth, marsh, and in the ambitious master plan, are being watched with interest from New York to Florida and the Texas Coast. People within sight of any coast want a wall to call their own.
To the northeast, New York and New Jersey are looking at multibillion-dollar proposals to limit the damage that could be caused by the next Hurricane Sandy. To the west, Galveston, Tex., wants an “Ike Dike,” a great wall to blunt storms like Hurricane Ike in 2008.
Officials also have come from around the world by the planeload to see what is rising here.
Ricky Boyett, a spokesman for the New Orleans district for the Army Corps of Engineers, said that in 2010, during the corps' construction boom on the system, he and his colleagues conducted more than 400 tours for congressional delegations and officials from two dozen nations, including Bangladesh, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, not to mention visiting conventioneers. After that, he said, “we quit counting.”
René Poché, another corps spokesman, said that he had led so many tours that he sometimes felt like a guide at Disneyland. “I have the pith hat,” he joked. “I have my little jungle vest.”
The tour buses would take visitors to see such engineering feats as the Lake Borgne wall and the gargantuan pump station and gates at the Harvey Canal on the West Bank, and end up at the 17th Street canal — then, as often as not, they would stop for lunch at Deanie's Seafood in the nearby Bucktown neighborhood for shrimp, crawfish and spicy boiled potatoes.
CNN has booted Kathy Griffin from its New Year's Eve coverage for her disturbing photoshoot holding up a faux severed and bloody head of President Trump.
The network said in a statement Wednesday, “CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year's Eve program.”
Griffin has co-hosted CNN's “New Year's Eve Live” broadcast with Anderson Cooper since 2007.
After the controversial image of Griffin went viral Tuesday, sparking widespread backlash on both the right and left, Cooper tweeted, “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”
CNN's Jake Tapper also denounced the imagery on air.
Griffin later apologized for the disturbing photo in a Twitter video Tuesday night, saying, “I went way too far. I made a mistake and I was wrong.”
Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday blasted Griffin for the disturbing stunt.
“Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” President Trump tweeted at about 7:30 a.m.
First lady Melania Trump said in a statement Wednesday, “As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing.”
“When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it,” the statement continued.
Have you ever heard about a game called Custom Maid 3D? If you haven't, well let's start by saying that it is definitely not a game for kids, and it is definitely NSFW. The basic premise is that you can create a custom maid in 3D and do sexual things to them using the Ju-C Air Support controller. For those unfamiliar, the Ju-C Air controller is a device where male gamers get to stick their privates in, and from there they get to pleasure themselves and the game will respond in kind. In any case this is somewhat old news as the game and device was revealed back in February, but what's interesting is that while we've seen the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset used for more conventional games, it seems that the developers behind Custom Maid 3D have released an update that will allow the headset to be used in conjunction with the game!
Erotic games are not new to the Oculus Rift and some of you might have heard of Wicked Paradise, so technically this update to Custom Maid 3D will make it the second erotic game to support the Oculus Rift headset. While we have to play the game for ourselves, and with no plans to at the moment, we can't really comment on what the experience is like, but assuming it was pleasurable before, we can only imagine the sensation will be kicked up a notch thanks to a more immersive gameplay.

The dead zone that has formed in the Gulf of Mexico this summer is smaller than predicted, but is still larger than average, spanning an area roughly the size of Connecticut. This zone, an area without oxygen and almost completely devoid of life that crops up every summer, covers 5,840 square miles (15,125 square kilometers), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
In June, NOAA predicted the dead zone would be at least 20 percent larger this summer, expecting it to take up at least 7,286 square miles (18,871 square km).
Dead zones are the indirect result of nutrients, largely from fertilizer use, running off into rivers and then into bodies of water such as the gulf. Once these excess nutrients reach the ocean, they fuel algae blooms. The algae then die and decompose in a process that consumes oxygen and creates oxygen-free areas where fish and other aquatic creatures can't survive. This zone can have serious impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries on the Gulf Coast, causing fish die-offs.
But the dead zone this summer, the time of year when the phenomenon occurs, is larger than average: Over the past five years, the average dead zone has covered 5,176 square miles (13,405 km), according to NOAA. That's more than twice the 1,900-square- mile (4,921 square km) goal set by the Gulf of Mexico / Mississippi River Watershed Nutrient Task Force, a group that seeks to reduce the size of this lifeless area, according to NOAA.
Last summer, the dead zone in the gulf was the fourth-smallest on record, thanks to a drought that gripped much of the central United States; less rainfall means less nutrient runoff. That dead zone measured 2,889 square miles (7,482 square km), an area slightly larger than Delaware, NOAA reported. The biggest dead zone on record came in 2002, when it reached 8,481 square miles (21,965 square km).
This year's dead zone is smaller than predicted due in part to strong winds over the gulf, which mixed oxygen into deeper waters, according to NOAA.
The zone was mapped during a research cruise from July 21-28 and led by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium. A final survey will take place in mid-August.

JACKSON, MI — High above downtown Jackson, four peregrine falcon chicks are growing fast and preparing for the day, not long from now, they'll take their first flights.
First, they need names!
Readers
for the four chicks (
). We want you to vote for your favorites.
The fine folks in Jackson County government, who provide a home for the falcons up on the County Tower Building, have agreed to let MLive readers select the names through a poll.
Last week, county information technology director Connie Frey and I winnowed the list of suggestions down to 16 names. We didn't want to make the poll unwieldy, and we tried to pick names that had some local relevance or just sounded interesting.
Now comes the fun part, but with a wrinkle. We don't yet know the sex of the chicks, so we are offering male, female and unisex names in the poll. Choose your favorites — as many as you want, as often as you want — and they'll be assigned later.
The birds' sexes will be determined when they are banded by state wildlife officials in early June. If, say, the first bird is determined to be male, officials will look for the top vote-getter in this poll with a male name. At that point, of course, we'll let you know the birds' names!
For now, start voting and spread the word. Make your case in the comments section for which name is the best, too. Vote as often as you like through the end of the day Thursday. Have fun!
Creepshots, a Reddit message board, is facing calls for closure amid the growing controversy about the sexual photos posted of unsuspecting women. As estimated 40 percent of the naughty pictures posted were allegedly taken of underage girls, according to the Daily Mail.
A forum opponent seeking to permanently close the increasingly popular Creepshots sub-forum are particularly concerned with sexualized images of teenage girls. Reddit has encountered controversy over its forums before when a page showcasing “barely legal” girls was also the target of protests.
Most of the photos posted of reportedly non-consenting women zoom in on either clothed buttocks or breasts. The rather prolific Creepshots poster who goes by the username, Weagleweaglewde, has published up the skirt pictures of a girl in a cheerleading uniform, prompting many of those angry about the online message board to believe the man is a high school teacher; but he could also be a fellow student, Jezebel reports.
One Reddit user angry about invasion of privacy posted this on the internet bulletin board:
“What's particularly disturbing about the voyeur subReddits is that individuals are having their perverse, invasive, and illegal behavior validated and encouraged by many others. Students should be able to attend class without having their privacy violated by fellow students and trusted adult authority figures like teachers. Girls should be able to go to school without worrying that sexually suggestive images of them are being uploaded to popular websites like Reddit, for thousands to view.”
Since 2006, Reddit has been owned by Conde Nast publishers, which also own the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and GQ.
Parents Concerned After Gun Brought to Elementary School Video
BRYANT, Ark. -- A Davis Elementary student in Bryant was caught with an unloaded gun in their backpack Thursday.
According to a statement from Bryant Public Schools, a student was found with an unloaded handgun inside their backpack.
Law enforcement was notified and the gun was confiscated.
No one was hurt and students were not in immediate danger.
But this notification never made it to father of two, Nathan Leonard.
"In a way I feel like they were trying to just keep it hush, hush and sweep it under the rug. Well just because nobody got hurt doesn't mean you know, we can't learn from it," he said.
Leonard learned of the incident through a private Facebook group between Shannon Hills neighbors.
The school message was copied to the page by a page follower. It is, they said the school message came from a program called "Blackboard," a communication tool Leonard and others on the page were unfamiliar with.
A conversation with the superintendent also revealed to Leonard that the regular school resource officer was off Thursday.
Despite having the Shannon Hills Police Department one block away, he was told protocol is to call the next resource officer at another school.
"But, I could care less about school protocol when it comes to kids," Leonard said.
While Leonard is grateful no one was hurt, he hopes if there is a next time, that communication changes will be made.
"Next time I want to be able to have faith that I'm going to be informed."
In the statement, the school district says they "will follow its established discipline policies to address the incident."
Sen. Harry Reid — under pressure from the Federal Election Commission — revealed that he gave about $17,000 in campaign cash to his granddaughter in two separate payments that were recorded in his books as “holiday gifts.”
Shortly after the payments came to light, Mr. Reid also announced he was refunding the money, The New York Post reported.
The checks were cut in amounts of $5,417 and $11,370 and given to his granddaughter last October, the media outlet said. On paper, they were listed as amounts to a person named “Ryan Elisabeth.” It was later learned that the recipient was actually Ryan Elisabeth Reid, 23, who's the daughter of Mr. Reid's son, Rory, the New York Post said.
A journalist from Las Vegas actually contacted Mr. Reid's office to ask about the “Ryan Elisabeth” payments and was told that the individual was a campaign vendor — but was not told that she was Mr. Reid's granddaughter, the New York Post said. Mr. Reid's office than said that the checks were actually for purchases from “Ryan Elisabeth's” jewelry shop to give out to donors of Mr. Reid's campaign.
The full truth of the matter came to light when the FEC contacted Mr. Reid's campaign and reminded that all disbursements “must include a brief statement or description” and that failure to do so could “result in an audit or enforcement action,” the New York Post reported.
Mr. Reid said on Wednesday that “we complied with all the rules,” the New York Post reported. But at the same time, he said he was going to reimburse the money to his campaign.

A protest calling for an end to a ban on topless sunbathing turned into a farce when fewer than a dozen of the 2,000 women who had pledged to take their tops off during the demonstration turned up.
The very few who did take part in the protest on Rio de Janeiro's Ipanema beach were instead met by hundreds of men and photographers who descended on the beach on Saturday morning to witness the event.

According to the BBC, organisers said the majority of the women who had claimed they were going to attend but failed to show probably felt too intimidated.
Organisers said it was a pity the event became a media circus (Picture: Reuters)
‘It is a pity it became a media circus. What really amazes me is the number of men who came here just to see women's chests,' organiser Ana Rios said.

Protesters argue the current legislation is out of date and point to the fact nudity is tolerated during Rio's annual carnival.

Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination at universities receiving federal funds, requires universities to treat sexual assault as a form of sex discrimination. But sexual assault is much more than sex discrimination: it is a heinous crime. The problem of sexual assault on campus is finally getting much-needed attention, but too many of the current recommendations rely on universities' internal disciplinary systems.
Only our criminal justice system can properly protect the accuser and the accused — and punish those found guilty accordingly.
This is the wrong approach. To ensure that sexual assault is treated like the crime it is, law enforcement must take the lead. Only our criminal justice system can properly protect the accuser and the accused — and punish those found guilty accordingly.
Currently, internal university proceedings are used both to provide Title IX remedies to the alleged victim (such as changes in dorm assignments and class schedules, no-contact orders and so forth) and to adjudicate an accused student's guilt or innocence.
In these proceedings, accused students are routinely denied the most basic elements of due process, such as the right to see the evidence against them and the right to confront, even indirectly, the accuser. Not only is this terribly unfair to students accused of serious wrongdoing, but it undermines the integrity of the process in a way that harms everyone involved.
Moreover, since all a university can do is expel a student it finds responsible for sexual assault, relying on university disciplinary systems to adjudicate such claims means that universities are simply releasing people they deem dangerous back into the larger society, where they are free to continue their behavior.
For the sake of everyone involved, universities should focus on providing support — including Title IX remedies — to the alleged victims of sexual assault, and should coordinate with law enforcement to maximize the chances that rapists will end up in jail, where they belong.

How social are these mega social networks? Well social enough for Facebook to have courted Twitter most recently...to only be rebuffed as a lustful suitor too eager to get to third base before the first pitch was thrown. Back in fall of 2008, Facebook offered Twitter $500 million in stock to wed and bed her.
However, the deal broke down when Twitter assessed that the dowry Facebook was presenting might not actually be worth the paper it was written on. While some sources at Facebook said CEO Mark Zuckerberg was becoming envious of the buzz Twitter was attracting, across the Internet–a space that heretofore was dominated by Facebook.
On the flip of things, if Facebook was so enamored with Twitter's cache how did it overlook some its obvious flaws? After all, Twitter for all its success in viral marketing is still floundering in the red. In fact, presently there are more expenses on the balance sheet than there is revenue.For those not familiar, the premise of Twitter is based on the simple business mode of microblogging where, a registered user logs onto the Internet or a mobile phone and answers only one basic question: “What are you doing?” The only requirement for the sender is that they accomplish that "tweet" in 140 characters or fewer! The onus then falls on their brethren tweeps whether they respond favorably or otherwise…or just ignore it altogether!
And based on that very basic premise, investors are very enthusiastic about Twitter, and have already handed over $20 million for the start-up. Twitter now valued at $98 million includes investors such as Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures, Digital Garage, Spark Capital, Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and Silicon Valley guru Marc Andreessen, founder of Ning.com. Interestingly, Andreessen is also on Facebook's board….talk about having your cake and eat it too!On the revenue side, Twitter has been exploring options like charging business customers and adding advertising onto their consumer platform. One of the most recent examples of companies benefiting commercially from Twitter is Dell Computes who reportedly made $1 million in sales during the holidays by microblogging on Twitter, and recently started giving discounts exclusively to its Twitter followers. Seems to me, the executive board at Twitter would be anxious to get a cut of that action!Lack of revenues was an issue for Facebook, said sources referring to what Twitter pays for delivery of its messages to cell phones. So if Twitter's 6 million users were to merge with Facebook's 175 million active users, Facebook execs estimated that it might have to deal with huge SMS fees–up to $75 million annually.At first blush, with the numbers so high on the Facebook side, it appears that Facebook may actually be the Goliath to Twitter's David. However, if that be the case, the slingshot that Twitter is wielding might actually be a disguised WMD, based on the recent traffic numbers. Over the course of the last year, traffic to Twitter, used by celebrities as famous as US president Barack Obama, has increased by 1191 per cent, while visitors to Facebook paled in comparison with a 110% rise (according to industry analysts Hitwise ). With stats, like these, it begs the question: Is Twitter in the passing lane, with Facebook in its rearview mirror?No one knows just where Facebook is headed or whether it's serious about dominating the social media landscape, particularly after the outrage it caused when it tried to change its Terms Of Service . It's easy for bloggers to speculate that with every new app and every incremental change to its platform, that such a plan has been set in motion, but to date there is no concrete evidence. Mike Butcher at TechCrunch UK believes that Facebook has a fundamentally different relationship model than Twitter. On Facebook, you create a simple two-way friendship with someone. On Twitter, you can choose to follow someone and you can be followed, but the subsequent relationship doesn't have to be bidirectional.In my humble opinion, Twitter has a leg up on Facebook in its control over the media. To me, I view Twitter as the 21Century version of the town crier. Where Facebook, doesn't break the news, Twitter is fast becoming the place to be to get your most updated news blurbs before it hits the mainstream media outlets. News stories like the recent “Google malware fiasco” or the “imposter Dalai Lama” are prime examples of how the buzz starts with Twitter and then spills over into the traditional channels. Why… some people are irreverent enough to believe that God needs to start following Twitter!For now, a marriage between Twitter and Facebook doesn't spell out kismet. Perhaps, the courtship between the two Web 2.0 sweethearts could be rekindled sometime in the future. After all, when one party is only 5 years old and the other is just turning 3, an arranged wedding might be a wee bit premature. Maybe the match-up between the two Goliaths is in its early stages of a "Harry Met Sally" relationship, and it needs time to mature before it can become a true and lasting bond. As in Twitter, you can be "followed" and you can be a "follower", but it takes a true seasoned member of the twitterati to be both!
By now you are probably aware of the major flooding that happened over the last several days in Missouri. Larry Lazar gave us a guest post detailing his personal experiences in Eureka, where the flooding was extensive. This flooding is not over, but is simply moving down stream in the Mississippi watershed. It will take several days before this is over.
We are long past the days when one can honestly say “you can't attribute a given weather event to climate change.” Climate is weather long term, and weather is climate in the here and now. Climate has changed because of anthropogenic global warming. It is simply incorrect to say that the two are unrelated.
With a warmer atmosphere, there is more water vapor aloft. Changes in the relationship between the tropics and the Arctic, that relationship being a key determinate in how weather works, have changed how weather patterns develop. These changes cause precipitation to clump up, so some areas get more than the usual amount of rain while other areas experience less. These changes have also slowed down the movement of storms, so wet weather hangs around longer in one area.
More rain, clumped, and slowed down, means more frequent and more severe flooding, and we have seen plenty of that this past year, and a general increase over the last couple of decades. The increase in severity and frequency of flooding that was manifest just now in Missouri is the result of human caused disruption of atmospheric systems and this chaotic weather literally rains down on us from that atmosphere.
Tim Jones is no longer in elected office, yet continues to indicate that he is on his Twitter page.
Now we turn to an irony, and an exemplar of an important and troubling phenomenon. The irony is that one small piece of the loss of property this flooding caused in Missouri was severe damage to the campaign headquarters of former Missouri House representative (District 110) Timothy Jones. Jones is a long time climate science denier. He is no longer in elected office, by his own choice, but Jones wrote that as he plans “… to continue my public service in the future, I am keeping all options open for 2018 and beyond to serve our state and our nation.” That facility is also used, according to Jones and others, to host Republican political meetings and events.
That is the irony, obviously, but I'll develop the ironic nature of this small event more in a bit. The phenomenon that is so troubling is the concerted effort of politicians and others to work against addressing climate change. This is not a new thing. The fossil fuel industry, large players such as the Koch brothers, and famous politicians such as Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe have been working to discredit climate science and stop the shift towards clean (non-fossil) fuels for decades. Tim Jones has been and is a local player in that effort.
Let me be clear. We knew about climate change decades ago. In the 1970s, we also learned how precarious our national security and economic system can be in its reliance on fossil fuels.
There was a brief time back in the 70s when efficiency in fuel use was seen as a good thing, even a necessary thing. There were changes in zoning laws, speed limits on our interstates, automobile efficiency standards, appliance efficiency ratings, and all that. But around the same time and subsequently, “green” approaches to energy, slower speed limits, efficiency in building practices, and the development of solar and wind energy became conservative (read: Republican) issues but not in a good way.
As our nation transformed into not just a two party system, but a two ideology system, the right has taken up the challenge, effectively, of putting the kibosh on pretty much every move an individual, company, industry, public agency, or government might make to meaningfully reduce the use of fossil fuels and, in so doing, reduce our contribution to ever-increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere.
Imagine for a moment what might have happened if we treated both energy and climate change using that good old fashioned American approach that gave us victory over fascism in World War II, the Manhattan Project (for better or worse), and several trips to the moon. After 40 years of effort, leading the world in similar efforts, we would not be at 400+ parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere. Simply put, had we stepped up back when we first realized the need and benefits of so doing, we would not have be experiencing the climate disruption we are now experiencing.
Today's climate disruption was underwritten by, enhanced by – really, caused by – climate change science deniers and green energy opponents like Tim Jones and his ilk. They didn't just question the science or make a fair stab at supporting oil and coal interests. They made disruptive climate change happen.
So, when Tim Jones finds his vaguely labeled headquarters destroyed by a flood that would have been unlikely decades ago but that today is virtually inevitable, and that will repeat frequently, it is all about chickens. What kind of chicken? The kind that occasionally come home. To roost.
I would not have even noticed that Jones' headquarters had been destroyed had he not done something that is astonishingly insensitive and inappropriate. Jones is a popular and powerful Republican, statewide, in Missouri. He has raised a lot of money. As of January 2015 Jones had nearly one million dollars in his campaign coffers. Given the ruined status of his headquarters, it would be a simple matter to fund repair and renovations beyond whatever insurance coverage he had on the place. But instead of simply paying the piper that he himself helped invite to the party, he started a Go Fund Me campaign so that his supporters, who had suffered through this flood, could pay for those repairs.
Tim Jones' Go Fund Me campaign is a poignant reminder of the situation. He has denied the human role in climate, he now denies that the flood that destroyed his offices is related to climate change, and now he is denying responsibility for the fiscal loss.
He is asking his former constituents and current supporters, who themselves have lost about two dozen loved ones and family members to flood related deaths and as yet uncounted millions of dollars in property, to buy him some new drywall. What a guy.
But wait, there's more. Tim Jones has left public office for now, though he may return. But what is he doing exactly?
At the time that he announced he would no longer be seeking election, Jones accepted a job as a senior policy fellow with the Hammond Institute for Free Enterprise, housed at Lindenwood University. Lindenwood announced, within a day of Jones' announcement that he would be joining Hammond, the award of a $2 million grant from … wait for it … the Charles Koch Foundation.
Meanwhile, since the flood, Jones has been making quite a stink on his Twitter feed, calling people who understand that climate change is real and important various names such as “Eco-Nazi,” “Libnuts,” etc. These offensive tweets are not important … that's what people do on Twitter. But seeing them interspersed with tweets begging for donations to fix up his headquarters is more than a little annoying, knowing that he has about a million bucks in the bank.
I contacted Larry Lazar, who wrote the personal account of flooding in Eureka I mention above, to get his impression of Jones and related matters.
First I wanted to know if Larry had any inkling as to why Jones, if he is not in office, still uses the title “speaker” as part of his Twitter handle. Larry told me that a friend of his opined, “He doesn't want to relinquish the title just as a President doesn't lose his/her title. I saw this in a Twitter conversation with him and someone else months ago.” This makes sense given some of his tweets today, in which he announced the development, at his flooded headquarters, of a sort of “Tim Jones Library.” Imagine that.
In one of his Tweets, Jones suggested that those concerned with climate change quiet down and go away, noting that the flood had happened five days ago and was no big deal. I asked Larry how he felt to learn that the state rep who formerly represented him indicated that the flood was not an important event. He told me,
My immediate thought upon seeing his flood damaged office was “What will it take for him to get it?” Tim has been an outspoken denier of climate science since he has been in office. While he has no expertise in climate science he has shared his views in opposition of climate science for many years via conservative radio and social media like Twitter and Facebook.
I should be shocked, but I know Tim's opposition to climate change science all too well as he has been very active on conservative radio and social media – like twitter. I wasstill surprised that he could be so insensitive given all of the devastation that our community and many others in Missouri have experienced. Most of these folks are uninsured and don't have financial resources available to them like the wealthy do. I thought he could at least pretend to be concerned about the folks, many of whom have voted for him and supported him financially, thathavemay have lost their homes andother property.
Let's look at the bigger picture for a moment. Missouri is a pretty red state. How well a clean energy project does in a given state has a lot to do with the legislature and prevailing powerful interests. I was wondering what was going on in Missouri in this area. I asked Larry if the Missouri state government, where Tim Jones and a lot of similar minded Republicans have served or do serve to represent the people, has been doing what it needs to do to make it easier for individual citizens and companies to use cleaner energy sources. Larry gave me a long and thoughtful answer to that question, which I'll pass on in its entirety.
Missouri gets 80% of our energy from dirty coal - which is imported from Wyoming. Neighboring states like Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska are harnessing renewable energy sources at much higher rates than Missouri. I often wonder if the fact that St. Louis is the world headquarters for 5 coal companies, including Peabody, the world's largest coal company, contributes to our continued reliance on coal. Peabody, as well as Ameren, which is Missouri's largest energy utility, are both large contributors to political campaigns – for both parties. The result of this unholy alliance is that Missouri has very few incentives, both at the individual, and corporate levels, to switch to cleaner energy. I wish Missouri could lead on climate. If only Missouri leaders would recognize the great economic opportunities that exist for entrepreneurs, businesses and individuals by leading on climate change instead of clinging to denial that, frankly, is absurd. We have outstanding scientific expertise in our universities and businesses as well as hard-working and intelligent people. Why not leverage these resources and put Missouri in a leadership position on climate? Let Missourians go to work on climate. We can solve this - and Missouri should lead. I would also ask Missouri leaders to reflect on what their legacy will be. In 20, 30 or 50 years what will their children and grandchildren say about them? What will be in the history books about what actions they took, or didn't take, on climate change and other issues back in the early decades of the 21st century? Did they act upon what many scientists say is humankind's greatest challenge or did they persist in denial and delay, apparently for the benefit of a few exceptionally wealthy contributors to their campaigns?
Thanks to Larry Lazar for his help in figuring this all out, and thanks to Tim Jones for being such a great example of what is wrong with this country.
Oh by the way: Republican Politics in Missouri
Not directly related to the issue at hand, but very relevant to the state of Republican politics in the Show Me state, is this pair of suicides and related political intriquge, antisemitism, and as Rachel Meadow calls it, Shakespearian Tragedy. This is the first story in the March 30th, 2015 Rachel Maddow Show:
On 9 April 1413, Henry V was crowned king of England. But how should we remember him: as a conquering hero who helped put the great into Great Britain; or a warmonger who led his country into a futile war of foreign conquest?
It snowed heavily in London on the day that Henry was crowned over 600 years ago. Writing a few years later, but before the king died in 1422, Thomas Walsingham, the resident chronicler at St Albans Abbey, recalled two interpretations of this unseasonable weather. Some thought it portended that the king would be cold hearted and rule his subjects harshly; others took it as an omen that vice would be frozen and new virtues would flourish in the coming spring. Both were correct. Walsingham may even have introduced the rival interpretations of the omen to make a veiled criticism of the king. Yes, he had brought a new beginning, a restoration of law and order and a revival of military success. But as the reign had progressed, he had become increasingly arbitrary in his actions and rapacious in his demands. How would it all end?
And in a similar way over the centuries historians have continued to disagree about Henry. On one side he has been characterised as the greatest man who ever ruled England; a national hero; the exemplification of the chivalric ideal; the man who came closer than any other to embodying the contemporary ideal of the just king; a ruler who possessed all the characteristics expected of a medieval monarch and more – a charismatic leader, a brilliant soldier, and a gifted administrator. On the other hand, he has been described as a fanatic, cruel, sadistic, sanctimonious, priggish, a hypocrite and a warmonger.
2015 saw the six hundredth anniversary of his famous victory at Agincourt and brought forth the question, should we celebrate him as one of our greatest kings, or should we remember him as a ruler who led his kingdom astray in the vain pursuit of power and glory? Six hundred years ago England was a little country on the edge of the continent that punched above its weight in European affairs. Does Henry V's brief and spectacular reign hold any lessons for Britain's role in Europe today?

The age of the drone is here, and U.S. intelligence agencies are warily monitoring their proliferation around the globe.
China uses them to spy on Japan near disputed islands in Asia. Turkey uses them to eyeball Kurdish activity in northern Iraq. Bolivia uses them to spot coca fields in the Andes. Iran reportedly has given them to Syria to monitor opposition rebels.
The U.S., Britain and Israel are the only nations to have fired missiles from remote-controlled drones, but the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles has become so prevalent that U.S. intelligence sources and private analysts say it is merely a matter of time before other countries use the technology.
“People in Washington like to talk about this as if the supposed American monopoly on drones might end one day. Well, the monopoly ended years ago,” said Peter W. Singer, who heads the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution.
What's worse, clandestine strikes carried out by Washington in far-flung corners of the world have set a precedent that could be ugly.
Mr. Singer said as many as 87 nations possess some form of drones and conduct various kinds of surveillance either over their own territories or beyond. Among those 87, he said, 26 have either purchased or developed drones equivalent in size to the MQ-1 Predator — the model made by San Diego-based General Atomics.
While American Predators and their updated sister, the MQ-9 Reaper, are capable of carrying anti-armor Hellfire missiles, the clandestine nature of foreign drone programs makes it difficult to determine how many other nations have armed drones.
Defense industry and other sources who spoke with The Washington Times said 10 to 15 nations are thought to be working hard on doing just that, and China and Iran are among those with the most advanced programs.
“Global developments in the UAV arena are being tracked closely,” said one U.S. intelligence official, who spoke with The Times on the condition of anonymity. “Efforts by some countries to acquire armed UAV systems are concerning, not least because of the associated proliferation risk.”
Other sources said that while the international media have focused on the controversy and political backlash associated with civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, Washington's unprecedented success with the technology — both in targeting and killing suspected terrorists — has inspired a new kind of arms race.
“It's natural that other nations and non-state actors, seeing the many ways the U.S. has leveraged the technology, are keen to acquire remotely piloted aircraft,” said Lt. Gen. Robert P. Otto, Air Force deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.
Race to the skies
The number of nations possessing drones nearly doubled from 41 to 76 from 2005 to 2011, according to a report last year by the Government Accountability Office, which highlighted the fact that U.S. companies are no longer alone in manufacturing and marketing the technology.
“Many countries acquired their UAVs from Israel,” said the report.
It said Germany, France, Britain, India, Russia and Georgia have either leased or purchased Israeli drones, including the Heron, a model that many foreign militaries see as a good alternative to the American-made Predators and Reapers.
A report this year by Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace and defense industry analysis corporation, said UAVs have come to represent the “most dynamic growth sector” of the global aerospace industry, with spending on drones projected to more than double from roughly $5.2 billion a year today to more than $11 billion in 2022.
China is widely seen as a potential powerhouse in the market.
Chinese companies have “marketed both armed drones and weapons specifically designed for UAV use,” said Steven J. Zaloga, a top analyst at Teal Group. “It's a case where if they don't have the capability today, they'll have it soon.”
Although there is concern in Washington that China will sell the technology to American adversaries, sources say, the U.S. also is pushing ahead with development of its own secretive “next generation” drones.
Today's models emerged in the post-9/11 era of nonconventional conflict — a time when American use of both weaponized and surveillance-only drones has been almost exclusively over chaotic patches of the planet void of traditional anti-aircraft defenses.
With little or no need to hide, relatively bulky drones such as the MQ-1 Predator dominated the market. But the “big secret,” Mr. Zaloga said, “is that the U.S. is already working on both armed and unarmed UAVs that can operate in defended airspace.”
Another factor likely to fuel the proliferation of armed drones, he said, centers on a global push to make “very small weapons” that can be tailored to fit smaller aircraft. This matters because of the roughly 20,000 drones now in existence, only about 350 are large enough to carry the slate of weapons on the current market.
“What the new munitions will do is mean that if you're operating the smaller UAVs, you'll be able to put weapons on them,” said Mr. Zaloga. “And those smaller UAVs are being manufactured now by quite a few countries.”
In the wrong hands?
One serious concern in Washington is that smaller drones could be used by groups such as al Qaeda or Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant and political organization based in Lebanon that is engaged in a protracted war with Israel.
The U.S. intelligence official who spoke with The Times on the condition of anonymity said it is “getting easier for non-state actors to acquire this technology.”
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah made headlines by claiming his group flew a drone into Israeli airspace last year, after Israel announced that it had shot a UAV out of the sky. Although Mr. Nasrallah said the drone was made in Iran and assembled in Lebanon, little is known about precisely what type it was — or whether it was armed.
Armed or not, U.S. officials are wary. “No one is turning a blind eye to the growing use of surveillance-only UAV systems — including by non-state actors — even if these systems have a host of beneficial civil applications,” said the official who spoke with The Times. “One problem is that countries may perceive these systems as less provocative than armed platforms and might use them in cross-border operations in a way that actually stokes regional tension.”
That appears to be happening in Asia, where Japan recently threatened to shoot down Chinese drones flying near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.
Northeast Asian countries are likely to invest heavily in drone technology, said Patrick M. Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.
“But even before these investments are manifested in wider deployments, Japan will be relying on UAVs for wider and better surveillance, particularly around its southwest island chain, while China will be using them to variably challenge Japanese administrative control and, indirectly, pressure the United States to restrain its ally,” said Mr. Cronin. “This vital new technology is improving situational awareness. But, paradoxically, if used more offensively the same technology may also accelerate a maritime crisis in the East or even South China Sea.”
U.S. precedents
Others say the U.S. and its closest allies have set a precedent with clandestine drone strikes in foreign lands. Although British forces have carried out hundreds of drone strikes in Afghanistan and Israel has used drone-fired missiles to kill suspected terrorists in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, as well as Islamic militants in Gaza, the most widespread use has been directed by the U.S. military and CIA.
In addition to strikes in Libya and Somalia, the U.S. has carried out more than 375 strikes in Pakistan and as many as 65 in Yemen over the past nine years, according to the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The concern, said the Brookings Institution's Mr. Singer, is that adversaries will point to U.S. behavior as an excuse for carrying out cross-border targeting of “high-value” individuals.
“That's where you have the problem,” he said. “Turkey carries out a strike in northern Iraq and then cites U.S. precedent in Pakistan to justify it. Or Iran carries out a drone strike inside Syria that the Syrian government says it's fine with because it's a lawless area where what they call ‘terrorists' are hanging out, and then they throw the precedent back at the U.S.
“That would make it sticky for us,” said Mr. Singer. “That's not the broader norm we want out there.”

The activities planned for Sol 1609 went well, and MAHLI focus data indicate that high-resolution images of Perry were successfully acquired. So we're ready to drive away from Ireson Hill after some more remote sensing of the rocks in front of the rover. The Sol 1610 plan starts with some more drill diagnostic tests, then the arm will be moved out of the way for remote sensing. ChemCam and Right Mastcam will observe a bedrock exposure named "Fogelin" that shows subtle color variations , and Mastcam will acquire multispectral sets of images of yesterday's contact science targets Perry and Spurwink. As more Sol 1609 data were returned during planning this morning, the Mastcam team noticed that the Right Mastcam image of Edmunds was blocked by the arm, so this activity will be repeated on Sol 1610 with the arm out of the way. Mastcam will also measure dust in the atmosphere before the drive and standard post-drive imaging. Later in the afternoon, Navcam will search for dust devils and clouds, and ChemCam will acquire some calibration data. REMS will take a break from the usual environmental monitoring to update their flight software.
Lebanese General Jean Kahwaj has ordered his troops on high alert, cautioning soldiers on the border region to prepare for an attack from Israel, according to published reports.
The comments first appeared in London-based Arabic language newspaper Alquds Alarabi, according to the Jerusalem Post.
“In a statement published in honor of Lebanon's Independence Day, the general said soldiers should prepare ‘to handle what the Israeli enemy is scheming against the homeland, and to continue the battle against its violations – in the air, water, and land – with all the tools at our disposal,'” Ynet noted.
“Last week, a military court in Lebanon sentenced a Lebanese soldier and his wife to death, after the couple were found guilty of spying for Israel, Israel Radio reported,” the Post added. “The court also sentenced the defendant's sister and her husband, who are reportedly living in Israel, to death.”
Ynet continued: “IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi recently warned the Knesset that Hezbollah is currently armed with thousands of missiles, some of which could reach the southern city of Dimona.”
Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather is predicting that some Republicans could defect from President Trump if his poll numbers slip below 30 percent.
"They're afraid that he may have indeed committed some impeachable offense, and also they're hearing from home that a lot of their constituents have increasing concerns about the Trump presidency," Rather told CNN's Don Lemon.
"As long as he's able to hold that 35, 38 poll rating – you may not see that, but I repeat for emphasis, once it gets down below 30 percent, you'll see some Republicans going the other way," said the longtime host.

Despite being saddled with a steady stream of controversies and consistently low approval ratings in his first months in office, Trump has largely maintained the backing of GOP lawmakers.
Trump's approval rating currently sits at 39 percent, according to a Real Clear Politics average of presidential job approval ratings. Among Republicans, his approval rating is much higher.
The president has faced mounting controversies, particularly related to the ongoing law enforcement investigation into Russian election meddling and possible collusion between his election campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly called the probe a "witch hunt" and has denied any wrongdoing.
The latest controversy came on Thursday, when fired FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that Trump had once asked him in private conversation for a pledge of loyalty and then to drop the bureau's investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanBrexit and exit: A transatlantic comparison Five takeaways from McCabe's allegations against Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Sanders set to shake up 2020 race MORE (R-Wis.), acknowledged that the president's requests may have been inappropriate, but defended his actions as rookie mistakes – the result of Trump's lack of government experience.
But some of Trump's highest-profile policies have spurred backlash, as well. His decision last week to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, for example, sparked nationwide protests and prompted vows by numerous business leaders, governors and mayors to uphold the agreement in spite of Trump's announcement.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in the wake of Trump's decision found that nearly six in 10 Americans oppose withdrawing from the climate deal.
Dan Todd, Arkane studios level designer, confirmed on the Bethesda official forums that the upcoming game Dishonored will have a play through time of longer than 22 hours. While replying to a forum user he posted:
My ghost and no kills play through took 22 hours. That's without exploring every nook and cranny, and knowing the solution to everything beforehand. It should take more thorough / inexperienced players a bit longer than that
Note that in Dishonored you can complete our objectives in various ways so that also adds to the replay -ability of the game and its longevity. More than 22 hours for an action game is a quite big figure in this day and age especially, don't you think so?

Unless the Fed is going to start buying millions of homes outright, prices are going to fall to what buyers can afford.
There are two generalities that can be applied to all asset bubbles:
1. Bubbles inflate for longer and reach higher levels than most pre-bubble analysts expected
2. All bubbles burst, despite mantra-like claims that "this time it's different"
The bubble burst tends to follow a symmetrical reversal of very similar time durations and magnitudes as the initial rise. If the bubble took four years to inflate and rose by X, to retrace tends to take about the same length of time and tends to retrace much or all of X.
If we look at the chart of the Case-Shiller Housing Index below, this symmetry is visible in Housing Bubble #1 which skyrocketed from 2003-2007 and burst from 2008-2012.
Housing Bubble #1 wasn't allowed to fully retrace the bubble, as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to near-zero in 2009 and bought $1+ trillion in sketchy mortgage-backed securities (MBS), essentially turning America's mortgage market into a branch of the central bank and federal agency guarantors of mortgages (Fannie and Freddie, VA, FHA).
These unprecedented measures stopped the bubble decline by instantly making millions of people who previously could not qualify for a privately originated mortgage qualified buyers. This vast expansion of the pool of buyers (expanded by a flood of buyers from China and other hot-money locales) drove sales and prices higher for six years (2012-2018).
As noted on the chart below, this suggests the bubble burst will likely run from 2019-2025, give or take a few quarters.
The question is: what's the likely magnitude of the decline? Scenario 1 (blue line) is a symmetrical repeat of Housing Bubble #2: a retraced of the majority of the bubble's rise but not 100%, which reverses off this somewhat higher base to start Housing Bubble #3.
Since the mainstream consensus denies the possibility that Housing Bubble #2 even exists (perish the thought that real estate prices could ever--gasp--drop), they most certainly deny the possibility that prices could retrace much of the gains since 2012.
More realistic analysts would probably agree that if the current slowdown (never say recession, it might cost you your job) gathers momentum, some decline in housing prices is possible. They would likely agree with Scenario 1 that any such decline would be modest and would simply set the stage for an even grander housing bubble #3.
But there is a good case for Scenario 2, in which price plummets below the 2012 lows and keeps on going, ultimately retracing the entire housing bubble gains from 2003.
Why is Scenario 2 not just possible but likely? There are no more "saves" in the Fed's locker. Dropping interest rates to zero and buying another trillion in MBS won't have the same positive effects they had in 2009-2018. Those policies have run their course.
Among independent analysts, Chris Hamilton is a must-read for his integration of demographics and economics. Please read (via Zero Hedge) Demographics, Debt, & Debasement: A Picture Of American Insolvency if you want to understand why near-zero interest rates and buying mortgage-backed securities isn't going to spark Housing Bubble #3.
Millennials are burdened with $1 trillion in student loans and most don't earn enough to afford a home at today's nosebleed prices. When the Fed drops the Fed Funds Rate to zero, it doesn't follow that mortgage rates drop to zero. They drop a bit, but not enough to transform an unaffordable house into an affordable one.
Buying up $1 trillion in sketchy mortgages worked in 2009 because it bailed out everyone who was at risk of absorbing huge losses as a percentage of those mortgages defaulted. The problem now isn't one of liquidity or iffy mortgages: it's the generation that would like to buy homes finds they don't earn enough, and their incomes are not secure enough, to gamble everything on an overpriced house that chains them to a local economy they might want to leave if opportunities arise elsewhere.
In other words, the economy has changed, and the sacrifices required to buy a house in hot markets at today's prices make no sense. The picture changes, of course, in areas where 2X or 3X a typical income will buy a house, and 1X a pretty good income will buy a house.
Unless the Fed is going to start buying millions of homes outright, prices are going to fall to what buyers can afford. As China's debt bubble implodes, the Chinese buyers with cash (probably not even cash, just money borrowed in China's vast unregulated Shadow Banking System) who have propped up dozens of markets from France to Vancouver will vanish, leaving only the unwealthy as buyers.
The only question of any real interest is how low prices will drop by 2025. We're so accustomed to being surprised on the upside that we've forgotten we can surprise on the downside as well.

America teeters on the precipice: our government is now captive to special interests and big money, twin cancers that threaten our democracy. This accelerating crisis is exacerbated by a toxic social media-fueled tribalism that has replaced what do you think? with which side are you on?
Our crisis isnt just politicalits structural: as the pace of change explodes from gradual to non-linear, the organizations that dominate our economycentralized corporations and governmentbecome destined to fail. We see this failure in both the soaring inequality that has hollowed out the American Dream and in the rising tide of social and political disunity.
To prevent the fall of our democratic republic, we must transform our economy and society from the ground up. As we enter a new era of rapid, unprecedented tumult, it is we citizens who will need to save our democracy. For our political and financial elites will cling to their centralized power, doing more of whats failed, even as civil society unravels.
All is not lost--yet. Our way forward starts with understanding the fatal flaws of our brittle, self-serving status quo and embracing this basic truth: better options are available if were willing to explore.
To pathfind our way to a better destiny, we must create new localized structures optimized for resilience and adaptabilitya flexible, decentralized, sustainable, democratic, opportunity-for-all nation.

Getty Feds seize control of D.C.'s Metrorail safety
Federal regulators are taking control of safety oversight for Washington, D.C.'s troubled Metrorail system, a sharp indictment of problems the agency hasn't been able to get a handle on for years.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the Federal Transit Administration will immediately assert its authority over the rail system until D.C., Maryland and Virginia establish a functional oversight body. FTA's powers will include the ability to conduct unannounced inspections, and to order the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to spend federal money to correct problems.
Story Continued Below
The enhanced federal oversight will continue until D.C., Maryland and Virginia establish an “compliant and capable” agency to oversee safety, which is now handled by a body called the Tri-State Oversight Committee.
“WMATA must also immediately hire a capable General Manager who is able to correct the course at the transit agency,” Foxx wrote.
In a statement, Metro Interim General Manager and CEO Jack Requa said WMATA will keep working with FTA to correct safety concerns and is “fully engaged” in implementing actions to rectify them.
“We appreciate Secretary Foxx's continued support and his leadership on safety oversight,” he said.
By ridership, WMATA is the second largest transit system in the country. Its problems include a January incident in which a Metro rail car filled with smoke in January, killing one passenger at the L'Enfant Plaza station, but it has also taken heavy criticism for a host of maintenance woes.
Foxx's announcement came in a letter to Christopher Hart, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which had recommended that the department take an even more dramatic step: shift federal safety responsibilities for Metro from FTA to the Federal Railroad Administration.
"We agree that the [Tri-State Oversight Committee], as currently established, is ineffective," Foxx wrote. "We disagree, however, that the best, most urgent and most effective solution is to transfer safety oversight of WMATA's rail transit system to the Federal Railroad Administration."
Congress granted FTA enhanced safety authority in the 2012 transportation bill, allowing it to step in when state oversight agencies responsible for transit safety are ineffective, Foxx said. FTA has already issued a safety directive to WMATA and "will now directly enforce and investigate" safety oversight of the agency's rail function, he said.
"By contrast, the NTSB recommendation shifts oversight from one agency to another one, creating confusion and a greater risk of slowing down improvements," Foxx said. "More practically, WMATA does not have an understanding or familiarity with FRA regulations, and separating their rail and bus oversight into different regulatory structures would confuse and likely delay safety improvements."
Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in a statement that she and Foxx appear to be “on the same page,” though she plans to continue working on legislative language addressing the NTSB recommendation that could come up during debate on a multi-year highway and transit bill later this month.
“The FTA may be able to proceed on its own, but I will continue to work with my Republican colleagues and the Administration on appropriate language to be included in the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization bill,” she said.

India had requested Interpol "Red Corner" notices against the five after questioning David Headley, the US-born son of a former Pakistan i diplomat, who pleaded guilty in Chicago to helping to plan the attacks.
Headley had helped to identify the voices of the men who guided the militants during their assault on three hotels and a Jewish community centre in Mumbai which left 166 dead, the Press Trust of India reported.
According to the report, Headley identified Sajid Majid as the person who instructed the militants holding Israelis hostage in the Jewish centre.
He also said a Major Iqbal had provided him with funds and training. He also named another officer, Major Sameer Ali.
The other two men named in the warrants were Illyas Kashmiri and Syed Abdur Rahman Hashim, a retired army major.
A Red Corner notice seeks the arrest or provisional arrest of wanted persons with a view to extradition.
G. K. Pillai, Indian Home Secretary, accused Pakistan's military intelligence wing of "controlling and coordinating" the Mumbai attacks in an interview in July with the Indian Express newspaper. Pakistan denied the allegation.
Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks, was sentenced to death by an Indian court in May. He has appealed against the sentence.
The Pittsburgh Penguins have named Mark Recchi player development coach, it was announced today by executive vice president and general manager Jim Rutherford.
Recchi, 46, will be responsible for working with and assisting in the development of young prospects and players throughout the Penguins' organization in the minor leagues as well as in junior and college hockey.
Recchi, a Kamloops, British Columbia native, was the Penguins' fourth-round draft pick in 1988. He scored 154 goals and 385 points in 389 games over three different stints in Pittsburgh.
In 1990-91, Recchi led the Penguins in scoring during the regular season with 40 goals and 113 points in 78 games – then added 10 goals and 34 points in 24 playoff games as the Penguins captured their first Stanley Cup.
Recchi played in 1,652 games in a 22-year NHL career with the Penguins, Philadelphia, Montreal, Carolina, Atlanta, Tampa Bay and Boston. He retired in 2011 after registering 577 goals and 956 assists for 1,533 points. He also won Stanley Cups with Carolina and Boston.
Recchi, who lives in Pittsburgh, has spent the past two years involved with the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite youth hockey program. During that period he was also a senior advisor in the Dallas Stars organization.

Over the past few weeks, we've gotten notes from Verge Science readers wondering why news from the incoming Trump administration has seeped into our science coverage. I wasn't surprised: it's tempting to believe that science is apolitical. But science and politics are plainly related: science is the pursuit of knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is politics.
The scientific method consists of generating a hypothesis, attempting to disprove the hypothesis through testing, and accumulating those tests to come up with shared knowledge. And that method also contains ideology: our observed, shared world is the real world. This ideology even has a name: empiricism. An incoming president who clearly picks and chooses facts to suit his own version of the world changes the relationship between science and culture, in potentially destructive ways.
Science is the pursuit of knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is politics
Surrounding the scientific method is a more obviously political arena: money. Much of American basic science — the kind of stuff that leads to advances like CRISPR — is funded by the government. Entities such as the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation are the biggest funders of science in the US; all use public money. Decisions about funding allocation are made by politicians. We may choose to spend more money on defense instead of cancer, for instance, or choose to fund addiction research rather than a new NASA mission. Deciding what science we find valuable is not a scientific decision. It's a political one. The very idea that the US government should support American science by funding research at all is deeply political.
We've also made political decisions about what research we won't do, because although they might increase knowledge, we've deemed them harmful. That's why institutional review boards exist: to protect patients from unethical experimentation. There was a time when this idea was not widely accepted, and it led, in America, to unethical experimentation on vulnerable citizens. Henrietta Lacks' cells — the famous HeLa cells that were used to develop the polio vaccine — were unethically gathered and studied. The Tuskegee syphilis research denied black men adequate treatment for the disease, though it was available, under the guise of learning more about the long-term effects of syphilis. These Americans were used as test subjects without their informed consent — something we no longer allow. And these ethical decisions sometimes change with elections: George W. Bush created the President's Council on Bioethics and tightly restricted stem cell research, while Barack Obama dissolved the group and lifted those restrictions.
Ethical decisions sometimes change with elections
Then there's the matter of what to do with scientific results, which is often a political decision. The Environmental Protection Agency — frequently demonized by politicians — came into existence in part because of a series of conflicts about how land and water were used. Companies once dumped their waste so freely into our watersheds that the Cuyahoga River actually caught fire several times. In the era before emissions control, the 1966 New York Smog killed 168 people. Once scientific data linked pollution to poorer quality of life, politicians acted to make citizens safer. This was a bipartisan issue: Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency as part of that response to pollution data. (And arguably, the real problem with the EPA is that it's not effective enough: ask anyone in Flint, Michigan who's gone more than a year without clean water, or anyone who lived downstream from DuPont in West Virginia.)
At first blush, Donald Trump's positions on science seem like familiar conservative refrains: denying climate change was also a hallmark of the George W. Bush administration, and vaccination has been controversial since its advent as a public health measure. Environmental regulation has always been disliked by massive corporations; Ronald Reagan attempted to destroy the Environmental Protection Agency, an endeavor at which he failed. Ignoring epidemiologists is also a proud Reagan legacy, and one of the reasons for the AIDS crisis' devastating toll was his continual refusal to address the problem.
Those are all familiar politics, with familiar boundaries, in a familiar system. But the Trump administration adds something new: Trump and his advisors have already signaled an unwillingness to hear facts they don't like, both on vaccine safety and climate change.
Trump has characterized climate change as a Chinese hoax, which is unlikely to help the people in areas already experiencing higher tides or increasingly strange weather. According to the Department of Defense, not only is climate change real, but it is likely to drive future conflicts between nations and perhaps bears some responsibility for fueling conflicts in Syria. Challenging the science of climate change is one thing; it is what the scientific method is designed to do. Denying the shared reality — the real reality — measured by hundreds of independent scientists is another. If the DoD is right, addressing climate change is also a national security issue.
Trump has already signaled an unwillingness to hear facts he doesn't like
Trump has met with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited doctor who manufactured a link between autism and vaccines through research fraud. He's asked anti-vaccine propagandist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head a new commission — on what, though, isn't entirely clear. According to Kennedy, it's a commission on vaccine safety and on scientific integrity, though Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement that the president-elect is “exploring the possibility of forming a commission on Autism.”
The link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked at this point. Spending more time and money on it not only ensures that time and money won't be spent researching something productive, but also wrongly suggests to the average citizen that vaccines are unsafe. Should Trump follow through with this ill-advised commission, it is a political maneuver likely to impact reality in unpleasant ways.
Outbreaks of preventable illness have already occurred thanks to vaccine-denying parents; it is possible more people will suffer these diseases as a result of the continual sowing of doubt about vaccine safety and efficacy. Arguably, the scientific establishment has a duty to protect the taxpayers that have supported research for so long.
But scientists sometimes shirk their moral duty to the populace in order to continue their research. Wernher von Braun has mostly been sidelined in the official history of NASA despite the pivotal role he played in publicizing space travel and building our country's early rockets. That's because he also collaborated with Nazis and built rockets using slave labor from concentration camp victims. Somewhat more forgivable is Ivan Pavlov — the one with the dogs and the saliva — who stopped openly opposing Joseph Stalin at the end of his life in the hopes of protecting the scientists in his lab; as a result, his lab flourished during Stalin's purges. Both men will always have asterisks next to their legacies, not because of their scientific work but because of the political alliances they formed in the course of that work.
Pavlov's example hints at something else. Scientists have office politics, too, and prominent members of the field can blackball younger researchers, preventing them from getting jobs or funding. This environment is part of what's contributed to a series of sexual harassment scandals over the last few years, across several areas of research.
Science provides us with facts — what we do with those facts is deeply political
The politics of the highest offices may also affect interpersonal relationships throughout the science community. The Trump administration rewards loyalists and punishes dissenters. Trump has also already signaled a willingness to go after researchers in specific fields, recently asking the Energy Department for a list of employees who have worked on climate change. And it's unclear what will happen to scientists who experience sexual harassment under a man who has himself been accused of sexual harassment by a number of women.
Science is a way of seeing that provides us with facts. What we do with those facts is deeply political. Determining whether pollution harms people is a matter of scientific inquiry, but deciding what to do in response to that data is politics. Who uses the water and land, and how? Those aren't scientific questions — they're political ones. Do we value the safety of our citizens or the profits of our corporations? What's the balance between the two? Those are also political questions.
No one can predict exactly how Trump will deal with the scientific community once he's in office. But the signals his administration has sent so far indicate that the relationship between science and politics is about to become more obvious — and more controversial — than ever before. We expect to cover this relationship closely.

Over the last decade, Millennials have matured and become an increasingly dominant part of society. This has led to more attention, various opinions forming, and a whole lot of criticism. Generation Y has become synonymous with being lazy, overconfident and entitled. I am here to explain that our generation is filled with entrepreneurs and ambitious talent and we're not just a bunch of lazy bums. The fact is, we are set to dominate the workforce and spend the most money in the years to come. What does this mean for society? Don't worry, the big economies of the world won't stop growing because we are busy updating our FaceBook status or taking a selfie. In fact, I believe that Millennials will make past generations more than pleased with what we can accomplish during our time on top. In this article you will learn a little more about Generation Y, what you can expect from us in the years to come and how you can prepare for the changes that are taking place, whether you like it or not.

Millennials – A Misunderstood Generation Set to Dominate
An Era of On Demand Technology
There's no doubt that Millennials are driven by technology. Most of us saw the evolution of cell phones, the internet and were early adapters to the gadgets we all love today. We are a generation fueled by social media. We're used to being updated on what we want, when we want and by which means we want. Whether it's the latest news, fashion trend or a mind-boggling question we need answered, the information is just a few clicks away. It's not a mystery why Google will take into account the mobile friendliness of a website when it calculates search result rankings starting April 21st.
What does this mean for the future? Most businesses are taking social media and mobile advertising very seriously. If you've not yet adapted to make this part of your marketing plan, it's time to realign your efforts. Gone are the days of TV commercials influencing our decisions. Only 17% of Millennials said they were influenced to buy from a TV ad. So how does a generation driven by technology make a decision to buy? Believe it or not, word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth has always dominated decisions to purchase, but online reviews are becoming more prevalent in the decision making process. From the mind of a Millennial, I never make a large purchase without first doing thorough research online and looking at past buyers reviews.
So how can you prepare for this? If you have not already adapted to the world of online marketing through social media and a mobile responsive website to capture sales, you better get busy. 41% of Millennials use their smartphones to make purchases. Buy into the fact that more than half of homes with paid TV service also have a DVR. Ads that used to capture the attention of the masses are now skipped over to get back to the next entrepreneur presenting their idea on Shark Tank. Consider hiring a Millennial to run your marketing department. They will know where you should focus your marketing dollars to capture the attention of the largest generation.
Employers Must Be Keen and Rewarding… or Else
A lot of the bad reputation of Millennials originates from the opinions we've brought into the workforce. We aren't a generation who will stick around at a job with minimal benefits, making barely enough money to keep our income up with inflation. Yes, many may consider this entitled, lazy or not being loyal. However, if you take a look at the opportunities available today, we merely want the best for our future. With start-up companies and tech giants rolling out the red carpet of benefits to employees, why would anyone want to settle for just a steady paycheck? What else is molding the generation? Entrepreneurship. Venture capitalists are more than willing to shell out millions for a great idea. The growing population is creating a void which is being filled by small businesses popping up daily. Millennials are not just a money greedy generation looking to make a buck. Part of the problem with many employers today is that they don't listen. Gen Y wants to be heard! We are a passionate bunch of individuals; a to-do list and weekly paycheck will leave us craving more from our careers. An Article by Millennial Marketing said this:
So what is that ‘right carrot'? Money? Time off? No, it's voice. And context. This week, I've had the pleasure of talking with three hardworking Millennials. Each has agreed to accompany me to The CMO Summit in New York and we've been preparing what to say. The panel will discuss “10 Things Millennials Wish They Could Tell Their CMO”. Like Adrian Dayton, my panelists (marketers with 4-7 years experience) insist they want their companies to get the best of what they have to offer. They also insist that harnessing their ideas has less to do with hours on the job than it does with adequate opportunities to be heard and contribute.
When companies fall short on realizing this, many Millennials look to entrepreneurship as an alternate. 79% of our generation consider quitting their job to work for themselves. It's never been so easy to start a side business on the internet through platforms like Fiverr and eBay. Because of this, many Millennials will start a business at an early age and never receive a W-2 at tax time. As Gen Y starts to take over the majority of the workforce in 2015, employers can prepare by thinking outside the box of standard benefits. Consider perks such as pets allowed at work, free meals, on-site gyms and meditation rooms, all of which are offered by start-ups around the world. Companies who stick to the standard mold of the past will suffer from high turnover rates and increased hiring costs. Most importantly, let your employees have a voice, we're not just looking for a fun place to work. Let us own our role and add value to the organization by allowing us to take the lead on assignments. If we aren't happy with the overall picture at work, we just may become freelancers and start a business of our own.
Student-Debt Will Rule Our Lives
Everyone was impacted in one way or another by the collapse of the housing market. Financial analysts have debated that student lending will be the next bubble to burst. Student debt has surpassed $1.1 trillion and at some point that rising number will have a serious impact on the economy. With the average student graduating from college $30,000 in the hole, it leaves less money for Millennials to spend on the things that would boost economic growth.
Housing market experts say we are still several years out from the bulk of Millennials becoming homeowners. Time.com dug a little deeper into the topic and believe the reason is the fact that Gen Y is getting married at a much later age than past generations. I think you can take this a step further and put some of the blame on the amount of student debt that graduates must overcome. Being a man of the Millennial generation, my belief was that I wasn't ready for marriage until I could provide a home for my bride-to-be. Had prices not reset though the market crash, I still may be saving to buy a home. The effect of the housing decline left a lasting impression not to purchase a home before being financially stable. Even if the banks would allow, most millennials would choose to pay off student loans before taking on a mortgage. Correcting the student debt problem so it does not affect future generations is the bigger challenge. Governor Rick Perry of Texas is seeking to take a chunk out of student debt and has encouraged 13 schools to introduce the $10,000 college degree. It's this type of progressive thinking that will create hope for our children and grandchildren.
A Generation of Diversity and Equality
45% of Gen Y believes in improving the position of minorities. Millennials are the most diverse generation in history. Growing up in the Cayman Islands and completing high school in Southern California, I grew up with every race around me. I never judged a person by their race and chose my friends based on their qualities more than anything else. The mix of future generations is staged to be even more diverse as we have children and our numbers multiply.
Millennials are the most educated generation in history. Thanks to the higher levels of education women of Gen Y are reaching. A study in 2014 by The Council of Economic Advisers said this:
Women have closed an educational attainment gap with men that dates back to World War II. In fact, starting in the late 1990s, just as the first Millennial cohorts were completing high school, women began to outpace men in completion of both four-year college degrees and post-college educational attainment. Millennial women on average exceed men in terms of educational attainment. This means they account for an increasingly large share of our skilled workforce and enter the labor force with early career earnings and employment rates that are considerably closer to their male peers.
With a more racially diverse generation and women closing the gap in the workforce, we can hope to see changes in discrimination for the better. If the trends of Millennials continue to grow into future generations, we will get closer to a society based on equality for all.
Millennials See the Glass Half Full… of Soy Milk
Although our wallets were not hit the hardest by the great recession, we certainly lived through the hardships and struggled to compete for jobs when things weren't looking great. Even with the burden of student loans and having experienced darker times, Millennials are the most optimistic about the future when compared to other generations. 49% of Gen Y believes the best years are yet to come. We may not all be in a great position at the moment, but we certainly feel we will get there in the future. Four of every five Millennials were encouraged about the years ahead, even though half of them are living paycheck to paycheck. (1)
Anyone looking to tap into the future finances of our generation would be smart to invest in health and nutrition. Specialty grocery stores, fitness programs and organic food products have already seen how Mellinnals will flock to their brands because of personal health choices. We are a generation consumed with eating right and exercising in uncommon ways. CrossFit, Zumba and spin class are just some of the alternative examples of how Gen Y chooses to get fit in a modern way. According to Barkely, 60% of our generation say they workout on a regular basis, while more than a quarter claim to be health fanatics.
As I hope you can see, Millennials are more than a bunch of overconfident, entitled and lazy individuals. We are diverse, optimistic, driven, and yes, a little tech crazy group of young men and women. We are taking over the workforce or creating a workforce of our own through entrepreneurship. We may not have the money now but in the next several years we will be spending the most, not just on gym memberships and nutrition products, but everything. So rest assured, while we are uploading a photo to InstaGram and pinning our favorite recipe to Pinterest, we are also focused on making a better world for future generations.
This is an amazing gift from a unbelievably thoughtful redditor. I got a beautiful and shiny collection of red ornaments to help flesh out my tree in the future as I just graduated from college and don't really have many currently.
I am also good an adorable bright orange fox to hang from my tree and a collection of eyelets and hanging hooks(which is so thoughtful because I hadn't even considered the fact that I didn't have any of those.)
Then there's a humming bird feeder that I can decorate a real tree with this spring and have humming bird friends all summer with any luck!
But the second wing related gift is just phenomenal. i play a game called warhammer, specifically my favorite army is tyranids. And my secret santa got me an entire squadron of gargoyles with ornament hooks on them all painted up to decorate my tree! That is just so awesome, I am amazed at the generosity and level of care that went into this gift.
Thank you so much
I've loved the Soul Series since playing the first Dark Souls on XB360- This is the sequel I had hoped for with the prior game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed a little variety from DSII, but this just feels like the true sequel to the first game. It's still brutally difficult and looks better than ever. The controls feel less delayed and there are far fewer graphical hiccups. It would have been awesome for the XBOne to be able to render this in 60fps, but the frame rate is at least consistent and rarely dips too much, even during large encounters. This is easily the most beautiful Souls game yet, with genuinely awe-inspiring environments and great character design. The souls games have always had little in the way of lore explanation or systems documentation and that's been some of the fun; discovering for yourself. This time though, there are numerous NPC quests that run contiguous with your quest and can be finished or failed with almost no way to tell how or when. I get the feeling they want you to play again to see what happens, but it does frustrate to get invested in a side quest only to have them die and have no idea why, or where it could have been avoided. Regardless, one of my favorite games this year.
Imagine a future in which all our cars, appliances and industrial processes are 10 times — maybe even 100 times — more energy efficient...
Imagine a future in which all our cars, appliances and industrial processes are 10 times — maybe even 100 times — more energy efficient than today's models. Wouldn't that be great? Just think of all the oil and coal saved, all the energy bills reduced, all the carbon dioxide emissions we stop pumping into the air.
Or maybe not. While energy efficiency is usually near the top on official to-do lists for combating climate change and staving off the ravages of peak oil, it tends to look better on paper or pdf than it does in real life.
Why? Let's hear from William Stanley Jevons:
“It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth.”
In his 1865 book, “The Coal Question,” English economist Jevons pointed out a counter-intuitive truth: that making a resource-consuming process more efficient actually increases, rather than decreases, consumption of that resource. He found the proof in Britain's coal industry, where the demand for coal skyrocketed after James Watts' steam engine made it far easier to pull the stuff out of the ground.
That effect, dubbed the Jevons paradox, remains with us today with even greater force. In its most recent update on the refrigerator market (pdf), for example, the US Department of Energy's EnergyStar programme found that the most energy-efficient fridges available weren't having as much of an impact on electricity savings as hoped. The reason? Nearly half (44 per cent) the people who buy efficient refrigerators don't dump old ones that are still working. Instead, they sell them, give them away or cart them off to a different part of the house (or the garage) to use as a second fridge.
It's reached the point where 26 per cent of all US households now have a second fridge … and that number is growing by 1 per cent a year.
Loughborough University professor Kevin Lomas found a similar effect in Britain, where “despite many technical improvements to the UK building stock, CO2 levels continue to rise.” Sloppy renovations are sometimes to blame, he discovered, but other times, the problem lies with homeowners: given a chance to continue, business as usual, and see their energy bills go down, they instead decide to crank up the heat a bit more than before, because their heating expenses won't go up, thanks to better insulation. (In fact, a paper released by the firm Geothermal Engineering this week reported that Britons now heat their homes to an average of 18 degrees C, a considerable increase over the 12 degrees C that was typical in the 1970s.)
Lomas' conclusion: “that reducing energy use by implementing energy-efficiency measures is more challenging than might be expected.”
So what's the answer? A bit more peer pressure might do the trick, according to economist Hunt Alcott, who's an Energy and Society Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He describes how one energy company has had success in encouraging customers to reduce their energy consumption by sending them reports showing how they compare to their neighbours. The inspiration for that programme came from a research study looking at the impact of public-service door-hangers left on homes in California.
“Some of the door-hangers said, ‘Save money by saving energy,' some of them said, ‘Save the environment,' and some said, ‘Here's how much your neighbours are using,' ” Alcott recalls. “And the ones that said, ‘Here's how much your neighbours are using' had a much stronger impact on energy consumption. In the last couple of years that study in particular has had a lot of influence.”
Seems like there might be a lesson or two in all this for carbon-cut-minded officials.

With Disney's new Cinderella movie being released on digital HD, DVD and Blu-ray on September 15th we decided to celebrate by creating a Cinderella inspired pumpkin. Plus, I'm giving away a digital HD copy of the new movie to one lucky reader! Details below…
Have you seen the new version of Disney's Cinderella? I love the shade of blue mixed with gold. It was a given that when we decided to paint our pumpkin that we used bright blue glitter with gold accents.
To make our pumpkin complete we had to include a Fairy Godmother wand to the top. You cannot have Cinderella without her Fairy Godmother, after all.
Follow the instructions below to turn your movie night into a craft night. Hosting a Cinderella movie viewing party? This pumpkin will make a beautiful centerpiece.
Supplies
Plastic White Pumpkin – purchased at Michael's
Blue Glitter Blast Spray Paint
Gold/Champagne Color Accents – found in wedding scrapbook section
Blue Butterflies – found in garden craft section of Michael's
Small Lollipop Stick or Cakepop Stick
How to Make a Cinderella Inspired Pumpkin
We used a plastic pumpkin so it would last through Fall and if my daughter wants to display it in her room as Disney decor she can. You can decorate a real pumpkin if you prefer. We poked a small hole in the top of the pumpkin for the wand. Spray paint your pumpkin and then let it sit to dry. We let ours dry over night before decorating.
Peel and stick your gold accents to your pumpkin. These scrapbook stickers worked well without much hassle. If they start to fall off, simply use hot glue and place a small dot on the pumpkin to hold down the jewels.
The butterfly came with a little metal pin attached to the back of it. I was able to poke the pin into the end of the lollipop stick to hold the butterfly in place. The pin was flexible so I could arrange the butterfly in either direction on the stick. If your wand topper does not have an easy way to attach it you can just dab a drop of hot glue to connect. I used a very small piece of curling ribbon to finish off the wand.
This Cinderella inspired pumpkin was very simple to make and even the kids can help you. I actually love it so much I'm thinking of putting it into my office!

We've been doing a lot of close support for a few customers recently, and part of that work involves doing diagnosis and performing measurements on various parts of their web stack. Some of that support is also just plain giving advice on how things can be done better.
It struck us that there's a pretty big set of these tools in the shed, but they're often not as well known as we thought. That's why we think they're worth sharing with you.
Giddyup!
Giddyup! is a tool for simplifying code rollouts. If you're a Rails person you'll be familiar with Capistrano; this is like that, but more general.
Push to a git repo, receive rollout. Just like that. The actions and smarts are taken care of by hook scripts that you supply. Don't have a git repo? There's your first problem, you should be using git.
BuiltWith
Not so much a dev tool as a way of having a poke at other people's sites, BuiltWith is a cool way of inspecting the technologies being used by a website.
At heart BuiltWith is really about business intelligence and providing reports that'd be useful for corporate strategy, but it's also a quick way to get a rundown of how a website gets things done. This is a boon for support staff when dealing with a site they've never seen before, as it helps give them a good idea of what they're up against or where to start looking.
Are You Still There?
In the same vein as the popular Down For Everyone Or Just Me, Are You Still There? tests whether your website is working from multiple locations around the world, but also reports the details of each test, including geographic location and response times.
If you've ever done support you'll have heard “my website is down!” countless times. It's sometimes handy to have an external perspective, and this is just the place to start. It's great to give to customers because they don't have to believe you, they can see the results for themselves.
Pingdom
Sometimes customers will want monitoring for themselves. If you can't hook them up with your monitoring systems, like we do, the next best thing is for them to arrange their own. For a pretty modest fee, Pingdom provides around-the-clock monitoring for web-facing services and can send alerts the moment it spots a problem.
We've found that customers love this sort of output, so it's definitely worth suggesting if they want more insight.
Blitz
Serious business customers often want to know just how much of a load their website can take without keeling over. While there's no shortage of tools to do this (eg. Apache bench, Jmeter, Siege), it's hard to do well. Customers sometimes ask if we can provide load-testing as a service; we could, but it's not something we specialise in, and we wouldn't be able to produce representative results from inside the datacentre.
This is where tools like Blitz come in. Blitz leverages Amazon's EC2 infrastructure to perform distributed load testing and aggregated results and metrics. One of their key selling points is that it's easy to integrate into the development lifecycle, which makes it appealing for web devs.

This may seem like an odd question, but the other day I found myself wondering what had become of George W. Bush. The answer, of course, is nothing. He lives in Dallas with Laura and…that's about it. For all practical purposes, he's disappeared. You'd hardly know that for eight years he was one of the most polarizing presidents in recent memory.
Why? Partly, it's because Bush himself has chosen to keep such a low profile. He makes motivational speeches now and again, and shows up for the odd dedication or funeral, but otherwise keeps to himself. Even his 2010 memoir barely made a splash.
But the real reason is deeper. Bush may have seemed larger than life for eight years, but he left a surprisingly thin legacy. Take his legislative agenda. No Child Left Behind is now widely unpopular among both liberals and conservatives—so unpopular that Congress has spent the past five years assiduously avoiding a vote to reauthorize it. His tax cuts expired in 2010 and are now little more than a political football. His own party wants to repeal key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Supreme Court has effectively gutted campaign finance reform. On the foreign policy front, his wars are widely viewed as expensive failures. And he was never able to get so much as a vote on Social Security privatization or immigration reform.
That doesn't leave much. Pretty much all that's left is the PATRIOT Act and the Medicare prescription drug bill. That's not much for eight years.
Beyond that, neither party wants anything to do with him. It's not surprising that Democrats still think of him as the Frat Boy President, one of the worst of all time, but what is surprising is that Republicans largely agree. A guy who was hailed in 2000 as the first real conservative since Reagan, and in 2004 as the second coming of Winston Churchill, was all but dead to the GOP by 2008. He was just another big spender who led the economy into a tailspin and then seemed to have no idea what to do about it. By the time his second term finally petered out, his reputation was toxic on both sides of the aisle.
Finally, there's Bush's curious lack of any intellectual legacy. The cynical will suggest that this is because Bush didn't have much of an intellect in the first place, but that's just a cheap shot. Nobody ever accused FDR or Truman of being intellectual giants, but everyone knows what the Truman Doctrine is. Ditto for most other presidents, even if they don't have a capital-D doctrine to their name. By contrast, Bush actually did have a capital-D doctrine to his name, but when Sarah Palin was asked in 2008 whether she supported the Bush Doctrine, she just stared blankly at interviewer Charlie Gibson. Palin took a lot of heat for that, but I actually felt a little bad for her. When I first heard that interview, I remember wracking my brain too, trying to figure just what Gibson was talking about. Is “Bring 'em on” a doctrine?
I'm not sure what to make of all this. I don't even really have a point. It's just sort of astonishing that a guy who was president only three years ago, and who loomed so large for both liberals and conservatives, has disappeared down the memory hole so completely. In the end, for all his swagger, he was a mile wide and an inch deep. Once he left the White House, it was as if his entire presidency had just been a bad dream.
Hence my question: Has any president in the last century disappeared so completely and so quickly from the national consciousness? I don't think so. In that respect, George W. Bush really did turn out to be the world historical figure he always wanted to be.
HD video recording is now firmly entrenched in the consumer space with affordable digital cameras shooting 1080p video. Likewise, many households have solid motion capture hardware in the form of Microsoft's Kinect Xbox peripheral. What happens when you combine the two? Magic, that's what happens.
RGBDToolkit is a system for taking the HD video that you record with a DSLR, and applying the Kinect's depth mapping on top of it. The results are far from perfect, but it adds a new dimension to your video. Microsoft has traditionally been encouraging of Kinect hacks, and this is one of the best I've ever seen.
The free software is available on Windows, Mac, and as source code on github. The software download also includes calibration images to make sure your rig is properly set up. Of course, that's only half the battle. The DSLR and Kinect have to be mounted together in a very particular way. The folks behind RGBDToolkit have instructions online on how to build the mounting rig that will give you the necessary camera positioning. Some of the materials include a drill press, saw, thumbscrews, strips of aluminum, and sandpaper.
You have to be a real “do it yourself” kind of geek to get this up and running, but the effect is very cool. The RGBDToolkit videos look like a virtual hologram that really shows you the depth of the scene. One day, cameras might have the option to incorporate depth data into the final product for a more immersive experience. For now, though, it's just for fun.

Indecent Exposure: The Aesthetic of Rollerblading
Everyone can be blown away by Pele. Tarzan would get bug-eyed at Michael Jackson's dance moves. Michael Jordan could bring tears to the eyes of a young Tibetan girl. Across almost all sports, the greatest athletes have universal appeal and appreciation. Even the best curler in the world could make a teenage boy giddy. However, generally speaking, some sports and activities have less visual appeal than others. A viral, extreme unicycling video may not lure the masses to the local unicycle store, and potato sack racing isn't necessarily the most enticing of activities in which to participate. The best human in potato sack racing may be impressive but the action itself of hopping very fast in a sack is quite difficult to make look appealing to the masses.
Style in sport and performance is what separates the appealing from the appalling. Whether one activity or performance is more difficult, more fun, or more creative than another is totally subjective. But having style is as easy to recognize as beauty in the human face. You can't exactly describe why someone's face is stunning, it just is. There's nothing specific you can point to that describes why most rollerbladers look goofy and unstylish. They just are.
Almost everyone can look a little more stylish wearing sunglasses. It might take a second look at Carrot Top in sunglasses to recognize what's really happening beneath those tinted shades. A skateboard under the feet of a skateboarder with bad style is like sunglasses on the face of an ugly person. The ugly is obscured by the restricted view. Conversely, many striking people on the planet have beautiful eyes. Put sunglasses on beautiful eyes and they look less appealing because the sunglasses restrict the view of the beauty.
In extreme sports, the reason skateboarding, BMX, scootering and snowboarding looks more stylish or more appealing than rollerblading to most is because the participants of these sports are not as exposed as rollerbladers. A squirly snowboarder is like a close-up cleavage shot of a woman that may otherwise be a butter-face. The snowboarder may look good up close, but zoom out and you'll take a pass. Likewise, the restrictions of the body's placement on the skateboard, scooter, bicycle or snowboard limit the body's ability to show something beautiful. These sports are full of unstylish participants wearing sunglasses as cover. When I watch any of these sports, it's like watching a beauty pageant in Iran — interesting but rather limited. In blading, the unrestricted movement of the arms and legs both in the air and on the ground allow for total freedom of expression of body form — a blessing if skilled but a curse if not.
It seems that every rollerblader I've ever seen skating down a bike path looks terribly awkward, with arms and legs stiff as if balancing on stilts while simultaneously being crucified. Very few people can make rollerblading look good because of how naked rollerbladers' style is. If they are not stylish and in control it is blatantly obvious. You can easily look cool simply bouncing a basketball even if you can never sink a 3-pointer. You don't need to be a pro to look chill if you lean a little while coasting on a skateboard. There's no need to learn to ollie. But it takes a decade on rollerblades to look comfortable simply striding down a sidewalk with cracks on it. Add the elements of a crooked run-up to a fastslide grind on a handrail and you quickly have the hardest sport in the world to make look impressive and easiest sport to make laughable, thanks to an out-of-control landing that results in a feature on Tosh.0.
This is precisely why rollerblading is incredible and unique from the rest of the extreme sports. There is no other sport that is so exposed and so difficult to make look impressive.

MISSOULA– Bernie Sanders is backing Rob Quist's campaign for Montana's U.S. House seat and will be campaigning with the Flathead folk musician across the state in May.
“Rob Quist is the only person in this race who understands that we need a government in Washington that works for all Montanans and all Americans and not just the special interests and the billionaire class,” Bernie Sanders said. “Congress right now is dominated by politicians who worry about the needs of their wealthy campaign contributors. We need members of Congress like Rob who will work to rebuild the shrinking middle class, who will fight all attempts to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and will oppose tax breaks for the very rich. Rob is a populist, grassroots candidate fighting for the working families of Montana. I look forward to campaigning with him in May and working with him in Congress.”
“I'm excited that Bernie Sanders recognizes that our grassroots campaign is building momentum and has the best chance in decades to take back Montana's U.S. House seat for the rest of us,” Rob Quist said. “In the U.S. House, I'll be a voice to protect our public lands, fight for working families, work for better health care, and stand up to Wall Street and special interests.”
Montanans can sign up to find out more details about Bernie and Rob's visit by texting BERNIE to 30644 or by going to http://robquist.org/bernie.
Reporters interested in attending events with Bernie and Rob should contact Tina Olechowski at tina@robquist.org.

In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war.
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters, thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russias border.
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia's borders as part of a huge military deployment.
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia's borders since the Cold War.
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time.
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war.
“This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation.
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.'
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad.
The United States' envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO's deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the ones who are many miles from home on the border of someone else's lands.
“This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia's) security posture,” Lute said.
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government.
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds.
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous cold war, and the same type of situation is developing today.
Call of Duty: WW2 launched with a host of weapon variants for almost all weapons.
Some of these variants are found under Collections at the Quartermaster, where others are only available in Supply Drops. With the release of COD Points in Call of Duty: WW2, came an update to the entire roster.
This meant that not only are there many possible variants to collect, but now they're also listed and shown under every weapon. The only way to get the vast majority of these variants is by finding them in Supply Drops.
These can be bought with real money through COD Points, but as we've explained before in our Supply Drops guide, there are other ways you can earn them by just playing the game. Paid-for or not, as it currently stands, these weapon variants are just skins. Most of them also come with permanent XP bonuses, but that's about the extent of their benefits.
Without further ado, here are all the variants currently in the game.

If you're looking for Call of Duty: WW2 content, we have a big list of guides. From a few tips on how to level up fast, to a full rundown of everything you need to know about loot box Supply Drops, Social Score, Armory Credits and the rest of the game's online features.
SACRAMENTO — With minor changes to win over moderates, a polarizing California bill to keep California's law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration agents cleared a key hurdle Monday and will head to the full Senate for a vote.
Senate Bill 54 is perhaps the Legislature's highest-profile act of defiance against the Trump administration, which is seeking to enlist the help of local police to carry out its promised crackdown on illegal immigration. The proposal would prohibit local and state agencies from using state resources to communicate with federal agents, with a few exceptions — such as task forces involving federal and local agencies.
“It's not a matter of ideology. It's a matter of common sense,” said the bill's author, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León. “Our communities will become more and not less dangerous when local police officers are pulled from their duties to pull otherwise law-abiding maids, bus boys, gardeners and day laborers for immigration violations.”
The bill officially titled the California Values Act advanced Monday on a party-line vote, despite opposition from the California State Sheriffs' Association and other groups, at a packed and testy Senate appropriations committee hearing. The sheriffs association remained opposed even after the recent amendments, such as one that would ensure the feds receive a 60-day notice before certain violent felons are released from state prison or local custody. Previously, the bill wouldn't have allowed such explicit communication about an inmate's release.

Why immigrant recruits face more scrutiny than white supremacists when they enlist
H-1B spouse work ban pushed ahead by Homeland Security While not enough to convert the sheriffs association, the concession prompted Assemblyman Jim Cooper, a law enforcement veteran and moderate Democrat from Elk Grove, to sign on as a co-author.
SB 54 was advanced as an “urgency bill,” which means it will take effect immediately if it wins support from two-thirds of the Senate and the Assembly and is signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, who has not indicated whether he will support the legislation.
The bill has the support of labor, religious and civil rights groups but has drawn sharp opposition from those who say it will protect criminals, or that the state shouldn't be going out of its way to shield those who entered the country illegally. The hearing room grew tense Monday at times, with audience observers on each side laughing, applauding, making sarcastic remarks or shushing one another.
One witness who had testified against the measure cursed at Sen. Scott Wiener as the Democratic senator from San Francisco spoke about the fear among his immigrant constituents and the stereotype that undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit crime, a characterization he called “absolute slander.”
Patricia Bates, a Republican from Southern California who serves as vice chairwoman of the Senate appropriations committee, said she worried the state's policies would leave otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants vulnerable to criminals who should be deported. She noted that some violent crimes, including corporal abuse of children and assault with a deadly weapon, were not covered in the new amendment.
“Individuals involved in this kind of crime are predators for people who live in these communities,” she said.
Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Roseville, suggested more amendments but said he doubted he would ever support such a measure, regardless of its final form. “This will set up a safe haven for criminals,” he said. “They will come to California. Why? They will be protected.”
Related Articles California immigration policy debate brings local law enforcement role into focus
A defiant California legislature fast-tracks `sanctuary state' bills Sen. Steven Bradford, D-Inglewood, said he, too, had received calls from concerned constituents, and that he appreciated the amendments that de León made last week.
Like his Republican colleagues, Bradford said, “We're very much committed to making our communities safer.” But, he added, “I think we'd all agree that mass deportation is not the answer.”
Wiener said he worries public safety will be compromised if crime victims or witnesses fear going to the police with information. Anxiety about the Trump administration's policies on immigration is widespread, he said. “What gives me fear and a lot of people fear,” he said, “is that we have children who are scared to go to school because they're worried they'll come home from school and their mom or dad might be gone.”
Update 2: Steam maintenance brought even more hints towards the new Steam Store.
Followed products
As some people have already noticed, there's a new tab called "Followed" in your games list on Steam Community. This following feature basically means there are no more "official game groups", they are being removed in favor of game hubs. Instead of joining an official group, you are now able to follow the game. Developers will still be able to post announcements, however we don't know if there will be an option to disable notifications for these announcements.
Owned product highlighting (source)
Looks like instead of highlighting the game (like some third-party extensions do), it will be a small icon displayed next to the product. Along with owned products, there are different flags: whenever an item is in your wishlist or cart.
Icons:
Owned product
Owned product In wishlist
In wishlist In cart
Dynamic store (source)
This is just a 2 line reference, but this only confirms that the frontpage will be highly customisable and tailored to each user.
Update: Moments after we published the blog post, Valve pushed a major update to the Steam Translation Server confirming a lot of the things we mentioned in this blog post and more.
Discovery queue
Discovery queue seems to work in a similar fashion to Greenlight's queue. You can change your preferences and filters to generate a queue of games that match your preferences. While you are exploring, you can jump to the next game and follow or ignore each product.
New store tab "Followed Games & Software"
We're unsure how this will work, but it might be related to your wishlist.
Curators
Curators are individuals or groups. Any group can become a curator, and by default the officers can add recommendations. Curators can recommend games to their followers. Recommendations can also include links to a longer review on their website. Steam will also recommend other curators for you to follow.
Personalised frontpage
Besides customizing your discovery queue and following curators you will be able to change sections of the frontpage to display different stuff. This includes:
Popular New Releases
Games
Software
Downloadable content
Games not in your account
Games already in your account
DLC for your games & software
Products you've recently viewed
New On Steam
Search revamp
You can now narrow your search by the following things:
Feature
Operating system
Language
Tag
Number of players
On an unrelated note; two-factor authentication
As you might know, SteamGuard is a 2-step authentication method, but this update brings alternative ways of authenticating besides email. The Steam Mobile app will have a built-in authenticator, but you can also use apps such as Google Authenticator (provided your phone has a camera to scan a QR code).
Original post:
A few months ago when Steam tags were first introduced, there was a short link to a "v6" stylesheet.
Seeing the Store is currently on it's 5th theme, this means Valve is hard at work at a 6th version of the Steam Store theme.
After getting a tip of another stylesheet for the new store, we decided to see if we can get it (sorta) working in a state where it gives us a feel of the new design.
Keep in mind that we're only checking out new stylesheets, this is only half of the Store's design (the other half being done in HTML and JavaScript) but should still give a good feel as to what it'll be like.
This is very much a work in progress, we have no idea how far along Valve is with the new design. It might launch tomorrow, or in a month.
Hints in current design
Recently, Valve updated the Steam Desktop client to a more flat and blue. The current Steam Store also has a hint of the new design on some pages, while already being prominent on others.
New features
Before jumping straight to screenshots, let's look at some hints to new features hidden within the new stylesheets, please do keep in mind this is all conjecture and we are missing a lot of information.
It's also very possible these features might never show up on the Store as we all know Valve likes to experiment.
We've added a "Source" link to each suspected feature, so those savvy enough can judge the stylesheets for themselves.
Overhauled frontpage
We're not entirely certain what will change on the new homepage, but it looks like it'll at least have something related to Steam Curators and the Discovery Queue functionality. All of this might be configurable.
Steam Curators seem to be a new sub-feature of the existing Steam Community group system. It looks like groups (or some members of said group) can recommend apps with some text explaining why they recommend it. These recommendations will then show up in the Steam Store. You'll be able to follow curators, the recommended apps from said curators will probably show up on the homepage.
Discovery queue (source)
This sounds like a personalized queue of games the store thinks you might like.
DRM notice (source)
There are also references to a "DRM notice" on app pages. It's likely to be a similar function to what some community plugins provide, warning users the app they might want to buy is using DRM.
Highlighting owned games (source)
The store will highlight games you already own.
Using tags while searching (source)
You'll now be able to use tags while searching.
Screenshots
Seeing Valve has only accidentally published the stylesheets, that's all we can show for now. This means that any page with actual layout/feature changes will probably seem really broken and unfinished.
The more broken a page looks, the more it gets changed in this upcoming store update.
Our previews are in no way a good representation of what the final version might look like.
Frontpage
The frontpage of the store looks pretty rough and incompatible with the new style, this means it'll probably be overhauled with the upcoming Store update. And no, the ugly gradient in the background is not our fault.
App page
Although not as broken as the frontpage, the app page looks pretty rough. It's probably still the best example of the new theme, even without any HTML changes.
Recommended
The Recommended page seems to look mostly fine with the new style, we've added the current recommended page as well for easy comparison (on the left).
Search
Search functionality is almost completely unusable with the current layout, this probably means that search is getting completely revamped in the upcoming Store update.
DRM notice
The earlier mentioned DRM notice on the app pages. Text is placeholder (and written by us).
Game hover
The popup when you hover over a game on the store has also seen some changes.
Future updates
We doubt Valve is completely done with the stylesheets, if they ever update them our SteamTracking repo on GitHub should track any changes.

Background
In 2014, the Ministry of Justice divided the probation system—responsible for supervising, rehabilitating and (where necessary) resettling offenders, after or instead of a custodial sentence—into two parts:
the National Probation Service (NPS)—handle high risk offenders (the NPS is a public body); and
Community Rehabilitation Centres (CRCs)—of which there are 21 across England and Wales—handle low and medium risk offenders and services are delivered by private or third sector organisations (eight private organisations run the 21 CRCs).
The Government also introduced a provision in the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014 which required that rehabilitation activity be provided to short-sentenced offenders (i.e. those receiving a custodial sentences of 12 months or less).
In 2015, Through-the-Gate was introduced and CRCs were given responsibility to support offenders in the 12 weeks before their release from prison and in the period after their release. Collectively these reforms are known as ‘Transforming Rehabilitation'.

Tomgram: Engelhardt, Waist Deep in the Washington Quagmire
Cutting $100 Billion?... Easy
If Only Washington Had a Brain
By Tom Engelhardt
Here's the latest news from Congress, in case you've been in Afghanistan for the last couple of weeks. A debate about slashing the federal budget is now upon us, while fears of a possible government shutdown as spring approaches are on the rise. The Republican leadership of the House of Representatives originally picked $40 billion as its target figure for cuts to the as-yet-not-enacted 2011 budget. That was the gauntlet it threw down to the Obama administration, only to find its own proposal slashed to bits by the freshman class of that body's conservative majority.
They insisted on adhering to a Republican Pledge to America vow to cut $100 billion from the budget. With that figure back on the table, Democrats are gasping, while pundits are predicting widespread pain in the land, including the possible loss of at least 70,000 jobs “as government aid to cops, teachers, and research is slashed.”
In the meantime, the Obama administration has hustled its own entry in the cut-and-burn sweepstakes into place, leaving Democrats again gasping. Its plan calls for ending or trimming more than 200 federal programs next year. It also reportedly offers cuts adding up to $1.1 trillion over a decade and puts in place a “five-year freeze on domestic programs [that] would reduce spending in that category to the lowest level, measured against the economy, since President Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961.”
It all sounds daunting, and the muttering is only beginning about “entitlement” programs -- Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid -- that have yet to be touched.
Which reminds me: Didn't I mention Afghanistan?
If so, how fortunate, because there's a perfectly obvious path toward that Republican goal of $100 billion. If we were to embark on it, there would be even more cuts to follow and -- believe it or not -- they wouldn't be all that painful, provided we did one small thing: change our thinking about making war.
After all, according to the Pentagon, the cost of the Afghan War in 2012 will be almost $300 million a day or, for all 365 of them, $107.3 billion. Like anything having to do with American war-fighting, however, such figures regularly turn out to be undercounts. Other estimates for our yearly war costs there go as high as $120-$160 billion.
And let's face it, it's a war worth ending fast. Almost a decade after the Bush administration invaded Afghanistan, the U.S. military is still fruitlessly engaged in possibly the stupidest frontier war in our history, thousands of miles from home in the backlands of the planet. It's just the sort of dumb conflict that has, historically, tended to drive declining imperial powers around the bend, just the sort -- in the very same country -- that helped do in the Soviet Union. And though news from that war remains remarkably grim, were we by some miracle to win, for hundreds of billions of dollars we would have gained tenuous control over the fifth poorest, second most corrupt, and premier narco-state on the planet. Al-Qaeda, on the other hand, would undoubtedly still be happily ensconced in the Pakistani tribal border areas with a range of superbly failed states available elsewhere for exploitation.
There's genuine money to be slashed simply by bringing the troops home, but okay, I hear you. You live in Washington and you can't bear to give up that war, lock, stock, and barrel.
I understand. Really, I do. So let's just pretend that we're part of that “moderate” and beleaguered House leadership and really only want to go after $40 billion in the 2011 federal budget.
In that case, here's an idea! We've been training the Afghan military and police forces for almost a decade now, dumping an estimated $29-billion-plus into the endeavor, only to find that, unlike the Taliban, our Afghans generally prefer not to fight and love to desert. What if the Obama administration were simply to stop the training program? What if we weren't to spend the $11.6 billion slated for this year, or the up-to-$12.8 billion being discussed for next year, or the $6 billion or more annually thereafter to create a security force of nearly 400,000 Afghans that we'll have to pay for into eternity, since the Afghan government is essentially broke?
What if, instead, we went cold turkey on our obsession with training Afghans? For one thing, you'd promptly wipe out more than a quarter of that $40 billion the House leadership wants to cut and many more billions for years to come. (And that doesn't even take into account all the saveable American dollars going down the tubes in Afghanistan -- a recent report from the U.S. special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction suggested it adds up to $12 billion for the Afghan Army alone -- in graft, corruption, and pure incompetence.)
Think about it this way: Are we actually safer if we get rid of police, firefighters, and teachers here in the U.S., while essentially hiring hordes of police and military personnel to secure Afghanistan? I suspect you know how most Americans would answer that question.
Dumb Intelligence Runs Rampant
Here's another way to approach both those $40 billion and $100 billion targets. Start with the budget for the labyrinthine U.S. Intelligence Community which is officially $80.1 billion. That, of course, is sure to prove an undercount. So, just for the heck of it, let's take a wild guess and assume that the real figure probably edges closer to... $100 billion.
I know, I know, the Republican House majority will never agree to get rid of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, and neither will the Democrats. They'll claim that Washington would be blinded by such an act -- although it's no less reasonable to argue that, without the blinders of what we call “intelligence,” which is largely a morass of dead thinking about our world, our leaders might finally be able to see again. Nonetheless, in the spirit of compromise with a crew that hates the “federal bureaucracy” (until the words “national security” come up), how about cutting back from 17 intelligence outfits to maybe three? Let's say, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency.
I'll bet you're talking an easy $40 to $50 billion dollars in savings right there -- and the cost of the job-retraining programs for the out-of-work intelligence analysts and operatives would be minimal by comparison.
According to a Washington Post series, “Top Secret America,” here are just a few of the things that you, the taxpayer, have helped our intelligence bureaucracy do: Produce 50,000 intelligence reports annually; create the sheer redundancy of “51 federal organizations and military commands, operating in 15 U.S. cities, [to] track the flow of money to and from terrorist networks”; and, in the category of the monumental (as well as monumentally useless), construct “33 building complexes for top-secret intelligence work... since September 2001. Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings -- about 17 million square feet of space.”
Take just one example: the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency which has 16,000 employees and a “black budget thought to be at least $5 billion per year.” Until now, you may not have known that such a crew was protecting your security, but you're paying through the nose for its construction spree anyway. Believe it or not, as Gregg Easterbrook has pointed out, it now has a gleaming new, nearly Pentagon-sized headquarters complex rising in Virginia at the cost of $1.8 billion -- almost as expensive, that is, as the Freedom Tower now going up at Ground Zero in Manhattan.
Or let's check out some smaller, distinctly choppable potatoes. Officially, America's Iraq War is ending (even if in a Shiite-dominated state allied with Iran). All American military personnel are, at least theoretically, to leave the country by year's end. Whether that happens or not, the Obama administration evidently remains convinced that it's in our interest to prolong our effort to control that country. As a result, the planned “civilian” presence left behind to staff the three-quarters-of-a-billion-dollar citadel of an “embassy” the U.S. built in downtown Baghdad and various consular outposts will look uncomfortably like a mini-army.
As Wired.com's Danger Room website put it recently, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq "will become a de facto general of a huge, for-hire army." We're talking about 5,500 mercenaries paid to guard the 17,000 “civilians,” representing various U.S. government agencies and the State Department there. To guard the Baghdad embassy alone -- really a regional command headquarters -- there will be 3,650 hired guns under contract for almost $1 billion. The full complement of heavily armed mercenaries will operate out of “15 different sites... including 3 air hubs, 3 police training centers... and 5 Office of Security Cooperation sites.”
In 2010, USA Today estimated that the cost of operating just the monstrous Baghdad embassy was more than $1.5 billion a year. God knows what it is now.
What if the cost-cutters in Washington were to conclude that it was a fruitless task to try to manage the unmanageable (i.e., Iraq) and that, instead of militarizing the State Department, the U.S. should return to the business of diplomacy with a modest embassy and a consulate or two to negotiate deals, discuss matters of common interest, and hand out the odd visa. That would represent a cost-cutting extravaganza on a small scale. (And the same could be said for the near billion-dollar “embassy” being built in Islamabad, Pakistan, and the $790 million going into another such embassy and consulates in Afghanistan.)
Deep in the Big Muddy
It's important to note that none of the potential cost-cutting measures I've mentioned touch the big palooka. I'm talking about the Pentagon budget, a very distinctive “entitlement” program on the American landscape. Given the news reports on “Pentagon cuts” lately, you might think that the Obama administration is taking a hatchet to the Defense Department's funds, but think again. As defense analyst Miriam Pemberton wrote recently, “The Pentagon is following the familiar tradition of planning ambitious increases, paring them back, and calling this a cut.” In fact, at $553 billion, the proposed Pentagon budget for 2012 actually represents a 5% increase over the already stunningly bloated 2011 version of the same.
Keep in mind that U.S. military spending equals that of the next 15 countries combined (most of them allies) and represents 47% of total global military spending. If Washington's mindset were different, it wouldn't be hard to find that $100 billion the Republican House freshmen are looking for in the Pentagon budget alone -- quite aside from cuts in supplemental war-fighting funds -- and still be the most heavily armed nation on the planet.
And here's my question to you: Don't you find it odd that cuts of this potential size are so obviously available and yet, with all the raging and groaning about deficits and budget-cutting, no one who matters seems to focus on such possibilities at all? To head down this path, Washington would need to make only the smallest of changes: it would have to begin thinking outside the war box for about a minute and 30 seconds.
Our leaders would have to conclude the obvious: that, in these last years, war hasn't proven the best way to advance American interests. We would have to decide that real security does not involve fighting permanently in distant lands, pursuing a “war on terror” in 75 countries, or growing the Pentagon (and the weapons-makers that go with it) year after year.
Americans would have to begin to think anew. That's all. The minute we did, our financial situation would look different and for all we know, something like not-war, if not peace, might begin to break out.
Forty years ago, Americans regularly spoke about a war 7,500 miles away in Vietnam as a “quagmire.” We were, as one protest song of that era went, "waist deep in the Big Muddy.” Today, Afghanistan, too, looks like a quagmire, but don't be fooled. The real quagmire isn't there; it's right here in Washington D.C., that capital mythically built on a swamp.
There's no way that thinking so old and stale, so out-of-date, can begin to take in or react adventurously to a fast-changing world. Look at Egypt, or China, or Brazil, or India, or Turkey. There, new thinking and new developments are blooming, but you wouldn't know it in Washington.
Neither $553 billion nor $80.1 billion can buy Washington a brain. Right now, by all evidence, our leaders are still convinced that it's their job to run the world and fight distant wars until hell freezes over. They can't bear to think a new thought, or take a chance, or experiment on anything, or look at our planet in a new way. At the moment, the evidence indicates that they have the brainpower of the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz without that character's urge for self-improvement, and it's taking us down.

The pig dates back 40 million years to fossils which indicate that wild porcine animals roamed forests and swamps in Europe and Asia. Remains of the earliest known North American peccary,, are from late Eocene sediments dating from 37 million years ago in North America. But it's the domesticated pig that holds our interest. Pigs were domesticated in China around 4900BC (although some experts claim 7000 to 6000BC in Western Asia) and were being raised in Europe by 1500BC. The Romans improved pig breeding and spread pork production throughout their empire. Two main types were developed: one breed was large, with floppy ears, and produced copious amounts of lard, while the other was of a smaller frame, with erect ears, used primarily for meat.
Jewish religious law banned the eating of pork before 1000BC, based on a belief that pigs were unclean since they ate waste, and there was the fear of disease (no doubt associated with contracting trichinosis from eating improperly cooked pork or the belief that pork meat didn't last long before "going off"); don't forget that nomadic cultures are not as suited to pigs as they are to cattle, sheep, or camels. Early Christians also shunned pork, but by around AD50 those restrictions were relaxed. Muhammad also banned the consumption of pork, resulting in a severe decline in the pig population of the Middle East and Western Asia. Europe, being principally Christian, embraced the pig: Swine ate anything, reproduced prodigiously, and their meat was easily preserved. By the 1500's in Europe, the Celtic people in the north were breeding large-bodied, well-muscled pigs, while in Southern Europe, the Iberians had developed smaller-framed, lard-type pigs. All of the pigs of this time period were dark-colored.
At Queen Isabella's insistence, Christopher Columbus took eight pigs on his voyage to Cuba in 1493. They were tough and could survive the voyage with minimal care, they supplied an emergency food source if needed, and those that escaped provided meat for hunting on return trips. But Hernando de Soto was the true "father of the American pork industry." He brought America's first 13 pigs to Tampa Bay, Fla., in 1539. As the herds grew, explorers used the pigs not only for eating as fresh meat but for salt pork and preserved pork. American Indians were reportedly so fond of the taste of pork that attacks to acquire it resulted in some of the worst assaults on the expedition. By the time de Soto died three years later, his original herd of 13 pigs had grown to 700 – a very conservative estimate. This number doesn't include the pigs eaten by his troops, those that escaped and became wild pigs (the ancestors of today's feral pigs), and those given to the American Indians to keep the peace. The pork industry in America had begun.
As an interesting tidbit, the feared buccaneers of the Caribbean derived their name from the Arawak Indian word buccan, referring to a wooden frame used for smoking meats. The French changed this to boucan and called the French hunters who used these frames to cook and preserve feral cattle and the offspring of Columbus' pigs on the island of Hispaniola boucanier. English colonists anglicized the word to buccaneers.
Pig production spread rapidly through the new colonies. Cortés introduced hogs to New Mexico in 1600 while Sir Walter Raleigh brought sows to Jamestown colony in 1607. Semiwild pigs ravaged New York colonists' grain fields to the extent that every pig 14 inches in height that was owned by a colonist was required to have a ring in its nose to make it easier to control. On Manhattan Island, a long solid wall to exclude rampaging pigs was constructed on the northern edge of the colony; it created the name for the area now known as Wall Street. By 1660 the pig population of Pennsyl­vania Colony numbered in the thousands. By the end of the 1600s, the typical farmer owned four or five pigs, supplying salt pork, ham, and bacon for his table; any surplus was sold as "barreled pork" (pork meat preserved in salted brine, contained in wooden barrels). Finishing pigs before slaughter on American Indian corn became popular in Pennsylvania, setting the new standard for fattening before the late fall pork harvest.
At the end of the 1700s, pioneers started heading west, taking their utilitarian pigs with them. Wooden crates filled with young pigs often hung from the axles of prairie schooner wagons. As western herds increased, processing and packing facilities began to spring up in major cities. Pigs were first commercially slaughtered in Cincinnati, which became known as "Porkopolis"; by the mid 1800s Cincinnati led the nation in pig processing. Getting the pigs to market in the 1850s was no small task. Drovers herded their pigs along trails, with the aid of drivers who handled up to 100 pigs each. It is estimated that between 40,000 and 70,000 pigs were driven from Ohio to eastern markets in any given year. A herd could travel 5-8 miles a day and covered total distances up to 700 miles.
In 1887 Swift & Co. introduced the refrigerated railroad car, chilled by a solution of ice and salt (mechanical refrigeration wouldn't appear until 1947). It created a revolution in pig farming: Slaughterhouses could be centralized near production centers since processed pork meat could be shipped instead of live hogs. Large terminal markets developed in Chicago; Kansas City, Mo; St. Joseph, Mo.; and Sioux City, Iowa. Centralized packing plants were located adjacent to the stockyards. The natural progression was for the pork industry to relocate to the Upper Midwest, where the majority of the grain was raised; Corn Belt morphed into Hog Belt. Today Iowa is still the top pork producer in the States.
The trend was for developing herds that produced higher numbers of offspring and pigs that were leaner (resulting in better feed efficiency). Husbandry methods emphasized control of diseases caused by huge factory pig-raising techniques, introducing the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Pork had become "the Other White Meat", and although production was more efficient and cost-effective, the taste was steadily being bred away.
Now the trend is toward a return to the older, fattier, tastier heritage breeds such as the Berkshire, the Red Wattle, the Tamworth, the Large Black, the Mule Foot, the Old Spot, and the Ossabaw (a direct descendent of the original Iberico black-footed hogs imported by the Spaniards to Savannah, Ga., some 400 years ago). Their meat has superior taste and texture, with marbling that retains the moisture of the meat. There is also a greatly increased demand for small farm, pasture-raised, organically grown pigs, and rejection of methods such as water-injection for finished pork. A happier pig is a tastier pig!
Audiences will soon be able to soar above the Holy Land and explore one of the oldest and most mythic cities in the world with "Jerusalem," an IMAX 3D spectacle that will be hitting the large-scale screens this fall.
"Jerusalem" puts the ancient city front and center (and often above) as it traverses a land considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which will each be respectively represented in the film by three teenagers who call the city home. The documentary gives audiences a rare glimpse of the city fought over more than any other place in history, a place conquered and destroyed, rebuilt and reinvented repeatedly over 5,000 years.
Watch 'Jerusalem' 3D Trailer:
The film offers exclusive looks at the Western Wall, the Dome of the Rock, the Jordan River, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Sea of Galilee and the mountain fortress of Masada, as well as little-known parts of the region.
The 43-minute documentary's sense of majesty as it examines the intersection of science, history and religion in one enigmatic location is further enhanced by narration provided by British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, whose dulcet voice brings a sense of intelligence and authority for those who know his pitch-perfect portrayal of Sherlock Holmes on the BBC series, "Sherlock" ... and a slight sense of seductive menace for those who know his recent villainous turn as Khan in "Star Trek Into Darkness."
(And, come to think of it, all of those grand aerial shots in the trailer might be considered the POV of the mighty Smaug, the dragon whom Cumberbatch will be portraying in this holiday season's "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.")
"Jerusalem" will premiere in IMAX and digital 3D cinemas on September 20.
Amazon's Alexa has many different ways for you to request just the right music. Now it has gained a few new advanced music commands that might come in handy. These new commands let you request music similar to other tracks, music that is popular in a particular part of the world, and music that you've played in the past but can't exactly remember.
If you want to hear music that is similar to other music, you can now request it by asking “Alexa, play songs similar to [song / artist].” You can also be more specific by including a mood or era prior to saying the artist's name. While listening to any song, you can say “Alexa, play more like this” to play songs similar to the one you're listening to.
To go along with Amazon's recent expansion of Echo devices and Music Unlimited around the world, you can now request to hear popular songs by region. Just say “Alexa, play the top songs in [region]” and you'll hear music that's on the top of the charts in other countries.
If you're not looking to find new music to listen to but aren't sure what to listen to, you can now ask “Alexa, play some [songs / albums] I haven't heard in a while.” If you want to be a bit more specific but still want to hear something you haven't heard recently, you can say “Alexa, play some [artist / genre] I haven't heard in a while.” You can also request stations and playlists that you haven't heard recently.
Lastly, you can now be very specific about recalling music you've heard in the past. If you were listening to something you enjoyed the other day but don't know the song names or artists, you can say “Alexa, play the songs I heard [yesterday / last night].” If you know the exact date that you were listening to the forgot songs, you can say the exact date instead of saying yesterday or last night.
These new recall commands don't just work on songs, but also work for artists, genres, stations, and playlists. You can say “Alexa, play the [artist / genre / station / playlist] I was listening to on [day]” to bring up specific music from the past that you may not be able to recall any other way.

Andi Zeisler is one of the founding editors of Bitch magazine, a 20-year-old feminist publication that was started and continues to this day to be an examination of feminism and pop culture. For a long time, Bitch was a fairly unique publication, but in the past decade, the internet has created an explosion of Bitch-style writing about feminism pop culture.
Just as interestingly, pop culture seems to be talking back. Feminism has gone mainstream, with pop stars adopting the term and movie stars pushing for equal pay for equal work. In her new book "We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirl®, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement", Zeisler takes a critical eye towards this pop culture embrace of feminism. It's exciting in parts, troubling in parts and rarely, if ever, simple.

I spoke with Zeisler about her book, Taylor Swift and what feminism means in an era when it's being used to pitch soap and make-up.
Feminism is having a moment in pop culture with stars like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift embracing the term publicly and multiple feminist campaigns going mainstream in a big way. I've personally been really excited about this, but in your book you argue that we should be skeptical of all this “rah-rah,” “you go girl” feminism. Why?
I should clarify by saying that I'm really excited too. That's always been part of what Bitch's mission is about, to really sort of locate feminism and opportunities to really make feminism important within mainstream culture. It's not that I think it's a bad thing inherently, it's just that I'm sort of ambivalent about the way it's manifesting in a lot of ways. The idea of marketplace feminism, which I define as a process by which the language and imagery that have been created and nurtured within feminist movements are sort of harnessed in the service of capitalism, I see that as definitely something that's happening parallel to really grassroots and increasingly grassroots and intersectional and nuanced feminist campaigns. So it's almost like there are these two realms and there's not a ton of overlap between them and one is just being amplified much more than the other one. And I have concerns about that, because the one that is the loudest and the most eye-catching is also the more simplistic of them.
What would be a good example of the marketplace feminism that concerns you?
I think advertising and the realms in advertising where feminists concepts have sort of been harnessed. Things like the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty or the Always Throw Like a Girl campaign, where it's always very loosely about the idea of empowerment and feeling good about yourself, but it's also very much a canny kind of way to sell stuff. Instead of using the language of shame and insecurity, which has always been the mainstay of marketing to women, the language is kind of switched to be about this vague idea of empowerment and personal sense of well-being that comes from feeling good about yourself. But the products are not changing.
And certainly in the case of Dove, it hasn't stopped the brand from continuing to invent new insecurities for women to address with Dove products, like their whitening underarm deodorant or whatever it is.
Advertisement:
It's a bait-and-switch, but it's very clever and it's often very well done. Especially with the use of viral videos, Dove has really managed to kind of hijack concepts about beauty and self-esteem and questioning beauty standards that have always existed within feminist movements.
An example that's more in mainstream culture is Sheryl Sandberg and the whole Lean In movement and the idea that there's this very individualized embrace of feminism as being about your own personal success, your own personal self-actualization, your own potential, but is not really about feminism as action and feminism as being about liberating all women.
There can be a reactionary vibe in these things. Willingly or not, they imply that the biggest obstacle for women between them and “empowerment” is themselves, not society.
Exactly, and that's what's so insidious about it. We're already a society and a consumer culture that's really focused almost exclusively on the individual, and so this kind of language really doubles down on that and makes it seem like we don't have to be battling systems and reforming institutions and values within them, we just need to get over ourselves or feel empowered or own our inner warrior or whatever. It works very well for a capitalistic society, but it does not work very well if we're talking about the larger project of equality and liberation and reform.

Speaking to your ambivalence, there are definitely examples that come to mind of pop culture feminism that come to mind that are just awesome and very powerful and send the right message. I've become mildly obsessed with Beyoncé's “Lemonade,” and I think it's a really good example of feminism in pop culture done right. What do you think of that?
I talk about Beyoncé quite a bit in the book because I feel like for the past several years she has been this incredibly divisive figure both among people who self-identify as feminists and people who don't. There's this very push-pull dynamic between people who, for whatever reason, want to claim that Beyoncé can't be a feminist because she doesn't wear pants or she's married to Jay-Z or any number of things. Then there are people who think there has always been this thread of feminism running through her work — she contributed to the Shriver report, she really does think about feminism on an intersectional level. So it's a really weird dynamic.
I have to say that I don't really feel at all qualified to talk about “Lemonade” as a piece of art or social commentary, just because it's so specifically for black women and about this place—both physically the place of the self and culturally the place of institutionalized racism and police brutality.

So I have avoided wading into that fray, but I think it's an excellent example of why it's very hard for people to accept Beyoncé as a feminist, because she does go beyond this kind of safe platitudes about empowerment and feeling good and feminism being about whatever it is you want it to be about. She really does challenge that frame, and that's something we definitely don't expect the biggest pop star in the world to do. It definitely is a way of expressing her power and her knowledge and her experience that makes a lot of people uncomfortable, I think.
One of the examples you use of why we should be more skeptical is that while all of this has been going on in the media, we're also seeing in the real world a loss of rights for women. Particularly in red states, Republicans have been shutting down abortion clinics through red tape regulation at an astonishing rate. I sense that this is a backlash, because feminists are making progress and it's causing conservatives to panic and put all their resources and energy into things like curtailing reproductive rights as a response. What do you think of that?
Yeah, I think that's definitely true. I think partly because of the speed with which news and culture is mediated, there's definitely been a condensing of backlash cycles, where we see them happening more and more concurrently as time goes on. This is partly why I wanted to write this book: to talk about the fact that embrace and backlash have always been things that really played out within the media and pop culture, and have really shaped how we publicly understand feminism and how feminist ideals get filtered through media and pop culture.
Advertisement:
It's tough, because it's absolutely true that we have really seen feminism become so much more almost ambient, in the sense that there's a lot that we just sort of naturally understand as crucial in a way that we didn't even three or four decades ago. We understand that we're not going to let someone like Bill Cosby slide anymore. We understand that there's a level of transparency that when organizations like Susan G. Komen start talking about no longer funding Planned Parenthood for some bullshit reason, there's gonna be a critical mass of pushback.
So yeah, a lot of what has happened because there has been so many grassroots and often online-based feminist action. But at the same time, there's a little bit of a danger in feeling like we have come to a certain place and can or should be satisfied with what's happening. Because as we've seen in many parts of history, you can't stop, because there's always a backlash that's either right around the corner or already happening. And again, this is why I do feel ambivalent. This is why I don't feel like this is a really cut-and-dried situation of “pop culture feminism is bad” or “pop culture feminism is amazing.” I think it's both at once.
Besides Beyoncé, who are some examples of people you think are getting it right?
Someone was asking me about Amy Schumer recently, and I have to say I like Amy Schumer and I think she does get it right. I mean, no one is gonna get it right all the time, so I think that's something we have to dispense with. That is often something that happens in feminist spheres of viewing pop culture. We decide someone is an icon and then slowly begin chipping away as soon as they reveal that they are human and not perfect.
Advertisement:
But that said, I do think that Amy Schumer is someone who is using a pretty potent mix of human and self-awareness and self-deprecation to talk about a lot of the double standards, in particular. I love the fact that, for instance, someone asked her, “Oh, isn't it such a good time to be a female comic in Hollywood?” And she literally was like, “Are you fucking crazy?” She doesn't buy into the hype of like, “Oh look, a few good things have happened. We've arrived. We're in this golden feminist age.” I think that's a really easy thing to fall into, feeling victorious and then stopping there, and I appreciate that she's not doing that. And I appreciate that she has, in a lot of ways, pushed back on the idea that you have to be likeable if you're gonna speak up about something and be really honest about it.
I think television in general has been an especially rich site of increasingly complex and challenging conversations around feminism and representation and anti-racism and a lot of these things. I think it just speaks to the idea that the more different lenses and backgrounds that people bring to creating and producing and directing, the more the medium is going to reflect people's lives in the real world. And again, it's not that there's any sort of perfect feminist product out there, in terms of popular culture, but the fact that we're seeing such a wide range of representations and points of view is really crucial.
So, Taylor Swift…
[Laughs] You know, I don't really have a dog in the Taylor Swift fight, but I do think that her whole experience as a public figure grappling with feminism has been sort of a microcosm around our reaction to people declaring themselves feminists.
Advertisement:
I wrote about this in the book. She was like, “I'm not a feminist; I don't believe in girls versus boys,” and the internet freaked out. There was this whole cycle of response pieces: “Leave Taylor Swift alone”; “Taylor Swift is totally a feminist”; “Taylor Swift comes from a long tradition of country music women who were feminists, so even if she doesn't think she's a feminist, I'm saying she's a feminist.”
And then she was like, “Oh wait, I'm friends with Lena Dunham now. Maybe I'm a feminist.” And then there's a whole other cycle of think pieces.
I think it speaks to this idea of why we're putting so much onus on individual celebrities to conform to an ideology and enact it in a way that makes us feel good as viewers. It, of course, turned into this whole “listicle feminism” thing, where it's like “The Nine Most Feminist Things Taylor Swift Ever Said.”
It's a very weird phenomenon, and I think her example really does typify how celebrity feminism becomes about the celebrity themselves rather than about feminism. It becomes about their bravery or their journey or their individual belief in what feminism is, rather than the fact that feminism is something that exists whether or not celebrities embrace it or not, and has very real consequences for people who aren't celebrities and who aren't able to put it on and take it off at whim.

Taking all this into consideration, obviously the struggle between pop culture and feminism, “the journey” anyway, isn't going anywhere, and you really don't want it to, either. What changes would you like to see to make things somehow less toxic than they can be, or generally better for feminism and pop culture together?
I do think that so much of it is about critical thinking and about really looking at the difference between politics and capitalism. We're consumers. That's what we're encouraged to do; that's what we are socialized to do; that's what the media encourages in us. So even acknowledging that marketplace feminism makes sense in this very heavily mediated and capitalist world, I still think it's worth trying to differentiate between what is trying to sell us stuff and what is trying to really talk about a more complex agenda toward equality and autonomy.
And then, looking more at systems than at individuals, and not necessarily thinking about feminism as something to consume. So, for instance, with movies, we've come to talk a lot about what's OK to consume as a feminist movie. We talk about the Bechdel test, we talk about things like "Mad Max." But I think maybe the more interesting, but more challenging question is: Is there such a thing as a feminist movie in an industry like Hollywood, which is still in many ways predicated on inequality? I think taking it out of the realm of the individual and the consumable and looking at feminism more as an ongoing, evolving lens, rather than a metric of quality, is probably a good way to go.
Getty Images Last time stocks had a run like this, the first Bush was U.S. president and Boris Yeltsin was his Russian counterpart.
Stocks have done something they haven't done in more than a quarter of a century, with the Dow industrials, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all closing at record levels for a fifth session in a row.
Stocks ended higher Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% closed up 107.45 points, or 0.5%, at a record 20,611.86; the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% finished up 11.67 points, or 0.5%, at a record 2,349.25; and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.07% gained 36.87 points, or 0.6%, to close at a record 5,819.44.
The last time all three benchmarks closed at records for five consecutive sessions was back on Jan. 2, 1992. They went on to do it again for a sixth day in a row in a streak that ended on Jan. 3, according to Dow Jones data.
Back on Jan. 3, 1992, the Dow industrials reached a then-record close of 3,201.50, the S&P 500 topped out at 419.34, and the Nasdaq reached 592.65.
“Back in 1992, the crash of 1987 was still fresh in everyone's minds,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “In hindsight, we were halfway through a bull market and at that time valuations were still reasonable contrasting with today.”
Nolte said valuations are now in about the top tenth percentile than they have ever been in history, and to say that we are halfway though the current bull market would be a mistake.
“Markets are still in the honeymoon phase and giving [President Donald] Trump a pretty wide berth,” Nolte said.
“It's a lot of different market now,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, in an interview. “1992 was before the tech bubble, we didn't have the housing bubble. This market is being fueled by different things, but mainly the prospect of economic growth being brought back to the market.”
The Dow industrials are certainly a different group than they were 25 years ago: Less than half the Dow components from 1992 are still on the average.

It's been almost five weeks since Donald Trump's victory in Indiana made him the presumptive Republican nominee.
Here's what's happened since: He's wasted time, proved to be a sore winner and veered sharply off message. He's put a higher premium on settling scores than finding a script that will appeal to a wider, general-election audience. Will it cost him?
Trump no doubt takes comfort in national polls that show a close contest against Hillary Clinton. Over the past month, her lead has shrunk dramatically. Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump than she does, although the senator from Vermont has no easy way of becoming the Democratic nominee. Trump, who consumes polls like candy, must like what he sees, but he should still be asking how he gets to an electoral college majority.
For Trump, this could have been a time for magnanimity and for beginning to show that he wants to reach beyond the loyal and passionate base of supporters that sustained him through the primaries. The electorate in the general election will be different and decidedly more diverse than the one that made him the GOP standard-bearer. So far, he's shown no willingness to acknowledge that.
Trump can't seem to let go of any perceived slight or grievance. He can't accept the idea of winning graciously. He still feels disrespected, by fellow Republicans and especially the media. He feels he hasn't gotten all the credit he deserves. He thinks that even some of his losses during the nomination battle were worthy of more praise than he got at the time.

Every nominee goes through bad stretches. It's in the nature of the business. Clinton has had hers and will have more. But it's hard to think of any previous presumptive nominee who has suffered through such a rocky period in the weeks after claiming the nomination. In the aftermath of a remarkable achievement, he has seemed as angry as ever and at times off stride.
Over the past five weeks, Trump has come under ever-closer scrutiny, as is customary for the nominee of a major political party. Close inspection of past decisions, actions and records is part of the process of helping voters understand who might become the next president. Trump has recoiled at what is normal and necessary.
[Trump attacks media over veterans fundraising questions]
The run of stories about Trump has been unrelenting, raising questions about his business acumen, which hit especially close to home for someone who has been celebrated as the embodiment of success. One article described him as a celebrity businessman who posed secretly as his own PR agent. Another revealed that the candidate who refuses to release his tax returns paid no taxes years ago, according to a 1981 New Jersey gambling regulatory report.
Trump also was hit with tough questions, many from The Washington Post's David A. Fahrenthold, about whether he had lived up to his claim of raising $6 million for veterans at an event in Iowa this past January. It turned out that one missing million-dollar donation was his own. Pressed on the fundraising pledge to veterans, he held a news conference to provide details and then used most of the time to vilify the media.
Newly released documents from a lawsuit alleging fraud by Trump University raised other troubling questions about the practices of officials at that institution. Trump insists he will win that suit. But he opened a new avenue of attacks by going after the Mexican heritage of U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is based in San Diego and is overseeing the case.
Under fire for doing so, he ramped up his attacks, first in an interview with the Wall Street Journal and then in another with CNN's Jake Tapper. He accused Curiel, who was born in the United States, of bias against him because, he said, the judge's heritage conflicts with Trump's proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border. He rejected assertions that what he was doing was the very definition of racism.
View Graphic Many in the GOP were wary of Trump. They're coming around.
As he has engaged in these battles, he has begun to feel the full force of the Clinton campaign and its allies. On Thursday, Clinton delivered what was billed as a major foreign policy address. It was actually a purely political attack against Trump, albeit one effectively crafted and delivered for maximum impact.
He and his supporters believe that Clinton has gotten a free pass in comparison to the scrutiny he's now receiving. Clinton has drawn considerable scrutiny over the course of her campaign, with some questions still to be addressed. She has been the focus of a series of damaging stories in the media about her private email server, has been criticized by a State Department inspector general's report, and is still under FBI investigation. Trump has reached his own verdict. Clinton, he said, “has to go to jail.”
[Democrats fear violence at Trump rallies will help him]
Trump has had success in bringing more and more Republican elected officials to his side, if not exactly uniting the party. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) finally said Thursday that he would vote for Trump in November. Then on Friday, Ryan had to disavow what Trump had said about Curiel. He said he would continue to take issue with Trump as necessary but added that he hopes that won't be often. The evidence suggests otherwise.
Trump can't resist airing his frustration with those still outside the tent. He needlessly attacked New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R), who admittedly has not said good things about him. Now he's done a 180-degree turn, telling the Santa Fe New Mexican that he wants her support and has always respected her.
Trump has allowed himself to become mired in these petty battles rather than pivoting to a general-election message and strategy. He's spent needless time in California ahead of the state's Tuesday primary, which will have no bearing on the GOP nomination, rather than concentrating on swing states he must convert in order to be competitive in the electoral college.
He claims he will put California in play in November. California hasn't voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988. In the past six elections, Republicans have lost California by 13, 13, 12, 10, 24 and 23 points.
The latest Field Poll shows him losing California to Clinton by 19 points and to Sanders by 29 points. Yet the most significant thing Trump has done campaigning in the state is to attack Curiel, risking further backlash from a Hispanic community whose power in elections continues to rise.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said several times in recent days that he worries that Trump could do to Hispanics what Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign did to African Americans. Goldwater's opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 turned African Americans into the most solid bloc of voters in the Democratic coalition.
Everyone says it's early, that the general election is still months away, that Clinton can't even shake off Sanders, that Democrats could have a tumultuous convention, that fear of Clinton will unify all Republicans and that will be enough to win. Maybe. What if the period between now and the conventions turns out to be the decisive phase in shaping and defining the choice for November? If that's the case, Trump has done little to help himself in the first weeks of that competition.
There was widespread disruption in Dublin this evening due to the taxi dispute which began this morning and then escalated.
Luas Red Line services were limited between Tallaght and Smithfield due to protests and many roads in the city are blocked.
Drivers finally ended their protest shortly before 10pm.
During rush hour, Pembroke Street, Fitzwilliam Square South and West were all blocked while O'Connell Street was closed due to traffic.
Northbound traffic had to be diverted onto Eden Quay while southbound traffic from Parnell Square was diverted via Marlborough Street and Gardiner Street. Buses that usually stop[ed on O'Connell Street northbound were forced to detour onto Parnell Square West with southbound buses stopping on Parnell Square East.
Taxi drivers across the country withdrew their services today in support of a sit-in by two members of the Irish Taxi Council (ITC) at the Commission of Taxi Regulation offices. The ITC is demanding a cap on the number of taxi drivers in the industry.
A small group identifying themselves as ITC representatives forced entry to commission's office at Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, yesterday afternoon and refused to leave the lobby area. It is understood that up to seven taxi drivers were initially involved in the sit-in, but just two remained in the office today.
The High Court today ordered the protestors to stop occupying the regulator's offices.
Ms Justice Mary Laffoy granted an interim injunction restraining trespass on the Commission for Taxi Regulation's offices by members of the ITC, including Thomas Barton and Patrick Walsh, who occupied the building last night. The judge also ordered no member of the ITC may go within 30 metres of the two entrances to the regulator's offices, pending further order of the court.
The two men who remained inside the office ended their protest this evening.
A demonstration in support of the drivers was called in Dublin this morning with up to 500 drivers withdrawing their service at Dublin airport from 8am. Drivers in Cork, Waterford, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo and Donegal joined the protest and withdrew their service later in the day.
This afternoon, Frank Byrne of the ITC said the protesters were seeking full implementation of the 11-point-plan recommended by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport that he said had been "ignored by the Minister for Transport".
President of the Irish Taxi Drivers' Federation John Ussher, whose organisation was not involved in planning today's protest, said: "All the organisations have one thing in common. We all want what's best for taxi drivers. Where we differ is how we achieve what's best."
A spokesman for Mr Dempsey said this afternoon that protests do not address the challenges faced by drivers and urged them to resume discussions with the taxi regulator, whom he said was mandated to regulate the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry.
“Those involved in the actions yesterday and which are continuing today are strongly urged to resume discussions with the Commission for Taxi Regulation in a sustained effort to address the issues of concern,” he said. “It is understood that the Commission for Taxi Regulation is having good and fruitful discussions with the other four groups representing taxi drivers. There is no reason why those involved in the current actions cannot have the same engagement.”
The spokesman accepted the industry, like all sectors of the economy, was facing severe challenges. “Taxi drivers are working in a competitive, challenging environment which has affected earning power,” he added. “The occupation of offices and other disruptive actions such as those at the airport, while attracting media attention, does nothing however to address the challenges which the industry is facing.”
Representatives of Siptu, the National Taxi Drivers' Union, the Irish Taxi Drivers' Federation and the Taxi and Hackeny Drivers' Association are due to meet on Thursday, and it is expected that today's events will be discussed at that meeting.

McDonald's Pokémon toys
Japanese McDonald's stores will once more be giving away Pokémon toys in their Happy Meals, the Pokémon Company has reported.
Toys depicting Pikachu, Victini, Thundurus, and Zekrom will be given away starting Dec. 16. Oshawott, Reshiram, Landorus, and Tornadus toys will be given away starting Dec. 23. The event is currently scheduled to last about three weeks.
This is not the first McDonald's promotional campaign this year for the Pokémon franchise. In June and July, twelve different Pokémon Cards were given away as a part of the McDonald's Collection and eight toys were given away as a part of the 2011 McDonald's Promotional Pokémon Toys.
In related news, the official Pokémon calendar for 2012 is now on sale. It comes with a sheet of stickers for all of the Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex and can be bought at Japanese McDonald's stores. This calendar is a traditional end-of-year promotion and once received a Guinness World Record.
Update: A Danish McDonald's promotion is also currently running. Beginning on Dec. 9 and ending Jan. 6, six Pokémon figures can be collected with Happy Meals. This is not the same promotion as is presently available in Japan and is partnered with a Little Pony: Friendship is Magic promotion.
If you're driving on the highway in Virginia, don't be surprised if you soon see a car in your rear-view mirror with no one behind the wheel.
Virginia announced Monday that it's opening up 70 miles of highway for self-driving car testing according to a report in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The roads designated for testing will be known as the Virginia Automated Corridors and include some of the most congested stretches of highway in the U.S.
Virginia is the latest U.S. state to allow testing of self-driving cars on public roads after California, Nevada, Florida and Michigan, as well as Washington, D.C.
If you happen to be an automaker interested in testing in Virginia you'll need to certify the safety of their vehicles with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) on either their Smart Road facility or at Virginia International Raceway before they will be granted permission to test on public roads. Oh, and Google's steering wheel-free Koala car need not apply, since it's required that a driver must be in the car to take control if need be (although Google's other self-driving cars, like the one pictured above, are theoretically welcome).
Virginia is stepping up as a driverless-car testing ground to attract companies to set up shop in the area, which would in turn help its economy. Designers of driverless cars will likely be interested since the new stretch of highway represents and opportunity to test their cars in new conditions, which will help them evolve their products.
As of now, no self-driving carmakers have publicly announced plans to start testing in Virginia, but Maya Blanco, director of Automated Vehicle Systems at VTTI, predicts autonomous cars will be on the state's highways in about a year, according to the Times-Dispatch.
Michigan's Denard Robinson had an amazing collegiate career.
It's obvious if he wishes to entertain the notion of playing professionally, it would be at a position other than the one that lines up under center.
In 2002, another Big 10 athletic quarterback made a similar switch; from quarterback to receiver. Antwaan Randle El, who was also a point guard on Indiana's basketball team, played wide receiver a bit, giving Indiana a chance to maximize Randle El's athleticism on the field.
Robinson paid attention to that, and recently told reporters he studied tape of Randle El and how he made the transition from passer to receiver.
Perhaps most importantly for Robinson, he noted Randle El's return ability - probably the main reason the Steelers drafted the dynamic Randle El in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft. Robinson will look to show scouts his return abilities as well as his his receiving game at the Combine.
He'll be on display today with the other receivers, and while Robinson isn't expected to be selected higher than Tennessee's Cordarrelle Patterson or West Virginia's Tavon Austin, he brings with him perhaps more intrigue than any other prospect at the draft.
Open field running ability and multi-position capability will usually do that for a player.

In case you were too amazed by Russell Westbrook tying Oscar Robertson's single-season triple-double record, our Masters quiz and everything else going on in sports earlier this week and missed Roy Williams reading a hilarious text that Michael Jordan sent him, here's what it said.
Williams said Jordan, who wasn't at the championship game, sent him this message after the Tar Heels beat Gonzaga:
“I'm so happy for you and the team. You raised the ceiling to the roof tonight. Congrats, didn't want to bring you bad luck tonight, but I'm so happy for you. Love you, my man.”
Roy Williams reads the text Michael Jordan sent him and also announces a new shirt coming, "Ceiling! Roof! Champions!" Can't wait to buy 1! pic.twitter.com/NdyWiPo662 — Cedric M. Bullock (@jordan23ww) April 5, 2017
The “You raised the ceiling to the roof” part is the big joke.
In early March, Jordan spoke during halftime of a Tar Heels basketball game to talk about how his brand is sponsoring their football team, and during his speech he misspoke and said, “The ceiling is the roof.” He was roasted on Twitter afterwards, but he also turned it into an opportunity to make more money with shirts that said, “Ceiling. Roof. GOAT.”
As Williams mentioned after reading the text, they made newer shirts that now say, “Ceiling. Roof. Champion.” I'm starting to think Jordan asked Williams to read that text aloud. He's a genius.

All throughout the 2016 season, NFL.com writers were tweeting out statistics about play length, maximum speed, and other numbers that simply weren't available to the common sports viewer like you or me.
Today, that's changed.
The NFL's “next gen stats,” including things like the league's fastest ball carriers (DeSean Jackson was third in the league at a peak speed of 22.6 MPH, which DEAR GOD), charts that show the trajectory of wide receivers' routes throughout an entire game, and much more.
If you're an NBA fan, and you've been able to play around with SportVU technology on the NBA site over the past couple years, this is very much akin to that stuff. Some of it is immediately accessible and valuable. Some of it is probably just noise. And some of these stats are probably going to take a little more time to figure out how to properly work into discussions of value and strategy.
But that's one of the fun parts of the NFL, and sports in general, in 2017: we're figuring out new ways to consume things, to understand things, and to evaluate things.
So jump in, mess around with those sliders, and look at numbers telling you how fast these athletic freaks are compared to your average human self.
Oh, and don't forget to look at the air distance and air yards NFL.com has so graciously compiled, because it proves how completely and utterly useless the argument in favor of air yards was by football commentators who will remain nameless.
A sampling...
But, you know, let's keep telling quarterbacks to just launch the ball down the field with reckless abandon and not consider literally everything else at work in the offense.
Hopefully, with these new, super fancy statistics, we can help people avoid sounding like such dummies in the future.
Webmaster level: AllGoogle has said before that search engine optimization, or SEO, can be positive and constructive —and we're not the only ones . Effective search engine optimization can make a site more crawlable and make individual pages more accessible and easier to find. Search engine optimization includes things as simple as keyword research to ensure that the right words are on the page, not just industry jargon that normal people will never type.“White hat” search engine optimizers often improve the usability of a site, help create great content, or make sites faster, which is good for both users and search engines. Good search engine optimization can also mean good marketing: thinking about creative ways to make a site more compelling, which can help with search engines as well as social media. The net result of making a great site is often greater awareness of that site on the web, which can translate into more people linking to or visiting a site.The opposite of “white hat” SEO is something called “black hat webspam” (we say “webspam” to distinguish it from email spam). In the pursuit of higher rankings or traffic, a few sites use techniques that don't benefit users, where the intent is to look for shortcuts or loopholes that would rank pages higher than they deserve to be ranked. We see all sorts of webspam techniques every day, from keyword stuffing to link schemes that attempt to propel sites higher in rankings.The goal of many of our ranking changes is to help searchers find sites that provide a great user experience and fulfill their information needs. We also want the “good guys” making great sites for users, not just algorithms, to see their effort rewarded. To that end we've launched Panda changes that successfully returned higher-quality sites in search results . And earlier this year we launched a page layout algorithm that reduces rankings for sites that don't make much content available “above the fold.”In the next few days, we're launching an important algorithm change targeted at webspam. The change will decrease rankings for sites that we believe are violating Google's existing quality guidelines . We've always targeted webspam in our rankings, and this algorithm represents another improvement in our efforts to reduce webspam and promote high quality content. While we can't divulge specific signals because we don't want to give people a way to game our search results and worsen the experience for users, our advice for webmasters is to focus on creating high quality sites that create a good user experience and employ white hat SEO methods instead of engaging in aggressive webspam tactics.Here's an example of a webspam tactic like keyword stuffing taken from a site that will be affected by this change:Of course, most sites affected by this change aren't so blatant. Here's an example of a site with unusual linking patterns that is also affected by this change. Notice that if you try to read the text aloud you'll discover that the outgoing links are completely unrelated to the actual content, and in fact the page text has been “spun” beyond recognition:Sites affected by this change might not be easily recognizable as spamming without deep analysis or expertise, but the common thread is that these sites are doing much more than white hat SEO; we believe they are engaging in webspam tactics to manipulate search engine rankings.The change will go live for all languages at the same time. For context, the initial Panda change affected about 12% of queries to a significant degree; this algorithm affects about 3.1% of queries in English to a degree that a regular user might notice. The change affects roughly 3% of queries in languages such as German, Chinese, and Arabic, but the impact is higher in more heavily-spammed languages. For example, 5% of Polish queries change to a degree that a regular user might notice.We want people doing white hat search engine optimization (or even no search engine optimization at all) to be free to focus on creating amazing, compelling web sites. As always, we'll keep our ears open for feedback on ways to iterate and improve our ranking algorithms toward that goal.
﻿- [Woman] This dish is full of so many amazing things. First of all, avocado, and if you know me at all you know that I love avocado. Also, roasted broccoli is this beautiful magical thing that happens when you put broccoli in the oven. The flavor is just out of control and if you've never had roasted broccoli, this dish is your chance to try it. I found out about this dish from Clotilde, she's a French food blogger, her blog is Chocolate and Zucchini. Hat tip to you, Clotilde. I love Brussels sprouts too, so I add Brussels sprouts to this dish too. Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, avocado, it's going to be a green bowl of delight. So first we just start by chopping up our veggies here. You wanna try and get these, give or take, the same size so that they roast evenly. Don't throw the stem part away, keep it, because that's gonna roast up beautifully as well. I'm gonna use some of this stem here too, because don't let anything go to waste, right? We're gonna put some parchment paper down. And then we're going to tackle our Brussels sprouts. So I've already rinsed both of these vegetables, so they're ready to just be chopped up. We don't want the little end butt of our Brussels sprouts. Why would you call it a Brussels sprout stem when you can call it a Brussels sprout butt? Okay then you're going to cut the Brussels sprouts in half. Brussels sprouts go on the pan. Generously add olive oil, kosher salt, a bit of pepper. I like a little kick in my roasted vegetables, goes really well with the tahini, red pepper flakes. All right and then just toss. Which means get your hands dirty. Now this goes in the oven, 400 degrees, for about 40 minutes. While that's in the oven let's make our tahini sauce. It's super simple and so, so good. I love the nuttiness of tahini. You only need a couple tablespoons for this so, let's pour that in. And juice from half a lemon. I just like to squeeze the lemon over my hand like this because it catches any seeds, it's faster than using a citrus squeezer. All right and we're gonna add a pinch of salt as well. And we're gonna add our herbs too but first let's combine this. Nice and creamy. Now, let's chop up our parsley. But really you can use like any fresh herb you have on hand. Chives, cilantro, you just want one handful of parsley. I'm just gonna chop it up. Just roughly, don't spend too much time on this. Gonna add a little bit of water to this. You can determine how thick you want your dressing. I love roasted vegetables. When you roast them you bring out their inherent sweetness and it's so good. Okay now we add the avocado. This is my favorite part of the recipe. Cut her open. And my favorite way to take this little guy out, is just to use the same knife I already have in my hand. Boop, and twist. Out it comes. And just plop the avocado out with its green friends. I've let the vegetables cool a bit before I toss them with the avocado. You don't wanna over toss it, because then the avocado starts to fall apart and kinda makes a mess so, just a light couple tosses, and then put it in the serving dish. And top with our tahini parsley dressing. And now my favorite part of the video, when I get to eat. Don't forget guys, keep it quirky.
— A 4-year-old boy is in the fight of his young life after he was shot in the chest during a botched robbery in the Bronx.
Police said the gunman, identified as 17-year-old Mauricio Acosta, pulled the trigger while trying to steal an old coat that belonged to the boy's father.
The father was bringing his son, 4-year-old Cencia Balthazzar, back to the women's shelter where the toddler lives with his mother on Grand Avenue around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday when police said Acosta and two other teenagers tried to rob them.
1010 WINS' Carol D'Auria reports one person is in custody https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/2-shot-2-dauria-w42-sdmiller.mp3
Sources told 1010 WINS' Carol D'Auria the father and Acosta apparently got into a struggle and the gun went off shooting the young boy in the chest.
“I have seen the baby. The legs were spread apart and the mom was trying to hold her or him, whatever it was. The baby wasn't moving at all,” witness Neftali Negron told CBS 2's Kristin Thorne.
CBS 2's Pablo Guzman reports two young men rushed the boy to get medical attention. The child was transferred from St. Barnabas Hospital to Columbia-Presbyterian. Investigators say he has lost consciousness three times.
Police said the father wrestled a gun away from one of the alleged muggers and ran after one of the suspects, shooting the teen in the back of the head.
Officers found the 17-year-old alleged assailant shot nearby at Grand Avenue and Evelyn Place.
“He was saying ‘Please I need help. I need help. Somebody call an ambulance.' I called the ambulance,” one witness said.
He was listed in critical condition at Saint Barnabas Hospital.
Guzman reports police have tracked down the third suspect.
Police are questioning the father.

findViewById(int) is an essential and ubiquitous method call that plods in your Activities, Views, Fragments and Adapters. It sometimes goes out of control but can be tamed with projects like Butter Knife, InjectView or Android Annotations. Being verbose and slow, the results should be cached when used frequently and hence the ViewHolder pattern.
Sometimes, the number of lines of code could be as little as a Compsognathus or could grow large and wild like a T. rex. Check it out for yourself.
Regular Code
private EditText mEmailEditText; private EditText mPasswordEditText; private EditText mConfirmPasswordEditText; private Spinner mAgeSpinner; private Spinner mCountrySpinner; private Spinner mStateOrProvinceSpinner; private CheckBox mIAgreeCheckBox; private Button mRegisterButton; protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.id.activity_register); mEmailEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.emailEditText); mPasswordEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.passwordEditText); mConfirmPasswordEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.confirmPasswordEditText); mAgeSpinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.ageSpinner); mCountrySpinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.countrySpinner); mStateOrProvinceSpinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.stateOrProvinceSpinner); mIAgreeCheckBox = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.iAgreeCheckBox); mRegisterButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.registerButton); }
All my hard work can be explained in a simple sentence – obtain references to my views. The problem is mitigated when using a view binding library, but you still need visible field declarations.
Butter Knife
@InjectView(R.id.emailEditText) EditText mEmailEditText; @InjectView(R.id.passwordEditText) EditText mPasswordEditText; @InjectView(R.id.confirmPasswordEditText) EditText mConfirmPasswordEditText; @InjectView(R.id.ageSpinner) Spinner mAgeSpinner; @InjectView(R.id.countrySpinner) Spinner mCountrySpinner; @InjectView(R.id.stateOrProvinceSpinner) Spinner mStateOrProvinceSpinner; @InjectView(R.id.iAgreeCheckBox) CheckBox mIAgreeCheckBox; @InjectView(R.id.registerButton) Button mRegisterButton; protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.id.activity_register); ButterKnife.inject(this); }
Better, but still not subtle. This is the farthest Java can take you. Kotlin as a language itself could only take you so far.
Edit: Butter Knife doesn't stop here. It has several other features like listener injections, view lists, resource binding, nullifying view references, etc., If you are still using Java for development, it is your best bet.
With the not so advertised Kotlin Android Extensions by JetBrains, your code will look like this,
Kotlin Android Extensions
import kotlinx.android.synthetic.activity_register.* override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) setContentView(R.layout.activity_register) }
Is that all? Yeah, that's all of it 😉 and I am sober. CHECK. Notice the import statement.
import kotlinx.android.synthetic.<layout>.*
This statement imports all the widgets in the specified layout as properties. These view properties are named after their XML IDs and can be accessed directly. For instance, if you want to set a click listener for the register button. You can do,
registerButton.setOnClickListener(this) // R.id.registerButton

When college football teams line up in four- and five-wide sets, it is more often than not to throw the ball. In fact, the end result of those packages was a pass or sack more than two-thirds of the time in Football Study Hall's 2012 charting data.
Still, that leaves plenty of action on the ground. Runs take up a not-insignificant section of the pie chart below. Even guys like Mike Leach feel the need to hand the ball off every so often.
Running out of an empty or nearly-empty backfield comes with the benefit of a scattered defense looking to cover the outside. But that also comes without a lead blocker. How does that balance play out in the end?
It turns out that extra space is allowing for extra yardage on the ground. It's logical that quarterback runs would gain more, as the QB can survey the reaction of the defense and run to daylight, but running backs are having similar success without an extra blocker in the way.
Wide Receivers YPC (Non-QB) YPC (QB) YPC (Overall) Avg. Down Avg. Distance 1-3 4.97 5.48 5.04 1.64 7.99 4-5 5.71 6.86 5.96 1.75 8.72
As the table shows, QBs are gaining almost a yard-and-a-half extra when they hold on to the ball in four and five-wide sets. Overall, runs gain close to a yard more in the wideout-heavy sets.
It's not some new revelation that spread-type offenses with more wideouts tend to gain more yardage. They've been at the top of the NCAA offensive rankings for years. However, that has been primarily on the back of the pass. The teams that run out of the spread (like Oregon) use plenty of tight ends and multiple-back sets.
The chart below (sorry about the small print) shows that YPC trends upward until a fifth wide receiver is added.
Does this mean teams should consider leaning more towards more wideouts and less running backs when they want to pick up yardage on the ground? Well, it isn't quite that simple.
Of course, part of the success that stems from running out of these passing personnel groupings is just that -- it tends to catch the defense by surprise, and the average down and distance in the table above could be telling.
Runs out of four and five-wide sets are coming with more yards needed for a first down, and likely more often coming in typical passing downs. Defenses aren't just leaning towards the pass because of the formation, they are doing so because a pass makes more sense in the average situation.
Still, it is a positive sign for pass-heavy spread attacks that running without tight ends and fullbacks isn't hindering their ability to pick up yardage on the ground, at least in a typical situation.
It's time to scratch another name off the Philadelphia Eagles' list of defensive coordinator candidates. According to Nick Fierro of The Morning Call, former Browns head coach Mike Pettine is out of the mix. The Bucks County native was fired by Cleveland after the 2015 season ended in early January.
Doug Pederson reportedly targeted Steve Spagnuolo as his top choice for defensive coordinator but it appears that won't be happening. The Eagles requested permission to talk to Spags but the Giants denied them and now he's staying with New York. Spags probably wasn't a good choice anyway considering how bad his defenses have been so the Giants saved the Eagles from themselves in this situation. How nice of Ben McAdoo.
With Pettine and Spags out of the mix, the Eagles will have to look elsewhere. Jim Schwartz has reportedly been in contact with the Eagles. The former Detroit Lions head coach is reportedly interviewing with the Jacksonville Jaguars for their vacancy.
Is losing weight as simple as doing a 15-minute writing exercise? In a new study published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, women who wrote about their most important values, like close relationships, music, or religion, lost more weight over the next few months than women who did not have that experience.
"We have this need to feel self-integrity," says Christine Logel of Renison University College at the University of Waterloo, who cowrote the new study with Geoffrey L. Cohen of Stanford University. When something threatens your sense that you're a good person, like failing a test or having a fight with a friend, "We can buffer that self-integrity by reminding ourselves how much we love our children, for example," she says.
For this study, the researchers recruited 45 female undergraduates who had a body mass index of 23 or higher. A body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight; 58% of the women were overweight or obese. Each woman was weighed, and was then given a list of important values, like creativity, politics, music, and relationships with friends and family members. Each woman ranked the values in order of how important they were to her. Then half the women were told to write for 15 minutes about the value that was most important to her. The other half, a control group, were told to write about why a value far down on their list might be important to someone else.
The women came back between one and four months later to be weighed again. Women who had written about an important value lost an average of 3.41 pounds, while women in the control group gained an average of 2.76 pounds, a pattern of weight gain that is typical for undergraduates.
"How we feel about ourselves can have a big effect," Logel says. "We think it sort of kicks off a recursive process." Maybe when one of the women who wrote about an important value went home that night, she felt good about herself and didn't eat to make herself feel better. Then the next day snacking wasn't as much of a habit, so she skipped it. Over a few months, that could make a real difference in her life.
Many studies have found that even briefly thinking about values can have a big effect on situations where people feel a threat to their integrity. For example, Cohen used the same technique on minority seventh-graders who were underperforming relative to their white peers. Those who did the exercise were still performing better years later.
It's too soon to say whether this could work for everybody; the women in the study didn't know that writing about values was supposed to help them live better (although they may have wondered why this psychology study required a weigh-in).
"My dream, and my research goal, is to get this to the point where people can do it deliberately to benefit themselves," Logel says. In the meantime, she carries around a keychain that reminds her of a value that she considers to be important. And everyone else can do that, too. "There's certainly no harm in taking time to reflect on important values and working activities you value into your daily life," Logel says.

GOP presidential nominee John McCain said today that if elected he would send U.S. troops to South America in order to invade "one of America's deadliest enemies," Spain.
Sen. McCain accused Spain of "picking a fight" with the U.S. in recent days, but warned that their "aggression and bellicosity will not stand."
"Spain can run, but it cannot hide," he told his audience at a rally in St. Louis. "I am fully prepared to invade Spain, and if that means sending troops to South America, where Spain is located, then so be it."
The Arizona senator seemed momentarily caught off-guard when a reporter suggested that Spain might be located in Europe, and not in South America, but Mr. McCain soon shot back, calling the reporter's comment "naïve."
"That's the old kind of thinking that I'm going to change when I get to Washington," Sen. McCain said. "My friends, when I am President, I will redraw the map."
His running mate, Alaska governor Sarah Palin, agreed with Sen. McCain's placement of Spain on the world map, telling the St. Louis crowd that "Spain is much closer than any of us realize."
"If you stand on the southern border of Mexico and get up on your tippy-toes, you can practically see it," she said.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, citing his own Jewish heritage, said he understood the long history of violence and hatred against Jews and other minorities. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo Mnuchin, facing calls for resignation, defends Trump
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday defended President Donald Trump and called out his critics amid growing condemnation of the president's response to racist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.
"I don't believe the allegations against the president are accurate," Mnuchin said in a statement. "I believe that having highly talented men and women in our country surrounding the president in his administration should be reassuring to you and all the American people."
Story Continued Below
Earlier this week, a group of Mnuchin's fellow Yale alumni drafted a letter saying it was his "moral obligation" to resign "in protest of President Trump's support of Nazism and white supremacy." Trump was criticized after the Charlottesville incident for saying "both sides" were to blame for the unrest.
Mnuchin on Saturday condemned the actions of "those filled with hate and with the intent to harm others."
Citing his own Jewish heritage, he said he understood the long history of violence and hatred against Jews and other minorities.
"While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways," he said.
Mnuchin said he was "familiar with the culture wars being fought in our country."
"Some of these issues are far more complicated than we are led to believe by the mass media, and if it were so simple, such actions would have been taken by other presidents, governors, and mayors, long before President Trump was elected by the American people," he said.

Mnuchin then went after Trump's critics.
"Our president deserves the opportunity to propose his agenda and to do so without the attempts by those who opposed him in the primaries, in the general election and beyond to distract the administration and the American people from these most important policy issues – jobs, economic growth, and national security," he said.

Ok...what more can I add to this world that we haven't already seen masterfully represented by Peter Jackson's films? Seriously...why bother!? Well, here's how it started. I've been fairly obsessed with the use of line in my artwork over the last few years. This was after the mixed (ok, maybe I'm being generous) reception the CGI comic covers I did for DC came out. I was always a traditional artist before I entered the world of 3D animation and games. More specifically, I was a painter. So, as things usually come back around...I've decided to start relying less online and get back to my roots. The recent iPad paintings I've been doing helped me come to this. As for Gandalf here...I just wanted to do something that isn't represented well in my portfolio. Fantasy. I guess this is Gandalf sometime before LOTR, but after The Hobbit.Also...thanks to this gentleman for looking like a real wizard and providing great reference to be a jumping off point for my Gandalf....

British scientists who have set up a network of penguin-monitoring cameras in Antarctica are asking the public to help them carry out their research.
The Oxford University team is launching a new version of their ambitious project, PenguinWatch, on Thursday.
This is now the largest Antarctic citizen science venture in the world.
In "PenguinWatch 2.0", people will be able to see the results of their online efforts to monitor and conserve Antarctica's penguins colonies.
Lead researcher Dr Tom Hart is also encouraging school groups to adopt their own colony - following and monitoring its progress and "learning about Antarctica along the way."
"We've been really good at engaging people, but we've not been that good at feeding back," he told BBC News.
Every click counts
"The new part is that people will be able to see [the results of] what they're doing"
The team now has more than 75 cameras all over Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands.

Their monitoring work - including a collaboration with a penguin census that has been operated by US organisation Oceanites since 1994 - has already shown a link between climate change and a decline in Adelie and Chinstrap penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula.
But with their large camera network in place, and each camera automatically taking a picture every hour throughout the year, the researchers now have a backlog of hundreds of thousands of images they are yet to analyse.
"We can't do this work on our own, and every penguin that people click on and count on the website - that's all information that tells us what's happening at each nest, and what's happening over time," said Dr Hart.

The team will combine this year-round view of the wildlife with climate, pollution and fisheries data - to work out what is driving declines in penguin populations, and how those declines might be reversed.

We all know how awesome the Gymkhana Practice Video and Gymkhana Two Informercial are from Ken Block. And it was only a matter of time before a spoof video was released, but oh man, what a job the folks at IMV Films have done! This thing is part jackass, part wanton-abondonment for-public-safety and pure fun from start to finish. These guys have it all — paintball shooting, fireworks dodging, train track jumping, loads of moving violations, baby smashing and trailer destroying — with lots of “dynamic” driving thrown in the loop.
IMV Films prove that you don't need a Crawford Performance 530 whp car, a high-end production crew and an entire airfield to make a hype video. Just a beat up WRX Impreza, a couple of sets of tires and a creative imagination is all that's required. If you like this kinda stuff also peep Vehicular Lunatics or Team Tork and the Scumballers from the same production shop. Anyhow, check out the Gymkhana Spoof video after the jump:

The conversations started in training camp and then took on added importance over the last week.
Veterans Bismack Biyombo, Jeff Green and Serge Ibaka, among others, spoke to young Mario Hezonja individually when he asked for advice or when they saw things he can improve. The talks intensified after Hezonja struggled throughout the Magic's first five regular-season games. The team needs him to succeed on the court, and the chats were intended to help Hezonja fulfill his potential.
"I'm a great listener," Hezonja said, smiling.
Apparently so.
Hezonja played his best game of the season by far as the Magic defeated the Washington Wizards 88-86 Saturday night.
Hezonja, Biyombo and Green keyed a fourth-quarter comeback that started with a jumper by Hezonja off a pindown coach Frank Vogel called for him. Hezonja scored eight of his nine points in the final period and fit perfectly with the Magic's high-energy second unit. One play — his steal of an errant pass and his subsequent coast-to-coast, two-handed dunk — may have been the highlight of the night.

Orlando Magic President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman talks about the decision to trade with the Philadelphia 76ers for the 2017 No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz.
His team needed him to provide a boost. Hezonja faltered throughout Orlando's first five games, averaging 4.2 points per game on 26.7 percent shooting. Team officials envisioned a higher level of play when they selected him fifth overall in the 2015 NBA Draft, six spots ahead of up-and-coming big man Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers and eight spots ahead of sweet-shooting swingman Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns.
At only 21 years old, Hezonja is nowhere close to a finished product. But the present-day Magic, with their suspect outside shooting, need him to provide scoring off the bench and need him to step up his defense.
Not tomorrow. But now.
"The kid is talented," Biyombo said. "Sometimes, you want to do too good. Obviously, it happens to all of us. But we all got to do a better job of helping him and positioning him in the right place to be successful. People have done it for all of us, and we all got to do the same for him."
One of the lessons Magic veterans and coaches are trying to teach Hezonja, a 6-foot-8 swingman, is that he can influence games even when he misfires with his shooting.
"I want to make sure he's not allowing his missed shots to impact the other elements of the game," Vogel said.
"In fact, it should impact it in a positive way. When you're not making shots, you have to find other ways to impact the game: with your energy, with your hustle, with your defense. I want him concentrating really hard on those areas and then letting the offense come to him."
On Thursday night, during a win over the Sacramento Kings, he demonstrated that he may be absorbing the message. With Orlando leading 39-35 in the second quarter and Sacramento pushing forward in transition, the Kings' Omri Casspi had a clear path to the hoop. But Hezonja didn't give up on the play. He pursued Casspi from behind, elevated and challenged the layup attempt. Casspi missed the shot.
Vogel replayed that sequence to the entire team the following day, just like Vogel does whenever someone makes a recovery play in transition defense.
Last season, Hezonja averaged 17.9 minutes per game under coach Scott Skiles as Skiles attempted to teach Hezonja that defense matters as much as offense. Skiles sought to make Hezonja accountable for missing defensive assignments.
So far this season, Hezonja is averaging 16.3 minutes under Vogel, and Vogel is trying to teach the same lesson.
Even in Saturday night's decisive fourth quarter, with Washington leading 70-63, Hezonja appeared to make a defensive error.
As the Wizards held the ball near the left edge of the lane, Hezonja drifted too far above free-throw line, leaving his man, Kelly Oubre Jr., wide open on the right wing. Instead, Hezonja should have positioned himself at the center of the free-throw line, where he could've recovered if the Wizards sent the ball to Oubre.
The Wizards hurled a pass to Oubre, and Hezonja was a bit slow to close out. Oubre sank a 3-pointer.
"He's a work in progress with the defense and the habits of taking care of the basketball and being in the right spot on the defensive end," Vogel said. "He's got to get that down tight for his minutes to go up. And when his minutes go up, the ball's going to start going in for him."
But Vogel and Hezonja have an advantage this season that Skiles and Hezonja didn't have last season: veteran players.
Biyombo, Green, Ibaka, D.J. Augustin, Jodie Meeks and C.J. Watson are on the roster now, while only Channing Frye, Jason Smith and Watson were around at this time last year.
Biyombo, Green and Ibaka have extensive playoff experience, and their voices resonate.
"Last year, pretty much everybody was my age," Hezonja said. "We didn't have anybody to learn from on the team. Even Channing is not that old. He had a lot of experience, but he's not that old.
"Especially now, with the guys being around the NBA for so long — being in the conference finals, being in The Finals — it means a lot. When you listen to them, you see the purpose. You have to listen to them. Their experience is really interesting for me. Actually, they're not coming up to me. I'm coming up to them to ask, 'How is everything going?' "
When Biyombo, Green and Ibaka arrived, they told the Magic's youngsters not to take constructive criticism personally.
"It's all for the good of the team, and it's all for the good of the person, and we're trying to get better," Green said. "And for Mario to accept criticism and to improve from that, that's big. Being in his second year, you see the steps and the leaps that he's had the last couple of games, and now his shot is falling. He's listening, and that's a good thing."
Everyone on the team has experienced stretches where shots don't fall and defensive mistakes seem to snowball.
No wonder veterans have been so eager to help him.
They also like him.
"When you're struggling, it's not fun," swingman Evan Fournier said. "It's not fun at all. You could tell Mario was really down. His confidence was down. He was not in a bad mood, but you could tell that he was not doing great. I'm really happy for him that he got it going. He made some huge plays for us and turned the game around and gave us momentum."
Now that Hezonja has showed what he can do, Magic players say they'll continue to stay in his ear.
And Hezonja says he'll continue to listen.

Up 'till now, the two favorite wingnut talking points about waterboarding have been a) "President Bush says we don't torture; therefore, waterboarding isn't torture!" and b) "Why, of course waterboarding isn't torture! I mean, it's just pouring a little water on someone!"
Well, they're both officially dead:
A leader of the CIA team that captured the first major al Qaeda figure, Abu Zubaydah, says subjecting him to waterboarding was torture but necessary.
But the authoritarian cultists see an opening! The guy said it was necessary — so we're all good!
Hey, "it's an ugly war." The people who keep us safe have to do bad shit sometimes, argues Jules Crittenden.
After all, it's only 35 seconds shruggs K-Lo.
And if this Congress outlaws waterboarding, innocent people will die! warns Ed Morrissey, apparently unaware that torture is already illegal in the United States. Oy.
I think the '08 RNC just found their slogan: "By any means necessary."
(Reuters) - Alaska officials reported an oil leak from an underwater pipeline late on Saturday that was within habitat designated as critical for endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales.
The leak originated from an eight-inch pipeline connecting two Hilcorp Energy production platforms in the Upper Cook Inlet. Hilcorp shut down both platforms following the leak and the pipeline are now operating at reduced pressure, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) said.
Hilcorp estimated that fewer than 10 gallons of oil have been released, but ADEC has not confirmed that figure, spill prevention and response director Kristin Ryan said on Sunday.
“We do not know if it's still leaking,” Ryan said.
“The reduced pressure should minimize the amount being released from the leak and we have not seen sheening since that time, but we have not been able to confirm.”
Hilcorp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The population of belugas that swim off the coast of Alaska's largest city was listed as endangered in 2008 by the federal government and more than 3,000 square miles have been protected as critical habitat since 2011.
The spill occurred in an area that is also home to other endangered mammals including the Steller sea lion and the humpback whale.
The ADEC has not seen any impact to wildlife yet. Three overhead flights were conducted on Saturday with no animals seen where sheening had occurred or near the pipeline, Ryan said.
The cause of the leak was unknown and being investigated, ADEC said. The line can hold 461 barrels of oil at full capacity.
Hilcorp last week shut two Alaskan oil production platforms after reducing pressure on a leaking natural gas pipeline in Cook Inlet. [nL2N1H50Z5]
The two incidents are unrelated, ADEC said.
The Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement on Sunday it had sent Hilcorp a 60-day notice of its intent to sue for the gas leak, and is monitoring the oil leak to determine whether additional legal action is warranted.
“We're really worried about what this means for Cook Inlet belugas with the double whammy of an oil spill and gas leak in the same season,” Miyoko Sakashita, oceans program director for the Center for Biological Diversity said in an emailed statement.
Hilcorp has hired a diving contactor to investigate the line and make repairs and it is anticipated that this work can be conducted late next week, ADEC said.
