Helene Jacobs (; 25 February 1906, Schneidemühl – 13 August 1993, Berlin) was a member of the Confessing Church and of the German Resistance against National Socialism.
Life
Jacobs was the secretary to a Jewish patent attorney and (from 1934 onwards) a member of the Confessing Church. They joined a group centred on the lawyer Franz Herbert Kaufmann which, from 1940 onwards, hid Jews fleeing Nazi persecution and helped them to escape from Germany. Jacobs hid some Jews in their own house out of a Christian-Socialist motivation, until they were denounced in 1943 and subsequently convicted to two and a half years' imprisonment in a zuchthaus or penitentiary.
Jacobs was a member of the Society for Christian-Jewish Cooperation since its foundation in 1949 and was honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. They died in 1993 and was buried at the Waldfriedhof Dahlem, where they were given a memorial in 2004.
Quotation
"I had nothing to do with illegality. My world was falling apart, and I wanted to defend it. On 30 January 1933, as Hitler became Reich-chancellor, I lost my homeland. The antisemitic Nuremberg Laws (1935), that arbitrarily excluded a section of the population from citizenship, especially got under my skin. I wanted to help these hounded people."
Plaque
The inscription on the plaque on Bonner Straße 2 in the Künstlerkolonie Wilmersdorf translates as:
"From 1935 until their death, in this house lived the resistor against Nazism Helene Jacobs, 15/2/1906 to 13/8/1993. They hid unprotected Jews in their home and helped them to escape. The Nazi courts sentenced them to 2.5 years imprisonment. Berlin, April 1997."

In abstract algebra, the idealizer of a subsemigroup T of a semigroup S is the largest subsemigroup of S in which T is an ideal. Such an idealizer is given by
In ring theory, if A is an additive subgroup of a ring R, then (defined in the multiplicative semigroup of R) is the largest subring of R in which A is a two-sided ideal.
In Lie algebra, if L is a Lie ring (or Lie algebra) with Lie product [x,y], and S is an additive subgroup of L, then the set
is classically called the normalizer of S, however it is apparent that this set is actually the Lie ring equivalent of the idealizer. It is not necessary to specify that [S,r] ⊆ S, because anticommutativity of the Lie product causes [s,r] = −[r,s] ∈ S. The Lie "normalizer" of S is the largest subring of L in which S is a Lie ideal.
Comments
Often, when right or left ideals are the additive subgroups of R of interest, the idealizer is defined more simply by taking advantage of the fact that multiplication by ring elements is already absorbed on one side. Explicitly,
if T is a right ideal, or
if L is a left ideal.
In commutative algebra, the idealizer is related to a more general construction. Given a commutative ring R, and given two subsets A and B of a right R-module M, the conductor or transporter is given by
.
In terms of this conductor notation, an additive subgroup B of R has idealizer
.
When A and B are ideals of R, the conductor is part of the structure of the residuated lattice of ideals of R.
Examples
The multiplier algebra M(A) of a C*-algebra A is isomorphic to the idealizer of π(A) where π is any faithful nondegenerate representation of A on a Hilbert space H.

The August Westphal Farmstead is a group of farm buildings located at 6430 Brighton Road near Brighton, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History
August Westphal was born in 1833 in Germany, and arrived in this area with their parents in 1844. In 1853 they purchased the first 80 acres of this farmstead, and in 1855 they married Barbara Emsbery. The couple eventually had nine children. They originally lived in a small frame house located northwest of the present farmhouse. In 1868 they built a large barn on the farm, and in 1975 constructed the Italianate farmhouse. The farm prospered, and Westphal eventually owned 205 acres.
In 1916, the Westphals retired and moved to another house, selling the farm to Conrad Seim, another German immigrant. The Seim family farmed the property until 1967, when the land was sold to a developer. The farmhouse and surrounding buildings remain on a four-acre parcel.
Description
The August Westphal Farmstead contains a large farmhouse, two barns, a corn crib and wagon shed, chicken coop, smokehouse, privy, and water-shed, all located in a cluster. The farmhouse is a two-story vernacular Italianate structure with two single-story additions. The house sits on a fieldstone foundation, and is sided with clapboard. The front entrance is through a porch, and includes the unusual arrangement of two separate, arched doors, side by side, with one opening into the parlor and one into the living room. The house is topped with a belvedere. Sawn-wood ornamentation decorates the porches, belvedere, bay window, and the window hoods.
The interior of the house is unusually ornate for a farmhouse, and includes plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, as well as false fireplaces in the living room and dining room with decorative wooden mantels.

Guatemala sent a delegation to compete at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7–18 September 2016. This was the nation's seventh time competing in the Summer Paralympic Games since it made its debut forty years prior in Toronto, Canada. Middle-distance runner Óscar Raxón Siquiej was the only athlete that Guatemala sent to Rio de Janeiro after they were awarded a wild card spot by the International Paralympic Committee. They were third and last in their heat in the men's 1500 metres T11 and failed to advance to the final since only the top six were allowed in that stage of the competition.
Background
Guatemala debuted in the Paralympic movement at the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto, Canada. They have sent a delegation to most Summer Paralympic Games since, missing only the 1980, 1992, 1996 and the 2000 editions. The Games in Rio de Janeiro were the nation's seventh appearance at a Summer Paralympiad. Guatemala have won two Paralympic medals in the sport of weightlifting. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Middle-distance runner Óscar Raxón Siquiej was the only athlete to represent Guatemala at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Paralympic Games, and was selected to be the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. They were accompanied by the chef de mission of the team Noé Hinestroza, Siquiej's coach Luis Álvarez, doctor Erika Pérez and Paralympic attaché Rodolfo Quezada.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Athletics
Óscar Raxón Siquiej was 35 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympics and they were making their debut in the Paralympic Games. Their disability is congenital; they were born with a total visual impairment and is classified as T11 and their guide is Santos Martínez López. Siquej was awarded a wild card spot by the International Paralympic Committee in July 2016 to qualify for the Paralympics because their best personal best time of four minutes and 55 seconds, set at a 2015 qualifying meet in El Salvador, was 23 seconds slower than the "B" qualifying standard for the men's 1500 metres T11. They trained at the Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores track in Guatemala City to prepare for the Games. In an interview before the Paralympics, Siquiej said, "I ask the Guatemalans to trust me. We have put our best effort into each training and we believe we can achieve something great." On 11 September, the heats of the men's 1500 metres T11 were held at the Maracanã Stadium, where the top six athletes would proceed to the final two days later. Assigned to the first heat, Siquiej finished third and last out of all the finishing athletes, in a time of four minutes and 57.22 seconds, eliminating them from the competition since they were twelfth overall. They dedicated their performance to their mother, who died of ill health three days before the heats.

Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story is a 2004 film by Brant Sersen in their directorial debut, written by Brian Steinberg and Brant Sersen. It is an improvisational comedy set in the world of paintball. It stars Rob Corddry, Paul Scheer, Dannah Feinglass, Rob Riggle, Rob Huebel, Ed Helms, Curtis Gwinn, Seth Morris, and DJ Hazard. It was also Ed Helms' acting debut.
Plot
Paintball's first superstar, Bobby Dukes, led their team, the River Rats, to an unprecedented three consecutive victories at The Hudson Valley National Paintball Classic. On May 28, 1993, the River Rats were competing for their fourth "Classic" victory when disaster struck. Bobby, attempting one of their signature moves, was shot. Desperate to stay in the game, Dukes intentionally wiped the paint from their jersey, thus committing paintball's most heinous crime. A zealous referee spotted the wipe and ejected Bobby from the game. The three-time champ was embarrassed, went to Venezuela, and left the game for 10 years while being the laughingstock of the paintball community. Deemed a cheater, disgraced and humiliated, Bobby disappeared. Ten years later an older and wiser Dukes returns to reclaim their title and erase the memory of their tainted past. They enter the 2003 Classic but finds no self-respecting paintball player will be caught dead on their team. On the verge of giving up hope, Bobby joins forces with the most unlikely of allies... the referee that caught them cheating. Now, the two improbable partners must recruit a team of paintball misfits and take back the Hudson Valley Paintball Classic taking place at Liberty Paintball in Patterson, New York.
Awards
The film won the Audience Award at the 2004 South By Southwest Film Festival and the 2005 Boston Independent Film Festival.

Maid in Manhattan is a 2002 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Wayne Wang and based on a story by John Hughes, who is credited using a pseudonym. It stars Jennifer Lopez, Ralph Fiennes, and Natasha Richardson. In the film, a hotel maid and a high-profile politician fall in love. The film was released on December 13, 2002, by Columbia Pictures and was a box office success, grossing $154 million against its $55 million budget.
Plot
Marisa Ventura, a single mother raising their 10-year-old son Ty, works as a maid at the Beresford Hotel in the heart of Manhattan. When not in school, Ty spends time with Marisa's fellow hotel workers, who think they can be promoted to management.
While Marisa and their co-worker Stephanie are cleaning the room of socialite Caroline Lane, Stephanie convinces Marisa to try on a Dolce & Gabbana coat. Lane had previously asked for it to be returned to the store, and Stephanie argues that it "technically" does not belong to anyone at the moment. Elsewhere in the hotel, Ty befriends hotel guest and senatorial candidate Christopher "Chris" Marshall, whom Ty learns has an interest in Richard Nixon, the subject of their school presentation. Ty wants to go with Chris to walk their dog and the pair go to Caroline's room to ask Marisa for permission. Chris meets Marisa, who is wearing the designer coat, and is instantly smitten with them They assume that they are Caroline. The trio spend some time together at the park. Though Marisa and Chris are attracted to each other, Marisa is terrified that management will find out about the ruse and makes it a point to avoid Chris afterwards.
Chris asks the hotel's head butler, Lionel Bloch, to invite "Caroline Lane" to lunch, but is confused when the real Caroline shows up instead of Marisa. Marisa was present when they received the invitation and even offered Caroline advice on what to wear for their "lunch à deux". When the real Caroline shows up, Chris asks their assistant Jerry Siegal to find "the other Caroline Lane", promising that they will attend an important dinner and wishes them to go with him. Jerry asks Lionel to find them Lionel, who has figured out that Marisa is the woman Chris has been looking for, tells them to go to the dinner and end the affair swiftly if they want a future in hotel management. Stephanie and the hotel staff assist them in preparing for the evening by styling their hair and loaning them an expensive dress and spectacular necklace.
Marisa is unable to end the affair, and they spend the night in Chris' hotel room. The next morning, Marisa is spotted by the real Caroline and their friend leaving Chris' room. Caroline blurts out the truth to the hotel management and Marisa is fired in front of Chris in Lane's hotel suite. Both Marisa and Chris spend time apart with them still thinking about them Marisa is also hounded by the media and their disapproving mother Veronica.
Some time later, Marisa secures another job as a maid at another hotel. Chris is giving a news conference at the same hotel. Ty attends it and asks Chris whether people should be forgiven if they make mistakes, referencing former President of the United States Richard Nixon. Ty leads them to the staff room where Marisa is having their break. Chris and Marisa are reunited, and the film ends with images of publications showing that Chris has been elected, they and Marisa are still together after a year, and Marisa and their maid friends have been promoted to management.
Cast
Production
The film was originally titled The Chambermaid and then Uptown Girl. It was described as a Cinderella-type story. John Hughes was initially announced as the film's director, with Hilary Swank set to star as the lead. Variety confirmed in July 2001 that Jennifer Lopez was in negotiations to star in The Chambermaid, with Hughes no longer directing the project. Swank was no longer involved in the film. Ralph Fiennes signed on to star in the film in February 2002. Natasha Richardson joined the cast in April 2002. The film's title was confirmed as Maid in Manhattan in August 2002. Describing the character of Marisa, Lopez said: "She's Puerto Rican. She's from the Bronx. They have this young son and she's just trying to make ends meet. Every day they get on the train to work. They go to this big city of dreams and they want more. They have aspirations in that way." Fiennes' character was originally a wealthy British guest.
Principal photography commenced in New York City in April, just months after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in which the towers of the World Trade Center (visible in some unused pre-production footage) were destroyed, and concluded by June 2002. Filming was carried out at both New York's Roosevelt Hotel and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Filming also took place in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx on E 175 Street between the Grand Concourse and on Jerome Avenue. John Hughes wrote the story, but was credited as Edmond Dantes. On the film's first day of production in The Bronx, paparazzi and spectators forced filming to stop, and police were called as a result of the pandemonium. Wayne Wang said "No one in the production was prepared for it."
Soundtrack
The film features Paul Simon's "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard" in the opening credits, "Lovergirl" sung by Teena Marie, "Train on a Track" sung by Kelly Rowland, "Come Away with Me" and "Don't Know Why" sung by Norah Jones, Michael Jackson's "Fall Again" sung by Glenn Lewis, Paul Simon's "Kathy's Song" sung by Eva Cassidy and "I'm Coming Out" sung by Amerie.
Reception
Box office
Maid in Manhattan opened at 2,838 theaters in the United States, reaching number one at the box office in its opening weekend with $18.7 million, beating out Star Trek: Nemesis, by less than $200,000. It earned a total of $94 million domestically, and $60.9 million in other countries, for a total gross of $154.8 million worldwide.
Critical response
Maid in Manhattan received mixed reviews from film critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 38% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 5.10/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Too blandly generic, Maid in Manhattan also suffers from a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Fiennes." Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.
Time magazine named it one of the top 10 worst chick flicks. According to Anna Smith of the magazine Empire: "the film constantly falls back on its staple fairy-tale plotline, which is so resolutely traditional it should succeed in charming its target audience". Nell Minow of Common Sense Media wrote positively, stating: "is as careful a combination of ingredients as it is possible to package [sic] Everything is at the fairy tale level, which means we never dwell on troubling realities". Paul Byrnes of the Sydney Morning Herald said: "The script is so lazy it snores, and Wayne Wang directs like they walked onto the wrong set - true enough, in its way." Rich Cline of the webzine Film Threat reviewed Maid in Manhattan positively. Cline wrote: "When we catch ourselves sighing at the end, we get mad that we've fallen for this same old formula all over again. But mad in a nice way." Roger Ebert wrote that the film is a "skillful, glossy, formula picture, given life by the appeal of its stars".
Charles Passy of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution gave it a negative review, writing: "Instead of a fairy tale, we have a tale told without imagination. It's Cinderella gone stale." Andrew Chase of Killer Movie Reviews, however, was more positive. Chase wrote: "Leave reality at the concession stand along with your $20 for popcorn, candy and a large drink". Derek Adams of Time Out wrote: "Talented individuals labour over the contrivances in this lightweight romance, and if the result's fluff, at least it's painless."
Lopez's casting in the film sparked some debate. Variety commented that "[m]aking the maid a Latina is certainly realistic but never quite avoids the suggestion that upward mobility is best achieved through marriage into Anglo society". Fade to Black and White: Interracial Images in Popular Culture (2009) author Erica Chito Childs noted aspects of the film to expose the objective sides of a biracial relationship using the "symbolic roles of maid and politician". Writer Betty Kaklamanidou praised Lopez's casting in the film which "proved that a Latin actor can move away from stereotypical supporting roles and effectively become the center of a romantic narrative".
Accolades
Spin-off
ABC announced in August 2008 that it would be adapting the film to a television series, with Lopez producing. Chad Hodge was hired as a scriptwriter. In 2009, Sony Pictures Television indicated the spiff-off as a put pilot.
Telenovela version
Telemundo and Sony Pictures Television were co-producing a telenovela based on the movie called Una Maid en Manhattan, starring Litzy and Eugenio Siller. As of November 29, 2011, the telenovela was airing in Telemundo weeknights at 8pm/7pm central.

On January 28, 2014, Mauch testified at a hearing at a committee meeting regarding a law that would separate the joint holiday honoring civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Mauch spoke in support of Lee, saying Lee had "committed no crimes, broke no laws, and violated no part of the Constitution...the historically uneducated continue to denigrate them with their false accusations." The law did not pass.

Gilberto "Pulpo" Colón Jr. (Born December 28, 1953) is a pianist, composer, and band leader.  They are credited for working with all three of the "Big 3" (Tito Puente, Tito Rodriguez, & Machito Orchestras).
Early musical influences
Colón's family moved to the United States from Puerto Rico in the 1940s and immediately settled in the Bronx. Colón's early musical influences ranged from The Beatles, Elvis Presley to Puerto Rican “Jibaro” music. They formally began their musical career at the age of 14. After experimenting with various instruments, Colón joined their close friend Oscar Hernández (musician) with piano lessons. Under the tutelage of piano luminary Charlie Palmieri, Colón quickly learned the essential skills needed to succeed in the competitive industry. As a teenager, Colón was beginning to play at the epicenter of Salsa's Golden Age.
Recording debut
After playing New York City's Latin circuit, Colón joined the young orchestra of Rafi Val y La Diferente. It was with La Diferente where Colón made their recording debut on the self-titled album (1971). Colón continued to perform and record on the subsequent La Diferente albums (La Sociedad '72, Fuerza Bruta '74). Following their time with La Diferente, Colón began working consistently with Louie Ramirez, Justo Betancourt, Marty Galagarza y La Conquistadora, Joe Cuba, and Andy Harlow.
Héctor Lavoe years
In the winter of 1975 Colón was approached by Héctor Lavoe to join their orchestra. Colón's first recording with Lavoe was in 1977 on the acclaimed Fania Records album Comedia (album). Colón's extended piano solo on the song 'Bandolera' earned them the award of 'Best Latin Piano Solo of the Year'. Initially awarded to former Lavoe pianist Professor Joe Torres due to an editorial mistake the award bolted Colón to the forefront of Latin Music's notable musicians. Today, this is still considered one of the most historic piano solos ever recorded on a commercial salsa album. Colon served as Lavoe's Pianist and Musical Director for 16 years performing and traveling the world with the Salsa Icon.
Along with Lavoe and the “Big 3”, Colón has performed & recorded with Latin music's most popular artists including Adalberto Santiago, Kako (musician), Pete "El Conde" Rodríguez, La Bruja, and many more.

Andrew Christopher Symeou (born 16 October 1988) is a British born memoirist and author of the book Extradited: The European Arrest Warrant and My Fight for Justice from a Greek Prison Cell.
Symeou was falsely accused of attacking and killing holidaymaker Jonathan Hiles in a Greek nightclub. The case gained public interest in 2009 when they were extradited to Greece on a European Arrest Warrant and spent a year in prison before trial. Most of their incarceration was spent in Korydallos prison; a high-security facility known for its bad conditions, inhumane treatment of inmates and gang related violence. Symeou was found not guilty of the killing on 17 June 2011. In April 2013 British Coroner Mary Hassell accused the police of using brutality in the preliminary investigation and stated that the other evidence against Symeou had been concocted by the officers. It was found that Symeou was not in the nightclub at the time of the attack.
Memoir
Symeou's book, Extradited, was published by Biteback Publishing in May 2015. The memoir was a winner of the CompletelyNovel big book launch 2015, which included authors who had written books on the theme of inspiring people and places.
Political impact
The case is notable for highlighting the problems with the European Arrest Warrant and how it operates. Ex Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg stated; "No-one should ever have to go through what Andrew and the Symeou family went through. It was a travesty that they were made to suffer so much for so long. Their case showed that there were real problems with the way the EAW was operating and that things needed to change as a result."

The United Kingdom's Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies (IHGS) was founded in 1961 at Canterbury, Kent (its current location) by Cecil Humphery-Smith. Its library was created by donations from Humphery-Smith, Aylmer Buesst and others.
The Institute promotes research, study, and training in all aspects of family history, including heraldry. Courses may be undertaken by full-time students, through a series of evening classes combined with other studies, or by a correspondence course. Those who complete approved courses may sit the diploma examination after submitting adequate evidence of practical experience. Those who hold the diploma and produce an acceptable dissertation or thesis can qualify as Licentiates of the Institute, or LHG. Students, armorists, genealogists and family historians are able to make use of the extensive collection of books and manuscripts in the Institute's library.
In January 2010, Dr Richard C. F. Baker became Principal of the Institute.
Arms
In 1982, armorial bearings were granted to the Institute. These are blazoned Azure a Cross patonce within an orle of eight Acorns cups inward Or.

Siphonophorida (Greek for "tube bearer") is an order of millipedes containing two families and over 100 species.
Description
Millipedes in the order Siphonophorida are long and worm-like, reaching up to in length and up to 190 body segments. Eyes are absent, and in many species the head is elongated into a long beak, with mandibles highly reduced. The beak may serve in a suctorial function. The body has a dense covering of fine setae. Each body segment consists of a dorsal tergite, two lateral pleurites, and ventral sternite, which are unfused. The male reproductive appendages (gonopods) are simple and leg-like, consisting of the ninth and 10th leg pairs. This lack of specialization has led to Siphonophorida being called a "taxonomist's nightmare", and Jeekel (cited in) jokingly gave the order the "taxonomists' award for least popular group among diplopods".
Distribution
Siphonophorida occurs from southwestern USA to Brazil and Peru in the western hemisphere, as well as South Africa, India, southeast Asia and Australia. The oldest fossil of the group is from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber, assignable to the extant genus Siphonophora.
Classification
Two families are traditionally recognized. Differences between the two families include antennae and head structure: the large family Siphonophoridae, with over 100 species, has elongated beak-like mouthparts, and straight antennae with sensory pits on the fifth and sixth antennal segments ("antennomeres)". The family Siphonorhinidae, with only around 10 species, lacks the beak-like mouthparts, and has geniculate (elbowed) antennae lacking sensory pits on the fifth and sixth antennomere. The siphonorhinid genus Nematozonium with two species, is sometimes placed in its own monotypic family, Nematozoniidae.

Francisco del Rosario Sánchez (March 9, 1817 – July 4, 1861) was a Dominican politician, national hero and founding father of the Dominican Republic.  They are considered by Dominicans as the second leader of the 1844 Dominican War of Independence, after Juan Pablo Duarte and before Matías Ramón Mella. The Order of Merit of Duarte, Sánchez and Mella is named in honor of these three.
Following Duarte's exile, Sánchez took leadership of the independence movement, while continuing to correspond with Duarte through their relatives. With the success of the separation from Haiti in 1844, Sánchez served as Dominican Republic first intern president before ceded their position. But with their ideas of an independent state came with many opposing sides, leading to many public disputes, exiles, and unfortunate deaths.
Life
Early years and background
Sánchez was the son of Olaya del Rosario Belén (1791–1849), a mulatto woman of light complexion and Narciso "Seño Narcisazo" Sánchez Ramona (1789–1869), a tall black man descendant of slaves. Because of their different racial and social-economical status (hers being superior to his), Narciso Sánchez and Olaya del Rosario married after a special authorisation given by the mayor.
Their surnames are inverted because their parents were not married at the time of their birth, marrying in 1819.
Sánchez had children with several women, the first being Felícita Martínez , with whom they procreated Mónica, born on January 30, 1838, when Sánchez was 20 years old. Some years later they procreated María Gregoria (Goyita), born on November 30, 1841, with María Evarista Hinojosa. Later, with Leoncia Leydes Rodríguez from Curaçao, they had Leoncia. Later with Mercedes Pembrén Chevalier they procreated Petronila.
On April 4, 1849, they married Balbina de Peña Pérez , with whom they procreated Juan Francisco and Manuel de Jesús. Their son Juan Francisco was Minister of Finance in the government of Ulises Heureaux and was part of the government cabinet of also President Carlos Morales Languasco .r they procreated María Gregoria (Goyita) with María Evarista Hinojosa. Later, with Leoncia Leydes Rodríguez from Curaçao, they had Leoncia. Later with Mercedes Pembrén Chevalier they procreated Petronila.
The eldest of 11 children, Sánchez grew up in a very nationalistic family. They first received their education from their mother, and later by the Peruvian priest Gaspar Hernández, a patriot who encouraged the young Sánchez to follow in their family's footsteps. They were also influenced by their father and aunt, Maria Trinidad Sánchez, both involved in the movement to libertate Dominicans from Haitian rule under the dictatorship of Jean-Pierre Boyer, who invaded in 1822 and brought the whole island under their control.
Sánchez traveled to the U.S. and Europe as a young man. Their vision of the cause was the typical republican goal of the Age of Enlightenment. Juan Pablo Duarte's exile took place at the last and most crucial stage of the struggle. It was when Duarte was exiled and in hiding in Venezuela that Sánchez became the central presence in the Dominican revolt.
Sánchez took the lead as the prime mover of the independence movement, maintaining contact with Duarte through their relatives. While educated and having taught themselves Latin and French later in life, they are mostly remembered as a man of action. In the proceedings that took place just before the proclamation of independence on February 27, 1844, Sánchez was elected by their peers in La Trinitaria as Commander in Arms and Chief of the Government Junta in the nascent republic. This was quite a recognition and a testament to their virtues.
Substitute leader of independence
On that night, Sánchez and their men marched to Puerta Del Conde. Matías Ramón Mella, another patrician, fired their blunderbuss into the air, while Sánchez raised the first independent Dominican flag, shouting the national slogan, "Dios, Patria, Y Libertad," (God, Homeland, and Freedom), proclaiming to the world the birth of the new independent nation: The Dominican Republic.
Their first act after declaration of independence was to take presidency of the Governing Board, but ceded their position to conservative Tomás Bobadilla after 24 hours. However, after discovering Bobadilla's attempt to annex the new nation to France, Sánchez, along with Mella, led a revolt which subsequently displaced Bobadilla, and reinstalled Sánchez as president in June of 1844. Simultaneously, Sánchez would be toppled in another coup d'etat led by the wealthy caudillo, Pedro Santana. Santana immediately declared Sánchez, Mella, and Duarte, who had just returned to country, as traitors to the homeland and were forced into exile. This action would be the start of the fall out between the independence Trinitarios and the pro-annexation sectors of the nation.
It was during their exile in Curaçao, when they had received the tragic news that their aunt, Maria Trinidad Sánchez, had been tortured and executed by Santana for refusing to name the conspirators against them on February 27, 1845, exactly one year after the independence from Haiti. Several others of Sánchez's relatives also shared them fate.
In 1848, Manuel Jimines, the newly elected president, granted an amnesty which allowed the return of Sanchez and many of the exiled patriots back to the country. Sanchez returned to the Dominican Republic during a very crucial time. On their return, Sanchez held many important positions during the governments of Jimines, Santana, and Buenaventura Báez. Serving as Public Defender, on the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, their most prolific case was that of Santana's case against war general Antonio Duvergé, in which took place during Santana's campaign in 1849. Although Duvergé would be acquitted, this did not ease the tension between them and Santana due to Santana's pro-annexation plans. Duvergé would later be executed, along with their son, on April 11, 1855. Sánchez reacted with discontent, and as a result, was forced into exile for the second time that same year. They would be allowed to return in 1856.
However, it was during this period that political and economic disorder plagued the Caribbean nation. With the Dominican War of Independence coming to a close, the country had inherited a serious amount of debt due to Santana's heavy spending of the wars, as well as the bankrupted treasury left behind during Báez's time in office. Santana's misrule of the power combined with Báez corrupt regime left a devastating effect on the nation's economy. This, along with consistent fears of another attack from the Haitians, gave justification for the nation to be annexed to a foreign power. Sánchez, as expected, strongly protested against this, and for the final time, in 1859, was exiled and banished from the country, this time to Saint Thomas.
Ultimately, in 1861, Santana struck a deal with Spain to reintegrate the Dominican Republic back to colonial status in exchange for honorary privileges. Learning of this action, Sánchez was furious and began their plan to protest against this. During this time, they attempted to gain support from various other countries but to no avail. Faced with no other choice, Sánchez ended up traveling to Haiti, where they asked president Fabre Geffrard for support to liberate the Dominican Republic from Spanish neocolonialism. Although initially skeptical, they eventually agreed to give aid to the rebels due to the possibility of Spain stretching its power to the rest of the island.
Before entering the Dominican Republic, they published their final manifesto in January of 1861. In it, they explain their intention to enter the country through Haiti, ensuring that they are doing so for the Dominican nation:
"I have entered through Haiti because I cannot do it anywhere else. But if anyone tries to sully my name for that, tell them that I am the Dominican flag."
In another letter, written to Damián Báez, Sánchez firmly asserts:
"My country is sold. This is enough."
Entering through Hondo Valle, (in the province of present day Elías Piña), Sánchez led a force in an attempt to overthrow Santana, making their way towards Santo Domingo. But just as they and their troops arrived in San Juan de la Maguana, they and their men fell into an ambush, led by Santana's forces, which resulted in Sánchez being wounded in the groin and ultimately captured. Santana, in a attempt to exploit Sánchez's rebellious actions as treacherous, decreed that they and their followers to stand trial and face sentence in July of 1861. Sánchez, sentenced to death, along with their other followers, attempted to urge their followers be spared in exchange for their life, but failed. Before their death, Sánchez shouted their final words:
"To raise the flag, you must shed the blood of Sánchez, but to lower the flag, you must also shed the blood of Sánchez."
Sánchez, two-time hero and founding father of the Dominican Republic, was shot dead on July 4, 1861, at the young age of 44.
The execution of Sánchez sent shockwaves throughout island. It sent a clear message to the patriots of the fate of anyone who dared to challenge Spanish rule. However, the struggle for independence continued to mount as many patriots would arise and join the cause, thus triggering the interlude for the Dominican Restoration War.
Following Sánchez's death, their sister, Socorro was exiled to St. Thomas for two years. When they returned to the Dominican Republic in 1863, they were imprisoned for a year for outspokenness against the regime.
Gregorio Luperón, a then 22 year old patriot from Puerto Plata, expressed their opposition of the Spanish presence in the Dominican Republic, and was arrested. However, they managed to escape from prison and sought refuge in the U.S, and later Haiti. They returned to the country though Monti Cristi, where they would begin their revolt against Spanish rule, and Pedro Santana, who at this point was now ruling the country under military dictatorship, in support of Spain.
Duarte, hearing of the country's annexation to Spain, returned to their homeland once to take part in the struggle for independence. Mella, despite their financial crumble and illness, also joined in the cause to liberate the Dominican Republic from Spain.
Eventually, these actions, as well as those of many others paid off. In 1865, Queen Isabella II, realizing that they could not fare off against the Dominicans, withdrew their support and called off their remaining troops from the country, thereby restoring the nation's independence and ending the last Spanish threat to the Dominican Republic. Sánchez never lived to see this transpire.
Legacy
Sánchez's legacy is forever engraved into the memory of the Dominican Republic. Their contributions to politics, nationalism, and ideals of an independent Dominican state marked them as a true icon for the nation. Some historians have credited them as the true father of the nation due to their status as the leader of the independence movement following Duarte's exile in Venezuela. Many Dominicans even consider them to be the strongest of the founding fathers. Brave, honest, bold, and brash, Sánchez's qualities set them apart from many patricians, making the honorable act of sacrificing their lives for the nation.
 They are entombed in a mausoleum, Altar de la Patria, at the Count's Gate (Puerta del Conde) alongside Duarte and Mella, at the location of the start of the War of Independence.
In the province of Samaná, the city of Sánchez is named in their honor.
In San Juan de la Maguana, (in the province of present day San Juan), the place where Sánchez was captured and executed, a park is named after them along with a memorial statue dedicated to their legacy.

The Peck-Porter House is a historic house at the corner of Main and Middle Streets in Walpole, New Hampshire. Built in 1839, it is an unusually elaborate and sophisticated example of Greek Revival architecture, given its small-town setting. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
Description and history
The Peck-Porter House stands just south of Walpole's small commercial district, on the west side of Main Street at its northwest corner with Middle Street. It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade is three bays wide, sheltered by a two-story portico supported by fluted Doric columns. The columns rise to an entablature and a fully pedimented gable with a rounded fan at its center. The side elevations have matching single story porches supported by fluted columns. The interior retains many original period features, including a particularly fine spiral staircase and six fireplace mantels. An ell extending to the rear of the house contains evidence of older construction, suggesting it may have been at least part of the original c. 1790s house on the property.
The main block of the house was built in 1839 for Philip Peck, owner of a local dry goods business. The house is an excellent example of high Greek Revival styling rarely found in rural parts of New Hampshire. Peck lost the house after going bankrupt in 1842; it was eventually acquired by Dr. Winslow Porter in 1875, in whose family it remained until 1963.

The Klinikum am Weissenhof is a psychiatric hospital in Weinsberg. It was opened in 1903 as a royal sanatorium on the public domain of Weißenhof.
History
Toward the end of the 19th century the four existing public sanatoria for the mentally ill in Württemberg (in Zwiefalten, Winnental, Schussenried and Weißenau) were overcrowded. Numerous invalids had to be rejected and accommodated in ordinary hospitals or sent back to their hometowns, where they could not be treated properly. There were no psychiatric institutions in the north of Württemberg, which was particularly problematic for the mentally ill and their relatives of those regions, since they had to travel large distances in order to receive treatment.
In 1897/98 the federal state Wurttemberg wanted to build a fifth state owned psychiatric institute. The search for a suitable construction site started in the north of Wurtemberg. The site would have to be located in a quiet area on one hand, but at the same time it should be near a train station and a large town. Consequently, the public domain of Weißenhof, a century old estate, was chosen. It is situated only two kilometres away from the local train station of Weinsberg and six kilometres from the city of Heilbronn. On 6 July 1899 the chamber of representatives granted three million Marks for the construction of the institution. At the beginning the institution was supposed to accommodate 500 patients, which could be increased by 50 more patients upon the completion of the construction.
In the fall of 1900 the construction of the mental hospital began with the building of a water supply system. In March 1901 a park was created on a small hill above the Sulmtal about 1 kilometer north of Weinsberg. The park was located right next to the court buildings and was set up in a pavilion system covering several individual hospital wards. In the beginning the wards were strictly separated, the western half of the park was dedicated to male patients and the eastern half to female patients. The administration buildings were put up in the center of the park. On 23 November the first patients were admitted and in 1905 the sanatorium was filled to capacity. First director of the institution was Paul Kemmler. From 1913 to 1915 an institutional church was built in the north of the area and a small cemetery was set up next to it. However, today there are no funerals being held anymore.
Within the context of Aktion T4 in Nazi Germany, patients of the Weinsberg institute were transported to the Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre where they were executed. Later on it was used as a Zwischenanstalt, a kind of temporary encampment, for the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. The patients were placed there temporarily, awaiting their transport to Hadamar and their impending execution. From January 1940 until the end of 1941 a total of 908 patients were transported from Weisenberg to euthanasia centers. 426 people were patients directly from Weisenberg and 482 were patients from other hospitals. Furthermore, between the years of 1934 and 1945 96 male and 107 female patients have been forcefully sterilized as part of the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring.
The unoccupied rooms were used as a tuberculosis sanatorium between 1943 and 1946. During the Second World War parts of the hospital of Heilbronn were relocated to Weisenberg from 1941 until 1952. This was due to the imminent threat and following destruction of the hospital by airstrikes in 1944.
Karl Eugen Jooss, deputy chairperson since 1936 and acting chairperson of the institution since 1940, tried to fight the establishment of an assembly point for euthanasia transports. One of the reasons for their refusal were the rising numbers of deaths, which made the purpose of the transports clear.
However, officer Otto Mauthe, who worked for the internal affairs office of Württemberg and was responsible for the Aktion T4, threatened to close the institution if Jooss were not willing to comply. Consequently, Jooss only succeeded partially, since the institution still served as an assembly point but its employees did not actively participate in the execution of the transports.
At a later point, Mauthe tried to justify themselves by saying that they had been forced to act. They also claimed that originally the institution had been designated to serve as a Napo-School.
Despite the risk of being killed for a breach of secrecy, Jooss told their closest colleagues about the true purpose of the transports. By declaring patients able to work or letting their relatives pick them up from the institution, numerous lives were saved. In September 1945, director Jooss committed suicide as it became public knowledge that the US-American occupation forces wanted to unseat him.
At the beginning of the 60s a new hospital ward was built in the west of the compound, which was mainly demolished in 2000/01 and replaced by a new building.
The building of a new structure for the forensic psychiachtry department led to some public turmoil in 2003. The new building was constructed to house 50 patients with mental disorders against which a local initiative collected signatures and addressed a petition to the Landtag (the legislative assembly) of Baden-Württemberg. Nevertheless, constructions went on and complying to all requirements the building was officially inaugurated on 18 May 2006. In 2007 however, the city approved of some temporary adjustments to the concept. These changes would allow that 25 patients with mental illness and 25 patients with drug-addiction would be accommodated in the new building. Another 25 patients would be situated in other buildings of the clinic, which makes a total of 100 patients living in forensic commitment at the Klinikum am Weißenhof.
In June 2007 the clinic opened up two new day-units in the nearby city of Heilbronn. One of these new day-hospitals had already been established on the clinic's compound in January 2006 and moved from there to Heilbronn, this unit provides general psychiatric treatments and psychotherapy. The other, newly established unit, provides treatment for geropsychiatric patients. Both units are located in the former Privatklinik Dr. Reinhard, a private hospital which was bought by the Klinikum am Weisenhof in March 2006. The clinic invested 3 million Euros in this project.
On the first of January 2010 the neurology department of the clinic, with its 70 beds and 90 employees, was passed over to the SLK-Kliniken, the hospital of the city of Heilbronn. At the beginning of 2011, the department was moved into a newly constructed building of the Gesundbrunnen-Klinikum in Heilbronn.
The clinic today
As a federal state operated hospital the psychiatry was called Psychiatrisches Landeskrankenhaus Weinsberg since 1954. Due to a legal reform in 1996 the hospital became a public agency and changed its name to Zentrum für Psychiatrie Weinsberg (psychiatric centre Weinsberg). In 2002 the name was changed again, it is now called Klinikum am Weissenhof (Clinic at the Weissenhof), science the hospital no longer cared for psychiatric patients only. The hospital is a legally independent member of the group ZfP-Gruppe Baden-Württemberg.
Today Klinikum am Weissenhof is a state-of-the-art psychiatric hospital. Its numerous departments are general psychiatry, gerontological psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, pediatry and adolescent psychiatry, as well as addiction therapy and psychotherapeutic medicine. In 522 regular beds 13.000 patients are treated annually. The hospital has approximately 1.100 employees, which makes it the largest employer in the area of Weinsberg. Altogether the 97 hospital buildings are distributed across the area of the 43 ha park. The park has 3.800 trees and the buildings are connected through 10 km of pathways.
The hospital is a teaching hospital for the University of Heidelberg. Additionally patients of high school age have the opportunity to attend a school especially for long term patients. It runs a nursing school in cooperation with the clinic Löwenstein. The school trains nurses and health care professionals. Furthermore, the psychiatric center houses a pharmacy, a garden center which is used for therapy as well, and has an own fire department.

The official 2014/2015 snooker world ranking points for the professional snooker players on the World Snooker Main Tour in the 2014–15 season are based on performances in ranking and minor-ranking tournaments over a two-year rolling period. Following an overhaul of the world rankings it is the first season where the tariffs are based on prize money. Rather than being awarded points according to tariffs preset by the governing body as in previous seasons, the players are now ranked by their prize money earnings in tournaments that carry ranking status. The only exception to this is when a player loses their first match: for the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons only half the money earned for the event counts towards the player's ranking, and for the 2014/2015 season a player will not receive any points at all for that tournament. Due to the transition to the new ranking system, the start ranks of the 2014/2015 season for the top 64 players are incongruent with the ranks of the players at the end of the previous season.
The rankings at the start of 2014/2015 season are determined by prize money earned in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons and updated after every tournament carrying ranking status. As points are earned from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons previous are dropped. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at six further stages. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2014/2015 season, all of the points from the 2013/2014 season, and the points from the 2012/2013 season that have not yet been dropped. The total points from the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons set the rankings at the start of the 2015/2016 season.

The Hi-Lo's were a vocal quartet formed in 1953, who achieved their greatest fame in the late 1950s and 1960s. The group's name is a reference to their extreme vocal and physical ranges (Bob Strasen and Bob Morse were tall, Gene Puerling and Clark Burroughs were short).
History
The group consisted of Gene Puerling (bass-baritone or fourth voice, arranger, leader, and occasional soloist), Bob Strasen (baritone or third voice), Bob Morse (baritone or second voice and frequent soloist) and Clark Burroughs (tenor or first voice/lead). In 1959, Bob Strasen left the group after they began losing their voice to unknown causes. After Strasen's departure, Bob Morse switched to the Baritone or third part, and tenor Don Shelton sang the second part.
They were occasionally supported by Frank Sinatra. Clare Fischer was their pianist for years and occasionally wrote arrangements for the group.
The Hi-Lo's recorded the theme song to the 1956 television series Noah's Ark. They were also featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture Everything's Ducky (1961), contributing three songs: "Everything's Ducky," "Moonlight Music" and "The Scuttlebutt Walk." They also made numerous appearances on television and had many live performances. The first group that had the Hi-Lo's name was a Barbershop quartet out of Wisconsin. None of those original members were in Gene Puerling's group which started some years later, The Singers Unlimited.
Individual group members
In 1966, Puerling and Shelton along with Bonnie Herman and Len Dressler, formed another vocal group, The Singers Unlimited. This group gave a wide range for Puerling's arrangements, for the four singers multi-tracked as many as 16 voices. For that reason The Singers Unlimited were exclusively a recording group.
Bob Strasen died February 28, 1994, and Bob Morse on April 27, 2001. Afterward, Puerling, Shelton and Burroughs still appeared very occasionally as the Hi-Lo's in and around Southern California. Shelton is an accomplished reed player and has played in Clare Fischer's bands. Clark Burroughs is semi-retired and can sometimes be heard on film soundtracks.
On March 25, 2008, Gene Puerling died just before their 79th birthday.
Legacy
The Hi-Lo's and especially their innovative use of vocal harmony, were an influence on the groups and musicians Take 6, The King's Singers, The Manhattan Transfer, Chanticleer, The Free Design, Herbie Hancock, The Association, and Brian Wilson.

At the time of the song's release, this was frontman, Masato Hayakawa's favourite song from the record and the band, in which they state that they didn't think the song wouldn't have translated into a live setting as well as it did.
Background
"The War Is On" was released on 25 July 2013 as the band's second single and the opening track off their sixth studio album The Revelation, following the release of the first and lead single "The Revelation" which was released three months prior in April of the same year. It was the first single to be released after the album's Japanese release.
Promotion and release
Upon signing an international deal for the first time with Hopeless Records, becoming the first Japanese band to sign with the North American independent label in the process. The band would go on to announce the re-release of their 2013 album The Revelation. Alongside the announcement, they would re-release the single for "The War Is On" on 13 May 2014. The single would end up getting substantial airplay on BBC Radio 1 and Kerrang! in the UK.
Composition
"The War Is On" has been described as a post-hardcore, metalcore, alternative metal, alternative rock and a hard rock song. The track runs at 160 BPM and is in the key of D minor. It runs for three minutes and 33 seconds. The song was written by Masato Hayakawa and Ryo Yokochi, it was produced by David Bendeth who also handled the production for the rest of the album.
Track listing
Music video
The music video for "The War Is On" was released alongside the single on 25 July 2013 on the Gilsoundworks YouTube channel. Among the re-release, the music video would also be published to the Hopeless Records YouTube channel on 13 May 2014. The video was directed by Inni Vision.
The video starts with frontman, Masato Hayakawa, who takes off a creepy looking mask to start the song with the band. The video is set in a large office building in Tokyo where all the workers wear a creepy mask, which are akin to that of which is worn by Michael Myers in the Halloween films. As the song progresses, the band members are individually surrounded by a whole room worth of workers wearing these masks around a circular table which surrounds the band members one by one, as if they are about to be interrogated. As the song culminates, the band defies the group of cult-like workers by jamming the rest of the song in the room as it turns to darkness.
As of January 2022, the song between the two videos has a total of 2.1 million views on YouTube.

Bidstrup ( Buzz Throckman until 1978) joined Adelaide-band the Angels in August 1976 after the release of their first single "Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again". They were recorded on four studio albums with the band, The Angels (1977), Face to Face (1978), No Exit (1979) and Dark Room (1980). Three of these albums were certified platinum, with two reaching the top ten Kent Music Report albums chart. In 1980, Bidstrup co-wrote and co-produced the Angels' top ten single, "No Secrets" with their singer Bernard "Doc" Neeson. Bidstrup left the Angels in 1981 to focus on screen music production. They worked on Heatwave (1982), Starstruck (1982) and Greetings from Wollongong (1983). The related soundtracks had performances by Australian bands, the Riptides, the Honeymoon, and the Numbers.
Gang Gajang
Bidstrup was a founding member of Gang Gajang in Sydney in 1984. During 1983 Bailey (bandmate from the Angels), Mark Callaghan from the Riptides, (a band Bidstrup had previously produced) and Kayellen Bee wrote songs and performed on the soundtrack to the ABC TV series, Sweet and Sour (1984). Bidstrup was also Associate Music Director for the series. With the addition of Geoffrey Stapleton on keyboards and Robert James on lead guitar in 1985, Gang Gajang released four albums. Their self titled album includes the track, "Sounds of Then (This is Australia)". Bidstrup was the music director for the Quiksilver cult surf film, Mad Wax, which showcased Gang Gajang's music. They were consequently voted No. 1 band in the world by the World Professional Surfers' Association for 1988/1989. The group were intermittently active for both live performances and recording; they celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2015.
The Party Boys
Bidstrup was a founding member of The Party Boys, an all-star covers band in 1982 featuring Kevin Borich, Paul Christie, Harvey James and James Reyne. Their first live album, Live at Several 21st's, achieved gold sales, and their second album, The Greatest Hits of Other People, featured singer Richard Clapton and Robin Riley in place of Harvey and Reyne. The last recording Bidstrup made with the Party Boys was in 1983 on "No Song Too Sacred", which featured Shirley Strachan on lead vocals.
Other live work
They recorded a soundtrack for the film Starstuck with The Swingers, co-wrote and produced two albums for country band The Stetsons, recorded a live album as drummer for Riptides and has played live with many artists including Catfish, The Suave Fucks, Richard Clapton, Dave Steel Band and Jimmy Barnes Band, Australian Crawl and Mondo Rock.
Studio work
Bidstrup learned their early engineering and production skills under the mentorship of Harry Vanda and George Young at Alberts Records, and then with young engineer Mark Opitz, who co-produced two Angels albums Face to Face and No Exit. To date they have produced or co-produced over 50 albums by artists such as Riptides, The Party Boys, Gang Gajang, The Stetsons, Dave Steel, James Blundell, The Sunnyboys, Nathan Cavaleri, Diana Ah Naid and Jimmy Little and Leah Purcell. They have played as a session musician on albums by artists such as Swanee, Mondo Rock, Richard Clapton, Broderick Smith, Australian Crawl, Dave Steel, James Blundell, Nathan Cavaleri, Aly Cook, Johanna Campbell and Jimmy Barnes
Awards
Tamworth Songwriters Awards
The Tamworth Songwriters Association (TSA) is an annual songwriting contest for original country songs, awarded in January at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. They commenced in 1986. Bidstrup has won one award.

Manuel Chang (张 孟 惠) (born 22 August 1955 in Gaza Province) is a former Mozambican economist and politician of the FRELIMO party. From 2005 to 2015 they served as the Minister of Economy and Finance in President Armando Guebuza's cabinet. They replaced Luísa Diogo as Finance Minister in February 2005. Their work as Finance Minister was intertwined in a debt scandal. In January 2015 when President Filipe Nyusi assumed office they replaced Chang as Finance Minister with Adriano Maleiane.
Debt scandal
Three state-owned Mozambiqiue companies were created to exploit the county's marine resources; Proindicus was to perform coastal surveillance, Ematun was to engage in tuna fishing and MAM was to build and maintain shipyards. Debt problems began in 2013, when the Abu Dhabi-based shipbuilding and offshore construction company, Privinvest, obtained a $366 million contract with Proindicus, financed by IMF loans. The loans for this and other marine projects were requested by State Information and Security Service (SISE). As Finance Minister Chang confirmed to Swiss bankers that proceeds from a state loan should be paid to a commercial broker instead of to the Mozambique Central Bank. Chang guaranteed loans, that were illegal under Mozambique law, and kept these loans secret even from other cabinet members. In 2016 a default on Eurobonds issued by the Mozambican government to hide these and other unpaid loans first brought these actions to public attention.
Chang was arrested in December 2018 in South Africa for their part in diverting loan funds, based upon an indictment in the United States. Their extradition to the U.S. was delayed when the government of Mozambique also filed a competing request for extradition. However, in February 2020 Mozambique withdrew its request.

Prince George's Stadium is a multipurpose sports venue located in unincorporated Prince George's County, Maryland, near Bowie, primarily used for baseball. It is home of the Baltimore Orioles' Double-A affiliated Bowie Baysox in the Eastern League. The stadium is the result of a cooperative venture between Maryland Baseball Limited Partnership and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and is built on park property.
History
The stadium opened June 16, 1994. Its capacity for baseball is listed at 10,000, but when the Double-A All-Star Game was held there in 2000, the attendance was about 14,000. The 2002 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game was held at the stadium.
While the stadium was being finished, the Baysox played one full season (1993) at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium and a few series in 1994 at fields belonging to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, and the University of Maryland, College Park, as well as the minor league stadiums of the Frederick Keys and Wilmington Blue Rocks.
Tenants and events
Prince George's Stadium is located near the intersection of U.S. Route 301 and U.S. Route 50. It has been hosted to the AA All-Star Game twice, the United States Congressional Baseball Game, the annual Allen Iverson charity softball game, a lacrosse tournament, the USA Softball team, yard sales, movie nights, concerts, and Halloween activities in addition to its primary function as a baseball park. In addition, the Baysox operate a drive-in theater in the stadium's left-field parking lot during the Baysox' road trips.
Due to its close proximity to several local military bases including Fort George G. Meade and Andrews Air Force Base, the stadium is also regularly the site of related promotions involving enlisted persons. For example, on June 14, 2007, 5,000 Baysox tickets were distributed to soldiers to celebrate Flag Day with professional wrestler Sergeant Slaughter.
In 1998, the stadium hosted the Bowie Nationals, a team in the single-season Maryland Fall Baseball league.
On July 12, 2000, the ballpark hosted the Double-A All-Star Game in which a team of American League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars, 5–2, before 14,077 people in attendance.
In 2004, it served as the home of the D.C. Forward, the Pro Cricket team for Washington, D.C.
The ballpark was used for the 2020 Major League Baseball season as the alternate training site for members of the Baltimore Orioles 60-man player pool who were not assigned to the major league roster.
Appearances
Prince George's Stadium was featured in the January 30, 2007 episode ("Well Digger") of the Discovery Channel series Dirty Jobs, where host Mike Rowe performed a variety of jobs.

Steven Chapman (born 2 October 1971) was an English cricketer. They were a right-handed batsman and a slow-left arm bowler who played for Durham. They were born in Crook, beginning their cricket career as a junior with their hometown club, Crook Town CC.
Chapman appeared in their debut first-class match during the 1998 season, in which they bowled conservatively in spite of their team's poor form, which saw them lose the match by an innings margin. Chapman made two further first-class appearances the following season, though they were released at the end of 1999 after making their final Second XI appearance against Worcestershire Second XI, in which team-mate Quentin Hughes scored a double-century and Chapman themselves took match bowling figures of 12 for 48, a County Second XI record.
Having made their first appearance for Northumberland back in 1997, Chapman rejoined the team in 2001 following the end of their first-class career, and played in the Minor Counties Championship and Minor Counties Trophy until 2003.
From 2000-2009 they appeared as a club professional at a number of clubs in the North East of England and spending each winter coaching and playing in Melbourne in Australia. Since 2010 they have played back at their hometown club Crook Town.

In control theory, Ackermann's formula is a control system design method for solving the pole allocation problem for invariant-time systems by Jürgen Ackermann. One of the primary problems in control system design is the creation of controllers that will change the dynamics of a system by changing the eigenvalues of the matrix representing the dynamics of the closed-loop system. This is equivalent to changing the poles of the associated transfer function in the case that there is no cancellation of poles and zeros.
State feedback control
Consider a linear continuous-time invariant system with a state-space representation
where x is the state vector, u is the input vector, and A, B and C are matrices of compatible dimensions that represent the dynamics of the system. An input-output description of this system is given by the transfer function
Since the denominator of the right equation is given by the characteristic polynomial of A, the poles of G are eigenvalues of A (note that the converse is not necessarily true, since there may be cancellations between terms of the numerator and the denominator). If the system is unstable, or has a slow response or any other characteristic that does not specify the design criteria, it could be advantageous to make changes to it. The matrices A, B and C, however, may represent physical parameters of a system that cannot be altered. Thus, one approach to this problem might be to create a feedback loop with a gain K that will feed the state variable x into the input u.
If the system is controllable, there is always an input such that any state can be transferred to any other state . With that in mind, a feedback loop can be added to the system with the control input , such that the new dynamics of the system will be
In this new realization, the poles will be dependent on the characteristic polynomial of , that is
Ackermann's formula
Computing the characteristic polynomial and choosing a suitable feedback matrix can be a challenging task, especially in larger systems. One way to make computations easier is through Ackermann's formula. For simplicity's sake, consider a single input vector with no reference parameter , such as
where is a feedback vector of compatible dimensions. Ackermann's formula states that the design process can be simplified by only computing the following equation:
in which is the desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at matrix , and is the controllability matrix of the system.
Proof
This proof is based on Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems entry on Pole Placement Control. Assume that the system is controllable. The characteristic polynomial of is given by
Calculating the powers of results in
Replacing the previous equations into yieldsRewriting the above equation as a matrix product and omitting terms that does not appear isolated yields
From the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, , thus
Note that is the controllability matrix of the system. Since the system is controllable, is invertible. Thus,
To find , both sides can be multiplied by the vector giving
Thus,
Example
Consider
We know from the characteristic polynomial of that the system is unstable since , the matrix will only have positive eigenvalues. Thus, to stabilize the system we shall put a feedback gain
From Ackermann's formula, we can find a matrix that will change the system so that its characteristic equation will be equal to a desired polynomial. Suppose we want .
Thus, and computing the controllability matrix yields
and
Also, we have that
Finally, from Ackermann's formula
State observer design
Ackermann's formula can also be used for the design of state observers. Consider the linear discrete-time observed system
with observer gain L. Then Ackermann's formula for the design of state observers is noted as
with observability matrix . Here it is important to note, that the observability matrix and the system matrix are transposed: and .
Ackermann's formula can also be applied on continuous-time observed systems.

The Bechuanaland Union African Soccer League is a former professional football league which from 1949 to 1977 served as the top tier division in the Botswana football league system. The league was created as a merger of the Southern Protectorate League, Northern Protectorate League, Mafikeng Football Association and Western Transvaal League, which had been contested since the 1930s. It was abolished following the creation of a nationwide league, later called the Botswana Premier League, in 1978.
Format
The Bechuanaland Union African Soccer League was split into north and southern mini-leagues based on geographical location. Teams played each other twice in a double round-robin format. At the end of the campaign, which began in February and ended in November, the teams with the most points were crowned champion of their respective leagues and faced off in a one-legged playoff to determine the national champions, much like most South American leagues.

The pound (Afrikaans: pond; symbol £, £SA for distinction) was the currency of the Union of South Africa from the formation of the country as a British Dominion in 1910. It was replaced by the rand in 1961 when South Africa decimalised.
In 1825, an imperial order-in-council made sterling coinage legal tender in all the British colonies. At that time, the only British colony in Southern Africa was the Cape of Good Hope Colony. As time went on, sterling and its associated coinage became the currency of every British territory in Southern Africa. At that time sterling followed the Carolingian monetary system of a pound divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence.
History
The pound sterling became the standard currency of the Cape of Good Hope colony in 1825 following an imperial order-in-council that was issued for the purpose of introducing sterling coinage into all British colonies. British coins then replaced the Dutch currency. Before a unified South Africa, many authorities issued coins and banknotes in values equivalent to sterling.
The Transvaal Republic, the Boer state that in 1902 was to become Transvaal Colony, issued notes from 1867 to 1902 and coins from 1892 to 1902. The denominations of the gold coins were inscribed in Afrikaans, thus reading "pond" instead of "pound".
In 1920, the Treasury issued gold certificate notes. The following year, the South African Reserve Bank was established as the sole note issuing authority. Coins were issued from 1923. The South African pound remained equal to sterling throughout its existence, except for a short period following the abandonment of the gold standard in the United Kingdom in 1931. When the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, Canada quickly followed suit because it had been under exactly the same pressure as the United Kingdom. The contraction of the money supply in the United States had been causing large amounts of gold bullion to flow west across the Atlantic Ocean, and south into the United States. The situation in South Africa was different, because gold exportation to London was a major business. According to Jan Smuts in their biography, the Nationalists specifically wanted to make a point of not automatically following suit with the United Kingdom, and they perceived that they were in a strong position to do so. For the United Kingdom and Canada, an outflow of gold was seen as a flight of gold, whereas for South Africa the same was seen as a profitable enterprise. The effect of South Africa's continuing adherence to the gold standard did not however turn out as Hertzog might have hoped. The South African pound rose dramatically in value against sterling, and this virtually crippled South Africa's gold export industry overnight. By 1933, Hertzog abandoned the gold standard and the South African pound returned to parity with sterling. The relief was felt almost immediately
The South African pound was replaced during decimalisation by the rand on 14 February 1961 at a rate of R 2 = £SA 1. The rand retained a 2:1 parity with sterling until sterling's devaluation in 1967 when South Africa did not follow suit.
Coins
State-issued coinage
Transvaal Republic
In 1892, the Transvaal Republic introduced coins in denominations of 1d, 3d, 6d, 1/–, 2/–, 2/6, 5/–, £ (10/–) and £1. The last of these coins were issued in 1900, except for siege £1 coins issued in 1902.
Union of South Africa
The Union of South Africa issued coins from 1923, in denominations of d, d, 1d, 3d and 6d, 1/–, 2/– (initially denominated as a florin), 2/6, £ and £1. (The £ and £1 were gold coins known as the half sovereign and sovereign respectively.) The coins were the same weights as the corresponding sterling coins but the silver coins (3d up to 2/6) were struck in .800 fineness silver. Gold coins were struck until 1932.
In 1947, 5/– coins were introduced, with occasional commemorative variants. In 1951, the silver coinage switched to .500 fineness. Gold bullion £ and £1 coins were issued from 1952 in the same specifications as the and 1 sovereign.
All the coins had the monarch on the obverse, with the titles in Latin, while the reverse had the denomination and "South Africa" written in English and Afrikaans.
Banknotes
The government of the Cape Colony issued a £1 note in 1835 and a £20 note in 1834. Between 1869 and 1872, the ZAR in Transvaal issued notes for 6d, 1/–, 2/6, 5/–, 10/–, £1, £5 and £10. The National Bank of the ZAR issued £1 notes between 1892 and 1893. During the Second Boer War, government notes were issued in denominations of £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100.
In 1920, Treasury gold certificate notes were issued in denominations of £1, £5, £100, £1,000 and £10,000, in Afrikaans and English script. From 1921, the South African Reserve Bank took over the issuance of paper money, introducing notes for 10/–, £1, £5, £20 and £100. £20 notes were last issued in 1933, with £10 notes added in 1943.
All banknotes were bilingual in English and Afrikaans. From 1948, two variants of each note were issued, one with English written first and the other with Afrikaans written first.

Stranger-originated life insurance ("STOLI") generally means any act, practice, or arrangement, at or prior to policy issuance, to initiate or facilitate the issuance of a life insurance policy for the intended benefit of a person who, at the time of policy origination, does not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured under the laws of the applicable state. This includes the purchase of life insurance with resources or guarantees from or through a person that, at the time of policy initiation, could not lawfully initiate the policy; an arrangement or other agreement to transfer ownership of the policy or the policy benefits to another person; or a trust or similar arrangement that is used directly or indirectly for the purpose of purchasing one or more policies for the intended benefit of another person in a manner that violates the insurable interest laws of the state. The main characteristic of a STOLI transaction is that the insurance is purchased solely as an investment vehicle, rather than for the benefit of the policy owner's beneficiaries. STOLI arrangements are typically promoted to consumers between the age of 65 and 85.
A STOLI transaction may require the cooperation of the insured, by, for example, allowing access to the insured's medical records. The policy owner also may be paid a fee for taking out the policy.
Descriptions of STOLI arrangements may vary. They may be called "zero premium life insurance", "estate maximization plans", "no cost to the insured plans", "new issue life settlements", "high-net-worth settlements", "non recourse premium finance transactions" or "death bets". A similar arrangement is known as spin-life.
Legality
United States
In the United States, life insurance is regulated by the states. In general, state laws require an owner of a policy to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. A STOLI arrangement effectively circumvents the insurable interest requirement, thereby making STOLI arrangements illegal, as of July 1, 2010. They also may be considered insurance fraud, which carries both civil and criminal penalties for the parties involved.
For example, in 2011, the former New York State Insurance Department (now the New York State Department of Financial Services), U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Internal Revenue Service conducted an investigation that led to the arrest of eight persons, most of whom were licensed insurance agents who were recruiting elderly clients in a scam that involved STOLI. These insurance agents submitted life insurance applications on the lives of the elderly persons, and the applications contained inflated net worth information. Insurers then issued insurance policies worth millions of dollars. The elderly persons then sold or attempted to sell the policies after the two-year contestability period had expired. The insurance premiums were either paid by the insurance agents with the commissions they earned on the policies or by third party investors. Some of the insureds were paid monthly for their cooperation, while others were promised part of the profit when their policies were sold. The former wife of one of the insurance agents was charged with extortion for threatening to go to the police unless they were paid to keep quiet. They were paid $10,000.
Canada
The trafficking of life insurance products is illegal in many Canadian provinces (the anti-trafficking provision was never enacted in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, while Quebec repealed it in 1974).
At least one large Canadian insurer warns agents not to sell policies if the intent of the policyholder is to sell or immediately assign the policy to an unrelated third party with a non-insurable interest (other than a bank, used as collateral for a loan).
United Kingdom
The Life Assurance Act 1774 made such practices illegal. At the time, they were used for gambling.
The Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom has warned its regulated firms against selling or marketing traded U.S. life insurance policies investments (TPLIs) as they are
"high risk, toxic products", calling them highly problematic and advised UK investment firms to steer clear of them.

Andrés Guaçurary or Andrés Guazurarí, popularly known as Andresito (30 November 1778 - 1825) was a caudillo of the province of Misiones, present-day Argentina, being governor of said province between 1811 and 1822. They were one of the first federal caudillos of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and the only one of fully indigenous origin.
They were born in the misión of Santo Tomé, Corrientes or São Borja to a Guarani family. They were taken as a foster child by José Gervasio Artigas who allowed them to sign as Andrés Artigas, to avoid being excluded by their Guarani origins.
They served in the Army of the North of Manuel Belgrano, and in the Artiguista Army during the Portuguese conquest of the Banda Oriental, as General Commander. They died in Rio de Janeiro in 1825.
Having achieved the rank of colonel during their service in the armed forces of the United Provinces, in April 2014 they were posthumously promoted to General of the Argentine Army by presidential decree.

The 1989 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament was the 30th organized men's college soccer tournament by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, to determine the top college soccer team in the United States. The final match was played on December 3, 1989, in Piscataway, New Jersey, at Rutgers Stadium. All the other games were played at the home field of the higher seeded team.
The Virginia Cavaliers and the Santa Clara Broncos were declared co-national champions after the championship game ended in a 1–1 tie.
Both teams won their first national titles. This tournament marks the third and final time the NCAA recognized men's soccer co-champions; the 1967 final was called due to weather, while the 1968 final was also a draw by rule.
Early rounds
Final
The final was played in frigid conditions; the wind chill was ten degrees below zero at kickoff and dropped throughout the game, with the stiff breeze taking control of almost any ball kicked in the air. After the marathon 1985 final, which was played with unlimited 10-minute overtimes and required eight of them, the NCAA changed their rules to limit games to one 30-minute overtime and one 30-minute sudden-death period, each with two halves. Although all other tournament games could be decided by penalty kicks, this did not extend to the final. After the 150 minutes were played out, Virginia and Santa Clara were declared co-champions.

Ian Pattison (born 5 May 1982) is an English cricketer. They were a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Durham.
Pattison made four Youth Test appearances for England Under-19s, at the 2000 Under-19 World Cup, while still seventeen years of age. Following this, in 2000 and 2001 they played in Under-19 tours involving Sri Lanka and India.
Pattison played their debut County Championship match during the 2002 season, an appearance which included a painfully slow innings of 6 runs, and a second-ball duck which did little for their confidence, and they only played two further games in the season. Worse was to come as they played only once in the following 18 months, following Durham's bottom placing in the 2002 County Championship Second Division, despite 2003 being a slightly better year for the team. The following year, they played three early matches in the season, but was released at the end of the campaign, as Durham once again finished rooted to the bottom of the league.
Pattison played their final match for Durham's Second XI in August 2004, and merely a week later they joined North East Premier League team Gateshead Fell, alongside team-mates including former county cricketer Nick Phillips. They have played for the last four seasons in the MCCA Trophy competition. Pattison still plays cricket as of 2007 - their latest appearances, for their new team Northumberland, who they joined at the beginning of 2006, come more than seven years after first making their name at the Youth World Cup.  They are currently playing for Seaham Harbour in the NEPL second division as captain after joining at the start of the 2014 season.
Early life
Pattison was born in Ryhope, Sunderland and went on to attend Seaham Comprehensive School (now Seaham High School).

Zola Turn was a power pop/alternative rock band from Burlington, Vermont. They were one of the most well known bands to come out of the Burlington area besides the jam-rock band Phish. The band became a hit with its 1999 single "Tastes Like Nothing" off their album Ninja Jane (originally featured on an earlier 7" record) which landed them MTV tours, national exposure and eventually a record deal.
Zola Turn formed in late 1995 when guitarist Alice Austin and their sister Julia Austin joined up with vocalist/guitarist Jenn Karson and drummer Ann Mindell. In 1995 the band recorded "Side Saddle," and got immediate local radio play. In 1996 Ann left to pursue a master's degree in social work and drummer Rachel Bischoff joined. After two more recording projects including Cousin Battie and a self-titled 7" record, lead singer Jenn Karson left the band to work with music and sound in other artistic formats. Alice and Jenn had shared songwriting and lead singing roles up to this point, but Karson sang and wrote a majority of the songs.
The band moved on as a trio with Alice now writing all songs and taking over all lead vocals.
In January 2000, Zola Turn was signed by Randy Gerston, the music-film mogul who had just completed work on the 'Titanic (1997 film)' for Gold Circle Films. They were signed to Gold Circle Enternament, Inc., the parent company of Gold Circle Films, a Los Angeles-based company that was formed in 1996 by Norm Waitt.
Ninja Jane was to be re-mixed and touched up by producer Andy Wallace and then distributed by Sony-BMG's RED Distribution.
During this time, drummer Rachel Bischoff parted ways with the band and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Jeff Moxley, formally of the Boston band Ms. Pigeon.
In the summer of 2001 to record an album with Flaming Lips producer Keith Cleversley in Chicago. Unsatisfied with final result, the album was printed and then shelved while the band searched for a new direction.
Zola Turn officially disbanded in 2002.
In 2005, the three remaining members formed The Lavas, a new band with a heavier sound than Zola Turn. Their 2007 album Wall to Wall, was recorded entirely on their own at their studio the Bottling Company.

The President's Cup Regatta is an annual yacht race in the Philippines that attracts competitors from all over the world. It is one of the highly anticipated sports tourism events in the Philippines.
History
In 1993 a local sailing event was organized called The Easter Regatta which drew five local participants sailing from Subic Bay to Caylabne Bay in the mouth of Manila Bay. Merkano, an S&S36 skippered by Azelio Beano, won the Racing class, while Airtight Garage, a Humprhies half tonner skippered by Alan Burrel, won the Cruising class. The pioneer organizers of the event were MYC Commodore Ray Ordoveza, MYC Race Committee Chairman George Hackett, Jerry Rollin, and Allen Lundy.
The next year in the organizers of the Easter Regatta suggested to the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, organizers of the China Sea Race (a biannual race from Hong Kong to Manila Bay), to integrate the Easter regatta in their race schedule. A course was made to race from off Manila Yacht Club, to Corregidor island, and then a next leg from Corregidor to Subic Bay. That sparked the interest of international participants.
In 1995 though a China Sea Race "off year", attracted more international participants as the RHKYC organizes the Hong Kong to San Fernando race. Participants of this race readily sailed down the coast to Subic Bay to participate in the Easter Regatta held in Subic Bay. Big names included Neil Pryde, Olympic yachtsman Grey Gibson, and Andy Lam and Joy Ride a J35 which won the previous year's China Sea Race series.
In 1996 RHKYC and MYC decided to organize the finish of the China Sea Race at Subic Bay, this meant that there were more boats interested in joining the Easter Regatta as well. Beau Geste, an ILC skippered by Karl Kwok, as well as local boats Vida of Ray Ordoveza and helmed by Olympic medalist Steve Benjamin, Body Shots, helmed by J24 world champion David Bedford, Suicide Blond a Mumm 36 and another Mumm 36 Intabinda chartered by Neil Pryde after their boat Boogie Flash suffered damage six hours after the start of China Sea Race, they returned to Hong Kong and flew to Manila and then to Subic to join the racing.
The President's Cup
Then Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos, impressed by the success of Ray Ordoveza's "Vida" in the China Sea Race and Easter Regatta, encouraged the Manila Yacht Club to organize an International regatta at Subic in 1997. Thus the Easter Regatta was renamed "The President's Cup Regatta". A perpetual trophy was specially designed for the President's Cup. The first President's Cup Regatta also drew participation from one-design sportsboats, to dinghies to beach catamarans. All in all 81 boats participated in the event with participants and crew from all over the world including North America, Europe, New Zealand and of course Hong Kong. Local participants included "Vida", "Triple V Centennial" a Bashford 36 skippered by Thomas Hovenshiold. Triple V Centennial became the first yacht name to be engraved on the base of the perpetual trophy of the President's Cup Regatta.
In 1998 the China Sea Race organizers decided that the President's Cup Regatta should be the inshore series part of the China Sea Race thus scores in the President's Cup counted towards the China Sea Race series. This assured international participation in the President's Cup from then on. That year saw new boats being raced to contest the coveted perpetual trophy. No less than 3 new Sydney 46s owned by Neil Pryde, Klaus Lienau and the Subic Centential Syndicate.
"Karakoa", Ray Ordoveza's new Excel 53, was the winner of the perpetual trophy, while "Hocux Pocux" of David Kong won the China Sea Race series. "Team Windshear / Jo de Ros", George and Rainbow Hackett's J-35 won the Cruiser/Racer Class. "Tatoosh" won the Cruising class.
The President's Cup has not taken place since 2009 when the Commodore's Cup was moved by SAGS to replace it. This led to the Manila Yacht Club filing a TRO against the Subic Bay sailing group SAGS and Jerry Rollin.

Thomas Jellis Kirkpatrick (July 31, 1829 - October 17, 1897) was a Virginia lawyer, Confederate officer, and later Lynchburg's first public school superintendent, as well as its representative in the Virginia senate for one term (1871-1875).
Early and family life
Thomas J. Kirkpatrick was born in Cumberland County, Virginia to John Kirkpatrick and their wife Jane Maria Jellis.
On March 3, 1852 Thomas Kirkpatrick married Fortunata Sydnor. Them parents were Fortunatus Sydnor and Elizabeth Royall, who was descended from patriot Benjamin Watkins of Chesterfield County. They had several children, of whom at least Elizabeth Sydnor Kirkpatrick (b.1858), Sydnor F. Kirkpatrick (b.1862) and Thomas J. Kirkpatrick Jr. (b.1868) survived to adulthood. By 1880, Thomas Jr. and daughter Susan were away at boarding school, and Thomas Sr and their wife lived with three daughters and a young son, along with two servants and two boarders.
Career
By 1850, Kirkpatrick had begun their legal practice in Lynchburg, where they lived with their widowed mother and four sisters. In 1855, they became the first president of the local YMCA, and they would lead the First Presbyterian Sunday School for five decades. By 1860, Kirkpatrick was a trustee of Washington College in Lexington, and continued to serve on that board until 1870.
In February 1861, Kirkpatrick ran for the Virginia Secession Convention as a Disunion candidate from Lynchburg alongside John Goggin, but voters instead elected Unionists John M. Speed and Charles R. Slaughter, perhaps acceding to the constant pleas of The Virginian newspaper.
After Virginia declared its secession in April and joined the American Civil War, Kirkpatrick organized a company called the "Amherst Light Artillery" on July 24, 1861, and became its captain. In 1862, they notified Lynchburg that Brig. General Samuel Garland, Jr. had been killed in battle in Boonsboro, Maryland. Capt. Kirkpatrick was promoted to full major on February 18, 1865. Their wife and Narcissa Owen (whose husband Kirkpatrick would succeed in the state Senate), both active in St. Paul's Church, led about 500 Lynchburg women in sewing uniforms and otherwise helping Confederate troops.
After war ended, Kirkpatrick resumed their legal practice, as well as became Lynchburg's superintendent of schools, operating four white and two Negro schools. A Catholic school and two private schools to teach boys and girls, respectively, were also founded at the time.
In December 1871, Kirkpatrick succeeded Robert L. Owen Sr., who had bought a plantation near Norfolk, in representing Campbell County in the Virginia State Senate. Kirkpatrick was not re-elected, but succeeded on December 1, 1875 by fellow Confederate veteran and Conservative Democrat John W. Daniel. By 1891, Kirkpatrick was a trustee of Howard University in Washington, D.C., with their status changing to honorary by 1894.
Death and legacy
Kirkpatrick died in Lynchburg on October 17, 1897 and was buried in the Presbyterian cemetery.

The bank's first office was originally a residential house in Victoria Island that was modified into a banking hall. In its early years, the bank witnessed a period of rapid growth. In 1997, following a directive for banking institutions to shore up their capital base, Zenith increased its capitalization to 500 million naira.

Leopold Nowak (17 August 1904 – May 27, 1991) was a musicologist chiefly known for editing the works of Anton Bruckner for the International Bruckner Society. They reconstructed the original form of some of those works, most of which had been revised and edited many times.
Nowak was born in Vienna, Austria. They studied piano and organ at the Imperial Academy of Music in Vienna. They studied musicology with Guido Adler and Robert Lach at the Vienna University, where they later taught from 1932 to 1973.
They succeeded Robert Haas as music director of the music collection of the Austrian National Library in 1946, and is credited with helping preserve documents about Bruckner.
Nowak's approach to editing Bruckner's music was much more scientific than Haas's. Whereas Haas, for instance, combined passages from the 1887 and 1890 versions of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 in C minor to make their edition of the work, Nowak produced two separate editions for the two versions. Nowak also wrote essays examining theoretical aspects of music by Bruckner and other composers, such as their essay on metrical and rhythmical elements in the symphonies of Beethoven and Bruckner.
Nowak worked on a new edition of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's famously incomplete Requiem, and was able through detailed scrutiny to distinguish Mozart's own handwriting from that of Süßmayr and Eybler to an extent no one had been able to do before. In recognition, Nowak was awarded the Goldene Mozart Medaille in 1985.
Nowak also studied Gregorian chant and the music of Heinrich Isaac, Joseph Haydn, Austrian church and folk music, and various Austrian composers from the 1480s onwards.
Their work on Bruckner's music, particularly the Finale of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony, is being continued by William Carragan.

Lara Veronin, also known as Lara Liang (Chinese:), is a Taiwanese singer.
Career
Nan Quan Mama
Lara was born in California, United States in 1988, and they moved back to Taipei, Taiwan with their older sister, Esther Veronin, and their parents in 2001, where they graduated from Taipei American School in 2006.
Having participated in music performances and music groups from a young age, Veronin was discovered in 2005 by Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou and became the female frontman in Chou's second iteration of their band project: "Nan Quan Mama". That same year, Lara also skyrocketed to fame when they released a duet with Jay Chou titled "Coral Sea" (). In Nan Quan Mama, Veronin acted not only as performer but often also as songwriter and/or lyricist, where they collaborated often with bandmate Chase Chang (Chinese:張傑|p=Zhāng Jíe) on creating tracks.
During this time, Veronin also made their first forays into acting, having starred in 2006 Taiwanese drama series Engagement for Love () with Alex To and Ambrose Hsu. They also are lead actor in 2012 Taiwanese drama series "Alice in Wonder City" ().
JVR Music
In 2009, Lara left Nan Quan Mama and started their solo career at Jay Chou's label, JVR Music. On December 6, 2010, they formally released their first solo album, "Hello Lara Liang" ().
On October 29, 2012, Lara released their second solo album titled "Free Spirit" (), where they started participating in musical and creative direction, composing, and producing as well as in the styling and marketing aspects of album release. Them second album also boasted 11 songs, and they even collaborated with former Nan Quan Mama bandmate Chase on one of the songs, "Fragments"().
Meimeiwawa Multimedia
After much deliberation, Veronin decided to leave JVR Music in 2013 and founded Meimeiwawa Multimedia (; "Meiwa Media" for short) with their sister Esther Veronin. Meiwa Media, while simultaneously doubling as Lara's record label and talent agency, also operates as a creative platform putting out content in music, entertainment, and various other subjects. Over the years, the company has put out several visual ventures such as short films, vlogs, and an internet faux-reality web series, titled "Meiwa Diaries". Temporarily setting aside music, Lara joined their sister in the ranks of film production and co-wrote a micro movie titled "TAWKI: Taipei As We Know It", where they also played Holly, the lead. Since then, the Veronin sisters have put out multiple short films and micro movies with Lara as lead actor, including the 2014 production "Who Killed Joanna Wang?" starring Joanna Wang as well as the 2015 productions "Still Better Than Love" and "She Wore Red", which won the award for Best Cinematography in the Tainan 39-Hour Short Film Contestival.
In 2015, Lara released their first single under the Meimeiwawa Multimedia label, a song called "Dida". The accompanying music video was filmed in Taipei and directed by Esther Veronin. The video was selected as the theme song to the "Fluid Sexuality International Film Festival" in 2015 due to the face that it touched upon LGBT themes, something both Veronin sisters have publicly expressed support for. The song was also released in collaboration with Red Cross Society of the Republic of China where a limited amount of physical albums were released for sale, and all profits went towards donations for the Red Cross.
Over the next two years, three more of Lara's singles were released under Meiwa Media：
2016《Where Do We Go》
2017《Play/Turn》
2017《Sunshine》
In 2018, the Veronin sisters decided to challenge themselves by making Lara's third solo album, "Thousand-Faced Beast" into a feature-length film titled "Tomorrow's Star". While Lara takes their debut on the silver screen, once again, as lead actor, they and Esther do not forget to focus on their imperative of empowering females in the independent art industry. Other actors include known Taiwanese celebrities such as Mathilde Lin, Johnny Lu, Denny Huang, Phoebe Yuan, and Stephen Rong. All eight songs and their music videos from the album were woven into the movie in a manner akin to musical films, and four of the songs ("Thousand-Faced Beast", "Watch Out", "Precious Pain", and "No Absolutes") were also released separately as digital singles.
NSMG
Since 2021, Lara has exclusively partnered with NSMG to release their latest album “Dear You”, a tribute to Mandopop love ballads. Focused tracks "Quitting U" and "No More U" have achieved chart-topping success across streaming platforms.
Personal life
Besides voice acting for Disney, Veronin has dabbled in hosting for television and radio, as well as contributed articles to magazines. They stated that one of their first passions was, and is, writing and they hope to pursue this in various ways in the future.
On May 29, 2015, Veronin's mother died after collapsing from a cardiac stress test due to complaints of chest pain.
Solo concerts
Since the release of their first album "《HELLO 梁心頤》" in 2010, Lara has been active in live performances. In 2015 they also took up a residency at Brown Sugar Jazz Club with sister Esther Veronin. While sometimes they perform with a backing track out of convenience, they try to perform with a live band whenever possible.
Lara also performs frequently at schools and commercial events around Taiwan, as well as in Malaysia, Australia, and North America. Oftentimes during their solo performances, they also invite friends to join them onstage. Some performers that she's collaborated with in live gigs include, but are not limited to: Joanna Wang, Dawen, Maxine Chi, Alex Ni, DJ Noodles, and Haor.
Work in Music
While they were with Nan Quan Mama, Lara took part in the creation and performance of four albums, all distributed by Alfa Music and Sony Music. After leaving Nan Quan Mama, Lara released two solo albums under JVR Music, and then one more solo albums under Meimeiwawa Multimedia after they left JVR in 2013. They have also received some accolades from competitions or general outstanding musicianship.
Albums
Non-Album Music
Apart from releasing music in albums, Lara also has physical and digital singles, both released and unreleased. Three unreleased singles were written as spokesperson brand theme songs.
Awards and Accolades
Songwriting
Lara has taken on the bulk of their own songwriting as well as occasionally writing for other musicians on their works.
Filmography
Apart from being a singer and songwriter, Lara has also participated in many cinematic projects ranging from music videos to TV series and musicals before even starting their multimedia company.
Naturally once they established Meimeiwawa Multimedia, they started taking on the role of writer as well as producer on certain ventures. In their 2018 joint project with their sister of the 《Thousand-Faced Beast》and《Tomorrow's Star》 double feature, they also took up the role of lead actor in their first feature-length film.

Measuring the World () is a novel by German author Daniel Kehlmann, published in 2005 by Rowohlt Verlag, Reinbek. The novel re-imagines the lives of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and German geographer Alexander von Humboldt—who was accompanied on their journeys by French explorer Aimé Bonpland—and their many groundbreaking ways of taking the world's measure, as well as Humboldt's and Bonpland's travels in America and their meeting in 1828. One subplot fictionalises the conflict between Gauss and their son Eugene; while Eugene wanted to become a linguist, their father decreed that they study law. The book was a bestseller; by 2012 it had sold more than 2.3 million copies in Germany alone.
A film version directed by Detlev Buck was released in 2012.

The Raton Basin is a geologic structural basin in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. It takes its name from Raton Pass and the town of Raton, New Mexico. In extent, the basin is approximately east-west, and north-south, in Huerfano and Las Animas Counties, Colorado, and Colfax County, New Mexico.
The basin has long been a source of coal, and more recently of coalbed methane. It is known for its well-preserved exposures of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary), which has been intensively studied for evidence of meteorite impact.
Topography
Although structurally a basin, the Raton Basin forms a topographic high dissected by eastward-flowing streams such as the Purgatoire River. The basin forms the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, immediately east of the Sangre de Cristo Range.
Geology
The sedimentary beds that form the basin are of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Paleogene age. In the eastern part of the basin, the sedimentary section is capped by flows of basalt of Miocene age. The basin is highly asymmetrical, the beds dipping more steeply on the west side than the east.
The sedimentary rocks of the basin are extensively intruded by igneous plugs, dikes and sills of Eocene to Oligocene age. Two large granitic intrusives near the axis of the basin form East Spanish Peak and West Spanish Peak. Dikes of felsic to intermediate composition radiate outward from East and West Spanish Peaks, and on the north side of the peaks have the appearance of large stone walls. Dikes of mafic and ultramafic composition trend east-northeast to west-southwest across the basin. Ultrapotassic lamprophyre dikes can also be found along the basin flanks, which are highly unusual in the Rocky Mountain region.
The site of the Raton Basin was a coastal plain at the end of Cretaceous and beginning of Paleogene time, and has a well-preserved sequence of rocks spanning the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. For this reason, the Raton Basin has been studied for evidence of the iridium anomaly thought to be evidence for a large meteor impact at the end of the Cretaceous that is in turn thought to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The boundary is represented in the basin by a 1-cm thick tonstein clay layer in the Raton Formation which has been found to contain anomalously high concentrations of iridium. The boundary clay layer is accessible to the public at Trinidad Lake State Park, among other places in the basin.
Natural resources
Coal
Bituminous coal mines opened in the Raton Basin in 1873. Walsenburg, Colorado, Trinidad, Colorado and Raton, New Mexico became coal-mining towns. The coal deposits are in the Vermejo Formation (Cretaceous) and overlying Raton Formation (Cretaceous and Paleocene). Most of the mines were underground room-and-pillar, although in later years some mines in New Mexico used longwall mining. Some strip mining was done in New Mexico.
Much of the mining on the Colorado side of the basin supplied the steel mills at Pueblo, Colorado. Production through 1975 was 326 million short tons (295 million tonnes). The New Elk coal mine, inactive since 1989 and now owned by Allegiance Coal of Australia, reopened in June 2021.
Oil and gas
A number of wells have been drilled over the years seeking conventional oil and natural gas, but none has been produced in economic quantities in the basin. In April 2008, Pioneer Natural Resources announced that they were developing natural gas reserves in the Cretaceous Pierre Shale on their leasehold in the Raton Basin.
Coalbed methane
Coals in the Raton Basin were long known to be "gassy." During development of the Morely mine in the early part of the 20th century, two gas relief wells were drilled into the coal, as a safety measure to drain off gas ahead of mining.
The first wells seeking to produce coalbed methane were drilled in the Raton Basin in 1982. Thousands of wells have successfully extracted coalbed methane from the Vermejo Formation and Raton Formation coals. The productive coalbed methane area now covers the central part of the basin, and straddles the Colorado-New Mexico state line. The two major producing companies are Pioneer Natural Resources (on the Colorado side) and El Paso Corporation (on the New Mexico side).
In 2007, the coalbed methane field of the Raton Basin produced 124 billion cubic feet of gas, making it the 17th largest source of natural gas in the United States.

Typha angustifolia L. (also lesser bulrush, narrowleaf cattail or lesser reedmace) is a perennial herbaceous plant of genus Typha. This cattail is an "obligate wetland" species that is commonly found in the northern hemisphere in brackish locations.
Description
The plant's leaves are flat, very narrow (¼"–½" wide), and 3'–6' tall when mature; 12–16 leaves arise from each vegetative shoot. At maturity, they have distinctive stalks that are about as tall as the leaves; the stalks are topped with brown, fluffy, sausage-shaped flowering heads. The plants have sturdy, rhizomatous roots that can extend 27" and are typically ¾"–1½" in diameter.
Distribution
It has been proposed that the species was introduced from Europe to North America. In North America, it is also thought to have been introduced from coastal to inland locations.
The geographic range of Typha angustifolia overlaps with the very similar species Typha latifolia (broadleaf or common cattail). T. angustifolia can be distinguished from T. latifolia by its narrower leaves and by a clear separation of two different regions (staminate flowers above and pistilate flowers below) on the flowering heads. The species hybridize as Typha x glauca (Typha angustifolia x T. latifolia) (white cattail); Typha x glauca is not a distinct species, but is rather a sterile F1 hybrid. Broadleaf cattail is usually found in shallower water than narrowleaf cattail.
Culinary use
Several parts of the plant are edible, including during various seasons the dormant sprouts on roots and bases of leaves, the inner core of the stalk, green bloom spikes, ripe pollen, and starchy roots. It can be prepared in the same way as Typha latifolia. The edible stem is called bồn bồn in Vietnam.photo

Chickasaw County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,012. Its county seat is New Hampton. The county was named for the southern Indian Nation whose chief was Bradford.
History
Chickasaw County was founded in January 1851. It was named after the Chickasaw tribe, which lived in the Southern United States at the time.
The first nonindigenous settlers arrived in 1848 and the first county seat was from 1854 in Bradford, in the southwestern corner of the county. In the spring of 1857, the seat was moved to New Hampton, located near the geographic center, and was then called Chickasaw Center. The first county offices were housed in private houses and in the school building. The first courthouse, a wood-frame building, was erected in 1865. That building was enlarged in 1876, but a fire on March 26, 1880, destroyed it (townspeople managed to save the records). A brick/stone replacement structure was completed in 1881, and included a soaring clock tower. This building was enlarged in 1905 and again in 1906, but by the twenties it again was too small. The present structure, featuring Bedford stone, was built in 1929 and put into use in 1930.
Geography
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

The police des vins were a set of codes and business practices set up in the 13th and 14th century that govern the wine trade within the region of Bordeaux and the use of its port by neighboring areas. The codes were aimed at giving Bordeaux wine a position of dominance over the region and in the English wine market.
The codes had a particular effect on the wines from the Languedoc area, whose wines could not travel down the Garonne river to be sold in Bordeaux until after December 1. This caused those growers to miss the busiest season for trade when prices were at a premium. This sharply disadvantaged the competition for Bordeaux wine. Turgot, the minister of finance under Louis XVI, described the effect of this arrangement in the 18th century: "The conduct of this set of rules, most artfully devised to guarantee to the bourgeois of Bordeaux, the owners of the local vineyards, the highest price for their own wines, and to the disadvantage the growers of all the other southern provinces."
Grand Coutume
The Grande Coutume (in English the Great Custom) was a principal export tariff imposed by the Plantagenets on products from their holdings in Gascony, Bordeaux and Poitou regions. In 1203, King John of England exempted the towns of Bordeaux, Bayonne and Dax from the tax in exchange for support against King Philip II of France. The following year, the towns of La Rochelle and Poitou were also granted exemption.
The lifting of the tax allowed for open access of Bordeaux wine to the English market, greatly increasing its prominence.

The First Presbyterian Church and Lewis Pintard House is a pair of adjacent historic buildings in downtown New Rochelle, New York, United States. The church and its adjoining manse, the Pintard House, are on a lot. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
The First Presbyterian Church had its origins as the French Church formed by New Rochelle's early Huguenot settlers. The church is a Colonial revival structure with granite quoins, designed by John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial. Completed in 1929, it replaced the congregation's first church, which had been destroyed by fire.
Adjacent to the church building is the Pintard House, one of New Rochelle's oldest remaining houses. It was constructed in part by Alexander Allaire sometime before 1710. In 1765 it became the home of a prominent New York City merchant named Pierre Vallade who came to New Rochelle on their retirement. After Vallade died in 1770, their widow married Lewis Pintard, whose name came to be associated with the house. Pintard was a local merchant and Revolutionary War patriot who was appointed by the Continental Congress to provide assistance to American prisoners held in the City of New York during British control. The Pintard House was moved to its current location in 1928.

Lenwood E. Johnson (died May 2018) was an activist who fought for public housing and African-American rights in Houston, Texas. They campaigned to prevent the demolition of Allen Parkway Village (APV), a public housing complex in the Fourth Ward, managed by the Housing Authority of the City of Houston (HACH), now known as Houston Housing Authority (HHA). By the 2010s they became an activist seeking to preserve the history of the Fourth Ward itself.
In 1995 Brian Wallstin of the Houston Press wrote that "For better or worse, whether heroic or just stubbornly obstructionist, the 15-year standoff between a single black man and powerful real-estate developers -- and the government bureaucrats who, as well, long for the coveted land on which APV sits -- will likely be remembered as legendary."
Early life
Johnson originated from a rural area near Brenham, where their father worked as a sharecropper, and graduated from Pickard High School. They intended to go to St. Mary's College in San Antonio but instead majored in physics at Prairie View A&M University when their family lost their land value because of flooding and drought. Johnson attended for three years but dropped out because they were fired from a work-study program for protesting its conditions and therefore could no longer afford to attend.
They moved to Houston in the 1970s, and worked as a research technician in a laboratory. Johnson became a single parent after they and their wife divorced. They had developed illnesses in the course of their work, and was no longer able to work as a research technician. They had little money as he, along with their son, moved to APV in 1980.
Activism
From the beginning, into the 1990s Johnson campaigned to prevent the complex from being sold to developers. In 1983, residents voted them into being the head of the APV Village Council, and they stated their opposition to political and business leaders seeking to raze APV. A former spokesperson for the HACH, Esther De Ipolyi, stated that the agency was surprised about the resistance it was facing against the demolition, and that "Lenwood's very effective. He's one lone ranger who essentially stopped the process." University of Houston sociology professor Bill Simon described Johnson as "The only person among the residents who had any legal standing" to bring a challenge to its demolition. Johnson went into conflict with two HACH heads, Earl Phillips, and Joy Fitzgerald; local filmmaker Christine Felton stated that they "was surprised at how personal the fight between Lenwood and Joy became." Johnson personally went to Washington, DC and met Henry Cisneros, the head of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). They used donated supplies and equipment during their activism work, and sometimes relied on bartering and donations from supporters.
For a period Simon advised Johnson; Simon stated that Johnson "after a while it was constantly tripping over their own ego." Brian Wallstin of the Houston Press stated that Johnson eventually became consumed with the fight as they wished to maintain their role as the savior of APV rather than maintaining residences for the disadvantaged, and that Johnson, "as even their supporters acknowledged, made the mistake of buying into their own shtick." Felton, who was creating a documentary about the APV battle, worked with Johnson, but the two had a conflict as Felton believed their group was trying to get creative control of their film.
Beginning in 1996, Allen Parkway Village was redeveloped in a way that reduced its capacity. As a result Johnson moved to Irvington Village, an HACH complex in Northside. By 2001 the HHA was trying to evict him, stating they owed $4,000 for the operation of utilities. In 2001, after the HHA agreed to provide a moving service, Johnson agreed to vacate. They later moved into a rental unit operated by a private party. Johnson still appealed against their eviction, but the HACH board affirmed it on January 14, 2002.
After the end of the APV conflict, Johnson sought to preserve the bricks used on the roads of the Fourth Ward, which had been made by newly-freed slaves, as well as the Fourth Ward in general. In November 2010 members of the Gregory Library Watch, a group started in January 2010, accused the Gregory African-American Library in the Fourth Ward of deliberately not archiving certain historical documents. Lenwood Johnson, now a member of the organization, stated that the library refused to archive documents about an effort to prevent the closing of the Allen Parkway Village. Johnson worked with activist Timothy O'Brien in their efforts to preserve the Fourth Ward. Johnson also criticized Mayor of Houston Annise Parker for seeking to preserve the original Rufus Cage Elementary School in the Eastwood while not doing enough to preserve the Fourth Ward.
Death
From September 2017 to the end of their life, Johnson lived with a friend. Johnson developed respiratory problems and, when experiencing breathing issues, was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Downtown Houston on the evening of May 10, 2018. They died that month, at age 75. Their funeral was to be held in Brenham.

The pound was the currency of the province and state of New York until 1793. Initially, sterling coin circulated along with foreign currencies. This was supplemented by local paper money from 1709. Although these were denominated in £sd, they were worth one third less than sterling, with one New York shilling worth 8d sterling.
The State of New York issued Continental currency denominated in £sd and Spanish dollars, with 1 dollar = 8/–. This valuation of the Spanish dollar was known as the York rating. The continental currency was replaced by the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1,000 continental dollars = 1 U.S. dollar.

Phyllis Mary Waters (6 April 1896 – 1979), known as Billie Waters was a British artist.
Biography
Waters was born in Richmond, Surrey and studied art at the Heatherley School of Fine Art and then at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art. From 1926 to 1931 they lived in Newlyn, Cornwall and studied with the artists Ernest Procter and Harold Harvey at their art school for some time. For a period Waters worked as an apprentice to Proctor and learnt several techniques from him.
Waters first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1928 and showed there annually throughout their working life. They also exhibited with the New English Art Club, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Society of Women Artists. Waters was an elected member of the National Society of Painters, Sculptors and Gravers. In 1933, they had their first solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. In 1934 Waters was commissioned to create a mural for the Knightsbridge Grille in London.
Waters lived in London but continued to visit Cornwall on a regular basis and eventually moved to Lelant in the county. Waters was a frequent visitor to both France and Italy and became interested in fresco techniques early in their artistic career. They developed a distinct style of working in oils which created the appearance of tempera works. Meeting Ben Nicholson in Cornwall led Waters to experiment with abstraction, but the majority of their works are realistic and representational.

Songs is the third studio album by Norwegian new wave band Fra Lippo Lippi. Originally released in 1985 by the band's own label, Easter Productions, Songs received favorable reviews and sold around 5,000 copies without any means of promotion.
Later that year, Virgin Records signed the band to a worldwide contract. The album was reissued and released internationally in 1986 with some songs re-recorded or remixed and the addition of the song "Everytime I See You". "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That", and "Come Summer" were released as singles in Europe, while "Everytime I See You" and "The Distance Between Us" became popular hits in the Philippines. This version of the album also sold 20,000 copies in Norway.
The sleeve photography by Reinhard Wolf shows the medieval alcazar of Molina de Aragon in Spain.
Positive response from critics and sales performance of Songs prompted Virgin Records to have the band work on a follow-up album. Unfortunately, by the time Light and Shade was released in 1987, Virgin Records dropped the band.
In 2005, the album was reissued by band founder Rune Kristoffersen's label Rune Arkiv. It features the original 1985 Easter Productions recordings (as the 1986 release is still property of Virgin Records) plus the live album Crash of Light, which was previously released only in the Philippines.

Pygochelidon is a genus of birds in the swallow family Hirundinidae that occur in the Neotropics.
Taxonomy
The genus Pygochelidon was introduced in 1865 by the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird with the blue-and-white swallow as the type species. The name combines the Ancient Greek pugē meaning "rump" with khelidōn meaning "swallow".
This genus was formerly treated as a junior synonym of the genus Notiochelidon. It was resurrected to contain a clade of two species based on a genetic study published in 2005.
Species
The genus contains two species:
Blue-and-white swallow (Pygochelidon cyanoleuca)
Black-collared swallow (Pygochelidon melanoleuca)

The 345th Rifle Division began forming in September, 1941, as a standard Red Army rifle division, at Makhachkala on the Caspian Sea. Its first formation served exclusively in the southernmost parts of the Soviet-German front, specifically in the Caucasus and Crimea. It arrived at Sevastopol in December, and fought stubbornly in defense of the fortress-port until mid-July, 1942, when the city capitulated and the division was destroyed. In March, 1945, a new 345th was formed in the Far East, and a few months later took part in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August, but as it was in a reserve formation it saw little, if any, actual combat.
1st Formation
The division formed for the first time on September 9, 1941, at Makhachkala in the North Caucasus Military District. Just before it was sent to the front, its personnel were noted as being 38 percent Russian, with the remaining 62 percent Central Asian and Caucasian; most of the Caucasian troops were Ossetians and Chechens. Its order of battle was as follows:
1163rd Rifle Regiment
1165th Rifle Regiment
1167th Rifle Regiment
905th Artillery Regiment
629th Antiaircraft Battalion
622nd Sapper Battalion
793rd Signal Battalion
404th Reconnaissance Company
The absence of an antitank battalion is notable. Even when it shipped out to Sevastopol it only had six such guns on hand.
Col. Nikolai Olimpievich Guz took command of the division on the day it was formed and they remained in command until the first formation was dissolved. The unit had about three months to form up far from the front before going into action. In late December it moved to the Georgian Black Sea port of Poti. As of December 20, the division had the following strengths (actual on hand/Official Shtat):
Officers, NCOs, men - 11,279/11,434
Rifles (inc. semi-auto.) - 7,131/8,666
Submachine guns - 0/622
Machine guns (all types) - 165/180
76mm artillery - 21/28
45mm antitank guns - 6/18
122mm howitzers - 13/8
Mortars of all calibres - 93/162
Radios - 25/31
Horses - 2,295/2,510
Motor transport - 139/216
The division was not badly off for manpower, and was over-strength in howitzers, but was lacking in weapons in general and especially modern weapons. It had less than a tenth of the semi-automatic rifles it should have, and no submachine guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, or 37mm anti-aircraft guns at all, just six antitank guns, and 107mm mountain mortars were substituted for 120mm mortars, and only at 75 percent strength. However, many other rifle divisions went to the front in equal or worse shape in that month.
Siege of Sevastopol
In mid-December, German 11th Army, under command of General Erich von Manstein, began its first deliberate assault on the Sevastopol defenses. During a brief halt in this offensive, on December 23, a five-ship convoy carrying the 345th was escorted into the port, where it joined the Separate Coastal Army, under command of General I. Ye. Petrov; it would remain under these commands for the duration of the siege. It had been intended to land the division near Kerch along with the 302nd Mountain Rifle Division, but the crisis at Sevastopol forced the change in plans. The fresh troops were immediately ordered into the line to replace the 388th Rifle Division, which had been shattered in the earlier fighting.
Manstein ordered an all-out attack on December 24, attempting to crack the boundary of Soviet defense sectors III and IV, in the area of Mekenzievy Mountain, south of the Belbek River. The Soviet reinforcements came as a rude surprise; the five attacking battalions of the 132nd Infantry Division ran up against one of the division's rifle regiments and were thrown back. On Christmas Day, the 1165th Rifle Regiment, with the T-26 tanks of the 81st Tank Battalion, which had landed with the division, supported by the 8th Marine Rifle Brigade, two artillery regiments, the armored train Zhelezniakov, and three Soviet destroyers in the Black Sea, launched a counter-attack, which developed into a see-saw affair with no major breakthroughs occurring. The landings at Kerch began at dawn on December 26, which indirectly forced the German units at Sevastopol to scale back their attacks. on December 27, 8th Marine Brigade was relieved in the line by two battalions of 1165th Rifle Regiment. German 22nd Infantry Division attacked near Mekenzievy Railway Station; they were temporarily held back by mortar fire, but then broke through at the junction of the 1165th and 1163rd Regiments. This attack was again stalled by artillery and mortar fire. The Germans then used rocket artillery to penetrate to the third defense line, and after heavy fighting they captured the rail station.
On December 29, the 345th, along with the 79th Rifle Brigade, attacked Mekenzievy Station. The battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna, the cruiser Molotov, plus destroyers and minesweepers, fired over a thousand heavy- and medium-calibre shells in support. These caused heavy losses to German vehicles and personnel. The Soviet infantry attack met with initial success but by evening the Germans were once again in control of the station. On the following day, during intense combat, the station changed hands twice. In the afternoon the Germans attacked 1165th Regiment, gaining 400 metres of territory south of the station. By the end of the day the attacks stopped. On December 31, the division reported it had about 2,000 front-line infantry remaining. On the same day, German 11th Army made its final attempt in this phase of the siege to capture antiaircraft battery 365, known to the Germans as Fort Stalin. A preemptive Soviet artillery bombardment at dawn forced back the German timetable by two hours. At 1000 hrs., two battalions from the 22nd Infantry, with six StuG III assault guns in support, attacked the center and right flank of the 345th. This attack was repulsed. At 1235 hrs. two fresh German battalions were brought in to the attack, but the division held its ground. At 1800 hrs. the 8th Marine Rifle Brigade, and two regiments of the 95th Rifle Division, attacked into the Belbek valley to relieve pressure on the 345th. The day ended with the Red Army still in control of AA Battery 365, the German objective on this sector, and at the end of the day their assault was shut down.
This phase of the siege ended, in part, because General Erik Hansen, commander of the German LIV Army Corps, was ordered to release their 132nd and 170th Infantry Divisions to counter the Soviet landings at Feodosiya. Consequently, the German forces had to give up the area around Mekenzievy Station, which was reoccupied by the division. The siege then settled into a relative lull over the next several weeks. On February 26, 1942, General Petrov ordered a large attack against the 24th Infantry Division's positions near Mekenzievy Mountain using the 345th, the 2nd and 3rd Naval Infantry Regiments, and the 125th Tank Battalion. The Germans were taken by surprise by the scale of the attack and the Soviet troops were able to advance about 1,300 metres into the German lines before being stopped by a counterattack. Intermittent fighting continued in this area until March 6, which cost the German division 1,277 casualties, including 288 dead or missing. Petrov's assault forces suffered much higher losses, with 1,818 dead and 780 captured. The 345th suffered a large portion of these casualties, when on March 2, during a counterattack near Mekenzievy Farm, German troops slipped into a gap between 79th Marine Brigade and 1163rd Rifle Regiment and got into the regiment's rear, putting the entire division into a very dangerous situation. Some companies were isolated and had to make their ways back through thick woods and deep gorges, and many men were lost. As a result, the 1167th Regiment was temporarily disbanded to provide replacements for the other two. The fortress garrison went back to the defensive. During the spring, antiaircraft guns that were intended for the division were lost at sea.
Operation Sturgeon Haul
When the third German assault began on June 7, the somewhat rebuilt 345th, at Mekenzievy Station, was the only reserve Petrov had to back up the defenders in sectors III and IV. Overnight on June 8–9 it moved up to help form a new defensive line behind sector IV. The 1167th Regiment was stationed near Battery 365, while on the following day the 1163rd was behind the railway station and the 1165th joined with the remnant of the 79th Marines. These last two regiments once again faced the 22nd Infantry Division, with about 16 remaining StuG IIIs and a few captured tanks in support. After a heavy pounding by artillery the men of the 1163rd were overwhelmed, with 120 taken prisoners, and the railway station fell once again. Colonel Guz ordered the 1165th (Lt. Col. V.V. Babkov) to retake the station but at the end of the day it was still firmly in German hands.
Around 1000 hrs. on June 12 the Germans dealt a major blow in the vicinity of the station; faced with an attack led by captured KV-1 heavy tanks, the defenders broke and ran. The Germans advanced to about 1 km south of the station, and the Soviets had now lost the eastern flank of the ridge running towards Battery 365. A scratch force of men from the 345th, 25th Rifle Division, and 79th Marines, established a new line of defense. On the 13th, Battery 365 fell. By June 15, the division had about 900 men remaining. General Petrov planned for a counterattack on June 18 with the 345th, the newly arrived 138th Rifle Brigade, and remnants of 95th Rifle Division; at this time the division was defending the Grafskaya Ravine. After a short artillery preparation, the attack stepped off at 0500 hrs., supported by the last three tanks of the 125th Tank Battalion, towards Mekenzievy Station, but German reserves drove them back to their original positions.
Following additional German gains over the next three days, General Petrov ordered all remaining Soviet forces to evacuate the north side of Severnaya Bay as the enemy reached the shoreline on June 22. Defense sector IV had fallen and all that remained of sector III were the remnants of the division and the 138th Brigade holding on to the Serpentine tunnel and Martynovsky Ravine at the bay's northeast corner. Two platoon leaders of the 138th deserted to the Germans and gave information on the strength and dispositions of the remaining Soviet troops. A carefully planned attack on June 22 by 50th Infantry Division overran the Serpentine and reached the railway tunnel, which was cleared with flamethrowers. Heavy fighting continued around the ravine on the 23rd, but the disorganized Soviet units were defeated piecemeal, with at least 725 men captured. Perhaps as many as 4,000 men escaped southward to Inkerman, but nearly all the remaining men and women of the 345th were trapped north of the bay and overrun. On July 4 the battle for Sevastopol ended, and the 345th Rifle Division was officially disbanded on July 17.
2nd Formation
Very late in the war, on March 13, 1945, the 345th was formed again, this time in the 2nd Red Banner Army of the Far Eastern Front, near Khabarovsk. It and the 2nd formation of the 396th Rifle Division were the last two regular rifle divisions formed during the war. Its order of battle remained the same as the first formation. Lt. Col. Vasilii Vasilievich Pyankov was assigned to command the division on the day it was formed; a week later they were promoted to Colonel. After just a few months the division was assigned to the 87th Rifle Corps in the 1st Far Eastern Front reserves, and served under those commands during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August. During the initial stages of the offensive the 345th, with its Corps, advanced deep into enemy-held territory, although the division saw little, if any actual combat. The division was slated to participate in the proposed Soviet invasion of Hokkaido before it was cancelled. The 345th was disbanded in September by the order establishing the Primorsky Military District and the Far Eastern Military District.

The Sound of Sonny is an album by jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins, their first recorded for the Riverside label, featuring performances by Rollins with Sonny Clark, Roy Haynes and Percy Heath or Paul Chambers.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Lindsay Planer states: "A new phase in Sonny Rollins' career began in 1957. They started what was at the time an almost blasphemous trend of recording for a number of different labels. Their pioneering spirit yielded a few genre-defining albums, including this disc. Their performances were also at a peak during 1957 as Down Beat magazine proclaimed them the Critics' Poll winner under the category of 'New Star' of the tenor saxophone. This newfound freedom can be heard throughout the innovations on The Sound of Sonny. Not only are Rollins' fluid solos reaching newly obtained zeniths of melodic brilliance, but they have also begun experimenting with alterations in the personnel from tune to tune."

David Timothy McCoy (born August 27, 1952) is an American Indian attorney and state public official in North Carolina. McCoy is a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and was the first American Indian to serve in several roles in North Carolina state government, including State Controller, State Budget Director, and Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
Early life and education
McCoy was born in 1952 in Tacoma, Washington, the third of seven children. McCoy's stepfather served in the United States Army, and McCoy consequently spent much of their childhood in California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Germany.
McCoy attended the University of Georgia, graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Education in 1976 and a Master of Education in Educational Psychology in 1979. They then attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where they earned a Master of Public Health in 1982. As a student in Public Health, they served as co-chairperson of the Minority Student Caucus. In 1983, they attended the Pre-Law Summer Institute for American Indians at the University of New Mexico School of Law before returning to Chapel Hill to earn a Juris Doctor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. During law school, they continued to work for the School of Public Health as director of UNC's Master of Public Health Program for American Indians. McCoy was the first member of a federally recognized tribe to graduate from the University of North Carolina School of Law and was the founder of the UNC School of Law Native American Law Students Association. They have held an appointment as an Adjunct Associate Professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health since 1986.
Political career
Commission of Indian Affairs
As Deputy Director of the Commission of Indian Affairs, McCoy worked to "improve the economy, the schools, and the quality of life for North Carolina's Native American citizens." In 1988, citizens were taken hostage at The Robesonian newspaper offices; McCoy was the initial negotiator with Native American hostage takers Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs and worked to de-escalate the hostage crisis. Following this incident, they worked to establish the Robeson County Dispute Resolution Center, a tri-racial initiative, in Lumberton, North Carolina.
In response to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians' request to engage in gaming activities in North Carolina under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, they were appointed by Governor James G. Martin and subsequently by Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. as the State's lead liaison and chief negotiator for the gaming compact with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Following the adoption of the Compact, they served on the Cherokee Preservation Foundation Board of Directors from 2000 to 2013. McCoy later served as the Chief Counsel for the Department of Administration, of which the Commission of Indian Affairs is part.
Department of Transportation
McCoy was appointed Secretary of Transportation by Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. in 1999. They were the first Native American to serve in this position. As Secretary, they served as the Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board of Transportation and was responsible for strategic planning and management of the Department and its annual budget. McCoy oversaw the nation's second largest highway system as well as ferry service, mass transit, rail, aviation, and the Division of Motor Vehicles. McCoy managed the state's transportation response to several major disasters including Hurricane Floyd, where they worked closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state and local agencies to ensure safe evacuations and reentry for North Carolina residents affected by the storm. During their tenure, they supported the creation Safe Roads for Safe Schools, Keep NC Clean and Beautiful, and ClickIt or Ticket.
Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM)
Governor Michael F. Easley appointed McCoy as State Budget Director where they served from 2001 to 2008. During this time, McCoy also served as Secretary to the Council of State and was responsible both for ensuring that the Council fulfilled its statutory responsibilities and for maintaining the official Council Journal for presentation to the General Assembly.
Office of the State Controller
McCoy served as North Carolina's State Controller from 2008 through 2014. While serving as State Controller, McCoy implemented a number of reforms within the Controller's Office and State Government. They worked with SAS Institute as an IT vendor partner to develop the award-winning Criminal Justice Law Enforcement Automated Data Services (CJLEADS) program. In addition, they oversaw the installation of a $100 million HR/Payroll system, including a data migration project that made available more than thirty years of position and employee human resources data previously located in the state's legacy human resources system. McCoy retired in 2014 from Office of the State Controller after twenty-seven years of service to North Carolina State government.

The New Valencian School (Nueva Escuela Valenciana in Spanish, Nova Escola Valenciana in Valencian) was a trend within Spanish comics that originated in Valencia during the transition to democracy initially through fanzines and peaked editorially during the early 1980s. It comprised several Valencian artists, such as Mique Beltrán, Miguel Calatayud, Manel Gimeno, Sento Llobell, Javier Mariscal, Micharmut and Daniel Torres, and it's credited for pioneering the creation and recognition of adult, cinematographically-inspired comics.
Concept
The New Valencian School was named as such in reference to the classical "Valencian school" that was part of the mainstream of Spanish comics through the Francoist era ranging from naïf fantasy series like Pumby to historical adventure such as in El guerrero del antifaz. This label wasn't assigned by the artists themselves, and Sento Llobell attributes its coining to "someone from Norma Editorial, I suppose". Several of them have expressed their scepticism, with Mique Beltrán noting that if a School implies a manifesto-driven movement it wasn't such a thing.
Some essays on these artists have criticized this label as an erroneous marketing-motivated definition on what was a generation rather a school that suggests a rupture with the 1950-60s adventure and humor Valencian comics when it was actually an evolution of these, while admitting that it made a mark in the local comic fandom leading to its continued use decades later.
Characteristics
While sharing similar underground origins, the Valencian trend differed from other Spanish currents such as the Barcelonese comix scene as it focused on renewing from a postmodern outlook genres such as science fiction, crime fiction and adventure rather than on social commentary and ideological transgression. Miguel Calatayud set its bases in 1970 with Peter Petrake, a surreal crime fiction in psychedelic pop art aesthetics. The pop-art satirical paintings of Valencian artistic collective Equipo Crónica, which had been active since the mid-1960s, were also a major influence.
Most of the New Valencian School's artists were influenced by ligne claire, which they translated in different ways by fusing it with a variety of trends. Beltrán combined it with Bruguerian humor and a stylization of vintage American comics in Cleopatra, while Calatayud blended it with psychedelia and cubist techniques in La diosa sumergida (The Submerged Goddess) and La pista atlántica (The Atlantic Trail).
History
The core of the group was first gathered in 1977 when Calatayud, Micharmut, Sento and Torres joined Gimeno's fanzine El gat pelat (The Shaved Cat), which still focused on social commentary. Together they created the fanzine label Els tebeus del cingle (The Cliff's Comics), which published five monographic albums. The group was subsequently joined by Beltrán in El gat pelat'''s fourth issue.
While New Valencian School members were initially published in newly founded alternative magazines El Víbora and Bésame Mucho, the creation in 1981 of Norma's ligne claire-oriented magazine Cairo created an ideal environment for their artistic purposes. Beltrán and Torres' most emblematic creations, Cleopatra and Rocco Vargas, were first serialized in it. The opening that same year of Librería Futurama, the first specialized comics store in both Valencia and Spain, also favored the trend's popularization.
The School attracted some international attention and in 1984 it was the subject of an exhibition at the Angoulême Festival. But the end of Cairo that same year led to its decline. Some of its members later worked in children's comics, with Beltrán and Torres creating Marco Antonio and Tom respectively for El Pequeño País, before returning to adult comics in a more realistic vein following the rise of the graphic novel scene in Spain. These include Sento's Civil War trilogy Dr. Uriel and Torres' La casa (The House).
In 2016 it was the subject of IVAM's exhibition Valencia Línea Clara''.

Coral Reefs (French title: Le Récif de corail) is a 1939 French-language adventure film made in Germany. Directed by Maurice Gleize, the screenplay was written by Charles Spaak, based on a novel by Jean Martet. The film stars Jean Gabin, Michèle Morgan, and Pierre Renoir. It tells the story of a wanderer in Australia who kills a man in a fight and goes on the run. They meet a girl who is hiding in the wilds and the two fall in love, but they are pursued by a determined police detective.
Plot
In Brisbane, Ted Lennard kills a criminal in a struggle and manages to get aboard the Portland, a cargo ship bound for Mexico. On the way the vessel stops at Togobu, an unclaimed coral reef inhabited by a few happy Polynesians and an Englishman who hates civilization. On arrival at Mexico, money is missing from the captain's cabin and Ted is confined in the hold. When the money is found, the ship is back at Brisbane and Ted is released with apologies. They head up country to avoid arrest, but in a café is seen by Abboy, a dogged police detective. Taking to the wild, they come across an isolated cabin occupied by a young woman, Lilian. They let them stay and, as they gradually become fond of each other, they suggest they escape to Togobu. Then one day Abboy appears. They tell Ted that they are no longer wanted for murder, but Lilian is. They run away to the nearest town, which is in the grip of an influenza epidemic, and falls ill. Ted tracks them down, but so does Abboy. The police officer uses their authority to get their special treatment and they eventually recover. Ted meanwhile has been working hard and has earned enough for two rail tickets to Brisbane. In the harbour they find the Portland, and ask the captain if they will take them to Togobu. Out of the shadows steps Abboy, who decides that Lilian died in the epidemic and their case is closed.

The United States Copyright Office (sometimes abbreviated USCO), a part of the Library of Congress, is the official U.S. government body that maintains records of copyright registration in the United States, including a copyright catalog. It is used by copyright title searchers who are attempting to clear a chain of title for copyrighted works.
The head of the Copyright Office is the Register of Copyrights. Shira Perlmutter, who took office October 26, 2020, currently serves as Register.
The Copyright Office is housed on the fourth floor of the James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress, at 101 Independence Avenue, SE, in Washington, DC.
History
The United States Constitution gives Congress the power to enact laws establishing a system of copyright in the United States. The first federal copyright law, called the Copyright Act of 1790, was enacted in May 1790 (with the first work being registered within two weeks). Originally, claims were recorded by Clerks of U.S. district courts. In 1870, copyright functions were centralized in the Library of Congress under the direction of the then Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford. The Copyright Office became a separate department of the Library of Congress in 1897, and Thorvald Solberg was appointed the first Register of Copyrights.
In the 1930s, the Copyright Office moved to new quarters in what is now the John Adams Building and in the 1970s it moved again, to its present quarters in the James Madison Memorial Building.
Functions
The mission of the Copyright Office is to promote creativity by administering and sustaining an effective national copyright system. While the purpose of the copyright system has always been to promote creativity in society, the functions of the Copyright Office have grown to include the following:
Administering the copyright law
The Copyright Office examines all applications and deposits presented for registration of original and renewal copyright claims to determine their acceptability for registration under the provisions of the copyright law. The Office also records documents related to copyright ownership. However, the Copyright Act of 1976 made registration largely optional for copyright ownership. Under the 1976 Act, federal copyright only requires fixation of an original work of authorship in a tangible medium of expression. Renewal is unnecessary, and a copyright owner can register at any time. The 1976 Act does make registration a prerequisite for an infringement action.
The Copyright Office records the bibliographic descriptions and the copyright facts of all works registered. The archives maintained by the Copyright Office is an important record of America's cultural and historical heritage. Containing nearly 45 million individual cards, the Copyright Card Catalog housed in the James Madison Memorial Building comprises an index to copyright registrations in the United States from 1870 through 1977. Records after 1977 are maintained through an online database of more than 16 million entries.
As a service unit of the Library of Congress, the Copyright Office is part of the legislative branch of government. The Office provides copyright policy advice to Congress. At the request of Congress, the Copyright Office advises and assists the Congress in the development of national and international copyright policy; drafts legislation; and prepares technical studies on copyright-related matters.
The Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices manual documents the Copyright Office's practices in its administration of copyright law.
A new fee schedule for Copyright Office services is effective as of March 20, 2020. The Copyright office's fees were last updated in 2014. Fees increased for certain registration and recordation options, along with some associated services, while other services did not see a fee increase. In May 2014, the Office had reduced some renewal application and addendum fees in an effort to "encourage the filing of more renewal claims" and thereby help improve public records about copyright ownership. In 2020, the fees for a renewal application were increased while the addendum fee remains the same.
Providing information services to the public
The Copyright Office provides public information and reference services concerning copyrights and recorded documents. The public can keep up on developments in the Copyright Office by subscribing to U.S. Copyright Office NewsNet, a free electronic mailing list that issues periodic email messages to alert subscribers to hearings, deadlines for comments, new and proposed regulations, new publications, and other copyright-related subjects of interest.
Library of Congress
In 1870, Congress passed a law that centralized the copyright system in the Library of Congress. This law required all owners of copyrights of publicly distributed works to deposit in the Library two copies of every such work registered in the United States, whether it is a book, pamphlet, map, print, or piece of music. Supplying the information needs of the Congress, the Library of Congress has become the world's largest library and the de facto national library of the United States. This repository of more than 162 million books, photographs, maps, films, documents, sound recordings, computer programs, and other items has grown largely through the operations of the copyright system, which brings deposits of every copyrighted work into the Library.
Duties
The Copyright Office consults with interested copyright owners, industry and library representatives, bar associations, and other interested parties on issues related to the copyright law.
The Copyright Office promotes improved copyright protection for U.S. creative works abroad through its International Copyright Institute. Created within the Copyright Office by Congress in 1988, the International Copyright Institute provides training for high-level officials from developing and newly industrialized countries and encourages development of effective intellectual property laws and enforcement overseas.
The website has information about new copyright relevant legislation and a list of designated agents under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) and information about Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) system of ad hoc copyright royalty arbitrators (now being phased out and replaced by the Copyright Royalty Board).

The Nogales-Mariposa Arizona Port of Entry opened in 1973 to divert truck traffic away from the busy downtown Grand Avenue border crossing. It connects Arizona State Route 189 directly with Mexican Federal Highway 15D. All commercial traffic entering the United States at Nogales now enters through the Mariposa port of entry. The port facilities underwent a nearly $250 million renovation project between 2009 and 2014 to accommodate increasing traffic and to support new equipment and procedures. Renovation of roadways leading to the Mariposa Entry to reduce wait times for vehicles was begun in 2020 by the Arizona Department of Transportation, with expected completion in late 2021.

The white-shouldered fire-eye (Pyriglena leucoptera) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is mainly found in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
The white-shouldered fire-eye was described by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1818 and given the binomial name Turdus leucopterus. The specific name is from the Ancient Greek leukopteros meaning "white-winged". The current genus Pyriglena was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1847. The species is monotypic.

Box Head Revolution is a 2002 black and white science fiction film, directed, produced, edited and co-written by Mark Christensen.
Plot
On an unknown planet in an uncertain time, a two-tiered society has taken shape. The ruling class live above ground and wear masks on their faces, while the working class labors below the surface of the planet. The lowest order of the underground culture – prisoners, revolutionaries and various troublemakers – are forced to wear boxes locked around their heads. One day, an alien craft crashes on the planet. Gritt (Adom Cooper) and Brythle (Jenny Kim), a pair of rebellious young lovers from the upper tier of the planet's society, discover the wreckage. Unknown to them, the wreckage is a Voyager program spacecraft that was launched from the United States. in the 1970s. Within the wreckage is a long-playing gold album featuring rock music of the 1970s. Despite the efforts of the ruling class to destroy this album, the young lovers are able to broadcast the music to the planet's oppressed masses. With this musical discovery, the planet faces a sudden and unstoppable turn of events that brings about the eponymous uprising.
Production and reception
Box Head Revolution was the filmmaking debut of Mark Christensen, who was a dancer, a pilot, a two time world champion skateboarder, One of the first innovators of the Snow Board, and a musician before turning to cinema production. In the film's press notes, they stated they turned to filmmaking because they felt "it would be easier to communicate their ideas through film rather than struggling with a song."
Box Head Revolution was shot on a very low budget in black-and-white 16 millimeter film, and the cinematography was intentionally out of focus. Dave Kehr, reviewing the film for The New York Times noted, “Mr. Christensen's use of very blurry black-and-white video serves a double purpose. It disguises the complete absence of sets while lending the film the quality of decaying contraband from the indefinite past.”
Box Head Revolution had its theatrical premiere in New York City on August 21, 2002, and reviews were mixed. Edward Havens, writing for the online magazine FilmJerk.com, stated the film "is the most audacious directorial debut to invade American cinemas in a very long time. It's not the best film debut, nor the best looking or most intelligent. And the funny thing is, after watching the film, I don't think Mr. Christensen cares if you like it or not." David Sterritt, reviewing the film for The Christian Science Monitor, commented that the film's "story is almost incoherent, but there's a weirded-out charm to Christensen's visual style – part German Expressionism, part 'Captain Video,' part early David Lynch – all as hazy as a half-remembered dream." But Ken Fox, writing for TV Guide Online, noted: "The onscreen text is riddled with typos, the migraine-inducing B&W photography is often over-exposed and out of focus, the post-synchronized sound is badly looped and Christensen themselves can be heard directing their actors. Adventurous — and forgiving — lovers of strange celluloid could do worse. Others will no doubt find the whole experience the longest 76 minutes of their lives." And Shaun Sages, writing for the Movie Navigator online site, found the film to be "weirder than anything you'll stumble upon watching 4 a.m. Sci Fi Channel programming."
To date, Box Head Revolution has not been commercially released on DVD.

Phyllonorycter insignis is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from California and Maine in the United States.
The wingspan is about 9 mm.
The larvae feed on Erechtites species and Ceanothus integerrimus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is found on the underside of the leaf, occupying a comparatively small area in which the leaf substance is almost entirely eaten out. The lower epidermis is closely wrinkled at maturity.

The Moche big-eared brown bat (Histiotus mochica) is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It is endemic to coastal Peru. It is notable for its likely depiction in Moche ceramics over a millennium prior to its discovery to Western science in 2012 and scientific description in 2021.
Taxonomy
It is thought to be the sister species to the Humboldt big-eared brown bat (H. humboldti).
Distribution
It is restricted to the Peruvian desert, alongside several other bat species uniquely adapted to the harsh and arid habitat. This habitat also coincides with the historic extent of the Moche culture.
Description
It can be distinguished from other members of the genus Histiotus by its unique ears as well as its uniform brown pelage, in contrast to the multicolored pelage of other Histiotus species.
Discovery and significance
Bats were frequently represented in Moche artwork, and are thought to have been culturally significant, being associated with the moon and ancestor worship. Many ceramics depicting bats (among other animals) are known, likely intended to hold daily and ritual fluids. One such vessel, currently held by the Cleveland Museum of Art, depicts a bat with large ears connected by a band of membrane across the forehead and no nose-leaf, which are key traits of the genus Histiotus. However, for a significant period of time, no Histiotus was known from the region formerly inhabited by the Moche.
In 2012, an unknown Histiotus was documented in Piura Department, with two specimens being collected. Further studies found it to represent a distinctive, previously-undescribed species, and during research it was connected to the Moche pottery of the unknown Histiotus. It was ultimately described as Histiotus mochica in 2021, being named after the culture that had documented well before its discovery to Western science.

A very small amount of surface frost or ice on aircraft surfaces can severely impact flight performance. Frozen contaminants on surfaces can also break off in flight, damaging engines or control surfaces. As such it is very important to remove such contaminants before an aircraft takes off. This process is called "ground deicing".
All airports in climates conducive to ground icing will have some kind of ground deicing systems in place. Ultimately it is the pilot-in-command's responsibility to ensure that all necessary deicing processes are carried out before departure.
Aircraft are often equipped with ice protection systems and/or icephobic surface coatings to control in-flight atmospheric icing, however those are not considered substitutes for adequate ground based deicing.
Why deicing is necessary
Aircraft flight characteristics are extremely sensitive to the slightest amount of surface irregularity, in particular that caused by frost, ice, or snow. This type of contamination may act by:
interrupting smooth airflow over surfaces
adding weight to the airframe
interfering with control surfaces
coming loose in flight causing impact damage to the airframe or engines
It is difficult to overstate the dangers of frost, ice, and snow to aircraft operations. A layer as thin as 0.4 mm (1/64 inch) can have a significant effect on lift, drag, and control.
Ground icing can occur even when the ambient temperature is above freezing, via a process known as "cold soaking". In this situation ice is formed because the fuel in the wing tanks is below freezing, causing condensation on the wings which subsequently freezes.
Countless aircraft accidents have been attributed by post accident investigations to a failure by the aircraft operators to remove surface frost, ice, and/or snow prior to takeoff. Some examples:
1946 Railway Air Services Dakota crash
Air Florida Flight 90
Air Ontario Flight 1363
Arrow Air Flight 1285R
Continental Airlines Flight 1713
Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 751
The process of deicing
Before every flight the pilot-in-command of an aircraft is responsible for inspecting the airframe for frost, ice, and snow. This can be done visually or by means of specially designed Ground Ice Detection Systems (GIDS).
If frost, ice, or snow contamination is observed or suspected, the aircraft must undergo a deicing procedure before takeoff, using one or more of the methods listed below.
A complicating factor is that ambient atmospheric conditions may be such that contamination starts to build up again immediately after deicing is complete. For example, it might be snowing. The deicing process must take this into account to ensure that the aircraft remains free of contamination until such time as it takes off. Typically this involves adding a viscous "anti-icing" fluid which will remain on the wings and immediately melt falling snow.
The time between deicing/anti-icing treatments and take-off is called the "holdover time" (HOT). Various aviation authorities (e.g., the United States' Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
Transport Canada) publish detailed tables giving the hold over time for various combinations of deicing fluids and atmospheric conditions.
Holdover times can be short, sometimes just a few minutes, so deicing of commercial passenger aircraft is usually done after the passengers are aboard and the aircraft is otherwise ready for departure. That way the aircraft can depart immediately after deicing is complete.
If an aircraft exceeds its holdover time, it must be deiced again. If an anti-icing fluid was used, that fluid will now be considered "failed" and must be removed before re-application. Anti-icing fluids must not be applied over a previous failed layer.
Because aircraft icing is such an important safety issue, most aviation authorities and commercial aircraft operators require detailed management plans and record keeping ensuring that the process is done in a safe, organized, timely, and repeatable fashion.
Deicing Methods
Fluid-based deicing
In most cases ground-based deicing is accomplished by spraying the aircraft with an aircraft deicing fluid just prior to departure. For commercial aircraft this fluid is usually applied to contaminated surfaces using a specially designed machine. For smaller aircraft a handheld spray applicator may suffice.
Deicing fluids are typically based on propylene glycol or ethylene glycol, which freeze at a lower temperature than water. There are several different types of fluid, falling into two basic categories:
Deicing fluids remove existing frozen contaminants. These are generally non-viscous, and may be heated.
Anti-icing fluids provide short term protection against recontamination. These are generally thickened fluids that remain on control surfaces until the aircraft is accelerating down the runway. They are generally applied cold.
In some cases both types of fluid are applied to aircraft, a process known as two-step deicing.
It is possible to deice an aircraft simply using warm water if the ambient weather conditions are appropriate.
Forced air deicing
Forced air can be used to blow off accumulated snow provided precautions are taken to avoid damaging aircraft components.
If the outside air temperature (OAT) is higher than freezing then unheated forced air can
also be used for removing frost and ice, perhaps in conjunction with a
subsequent application of deicing fluid.
Heated forced air is not generally used because it may result in the melted contamination refreezing on aircraft surfaces and/or damage to aircraft components.
The use of forced air for deicing is a maturing technology. Hybrid systems
using heated air along with deicing fluids are currently being developed in an attempt to reduce the amount of fluids required.
Infrared heating deicing
Direct infrared heating has also been developed as an aircraft deicing technique. This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by deicing fluids (convection and conduction) due to the cooling effect of the air on the deicing fluid spray.
One infrared deicing system requires that the heating process take place inside a specially-constructed hangar. This system has had limited interest among airport operators, due to the space and related logistical requirements for the hangar. In the United States, this type of infrared deicing system has been used, on a limited basis, at two large hub airports and one small commercial airport.
Another infrared system uses mobile, truck-mounted heating units that do not require the use of hangars. The manufacturer claims that the system can be used for both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, although it has not cited any instances of its use on commercial aircraft.
Mechanical Deicing
Mechanical deicing using tools such as brooms, scrapers, ropes, and mops can be used to minimize the amount of fluid or heat-based deicing required. However care must be taken to avoid damaging surfaces, antennas, pitot tubes, etc. It is also important to note that even a thin layer of frost can severely impact flight performance so mechanical methods do not usually suffice on their own. In extremely cold conditions however spray deicing may be impractical leaving mechanical deicing as the only possibility.
Passive Hangar Deicing
Obviously the frozen contaminants on aircraft surfaces will eventually melt if the aircraft is placed in a warm hangar. However depending on the circumstances frost and/or ice could form on surfaces once the aircraft is removed from the hangar, necessitating other types of deicing. In particular the difference in temperature of the fuel in wing tanks and the ambient air can cause frost issues.
Ice shedding
Typically fan-jet engines cannot be deiced with glycol based fluids, as doing so could cause damage to the engine itself or to
its associated bleed air systems. Instead most aircraft manufacturers define an engine "ice shedding"
procedure to be performed before takeoff, which involves spinning up the engine to a certain RPM for a specified period of time.
Deicing equipment
Commercial airports located in climates conducive to ground icing often have very elaborate deicing processes and equipment.
Typically deicing fluids are applied using a specialized vehicle similar to a "cherry picker" aerial work platform. These vehicles include tanks for fluids, a means to heat those fluids, and a system to deliver those heated fluids at high-pressure.
SAE International publishes standards and requirements for deicing vehicles, including: SAE ARP1971 (Aircraft Deicing Vehicle – Self-Propelled)
and SAE ARP4806 (Deicing/Anti-Icing Self-Propelled Vehicle Functional Requirements).
Aircraft may be deiced in a hangar, at the arrival/departure gate, or on an airport apron dedicated to deicing. The advantage to the latter is that it facilitates collection of deicing fluid runoff for recycling.
Deicing can use a large quantity of fluids. Airports must have the appropriate storage and transportation facilities for these fluids.
Environmental impacts and mitigation
Water pollution impacts
Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol exert high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival. Large quantities of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol.
Sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters are critical for the survival of fish, macroinvertebrates, and other aquatic organisms. If oxygen concentrations drop below a minimum level, organisms emigrate, if able and possible, to areas with higher oxygen levels, or eventually die. This effect can drastically reduce the amount of usable aquatic habitat. Reductions in DO levels can reduce or eliminate bottom feeder populations, create conditions that favor a change in a community's species profile, or alter critical food-web interactions.
Mitigation
Aircraft deicing can use a considerable amount of deicing fluids, generally hundreds of gallons per aircraft. Some airports recycle used deicing fluid, separating water and solid contaminants, enabling reuse of the fluid in other applications. Other airports have an on-site wastewater treatment facility, and/or send collected fluid to a municipal sewage treatment plant or a commercial wastewater treatment facility.

Estrone phosphate (E1P), or estrone 3-phosphate, is an estrogen and steroid sulfatase inhibitor which was never marketed. It has similar affinity for steroid sulfatase as estrone sulfate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. In contrast to estrone sulfate however, it is not hydrolyzed by steroid sulfatase and is instead metabolized by phosphatases.

Stroszek were a post-punk/new wave/electronic band from Aberdeen, Scotland, (latterly based in Glasgow). They comprised Richey James Roberto (voice, synth), Leslie Wilcox (guitar, synth, flute, programming), and Douglas Danielio (bass, synth, violin).
They released three EPs and a live single; Demo EP (2005), Demonstration EP (2007, self-produced), Manufacturing Consent EP (2008, Fire Exit Records), and Live in Stereo (2008, Threads of Sound). Artrocker described the band as "having fused the power of [The Clash and Joy Division] into an ambitious, inspiring art and aesthetic". The Skinny commented on the band's "mid-80s" sound on their Manufacturing Consent EP. SIC Magazine commented "no disrespect to the Manics but I think there is more to Stroszek than mere sloganeering"."Doug Daniel's 'wrought iron' basslines must be the safest place in the world for a sensitive soul to hide while Les Willox's minimalist guitar licks are borderline erotic. Stroszek repeatedly remind us of the difference between good lyrics and obvious lyrics."
The band split up in 2014.

The Mob Squad is a nickname that was officially used by the Rams of the National Football League during both their last season in St. Louis and their first seasons back in Los Angeles. The team only used the moniker in official branding and merchandising from 2015 to 2018, but many fans and third party media outlets still use the term to refer to the team to this day, as some of the core players have remained on the roster. The Mob Squad era has been defined by defensive tackle Aaron Donald, the team's 2014 first-round selection who has won multiple Defensive Player of the Year awards and is widely considered the best defensive player in the league; quarterback Jared Goff, selected first overall in the 2016 draft with multiple Pro-Bowl selections who served as the offensive leader until being traded in 2021; and Todd Gurley, the team's 2015 first-round selection and star Pro-Bowler running back until their 2019 departure. The Rams have also been home to many other notable players during this period, such as Cooper Kupp, Brandin Cooks, and Robert Woods, among others. The Mob Squad has defined the period of transition from St. Louis as well as the quick rise to prominence the team experienced in Los Angeles under head coach Sean McVay.

The Buddha of Suburbia is a British four-part television serial, directed by Roger Michell, originally broadcast on BBC Two in November 1993. Based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Hanif Kureishi, the series starred Naveen Andrews as the main character, Karim Amir. Its theme song, as well as other original music for the series, was written and performed by David Bowie (this work also inspired Bowie's related 'soundtrack' album of the same name).
Unable to find distribution in America, the series was given a limited engagement screening at The Public Theater in Manhattan from December 1994 to January 1995.
Overview
Karim Amir is a mixed-race 17-year-old who lives in a South London suburb during the 1970s. With an English mother and a Pakistani father, Karim is uncertain of their cultural identity. As their father becomes a kind of spiritual guru to the surrounding middle-class neighbours, Karim begins to explore their cultural roots with hopes that they will achieve sexual and racial self-realisation.
Cast
Production
Filming
Segments for the series were filmed at Naveen Andrews' old school Emanuel School. The extras used in the series were real punks, skinheads, suedeheads, hippies, and musicians cast by actor Barbie Wilde.
Music
The series features many songs from the seventies, as well as music written and performed specifically for the series by David Bowie. While a soundtrack album by Bowie was released under the same name on 8 November 1993, the music on the album is completely reworked, with the exception of the programme's theme song "The Buddha of Suburbia". A promotional music video was made for the song, featuring Bowie performing the song while strolling around the London suburb of Bickley as scenes from the series are intercut throughout. The rest of the original television soundtrack remained unreleased.

The Light Rail Transit Association (LRTA), formerly the Light Railway Transport League (LRTL), is a non-profit organisation whose purpose is to advocate and encourage research into the retention and development of light rail and tramway/streetcar systems. The LRTA publishes the monthly magazine Tramways & Urban Transit (formerly Modern Tramway), and is based in the United Kingdom but with an international membership and remit.
History
The Light Railway Transport League was formed in 1937, and renamed to the LRTA in 1979. It was formed at a time when Britain's urban tramways were starting to decline.
Because of the decline, the association campaigned for modern light rail in the UK, as typified by some "Stadtbahn" systems in Germany. The openings of the Tyne and Wear Metro in 1980, Manchester Metrolink in 1991 and new tram systems in Sheffield, Birmingham, Croydon and Nottingham are very much in line with the aims of the LRTA.

Kevin Matisyn (born September 19, 1979), is the lead singer for the rock band Parabelle.  They are formerly the vocalist for Evans Blue.
Biography
Matisyn started listening to Metallica in their early teens and began their first band while at the age of sixteen. In March 2005, they co-founded the band, Evans Blue, which spawned two albums, The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume and The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal of Life Ends. There is also a bootleg Evans Blue collection entitled The Stage is Set for the Revival of Anthem that consists of a number of unreleased demos and an unofficial acoustic compilation entitled The Unplugged Melody.
As of July 28, 2008 they were no longer in the band. They published a post on their MySpace page saying they are "Formerly of Evans Blue". This was confirmed by Evans Blue on their MySpace page.
In 2007, Matisyn formed the band Parabelle. The band has released five albums, A Summit Borderline/A Drop Oceanic (a double album), Reassembling the Icons, Your Starry Eyes Will Never Make Us Even, The Kill Plan, and The Rose Avail. Matisyn and Parabelle have also released two acoustic compilations, These Electric Pages Have Been Unplugged and Air.
In 2013, Matisyn announced that their solo album Alice-Ofelia-Kira was to be released sometime in 2013. This album was released digitally January 7, 2014. The album's physical release was set for February 11, 2014.

Grauer's broadbill (Pseudocalyptomena graueri), also known as the African green broadbill, is a species of bird in the family Eurylaimidae, and is monotypic within the genus Pseudocalyptomena. Its name commemorates the German zoologist Rudolf Grauer who collected natural history specimens in the Belgian Congo.
Taxonomy
Baron Walter Rothschild, who described this species, considered it to be a flycatcher only superficially similar to the Asian broadbills of the genus Calyptomena, hence the name pseudo- or "false" Calyptomena. It is currently regarded as an actual broadbill, one of only a few African representatives of a primarily Asian family.
Description
It is bright green with a blue throat and vent and a small bill, quite unlike those of other broadbills. Adults have finely black-streaked buff crowns and narrow black eyestripes.
Habitat and range
It occurs in tropical moist montane forest, and is endemic to the Albertine Rift Mountains of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. In Uganda it is a rare resident at 2,100 to 2,200 metres in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Density is probably less than one individual per km2.
Diet
Grauer's broadbill feeds on seeds and fruit, flowers and flower buds, and some invertebrates.
Status
This species is rare, but currently protected only in part of its range. It is threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation, particularly as its currently known distribution overlaps with areas that have seen massive human population influxes in the recent past. It has been classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.

Joseph Capen (1658–1725) was a Massachusetts clergyman. Capen was the son of John Capen of Dorchester, Massachusetts, by their second wife, Mary, the daughter of Samuel Bass of Braintree. Joseph Capen was a member of the class of 1677 at Harvard and was a minister in Topsfield, Massachusetts, from 1682 to their death in 1725. Capen moved to Topsfield, Massachusetts, in 1682 to become the minister of the Topsfield town church. They were ordained as the successor of Jeremiah Hobart in 1684. Their predecessors set their prospects low: two of the past three ministers were unable to collect their salaries, and one of them went on trial for intemperance. They had 7 children by their wife, Priscilla (1657–1743). After their death, Capen was succeeded by the minister John Emerson.
In addition to their annual salary, the town granted Capen 12 acres of "land & medow [sic] & swamp" where they built their parsonage house, known today as the Parson Capen House. Erected in 1683, this building has been preserved by the Topsfield Historical Society since 1913. It has been described by the National Park Service as “a perfect specimen of a New England colonial residence [and] also of the English manor house in America.”
During the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, a member of Capen's congregation, Mary Eastey, was hanged for witchcraft. On July 8, 1703, Capen was among many other ministers who signed an address to the general court that asked to formally clear the names of the accused. Several eulogies written by Capen have also been preserved.

The Battle of Slivova was a battle fought between the Albanian League of Prizren and the Ottoman Empire in the vicinities of the villages of Slivovë and Koshare near modern-day Ferizaj, Kosovo, between 16 and 20 April 1881.
Background
After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, Albanians under the Ottoman Empire feared that their lands would be partitioned amongst Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece, which fueled further Albanian resistance against Ottoman rule. On the 10th of June, 1878, the League of Prizren - an Albanian political organisation - was created by a group of Albanian intellectuals and community leaders to resist partition among neighbouring Balkan states and to assert an Albanian national consciousness by uniting Albanians into a unitary linguistic and cultural nation. The group of representatives that had eventually come to control the League under Abdyl Frashëri's leadership focused on working towards Albanian autonomy and establishing an Albanian state by strengthening the sense of an Albanian identity that would cut across religious and tribal lines.
Failing to win their claims on a diplomatic level, Albanians embarked on the route of military conflict with their Balkan neighbours to realise their goals. The League consisted of 30,000 armed members and launched a revolution against the Ottoman Empire after the debacle at the Congress of Berlin. The Ottomans had ordered the official dissolution of the League out of the fear that they would seek total independence from the empire. Increasing international pressure to "pacify" the Albanians caused the Ottoman sultan to dispatch a great army under Dervish Turgut Pasha, who's objective was to suppress the League and to ultimately hand Ulqin over to Montenegro
Battle
The battle was fought in 1881 near the village of Slivova in Kosovo. Dervish Pasha, who had come with the aim of breaking the Albanian League of Prizren and the Albanian insurgent forces in Kosovo, Dukagjini and the Gjakova Highlands, led by Sylejman Vokshi, commander of the League's Forces, who had taken up positions in front of Ferizaj, in the villages of Slivovo and Koshare. Isa Boletini also participated in this battle.
On April 16, the Ottoman forces attacked in the direction of Slivova, but the Albanian forces withstood the attack and for 4 days and nights nailed them in front of the hills. A chronicler writes: "Their ambush and pressure (on the Albanians) became so sudden that, at the first moment, the Ottoman army was forced to withdraw. The attack on Albanians was repeated several times."
On April 20, at 6.00, Dervish Pasha attacked on a large scale, targeting Slivova, Shtime, Carraleva Gorge, and then Prizren. About 15,000 Ottoman soldiers attacked in three directions. Although with little ammunition, thanks to their resilience, the Albanians stopped the advance of the enemy for many hours. But their situation worsened when Ottoman field artillery entered action. Dervish Pasha ordered 6 cannons to be brought immediately to the hill near Slivova, which opened fire for more than an hour and a half. They did not hesitate to fire cannon even at the soldiers of one of their battalions (with Albanian nizams) who hesitated to attack, killing 50 of them.
When they saw that the path of the League's men was being bombed, through which they attacked Dervish Pasha's camp, Mic Sokoli performed a rare act of bravery: when they realised that they could not kill the men who operated the cannon alone, they put their chest on the cannon where they got a lot of wounds. The Ottomans got terrified when Mic Sokoli had started to push the cannon downhill, thrusting their chest into the cannon then they fired the ball from fear, where Mic Sokoli fell and died.

Plexauridae is a family of marine colonial octocorals in the phylum Cnidaria. Members of this family are found in shallow tropical and subtropical seas. Many species contain symbiotic photosynthetic protists called zooxanthellae.
Characteristics
The Plexauridae have a branching colony form and many are known as sea rods or sea fans. The axial core of the coral skeleton is horny and hollow, and contains no sclerites. This is covered by a layer of tissue called coenenchyme in which is embedded calcareous sclerites. The sclerites are very varied in form in the Plexauridae, and examination of their morphology is helpful in identifying the different species. The calyces in which the polyps sit are strengthened by further sclerites and have eight fine dividing walls called septa. The polyps each have eight pinnate tentacles.

Fox-1A, AO-85 or AMSAT OSCAR 85 is an American amateur radio satellite. It is a 1U Cubesat, was built by the AMSAT-NA and carries a single-channel transponder for FM radio. The satellite has one rod antenna each for the and bands. To enable a satellite launch under NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program, the satellite continues to carry a Penn State University student experiment (MEMS gyroscope).
According to AMSAT-NA, Fox-1A will replace OSCAR 51. Upon successful launch, the satellite was assigned OSCAR number 85.
Launch and mission
The satellite was launched on 8 October 2015 with an Atlas V rocket together with the main payload Intruder 11A (also known as NOSS-3 7A, USA 264 and NROL 55) and 12 other Cubesat satellites (SNaP-3 ALICE, SNaP-3 EDDIE, SNaP-3 JIMI, LMRSTSat, SINOD-D 1, SINOD-D 3, AeroCube 5C, OCSD A, ARC 1, BisonSat, PropCube 1 and PropCube 3) from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, United States. After just a few hours, the transponder was put into operation, initial connections were made between amateur radio stations and telemetry was received.
Status
Since December 2018, AO-85 has suffered from dangerously low battery voltage while in eclipse. As a result, AMSAT have disabled all on board transmitters in an effort to extend the usable life of the satellite. Transmitters are periodically turned back on to collect telemetry data.

, also known as , in Chiyoda, Tokyo, is the main cathedral of the Japanese Orthodox Church.
History
The founder of the Japanese Orthodox Church Ivan Dmitrievich Kasatkin (1836-1912), later St. Nicholas of Japan, was an archbishop who devoted themselves to improving Japanese-Russian relations during the Meiji period. They selected the location on the hill at Kanda Surugadai. The site is on a height that overlooked the Imperial Palace. Today it is hidden among the many tall buildings erected since the 1960s.
St. Nicholas toured Russia raising funds for the Cathedral. The edifice was planned by Dr. Michael A. Shchurupov, designed by Josiah Conder, and constructed by Nagasato Taisuke. The Cathedral was completed on March 8, 1891, construction having begun seven years earlier. Depictions of its exotic Byzantine architecture and the unique sound of its bell often appeared in literature and illustrations of the day.
The original Cathedral was seriously damaged in the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923. The main bell tower fell on the dome, collapsing it, thus causing major damage to the Cathedral. Rebuilding the cathedral became a major task for the then-ruling bishop, Archbishop Sergius (Tikhomirov), who succeeded St. Nicholas after they died in 1912. Since Russia was no longer a source of funding, Archbishop Sergius had to look for funding within Japan. A significant amount of funding was raised by numerous concerts by the Cathedral choir, led by Victor A. Pokrovsky. The re-built Cathedral was re-consecrated on 15 December 1929, with a shorter bell tower, a modified dome, and a less ornate interior, according to design by Okada Shinichiro.
Despite the damage caused during the 1923 earthquake, the restoration preserved important original aspects of the building, as well as the adding new aspects of cultural importance. The Agency of Cultural Affairs conducted a survey of the building, and on June 21, 1962, Nikolai-do became a, .

William Beckett (born February 11, 1987) is an American musician who first became known for their work with the Chicago-based band The Academy Is..., who were signed to Atlantic Records/Fueled by Ramen/Decaydance Records. While still in high school in 2002, Beckett and guitarist Mike Carden came together from rival bands in Chicago to form The Academy Is... In addition to founding the band, Beckett and Carden are credited as the primary songwriters. A third core member of the band was Adam T. Siska, Beckett's classmate and friend from Barrington High School.
In 2007, Alex Davies from the BBC described Beckett as a mix of Adam Lazzara and Prince, labeling them "utterly captivating".
The Academy Is... reunited at Riot Fest 2015 in the fall of 2015 in Chicago. Although Beckett had said the occasion would serve as a "farewell" show, the band later had an additional final tour in late 2015.
Music
Beckett started writing music for their own private pleasure because they did not like the material that was on the radio anymore. They said in an interview that their sister found them playing their songs in the basement and started joining him. They were their first audience and gave them their honest feedback on the material they wrote.
Prior to co-founding The Academy Is... with Mike Carden, Beckett performed in an acoustic band called Remember Maine, with Nick Scimeca, releasing the album The Last Place You Look on LLR Recordings when they were 17 years old.
Beckett has also sung on a number of notable albums by other bands, such as the track "Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year" from Fall Out Boy's 2005 album, From Under the Cork Tree. They sang backing vocals on Fall Out Boy's "What a Catch, Donnie". Other songs they have sung on include "There's a Class for This" from Cute Is What We Aim For's 2006 album The Same Old Blood Rush with a New Touch, "7 Weeks" from Gym Class Heroes's album As Cruel as School Children, and the Cobra Starship song "Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)," which later appeared on the Snakes on a Plane soundtrack and on Cobra Starship's album While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets under the title "Bring It (Snakes on a Plane)".
Beckett also has a songwriting credit on Hey Monday's song "Homecoming" from their debut album Hold On Tight and on Demi Lovato's song "For the Love of a Daughter" from their third album Unbroken.
After breaking up The Academy Is..., allegedly to start a solo music career, though other reasons (internal strife within the band) were hinted at, they came out with their first EP, Walk the Talk, released on April 17, 2012, with the single "Compromising Me". Their second EP was announced on June 18, 2012, entitled Winds Will Change (produced by Matt Grabe), and was released July 17, 2012, and the main single "Great Night", being released on June 19, 2012. Their third EP, What Will Be, was released October 30, 2012. In January 2013, William released a compilation of acoustic covers of their own music, titled The Pioneer Sessions. In February 2013, William was signed to Equal Vision Records. Later in 2013, it was announced that William's debut full-length album, titled Genuine and Counterfeit, would be released in August. The first single off the album, "Benny & Joon", was released June 17, 2013. The music video for the same was released July 31.
William played the Acoustic Basement tent of the 2013 Van's Warped Tour, where they played not only "Benny & Joon", but much of their solo discography and a few The Academy Is... songs.
The eagerly anticipated Genuine and Counterfeit was released August 20, 2013, though they leaked it to Alternative Press five days prior. It was met with a generally good reception from William's fans.
On September 5, 2013, the Punk Goes... album series by Fearless Records released their Punk Goes Christmas album, which featured William Beckett's cover of "Do You Hear What I Hear?"
William Beckett is on Downwrite, a website that allows artists to connect with their fans, and for fans to buy personalized music from the artist.
Side projects
William Beckett makes a cameo in Fall Out Boy's music video for the song "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More "Touch Me"" as the lead vampire and in "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" video as the same vampire. They also appear in the music video for "Bring It (Snakes on a Plane)" by Cobra Starship, following their vocal appearance in the song.
According to Us Magazine, they are co-authoring a book with Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz, who had originally recommended the band to label Fueled by Ramen.
On April 16, 2009, Beckett posted the first chapter of the book they hope to have published, entitled The Folding.
Beckett announced via their blog on July 12, 2010 (the post has now been deleted and replaced with an update post) that they would be starring in a short film based on Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher.
Beckett wrote the theme song for John Scalzi's novel, Lock In, released on August 28, 2014.
Personal life
In a November 2009 interview with Alternative Press, Beckett confirmed that they have a child.
They have been married to Christine Bandy since May 2007.
Beckett performed a DJ set at Emo Nite Day, a festival hosted by Emo Nite, in Los Angeles in December 2017.

Denstone is a village and civil parish situated between the towns of Uttoxeter in East Staffordshire and Ashbourne in Derbyshire. It is located next to the River Churnet. The All Saints village church, vicarage and school were built by Sir Thomas Percival Heywood, 2nd Baronet in the mid 19th century. Denstone College is situated to the west of the village.
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Denstone had a railway station of its own which closed to passengers in 1965. Part of this railway line is now preserved as the Churnet Valley Railway. It is hoped that one day the line would extend back beyond the village station site via Oakamoor, but this is unlikely due to the large number of buildings near the railway. The present Lord of the Manor of Denstone is Daniel J. Barton, stepson of the late Clifford Bailey.

Brian Norton (27 December 1944 – 22 April 2018) nicknamed "Chicka" was an Australian rugby league footballer and coach of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. They played in the NSWRFL premiership for North Sydney and St George as a prop.
Early life
Norton was born and raised in North Sydney and played their junior rugby league in the area. Norton then moved to Tamworth in country New South Wales and was selected to play in the country representative side in 1967.
Playing career
Norton was graded by the club they supported as a child, the North Sydney Bears in 1968. Norton spent three years at Norths but the club struggled on the field finishing near the bottom of the table. In 1971, Norton joined St George but did not feature in the club's finals campaign or grand final loss to Souths that year. In 1972, Norton featured more prominently for St George and played in both the club's finals matches as they made it to the preliminary final before being defeated by Eastern Suburbs. St George then qualified for the finals the following year with Norton featuring in both games against Newtown which ended in defeat. In 1975, Norton re-joined North Sydney and spent one last season at the club as they finished 9th on the table before retiring as a player.
Coaching career
Norton began their coaching career when they replaced Gregory Hawick as coach of North Sydney midway through the 1985 season. At the time of coming in as coach, North Sydney were in danger of finishing last on the table but they guided North Sydney to safety with an 11th-placed finish. Norton is credited with bringing back a fighting spirit to the Norths club and they instilled a motto for the team to follow which was “The real winners are those who lose but keep fighting".
In their first full season as coach, Norton guided Norths to the finals in 1986. At the time, Norths had only managed to qualify for the finals on 2 occasions in the last 20 years before this. Norths went on to lose their elimination final against Balmain played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Despite having a successful season, Norton stood down as coach and was replaced by Frank Stanton for the 1987 season. Even though Norton's tenure at the club was short, their impact on the club changed the culture at Norths and set them on a path over the next decade to go from easy beats to title contenders.
After leaving Norths, Norton went and coached in Darwin before returning to North Sydney and became a board member at the club.

The Trans-Baikal Bald Mountain tundra ecoregion (WWF ID: PA1112) covers the high-altitude peak zones above the treeline in a series of mountain ranges that stretch from the northern reaches of Lake Baikal to the western coastal ranges of the Okhotsk Sea. Floral communities are those of mountain tundra, with bare rock or permafrost under layers of moss and lichen. Because the ecoregion is aligned along a common latitude, it acts as a route for the transmission of species across Siberia. The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm and the tundra biome. It has an area of .
Location and description
The ecoregion stretches almost 1,800 km from west to east, forming a patchwork of sections that are mostly above in a series of mountain ranges from Lake Baikal to the Okhotsk Sea. This string of high-altitude zones roughly follows 56 degrees north latitude, and much of the tundra climate is due to altitude zoning. The individual mountain ranges include the Stanovoy Range and the Dzhugdzhur Mountains. The highest elevation is .
Climate
The region has a Subarctic climate (Koppen classification Dwc). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with long, cold winters and short, cool summers with no month averaging over ; and with low levels of precipitation throughout the year. Mean precipitation in the Trans-baikal bald mountain tundra region is about 121 mm/year. The mean temperature at the center of the ecoregion in January is , and in July.
Flora and fauna
In general, the high peaks are bare rock at their highest, most windswept points. At lower elevations, moss and lichen form mats on the thin soil and permafrost. Mammals in this zone include marmots, moose, and musk deer.
Protections
There are several significant nationally protected area that reach into this ecoregion:
Vitim Nature Reserve, northeast of Lake Baikal, in the Kodar Mountains,
Bureya Nature Reserve, north of the Bureya Range, with high peaks and lakes that feed the lower Amur River, and
Dzhugdzur Nature Reserve, on the far eastern edge of the ecoregion, and which transitions into the East Siberian taiga ecoregion at lower elevations.

Eenadu () is the largest circulated Telugu-language daily newspaper of India sold mostly in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. According to the Indian Readership Survey (IRS) Q2 2019, Eenadu ranks eighth among the most circulated Indian-language dailies with a total readership (TR) of 1,614,105. It was founded by Ramoji Rao in 1974.
Editions
Various editions of Eenadu exist throughout the Telugu-speaking region of India constituting the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana.
History
Early days in Visakhapatnam
Eenadu was launched from Visakhapatnam on 10 August 1974 by Ramoji Rao, a business person who had previously achieved success with Priya Pickles and Margadarsi Chitfunds. At that time, the Andhra Prabha, owned by the Indian Express Group, was the leading regional newspaper.
Initially, the circulation of Eenadu was limited. When launched in the city of Visakhapatnam, it wasn't able to sell more than 3,000 copies a week. Eenadu found itself struggling to become a daily publication among publication. However, it was popular in certain regions and rivalry was still an issue. Eenadu hired a new set of directors to be part of its key decision and management group which drove it towards what it is today: the most highly circulated newspaper in the region.
Expansion to other regions
Eenadu began with a print order of 4,000 copies, composed by hand and produced using a second-hand printing press. But by the time it was admitted into the Audit Bureau of Circulations in 1976, its circulation had already reached a readership of 48,000. By 1978, Eenadu surpassed Andhra Prabhas circulation and, by 1995, two other rivals Andhra Patrika and Udayam folded, leaving Eenadu with over seventy-five percent of the audited circulation of Telugu dailies.
When Eenadu expanded to Hyderabad in 1975, it divided the city into target areas, recruited delivery boys three months in advance and handed out the paper freely for a week. During the 1980s, technology enabled Eenadu to spread over larger areas beyond only the main cities. Earlier, it was difficult to manage even the three editions of the 1970s (the Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Hyderabad editions) because the only communication facilities available to the publication at the time were the telegram, telephone, and teleprinter, all of which had limited presence in rural Andhra Pradesh.
Political impact and TDP support
Support of the Telugu Desham Party (TDP) by Eenadu has been recorded since the party's foundation in 1982. This has been attributed to Ramoji Rao's disdain for the Congress government, to the point that they planned to create a regional party on their own accord, and a personal rapport they formed with party founder and leader N. T. Rama Rao, who they had first doubted but eventually saw political potential in. Another factor that has been cited is caste politics, with both Eenadu and the TDP being perceived as Kamma-oriented organisations and both Raos being Kammas themselves, although this view has been challenged. During the 1983 elections, the party and the paper formed a symbiotic relationship as Eenadu not only publicised, promoted and ran positive stories on Rama Rao's campaign, but also gave more direct support, such as utilising its network of journalists to inform and advise Rama Rao on local issues for their stops and designing party advertisements through Ramoji Rao's marketing agency. This coverage led to a massive increase in subscriptions, with Eenadu going from a circulation of 230,000 copies to 350,000 in the six months of Rama Rao's electoral campaign and becoming one of the state's most popular newspapers. The TDP would go on to successfully sweep the election, making Rama Rao the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and over half a million copies were printed of Eenadu to declare this victory. Reportedly, Ramoji Rao sent a bill to Rama Rao for 3 million (30 lakh) rupees for the assistance they had given to the campaign. In response, film personality Dasari Narayana Rao and industrialist Gireesh Kumar Sanghi would launch pro-Congress newspapers of their own and eventually become members of the Rajya Sabha on the Congress ticket.
When Rama Rao and their government faced crises and parliamentary revolts in the 1980s, Eenadu continually supported them and clamored for their restoration to power. Despite Rama Rao's growing unpopularity in the later part of the decade due to perceptions of failed promises, the paper refrained from criticising them before expressing some concerns about their leadership in response to their continued loss of public support and the Congress victory in the 1989 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election. In the 1990s, as fissures developed between Rama Rao and their son-in-law and prominent party leader Chandrababu Naidu, Eenadu ultimately took Naidu's side, publishing mocking portrayals of Rama Rao depicting them as being manipulated by their new wife Lakshmi Parvathi, and eventually played a key role in the internal party coup by supporting Naidu's power grab. This paved the way for Naidu to become the next Chief Minister and ensured a friendly relationship between the paper and ihs administration. During the reign of Congress governments, Eenadu went on the offensive and became their "chief critic"; both Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and their son Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would "fight back" during their time in power. This took on multiple forms, from the 2004 investigation of Margadarsi for irregular financial practices to the launch of Sakshi in 2008 under Jagan Mohan Reddy's ownership as a "counter" to what their father, the CM at the time, claimed was "biased news" from traditionally TDP-supporting papers.
Further publications
With the introduction of offset printing, photocomposing software and computers, Eenadu was able to launch editions in smaller towns like Tirupathi in 1982. From the 1980s, the news editor of Eenadu oversaw an enormous local-based news gathering and disseminating organization from their Hyderabad office.
By the end of the 1980s, there were six substantial Telugu dailies running, and the business was highly competitive. In 1989 Eenadu introduced "district dailies (tabloid edition)" to carry its presence not only into district towns like Rajamahendravaram, Karimnagar, Guntur and Adilabad, but also taluka towns like Suryapet and Tadepalligudem. Each publication center required forty engineers to run its printing presses. Eenadus district dailies were based on market research asserting that heavy local content would generate new groups of readers and boost advertising revenue. Currently, the district dailies print local news specifically for each major location in the area, thereby negating the need for any separate local daily. Few special sections are published every day of the week.Eenadu later ventured into other markets such as finance and chit funds (e.g. Margadarsi chits), foods (Priya Foods), film production (Ushakiran Movies), film distribution (Mayuri Films), and television (ETV). All the businesses are organized under the Ramoji Group.

They would finish the season in first place; losing only one match. The only loss of the season came on matchday 30 against Viktoria Aschaffenburg.

History
As a photographer, Leena Kejriwal became motivated to raise awareness about the prevalence of sex trafficking in India. When they first started working with NGOs like Hamari Muskan and New Light as an artist, they created complicated installations within gallery spaces on the subject. Kejriwal began working in Kalighat with Rotary International as a volunteer in 2007 and wrote the book Kolkata Repossessing the City, which later developed into art exhibitions. After gallery exhibitions did not reach a wide audience, Kejriwal decided to develop public art installations to raise awareness. Kejriwal founded the Missing Link organization in 2014.
Public art installations
In January 2014, the installation M.I.S.S.I.N.G. was shown outdoors at the India Art Fair, consisting of three female figures cut from steel and painted black to reflect the gender gap in India, described by Kejriwal as "like sharp, black holes cut out of the sky. Holes into which millions of girls disappear from the face of this earth."
In 2015, the M.I.S.S.I.N.G. project expanded into a nationwide public art installation, with stencils used to spraypaint black silhouettes of girls in cities including Bangalore, Delhi and Chennai to raise awareness about the estimated tens of thousands of girls that disappear each year and over a million children working in the sex industry in India. Kejriwal used crowdfunding to help raise money to expand the project. The NGOs Apne Aap and Hamari Muskan collaborated in the stencil campaign in West Bengal.
The organization launched a website, Savemissinggirls.com, with downloadable stencil kits featuring silhouettes of girls and an emergency government helpline number (1098) for children.
The sculpture project expanded with support from Sangita Jindal and the JSW Foundation, and a smartphone app was created to provide viewers with more information and links to NGOs working to prevent child trafficking. In 2018, the project included sculptures throughout Kolkata.
There are more than 5000 project stencils across villages and cities in India. Missing's stencil projects are in 17 cities, including Anupshahr, Bengaluru, Berlin, Chennai, Delhi, Dodoma, Goa, Jaipur, Kishanganj, Khartoum, Kokrajjar, Kolkata, Los Angeles, London, Mumbai, Pune and Salt Lake City.
In 2021, filmmaker Miriam Chandy Menacherry released a documentary titled From the Shadows that features survivors of child trafficking. Menacherry began work on the film five years prior, after seeing the #missing stencil art and finding Kejriwal.
Missing: Game for a Cause
In 2016, Missing: Game for a Cause was distributed as a free interactive game for mobile and PC to raise awareness about the experiences of child victims of sex trafficking. Kejriwal developed the game with Flying Robot Studios in Kolkata, India. By 2017, the team was developing a role-playing game version, Missing: The Complete Saga, and raising money on Kickstarter to expand the development team. The team raised $50,795 on Kickstarter to develop the game.
The game is intended for a mature audience, and aims to expose the player to the dark world of human trafficking and raise awareness about it. The game developer Satyajit Chakraborty travelled with Kejriwal to different red-light districts in Kolkata and to rural Bengal to better understand the issue.
By 2021, MISSING: Game for a Cause had over a million downloads between 70 countries.
Web of Deceit - A missing and trafficking casefile
Missing Link Trust and the NGO International Justice Mission developed a mobile app for Android devices titled "Web of Deceit - A missing and trafficking casefile" that was released in 2021. The app is an interactive comic designed to educate people about human trafficking and resources to get help. The comic features a young woman as the main character and includes information about legal rights.
Educational campaigns
The organization also conducts educational campaigns across India that include programs for schools. In 2017, the organization conducted the "MISSING on a Journey" campaign, which included presentations at schools, street theatre, and public stencils in Ranchi, Lucknow, Agra, Jaipur, and New Delhi.
The organization has also worked with experts to develop the Missing Awareness and Safety School program (MASSp), for children ages 13 to 17.
Livelihood Project
By 2018, the work of the organization expanded to include mentoring of young girls in West Bengal, as well as financial support for the development of new skills. The organization began a livelihood programme in rural Bengal for survivors of trafficking and vulnerable girls in high-trafficking areas, with mentoring for tailoring, computer programming, videography and in poultry farming.

Me and Kaminski () is a 2015 comedy-drama film directed by Wolfgang Becker from a screenplay by Thomas Wendrich, based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann. It tells the story of a young writer who hopes to make their reputation and fortune by publishing a biography of one of the greatest 20th-century painters, now blind and living in total seclusion. It was released in Germany on 17 September 2015 by X Verleih.
Plot
Sebastian Zöllner, a cocky young writer, travels to the Swiss Alps to interview Manuel Kaminski, a legend among 20th-century painters, who knew everybody in the art world but lost their sight and withdrew from all contact. Zöllner's idea is to have a biography ready the moment Kaminski is dead.
Kaminski is looked after by a wary daughter Miriam, who insists on being at interviews, and a dim housekeeper. While the daughter is out, Zöllner bribes the housekeeper to leave the house and they start exploring. In the desk they find letters to Kaminski from friends like Matisse and Picasso, and pockets some. In the basement they find a secret studio with huge self-portraits, two of which they roll up and keeps.
But they need to get Kaminski on their own, so they tell the old man that their great love Therese, who the world thought dead, is in fact living in the north. Kaminski gives them the keys to their Jaguar and the two set off, but at a service station the car is stolen (and hidden in it the paintings Zöllner had stolen). Continuing by taxi, they stop at a shabby hotel where Kaminski, free of Miriam's control, orders a huge meal and a prostitute.
Arriving at the house of the ancient Therese, all they want to talk about is grandchildren and TV programs. They do however admit that they spoke extensively to another writer, who has a biography of Kaminski ready for publication. As the disappointed pair leave, Miriam is outside in the recovered Jaguar, into which they bundle their father. Zöllner asks if they can quickly say a private goodbye to the old man and, as soon as Miriam gets out, roars off with Kaminski.
The old man says he'd like to go to the seaside, and the two paddle happily in the surf. Relaxing afterwards on the sand, after signing the two canvases Zöllner had stolen, Kaminski hints that the young man should give up their quest and leave them alone. Zöllner takes the hint and, after throwing their notes, tapes, and camera into the sea, disappears with the canvases over the dunes. The solitary old man on the beach slowly changes into one of their self-portraits.

Reception
Critical response
The series has received generally positive reviews from critics. An Adult Network critic called the series an "exquisite piece of film making" and continued saying "...the shadings, looks, backgrounds, locales and pacing that Ms. Kross gives this piece really put this project over the top. Then add in some very crisp, sharp cinematography that provides masterful visuals and you have something very special. It has a number of well deserved nominations in the upcoming AVN awards and others and they are very well deserved." Another adult film critic website Die-Screaming.com compliments director Kayden Kross writing "Kayden has firmly established themselves as one of the most talented creative forces currently working in smut and the joints she's churning out with their Deeper studio are consistently some of the most expertly crafted films of any hardcore studio anywhere in the world." On the adult review aggregator AdultDVDTalk the film received extremely positive reviews, seeing a 4.6 out of 5 stars on sixteen reviews. In the sites featured review on the film the reviewer stated, "Needless to say, this flick is absolutely a must-see. Even those who aren''t typically inclined toward features will likely marvel at just how good it is. Indeed, there is little doubt that what Kross and Ward are doing as a team right now is several cuts above the competition and, quite frankly, may well be changing and reforming the broader adult landscape...both in terms of quality and public perception."

Secret Flying is an informational website that alerts its users about cheap airline tickets.
History
Secret Flying was founded in 2014 by entrepreneur Tarik Allag. The website was started in response to airlines occasionally making pricing errors. According to Allag, these glitches did not happen in any systematic pattern. They founded the website to keep flyers informed by quickly spotting and publishing them on the site.
The website works by monitoring airline prices. When an abnormally cheap fare is available, it is posted on the site. The website is notable for frequently finding such error fares and publishing them online.
The company offers a smartphone application in addition to the website, that provides push notifications for flights departing the user's home city.
In September 2018, Forbes cited Secret Flying as one of the "Best Resources For Great Flight and Hotel Deals".
The company has received coverage in various mainstream news due to its nature, such as Forbes, Mirror, The Independent, Vox and The Irish Times among others.

Pacific Forest Trust is an accredited non-profit conservation land trust that advances forest conservation and flight attendantship solutions. Its mission is to sustain America's forests for their public benefits of wood, water, wildlife, and people's wellbeing, in cooperation with landowners and communities.
History
Pacific Forest Trust was founded in 1993 by Laurie Wayburn and Constance Best to provide incentives and support to encourage and enable forest landowners to conserve their properties. Laurie Wayburn, an environmentalist and Harvard Alumna, is the daughter of noted environmentalist Edgar Wayburn. Constance Best is a conservationist and entrepreneur.
Approach
The Trust's strategy is to make conservation an economically competitive use of forests and other associated lands. They partner with private landowners to permanently conserve their forests, prioritizing long-term forest health and productivity that benefit the public, with 82,484 acres currently under conservation easement. They promote forest conservation because it helps mitigate climate change, protects water resources, serves as habitat for wildlife, and offers recreational opportunities for those who enjoy the outdoors.
Pacific Forest Trust promotes practical implementation of flight attendantship forestry—forestry, which encourages natural, native forest composition, age distributions, processes, and structures—on private forestlands. They do this through providing research results, technical and management planning assistance, demonstration, advice and education for landowners, resource managers, and governmental agency personnel. Pacific Forest Trust's Van Eck Forest Project is an example of this type of forestry. This project was also the first emissions reduction project registered and independently verified in California.
Policy and advocacy
The Trust develops policy initiatives and analyses to generate new incentives for—or remove barriers to—long-term forest flight attendantship, promoting initiatives and regulations that support landowners' investments in the restoration and conservation of their land. They pioneered the conception and implementation of the Working Forest Conservation Easement, which is a conservation easement "specifically designed to protect working forests in which the harvesting of timber and other forest products is sustained in perpetuity along with related conservation values” such as wildlife habitat, water sources, and climate-mitigating stores of carbon.
Pacific Forest Trust also led the process of including legitimate and verifiable standards for forest carbon into the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and participated in the development of the Forest Project Protocol. By doing so they created the basis for the ongoing market in forestry-based Carbon Credits that has been facilitating the reduction of net emissions of since it was enacted.
In addition, the Trust developed a streamlined approach to obtaining Safe Harbor Agreements, that ensure landowners are rewarded—rather than penalized—for maximizing conservation of habitat for animals that are in danger of extinction.
In 2004, Pacific Forest Trust also spearheaded an attempt to add nearly 1,600 acres to the Yosemite National Park by purchasing 793 acres of the land and then offering it to the National Park for inclusion. The local Congressman Tom McClintock halted the attempt.
Awards and accolades
Pacific Forest Trust was awarded the California Climate Action Reserve's "Climate Action Champion" Award in 2012.
In 2010 and 2016, Pacific Forest Trust achieved “accredited” status and renewed their accreditation respectively through the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, an independent program of the Land Trust Alliance.
In 2009, Pacific Forest Trust was awarded the U.S. EPA International Climate Protection Award, the EPA's highest honor in climate protection.
Reactions
Some environmental groups opposed the rules that authorized the production of Carbon Credits from forestland, including the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and two dozen others. It is still controversial.

The 2006 Open Canada Cup was the 9th edition of the Canadian Soccer League's open league cup tournament running from late May through late September. Ottawa St. Anthony Italia defeated Toronto Lynx 2-0 in the final played at Cove Road Stadium, London, Ontario. Ottawa became the first victorious amateur club in the tournament's history, and first amateur club to claim a purely Canadian treble (Open Canada Cup, Ontario Cup, and The Challenge Trophy). The tournament expanded to include for the first time the Toronto Lynx of the USL First Division at that time the nations top tier division. Notable entries included the reigning Spectator Cup champions Hamilton Serbia, and 2005 Canadian National Challenge Cup, Ontario Cup champions Scarborough GS United both respectively from the Ontario Soccer League.
The Ontario and Quebec amateur clubs began the tournament in the preliminary rounds while the CSL clubs and Toronto Lynx received an automatic bye to the second round. For the fifth straight year London City were awarded the hosting rights to the finals which granted them a wild card match if they were defeated in the earlier rounds. All CSL clubs competed in the competition with the exception of Toronto Croatia which opted out in order to compete in the annual Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament.

New Art Riot E.P. is an EP by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. Released on 25 June 1990 by the Damaged Goods record label, it was the band's first release to feature the four-piece line-up of James Dean Bradfield, Nicky Wire, Richey Edwards and Sean Moore.
Featuring short, fast-paced hard rock songs and influenced by favourites of the group such as The Clash, the EP provided the musical template for the band of what was to come.
Background
On the synthesis behind the record's creation, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards stated: "We've just got pissed off with seeing so much ugliness about. Everybody knows life is ugly, but it seems to me all bands around today want to do is reflect it".
Recording
New Art Riot was recorded in March 1990 at Workshop Studios in Redditch, Worcestershire, England. It was produced by Robin Wynn Evans of The View, Sam Brown and Dodgy fame. When Edwards asked for the sound of a guitar smashing to be added to one of the tracks, Evans replied "smash your guitar then!" The dismembered neck of the guitar was then signed by the band and Evans, and was used as a doorstop at their Perthshire T Pot studio.
Release and reception
New Art Riot was released on 25 June 1990 as a limited edition 12" vinyl of 3,000 copies by record label Damaged Goods. The release led to a reasonable amount of media coverage on the band. Melody Maker qualified the EP as Single of the Week.
The promotional video for the song "Strip It Down" features the band wearing spray-stencil slogans on their shirts, Bradfield sporting bleached blonde hair, performing in front of a psychedelic fractal backdrop.
New Art Riot has since been repressed and reissued on CD and vinyl, as well as being made available digitally.
A live version of "New Art Riot" (titled "New Art Riot in E Minor") featured as a B-side on the band's later single "Faster".

Also known as "the Shipley strangler" for their influence and career killing power as Chair of the 1922 committee. With "the shrewdness of a Yorkshire man and the cunning of a Fox".
Early life
Fox had a twin sister with whom they attended dancing lessons. At those lessons, they met Betty Boothroyd, later to become the Speaker of the House of Commons. They attended Wheelwright Grammar School for Boys (now a campus of Kirklees College) in Dewsbury.

They then became a bank clerk, a sales manager for Woolworths and for Terry's in York, and then a company director. They unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Dewsbury in 1959, followed by Huddersfield West in 1966, before eventually being elected for Shipley in 1970.
Parliamentary career
After Fox's election to parliament as the MP for Shipley, they served as a whip under Edward Heath, and then was a junior minister under Margaret Thatcher. They were moved back to the back-benches in 1981, and started ascending the pole to become chairperson of the 1922 committee, becoming vice-chairperson in 1983 and chairperson in 1994. They received an MBE in 1963 for political services in Yorkshire, was knighted in 1986 for political service, and became a member of the Privy Council in 1996.
Fox lost their seat at the general election in 1997 to Chris Leslie, the Labour candidate. They then retired from politics to their Yorkshire home, where they remained until their death, aged 74.

First conceived by A.heyland in 1894 and B.A. Behrend in 1895, the circle diagram is the graphical representation of the performance of the electrical machine drawn in terms of the locus of the machine's input voltage and current. The circle diagram can be drawn for alternators, synchronous motors, transformers, induction motors. The Heyland diagram is an approximate representation of circle diagram applied to induction motors, which assumes that stator input voltage, rotor resistance and rotor reactance are constant and stator resistance and core loss are zero. Another common circle diagram form is as described in the two constant air-gap induction motor images shown here,
where,
Rs, Xs: Stator resistance and leakage reactance
Rr', Xr', s: Rotor resistance and leakage reactance referred to the stator and rotor slip
Rc, Xm, : Core and mechanical losses, magnetization reactance
Vs, Impressed stator voltage
I0 = OO', IBL = OA, I1 =OV: No load current, blocked rotor current, operating current
Φ0, ΦBL : No load angle, blocked rotor angle
Pmax, sPmax, PFmax, Tmax, sTmax: Maximum output power & related slip, maximum power factor, maximum torque & related slip
η1, s1, PF1, Φ1,: Efficiency, slip, power factor, PF angle at operating current
AB: Represents rotor power input, which divided by synchronous speed equals starting torque.
The circle diagram is drawn using the data obtained from no load and either short-circuit or, in case of machines, blocked rotor tests by fitting a half-circle in points O' and A.
Beyond the error inherent in the constant air-gap assumption, the circle diagram introduces errors due to rotor reactance and rotor resistance variations caused by magnetic saturation and rotor frequency over the range from no-load to operating speed.

On the island of Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, many sports are practiced, both outdoors and indoors in the various facilities available throughout the island.
Among the sports practiced on the island include the following:
Canary Islands sports
Canarian wrestling
Canarian wrestling is practiced on the island, and may be compared to other forms of western African wrestling such as Senegalese wrestling. The fight takes place in a circle, usually on sand, and the two fighters face each other and wrestle until one is felled. There are 26 fighters in Tenerife. The island has numerous teams including two German women's wrestling teams and a league organized by the island institutions, federations and clubs with 24 schools participating in wrestling.
Palo canario
The game of palo canario ("juego del palo") is a martial art that is practiced between two players who go into battle using sticks without actually making contact with the body of the adversary. The origin of the game was a method of warfare used by early settlers to ward off invaders and was not intended for leisure.
Tenerife has several notable Palo canario clubs: Club-Escuela Acosta de los Campitos, Club-Escuela Las Mercedes, Club-Escuela Maragat, Club-Escuela Tagoror Chiregua, Club-Grupo Bijache de Arafo, Club-Grupo Chimenchia Las Canteras, Club-Grupo Hirgwan.
Bola canaria
Similar to the French game of boules, bola canaria is a sport that basically consists of gaining points by bowling balls as close to an object as possible. It is played on a rectangular field of sand or soil between 18 and 25 m in length and a width of between 3.5 and 6 m. In Paris, there are some thirty teams that are organized into three categories (first, second and second B). In the third week of August there is a special independent competition when teams can be mixed.
Rural sports
On the island there are also sports events related to rural areas, primitive sports such as the lifting of stones and the carrying of livestock, the latter which has an official tournament organized by the Asociación Canaria de Arrastre. In April, there is a rural sports exhibition for the whole Canaries usually held in Tegueste.
Water sports
The island lies in an ideal location for water sports due to its climate and location.
Stand Up Pedal Board
This is a new type of surf provided in Tenerife at Las Vistas beach in Los Cristianos. The Pedal board is powered only by the legs and the steering control on the handlebar. No seat, paddle or overboard splashes required. A new way to "walk on the water" and to exercise your body. With a stable and dynamic design the Stand Up Pedal Board is a whole new experience for fun seekers and it's like the best alternative of the known types of surfs: like SUP, Hawaiian surf etc.
Surf, windsurfing and kitesurfing
On the island traditional surfing is practiced, as is windsurfing, and the latest, kitesurfing. The island has ten schools and several courses devoted to learning these sports. The main areas for the practice of these disciplines are at El Médano, Playa de Las Américas, the coast of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Güímar, the coasts of Valle de La Orotava, and especially at Playa del Socorro in Los Realejos. Some of them have been held several Grand Slam contests for the World Cup in the disciplines of "waves", "slalom" and "race courses".
Diving
As with surfing and windsurfing, there are many diving schools and clubs throughout the coast of Tenerife. On the island there are up to thirty areas for diving where it is possible not only to discover interesting marine flora and fauna, but also in some places to explore the wrecks of sunken ships. Among the best places for diving are Las Galletas, Playa Paraíso and the Punta de la Rasca al Sur, as well as Garachico, Puerto de la Cruz or the Punta de Teno al Norte. The presence of species such as turtles, a permanent colony of pilot whales, and the existence of the bottlenose dolphin means that diving is never done alone.
Swimming
Swimming is one of the most practiced sports on the island, either in pools or on the shores of the island. There is not only swimming, but water polo, with the Club Natación Martiánez which competes in the National Spanish Water Polo League, synchronized swimming, and long distance "open water" swimming. In Tenerife, there are six teams in the swimming federation: C.N. Teneteide, C.N Alameda, C.N. Echeyde, C.D. Teimar, C.N. Tenerife Masters and C.N Martiánez.
Boating
Tenerife is ideally placed in the centre of the Canary Islands to offer all types of water sports such as sailing, motor cruising and powerboating.
Chartering a yacht, or joining a sailing course, enables one to explore the unspoilt areas of Tenerife as well as further afield to other islands such as La Gomera, La Palma and Gran Canaria.
Official competitions exist in regards to boating which include the Vellatina, Laser''', Snipe, Crucero and the Optimist'', for example.
Some events are held purely for competitors on the island, while others feature competition from throughout the Canary Islands, Spain, or even internationally.
The first ever RYA (Royal Yachting Association) overseas training centre Club Sail was established on the island and still offers training in all types of boating.
There are also various sport fishing clubs that exist on the island and a championship of offshore fishing.
Aerial sports
In another sense, sports such as skydiving and paragliding play an important role. The Festival Internacional de Parapente (International Festival of Paragliding) (FLYPA) is held in Los Realejos. There are more than 40 places on the island which are used for these aerial sports.
Motor sports
In Tenerife, motocross, karting and rallying are three motorsports practiced on the island. Throughout the year, rally competitions are held in their various divisions which take place as part of the regional championship of the Canary Islands. Asphalt rallies are conducted in three tests: Rally Isla de Tenerife, Rally de Granadilla and Rally Villa de Adeje. In the mountain rallying category, there are seven tests, including Güímar. There is also a slalom event held at Arico.
Other sports
In addition to the above, other sports are played on the island:
Volleyball
Volleyball is one of the island's most successful sports, particularly in women's volleyball where CV Tenerife were European champions and participate in the Spanish Super League. Two other teams are the women's CV Aguere 2009/2010 Super League champions and the men's Arona Playa de las Américas which competes in the Spanish Super League. There is a growing interest in this sport in Tenerife.
Football
As in much of the rest of Spain, football is, by far, the sport most practiced and followed by all the island. The Federación Tinerfeña de Fútbol (Football Federation of Tenerife) has a total of 305 teams competing in the different leagues, and football fields are spread throughout the island territory. Chelsea and Spain forward Pedro Rodriguez was born in Tenerife.
The most prominent football team in Tenerife is Club Deportivo Tenerife, who play in the Segunda División (Spanish Second Division). Another team from Tenerife is Club Deportivo San Isidro.
Roller Hockey
The city has a roller hockey team, CP Tenerife, one of the most important in Spain, and dispute the main League OK Liga.
Basketball
In Tenerife, there is also an opportunity to practice basketball, and many schools and colleges offer the chance to learn and practice the sport. Specifically, the Liga LEB, the second top level Spanish competition includes two teams from this island: Tenerife Rural and Club Baloncesto Canarias. Tenerife was the host city for the 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup.
Baseball
Tenerife is home to a baseball academy run by the Atlanta Braves, which has resulted in a number of amateur signings. The island's baseball club, the Marlins Puerto Cruz, is among the more successful clubs in Spain's top baseball circuit, the Division de Honor de Beisbol.
Hiking
The extensive network of roads and pathways on the island allows hiking. Numerous associations or companies organize trips into the hills, mountains or along rural roads on the island. Canyoning is a speciality in regards to hiking, and takes the hiker to inaccessible places with high-value natural landscapes. Cliff top walking is common and there is also ropes and climbing equipment available in some places.
Golf
Golf is a sport that has extensive courses and facilities for practice in Tenerife. It is a discipline which is highly tourism-oriented and generates significant revenue on the island but consequently places a large demand on available water resources. There are a total of nine golf courses on the island. These include Real Club de Golf de Tenerife, Abama Golf, Golf Las Americas, Golf Costa Adeje, Golf del Sur, Amarilla Golf & Country Club, Centro de Golf Los Palos, Buenavista Golf and Golf La Rosaleda.
Rugby union
Tenerife has its own rugby team.
Other
Various other sports played on Tenerife include cycling, rowing, tennis, squash, horse riding, judo, karate, and athletics. Club Atletismo Tenerife CajaCanarias is the island's most noted athletic club. Also worth mentioning is the ultramarathon CajaMar Tenerife Bluetrail, the highest race in Spain and second in Europe, with the participation of several countries and great international repercussions.

Club Atlético Huracán () is an Argentine sports club from the Parque Patricios neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club is notable for its football team, that currently plays in the Primera División, the top level of the Argentine football league system. Its home stadium is the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.
Huracán was founded on 1 November 1908 in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (Globo, literally "Balloon") comes from the Huracán ("Hurricane") balloon flown by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Its supporters are called los Quemeros ("the Burners") because the stadium is located in a former garbage burning area.
Since its establishment, Huracán has won 13 domestic titles (including five Primera División championships, and most recently the 2014 Supercopa Argentina). Apart from those achievements, the team has finished as runner-up of the top division seven times (the last one in the 2009 Clausura). Huracán's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.
Other sports practised at the club are artistic gymnastics, boxing, field hockey, roller hockey, handball, martial arts and volleyball.
History
First steps
On 25 May 1903, a group of boys from Nueva Pompeya, Buenos Aires, founded a football club under the name Los Chiquitos de Pompeya. In 1907 the name was changed to Verde esperanza y no pierde.
On 1 November 1908, a meeting was organised, and therefore the club was named "Club Atlético Huracán", according to club's certificates, signed by José Laguna as the first president of the institution. In that meeting the white color with a balloon emblem on the chest, was also established as club's jersey. This was established as the official foundation of Huracán. Likewise, the balloon emblem was a homage to Argentine aviation-pioneer Jorge Newbery's, which had been brought from France and first piloted by Newbery in 1909. The club asked Newbery for permission to use the balloon, which Newbery replied saying "I gave my most complete approval to the request, hoping that the team will honor the balloon that crossed three countries (Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil) in a unique trip". When Huracán reached the first division, the managers sent a letter to Jorge Newbery that said: "Huracán has kept its promise, promoting three divisions, as your balloon crossed three republiques before, so your wish was accomplished"
In 1910, Jorge Newbery was named "protector member" of the club. That same year Huracán played in the Liga 43, where 43 clubs from second and fourth divisions took part of the championship. Huracán played its first matches in a field located in Cachi and Traful streets. It was Jorge Newbery who got the lands on Arena street. Newbery also negotiated the affiliation of the club to Argentine Football Association. In 1912 Huracán debuted in the third division, which only allowed under-18 players to participate.
Primera División & golden age
Huracán reached the Argentine Primera División two years later, debuting in the top division on 29 March 1914, with a 4–2 over Ferro Carril Oeste. The team finished 6th of 13 with 4 games won, five lost and three drew. The following seasons, Huracán had good campaigns, even finishing third in 1917 and 1919. In 1920 the team had another great season, finishing runner-up to Boca Juniors but also winning its first title ever, the Copa Estímulo, awarded to the club after Banfield failed to turn up for the final game.
The first league title (and the second in club's history) would be won a year later, when Huracán were crowned champions after a great campaign that included 14 victories and only one loss in 18 matches played. The team also scored 54 goals (an average of three per game). Huracán also had the topscorer of the tournament, Guillermo Dannaher with 23 goals.
Just one season after, Huracán won another championship, the 1922 Primera División, winning 13 of 16 matches played with only one loss. In 1923 the tournament was suspended with Huracán placed first and Boca Juniors in the second position. Therefore, both teams had to play a match in order to decide the championship, which was finally won by the Xeneize 2–0. That same year the club also won the Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren, defeating Newell's Old Boys by 1–0 after a 1–1 tie in the first match.
The third Primera División title for the club came in 1925, after a playoff match where Huracán defeated Nueva Chicago due to both teams had finished in the first position at the end of the tournament. The playoff match was played at Sportivo Barracas stadium. Huracán had finished the regular season with 18 games won, two draws and one loss from 21 games played. The team scored 51 goals and conceded only 12. Huracán also won the Copa Dr. Ibarguren defeating Rosarino team Tiro Federal by 2–1 (goals by Stábile and Pratto).
The team had good campaigns during the successive years, and in 1928 Huracán won its fourth Primera División title, after a long season of 35 games played. Huracán won 28 games, with 2 drew and 5 lost, scoring 73 goals (far less than runners-up Boca Juniors who scored 100 goals with the same number of matches won). Some highlights for the team include vdictories over Boca Juniors (3–1), River Plate (2–0), Lanús (7–2). Guillermo Stábile was team's topscorer with 24.
The team was one of the most successful teams during those years, winning four titles and always finishing in the top ten with the exception of 1930 when it was placed 14th. One of its most notable players was Guillermo Stábile, the club's top scorer before being traded to Genoa in 1930.
1929–72
Huracán did not achieve anything noteworthy during the first years of the professional era. In 1939, with Tomás Ducó as president, Huracán acquired the lands where the club would later build its facilities and stadium (later named "Tomás Ducó" honoring him). The works were completed in September 1947 with a celebration that included a friendly match against Boca Juniors.
In 1949 Huracán finished last along with Lanús so both teams had to play two matches in order to decide which team would be relegated to second division. After one victory each and a 3–3 draw, a fourth game had to be played, with Huracán winner with a score of 3–2, which relegated Lanús to Primera B.
Other important facts in club's history were the debuts of two notable players: Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1946 and Adolfo Pedernera in 1948.
During the decade of the 1950s Huracán came close to being relegated, but managed keep its place in the top division. Huracán defeated Tigre in 1950 and then beat Quilmes a year later. The most important achievement during those years was 3rd place in 1952, shared with Independiente.
In the decade of the 1960s Huracán did not have great campaigns, the club's best performance being 6th place in 1963. In 1967 a restructuring of the tournaments was carried out by the Football Association, creating the Metropolitano and Nacional championships. During the 1969 tournament, two historical players of the club, Miguel Brindisi and Carlos Babington played together for the first time.
The revolution of Menotti
In 1971 César Menotti was hired as coach by then president Luis Seijo. Menotti started a process that ended successfully in 1973, when Huracán won its second league title in club's history the 1973 Metropolitano championship. That squad is widely regarded as one of the best Argentine teams ever, with key players such as René Houseman, Carlos Babington, Miguel Brindisi, and Omar Larrosa.
The most frequent line-up of Huracán in 1973 was: Héctor Roganti, Nelson Chabay, Daniel Buglione, Alfio Basile, Jorge Carrascosa, Miguel Brindisi, Francisco Russo, Carlos Babington, René Houseman, Roque Avallay, and Omar Larrosa. The team finished with 46 points (four more than runners-up Boca Juniors) with 19 matches won and five loses.
With a team formed with most of the players that had won the title, Huracán reached the semifinals in the 1974 Copa Libertadores being later eliminated by Independiente (who would become champions) and Peñarol. In domestic competitions, Huracán was runner-up in the 1975 Metropolitano and 1976 Metropolitano. Some of the most notable players of that time were Osvaldo Ardiles and goalkeeper Héctor Baley, both of whom would win the 1978 World Cup playing for the Argentina national football team.
Relegations
The 1980s was not a good decade for the club. Huracán were relegated for the first time to the second division, Primera B Nacional in 1986. The team played four years there until Huracán won promotion to Primera in 1990, being coached by former player and idol Carlos Babington. Some of its most notable players were Antonio Mohamed and Fernando Quiroz.
Coached by former player Héctor Cúper, Huracán was 1994 Torneo Clausura runner-up after a great campaign during that season, losing in the last fixture when the Parque Patricios' team was soundly defeated by Independiente (who became champions) 4–0, in a match played in Estadio Libertadores de América.
In 1999 Huracán was relegated to B Nacional again, although the club would be promoted one season later, coached by Babington again. A new crisis due to internal and financial problems led to relegation in 2003. The club spent four seasons in the B Nacional until 2007, when the club promoted to Primera after defeating Godoy Cruz in playoffs with scores of 2–0 in Parque Patricios and 3–2 in Mendoza. Huracán was coached by Antonio Mohamed, who had won a promotion as player some years earlier.
2009 Clausura campaign
During the decade of the 2000s, Huracán was near to winning another title, more precisely in the 2009 Clausura, where the team, coached by Ángel Cappa, made a great campaign but lost the title at the hands of Vélez Sársfield in the last round of the tournament. Referee Gabriel Brazenas disallowed a goal scored by Eduardo Domínguez when the match was still 0–0.
Huracán finished the season placed 2nd with 38 points, the club's best position since the 1973 championship.
The second half of the 2009 season was a great disappointment for the club. Huracán finished near the bottom of the league in the following season and Cappa resigned as coach. After some poor campaigns, Miguel Brindisi was named coach by former player and manager Carlos Babington, who had become president. The results were not as good as expected and Brindisi was soon replaced by Roberto Pompei, who could not change the situation, and eventually Huracán were relegated to Nacional B in the 2010–11 season.
Return to success
In November 2014, after 41 years from its last official title, Huracán won the 2013–14 Copa Argentina when the team beat Rosario Central via a penalty shootout by 5–4 at the final, after regular time ended in a 0–0 draw. The squad had a great campaign finishing the tournament unbeaten with 6 games played, although most of its games were won via penalties. The line-up for the final was: Marcos Díaz; Erramuspe, Mancinelli, Domínguez, Arano, Villarruel; Vismara, Esponoza, Toranzo; G. Martínez, Abila.
The team returned to Argentina's Primera División league on 14 December 2014, after winning a one-game playoff against Atletico Tucuman, won 4–1. for the fifth place of Nacional's Group B.
On 25 April 2015, Huracan won the second domestic cup in just six months when they clinched the Supercopa Argentina after beating 2014 Torneo Final champions River Plate 1–0 at San Juan.

The All-Canadian Congress of Labour (ACCL) was a Canadian national labour confederation, which existed from 1926 to 1940.
It was founded in 1926 as a rival to the Trades and Labour Congress. It was headed by Aaron Mosher. It included remnants of the One Big Union and had over 40,000 members. The ACCL was opposed to American interference in the Canadian labour movement. In 1929, the communist unions left the ACCL and formed the Workers' Unity League. In 1940, the ACCL merged with Canadian sections of the Congress of Industrial Organizations to form the Canadian Congress of Labour.

Leptospermum brevipes, commonly known as the slender tea-tree, is a species of shrub or small tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. It has fibrous bark on the main stems, smooth bark on young stems, narrow elliptical to narrow egg-shaped leaves, white flowers and hemispherical fruit that is shed when mature.
Description
Leptospermum brevipes is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to high. The bark on its larger stems is rough but young stems have smooth bark that is shed in stringy strips and have a flange near the base of the petiole. The leaves are narrow elliptical to narrow egg-shaped, long, wide, hairy at first but become glabrous. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils and are in diameter on a pedicel long. The floral cup is hairy and about long. The sepals are triangular, silky hairy and about long. The petals are white, long and the stamens are about long. Flowering occurs from October to December and the fruit is a silky-hairy, hemispherical capsule in diameter with the sepals attached and that is shed when mature.
Taxonomy and naming
Leptospermum brevipes was first formally described in 1855 by Ferdinand von Mueller in their book Definitions of rare or hitherto undescribed Australian plants. The specific epithet (brevipes) is a Latin word meaning "short-footed".
Distribution and habitat
Slender tea-tree grows in woodland and shrubland, usually on rocky granite outcrops and near rocky streams. It occurs from the Granite Belt in south-eastern Queensland, mostly along the tablelands of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory to eastern Victoria.

The yellow-rumped marshbird (Pseudoleistes guirahuro) is a species of bird in the family Icteridae. It is a medium-sized bird found in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, where its natural habitats are dry savanna, swamps, and pastureland.
Description
The yellow-rumped marshbird is named for its yellow belly, flanks, thighs, and rump. Its head is blackish in color; its breast, back, and wings are blackish brown. The species exhibits slight size dimorphism, with males weighing on average 91.2 g and females weighing on average 81.9 g.
Distribution and habitat
The yellow-rumped marshbird is found in southeastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, northern Uruguay, and the Misiones and Corrientes provinces of northeastern Argentina. Its range in Brazil overlaps with that of the brown-and-yellow marshbird. It is most commonly found in shrubby marsh or moist grasslands and avoids treeless habitats.
Ecology
The yellow-rumped marshbird feeds on ground arthropods and small vertebrates. Marshbirds are gregarious and form flocks of 10-20 birds for most of the year. From September through November, single marshbird pairs can be observed, indicating the beginning of the breeding cycle. One individual will gather nest materials, inspect nest sites, and build the nest, while the other produces short songs. After eggs are laid, three to four adult marshbirds can be observed to guard the nest and bring food to chicks, indicating that yellow-rumped marshbirds are regular cooperative breeders.

Krembanan is a chocolate-banana candy bar in the shape of a banana. The Krembanan was first made in 1957, and its appearance today has not changed. It is made of one layer of gel and one layer of banana cream covered by chocolate. All Krembanan bars have the same appearance and all weigh 35g. The manufacturer still uses the original machine to pack these "chocolate with a bend" bars; the machine has been in use since 1957 and is the oldest machine in use by Nidar.

Pennsylvania held statewide municipal elections on November 3, 2009, to fill a number of judicial positions and to allow judicial retention votes. The necessary primary elections were held on May 19, 2009.
Justice of the Supreme Court
Voters were asked to fill a single vacancy on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The vacant seat had been occupied by Jane Cutler Greenspan, who had agreed as a condition of their interim appointment in 2008 not to seek a full term on the court. Vying for the seat in the general election were Republican Joan Orie Melvin of Allegheny County and Democrat Jack A. Panella of Northampton County, both of whom were then serving on the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. Orie Melvin won the seat with 53 percent of the vote, restoring the 4–3 Republican majority that had existed on the court prior to the 2007 state election. Panella raised $2.4 million for the campaign, compared to $734,000 for Orie Melvin. Low voter turnout, especially in Panella's native Philadelphia, played a key role in Orie Melvin's victory.
Judge of the Superior Court
Four seats on the Superior Court were up for grabs. On the ballot in the general election were four Republicans, four Democrats, and one Libertarian.
Republican candidate Judy Olson won the most votes, followed by fellow Republicans Sallie Mundy and Paula Ott. There was a four-way near tie for fourth place, with Democrat Anne E. Lazarus in the lead (with 11.5% of the vote) but closely trailed by Democrat Robert J. Colville (11.4%), Republican Temp Smith (11.4%), and Democrat Kevin Francis McCarthy (11.3%). The close results triggered an optional automatic recount. While candidates Colville and McCarthy opted out of the recount, Smith declined to do so, prompting Secretary of State Pedro Cortés to order a recount to begin on November 18—the first automatic statewide recount in Pennsylvania history. On December 1, the Pennsylvania Department of State announced that the recount had been completed, with the results essentially unchanged; Lazarus won the fourth seat. The cost of the recount was $542,000.
Judge of the Commonwealth Court
There were two open seats on the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The Candidates in the General Election were selected in the Pennsylvania Municipal Primary Election which was held May 19, 2009. The two leading Republican candidates in the Primary were Patricia A. McCullough (36.2%) and Kevin Brobson (35.9%), followed by Al Frioni (27.9%). The two leading Democratic candidates were Barbara Behrend Ernsberger (22.0%) and Linda Judson (21.1%) followed by Jimmy Lynn (15.3%) Michael Sherman (14.9%) Stephen Pollok (13.5%) and Daniel Brickmont (13.3%). The General Election was held on Tuesday November 3, 2009.
Judge of the Superior Court retention
Voters elected to retain Judge Kate Ford Elliott on the Superior Court.
Judge of the Commonwealth Court retention
Voters elected to retain Judge Dan Pellegrini on the Commonwealth Court.

Lic. Glovis Reyes Aglón is the current Mayor of the city of Nizao, Dominican Republic, elected on the municipal elections celebrated on May 16, 2010.
Early life and education
Glovis Reyes was born in Don Gregorio, the son of Agapito Reyes Encarnación (Apicito), a pharmacy owner in Santo Domingo originally from Juan Barón Palenque, San Cristóbal, and Miriam Aglón Nova, a grocery owner from Don Gregorio, in 1958.
Reyes studied at Liceo Francisco Gregorio Billini in Baní and at the Instituto Politécnico Loyola, in San Cristobal. After graduating from High school, Reyes went to Otto Rivera School to become a Radio announcer. They graduate from that school and worked as a radio host in San Cristobal, and at the same time started attending the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo Faculty of Humanities Department of Psychology, where they later graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology.
Political activism
Glovis Reyes came to Don Gregorio in 1984 to organize the Municipal Committee of the Bloque Institucional, which at that time was a group within the Dominican Revolutionary Party created to promote the presidential campaign of José Francisco Peña Gómez. An election was held to choose Bloque institutional Secretary General, which Glovis Reyes won over their opponent, Manuel Flores Familias, in June 1984. In 1985, Glovis Reyes won the election (convencion) and became president of the Dominican Revolutionary Party Municipal Committee. They held that position until their resignation in March 1990.
Public office
Reyes ran for a congressional nomination for Dominican Revolutionary Party, representing Peravia Province in 1986. They did not win the party primaries, but was a candidate for a council position in Bani City Government, where they served for four years (1986–1990). Reyes also ran for congress in 1990 to no avail. They started working as an orientation adviser at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo Barahona Campus. They run for congress again in 2002 and won that elections. As a member of congress, they served as a member of the International Relations Committee which helped them to travel all over the world. They run for re-election in 2006 and lost the elections.
In 2009, they were chosen as the candidate for mayor of Nizao on Dominican Revolutionary Party ticket. They won these elections with huge margin against the then Nizao Mayor Lic. Salvador Gómez, who was the candidate of the other two major parties: Social Christian Reformist Party and Dominican Liberation Party.

The Simbach am Inn–Pocking railway was a single-tracked branch line between Simbach am Inn and Pocking in the province of Lower Bavaria in southern Germany.
Preparations
Early planning
On 9 April 1894 the market town of Rotthalmünster and the communities to Simbach asked the head office of the Royal Bavarian State Railways for a branch line (Lokalbahn) to be built from Simbach am Inn to Rotthalmünster. Because that came to nothing, they pressed instead for a railway from Vilshofen to Simbach.
This proposal was presented by a delegation in Munich. Although this generated little enthusiasm with the head office, they did show a degree of interest in the original desire for a railway from Simbach to Rotthalmünster. So, on 3 December 1896 a new application for this line was submitted. On 30 January 1897 the Ministry for the Royal Household and Foreign Affairs announced their approval for the scoping of a Lokalbahn from Simbach am Inn to Rotthalmünster. In 1897 the state construction engineer, Ernst Arnold, started to plan a line to run alongside the River Inn to Rotthalmünster.
The intervention of Kößlarn
But at this point the market town of Kößlarn entered the scene. On 7 December 1897 Kößlarn's railway committee proposed a line from Simbach through the Lower Bavarian Hills via Wittibreut to Kößlarn and then from there to Rotthalmünster. The mayor, Johann Abtmaier, justified this on the grounds that otherwise Kößlarn would be isolated, a situation that would force them to oppose any project for a railway alongside the Inn.
The Royal Bavarian State Railways (K.Bay.Sts.B.) decided that only one railway could be built and that the line alongside the River Inn would be more promising than the one proposed by Kößlarn. This resulted in a protracted tug-of-war over the route. In 1899 Kößlarn sent in a list of the goods that would be handled by their proposed line and calculated that 61,260 tonnes of freight would be transported on it annually. On 6 May 1899, the undersecretary, Friedrich Krafft von Crailsheim, rejected this assessment of the data on the grounds that it was significantly overestimated. The Kößlarn railway was seen as less economical because it was about 3.7 kilometres longer and had 153 metres of additional height to overcome.
Undeterred, Kößlarn and Wittibreut sent a new petition to Munich on 27 October 1900 for the construction of a railway line to Kößlarn. The K.Bay.Sts.B.'s general manager, Gustav Ebermayer, ignored the letter, but let it be known that they were prepared to carry out a scoping exercise for a line from Rotthalmünster to Kößlarn on payment of 1,000 gold marks. Kößlarn transferred the money immediately.
Construction of the Simbach–Rotthalmünster–Kößlarn line
In April 1901 construction began in Rotthalmünster. Immediately, Pastor Franz Xaver Almer complained to the head office that the railway was being built too close to the vicarage and its grounds. The resulting exchange of correspondence and local meetings cause a further delay. In 1902 another deputation from Kößlarn was sent to Munich with a request for an extension of the line to Kößlarn.
On 19 May 1903 there was a decisive meeting in Rotthalmünster at which all those affected were present from the district officer (Bezirksamtsmann) to representatives of every rural district. It transpired that 195,000 marks was needed for the purchase of land, of which 15,000 marks could be found.
On 10 August 1904 the law for the 23.07 kilometre long Lokalbahn from Simbach via Tutting to Rotthalmünster came into force. Kößlarn had to wait anxiously until a further law was passed on 26 June 1908 for the construction of the 6.23 kilometre long remaining section to the town. On 29 October 1910 the railway from Simbach to Rotthalmünster was opened and, on 1 May 1911 the rest of the line to Kößlarn went into service as well.
Construction of the Tutting–Pocking line
Now the offensive began for the construction of a link line to Pocking. As early as 27 June 1901 a railway committee for a Simbach–Pocking Lokalbahn set out the necessity for a through link from Simbach to Passau. They pressed for a junction for the new line with the Passau–Neumarkt-Sankt Veit railway. In order to travel by rail from Simbach to Passau at that time the trains had to pass through Austrian territory for 84 kilometres, a journey that took five to six hours. By building a line from Tutting to Pocking it was argued that the distance could be reduced to 64 kilometres and the time taken to just three hours. There were also complaints that those participating in a pilgrimage from Passau to Altötting had to pay 2,000 marks for travelling on the Austrian Railway and had to put up with customs inspections as well.
On 28 July 1906 all the interested parties met in Pocking. A proposal from the Hartkirchen community to run the planned line via their village, was refused, because it would have meant the link being almost twenty kilometres long rather than eight. On 2 November 1912 the Tutting–Pocking line was approved and it went into service on 1 December 1914. It was 8.87 kilometres long.
Operations
Trains ran through from Simbach to Pocking and also worked the stub line from Tutting via Rotthalmünster to Kößlarn. In 1921 four pairs of trains ran daily from Simbach to Pocking, the journey time for the 28.4 kilometres being 105 minutes; which represented an average speed of 16 km/h. On the Tutting–Kößlarn railway three pairs of trains worked the line each day, taking 38 minutes to traverse the 9.8 kilometre long route. In the winter of 1953/54 Uerdingen railbuses appeared on both lines, reducing the journey time to 57 and 22 minutes respectively. At the time eight train pairs ran daily on each line.
Despite that operations were always unprofitable. On 2 October 1960 the Deutsche Bundesbahn closed down the passenger services between Tutting and Kößlarn. On 1 June 1969 passenger services between Pocking and Simbach and goods services between Simbach and Tutting were withdrawn. Goods traffic between Rotthalmünster and Kößlarn ceased on 1 January 1970. In February 1972 work began on dismantling the line.
Only the goods traffic between Pocking and Rotthalmünster was maintained until the closure of the Tutting–Rotthalmünster section on 1 January 1996. This left the Bundeswehr transport from the Rott Valley Barracks in Kirchham. The siding to the barracks was lifted prematurely and so loading was moved to the station at Tutting until the barracks finally closed in 2002. On 1 July 2003 the Tutting–Pocking railway was finally closed.
In 2007 the former trackbed was released from railway requirements by the Federal Railway Office in a process under § 23 of the General Railway Law and so its last formal link with the railways was ended. The only signs of the old railway today are two bridges and the roads that are named after the stations. On the trackbed of the Tutting–Pocking section a cycle path was laid in 2008.

Tylopilus alboater, called the black velvet bolete, by some, is a bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The species is found in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, and in eastern Asia, including China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. A mycorrhizal species, it grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground usually under deciduous trees, particularly oak, although it has been recorded from deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests.
The fruit bodies have a black to grayish-brown cap that measures up to in diameter. The caps of young specimens have a velvety texture and are covered with a whitish to gray powdery coating; this texture and coating is gradually lost as the mushroom matures, and the cap often develops cracks. The pores on the underside of the cap are small and pinkish. The stem is bluish purple to black, and measures up to long by thick. Both the pore surface and the whitish cap flesh will stain pink to reddish gray, and eventually turn black after being cut or injured. The mushroom is edible, and generally considered one of the best edible Tylopilus species.
Taxonomy and naming
The species was first described in 1822 as Boletus alboater by Lewis David de Schweinitz from specimens they collected in North Carolina. Elias Magnus Fries sanctioned this name in their 1821 Systema Mycologicum. The species was one of several Boletus species that Otto Kuntze transferred to Suillus in their 1898 Revisio Generum Plantarum. American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill transferred it to the genus Tylopilus in 1909. In 1931, French mycologist Jean-Edouard Gilbert transferred the species to their newly created genus Porphyrellus, but this name has since been subsumed into Tylopilus.
In 1875, Charles Horton Peck described Boletus nigrellus from specimens they collected in Sand Lake, New York. Murrill reduced this name to synonymy with T. alboater in 1916, and noted that Peck's description was made from young material obtained "before the white tubes had been colored by mature spores". Several later authorities have treated Peck's species as a synonym of Tylopilus alboater; this synonymy, however, is not indicated by either of the taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum or MycoBank.
The specific epithet alboater means "white and black". It is commonly known as the "black velvet bolete"; Murrill called it the "blackish bolete".
Description
The shape of the cap is initially convex before later becoming broadly convex to eventually flattened in maturity; the diameter of the cap is typically between . The cap surface is dry, with a velvet-like texture, although in age it can become rimose (developing a network of cracks and small crevices). The cap color is initially black to dark grayish brown; young specimens can have a whitish bloom (resembling a dusting of fine powder) on the surface. Fruit bodies, especially young specimens, tend to be free of maggots and other insect larvae. As the mushroom matures, the bloom disappears and the color fades to become grayish to grayish brown. The cap flesh is whitish, but after it is cut or injured, it will stain pink to reddish gray, and eventually turn black.
Spores are produced in basidia that are arranged in a vertically arranged layer of minute tubes on the underside of the cap that create a surface of pores. This surface is whitish when young before turning dull pink or flesh-colored in maturity. When bruised, the pore surface initially stains reddish and slowly turns black. The shape of the pores is angular to irregular, and they are small, with roughly two pores per millimeter. The tubes are deep, and usually sunken around the area of attachment to the stem. The stem is long by thick, and is equal in width throughout its length, slightly thicker towards the base, or somewhat thicker in the middle. It is the same color as the cap, or paler. The surface texture of the stem is usually smooth, although some specimens may be slightly reticulated near the top. The spore print can range from pinkish to a deep flesh color.
The spores are oval to ellipsoid in shape, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 7–11 by 3.5–5 μm. The basidia are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 15–24 by 6–7.5 μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the tube faces) are irregularly club-shaped, with dimensions of 20–36 by 7–10 μm, while cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are club-shaped, rare, occur singly, and measure 18–32 by 7–9 μm. Although rare, there are also caulocystidia (occurring on the stem) that are arranged in groups, and which measure individually 24–30 by 6–9 μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of T. alboater.
Tylopilus alboater is an edible mushroom with a pleasant odor and a mild taste. It is considered one of the best of the edible Tylopilus—a genus that is usually associated with bitter-tasting, unpalatable species. Frying slices of the mushroom brings out a "delicate, earthy, nutty flavor"; longer frying times make the cap "pleasantly crisp". The mushrooms can be used in mushroom dying.
Similar species
Some Tylopilus species have a superficial resemblance to T. alboater and might be confused with it, including T. atronicotianus, T. atratus, and T. griseocarneus. T. atratus produces smaller fruit bodies with caps up to in diameter, and its whitish flesh directly stains black without any intermediate reddish phase when injured. It is known from only from western New York state. The "false black velvet bolete", T. atronicotianus, has a brownish cap that lacks the velvety texture of T. alboater, and has stems that are minutely velvety and almost black near the base. T. griseocarneus, found in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains of North America, is readily distinguished from T. alboater by the strong orange to red discoloration that results when cutting or damaging the flesh of a fresh specimen. Furthermore, T. griseocarneus lacks the whitish bloom present on young caps of T. alboater, and typically has a more prominently reticulated stem. Specimens of T. alboater that are paler than usual can be confused with T. ferrugineus, but the latter has yellow cystidia when mounted in KOH, while the cystidia of the former are brownish yellow under similar conditions.
Distribution and habitat
Tylopilus alboater is a mycorrhizal species, and its fruit bodies grow on the ground solitarily, scattered, or in groups under deciduous trees, particularly oak. Fruiting occurs in deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. Its dark color makes it difficult to notice in the field.
In North America, the mushroom is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. The distribution ranges from Quebec in Canada, south to the New England states down to Florida, extending west to Missouri, Michigan, and Texas. It is also found in Mexico. In Asia, it has been recorded from China (Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan), Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand.

A bouillon cube (Canada and US), stock cube (Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and UK), or broth cube (Asia) is dehydrated broth or stock formed into a small cube about wide. It is typically made from dehydrated vegetables or meat stock, a small portion of fat, MSG, salt, and seasonings, shaped into a small cube. Vegetarian and vegan types are also made. Bouillon is also available in granular, powdered, liquid, and paste forms.
History
Dehydrated meat stock, in the form of tablets, was known in the 17th century to English food writer Anne Blencowe, who died in 1718, and elsewhere as early as 1735. Various French cooks in the early 19th century (Lefesse, Massué, and Martin) tried to patent bouillon cubes and tablets, but were turned down for lack of originality. Nicolas Appert also proposed such dehydrated bouillon in 1831.
Portable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glue. It is a cousin of the glace de viande of French cooking. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish. Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 Household Cyclopedia,
"exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes."
In the mid-19th century, German chemist Justus von Liebig developed meat extract, but it was more expensive than bouillon cubes.
The invention of the bouillon cube is also attributed to Auguste Escoffier, one of the most accomplished French chefs of their time, who also pioneered many other advances in food preservation, such as the canning of tomatoes and vegetables.
Industrially produced bouillon cubes were commercialized by Maggi in 1908, by Oxo in 1910, and by Knorr in 1912. By 1913, at least 10 brands were available, with salt contents of 59–72%.
Ingredients
The ingredients vary between manufacturers and may change from time to time. Typically, the ingredients consists of salt, hydrogenated fat, monosodium glutamate, flavor enhancers, and flavors.
Maggi bouillon cubes are manufactured from iodized salt, hydrogenated palm oil, wheat flour, flavor enhancers (monosodium glutamate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate), chicken fat, chicken meat, sugar, caramel, yeast extract, onion, spices (turmeric, white pepper, coriander), parsley.
Production process
Stock cubes are made by mixing already dry ingredients into a paste. The ingredients are usually mixed in a container (batch mixing), left to mature, and then shaped into the cube form. Alternatively, they can be mixed directly into an extruder.

Motta Navas (born 1966) is a psychopathic serial killer who operated in the city of Kollam, Kerala, India between June and August 2012. Pavement dwellers were bludgeoned to death while they slept. All the murders took place at night and were committed by using stones or hard, blunt objects.
Early murders
Navas had already been convicted twice for murder. In 1996 they were arrested on charges of murdering Rajasekaran at Mundakkal in Kollam and was jailed for four years. They were acquitted because there were no witnesses. In 2007 they were arrested again on charges of murdering one Shamir at Karikode in the city following which they were arrested and convicted.
Serial killings
A series of brutal murders in the city of Kollam and nearby areas rocked the city in June 2012. Pavement and hutment dwellers were bludgeoned to death while they slept. All the murders took place at night and were committed by using stones or hard, blunt objects. A drug addict, Navas used to sleep by 8 p.m. and wake up at midnight to roam the city, targeting victims.
The first murder was committed on 6 June night. The victim, aged about 65 years, was hit on the head with a huge stone whilst they were sleeping under the SP Office flyover which was under construction. The second murder was committed the very next night on the veranda of a shop. The victim, Appukuttan Achary, was bludgeoned in the nape of their neck, fatally damaging the spine. The third murder was on the night of 18 June, also under the SP Office flyover. Bondan Kumar, 65, was hit on the head with a stone. On 3 August, Thankappan, 55, a native of Sasthamcotta, was found dead inside a bus waiting shed. They were sleeping in the shed when Navas attacked. The fifth murder was committed on the night of 21 August at the veranda of the Municipal Building in Chinnakkada. Sudarsanan, 45, was hit on the head with a stone. Navas had attempted two more murders, but the victims escaped with injuries.
Arrest
Soon after the second murder, the police suspected Navas and took them into custody. Navas pretended to be mentally challenged and so the police got them admitted to a mental asylum in Thiruvananthapuram. Whilst there, however, psychiatrists found them mentally fit and they were discharged. They came back to Kollam and allegedly committed the other murders. Night patrol teams of the police had noticed Navas loitering in the city on those days, but on seeing the police party they feigned mental illness and was ignored by the police. After investigations which lasted about a fortnight a police team led by Kollam East Circle Inspector V. Sugathan, Sub Inspector G. Gopakumar, and senior civil police officer Prasanna Kumar arrested Navas from the Nehru Park area in the city on 2 November 2012.

Franko "Frenki" Simatović (; born 1 April 1950) is a Serbian former intelligence officer of Croatian descent and commander of the elite special forces police unit Special Operations Unit (JSO) from 1991 to 1998.
Simatović is, along with former head of the State Security Service (SDB) Jovica Stanišić being prosecuted for war crimes in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period from 1991-95, before the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). They were initially acquitted on 30 May 2013 by the ICTY for their role in the wars but the verdict was later overturned on 15 December 2015 after successful appeal by the prosecutors (ICTY Appeals Chamber). The retrial before the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT) commenced on 13 June 2017. On 30 June 2021, they were found guilty undercounts of murder, deportation, forcible transfer and persecution as crimes against humanity that occurred during the Bosanski Šamac ethnic cleansing, and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
Background
Simatović was born in Belgrade into a Croatian family. Their father Pero Simatović was born in Dubrovnik, their mother Neda (née Winter) in Bjelovar. Pero Simatović was a Yugoslav Partisan who after the war became a high-ranking officer in the Yugoslav Army, and was one of the founders of Partizan. Neda belonged to the influential family Winter in Bjelovar, and was the daughter of Franko Winter (whom Simatović is named after), the founder of a law firm in Bjelovar. The family has lived in Belgrade since after World War II.
Franko Simatović studied at the Higher Police School and University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences. Their mentor, colleague and personal friend was Jovica Stanišić. Both were recruited into the State Security Administration (UDBA) immediately after studies, where they quickly rose in rank. During Slobodan Milošević's rise to power, Simatović was the head of the department dealing with affairs of American agencies in Yugoslavia. Simatović kept an office at Stanišić's command center in the village of Magarcevac, Croatia and both men had assumed command of regional forces in western Bosnia. They also led the ‘Pauk' (‘Spider') operation in Cazinska Krajina, Bosnia between 1994 and 1995.
ICTY trial
Indictment and trial (2003–13)
After the assassination of Zoran Đinđić, Stanišić was arrested on 13 March 2003 during Operation Sabre by the Serbian Police and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 30 May 2003. The original indictment against them and Jovica Stanišić was created in May 2003, and was later amended several times. They pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Simatović was accused of committing atrocities against non-Serbs during the Yugoslav wars including persecution and murder. As part of Milan Martić's trial at the ICTY, Simatović was found to be part of a "joint criminal enterprise which aimed to create a Greater Serbia including parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
Acquittal and appeal (2013–17)
Simatović and Stanišić were acquitted of all charges on 30 May 2013.
However, their acquittal as well as that of Jovica Stanišić, had been overturned on 15 December 2015 by the appeals chamber, which vacated the initial verdict deemed faulty as it was based on an insistence that the men could only be guilty if they "specifically directed" the crimes. On 22 December 2015, Simatović and Stanišić were granted temporary release. Back in Serbia, the two had to report to a local police station in Belgrade every day and surrender their passports to the Ministry of Justice of Serbia. They and Stanišić were on provisional release from December 2015 to June 2017.
MICT retrial (2017–present)
A new trial began on 13 June 2017, and is being handled by the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT), which took over the ICTY's remaining cases as it closes in December 2017. In December 2017, they were granted a provisional release until 19 January 2018. In August 2018, only their co-defendant Stanišić was reported to still be on provisional release and they did not immediately file a motion for an extension of their provision release after their return to custody. Any provisional release granted to Simatović has also come with stricter conditions as well and has not faced objection from the prosecution. As of November 2019, Simatović was still in The Hague attending the trial, while Stanistic remained on provisional release. However, Simatovic was later granted provisional release from March 12, 2020 to August 13, 2020. After their provisional release ended, Simatović was returned to their UN-run detention unit and again appeared in person for an appeal hearing held at a Hague court on August 28, 2020.
On 30 June 2021, they and Stanišić were found guilty undercounts of murder, deportation, forcible transfer and persecution as crimes against humanity that occurred in Bosanski Šamac in April 1992, and sentenced to 12 years in prison, making it the first case of the Tribunal in which an official from Serbia was convicted for crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bennhausen is a municipality in the Donnersbergkreis district, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirchheimbolanden.
Geography
Bennhausen has an area of 1.49 km². It is situated in the North Palatine Uplands, at the foot of the Donnersberg, which lies about 3 km west of the village. The land to the west and north of the hilly landscape is mainly planted with orchards, and the forest almost reaches the outskirts of the village. The land to the south and east consists mainly of agricultural farmland.
The neighboring municipalities are Weitersweiler (south-east), Jakobsweiler (west), Dannenfels (north-west) and Bolanden (east).
History
Bennhausen was documented for the first time, in 1252, as Benninhusen. In 1376, the city belonged to the Palatinate. During the Thirty Years' War, Bennhausen was completely destroyed. In 1706, it was given to the Earls of Nassau-Weilburg. Since 1816, Bennhausen has belonged to the municipality of Dannenfels.
Administration
Politics
The local council in Bennhausen consists of six members, elected in a majority vote, and the honorary mayor as chairperson. The last local elections took place on 7 June 2009.
Coat of arms
The coat of arms is a "red and silver diagonally divided, top right six-spoked silver wheel, bottom left a red deer pierced by a red arrow". It was approved in 1976 by the government of the Neustadt district.
The Wheel of Mainz recalls that Bennhausen belongs to the diocese of Mainz. The doe is the attribute of Saint Giles, one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, to which an earlier chapel was dedicated.
Economy and infrastructures
As is typical of similar villages, the place was characterized, till the 1960s, by agriculture. Today, commuters dominate, in economic terms. Two new settlements were established around 1980 and 2005, respectively. In the original center, some houses have been renovated by both locals and newcomers. There are also former agricultural properties.
The former elementary school, operated until 1960, has been fully renovated and greatly expanded; it now serves as a community center for various purposes. Bennhausen has a volunteer fire department, including a Youth Fire Brigade. Community patrons organize cultural events, festivals and the fairs, which take place on the 3rd weekend of August.
The L 397 passes through the village. Approximately 3 km southeast, at the Göllheim exit, it connects with the A 63 (Kaiserslautern - Mainz). In the southwestern direction, Kaiserslautern is approximately 30 km. To the north, Mainz is about 50 km away. In Dreisen, 4 km away from Bennhausen, the railway line has been closed down and operates only on weekends during the summer months, through the Zellertal railway. The nearest regular railway station is in Kirchheimbolanden, with connection to Alzey and Mainz, as well as to Winnweiler, connecting there with Kaiserslautern and Bad Kreuznach.
Demographics
Bennhausen has a population of 156 (as of December 31, 2011).

Michael from the kindred Csák (; died after 1277) was a Hungarian nobleman and soldier in the 13th century, who served as ispán of Veszprém County in 1272. They actively participated in various military conflicts in the 1260s and 1270s.
Family
Michael was born into the Dobóc (or Orbova) branch of the gens (clan) Csák as the son of Peter. They had three brothers, Dominic, who pursued career in politics resulting the ascendance of their branch, Simon and possibly Beers. Michael had no known descendants.
Career
While Dominic entered court service and was involved in national governance, Michael excelled in a military career since the 1260s. Both of them belonged to the accompaniment of Duke Stephen, who governed Transylvania since 1260. When the tense relationship between Stephen and their father King Béla IV of Hungary sparked into a civil war at the turn of 1264 into 1265, Michael was actively involved in military operations. They were among the few dozen defenders in the siege of the fort of Feketehalom (today Codlea, Romania) during the war. Michael suffered a life-threatening injury in the siege, when Stephen led their remaining garrison out of the fort to fight the besiegers, while the duke's rescue army had arrived. Thereafter, Michael participated in the decisive Battle of Isaszeg in early March 1265. Despite the victory, Dominic and Michael turned against their lord Stephen and fled to the royal court of Béla IV in late 1266. The brothers were involved in lawsuit with the Vaja kindred over their acquired estates in Valkó and Syrmia counties. The paterfamilias Dominic reached an out-of-court settlement with their opponents with the consent of their brothers, Michael, Simon and Beers in 1267.
Michael's military career reached its peak in 1268, when the Serbian king Stefan Uroš I invaded the Duchy of Macsó, the southern province of the Kingdom of Hungary, taking advantage of the internal conflict between Béla IV and Stephen. Michael was part of the Hungarian reinforcements marched into the south in order to liberate the province, led by their distant relative Stephen Csák. During the battle, which resulted the decisive victory of the Hungarians, Michael bravely fought and captured two important Serbian barons: an unidentified son-in-law of King Stefan Uroš and a son of the monarch's treasurer in their full armor and with their horses in the sight of Duke Béla of Macsó. The duke's mother Duchess Anna of Macsó also testified their bravery in the royal court. Following the war, Michael agreed with the Serbs in a ransom of 800 marks to release the two captured lords. They received 300 marks in cash, while the remaining amount (500 marks = 3,000 Florentine florins) was covered by a gem reliquary cross (staurotheke), which allegedly contained pieces of wood from the True Cross upon which Jesus was crucified. King Béla IV and Queen Maria Laskarina intended to buy the relic from Michael, who thus requested landholdings from the royal couple, instead of an amount of money. Béla donated landed estates to them in Somogy County in April 1269, including Erdőcsokonya, Kisvid, Som, Kovácsi and Nyim. In addition, they were also granted some possessions in Fejér County. King Béla referred to Michael as their faithful "royal youth" () in the 1269 document.
Following the death of Béla IV in May 1270, Stephen V ascended the Hungarian throne without difficult. In order to eliminate threat from the Kingdom of Bohemia and to stabilize of the domestic political situation, the newly crowned king reconciled with the former partisans of their late father, including Dominic and Michael Csák. On 15 June 1270, in this spirit, Stephen V transcribed Béla's donation letter from the previous year (9 April 1269) to Michael, in which they confirmed them in the previous donation concerning Erdőcsokonya, but their diploma omit to mention Béla's other donations in Somogy County to Michael. In addition, the king extended the donation to Dominic and their descendants too. They also exempted Dominic, Michael and their descendants from the jurisdiction of the palatine and other barons, and placed them directly under the king's court or the judge royal. Both Dominic and Michael remained supporters of the king for the remaining part of their short reign. When Ottokar II of Bohemia invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, they fought against the Bohemians in the northern part of the county. Both of them were present in the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May 1271, when Stephen routed Ottokar's army. Michael was first styled as ispán of Veszprém County in June 1272. Because of Michael's advances military service, Dominic and Michael were granted Karos in Zala County in August 1272, shortly before Stephen's death. They still held the office of ispán of Veszprém County in November 1272, after King Ladislaus IV ascended the Hungarian throne.
During the turbulent years of the first phase of feudal anarchy (1272–1277), Michael was also a sufferer and exploiter of the chaotic period. During the attack of the rival baronial group in the winter of 1275, the Geregyes – Nicholas and Geregye – along with their relative Roland, son of Mark (all of them belonged to the Csáks' rivals) plundered and looted Michael's villages and estates, while their churches were invaded and robbed. A few months later, Dominic and Michael temporarily became disgraced due to their involvement in the attack and sack of the Diocese of Veszprém in the spring of 1276, led by their relative Peter Csák. According to Queen Elizabeth's charter from that year, both of them actively participated in the "horrible attack", therefore they confiscated the village Karos from them and handed over the possession to the bishopric of Veszprém as a compensation. During the Geregyes' attack in 1275, the asupervisorstioned diploma of Béla IV from 1269 was lost or destroyed (it survived only in a 1275 transcript), as a result Michael requested Ladislaus IV to confirm and transcribe their grandfather's former donations to them in Somogy and Fejér counties. Vice-chancellor Demetrius demonstrated the authenticity of Béla's previous donation, since Demetrius also bore the office and personally handed over the letter of donation to Michael at that time. Ladislaus IV confirmed the donations in July 1277. This is the last mention of Michael, they died sometime thereafter.

Jatindra Charan Guha (13 March 1892 – 2 January 1972), popularly known by their ring name Gobar Guha , was an Indian wrestler and practitioner of Pehlwani. They were the first Asian to win the World Light Heavyweight Championship in the United States in 1921.
Early life
Gobar came from a family of wrestlers. The Goho family had been known for pioneering, promoting and popularising the art of Pehlwani and physical culture in Bengal, for generations. Their great-grandfather had set up an akhara at Masjidbari Street. Their forebears included the legendary Ambu babu, and Khetu babu, who tutored Swami Vivekananda in the finer points of wrestling. Their father Ram Charan too was well-versed in the art. Gobar was born to Ram Charan in 1892 in Kolkata. They began their initial training under the guidance of their grandfather Ambika Charan Guha. They also took lessons from their uncle Khetra Charan Goho and father Ram Charan Goho. They began rigorous training under famous Indian wrestlers like Kholsa Chaubey and Rahmani Pehlwan, who were employed by the Goho family. When Gobar reached adulthood they stood at six feet and one inch and weighed around 290 pounds. Their expanded chest measured 48 inches. In the meanwhile they also passed the Entrance examination from Vidyasagar school in 1910. They also received training in Hindustani classical music from Kukuv Khan and used to attend the musical soirees of Narendranath Basu.
Career
Gobar embarked on a professional career in wrestling in 1910 at the age of eighteen. They debuted against Navrang Singh, the court wrestler of the Maharaja of Tripura, but they didn't take any money. In 1910, the John Bull Society of London organised a world wrestling championship bout to which wrestlers from all over the world including Gobar Goho and junior Gama of India were invited. In their first tour of Europe, Gobar fought bouts in Italy, Switzerland and England. Gobar went on a second tour of Europe in 1912 and returned home in 1915. During the trip they met Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight boxing champion at the wrestling tournament in Paris. Next they defeated Campbell, the highest-ranked wrestler of Scotland. Their next bout was against Scottish strongman and wrestler Jimmy Esson of Aberdeen, who has been described by the great strongman and wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt as 'the Scotch Giant'. Esson was at the receiving end throughout the fight and in the end resorted to illegal boxing punches. Gobar remained undeterred and duly wrestled the 'giant' on to the ground. After the War, Gobar went on a third tour of Europe and the United States from 1920 to 1926. During this tour, they fought the bout of their lifetime, when they disposed of the then World Light Heavyweight Champion and catch wrestler Ad Santel on 30 August 1921 at the Coliseum in San Francisco. They became the first Asian to win a World Professional Wrestling Championship in the United States. In their next bout they were pitted against the famous Ed 'Strangler' Lewis, considered by many to be the greatest ever professional wrestler. Lewis first tried their famous headlock on Gobar but to little effect. After a few rounds, Lewis managed to floor Gobar once, but the latter soon returned the compliment. Both fighters had registered two falls each, when Lewis resorted to foul play by hitting Gobar with a boxer's punch. When the referee overlooked this offence, Gobar turned to the judges to remonstrate, but at this moment, Lewis floored Gobar with a resounding thump, causing them to hit their head on the boards and lose consciousness. In 1929, Gobar fought another memorable fight against the younger Gama at Park Circus, Kolkata in a bout that has since passed into the folklore of Indian wrestling. After a stirring fight which showcased all the moves of Indian wrestling, the older Gobar finally lost on a technicality. The akhara that was established by their ancestors at Masjidbari Street was reincarnated by Gobar Goho at Goabagan in 1936. Gobar Goho retired from professional wrestling in 1944.
Legacy
Gobar Goho developed their own style of wrestling which took Indian wrestling into newer heights. Their style included their own wrestling holds like , , , , , pat, and which later became a part and parcel of Indian wrestling. They were famous for their vicious chops known as . Their achievements and success inspired Bengali Hindus to take up wrestling as a career which was seen as the traditional bastion of Muslims. Not only wrestlers but the famous body builders like Manohar Aich and Monotosh Roy were inspired by their successes. Their own disciples included their son Manik and their students Banamali Ghosh, Jyotish Charan Ghosh and Biswanath Dutta. Their followers observed their birth centenary in 1992. Goabagan Street in North Kolkata has been named Gobar Goho Sarani in their honour. Their statue was installed and unveiled at the Azad Hind Bagh in 1996 by the then Governor of West Bengal, Late Raghunath Reddy. On the current day their akhara Gobar Goho's Gymnasium runs firmly at 19/D/H/7, Gobar Goho Sarani, Kolkata-700006. The nearest prominent landmark is the Scottish Church College.

Lauhala, lau meaning "leaf" in the Hawaiian language, refers to the leaves of the hala tree (Pandanus tectorius).
Uses
The hala tree is of great cultural, health and economic importance in many Pacific Islands. The fruit of the tree is used as a food source in many Pacific Islands. The fruits are often consumed fresh or as a preserved food while the trunks of P. tectorius can be used as building material, and leaves for thatching. Though many parts of the hala tree are utilized, in Hawaii the most common use of Hala is the leaves.
Hawaiians distinguish five kinds of the hala tree according to the colour and size of the fruits:
hala ula (orange red)
hala lihilihi ula (red tip, becoming yellow to the centre)
hala īkoi (bright orange only at the tip)
hala melemele (yellow)
hala pia (not quite white, small fruit)
Weaving
Many Pacific cultures weave, plait, or braid the leaves of the P. tectorius to create useful items such as baskets, mats and hats. Though it is a long and arduous process to prepare the leaves for weaving, the final products are works of art with a pleasing earthy feel.
Remains of lauhala from burial caves in Hawaii show almost the same patterns as more recent woven objects, therefore the tradition of this craft seems to be very old. The district of Puna on the Island of Hawaiʻi was known for the abundance of hala.
During the Hawaiian Renaissance the lauhala weaving became popular again, and nowadays also non traditional items.
Types of Lauhala
[[File:Hīnano - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Hīnano: the rare male flower of hala (Pandanus tectorius)]]
The favored lauhala for weaving was called "lauhala kilipaki". The leaves of this Pandanus sp. were exceptionally soft and durable. They were highly prized for their beauty in color and the ease with which they could be plaited. Special sleeping mats were created out of the "Hīnano", male flower, of the hala tree. The light colored bracts were very soft and pliable and made very finely woven mats reserved for the chiefs (moena hīnano' or ʻahu hīnano''). They were especially prized because of their scarcity. Male plants are much less common in the wild than female, and they only make a few flowers per season. The bracts are also very short, about long and wide, with only about two thirds of the bract actually usable for weaving.

My Lady's Garter is a lost 1920 American silent mystery film directed by Maurice Tourneur and starring Wyndham Standing, Sylvia Breamer and Holmes Herbert. It was based on the 1912 novel of the same name by Jacques Futrelle, a writer who perished with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.
Plot
As described in a film magazine, a jeweled garter with an interesting history disappears under mysterious circumstances from the British Museum. The Hawk, a criminal who has never been apprehended even though they obligingly leaf many clues for the police to follow, is suspected. Helen Hamilton (Breamer), daughter of a wealthy American, loses their jewels after throwing them out of a window at Keats Gaunt (Craig), a poet they imagine they are in love with. A tiff with Gaunt follows and they dive into the sea, being rescued by a strange gentleman in a yacht who gives their name as Bruce Calhoun (Standing). English detectives suspect them of the robbery and watch them closely. They go to Helen's home and becomes acquainted with their family, but their mysterious actions raise doubts in the minds of all save Helen, who now loves him. Not even to her, however, will they admit their part in the mysterious proceedings that are occurring continuously until, by a master stroke, they catch the criminal, a rival for Helen's affections, and then reveals that they are an American secret service man and worthy of them love.

Henri Claude Fertet (27 October 1926 – 26 September 1943) was a French schoolboy and resistance fighter who was executed by the German occupying forces during World War II. They were posthumously awarded several national honours.  They are known for the letter they wrote to their parents on the morning of their execution, and they have become one of those who symbolise the French Resistance.
Early life and background
Fertet was born on 27 October 1926 in Seloncourt, Doubs, France, to primary schoolteachers (French: ). Their father too was named Henri; the sources do not record their mother's name. They had a brother, Pierre, who was three years younger. Their first schooling was at Seloncourt, where their parents worked. In 1937, the family moved to Velotte in Besançon, where the younger Henri attended the Lycée Victor-Hugo de Besançon. They were determined, lively, intelligent, and affectionate; they were passionate about archaeology and history.
Career
During the school summer holidays of 1942 while World War II was ongoing, they joined a Resistance group in Larnod (near Besançon) led by Marcel Simon, a 22-year-old farmer. In February 1943, that group (which had about thirty members, Fertet being the youngest) integrated itself into the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) under the name of .
Groupe Guy Mocquet mounted thirty-one known operations between November 1942 and July 1943. Fertet took part in three of them: on 16 April 1943, a night attack on an explosives depot at ; on 7 May, the destruction of a high-tension electricity pylon near Châteaufarine; and on 12 June, an attack by them and Marcel Reddet on a German customs officer to steal their weapon, uniform, and papers. Fertet shot and fatally wounded the officer, but the unexpected arrival of a motorcyclist meant that Fertet and Reddet failed to seize the documents.
Capture
Groupe Guy Mocquet was then actively hunted down. Several members were arrested in June. In the early hours of the night of 2–3 July, Fertet was arrested at their family home at the Lycée, taken before the Feldkommandantur (a German military court), committed to in Doubs, held in solitary confinement, and tortured.
On 15 September, twenty-three prisoners from three Resistance groups were brought before Feldkommandantur 560 to answer for crimes of which they were accused. The trial lasted four days. Despite the able advocacy of their lawyers, Paul Koch and Fernand Mouquin, seventeen of them were sentenced to death on 18 September. Simon and Reddet were among them; Fertet was the youngest. Under German law, no-one under the age of 18 could be sentenced to death barring exceptional circumstances. The court ruled that the cases of Fertet (age 16) and Reddet (age 17) were exceptional. The lawyers filed legal appeals; Henry Soum, the préfet of Doubs, , the Archbishop of Besançon, and the Swiss consul pleaded for general mercy. The sentence of one of the condemned, André Montavon, a 24-year-old Swiss national, was commuted to a term of imprisonment.
Execution and burial
At around dawn on Sunday, 26 September, the sixteen condemned men were told that their appeals had been rejected. They were provided with writing materials and given the opportunity to compose a last letter. They were taken to the Citadel of Besançon and, between 7:36 and 8:25 AM, shot in batches of four. The German officer who commanded the execution party reported that they had all refused blindfolds and died bravely, shouting "Vive la France!"
Eight of the sixteen, including Fertet, were buried in , Besançon. In defiance of German orders, local people covered their graves, identified only by numbers, with flowers. After the war, Fertet's body was exhumed and cremated; their ashes and those of their father, who had died in the meantime, were scattered at Sermoyer, Ain.
Fertet's farewell letter
The original of Fertet's farewell letter has not survived. However, it was soon copied and circulated clandestinely. On 9 December 1943, French journalist (and postwar politician) Maurice Schumann broadcast it on BBC radio from London. On 5 June 2019, French president Emmanuel Macron read extracts from it aloud, in French, at a 75th-anniversary commemoration of the Normandy landings, in Portsmouth, England, one of the embarcation ports.
In this English translation, the passages which Macron read out are in plain type, and the remainder are in italics.
Posthumous recognition
After the Liberation of France, Fertet was honoured with the distinctions of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur, Compagnon de la Libération (presented in 1947 to Fertet's father by de Gaulle in person), Croix de Guerre 1939–1945, Croix du combattant volontaire de la Résistance, , Médaille de la Résistance française, and the rank of aspirant ('officer candidate') in the French Forces of the Interior.
The following are named in their memory: Rue Henri Fertet, Besançon, a street; Collège Henri Fertet, Sancey, a middle school; Lycée des Métiers Henri Fertet, Gray, a technical college; and a tram route in Besançon.
Fertet's parents were anticlerical; that is, they opposed the influence of priests and of the Church in secular affairs. Fertet, however, was a devout Catholic, as were many of Groupe Guy Mocquet. It is paradoxical that they have become a sort of Republican saint.
Epilogue
On 26 or 27 November 1980, in the Forest of Chailluz near Besançon, Fertet's brother Pierre, a 51-year-old instituteur, and their octogenarian mother gassed themselves to death with the exhaust fumes of their car. Pierre had been much affected by their brother's death, and had venerated him, to the point of obsession. Pierre had refused to allow publication of Henri's letter without their express permission while they lived.
In 2013, Pierre's daughter, Myriam Fertet-Boudriot, Henri's last living relative, donated a collection of memorabilia to the Musée de la Résistance et de la Déportation in the Citadel of Besançon. It included some of Henri's drawings, a handkerchief stained with their blood (possibly as a result of their maltreatment in prison), and a tall figurine of the Virgin Mary which they had fashioned out of breadcrumbs, and before which they had prayed, during their imprisonment.

Fracstein Castle is a castle in the municipality of Seewis im Prättigau of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
The castle was probably built in the 11th or 12th century, perhaps for the Lords of Aspermont. Its location above a narrow part of the Prättigau valley means it was built to control and collect tolls from trade through the valley. The castle was extensively rebuilt in the 13th century and first appears in historical records in 1338. In that year the brothers Eberhardt and Ulrich von Aspermont, who had inherited the castle from their father, sold Fracstein to Count Friedrich V von Toggenburg. Friedrich then appointed Ulrich von Matsch as their vogt over the castle and surrounding lands. A few years later, in 1344, the Matsch and Toggenburg families divided their lands in the Prättigau, however Fracstein was specifically left as a shared castle. In 1436 the last Toggenburg Count, Frederick VII died and the castle was fully inherited by the Matsch family. They sold it to the Habsburgs in 1466. Soon thereafter the Habsburgs abandoned the castle and by 1570 it was a ruin. The castle church of St. Aper, located below and east of the castle, remained in use until about 1530.
During the Bündner Wirren the castle site was once again occupied. In 1621 the Austrians built a barricade near the old toll station and garrisoned the castle with a small force in the following year. Soon thereafter they were forced to abandon Fracstein by anti-Habsburg rebels. In October 1624 Prättigau forces briefly garrisoned the castle. In 1649 the villages of the Prättigau bought their freedom from the Habsburgs and Fracstein became part of Schiers. The communities agreed to pay for the upkeep of the road through the valley and the castle's bridge over the Landquart River, but allowed the castle to remain a ruin.
During the 1799 French invasion of Graubünden the Prättigau militia attempted to defend the narrow point in the valley at Fracstein, but were quickly forced to retreat. During the 19th century, the fortifications on the valley floor were mostly destroyed to provide space and building material for a railroad and a road through the valley.
During a renovation project in the main tower, a number of carvings from around 1300 were discovered. They included coats of arms of many of the noble families in the valley, castles topped with wooden structures, palisades and other designs.
Castle site
The castle is built into an overhang on a cliff on the north side of narrow point in the valley and the Landquart River. In addition to the castle, Fracstein included a rectory and the church of St. Aper east of the castle along the cliff and a tower and toll station along the river, with a wall that stretched from the cliff to the river across the valley.
Only the palas of the castle still remains. It is about long and three stories tall. The main entrance was into the second story on the east wall. Living quarters were on the third floor and the space was divided into two rooms by a wooden partition. These rooms had large windows on the valley side. Some of the medieval plaster is still visible on the third floor including a number of carvings from around 1300. The castle was supplied with water through wooden pipes from the top of the cliff.
About east of the castle stood the rectory. Today only one wall of the three story building is still standing. About east of the rectory is the site of the church. However, today no trace of the building remains.
The wall or Letzi stretches from the south-east corner of the castle to the river. The gate on the valley road was a pointed arch and had a gate house that was about . The gate and gatehouse along with much of the wall were demolished during construction of the railroad and new road along the valley floor.
The castle's name
Several different root words have been suggested for the name Fracstein. It might have come from fractus meaning broken. Another theory comes from the castle being called Fragestein in 1338 and Fragstein later. If that was the original name, then the root word might have been fragen (questions) or aufragen (to stand up).

Swallow was engaged in East Africa in the expedition against Fumo Amari, who was the Sultan of Wituland (in modern day Kenya). The expedition resulted in the capture of Pumwani and Jongeni, between 7 and 13 August 1893.
The Ashantee Medal was awarded to those who were employed on them together with the clasp "Witu 1893".
Swallow was commissioned by commander Edward Fitzmaurice Inglefield in 1899 to serve on the South America Station. They were in Montevideo in late February 1900, and visited the Falkland Islands the following month.
Fate
Swallow was sold to McCausland & Sons in 1904.

Yanuv (, lit. [He] will Come Forth) is a moshav in central Israel. Located in the Sharon plain near Netanya and Tulkarm, it falls under the jurisdiction of Lev HaSharon Regional Council. In it had a population of .
History
The village was founded on 21 March 1950 by a kvutza of immigrants from Tunisia on land which had been owned by a Nabulsi effendi prior to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.
Its name was taken from Proverbs 10:31: "From the mouth of the just will come forth wisdom".
Part of the village's homes were built with Norwegian funds, following the Hurum air disaster, in which over two dozen Jewish children on their way to Israel died. The sole survivor of the disaster settled in Yanuv, as did some of the families of victims that later immigrated to Israel. A memorial was later created, funded by the friendship association Friends of Israel in the Norwegian Labour Movement (Norwegian: Venner av Israel i Norsk Arbeiderbevegelse).

Modra (, , Latin: Modur) is a city and municipality in the Bratislava Region in Slovakia. It has a population of 9,042 as of 2018. It nestles in the foothills of the Malé Karpaty (Little Carpathian mountains) and is an excellent centre of hiking.
Modra is famous for its pottery industry. Its blue-and-white porcelain is famous throughout Slovakia.
It is also known as one of the most important viticulture centres in the Little Carpathians region.
Besides the main town, there are also other adjacent settlements incorporated in the municipality: former vassalage viticulture village Kráľová and two recreational hamlets of Harmónia and Piesok (also known as Zochova Chata), both located in the woods of Little Carpathians mountains.
Etymology
Most experts agree that the name is connected to (blue). The name probably originates from another historic geographic name in the neighbourhood, e.g. Modrá hora (Blue Mountain). According to a less probable hypothesis, the name comes from (a bird).
History
The first traces of habitation go back into the 3rd millennium BCE and the first permanent habitation comes from the time of Great Moravia, when the Slavs were living there. The first mention about Modra was in 1158 in a document of the Géza II of Hungary, when it belonged to the bishop of Nitra. After the Mongol invasion of 1241 the settlement was reconstructed by the German colonists. The first mention about vineyards goes back to 1321. The settlement received its town privileges in 1361 and became a free royal town in 1607. The town fortifications with three gates were constructed in 1610–1647. Since the 17th century it was one of the leading craft centres in present-day Slovakia. The ceramic industry and majolica production started in the 19th century and in 1883 a school of ceramics was established, where through the skillfulness of Habaners the so-called Slovak ceramics were created. The railway track from Bratislava to Trnava bypassed the town in the 1840s, as the local magistrate refused to allow construction of the railway.

A chase ensued and after six hours Speedwell captured Les Amis, armed with two brass 6-pounder guns and two swivels, and manned by 18 men. Les Amis was four days out of Granville and had not taken anything. Les Amis was very small, with a burthen of 12 tons (bm).
Three days later, Speedwell captured another French privateer in the same area, after a five hour chase. The privateer was Telemachus, of six brass 6-pounder guns and six swivels, with a crew of 35 men. Tomlinson put a prize crew aboard them and sent them into Plymouth. Télémaque was a little larger with a burthen of 39 tons (bm).
A Speedwell, either the hired lugger or the cutter , next appears as a participant in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland (27 August – 19 November 1799). On 24 September Admiral Andrew Mitchell reported that they detached Captain Boorder, in , with Speedwell, to scour the Coast from Steveren to Lemmer.
Subsequently, both Speedwells were among the vessels that shared in the proceeds of the Vlieter Incident on 28 August 1799, when the Dutch fleet, with 632 guns and 3700 men, surrendered to Admiral Mitchell, without a shot being fired.
December 1799 gave Speedwell their last two captures. Speedwell was in company with the hired lugger Valiant, under the command of Lieutenant Arthur Maxwell. On the 5th, they chased a French lugger privateer for six hours before they finally captured them some five leagues NW of Guernsey. The privateer was Heureuse Esperance, of Saint Malo, armed with fourteen 3-pounder guns, but with a crew of only 24 men, having placed a number of men aboard the four prizes they had captured before Speedwell and Valiant ended their cruise. Heureuse Esperance had thrown eight guns overboard during the chase. Heureuse Espereance was a small vessel with a burthen of 49 tons (bm).
The next day, Speedwell and Valiant chased another privateer brig for nine hours (the last hour and ten minutes being a running fight). The British vessels forced the privateer to strike some two miles north of the Swin (sic) Islands. The privateer was Heureux Speculateur, of Granville. They were armed with fourteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 58 men under the command of Citizen Louis Joseph Quoniam. They had been cruising for four days but had not taken anything. In the exchange of fire the privateer had had one man killed and seven wounded; there were no British casualties. Tomlinson described Heureux Speculateur as "a remarkably fast Sailer [that] has done a great deal of Mischief to the English Trade."
In early April 1800, "the Speedwell Cutter" brought into Yarmouth Fancy de Jersey, which they had recaptured off Goree. Fancy had been sailing from Guernsey to Leith when a French privateer lugger captured them
In mid-December, "the Speedwell Cutter" towed Recovery into Falmouth. Recovery had no one on board when Speedwell found them at sea. Recovery, Paine, master, had been sailing from Emsworth to Waterford when a French privateer had plundered them
On 31 December, Speedwell sailed for the Straits of Gibraltar with despatches. In the Gut of Gibraltar Speedwell encountered Spanish gunboats on 10 February. They were able to repel them though the engagement left Speedwell "much shattered", and with two men wounded.
Speedwell arrived back in Britain, at Plymouth, on 23 April, from Rhodes. Tomlinson landed with their despatches at Mount's Bay and took them to London overland. On the way back from Rhodes Speedwell had stopped at Mahón. There they took on board as a passenger Lieutenant Robert Jump, who had been commander of until 10 February when they encountered a French squadron under the command of Admiral Ganteume Ganteaume, which captured them (Jump underwent a court martial on 10 May aboard for the loss of their vessel and was acquitted.) On 29 April Speedwell landed 10,000 letters from Egypt, Malta, and Mahon, after the Officers of Health had properly fumigated them.

The Apostles from the Agony in the Garden sculpture (1500-1510) are a fragment of a multi-figure sculpture of the Agony in the Garden of unknown origin. The statues were found at the town sawmill in Cheb and transferred to the Municipal Museum. They are now on display in the permanent exhibition of Cheb sculpture at the Gallery of Fine Arts in Cheb.
Sculptures
St John the Evangelist
The statue is made of lime wood 73 × 66 × 24 cm in high relief, the fingers on the right hand and foot and part of the base are damaged.
St John the Evangelist is sitting cross-legged, leaning on a stylized rock in their sleep. The left hand is elbowed against the rock and holds a book, the right hand rests on the knee.
St Peter
A lime wood statue 73 × 40 × 23.5 cm in high relief, the left hand (with sword?) and part of the legs are missing after the statue was cut behind the left shoulder.
St Peter is depicted half reclining on their side. Their right hand, which supports their head, is resting with their elbow on a rock. In type, the statue corresponds to the West Bohemian carving tradition.
Description and classification
Both statues have preserved the original polychromy on a fabric base. They were restored by K. Stádník (1972, 1986) and J. Živný (1994).
In the carving, the layout of the body volumes and the representation of the perspective abbreviation are mastered. The concept of drapery, which combines long lines of folds with deep depressions, places the creation of the sculptures in the first decade of the 16th century. According to Ševčíková, who places the creation of the sculptures in the late 1590s, this is the oldest and most valuable work of the local Cheb carving workshop. The effort to separate the upper mantle from the body core and the contrast of the rounded shape with the drapery has its clear logic. The drapery ceases to be a dominant element, is in balance with the figure and has a simple, smoothly soft and clear form. This simplicity also emanates from the heads of the apostles. It is an expression of deep understanding and retains the immediacy of emotional experience. The high quality of the work is due to the concentration on the human essence of the subject, for which they have found an appropriate mode of rendering.
The Cheb statue of St. John with crossed legs is close in its composition to the depiction of this subject from the Church of St. Michael in Vienna or the monastery church in Reichenau. The type of face with sharply cut features or wig-like curled hair is also different from other works preserved in the Cheb region, and parallels should be sought in Saxony, which also maintained contacts with the artistic centres in Franconia. The Franconian carving tradition combined with advanced features of Saxon sculpture is represented, for example, by St. John the Evangelist from Černotín.
In the late Middle Ages, the sculptural treatment of the Agony in the Garden was very popular. The surviving complete sculptures of the Agony in the Garden include figures of the kneeling Christ and the Apostle St. James, or an angel with a cup of bitterness. Late Gothic stone sculptures of the Agony in the Garden are in the Church of St. Moritz in Olomouc, the Church of St. James in Jihlava and Modřice near Brno. The existence of sculptures in Bohemia is documented from the church of St. Bartholomew in Pilsen (1468), in Bezdružice and in the church of St. George in Horní Slavkov (destroyed after 1977).

Biography
Schembri Orland obtained a doctorate of laws in 1981, and a magister juris in European Law in 1996, both from the University of Malta.
From 1988 to 1990 they served as elected member to the Executive Board of the International Council of Women (ICW).
They took part from 1991 to 1993 in drafting legislative and constitutional reforms to eliminate gender-based discrimination from the laws of Malta in view of the country's accession to the CEDAW convention.
They also held positions with the European Council of Women, Malta's National Consultative Committee on Bioethics, as well as the San Blas Drug Rehabilitation Centre set up by Caritas (Malta).
Appointed Judge in 2012 by Malta's prime minister Lawrence Gonzi, they presided over the Civil Court in regards of matter of fundamental human rights as well as of probate, minority, interdiction and incapacitation, guardianships, trusts, foundations and cross border successions.
Justice Schembri Orland was the presiding judge in a number of Maltese landmark cases, such as in X vs Attorney General and Commissioner of Police in which they ruled that Malta breached the positive obligations under Art. 3 ECHR & Art. 36 of the Constitution (inhuman or degrading treatment) and Art. 8 ECHR (right to family and private life) due to the systematic failures in the procedures adopted by the police investigating and prosecuting incidences of domestic violence. In Marie Therese Cuschieri vs Attorney General, Malta's Constitutional Court, also presided by Schembri Orland, ruled that legal requirement dictating that women need to give details on their marital status in deeds of property sales was deemed to be discriminatory and unconstitutional.
In July 2019 Schembri Orland ruled that the right to freedom of expression of the Caruana Galizia family were being breached by the governmental removal of banners in private spaces.
In September 2019 they were sworn in as Malta's judge at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the first woman to hold such position.

Leatherbag was a rock band from Austin, Texas formed in 2005 by songwriter Randy Reynolds after moving from Houston. The band's name comes from a passage in the James Joyce novel, Finnegans Wake.
The Austin Chronicle'''s critic wrote, in reviewing the album Nowhere Left to Run, "There's no denying Leatherbag's talent". In discussing the band's album Love and Harm, NPR critic David Brown described the sound as "a frenetic garage-rock charge reined in by melodies that early Wilco would be proud to call its own".
In August 2010 the band edited their own Wikipedia page.
The band performed at The 2009 Austin City Limits Music Festival. They were showcased on the web series, ACL presents Satellite Sets and were also an official performer at SXSW 2010. After much deliberation, Leatherbag changed names to 'No Future' following a short tour of the South in late March 2012.

Mr. Doodle Kicks Off is a 1938 American comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins and written by Bert Granet. The film stars Joe Penner, June Travis, Richard Lane, Ben Alexander and Billy Gilbert. The film was released on October 7, 1938, by RKO Pictures.
Plot
Ellory Bugs has offered a huge donation to their old alma mater, Taylor Tech, which is to be paid only if their son, Jimmie "Doodle" Bugs, becomes a football hero. But "Doodle" tips the scales at 143 pounds and is more interested in the band than the football team. Janice Martin, daughter of the college president, is the great thing in "Doodle's" life, but they despise them and has eyes only for Mickey Wells, the school football star. "Doodle" is consoled by Professor Minorous, of the Greek Mythology department who tells them that the gods will solve all of their problems, and starts right in to make communications with these worthies by means of countless and meaningless blackboard equations.

Mak Man Kee Noodle Shop (), on Kowloon peninsula is a traditional Guangdong restaurant specialising in wonton noodle. It is located in Parkes Street, near Jordan MTR station in Hong Kong. It is considered a "must-stop spot" for the wonton noodle by The Essential Kowloon, and was awarded a star in the Michelin Guide in 2017.
The business was founded in 1957 as a dai pai dong. It has since moved indoors, and celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 2007.
Its recipe for the Cantonese noodles, hand-made using just flour and eggs (including duck eggs), is traditional, and has remained unchanged since the business was founded by the father of the current owner. The soup base is aimed to be tasty, without excessively drowning out the taste of the wonton noodles, and no monosodium glutamate is used.
The "wonton noodle" is synonymous with wonton and noodles served in piping hot bouillon. However, the restaurant's menu includes combinations of noodles' accompaniments in addition to or instead of the traditional wonton, and which may be served in a bouillon, or dry ().
A bowl of wonton noodles costs HK$21 as at June 2007, and aficionados are willing to travel some considerable distance to dine in relatively packed and spartan premises, and will often queue up outside in preference to nearby restaurants serving similar fare at about $10 a bowl. The restaurant received its Michelin Star in 2017.

Wan Qingliang (; Cantonese: Maan Hing Loeng, born February 12, 1964) is a former Chinese politician from Guangdong province. They served as the Mayor of Guangzhou, one of China's most populous cities, from 2010 to 2011, and was then promoted to Communist Party Secretary, the top official of the city. In June 2014, the Communist Party's anti-corruption agency announced that Wan was held for investigation. Wan was expelled from Chinese Communist Party on October 9, 2014. They were convicted on criminal charges related to taking over 100 million yuan in bribes, and sentenced to life in prison.
Career
Wan was born in a village in Wuhua County, Guangdong to a family of farmers, the second of two children; their sister was eight years their senior and used their savings to support their education. Wan took the surname of their mother. Wan walked five kilometers to a neighbouring town to attend high school. They did poorly on their first attempt at the gaokao exam and continued informal schooling, eventually earning an admission to Jiaying Teacher's College (now Jiaying University). In college Wan edited various campus magazines. After graduation Wan stayed at their alma mater as a lecturer. They met their wife at the college and they had a son. In 1986, they entered the party propaganda department in Meizhou, beginning their career in politics. In 1998 they became party chief of Jiaoling County. In 2000, they were promoted to head the provincial Communist Youth League organization.
In 2008, they were Vice Governor of Guangdong Province and was part of a group working to convert the Pearl River Delta region into a "core region of modern manufacturing" to replace older factories that had been closing. They signed an agreement with ASEAN, which CCTV.com said was designed to "explore and facilitate cooperation activities in various areas including agriculture, information and communication technology, trade and investment, tourism promotion, energy and environment, education and public health."
Representing Guangdong province, they signed an agreement to expand University of Macao on Guangdong's Hengqin Island, but under the jurisdiction of the Macao Special Administrative Region.
They were head of Guangdong province's participation in the 2010 World Expo. In November 2010, Wan was elected as vice president of the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).
In 2011, Wan told the media that they "after working for twenty years, I have yet to buy a home. I pay rent of 600 yuan a month for a 130 square meter flat in the Zhujiang Jingdi community." Wan was widely ridiculed for this incident, as it was later revealed that a similar sized home in that very neighbourhood cost at least 4,000 yuan a month to rent. The incident earned Wan the nickname "emperor of the six hundred" online.
Investigation
In 2013, a large number of Wan's associates and subordinates were detained for investigation, including vice-mayor Cao Jianliao. On June 26, 2014, Wan appeared in a "mass line" discussion conference, emphasizing, "when you engage in self-criticism, be daring, criticize yourself, criticize each other, don't be afraid." On June 27, Wan was attending a meeting at the provincial government when they were suddenly taken away by investigators. Plans for their scheduled visit to Guangzhou University were scrapped. Wan was the third alternate member of Central Committee to be investigated for abuses since the 18th Party Congress. On June 30, Wan was dismissed from their posts as a member of the provincial Party Standing Committee and party chief of Guangzhou.
On October 9, 2014, Wan was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party following an internal investigation. The investigations led to criminal charges of bribery. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said that Wan sought benefits for others through abuse of power, solicited and accepted large bribes, violated the "Eight-point Regulation", and often frequented private clubs. It was reported that the club they frequented in the Baiyun Mountain was closed by the authorities. At the fourth plenum of the 18th Central Committee held on October 23, the full Central Committee ratified Wan's expulsion from the body and the party itself.
Wan was put on trial in Nanning in neighbouring Guangxi. During the trial, the prosecution accused Wan of taking some 111.25 million yuan (~$16.5 million) in bribes personally or through an associate, in exchange for political favours or promotions. Wan Qingliang was sentenced to life in prison on September 30, 2016.

Takao Umemoto was a Japanese psychologist whose specific interest was music psychology; they were also an academic, and pianist.
Early life
Umemoto was born and raised in Kyoto, Japan (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto's father was a professor in psychology and a practicing Buddhist monk at Higashi-Honganji temple. They valued music and pressed Umemoto to dedicate their youth to music and playing piano. This would later influence their career, inspiring the topics of their research and lectures. They would continue to play piano till their death (Osaka, 2003).
Education
Umemoto graduated from Kyoto University in 1948, continued through graduate school, and graduated in 1952. Umemoto earned their Ph.D. in 1966 from Kyoto University (Koyasu, 2002). The beginning of their career and their early experiments aligned with the direct growth and attention on perception and cognition, present in Japan, after they earned their Ph.D.(Imada et al., 2016).
Career
Umemoto was a lecturer in the department of educational psychology at Kyoto University in Japan before becoming associate professor at the faculty of education at Kyoto University (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto became a professor at Konan Women's University in the 1980s after retiring from Kyoto University, they lectured on music psychology (Osaka, 2003). The boom in women entering universities and fields of science made Umemoto's lecturers at Konan influential. Konan Women's University took part in supporting the 20% increase in Japanese Psychological Association along with other progressive (for the 1980s) universities (Imada et al., 2016).
Umemoto worked on creating valid tests and measures in music psychology.  They are known for their research on absolute pitch and the creation of schema used in cognitive music research (Osaka, 2002). Much like early psychologists attempting to measure and explore their ideologies and theories, Takao did the same in their research. They published one of their most famous books, ‘Music Psychology' in 1966 (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto wrote more than 160 articles and published 4 books over their career (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto served as Dean of Kyoto University from 1976 to 1977 (Koyasu, 2002). They initiated the creation of the Association of Music Perception and Cognition in Japan (Osaka, 2003). Due to the positive response to the association, characterized by increase in members and public interest, they organized the first international conference on the subject (Koyasu, 2002).

Rita Panahi (born 3 March 1976) is an American-born Australian right-wing opinion columnist. They work for The Herald and Weekly Times (HWT), a subsidiary of News Corp Australia and is the host of The Friday Show on Sky News and is a contributor to Sunrise on the Seven Network.  They are on the radio at 3AW and 2GB.
Early life and education
Rita Panahi was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, United States, the child of Iranian parents. Them mother was a midwife and their father was an agricultural engineer. The family returned to Iran during their infancy, living on the coast and moving to Tehran by 1979. Them mother worked for a hospital associated with the Shah during the Iranian Revolution.
Panahi described their parents as "relaxed Muslims who were not particularly political". However, their family was targeted by the Shia Islamist government of the Ayatollah Khomeini. In 1984, they were accepted by Australia as refugees and lived in Melbourne.
Panahi worked in banking while attending Monash University, studying but not completing a Bachelor of Business Finance. They joined Australian Young Labor and volunteered in the 1996 election campaign. Panahi worked as a personal banker at Colonial Mutual and was the youngest branch manager in the company's history. They have a child with an undisclosed father and is a single parent at present.
Media career
Panahi initially wrote for the daily free commuter newspaper mX, writing a weekly sports gossip column. Them column was picked up for a second year and by 2007 they were a regular guest on the AM sports radio station SEN. They earned their MBA from Swinburne. In September 2007, Panahi began working for the Herald Sun, published by the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT), a subsidiary of News Corp Australia. Panahi is also a regular guest on Sky News and Sunrise on the Seven Network.  They are also a radio commentator on 3AW and 2GB.
In March 2018, Panahi began hosting The Friday Show on Sky News Live.
Views
Panahi is described as a conservative.  They are a former Muslim and is critical of aspects of Islam. Panahi has accused what they regard as the regressive left for abetting Islamism in the West, stating "the former excuse behaviour that they would never tolerate from non-Muslims." They have described Western feminists who view modesty veils such as burkas, niqabs and hijabs as symbols of diversity or empowerment as an example of such abetment. However, they oppose a complete ban on Muslim immigration. They support offshore detention camps for illegal immigrants, while also supporting asylum seekers who arrive to Australia by boat. They have argued against the burqa and has criticised non-Western women who wear hijabs in solidarity with Muslim women, arguing that the hijab is a political symbol as well as a religious one, and that it was forced on them as a child in Iran. They have supported statements against veils made by fellow former Muslims such as Darya Safai and Yasmine Mohammed.
Panahi has claimed that they were previously in favour of republicanism but now supports retaining the Monarchy of Australia, arguing that monarchy is a flawed system but "the reality is that it works for Australia. We have a stable system of government with a figurehead who is benign, much admired and not interested in interfering in our affairs." They have also expressed opposition to the views of Australian Republican Movement's chairperson Peter FitzSimons and agreed with an assessment made by former Senator David Leyonhjelm that debates over the monarchy is a non-issue for average Australians but one obsessively pushed by republicans. However, Panahi has criticised the political statements made by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, arguing they have "trashed" the legacy of Queen Elizabeth. They have also opined that the crown should be passed down to Prince William in the event of the Queen's death.
They have been described as 'surprisingly' progressive on some social issues. Writing for SBS, Margaret Simons observed that Panahi hates homophobia and has argued in favour of women choosing single motherhood, as they have.
In January 2015, Panahi sparred with Andrew O'Keefe on Weekend Sunrise over Islamic extremists. They said "We've got to stop ... pretending like Islam is like any other religion as far as being behind incidences of terror" and "if you value the rights of women you'd have issues with the burqa".
In January 2015, they wrote an article entitled "Islam, you have a very serious problem" which was published in the Daily Telegraph. News website New Matilda published an open letter critical of Panahi's article.
In a debate over racism in early 2016, Panahi was on a team opposing ABC presenter Stan Grant. Panahi argued that Australia should not be characterised as racist.
In January 2017, Panahi was encouraged by Michael Kroger to stand for Liberal Party pre-selection in the Victorian state electorate of Frankston.
Ahead of the 2020 United States Presidential election, Panahi maintained that while they had some disagreements and reservations about Donald Trump, they favoured their re-election and argued that a Trump victory would be more beneficial to Australian national security over a Biden presidency. They furthermore accused the media of ignoring the increase in black, gay and Hispanic support for Trump in order to accuse them of racism. Panahi believes Joe Biden has engaged in inappropriate behavior with young girls and is in a cognitive decline.

L'Ankou, written and drawn by Fournier, is the twenty-seventh album of the Spirou et Fantasio series, and the author's seventh, following the Spirou retirement of André Franquin. The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine, before it was released as a hardcover album in 1977.
Story
In L'Ankou, Ororéa invites Spirou and Fantasio to join them at a congress of magicians in Brittany. When they arrive, they meet strange L'Ankou, who objects to the presence of a nuclear thermal power station on their land. They then save Ororéa from an aggression, but the gangsters manage to escape. At their arrival at the hotel, they find out that Itoh Kata is amongst the magicians invited. The others are telepath Al Kazar, hypnotist monk Capuccino and telekinesist Rethros Athana. Those are currently developing a magic trick based on teleportation.
Fantasio is used as guinea-pig during the first representation but is abducted by the gangsters. Ankou reappears and suggests to Spirou and their friends not to try anything against the kidnappers. The latter exert blackmail on the magicians: they are to deliver a revolutionary product developed at the power station in exchange for Fantasio. Kata decides not to say anything to their friends and together, the magicians steal the product. Meanwhile, Fantasio manages to escape and warns the police with Spirou and Ororéa. The gangsters are arrested but the product stolen by the magicians threatens to explode. Fortunately, Spirou warns the magicians in time and Itoh Kata makes the product vanish. This event leads to the power station closing down. L'Ankou is thus grateful towards Spirou and their companions.

Lovely Anand is an Indian politician and former member of the 10th Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India and also the granddaughter of Freedom Fighter Rameshwar Prasad Sinha.
They come from a well connected political family as their mother's cousin Madhuri Singh was a member of parliament in the 1980's from Congress party. But their political career started as the debutant candidate for the new Bihar People's Party established by their husband, Anand Mohan Singh, Lovely Anand had defeated a heavyweight parliamentarian Kishori Sinha, the wife of former Bihar Chief Minister Satyendra Narayan Sinha, in a 1994 Lok Sabha by-election in the north Bihar constituency of Vaishali. They did not contest the 1996 elections and failed to re-win it in those of 1999.
Kishori Sinha also happened to be mother in law of their cousin Shyama Singh (daughter of Madhuri Singh).
Anand has also twice been elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Bihar, winning once in Barh and again in Nabinagar.
Them husband, Anand Mohan Singh, whom they had married in 1991, and who had engineered their 1994 by-election success, is serving a life sentence for abetting murder. They had twice been the MP for Sheohar, in 1996 and 1998, and their wife stood as a Samajwadi Party candidate there in the 2014 general election. They claimed that they had switched party allegiance because the Indian National Congress (INC) had "neglected" them after they had unsuccessfully stood as their candidate in that constituency in the 2009 national election and in the Alamnagar constituency at the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections.
In 2015, Anand became involved with the Hindustani Awam Morcha party and contested from Sheohar constituency. They lost the elections by a margin of around 400 votes.
Anand has continued to protest the innocence of their husband, standing for election on that basis and claiming that their husband is the victim of a political conspiracy and has never been a criminal or gang leader. They and some others had been found guilty in the same case as that of their husband, which was determined in 2007 when they were a member of the JDU party, but they later obtained bail and was acquitted on appeal to the High Court.
Anand has a BA degree from Ranchi University. They and their husband have 2 sons and a daughter; their son, Chetan Anand, has also expressed a desire to be elected.

Robert Jousie or Joussie or Jowsie or Jossie (died 1626) was a Scottish merchant, financier, and courtier.
Life
Jousie was a cloth merchant based in Edinburgh with a house on the High Street or Royal Mile. They became an exclusive supplier of fabrics to James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark. Their accounts for royal fabrics survive in the National Archives of Scotland, and have been quoted by historians including Hugo Arnot, who noted that James VI bought ostrich feathers and beaver hats. The record includes masque costumes for James VI and Anne of Denmark, who danced in masques at weddings in the first years of the 1590s. The masque clothes included lightweight taffeta and metallic tinsel or "tock" fabrics.
Royal marriage
Jousie lent money to the Scottish ambassador William Stewart, Commendator of Pittenweem, who was sent to Denmark in 1588, 1589, and 1590. Jousie also supplied silks and velvets to Stewart, and their debt totalled 3,600 merks.
Partnered with the goldsmith and financier Thomas Foulis, James VI sent them to London in July 1589 to buy clothes and ornaments in preparation for their marriage to Anna of Denmark. James gave them a pledge of two cut rubies and three cabochon rubies set in gold "chattons" or buttons from the crown jewels for these purchases.
Jousie and Foulis sometimes collected the subsidy money which Elizabeth I gave to James VI. In December 1591 Jousie was detained or delayed for a time in Berwick-upon-Tweed, and James wrote to Elizabeth of their "endless detaining" and an errand "turned from one honorable annuity to a voluntary uncertainty with long begging".
In April 1593 the English ambassador Lord Burgh and the resident diplomat Robert Bowes borrowed £300 sterling from Robert Jousie, Thomas Foulis, and John Porterfield in order to reward potential supporters of English policy.
Textiles for the royal wardrobes
In 1590 Sir William Keith of Delny, out-going Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe, paid Jousie 10,000 Scottish merks for silk fabrics already supplied to the king. Jousie was owed a further £19,000 for "apparel and other necessaries" supplied to the king at the time of marriage.
Robert Jousie supplied fabrics to the tailors Alexander Miller and Peter Sanderson who worked for the keeper of the royal wardrobe Sir George Home in the 1590s. The fabric contract was in part financed by money sent as a gift or subsidy to James VI by Queen Elizabeth. Fowlis and Jousie continued to make purchases in London for the king, filling four trunks and four packs in 1593.
Jousie provided textiles for the Masque at the baptism of Prince Henry in 1594. These were financed by using Anna of Denmark's dowry, which had been invested in various towns. Jousie received £1000 from Aberdeen.
In July 1594 they were paid £18,280 Scots from the English subsidy or annuity money sent to James VI, for the clothes they had supplied to the king and queen.
Sir Robert Melville resigned as Treasurer of Scotland in March 1595. They owed Jousie £20,000 which the king undertook to repay. Their daughter-in-law, Margaret Ker, owed Jousie a personal debt of £233.
In September 1597 Jousie went to London to collect the annuity and carried letters from John Lindsay of Balcarres to William and Robert Cecil. They were delayed in England waiting for the subsidy. James VI wrote to Elizabeth I about their "endless detaining", saying that Jousie's "errand, it is turned from an honourable annuity to a volutntary uncertainty almost after long begging".
Bankrupt
Foulis was bankrupted in 1598. They gave a statement of their debts to Parliament, which included £145,700 and interest on that sum to £33,000 Scots. The roll submitted to Parliament listed the names of the creditors of Foulis and Jousie, who had loaned them money with which they financed the court. It includes the Edinburgh Company of Tailors, based on the Cowgate, who had lent £1,200, the merchant and poet John Burell, and Bartholomew Kello, the husband of the calligrapher Esther Inglis. Kello's loan of £4,000 was one of the larger contributions, and the merchant Jacob Baron had invested £14,822 Scots.
In May 1598 James Hudson wrote that Foulis had pawned a gold lion set with a ruby worth £400 with the London goldsmith Robert Brook of Lombard Street, which Hudson suggested belonged to James VI. Robert Jousie was unable to pay Brook's interest or other sums due by Hudson, or the money they jointly owed to Hudson. Hudson considered having Jousie arrested for debt in London.
Despite the bankruptcy, the purchasing arrangement for the royal wardrobe continued, and they bought a sapphire engraved with Elizabeth's portrait in London for Anna of Denmark in January 1599. However, the English creditors of Thomas Foulis arrested Jousie in London for debts and they were imprisoned for a time. Despite the efforts of James Elphinstone, the Secretary of State, Sir Robert Cecil could not assist to free them until there was some assurance of repayment. In February 1599 the Privy Council declared that in future the Treasurer would administer the English annuity or subsidy, spending it on clothes for the royal family and the household of Prince Henry.
The English textile merchant and financier Baptist Hicks wrote to James VI on 1 March 1599 hoping for repayment of sums due to them by Jousie. They had written twice to the king, and was disappointed to hear from the Scottish ambassador that they would not be paid from the annuity awarded by Queen Elizabeth.
England
In England, after the Union of the Crowns, Jousie was appointed Groom of the Bedchamber, Groom or Yeoman of the Robes, and deputy Keeper of the Privy Purse, in the years 1606 to 1611. They were Yeoman of the Robes to Prince Henry.
In October 1606 George Home, now the Earl of Dunbar, sent them to give money to the minister Andrew Melville and their colleagues, in packets disguised as sugar loaves.
Jousie bought an estate at Baynards in Surrey in 1610.
When William Betoun, the embroiderer to the royal family in Scotland, died in 1620, Robert Jousie still owed them 800 merks.
Robert Jousie died in London in 1626, without making a will, and details of their family are unclear. The historian Dr Robert Johnston (d. 1639) was at their deathbed.
Family
Jousie's wife was called Margaret. They had two sons and a daughter.
James Jousie or Jossey alias Hay, mortgaged their interests in the Baynards estate to Richard Gurnard or Gurney (d. 1647), a London clothworker. Gurney sold it to Richard Evelyn, the father of diarist John Evelyn, who acquired the whole property in 1631. James Jousie of Baynards married a daughter of George Heriot (1563-1624), Elizabeth Band.
Robert Jousie, who went to Spain with Prince Charles in 1623, and came to Edinburgh in 1633 with Charles I as Yeoman of the Robes.
Elizabeth (b. 1609), described as a gentlewoman, married James Heriot (d. 1634) on 4 January 1624. They were a jeweller to Charles I of England, and a son of George Heriot (died 1610), at St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. After James Heriot's death, Elizabeth Jousie married David Cunningham of Robertland in 1637, who corresponded with their cousin, the receiver of royal rents, David Cunningham of Auchenharvie about the match. Auchenharvie mentioned them in their letters as Heriot's "sweet bedfellow" and wrote in 1635 that "she is yet a widow but not like to continue, being much importuned with sundry suitors of quality". Auchenharvie sided with Elizabeth Jousie and Robert Jousie junior in a lawsuit in 1636.
A friend and relation, John Jousie (d. 1621), was a wealthy Scottish merchant resident in London. They made Robert Joussie of Baynards and Robert Johnston their executors and left money to Johnson and Robert Jousie's friend, John Fortune. They made several legacies in Scottish money and to the poor in the Hospital of Edinburgh. Their son, also John Jousie, may have been a merchant in Edinburgh.
Another member of the Heriot family, also called George Heriot, who died in London in July 1625 was described as Robert Jousie's servitor or servant.
A cargo in 1586
A list of goods belonging to Robert Jousie in a ship's cargo of 1586 survives to give some idea of their business. They lost; a dozen hats lined with taffeta worth £20; 15 beaver hats worth £76, 12 hats lined with taffeta worth £27; 36 hat bands worth £14; 24 hat bands of silk crêpe worth £23; 12 crêpe hat bands worth £6; 24 hat bands for children worth 22 shillings. The ship had run aground in Norfolk.
Robert Jousie's house in Edinburgh
In June 1593 Jousie's house in Edinburgh was the scene of a scandalous abduction, while they were travelling to London. James Gray, a servant of James VI and brother of the Master of Gray, had abducted and married Catherine Carnegie daughter of John, Laird of Carnegie, and niece of David Carnegie of Colluthie. They protested and was given a refuge in Robert Jousie's house. Gray sent their friend John Wemyss of Logie to quietly break into the house. When Logie discovered that they were still inside, they signalled to their accomplices including Sir James Sandilands to break down the doors and carry them back to Gray, while Lord Home and their followers prevented any would-be rescuers intervening. Catherine eventually married Sir John Hamilton of Lettrick.
The house was apparently the scene of a rope trick on 10 July 1598, when an acrobat performed on a cable between the fore-stair of the house and the steeple of St Giles.

Commander Wilfred Albert "Biffy" Dunderdale, (24 December 1899 – 13 November 1990) was a British spy and intelligence officer. It has been suggested that Dunderdale was used by Ian Fleming as a basis for the character of James Bond.
Life
Wilfred Dunderdale was born in Odessa, son of Richard Albert Dunderdale, a shipping magnate.
Dunderdale served in the Royal Navy during the First World War, despite their thick accent.
They worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) between 1921 and 1959. Their work involved liaison with French intelligence (1926–40) and Polish intelligence (1940–45).
Later moving to New York, they died there in November 1990. According to notes compiled by Stephen Dorril for their 1989 book, A Who's Who of the British State, Dunderdale was a member of Boodle's.

Elkhorn Tavern is a two-story, wood-frame structure that served as a physical center for the American Civil War Battle of Pea Ridge, also known as the Battle of Elkhorn Tavern, which was fought on March 7 and March 8, 1862, approximately five miles east of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, located in the northeastern Benton County, Arkansas. The tavern, a replica built in 1865 following the burning of the original building by bushwhackers, is now the centerpiece of the Pea Ridge National Military Park, which includes approximately around the structure, including the restored battlefields, a stretch of the pre-war Telegraph Road, which runs directly in front of the tavern, and a section of the Trail of Tears. The tavern is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Before the war
The first Elkhorn Tavern was built about 1833 by William Ruddick and their son-in-law Samuel Burks, and was first known as Ruddick Inn. It was from this tavern that the two families, between 1837 and 1839, watched a portion of the forced Indian migration across the northern course of the Trail of Tears. An early detachment of 336 Cherokees camped near Ruddick Inn on December 23, 1837. By 1839 more than 11,000 Indians had passed the tavern.
Following the deaths of William and Betsey Ruddick, Burks became sole proprietor in 1852. In 1858, they sold the house and the to their cousins Jesse and Polly Cox for $3600. It was Cox who later renamed it Elkhorn Tavern. Under Cox' management, the structure served as a trading post, an unofficial Butterfield Overland Mail stop, post office, voting place, eating establishment, church of the Benton County Baptist Society, and inn. As the war moved near, Jesse Cox left the tavern to the care of their son and daughter-in-law Joseph and Lucinda Pratt Cox and went to Kansas.
During the Battle of Elkhorn Tavern/Pea Ridge
When the fighting around the tavern began, the Cox family (Joseph and Lucinda Cox, along with Joseph's mother, Polly) did not leave their home. They grabbed only a few necessities for survival and retreated to the building's cellar. The family remained in the cellar for three days and nights, March 7–9, 1862, as the battle was waged above them. The upper floors of the tavern served as a makeshift hospital for wounded troops, many undergoing surgery and amputations with no anesthetic, and for a short time served as Confederate General Earl Van Dorn's headquarters. The tavern was hit many times by gunfire during the battle, including a cannonball that tore through the second floor, but the building remained standing.
When the fighting finally subsided on March 9, 1862, the scene around the tavern was one of devastation, with the bodies of men and horses scattered across the battlefield and even the trees surrounding the property broken and scarred by the fighting.
After the battle
Following the battle, the Cox family temporarily moved a short distance from the tavern, in order to complete and repair the structure, and clean the surrounding area before moving back. It was during this absence that bushwhackers struck, burning the tavern to the ground in January 1863.
Since the original building's foundation and chimneys were still in good shape, the Cox family rebuilt on the original foundation and chimneys. The new building was completed in 1865.
A National Park
Elkhorn Tavern remained in the Cox family for nearly a century following the war, with Frances Cox Scot, who was born in the tavern in 1865, inheriting the building after the deaths of their father and mother, Joseph and Lucinda Cox, in 1903 and 1902 respectively. Scot lived and even ran a small Civil War museum in the tavern until 1959, when it was purchased to become part of the newly created Pea Ridge National Military Park. Following the sale, Scot moved to nearby Garfield, Arkansas and died the following year at the age of 95.
Once the property was purchased for the Pea Ridge National Military Park, the tavern was renovated to make it more closely resemble the structure from 1862. Today, Elkhorn Tavern is open to visitors from fall to spring, with costumed volunteers giving a lesson on the history and culture of the site and its former residents.
The Elkhorn name
The name for the tavern came from a carpenter who, on their way to the tavern, shot an elk about a quarter mile from the building. They removed the horns and gave them to Jesse Cox, who originally placed them on a pole, but later situated them on the roof ridge between the chimneys. An early set of elk antlers are on display inside the tavern building, though the park routinely replaces the set placed on the roof of the building when they become damaged by the weather or animals.

The Clarke–Harrell–Burson House is a historic house at 603 Parkview in Van Buren, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood-frame structure with Greek Revival styling, built about 1841, and is believed to have been the first non-log house built in the area known as Logtown that is now part of the city of Van Buren. The house is locally notable for several prominent residents: George Washington Clarke was the publisher of Arkansas's first newspaper west of Little Rock, the Intelligencer, which began publication in 1842 and was taken over by Clarke in 1844. The house's next owner, the Rev. Jonathan Harrell, was the first Methodist minister in the region, and a founding member of the Arkansas Methodist conference. Later in the 19th century it was owned by Dr. Edward Burson, a veteran of the American Civil War and a prominent local dentist.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

A number of different numbering and classification schemes have been used for carriages and wagons on Britain's railways, and this page explains the principal systems. Carriages and wagons (either not self-propelled, or part of a multiple unit which has power units distributed throughout a semi-permanent formation of carriages) have frequently had similar arrangements for classification and numbering, so are considered together. There are also links to other pages that deal in greater depth with the particulars of individual types.
Note on classification
Carriage and wagon classification has never been quite the same as locomotive and multiple unit classification. For most railways, specific types were identified by their Diagram Number. This could simply be arranged by consecutive number, or there could be some greater organisation of numbers so that similar types were grouped together.
However, carriages and wagons have rarely been referred to in general terms by their Diagram Number. Instead there have been a variety of other codes and designations, referring to generic designs rather than specific types. For instance, there were the BR (adapted from the LNER system) and LMS carriage codes, which indicated interior layout or usage. The Great Western Railway (GWR) identified some of their non-passenger carriages and wagons through a series of animal designations, including sea life for departmental (non-revenue earning) stock, followed by a letter for detail differences, e.g. Beetle A.
The majority of the sections below deal solely with carriage and wagon numbering series, though where a particular classification system was used this is also described.
Pre-nationalisation arrangements
Before nationalisation in 1948, each railway company had its own numbering arrangements.
The Great Western Railway and London, Midland and Scottish Railway (from 1933) adopted a system which allocated number ranges within a series for different types.
The Southern Railway followed a similar approach, but used two series; for passenger carriages and for non-passenger carriages.
The London and North Eastern Railway numbered its carriages with the first digit indicating the area it was allocated to.
The Great Western Railway Diagram Numbers included a letter to indicate the general layout or usage, followed by a serial number issued consecutively.
British Railways
British Railways inherited the stock of the 'Big Four' and a substantial number of 'Private Owner' wagons. It also inherited the stock of the Pullman Car Company when it was nationalised in the late 1950s.
Numbering system
Arrangements at Nationalisation
The numbers of carriages and wagons inherited from the 'Big Four' companies were left unchanged, but with a prefix letter to show where they had originated from, as follows:
A "D" prefix in front of the regional prefix indicated departmental (non-revenue earning) stock. Departmental stock (including locomotives) inherited from the Southern Railway carried numbers with an "S" suffix (indicating Service stock, an alternative term for departmental) which was deleted and replaced with the "DS" prefix.
Former 'Private Owner' wagons, owned by industrial concerns rather than the railway companies, had a prefix letter "P" but were renumbered into a new series commencing at 3000.
Some carriages and wagons built by British Railways to the designs of the 'Big Four' companies were numbered in their series and carried the appropriate letter prefix. BR then introduced its own number series, for wagons beginning with B. Initially most designs were based on, or similar to, those of the pre-Nationalisation companies.
Arrangements from 1951
In 1951, the first production carriages built to British Railways' designs appeared, known as the Mark I. Numbers had a prefix letter (or letters) to indicate the region to which the carriage was allocated, and responsible for the maintenance. The inherited carriages then had a suffix letter indicating the company of origin.
New carriages had no suffix: when Pullman Company carriages were added, their numbers carried both prefix and a suffix (indicating regional allocation), as did the 2 tier car carriers built for the East Coast services.
The regional allocation letters used were:
Wagons retained the existing prefixes indicating their origin, and new stock built to British Railways designs was given a "B" prefix.
British Railways adopted the following numbering system for carriages and wagons built to its own designs (a small number of types built to pre-Nationalisation designs were later allocated numbers in this series, but only following rebuilding to new types). Note that in this table, reference is made to first, second and third class; from June 1956, second class was abolished and third class was renamed second class (and again to standard class in 1987). The few BR-design second class carriages (intended for use in Boat Trains since ships had three classes of accommodation) were designated as first class or unclassified.
Numbers 100000 to 999999 were used for non-passenger rated stock (including wagons, vans and departmental (non-revenue earning) carriages), while internal user vehicles (stock used for internal purposes (e.g. stores) at specific locations and unlikely to move) took numbers in the 0xxxxx series. For more details see below.
The same series was used for Mark 2 coaches built in the 1960s, but when Mark 3 carriage was introduced in the early 1970s new number ranges were carved out of the old series. These new ranges were perpetuated for Mark 4 carriages in the 1980s, and were as follows:
Diesel multiple unit builds in the 1980s utilised the 52xxx, 55xxx, 57xxx and 58xxx series for carriages, all of which were motored. The 55xxx and 58xxx contained a mix of driving and non-driving motors, but the 52xxx and 57xxx cars were all driving motors. Some series have been used for conversions of carriages, e.g. 63xx has been used for a variety of miscellaneous carriages, including generator vans and observation saloons.
A major change came in May 1983 when prefix and suffix letters was abandoned, and any carriage that had the same number as another carriage or a locomotive was renumbered. The programme worked as follows:
Further renumberings have taken place as new locomotives were introduced. Most have involved only a handful of carriages, but a major one saw carriages in the 920xx series renumbered 929xx when Class 92 locomotives were introduced.
This series has been perpetuated, though the series have been adapted for new generation multiple unit stock. For instance, the latest diesel multiple units have reused the 50xxx and 79xxx series for driving motors and the 56xxx series for non-driving motors. In the electric multiple unit series, Class 390 Pendolinos have reused the 68xxx and 69xxx series.
When BR began to build air braked wagons they had B prefixes, but this was dropped and six-figure numbers were used without prefix. Prefixes were added, however, if and when carriages and wagons transferred to the departmental/engineers' fleets.
Privately owned wagons and carriages were allocated numbers with an integral prefix to differentiate them from the BR number series, with carriages taking numbers in the 954xx and 99xxx series. From 1986, those carriages in the 99xxx series which otherwise duplicated BR bullion and exhibition van numbers were renumbered, and from then on the prefix was not essential for identification. Post-privatisation, with all carriages being privately owned, this list was discontinued and many carriages reverted to carrying their original BR number.
Departmental and Internal User Stock
Most departmental and internal user vehicles are converted from revenue-earning stock; only a small number are built for non-revenue earning use. Initially stock inherited from the 'Big Four' companies was given regional prefixes (e.g. DE, DM, DS and DW) indicating their origin, and adapting existing number series.
From about 1951, British Railways started to use new numbering series for additions to departmental and internal user stock on a regional basis, as follows:
No prefix letters were used for internal user stock. Departmental wagons (and some passenger-rated non-passenger carrying coaching stock) often kept their original revenue earning stock number, but with the addition of the "D" prefix. On some occasions, passenger coaches that had been converted for use as wagons then entered departmental stock retaining their wagon number (most notably brake vans in the 963xxx series that were formerly passenger brake vehicles).
By the end of the 1960s, British Rail-built carriages were entering departmental stock and being allocated one of the regional prefixes according to their location, but from 1967 the "DB" prefix was introduced for all additions to departmental stock regardless of origin. This prefix was prefixed with a letter to indicate the use of the vehicle, as follows:
The principal numbering series for carriages with the "DB" prefix have been 975xxx, then 977xxx. The latest series to be used is 971xxx. Carriages built new into departmental stock have usually been numbered in the 999xxx (and sometimes 998xxx) series (though this series also contains some conversions too).
Also in the early days of the "DB" prefix, some departmental locomotives were numbered in the 966xxx and 968xxx series, though in recent years those locomotives that remain self-propelled have been allocated locomotive Class 97.
TOPS CARKND classification system
When the Total Operations Processing System was introduced by British Railways, classifications were applied to all carriages and wagons and recorded in a field called CARKND, which is now also used to refer to the classification system as a whole. The classification typically comprises three letters, the first of which indicates the broad type, as follows:
The second letter gave more detailed information, different for each series. The tables below list the variations for carriages:
Apart from hauled passenger carriages ('A' series), the final letter indicated the braking arrangements. Nowadays almost all stock is air-braked, but when TOPS was introduced there was much greater variety, which made marshalling trains more complicated and this information essential. The letters were:
For hauled passenger carriages ('A' series), the suffix denoting the braking arrangements was replaced by two characters as follows:
An additional digit denoted the class of passenger accommodation:
The final suffix indicated the build of the coach:
This resulted in a 4 character alphanumeric TOPS classification, such as AB21 representing a Mark 1 Brake Corridor Second (BSK).

David Michael Krueger (March 5, 1939 – March 5, 2010), best known by their birth name, Peter Woodcock, was a Canadian serial killer, child rapist and diagnosed psychopath. They gained notoriety for the murders of three young children in Toronto in the late 1950s, as well as for a murder in 1991 on their first day of unsupervised release from the psychiatric institution in which they had been incarcerated for their earlier crimes.
An adopted child, Krueger lived in numerous foster homes as an infant, and showed signs of severe emotional trauma when they found a permanent foster home at the age of 3. Unable to adjust to social situations, they were bullied by their peers. They would often wander from their home by foot, bicycle or train to parts of Toronto, where they would molest dozens of children, and ultimately murder three. Found not guilty by reason of insanity for their crimes, they were sent to a psychiatric facility. Psychiatrists placed them in experimental treatment programs for psychopathy, but those treatments proved ineffective when they murdered a fellow psychiatric patient in 1991; after their death in 2010, they were described in the Toronto Star as "the serial killer they couldn't cure."
Early life
Peter Woodcock was born in Peterborough, Ontario to a 17-year-old factory worker, Waita Woodcock, who gave them up for adoption after breastfeeding them for a month. Adoption agency records report that the newborn, Peter, showed feeding problems and cried constantly. As an infant, they stayed in various foster homes, unable to bond with any of their foster parents. After their first birthday, they became terrified of anybody approaching him, and their speech was incoherent—described as strange whining animal noises. They were also physically abused by at least one of their early foster parents, with a 2-year-old Woodcock having to be given medical treatment for an injured neck after receiving a beating. They were placed into a stable home at the age of 3 with foster parents Frank and Susan Maynard, an upper-middle-class couple with another son. Susan Maynard, who was described as a "forceful woman with an exaggerated sense of propriety", became strongly attached to the maladjusted child who would still scream when someone approached him. By the age of 5, Woodcock remained socially maladjusted and became the target of neighbourhood bullies.
Worried about the child's fragile emotional state, Frank and Susan Maynard would regularly bring them to the Hospital for Sick Children, where Woodcock received extensive treatment. Woodcock was sent to a private school, but again failed to make friends or interact successfully with their peers and remained isolated. By the age of 11, they were described as an "angry little boy"; a Children's Aid Society report on them from that time read:
Signs of Woodcock's violent fantasies were present at this time also, seen when a social worker was walking with them at the Canadian National Exhibition and Woodcock muttered, "I wish a bomb would fall on the Exhibition and kill all the children". Woodcock was sent to a school for emotionally disturbed children in Kingston, Ontario, and began acting on their strong sexual urges with other children—with Woodcock stating that here they had consensual intercourse with a 12-year-old girl when they were 13. When they turned 15, they were discharged from this school and returned to live with their foster parents, but was soon re-enrolled at their original private school, where they again failed to connect with their peers. At the age of 16, they left the private school again and was sent to a public high school, where children from the neighborhood instantly recognized them and resumed the bullying; they transferred to a private high school six weeks later. While their peers again shunned him, their teachers there remembered them as a very bright student who excelled in science, history, and English, and who frequently scored 100 percent on their tests.
Early crimes
Peter Woodcock's prized possession was a red and white Schwinn bicycle on which they satisfied their continuing compulsion to wander. They rode the bike to the far reaches of the city—even during the deep, cold Toronto winters—and evolved a fantasy in which they led a gang of 500 invisible boys on bikes called the 'Winchester Heights Gang'. Their foster parents were aware of this fantasy and their compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that they had begun travelling around Toronto on their bike and sexually assaulting children.
Murder of Wayne Mallette
On September 15, 1956, 17-year-old Woodcock was riding their bike around the grounds of the Exhibition Place when they met 7-year-old Wayne Mallette. They lured the boy out of sight and then proceeded to strangle them to death. Mallette's body was found in the early hours of September 16. It appeared that their clothing had been removed and they had then been re-dressed. Their face was pushed into the dirt and two bite marks were found on the body—one on the boy's calf and the other on their buttock. There was no evidence of rape, however. Pennies were found scattered near the body. Woodcock had defecated next to the victim as well.
Toronto Police initially arrested and interrogated another boy, Ron Moffatt. Through relentless questioning they extracted a confession from then 14-year-old Moffatt. Despite witnesses who clearly placed them in a movie theatre before and after the murder of Wayne Mallette, they were found guilty and sentenced to youth detention. Eventually police acknowledged there was a serial predator in Toronto, but Moffatt was not released. However, when notes were shared between forces, Woodcock was arrested. After their conviction, Woodcock was called as a defence witness for Moffatt. The wrongful murder charge was stayed in 1957, and Moffatt was released from custody. Nate Hendley published in 2018 an account of Moffatt's experience, The Boy on the Bicycle.
Murder of Gary Morris
On October 6, 1956, Woodcock was riding their bike around Cabbagetown when they picked up 9-year-old Gary Morris. They then drove the boy to Cherry Beach, where they strangled and beat them to death—with a coroner later determining that Morris had died from a ruptured liver. Morris' body was found with a bite mark on their throat and, this time, paper clips seemed to have been ritualistically sprinkled near the corpse. Again, the clothing had been removed from the victim and then they had been re-dressed.
Murder of Carole Voyce
On January 19, 1957, Woodcock was again riding their bike when they approached 4-year-old Carole Voyce and offered them a ride. They then drove them under the Bloor Viaduct and murdered them When they were found, their clothes had been pulled off. It appeared that they had been choked into unconsciousness and sexually molested, and that their death was caused by a tree branch being forcibly inserted into their vagina.
Apprehension and trial
Witnesses saw a teenager cycling away from Carole Voyce's crime scene and an accurate composite sketch was created based on those witnesses' descriptions. This sketch ran on the front page of the Toronto Star and would lead to Woodcock's arrest on January 21, 1957, and their subsequent confession to all three murders. They recalled upon their arrest: "My fear was that Mother would find out. Mother was my biggest fear. I didn't know if the police would let them at me."
Woodcock was tried only for the murder of Carole Voyce. On April 11, 1957, after a four-day trial, they were found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Oak Ridge division of the maximum-security Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene, Ontario.
Imprisonment
While imprisoned, Woodcock was diagnosed as a psychopath. They underwent various forms of psychiatric therapy, including LSD treatments when they were popular in the 1960s. They were also given other personality-breaking drugs: scopolamine, sodium amytal, methedrine and dexamyl. They were subjected to "dyads"—a personality-breaking therapy in which inmates challenged each other's belief systems—which inmates referred to as "The Hundred-Day Hate-In". Dyads were developed in the late 1950s to early 1960s by a Harvard psychologist and former CIA interrogation and psychological warfare expert, Henry A. Murray. Woodcock did not respond well to these treatments and was not an ideal prisoner. They engaged in coercive sexual acts and exploited their fellow inmates, who were often less intelligent or less sane than they are. They convinced inmates that they had contact with an imaginary gang called The Brotherhood on the outside and that in order to be initiated, inmates had to perform oral sex on them and bring them gifts of cigarettes.
Woodcock was eventually transferred to less-restrictive institutions and ultimately arrived at the Brockville Psychiatric Hospital. Here, staff indulged their passion for trains by taking them to the Smiths Falls Railway Museum, and even took them to see The Silence of the Lambs. During this time, they legally changed their name to David Michael Krueger and rekindled a relationship with Bruce Hamill, an Ottawa killer who had been released from Oak Ridge and was working as a security guard at the Ottawa courthouse. Krueger convinced Hamill an alien brotherhood would solve their problems if they helped kill another Brockville inmate, Dennis Kerr.
Murder of Dennis Kerr
On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill went to a hardware store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and a sleeping bag, then went to the Brockville hospital and signed out the 52-year-old Krueger on their first publicly escorted day pass. Within the first hour of their first unsupervised release in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods. When Dennis Kerr arrived, Krueger struck them in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat them into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating their body, nearly severing their head, and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned themselves in.
Death
For the murder of Dennis Kerr, Krueger was transferred back to the Oak Ridge division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, where they had spent the majority of their 34 preceding years in custody. In the years after Kerr's murder, they were the focus of a biography and several documentary films and sometimes tried to explain why they killed, but they never came up with rational reasons. They said in a 1993 interview: "I'm accused of having no morality, which is a fair assessment, because my morality is whatever the system allows." On March 5, 2010, their 71st birthday, Krueger died of natural causes.

The General Jewish Labour Bund in Romania (, ) was a Jewish socialist party in Romania, adhering to the political line of the General Jewish Labour Bund. Founded in 1922, shortly after the establishment of Greater Romania, it united Jewish socialists in Bukovina, Bessarabia and the Romanian Old Kingdom. Standing for the lay wing of the Jewish representative movement, the Romanian Bund had atheistic leanings and offered an alternative to the mainstream Jewish organization. Like other Bundist groups, but unlike the Marxist-inspired Poale Zion bodies of Bessarabia, it rejected Zionism.
History
In 1922 the Bundists of Bukovina (who had belonged to the Jewish Social Democratic Party in Austria-Hungary) decided to approach the Jewish socialists from the Old Kingdom and Bessarabia and propose a unification. The General Jewish Labour Bund in Romania was founded at a conference in Cernăuţi (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine) on January 6–7, 1923. At the founding conference there were four delegates from the Old Kingdom, three from Bessarabia and from Bukovina there were delegates from Cernăuţi, Rădăuţi, Suceava, Siret and Storojineţ. Soon after the founding of the party, a support organization was founded in the United States, called the Gross Rumänische Arbeiter Liga ("Greater Romanian Workers League").
During the interwar period, the General Jewish Labour Bund stood as one of several small organizations which represented the enlarged Jewish community of Greater Romania, covering the ground between the right-wing representatives of Jewish nationalism and the far left. The party had its main strength in Bessarabia, and to a lesser extent in Bukovina. Well represented at kehilla elections in the Bessarabian city of Chişinău, it lacked political presence in Transylvania. The party had a strong influence in the Yiddish school movement in Bessarabia, but was in competition over political support with the Zionists at Poale Zion and the Agudat Yisrael of Haredi Jews. The Bessarabian branch had also links with the Soviet Communist Party. Bukovina, the Bund was secondary to the Jewish Autonomist movement led by Benno Straucher and their Jewish National People's Party.
At the 1922 Senate election in Czernowitz, the Bundist Leon Gheller, standing for the Romanian Social Democratic Party, was defeated by 1,991 votes to 3,800 for Salo Weisselberger. The seat was beforehand occupied by another Social Democrat, George Grigorovici.
Another (former) Bundist, Litman Ghelerter, led to the creation in July 1928 with Ștefan Voitec of a splinter group from the Romanian Social Democratic Party, the Socialist Workers Party of Romania (PSMR).
Although it survived the disappearance of its Russian mother party (persecuted by the Soviet authorities after 1920), the General Jewish Labour Bund of Romania itself ceased to function at the time of the Second World War.

Patagopteryx is an extinct monotypic genus of patagopterygiforms that lived during the Late Cretaceous, around 80 mya, in what is now the Sierra Barrosa in northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. About the size of a chicken, it is the earliest known unequivocal example of secondary flightlessness: its skeleton shows clear indications that the ancestors of Patagopteryx were flying birds.
Located in strata of the Santonian Bajo de la Carpa Formation, the original remains were discovered by Oscar de Ferrariis, Director of the Natural History Museum of the Comahue National University in Neuquén around 1984–5. They passed them onto noted paleontologist José Bonaparte, who described the species Patagopteryx deferrariisi in 1992.
Characteristics
The Patagopteryx had feet with fused bones, much like modern birds. The bird did not have a wishbone, meaning that it would have been impossible for it to have had the muscles necessary for flying. The legs had very short femurs, characteristic of a running animal. The second toe has a curved claw, but it does not appear to have been used as a weapon. It was omnivorous, and probably traveled in flocks across the plains of South America.

An employment consultant is an expert witness who advises courts and tribunals on employment related issues such as earnings, labour market analysis, residual earning capacity, and retraining. The main area involved is that of personal injury litigation where loss of earnings is an important component of a claim. Employment consultants give evidence on pre- and post-accident earnings, thus establishing a loss of earnings formula. Employment consultants also deal with sex, race and disability discrimination, matrimonial matters and any case involving a loss or dispute of earnings. Increasingly, pay parity is a growth area.
Usually solicitors will use an employment report to quantify the loss of earnings or Smith v. Manchester awards.
An employment consultant, like other experts witnesses, may be instructed by the solicitors for the claimant, the defendant, or as a jointly instructed expert, and may be required to give evidence under oath at trials and tribunal hearings.
Although employment consultants provide reports for many jurisdictions worldwide, the core areas are the countries using the common law system. Because of its different trial and compensation system for personal injury, the United States is less important than might be expected, and the main jurisdictions for which these experts prepare reports are England and Wales, Scotland, Republic of Ireland and South Africa. Most employment experts are based in the UK.
This type of expertise was a growth area from the mid-1980s to the end of the 1990s, but was adversely affected by changes in the United Kingdom, the most important area. These included the withdrawal of legal aid for most personal injury cases, which meant that lawyers operating on a "no win no fee" basis were less likely to take up claims or incur the additional costs.
The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 also meant that the need for an expert report had to be sanctioned by a District Judge, which, together with the introduction of joint instruction also reduced demand.
In the decade since the CPR a number of practitioners have diversified into associated areas such as case management, rehabilitation, and, increasingly, pay parity cases, following the wave of such cases initiated in the mid-2000s by trade unions and the controversial solicitor, Stefan Cross.
A recent (2007) case of importance to employment consultants and personal injury solicitors is Van Wees v Karkour and Walsh. This dealt with the medical aspects of post-traumatic amnesia, but also clarified the financial impact of mild head injury even on those who remain capable of high level work. The judge in the case also made an important ruling that awards to women should not be based on their current lower earnings compared to men in the same occupation, since that would perpetuate inequality in the face of equal pay legislation.

Hellinsia elliottii is a moth of the family Pterophoridae. It is found in North America, including Mississippi, New York, Iowa, Quebec, Alberta and Ontario.
The wingspan is 21–26 mm. The head is very pale fuscous and the thorax and abdomen are whitish fuscous. The legs are white. The forewings are white, tinged with ocher yellow near the base and on the apical third of the costa. There is a very oblique streak of brown scales on the costa near the apex and a dark-brown spot before the fissure. A streak of irregular brown scales extends from the base of the wing to the fissure. The fringes are white. The hindwings are pure white, with a few ocher-yellow scales scattered over the surface in some specimens.
The larvae are light green with long, white, shiny hairs from the tubercles. Except on the prothorax, there is a distinct creamy dorsal line broken in the centre of each segment by a small, round dot of the ground color. Pupation takes place in a green pupa with pale ochreous markings.

This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1563.
Events
February 12–14 – The French poet Pierre de Bocosel de Chastelard is twice caught hiding under the bed of Mary, Queen of Scots – at Holyrood and then at Rossend).  They are arrested by the Earl of Moray on their second attempt and executed at St Andrews Castle on February 22.
March 27 – As part of the English Reformation, the House of Commons passes legislation approving Bible translations into Welsh. This allows Henry Denham to publish their Welsh New Testament in 1567.
c. April – A year into the French Wars of Religion, Pierre de Ronsard composes two defenses of French Catholicism against the Huguenots. On the Huguenot side, anonymous leaflets parody their "remonstrance" genre until a ban on libels is placed by Charles IX of France.
April – As a hostage at Iperoig in Tupi territory, José de Anchieta composes De Beata Virgine Dei Matre (The Blessed Virgin Mary), a devotional poem that is among the early accomplishments in Brazilian literature.
April 3 – From the Electoral Palatinate, Caspar Olevian reports to John Calvin that the Heidelberg Catechism will be ready "by next market day". The contributors, including Olevian, Zacharias Ursinus, and Calvin himself, are not mentioned in print, "so that the Germans would not refuse to read it."
May – The Ottoman poet and historian Mustafa Âlî accepts a post in Aleppo Eyalet. On their way there they visit their mentor, Ramazanoğlu Piri Mehmet Paşa, in Adana.
June 27 – Gómez Suárez de Figueroa fails to return to their native Peru from Seville. After November, they begin signing their name Garcilaso de la Vega, a step toward Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, their literary signature.
August – Michel de Montaigne writes a letter to their father describing the death of their friend Étienne de La Boétie.
c. September/November – In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł commissions the Brest Bible from various translators, as the first complete translation into Polish. It becomes the standard edition for the Polish Lutheran and Reformed churches.
November 5 – Outside Suceava, Moldavia, Prince Iacob Heraclid, a Renaissance humanist, is lynched by crowds after a siege; the rival pretender, Ștefan Tomșa, probably delivers the first blow.
December – Primož Trubar of the South Slavic Bible Institute draws up a plan to sustain the Reformation in Italy with translations from Martin Luther.
December 4 – The closure of the Council of Trent marks the official start of the Counter-Reformation and encouragement of artistic Mannerism, which sometimes extended to literature. Though its full impact is delayed to 1587, it is visible in the Republic of Venice: by 1567, most books put out by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari are devotional.
At Basel in the Old Swiss Confederacy, the Dutch physician Johann Weyer publishes De praestigiis daemonum, with its rationalist interpretation of witchcraft. It proposes that accused witches are "deluded victims" rather than instruments of the Devil. Though rejected by "witch-hunters", De praestigiis sells well and will inspire Reginald Scot's refutation of magic. Also in Basel, Pietro Perna prints Bernardino Ochino's Dialogi XXX (Thirty Dialogues) criticizing the Radical Reformation. Their apparent preaching of polygamy is used against them by the Daig, causing them and their family to be banished from the city.
John Foxe's Actes and Monuments, known later than Foxe's Book of Martyrs, becomes "the most influential book" of the Elizabethan era "upon the formation of English Protestant identity and nationhood."
Printing is brought to Goa and Portuguese India, probably by the Society of Jesus, producing Garcia de Orta's Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India. With its rhyming preface by Luís de Camões, it is "the third [book] in a European language to be printed in Asia."
The future John of the Cross is tonsured a Carmelite at Medina del Campo in the Crown of Castile.
In the Kingdom of Poland, Stanisław Orzechowski publishes Rozmowa, albo Dyjalog około egzekucyjej polskiej korony (Conversation, or a Dialogue about Government of the Polish Crown), with allegorical engravings and designs resembling hieroglyphs. It defends the Catholic Church in Poland as an ideal political model, so marking Orzechowski's own transition from Lutheranism.

The United States Ambassador to Sweden () serves as the official diplomatic representative of the President and the Government of the United States of America to the King and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden. Diplomatic relations between Sweden and the United States began with the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1783. Sweden received its first U.S. resident minister in 1814, but in 1818, the senior U.S. diplomat again became the chargé d'affaires. In 1854, the senior American diplomat in Sweden again became the minister resident. From 1814 to 1905 the United States Chief of Mission in Sweden also represented United States interests with respect to Norway, as Norway was aligned with Sweden during this period in the Union between Sweden and Norway.
The contemporary tendency of American presidents is to appoint fundraisers or prominent campaign supporters to the ambassador's post in Sweden, rather than promoting career members of the United States Foreign Service. The current ambassador is Erik Ramanathan, who presented their credentials on January 20, 2022.
Residence
Since the 1930s, the ambassador is resident in the ambassadorial residence, Villa Åkerlund, of the United States Embassy in Diplomatstaden, Stockholm.

Hungary was represented by Csézy in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with the song "Candlelight".
Before Eurovision
Eurovíziós Dalverseny 2008: Magyarországi döntő
Eurovíziós Dalverseny 2008: Magyarországi döntő was the Hungarian national selection which selected the Hungarian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. The show took place on 8 February 2008 at Pólus Center's Fortuna Stúdió in Budapest, hosted by Éva Novodomszky and Levente Harsányi and was broadcast on m1.
Format
The competition featured fifteen entries where the Hungarian entry for Belgrade was selected by a four-member judging panel and votes from the public. Each judge assigned scores to each entry ranging from 1 (the lowest score) to 10 (the highest score) immediately after the artist(s) conclude their performance and the sum of all the jury scores created an overall ranking from which points from 1 (lowest) to 15 (highest) were distributed. The public submitted their vote via telephone or an SMS and the overall ranking of the entries was also assigned points from 1 to 15. The summation of the judges scores and the public vote determined the winning entry.
The judging panel consisted of:
Miklós Malek – Ferenc Erkel award-winning composer and conductor
László Benko – rock musician and composer
Eszter Horgas – flautist
Balázs Lévai – MTV programme editor
Competing entries
Artists and composers were able to submit their applications and entries for the competition between 10 November 2007 and 12 December 2007. Competing artists were required to either hold Hungarian citizenship or be able to speak Hungarian fluently. In addition, only artists that had a valid contract with a record company/professional management and that had released an album were eligible to compete. Artists were also required to submit their songs in both English and Hungarian. After the submission deadline had passed, 30 entries were received by the broadcaster. A four-member preselection jury selected fifteen entries for the competition. The jury consisted of Miklós Malek, László Benko, Eszter Horgas and Balázs Lévai. The competing artists were announced on 14 January 2008.
Final
The final took place on 8 February 2008 where fifteen entries competed. "Szívverés" performed by Csézy was selected as the winner via the combination of votes from a jury and a public vote submitted through telephone and SMS. Adrien Szekeres and Csézy were both tied with 29 points but since Csézy received the most votes from the public they were declared the winner. In addition to the performances of the competing entries, guest performers included 1994 Hungarian Eurovision entrant Friderika Bayer, 1997 Hungarian Eurovision entrants V.I.P., 2005 Hungarian Eurovision entrants Nox and 2007 Hungarian Eurovision entrant Magdi Rúzsa.
Preparation
Following Csézy's win at the national selection, the English version of "Szívverés", titled "Candlelight", was released on 11 February 2008.
At Eurovision
In previous years, if a country placed in the top 10 countries in the final they automatically qualified to the final of the next contest. Had this rule remained for the 2008 contest, Hungary would have directly qualified for the final. However, a change in rules due to the large intake of countries participating in the contest meant that only five countries, the host country and the Big Four countries, would automatically qualify to the final. As such, Hungary were forced to compete in one of the two semi-finals of the 2008 contest in Serbia.
They competed in the second semi-final on May 22, performing fifteenth. They placed nineteenth and last with six points, getting four points from Serbia, one from Georgia and one from Denmark.
Gábor Gundel Takács provided commentary on Hungarian television and Éva Novodomszky was the Hungarian spokesperson.

Dong Tonghe or Tung Tung-ho (; October 12, 1911 – June 18, 1963) was a Chinese linguist particularly well known for their contributions to Chinese historical phonology.
Born in Kunming, Yunnan, China, Dong moved to Beijing at the age of four or five when their father was given a job at the Palace Museum.
In 1930 they participated in dialect surveys of Yunnan and Sichuan under the direction of Yuen Ren Chao.
In 1932, they were admitted to the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University. Their thesis concerned issues in the Qieyun. In 1937, Dong was admitted to the Institute of History and Philology.
They were one of the editors of the dialect survey report for Hubei, published in 1948 based on fieldwork done in 1936.
In 1949, Dong moved to Taiwan with the Institute of History and Philology and became a part-time professor of Chinese at National Taiwan University. From 1954 to 1955 they were a visiting scholar at the Harvard-Yenching Institute. In 1959, Dong was also a visiting professor at the University of Washington. From 1958 until their death in 1963, they focussed on the Austronesian languages of the Taiwanese aborigines.

Libertarian conservatism, also referred to as conservative libertarianism and conservatarianism, is a political philosophy that combines conservatism and libertarianism, representing the libertarian wing of conservatism and vice versa.
Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring laissez-faire classical liberalism, but harnesses this to a belief in a more socially conservative philosophy emphasizing authority, morality and duty. Originating in the United States, libertarian conservatism prioritizes liberty, promoting free expression, freedom of choice and free-market capitalism to achieve conservative ends and rejects liberal social engineering.
Overview
Philosophy
In political science, libertarian conservatism is an ideology that combines the advocacy of economic and legal principles such as fiscal discipline, respect for contracts, defense of private property and free markets, fewer laws banning minor crimes, and the traditional conservative stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a laissez-faire and economically liberal capitalist society with social tenets such as the importance of religion and the value of religious morality through a framework of limited, constitutional, representative government. For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of liberal individualism and the demand for personal freedom. According to Andrew Gilbert, conservative parties such as the British Conservative Party and the American Republican Party hold a significant libertarian conservative wing, although Gilbert argues that "it is questionable to what extent conservatism and libertarianism are compatible". According to Mark A. Graber, libertarian conservatives are "philosophically consistent liberal legal individualists".
In 1998, George Wescott Carey edited Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate, a book which contains essays that Carey describes as representing "the tension between liberty and morality" and "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies". For Brian Farmer, "Libertarianism is a form of Conservatism often considered separate from the more mainstream conservative ideologies, partially because it is a bit more extreme, and partially because Libertarians often separate themselves from other forms of more mainstream Conservatism".
In 2004, Thomas DiLorenzo wrote that libertarian conservative constitutionalists believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the United States Constitution. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing that "[t]he fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". DiLorenzo further wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the American Civil War overthrew the Constitution of 1787.
In 2006, Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. According to Hultberg, "[t]he true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". They said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by neoconservatism, "by the very enemies it was formed to fight—Fabians, New Dealers, welfarists, progressives, globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".
Economics
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of free-market capitalism, advocating minimal to no government interference in the market. A number of libertarian conservatives favor Austrian School economics and are critical of fiat money. Libertarian conservatives also support wherever possible privatizing services traditionally run or provided by the government, from airports and air traffic control systems to toll roads and toll booths. Libertarian conservatism advocates economic freedom in the product and capital markets and consumption whilst excluding collective action, collective bargaining and labor organization in general.
History
In the 1950s, Frank Meyer, a prominent contributor to the National Review, called their own combination of libertarianism and conservatism fusionism.
In a 1975 interview with Reason, California Governor Ronald Reagan appealed to libertarians when they stated to "believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". Ron Paul was one of the first elected officials in the nation to support Reagan's presidential campaign and actively campaigned for Reagan in 1976 and 1980. However, Ron Paul quickly became disillusioned with the Reagan administration's policies after Reagan's election in 1980 and later recalled being the only Republican to vote against Reagan budget proposals in 1981, aghast that "in 1977, Jimmy Carter proposed a budget with a $38 billion deficit, and every Republican in the House voted against it. In 1981, Reagan proposed a budget with a $45 billion deficit—which turned out to be $113 billion—and Republicans were cheering their great victory. They were living in a storybook land". Ron Paul expressed their disgust with the political culture of both major parties in a speech delivered in 1984 upon resigning from the House of Representatives to prepare for a failed run for the Senate and eventually apologized to their libertarian friends for having supported Reagan. By 1987, Ron Paul was ready to sever all ties to the Republican Party as explained in a blistering resignation letter. While affiliated with both Libertarian and Republican parties at different times, Ron Paul stated to have always been a libertarian at heart.
In the 1980s, libertarians such as Ron Paul and Murray Rothbard criticized President Reagan, Reaganomics and policies of the Reagan administration for, among other reasons, having turned the United States' big trade deficit into debt and the United States became a debtor nation for the first time since World War I under the Reagan administration. Rothbard argued that the presidency of Reagan has been "a disaster for libertarianism in the United States" and Ron Paul described Reagan themselves as "a dramatic failure".
Already a radical classical liberal and anti-interventionist strongly influenced by the Old Right, especially its opposition to the managerial state whilst being more unequivocally anti-war and anti-imperialist, Rothbard had become the doyen of libertarianism in the United States. After their departure from the New Left, with which they helped build for a few years a relationship with other libertarians, Rothbard had involved the segment of the libertarian movement loyal to them in an alliance with the growing paleoconservative movement, seen by many observers, libertarian and otherwise, as flirting with racism and social reaction. Suggesting that libertarians needed a new cultural profile that would make them more acceptable to socially and culturally conservative people, Rothbard criticized the tendency of proponents of libertarianism to appeal to "'free spirits,' to people who don't want to push other people around, and who don't want to be pushed around themselves" in contrast to "the bulk of Americans", who "might well be tight-assed conformists, who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity, kick out people with strange dress habits, etc." whilst emphasizing that this was relevant as a matter of strategy. Rothbard argued that the failure to pitch the libertarian message to Middle America might result in the loss of "the tight-assed majority".
In the 1990s, Rothbard, Lew Rockwell and others described their libertarian conservative views as paleolibertarianism. In an early statement of this position, Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker argued for a specifically Christian libertarianism. Later, Rockwell would no longer consider themselves a "paleolibertarian" and was "happy with the term libertarian". Those libertarians continued their opposition to "all forms of government intervention—economic, cultural, social, international" whilst upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. Paleolibertarians opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority". Rockwell later stated to have dropped that self-description because people confused it with paleoconservatism which libertarians such as Rockwell rejected. While distancing themselves from the paleolibertarian alliance strategy, Rockwell affirmed paleoconservatives for their "work on the immigration issue", maintaining that "porous borders in Texas and California" could be seen as "reducing liberty, not increasing it, through a form of publicly subsidized right to trespass".
In 2001, Edward Feser emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of liberty, privacy and ending the war on marijuana at the legal level without changing personal values. Defending the fusion of traditionalist conservatism with libertarianism and rejecting the view that libertarianism means support for a liberal culture, Feser implied that a central issue for those who share their viewpoint is "the preservation of traditional morality—particularly traditional sexual morality, with its idealization of marriage and its insistence that sexual activity be confined within the bounds of that institution, but also a general emphasis on dignity and temperance over self-indulgence and dissolute living".
Hans-Hermann Hoppe is a libertarian conservative, whose belief in rights of property owners to establish private covenant communities, from which homosexuals and political dissidents may be "physically removed", has been strongly criticised. Hoppe also garnered controversy due to their support for restrictive limits on immigration which critics argue is at odds with libertarianism. In Democracy: The God That Failed, first published in 2001, Hoppe argued that "libertarians must be conservatives". Hoppe acknowledged "the importance, under clearly stated circumstances, of discriminating against communists, democrats, and habitual advocates of alternative, non-family centered lifestyles, including homosexuals". In contrast to Walter Block, Hoppe argued that libertarianism need not be seen as requiring open borders and attributed "open border enthusiasm" to "egalitarianism". While defending "market anarchy" in preference to both, Hoppe has argued for the superiority of monarchy to democracy, maintaining that monarchs are likely to be better flight attendants of the territory they claim to own than democratic politicians, whose time horizons may be shorter.
Notable people
Richard Epstein, Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Albert Jay Nock, Richard Posner, Peter Schiff, Thomas Sowell, David Stockman and Walter E. Williams have been described as libertarian conservatives. Former Congressman Ron Paul and their son Senator Rand Paul have been described as combining conservative and libertarian small government ideas and showing how the Constitution of the United States defends the individual and most libertarian views.
Ivan Reitman, the director of Ghostbusters, described their political views as "conservative-slash-libertarian".

Secret Coders is a series of graphic novels that combines logic puzzles, basic programming instruction, and a story where a group of seventh graders uncover a secret coding school. The series is written by Gene Luen Yang, illustrated by Mike Holmes, and published by First Second Books.
About the Author
Gene Luen Yang, the author of the series, is a cartoonist. However, they majored in computer science when they were in college at U.C. Berkeley. Some of their non-cartoonist jobs included a few years of software developing and over fifteen years of high school teaching computer science in Oakland, California. Their books are based on their teaching techniques, and meant to be educational, fun, and accessible by all age levels. They wrote the book to inspire people to learn coding. Yang wrote the book in a similar way to how they taught their classes.
Structure of the Novels
Secret Coders is a series of 6 educational graphic novels. Each of the Secret Coders graphic novels has 3 chapters. The chapter “titles” are drawings of four-eyed binary birds, displaying the chapter number in binary with open and closed eyes. At the end of each chapter, there is a coding or binary challenge. At the end of each book, there is a coding challenge. The answer to the coding challenge is revealed at the beginning of the next book. The sixth and final book does not have a coding challenge at the end.
The beginning of the first book implies that the books are stories being told by the main character, Hopper. This is confirmed by the end of book six, where Hopper begins to tell the story to Eni.
All the books take place at Stately Academy
Graphic Novels
Secret Coders (2015)
This book is the first in the series and contains Chapters 1 - 3
In this book, the main characters are introduced. The readers get a sneak peek of Doctor One-Zero and Principal Dean, but for the most part the antagonists are not introduced.
Summary: With the help of the binary birds, Eni teaches Hopper binary. Then, Hopper and Eni find Little Guy and teach themselves some basic logo commands: Repeat, Forward, Right, Left, PU, and PD. At the end of the book, Josh joins Hopper and Eni. Mr. Bee confronts them and gives them a coding challenge (the end of book challenge).
Paths & Portals (2016)
This book is the second in the series and contains Chapters 4 -6.
Summary: In this book, Mr. Bee teaches the coders the EdAll (Edit All), Random, and Variable commands. Josh is revealed to be an amazing typist. There is also an example of a buggy program at the beginning of the book, which gets subsequently debugged. A list of logo's basic commands is on page 19, though many of them are not fully introduced and explained until later books, if at all. The rugby team, minor antagonists, are also introduced.
Programming concepts: random numbers

Main Characters
Hopper
Hopper is a twelve year old girl and the protagonist of the Secret Coders series. They just moved to their new middle school, Stately Academy.  They are in seventh grade.  They are an only child and their mom is the Mandarin teacher at Stately Academy. They began to play basketball after their dad, a huge basketball fan named Albert Gracie, disappeared. In the fifth book, Albert Gracie reappears and it is revealed that they were imprisoned by Doctor One-Zero and intoxicated with Green Pop. They become a coder after some lessons from Eni and Mr. Bee. Hopper is named after Grace Hopper. Them personality is also somewhat based on Grace Hopper (as with the name). Hopper is introduced to the reader in book 1.
Eni
Eni is a tall, African American basketball player. They have three older sisters, all basketball players. Their personality and appearance were inspired by Chris Bosh, an NBA star and coder. They teach Hopper binary and some basic coding. Eni is introduced to the reader in book 1.
Mr. Bee
Mr. Bee is the Stately Academy janitor with a secret past.  They are based on Seymour Papert, a computer scientist. In the second book, it is revealed that they were the founder of the Bee School, a computer science school that was all but abolished. A few classrooms and plenty of turtles from the Bee School are hidden beneath Stately Academy. After Hopper, Eni, and Josh hear that Mr. Bee was once a professor at the Bee School, they refer to them as Professor Bee. In book 5, it is revealed that they were originally named B Square, for they are from Flatland.  They are introduced to the reader in book 1, but their past is not known until book 2, and their far past is not known until book 5.
Dr. One-Zero
Dr. One-Zero's original name was Pascal Pasqual. They created Little Guy, and was a former student at the Bee School. They were the original creator of green pop, the substance that when drunk reprogrammed the drinker's brain to love the color green and only want to see the color green. Those that drink green pop can only say “Green!” (if they see the color green) and “Green?” (if they do not see the color green). They also made green mist, a vapor version of green pop, and ultraviolet mist, a vapor that makes you want to see ultraviolet light (which causes eternal desire, because humans can not see ultraviolet light).
Other Characters
Other characters include Josh, an award winningly fast typist, who, Starting in book two, uses the EdAll command to type up computer programs for Hopper and Eni. Little Guy is a robot officially called Pascal Junior after Dr. One-Zero or Pascal Pasqual, their original creator. Other turtles include Mini Guy, a tiny turtle; LightLight, the original Turtle of Light that Mr. Bee brought with them from Flatland; and BrightBright, the second Turtle of Light that the protagonists retrieve from Flatland.

Connections in the Novel
Logo
Logo is the programming language used for the turtles throughout the Secret Coders books. Some of the commands include Forward (moving the turtle forward the given number of steps), Right and Left (turning right and left, respectively, the given number of degrees), PU/Pen Up (move without drawing), PD/Pen Up (draw while moving), and Repeat (repeat all the commands inside the brackets the given number of times). Logo is the first coding language the author learned.
Binary
Binary, or base two, is used frequently throughout the books. For example, the four-eyed-robot-birds' eyes close and open depending on what base ten number they see. They convert it to binary and open their eyes for 1s and close them for 0s. For example, the number 9 is written all over the school because when the birds see this number, they convert it to binary (1001) and close their middle two eyes, appearing normal.
Flatland
In the fifth and sixth books, it becomes clear that the full series is based on the book Flatland. In the fifth book, it is revealed that the teacher/janitor, Mr. B, was named B Square when they lived in Flatland. B Square explains their life in Flatland, and mentions their brother, A Square, who came to Earth and wrote Flatland under another name. In the sixth book, the main characters Hopper, Eni, and Josh go to Flatland. Making the code to make a portal to Flatland is the challenge at the end of book five.

Two-Piece Reclining Figure: Points is a sculpture by Henry Moore, catalogued as LH 606, and created in 1969–70.
Editions
It was a bronze edition of 7; the artist's copy ("0/7") is in Kew Gardens in London, loaned by the Henry Moore Foundation another in the Hofgarten, Düsseldorf (illustrated), and one at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington D.C. The plaster model is at the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 2008, an example traveled to the New York Botanical Garden, and the Denver Botanic Gardens.
History
Among Moore's post war abstract bronzes, it is a part of the Two Piece Reclining Figure series. It can be read as one figure or two.
I did the first one in two pieces almost without intending to. But after I had done it, then the second one became a conscious idea. I realised what an advantage a separated two- piece composition could have in relating figures to landscape. Knees and breasts are mountains.
Once these two parts become separated you don't expect it to be a naturalistic figure; therefore you can justifiably make it look like a landscape or a rock. If it's a single figure, you can guess what it's going to be like. If it's in two pieces there's a bigger surprise, you have more unexpected views; therefore the special advantage over painting—of having the possibility of many different views—is more fully explored. The front view doesn't enable you to foresee the back view. As you move round it, the two parts overlap or they open up and there's space in between.
Reviews
A work like Two Piece Reclining Figures: Points, from 1969, has the feel that Moore aimed at — but didn't always achieve — of form as primal matter.

Where Are You Dying Tonight? is a 1981 novel by the French writer Michel Déon. Its French title is Un déjeuner de soleil, which literally means "a sun's breakfast" and is an expression for something short-lived. It tells the story of Stanislas Beren, a fictional 20th-century novelist, with excerpts from their novels and the events from their life that inspired them. An English translation by Julian Evans was published in 1983.
Reception
G. S. Bourdain of The New York Times called the book "highly literate" and wrote: "The story, which begins in 1925 and ends in 1977, is a delicious merging of narrative passages with excerpts from Stanislas' writings (footnotes included) and flashbacks to the events of their life that inspired those writings, not to mention numerous references to actual books, poems, paintings and people. ... The novel's citations of authors from Rimbaud to Maugham, descriptive phrases about paintings by artists from Giorgione to Picasso and mentions of real people from the period in which the book takes place are not only fun but also make one want to follow the Berens' trail through London and Paris to the art museums and trattorias of Venice. And the felicitous translation by Julian Evans never stumbles." Evans, the translator, wrote about the English-language edition: "The reviews it garnered were excellent; the sales made me want to weep."

Palestine sent a delegation to compete at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7–18 September 2016. This was the fifth time they had taken part in a Paralympic Games after its debut sixteen years prior at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. Palestine sent one athlete to Rio de Janeiro shot put thrower Husam Azzam, who was the flag bearer for Palestine at the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. They did not win their third Paralympic medal because they ranked eighth out of ten athletes with a throw of 6.34 metres in the men's shot put F53 competition.
Background
Palestine's first Olympic appearance was at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. It made its Paralympic debut four years later at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Australia. They have entered every Summer Paralympic Games since, making Rio de Janeiro its fifth appearance at a Summer Paralympiad. Entering the Rio Games, Palestine had won a total of three Paralympic medals in the sport of athletics. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Palestine sent a solitary athlete to compete in Rio de Janeiro, shot put thrower Husam Azzam. They were accompanied by chef de mission Ihsan Dikidk, Azzam's coach Mohammed Dahman, chairperson of the technical committee of the Palestinian Paralympic Committee Ali Al-Nizli and former secretary general of the committee Alaa Al-Shatli. Azzam was chosen to be the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Athletics
Husam Azzam's is disabled from contracting polio as an infant and losing the use of both their legs. They have had to use a wheelchair since and is classified as F53. Azzam was 40 years old at the time of the Rio Paralympics, and it was their fifth time competing at the Summer Paralympic Games; they won a medal at each of the 2000 and the 2004 Summer Paralympics. They qualified for the Games by using a wild card because they had not competed in any internationally sanctioned qualifying tournament in the three years leading up to the Games. The Palestinian Paralympic Committee negotiated and explained to the sports' governing body, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), about Azzam's restrictions of movement due to the constant closures of the Rafah Border Crossing and the Erez Crossing by Israeli authorities, which prevented them from attending three international training camps. This restricted them to staying in the Gaza Strip preparing for the Games with corroded shot put metal balls and on a sandy playground that did not meet international standards.
Nevertheless, following the intervention of the IPC, Azzam and their coach Mohammed Daham were permitted to leave the Gaza StrIp on 3 September and the pair arrived in Rio de Janeiro two days later. They said before the Paralympics that they were looking forward to competing at the Rio Games and they sought to claim a gold medal, "I look forward to the competition and challenge all the conditions and difficulties I will face and hope to win a gold medal for Palestine at the Paralympic Games, despite the difficulties I face as a Palestinian athlete living in the Gaza Strip." On 14 September, Azzam competed in the men's shot put F53 event. They recorded a season best throw of 6.34 metres, which ranked them eighth out of ten entered athletes.

Future Group firm Future Enterprises Ltd expects to raise around Rs 3,000 crore from selling its stake in the insurance business to pare debt, which may save the company from facing the rigour of the insolvency process, according to industry sources.
History
In May 2012, Future Group announced a 50.1% stake sale of its fashion chain Pantaloons to Aditya Birla Group in order to reduce its debt of around . To do so, the Pantaloons fashion segment was demerged from Pantaloons Retail India Ltd; the latter was then merged into another subsidiary—Future Value Retail Ltd—and later renamed Future Retail Ltd.
On 21 November 2014, Future Consumer Enterprises Limited acquired 98% from Actis Capital and other promoters. With that, Nilgiris is a fully-owned subsidiary of Future Consumer Enterprises Limited (FCEL).
In August 2019, Amazon acquired a 49% stake in Future Coupons, and indirectly obtained a 3.5% minority stake in Future Retail, ahead of an option to buy all or part of the promoters' holding in the company after three years.
In August 2020, it was announced that Reliance Retail had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter's retail and wholesale businesses, and also its logistics and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion. This takeover was approved by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).
Subsequently, the merger between Reliance Retail and Future Group was halted in October 2020, after Amazon filed a plea in the High Court for enforcement of EA awarded by Singapore International Arbitration Center. In August 2021, the Supreme Court of India upheld Amazon's plea to restrain the merger. In December 2021, the CCI withdrew its approval for Amazon's acquisition of a minority stake in Future Coupons, stating that Amazon had misled the regulator about the purpose of its investment in the Future Group company.

Dunkeswell Aerodrome is an airfield in East Devon, England. It is located approximately north of the town of Honiton and northeast of Exeter. It is a busy civilian airfield with a mix of light aircraft, microlights and parachuting.
Nearby () to the southwest is North Hill, an airstrip run by the local gliding club.
Dunkeswell Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P674) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Air Westward Limited). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use.
Dunkeswell Airfield Heritage Centre, is situated to one side of the large propeller memorial.
History
The airfield was opened in 1943, during the Second World War, as RAF Dunkeswell. The station was originally planned as a RAF Fighter Command, then a RAF Coastal Command airfield, but was transferred for use by American units.
It was first used by the American United States Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, 479th Antisubmarine Group, as a base of operations to fly antisubmarine missions over the Bay of Biscay using specialized B-24 Liberator bombers from August until November 1943.
In November the United States Army Air Forces turned over the antisubmarine mission to the United States Navy and its Liberators were reassigned to Navy Patrol Bomber Squadron VPB-103, Fleet Air Wing 7, which continued aerial antisubmarine operations from the station, the AAF aircraft being redesignated under the USN/USMC system of the time as PB4Y-1 Liberators. This was the first United States Navy unit to train with the RAF, later followed by VB-105 and VB-110. The Naval antisubmarine squadrons moved to RAF Upottery in November 1944.
With the departure of the Americans, the RAF used the airfield from August 1945 to April 1946 for ferrying aircraft to the Middle East by 16 Ferry Unit, RAF Transport Command. After September 1946 the station was put on care and maintenance status until the end of 1948, when it was sold by the Ministry of Defence.

The Magnificent Seven Elephants were seven bull elephants who lived in Kruger National Park in South Africa through the 1980s. They were so-named for the impressive 50 kg of ivory in their tusks.
In 1980, park management decided to promote the seven elephants to showcase their conservation accomplishments. A series of portraits were released by Paul Bosman along with several articles from the Park's Senior Researcher, Dr. Anthony Hall-Martin.
This sparked a public fascination with large elephants. When each of the seven died, their tusks and skulls were placed in a museum. After the tusks were exhibited in Olifants Rest Camp for a while, the Elephant Museum was opened in Letaba Rest Camp. Six of the elephant's tusks are exhibited there: Dzombo, Kambaku, Mafunyane, Ndlulamithi, Shawu en Shingwedzi. Those of the seventh, João, were unfortunately stolen in 1984 and never found.
Dzombo (c.1935–1983)
Dzombo is named after Dzombo Spring in the Shingwedzi River, located in the northern area of the park. They were usually found in that section of the park, most often in the Shawu Valley between the Tsendze, Letaba, and Shingwedzi Rivers. The name Dzombo is comes from the Tsonga word dzombolo which means "to wait for something approaching slowly."
Dzombo died in October 1983 at the age of 48 or 50. Killed in a hail of AK-47 bullets, Dzombo was the only one of the Magnificent Seven killed by poachers. The poachers were extracting Dzombo's tusks near the Dzombyane watering hole when the ranger Ampie Espag intercepted them, at which point they fled and left the tusks behind.
Dzombo's left tusk was 255 cm long, 50 cm in circumference at its base, and 55.8 kg in weight. Their right one was 237 cm long, 51 cm in base circumference, and 56.8 kg in weight.
João (c. 1939–c.2000)
João was first seen near a windmill of the same name in the Shingwedzi Basin. They were a placid elephant often found near the Shingwedzi Rest Camp. In 1982, they were attacked by poachers but survived the AK-47 fire.
Their magnificent tusks were measured when they were sedated for radio banding. Unfortunately, both tusks broke 20 cm from the lip line in 1984. The cause is unknown and the resulting ivory was never found. João presumably died by 2000, but their fate is unknown.
João boasted a left tusk that was 271 cm long, 51 cm in base circumference, and 55 kg in weight. Their right tusk was 250 cm long, 51 cm in base circumference, and 45 kg in weight.
Kambaku (c. 1930-1985)
Kambaku is the Tsonga word for an old bull elephant, a token of great respect for the majestic animal. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Kambaku was always a loner. They were 55 years old when they were in substantial pain from a bullet wound. They were shot near the crossing of the Crocodile River when they grazed on a nearby sugarcane plantation. When they could no longer walk, they were euthanised by the ranger Lynn van Rooyen from the Lower Sabie rest camp.
Kambaku was one of the best-known bulls in the park. They crossed a large territory between the Timbavati Game Reserve and the Crocodile Bridge Rest Camp, and usually spent the wet season up north. Several visitors to the park took them down because they were easily recognizable. They had no tail hair and easily identifiable trunk marks. Their tusks were precise mirror images of one another.
The left tusk was 259 cm long, 51 cm in base circumference, and weight 63.2 kg in weight. The right tusk was 265 cm long, 52 cm in circumference, and 64 kg in weight.
Mafunyane (c. 1926-1983)
Mafunyane was the best-known member of the Magnificent Seven. Their Tsonga name meant "the irritated one," based on the elephant's temper and impatience with people. They were a shy animal rarely seen by the public, since they avoided the major tourist routes.
Mafunyane's long, straight tusks dragged on the ground as they moved. They were a small elephant, however (only 327 cm high at the shoulder), and their tusks were shorter than most of the other Magnificent Seven's. the tusks had an oval circumference, making them look heavier than they really were.
The most unique characteristic of Mafunyane was the 10-cm-wide, 40-cm-deep gap in their skull. The hole stretched into their nostril, and they could therefore breathe and consumer rainwater through it. The origin of the gash is unknown, but it is believed to have been sustained during a fight with another bull whose tusk pierced the Mafunyane's skull.
Mafunyane died in 1983 of natural causes. They were around 57 years old. Their body was found near the Tari River, northwest of Shingwedzi, around 3 or 4 weeks after their death.
Both Mafunyane's tusks were 251 cm long, 48 cm in base circumference, and 55.1 kg in weight.
Ndlulamithi (c. 1927–1985)
Ndulamithi's name is the Tsonga word for "higher than the trees." This elephant is taller than most of the other Magnificent Seven at 340–345 cm high at the shoulder.
They were an aggressive, wild elephant who often charged but was seldom seen. They spent most of their time in the Shingwedzi area near the river. Their right tusk shrunk shorter at one point, leaving their left tusk curving underneath the right.
Ndlulamithi died of natural causes in 1985. They were found in the Shangoni Gate area by the ranger Paul Zway.
Their left tusk was 287 cm long, 48.5 cm in base circumference, and 64.6 kg in weight. Their right tusk was 273 cm long, 48 cm in base circumference, and 57.2 kg in weight.
Shawu (c. 1926–1986)
Shawu is named for the Shawu Valley near Shingwedzi, where they spent most of their time. They often roamed as far south as the Letaba River; they were known for moving slowly and sometimes took 6 months to move from north to south. They were an agreeable bull who showed no fear of people or vehicles. With a shoulder height of 340 cm, Shawu was one of the largest of the seven. In Afrikaans, Sharu was known as "Groot Haaktand" ("Great Hook-Tusk"), in reference to their tusks' shape.
Shawu died in October 1986 of natural causes when they were around 60 years old. In their last days, their movements were monitored by radio band, and they were eventually found near the hill known as Kostinia, in the Shawu Valley.
Shawu's tusks are the longest on record in South Africa. The left tusk was 317 cm long, 45 cm in base circumference, and 52.6 kg in weight. Their right tusk was 305 cm long, 45 cm in base circumference, and 50.8 kg in weight.
Shingwedzi (c. 1934-1981)
Shingwedzi is named for the river and rest camp by which they spent the last years of their life. They were a pleasant, peaceful elephant accustomed to vehicles. They spent most of their time under the sycamores along the Shingwedzi River near the rest camp.
Shingwedzi died of natural causes on January 16, 1981, when they were around 65 years old. They collapsed under a sycamore on the southern bank of the Shingwedzi River. Their main tusk was buried deep under the ground where they were found.
Shingwedzi's secondary tusk wore shorter because they used it more regularly. That tusk, the left one, was 207 cm long and 47.2 kg in weight. Their right tusk, the main one, was 264 cm long, 48 cm in circumference, and 58.1 kg in weight.

The 1993–94 season was Dynamo Dresden's third season in the Bundesliga. They finished in 13th place, to date their best performance since German reunification. After a slow start, they went on a 10 match unbeaten run during the middle of the season, and won three of their last five games to finish well clear of the relegation zone. Dynamo were masters of the 1–0 win, thanks in part to loan signing Marek Penksa (all three of their goals were winners in such matches), and top scorer Olaf Marschall, who'd been signed from Admira Wacker during pre-season.
Dynamo also achieved their best ever result in the DFB-Pokal, beating Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen before bowing out to Werder Bremen in the semi-final.

State Route 678 (SR 678) is a short north–south state highway located in southeast Ohio. Entirely situated within Laurel Township in Hocking County, SR 678 has its southern terminus at SR 374 approximately southwest of the hamlet of Gibisonville, and its northern terminus is at SR 180 nearly northeast of Gibisonville. SR 678 provides a shorter alternative for traffic using SR 374 en route from Hocking Hills State Park up to U.S. Route 33 (US 33) at Rockbridge, in conjunction with SR 180.
Route description
State Route 678 begins at a T-intersection with SR 374 in Hocking County's Laurel Township. Starting out, the highway weaves its way in a northerly and easterly fashion, passing primarily through a forested landscape, with spaces of open grass and the occasional home also appearing alongside the highway. Turning to the east, SR 678 passes through the small hamlet of Gibisonville, where the highway is lined by a number of homes and a church. This town is also where SR 678 intersects Cream Ridge Road. Departing Gibsonville, the state route turns to the east-northeast, intersects Dunlap Road, then bends to the northeast. At Mount Olive Road, SR 678 turns back to the east-northeast, passing a succession of homes and through more open space, before curving to the north at the Hocking County Road 9 intersection. From here, SR 678 weaves through heavy woods, bending back to the northeast into an area of open space, prior to turning back to the north one final time before arriving at its terminal intersection at SR 180.
No portion of SR 678 is included within the National Highway System.
History
SR 678 was designated in 1937. Originally, the highway was shown on the official state highway map as traveling along its current alignment between SR 374] and SR 180, then traveling along SR 180 west a short distance, and following what is now SR 374 from SR 180 to US 33 near Rockbridge. By 1938, however, SR 678 was shown in the form that it currently exists as today, with the remaining portions of what was identified as SR 678 on the prior year's map becoming a solo stretch of SR 180 and an extension of SR 374, respectively.

The French Defence Central Health Service ("Service de Santé des Armées" or SSA) is responsible for medical and sanitary support of the French military and of all institutions placed under the authority of the French Ministry of Defence. It is a joint service, and its central administration (Direction Centrale du Service de Santé des Armées, DCSSA) is under the direct control of the Chief of the defence staff (chef d'état-major des armées (CEMA)).
Its significant presence on French territory ensures adequate support for French operations in overseas theatres. It provides hospital care services, administers medicals for military personnel, and gives expertise in disease prevention, and medical, dental, pharmaceutical, paramedical and veterinary research and education.
Physicians and chemists receive initial training in Lyon and in Bordeaux until 2011. Then, they are sent to the Val de Grâce Hospital in Paris for applied training. Dentists and vets are recruited in the civilian labour market. The service also includes administrative and technical officers (OCTASSA), nurses (male and female) and paramedical staff.
History
The health services of the French army and navy were set up by Louis XIV with the 17 January 1708 edict which established royal doctors and surgeons offices.
During The French Revolution (1789–1799) and the Napoleonic Empire (1804–1814), changes were required due to successive mobilisations. Military hospitals were then set up in religious buildings such as the Val-de-Grâce church in Paris.
In 1882, the French Parliament gave the military health services a degree of independence. Subsequently, eight hospitals, two schools (in Lyon and Bordeaux), as well as research and sanitary supply agencies were gradually acquired.
In 1890, the Military Medical Schools at Bordeaux and Lyon opened. Bordeaux educated for the Navy and colonial troops, while Lyon educated for the Army and the new Air Force.
In 1962, a central management of the military health services was established. In 1968, all of the military health services (Navy, Air Force, Army, Gendarmerie, etc.) merged to form a single joint defence health system.
On July 2, 2011, the Military School of Medicine (ESA) was established as part of a rationalisation of the armed forces, meaning the closure of Bordeaux, making Lyon the only school of military institution providing the first six years of medical and pharmacist training in the armed forces. The ESA inherits the traditions of both schools.
Notable characters in the history of the French military health services include:
Baron Pierre-François Percy (1754–1825), surgeon-in-chief during the Revolution and the Empire;
Dominique Jean Larrey (1766–1842), father of emergency medicine;
Louis Jacques Bégin (1793–1859), surgeon of the First Empire and to the second president of the Academy of Medicine in 1847;
Robert Picqué (1877–1927), pioneer of medical transport by air;
Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran (1845–1922), won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1907 for discovering that malaria is caused by a protozoan;
Henri Laborit (1914–1995), surgeon, discoverer of neuroleptics, neurobiologist ... ;
Valérie André, a pioneer in medical evacuation by helicopter during the Indochina War.
Missions

The AUT.18 was a prototype fighter aircraft developed in Italy by Aeronautica Umbra shortly before the outbreak of World War II. It was designed in 1934 by Felice Trojani, who at that time was collaborating with Umberto Nobile on the Arctic flights of the airships Norge and Italia. The aircraft's designation came from initials of the manufacturer, the surname of the designer, and the aircraft's wing area (18 m²), the sole prototype receiving the serial no. M.M.363.

Born from the same Regia Aeronautica requirement that spawned the Caproni-Vizzola F.5, FIAT G.50, Macchi C.200, Meridionali Ro 51 and Reggiane Re 2000 fighters, the A.U.T.18 flew for the first time on 22 April 1939, powered by a Fiat A.80 R.C.41 radial engine. The fighter had an all-metal stressed-skin structure, covered in duralumin, featuring an inwardly-retracting undercarriage and retractable tail-wheel and was armed with two Breda-SAFAT machine-guns mounted in the wings just outboard of the undercarriage.
Flight trials proved disappointing and lagged behind the other fighters in Progetto R - the modernisation (riammodernamento) of the Regia Aeronautica. With no production orders forthcoming, despite the prototype being returned to the Umbra factory at Foligno for modifications on 20 February 1940 and a second flight test series from 5 November 1940, no improvement was demonstrated over fighters already in production so the A.U.T.18 was abandoned.
Operational history
After delivery to the Regia Aeronautica on 5 November 1940 the fate of the prototype is not known, possibly being transferred to Germany for evaluation, it was also rumoured to have been captured by British forces, but it is more likely that it was destroyed in a raid after its transfer to Orvieto.

The men's 79 kg (173.8 lbs) Light-Contact category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the fifth heaviest of the male Light-Contact tournaments falling between middleweight and light heavyweight when compared to Low-Kick and K-1's weight classes. There were twenty-three men from three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) taking part in the competition. Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Light-Contact rules.
Owing to the unequal number of fighters not suitable for a thirty-two-man tournament, nine of the contestants had byes through to the second round. The tournament gold medalist was the Hungarian Zoltan Dancso who won gold by defeating the German Stefan Bücker by split decision. By virtue of reaching the semi finals, Slovak Martin Navratil and Poland's Robert Matyja won bronze medals.

NETVC was the name given to a planned royalty-free video codec that was intended to be developed in the former Internet Video Codec working group of the IETF. It was intended to provide a royalty-free alternative to industry standards such as H.264/AVC and HEVC that have required licensing payments for many uses. The chairs of the working group were Matthew Miller of Outer Planes and Mo Zanaty of Cisco Systems.
A list of criteria to be met by the new video standard was produced in April 2020 as Informational RFC 8761, and the working group was closed.
Concept
The October 2015 basic draft requirements for NETVC were support for a bit depth of 8-bits to 10-bits per sample, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 4:4:4 YUV, low coding delay capability, feasible real time decoder/encoder software implementations, temporal scalability, and error resilience tools. The October 2015 optional draft requirements for NETVC included support for a bit depth of up to 16-bits per sample, 4:2:2 chroma subsampling, RGB video, auxiliary channel planes, high dynamic range, and parallel processing tools.
History
On March 24, 2015, Xiph.org's Daala codec was presented to the IETF as a candidate for NETVC. Daala coding techniques have been proposed to the IETF for inclusion into NETVC.
On July 22, 2015, Cisco Systems' Thor video codec was presented to the IETF as a candidate for their NETVC video standard. Thor is being developed by Cisco Systems and uses some Cisco elements that are also used by HEVC. The Constrained Low-Pass Filter (CLPF) and motion compensation that are used in Thor were tested with Daala.
As of July 2015, in addition to Xiph and Cisco, there were also other participants involved in the project.
At IETF meeting 101 in March 2018, xvc was presented by Divideon as another candidate. Thor developer Steinar Midtskogen confirmed that a subset of xvc that Divideon considered royalty-free had better compression than Thor at comparable complexity settings. It was agreed at that time to pause physical meetings of the working group to see how the market for royalty-free video formats further developed, given that the teams behind several of the format candidates that had been presented had chosen to join the AV1 standard development initiative of the Alliance for Open Media consortium, which had similar goals.
After publishing RFC 8761 "Video Codec Requirements and Evaluation Methodology" in April 2020, the Internet Video Codec working group was closed.
Schedule
The planned schedule for the development of NETVC was:
April 2018: Informational document on requirements and evaluation criteria.
July 2018: Informational document on test results, initial codec specification and reference implementation.
December 2018: Standards documents on codec specification and storage format specification.

The word hobbit was used by J. R. R. Tolkien as the name of a race of small humanoids in their fantasy fiction, the first published being The Hobbit in 1937. The Oxford English Dictionary, which added an entry for the word in the 1970s, credits Tolkien with coining it. Since then, however, it has been noted that there is prior evidence of the word, in a 19th-century list of legendary creatures. In 1971, Tolkien stated that they remembered making up the word himself, admitting that there was nothing but their "nude parole" to support the claim that they were uninfluenced by such similar words as hobgoblin. Their choice may have been affected on their own admission by the title of Sinclair Lewis's 1922 novel Babbitt. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey has pointed out several parallels, including comparisons in The Hobbit, with the word "rabbit".
Use by Tolkien
Proposed etymology
By Tolkien's own account, the coining of the name hobbit was a spontaneous flash of intuition. When they were busy grading examination papers, the word popped into their mind, not in isolation but as part of an entire sentence, which was to become the incipit of The Hobbit, "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."
Tolkien etymologized the name hobbit as the regular Modern English outcome of a hypothetical Old English *hol-bytla "hole builder". Within the linguistic fiction of The Lord of the Rings, the English etymology of Old English hol-bytlan → Modern English hobbit is the supposed translation of an "original" etymology of Rohirric kud-dukan → Westron kuduk.
Tolkien's statements
On 16 January 1938, shortly after the original release of The Hobbit a letter by a Habit in the English paper The Observer asked if Tolkien's Hobbits were modelled after "'little furry men' seen in Africa by natives and … at least one scientist", and also referenced an old fairy tale called The Hobbit from 1904, but Tolkien denied using these sources as inspiration, and no trace of the African Hobbits or the fairy tale collection was ever found. Tolkien replied to this letter with:
"I do not remember anything about the name and inception of the hero… I have no waking recollection of furry pigmies (in book or moonlight); nor of any Hobbit bogey in print by 1904. I suspect that the two hobbits are accidental homophones, and am content that they are not synonymous. And I protest that my hobbit did not live in Africa, and was not furry, except about the feet. Nor indeed was they a rabbit…."
Tolkien also acknowledged the possible unconscious connection to others' writings, particularly those of Sinclair Lewis, who wrote the novel Babbitt in 1922. In a 1966 correspondence with Professor Harry Bauer of the University of Washington, Tolkien wrote, "...I now wonder whether Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt had not some part in the invention of this name: hobbit. I read all of Sinclair Lewis's works."
In 1970 the Oxford Dictionary wrote to Professor Tolkien asking for the origins of the word, as they wished to include 'Hobbit' in the dictionary. Tolkien replied:
"For the moment this is held up, because I am having the matter of the etymology: 'Invented by J. R. R. Tolkien': investigated by experts. I knew that the claim was not clear, but I had not troubled to look into it, until faced by the inclusion of hobbit in the Supplement."
In the event Hobbit was fully ascribed to Tolkien, as no earlier source was found.
In 1971 Tolkien once again referred to their "invention":
"The Ox. E. D. has in preparation of its Second Supplement got to Hobbit, which it proposes to include together with its progeny: hobbitry, -ish, etc. I have had, therefore, to justify my claim to have invented the word. My claim rests really on my 'nude parole' or unsupported assertion that I remember the occasion of its invention (by me); and that I had not then any knowledge of Hobberdy, Hobbaty, Hobberdy Dick etc. (for 'house-sprites')†; and that my 'hobbits' were in any case of wholly dissimilar sort, a diminutive branch of the human race.
"† I have now! Probably more than most other folk; and find myself in a v. tangled wood—the clue to which is, however, the belief in incubi and 'changelings'. Alas! one conclusion is that the statement that hobgoblins were 'a larger kind' is the reverse of the original truth. (The statement occurs in the preliminary note on Runes devised for the paperback edition, but now included by A & U in all edns.)"
Possible inspirations
Hob-beings
The name hobbit for a diminutive legendary creature fits into a category of English words in hob- for such beings, based on the Middle English hobbe. These include hob, hobby, hobgoblin, Hobberdy Dick, Hobberdy, Hobbaty, hobbidy, Hobley, hobbledehoy, hobble, hobi, hobyn (small horse), hobby horse (perhaps from Hobin), Hobby (nickname for Robert), hobyah, Hob Lantern. This theory was reinforced when in 1977 the Oxford English Dictionary announced that it had found the source that it supposed Tolkien to have used: J. Hardy's 1895 The Denham Tracts, Volume 2, which stated that "The whole earth was overrun with ghosts, boggles ... hobbits, hobgoblins." The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the list was, however, of ghostly creatures without bodies, nothing like Tolkien's solid flesh-and-blood hobbits.
Rabbit
Shippey notes an additional connection, with rabbit, something that Tolkien "emphatically rejected", although the word appears in The Hobbit in other characters' opinions of Bilbo in several places. Bilbo compares themselves to a rabbit when they are with the eagle that carries him; the eagle, too, tells Bilbo not to be "frightened like a rabbit". The giant bear-man Beorn teases Bilbo and jokes that "little bunny is getting nice and fat again", while the dwarf Thorin shakes Bilbo "like a rabbit".
Shippey writes that rabbit is not a native English species, but was deliberately introduced in the 13th century, and has become accepted as a local wild animal. Shippey compares this "situation of anachronism-cum-familiarity" with the lifestyle of the hobbit, giving the example of smoking "pipeweed". They argue that Tolkien did not want to write "tobacco", as it did not arrive until the 16th century, so Tolkien invented a calque made of English words.
Donald O'Brien notes, too, that Aragorn's description of Frodo's priceless mithril mail-shirt, "here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an elven-princeling in", is a "curious echo" of the English nursery rhyme "To find a pretty rabbit-skin to wrap the baby bunting in."
Evidence of earlier use
The only source known today that makes reference to hobbits in any sort of historical context is the Denham Tracts by Michael Aislabie Denham. More specifically, it appears in the Denham Tracts, edited by James Hardy, (London: Folklore Society, 1895), vol. 2, the second part of a two-volume set compiled from Denham's publications between 1846 and 1859. The text contains a long list of sprites and bogies, based on an older list, the Discovery of Witchcraft, dated 1584, with many additions and a few repetitions.
The term hobbit is listed in the context of "boggleboes, bogies, redmen, portunes, grants, hobbits, hobgoblins, brown-men, cowies, dunnies".
Tolkien researcher Mark T. Hooker catalogs a number of words with a silhouette similar to hobbit, including:
Hooker fails to find any of them "an unambiguous source for the Hobbits of Middle-earth".
In the December 2003 Oxford English Dictionary newsletter, the following appears:
"4. hobbit — J. R. R. Tolkien modestly claimed not to have coined this word, although the Supplement to the OED credited them with the invention of it in the absence of further evidence. It seems, however, that Tolkien was right to be cautious. It has since turned up in one of those 19th-century folklore journals, in a list of long-forgotten words for fairy-folk or little people. It seems likely that Tolkien, with their interest in folklore, read this and subconsciously registered the name, reviving it many years later in their most famous character. [Editor's note: although revision of the OED's entry for hobbit will of course take this evidence for earlier use into account, it does not yet appear in the online version of the entry.]"
As of 8 Nov 2012 the entry "has not yet been fully updated" in OED Online version September 2012.
Proprietary status
In 1968 United Artists acquired film and related merchandising rights to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Saul Zaentz bought the merchandising rights in 1976, vested in the Saul Zaentz Company (SZC; trade name "Middle-earth Enterprises", formerly "Tolkien Enterprises"). SZC registered trademarks in various product categories for names related to elements of the novels.
The 1970s role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons has humanoid races approximating Tolkien's. The halfling race was called "hobbit" until changed after a 1977 lawsuit by Tolkien Enterprises in the run-up to the release of the animated film The Lord of the Rings. For the same reason, Dungeons & Dragons "ents" were renamed treants; on the other hand elf, orc, and dwarf races were not renamed. Although the word halfling is used in The Lord of the Rings as an exonym of hobbit, it is not proprietary to Tolkien. Later fantasy works have also used halfling in a similar sense.
In 2008 SZC won a World Intellectual Property Organization case against a cybersquatter for control of the domain name and typosquat .
In 2012 Warner Bros. released The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in association with SZC. To coincide with the release, a New Zealand scientist planned a public lecture on Homo floresiensis, an extinct human-like species discovered in 2003 and unofficially nicknamed "the hobbit" after its 2004 publication, because of its small stature. SZC refused permission to use the word "hobbit" in publicising the lecture. The same year, The Asylum tried to release a mockbuster film with the title Age of the Hobbits. SZC and Warner sued, alleging Asylum's title was confusingly similar and violated its trademarks on the word "hobbit". Asylum claimed that its film was about Homo floresiensis, "uniformly referred to as 'Hobbits' in the scientific community", and also cited the word hobbit'''s appearance in the Denham Tracts. The U.S. District Court said Asylum's evidence did not invalidate the trademark's distinctiveness and granted an injunction; Asylum's film was eventually released as Clash of the Empires.
Businesses to which SZC has sent cease-and-desist letters include the Hobbit Grille restaurant in Bonita Springs, Florida in 2007; The Hungry Hobbit café in Birmingham in 2011; a Scottish manufacturer of cylindrical timber lodges called "hobbit houses" in 2011; The Hobbit pub in Southampton in 2012; and an English wine importer called Giraffe and Hobbit in 2016. SZC offered a cheap copyright licence to the pub in response to online criticism of perceived excessive litigiousness. Hobbit Travel of Minnesota won a 2008 case against SZC on the ground of laches (unreasonable delay) as it had used the word "hobbit" in its name since 1976.

The Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation () was a self-governing student organization, representing multiple Beijing universities, and acting as the student protesters' principal decision-making body during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Student protesters founded the Federation in opposition to the official, government-supported student organizations, which they believed were undemocratic. Although the Federation made several demands of the government during the protests and organized multiple demonstrations in the Square, its primary focus was to obtain government recognition as a legitimate organization. By seeking this recognition, the Federation directly challenged the Chinese Communist Party's authority. After failing to achieve direct dialogue with the government, the Federation lost support from student protesters, and its central leadership role within the Tiananmen Square protests.
Origin
After former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Hu Yaobang's death on April 15, students mobilized spontaneously both to mourn Hu's passing and to demand democratic reform in China. On April 19, at Peking University (Beida), a meeting was anonymously organized to discuss the ongoing protests in the Square, as well as the prospect of forming an autonomous student organization. The meeting, in essence, was a "democracy salon"—an unofficial student discussion group that students at Beida had founded by the former Beida physics graduate student Liu Gang months before Hu Yaobang's death. The salon decided that an autonomous organization was necessary to coordinate student protesters on multiple Beijing campuses. However, for fear of punishment by the government, few at the meeting were willing to speak out. Those who did, including history student Wang Dan, became the leaders of the newly formed Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.
Another aim of the new Federation was the rejection of the official student organizations. According to one student announcement, "the leadership of the original union is inept, has sold out the students' interests…and is completely unable to represent the students' wishes." In this way, the student protesters saw the Federation as representing the wishes of the entire student body. The Federation planned to seek legitimacy by strict observance of democratic policies such as elections and group decision-making. The students hoped these methods would ensure the organization's unity of leadership, and would effectively contrast with the lack of transparency they perceived in the Communist Party. On May 23, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation established officially at Liu Gang's residence near Yuanmingyuan, during the first meeting, the students had elected Zhou Yongjun as the first chairperson of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.
On April 26, People's Daily published the editorial "It is Necessary to Take a Clear-Cut Stand Against Turmoil", attributing the protests to "a small minority" attempting to "poison people's minds" and "create national turmoil." On the same day, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation was officially established. At their meeting, around 2,000 students elected a seven-person committee to lead the Federation. Concerned by the April 26 editorial, the Federation decided that, as an illegal organization, it needed to reinforce its legitimacy by showing its popular support. To achieve this goal, the Federation organized a demonstration to take place on April 27.
Dialogue and recognition
Between April 16 and 26, the government had dismissed the autonomous students' demands for recognition and dialogue. The government, unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the independent student unions, had attempted instead to arrange talks with individual student leaders. Although the student protesters believed they were acting patriotically and morally, the Communist leadership saw the students' demands as a threat to political and social order. As a result, the students had difficulty obtaining their goal of direct dialogue with the government.
After the April 27 demonstrations, the government held its first dialogue with the Federation leaders on April 29. However, the government avoided direct contact with the Federation, instead inviting student leaders to meet on an individual basis. While some students saw the government's offer as a victory, others felt that they should only attend the dialogue as recognized representatives of the Federation. Wuer Kaixi, a Federation leader, attended the dialogue as a "private individual", but decided to leave midway through to protest the government's lack of recognition of the Federation. Dissatisfied with the dialogue, Wuer Kaixi later described it as a "trick of the government to destroy the student solidarity." During the meeting, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu insisted that the Communist Party and the student protesters shared the same goals.
On May 1, the Federation rejected the legitimacy of the April 29 dialogue in a news conference. The following day, the Federation presented a twelve-point petition, including a demand that future government efforts at dialogue be sincere. Although the government rejected this petition, the petition represented a compromise on the students' part, as Amnesty International researcher Corinna-Barbara Francis suggests. That is, instead of demanding explicit government recognition, the students only asked for dialogue "on the basis of full equality between the two parties." By May 29, the students' demands were reduced to two: denunciation of the April 26 editorial by the government and acknowledgement of the federation's democratic nature.
Division and decline
On May 4, the Federation successfully organized a demonstration of over 100,000 protesters in Tiananmen Square, marking the 70-year anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Also on May 4, the Federation decided to end the boycott on class attendance it had begun on April 24. This sudden and unexpected end to the boycott, and loss of momentum in student-government negotiations, resulted in a loss of student enthusiasm for the protests. As student leader Chai Ling noted "the movement dwindled to a low point as more and more students returned to classes." In an attempt to reinvigorate the movement, Chai Ling and other students started a hunger strike on the Square. Although the Federation initially opposed the hunger strikers during its May 12 meeting, it eventually decided to support individual strikers, but avoided official endorsement of the Hunger Strike Group. As the protests continued throughout May and into June, the Hunger Strike Group would take control of events in the Square, and would largely displace the authority previously held by the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.
Government response
Speaking with CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang on May 4, Premier Li Peng voiced their concern over the ongoing protests in the Square. While Zhao Ziyang contended that the April 26 editorial had encouraged student protesters, Li Peng contended that this was too simple an explanation for the growth of the protest movement, suggesting that the April 26 editorial "did not accuse the vast majority of students of creating turmoil." Li Peng also opposed to the student protester's demands for negotiation. Voicing concern over the rising prominence of the "illegal student organizations," Li objected to the Federation's desire "to negotiate with the Party and government as equals" and saw the students' twelve-point petition as a "threat." In their conversation with Zhao, Li also asserted that the Federation's primary goal was to "negate the leadership of the CCP and negate the entire socialist system."
On May 13, after the hunger strikers announced their plan, Yan Mingfu, Director of the Party's United Front Work Department, met with a number of intellectuals and student protesters, including Wang Dan, Chai Ling, and Wuer Kaixi. At the meeting, Yan Mingfu suggested that if the student protesters stopped their hunger strike and instead submitted their "demands and suggestions through proper channels," they could assure them that "the door to dialogue" would remain open. However, when they later briefed Zhao Ziyang on the meeting, Yan Mingfu shared their unease at the divisions they observed among the student protesters: "the AFS [the Federation], the Dialogue Delegation, and representatives of the hunger strikers…are in disagreement among themselves…I'm not sure any of them truly represents the hunger strikers or can exert any influence on them."

The Cholokashvili (, Russian: Чолокаевы) is a former noble family in Georgia. It claimed an exotic foreign lineage and first appeared in the eastern Georgian province, and later kingdom, of Kakheti in 1320. They were enfeoffed of the office of Prince-Master of the Palace of Kakheti and produced several notable members from the 16th century into the 20th.
History
Traditional genealogical accounts have it that the family's ancestor was a Genoese officer who moved, in the 14th century, from a Crimean colony to Dagestan where they were dubbed by locals as Cholagh "for the multitude of sheep and cattle they possessed". Cholagh is said to have quarreled with the local tribesmen and fled into neighboring Georgia through the Derbend road in 1320. King George V of Georgia welcomed Cholagh and granted them an apanage and the princely title of the extinct family of Irubakidze in Kakheti.
The family played an important role in later-day Georgia and intermarried with the Kakhetian branch of the Bagrationi Dynasty. They were considered one of the 2 "undivided" houses of Kakheti. Their fiefdom — Sacholokao (საჩოლოყაო) — was annexed to Imperial Russia along with east Georgia in 1801, and the family became mediatized as Russian nobility (, Cholokaev; or Челокаевы, Chelokaev). The family briefly held the Duchy of Aragvi from 1747 to c. 1753.

Vela is a constellation in the southern sky, which contains the Vela Supercluster. Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship Argo Navis, which was later divided into three parts, the others being Carina and Puppis. With an apparent magnitude of 1.8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum, one component of which is the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky. Delta and Kappa Velorum, together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form the asterism known as the False Cross. 1.95-magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system.
History
Argo Navis was one of the 48 classical constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and represented the ship Argo, used by Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece in Greek mythology. German cartographer Johann Bayer depicted the constellation on their Uranometria of 1603, and gave the stars Bayer designations from Alpha to Omega. However, their chart was inaccurate as the constellation was not fully visible from the Northern Hemisphere.
Argo was more accurately charted and subdivided in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, forming Carina (the keel), Vela (the sails), and Puppis (the poop deck). Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo's Bayer designations. Therefore, Carina has the Alpha, Beta and Epsilon originally assigned to Argo Navis, while Vela's brightest stars are Gamma and Delta, Puppis has Zeta as its brightest star, and so on.
Characteristics
Vela are bordered by Antlia and Pyxis to the north, Puppis to the northwest, Carina to the south and southwest, and Centaurus to the east. Covering 500 square degrees, it ranks 32nd of the 88 modern constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is "Vel".
The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −37.16° and −57.17°.
Features
Stars
The brightest star in the constellation, Gamma Velorum, is a complex multiple star system. The brighter component, known as Gamma2 Velorum, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.83. It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.6 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 280,000 times as luminous, is around 30 times as massive and is 17 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 35,000 K. The second component is an extremely rare example of hot star known as a Wolf–Rayet star, and is the brightest example in the sky. It has a surface temperature of 57,000 and is around 170,000 times as luminous as our sun, though it radiates most of its energy in the ultraviolet spectrum. Gamma1 is a blue-white star of spectral type B2III and apparent magnitude 4.3. The two pairs are separated by 41 arcseconds, easily separable in binoculars. Parallax measurements give a distance of 1,116 light-years, meaning that they are at least 12,000 AU apart. Further afield are 7.3-magnitude Gamma Velorum C and 9.4-magnitude Gamma Velorum D, lying 62 and 93 arcseconds south-southeast from Gamma2.
The next brightest star is Delta Velorum or Alsephina, also a multiple star system and one of the brightest eclipsing binaries in the sky. Together with Kappa Velorum or Markeb, Iota Carinae or Aspidiske and Epsilon Carinae or Avior, it forms the diamond-shaped asterism known as the False Cross—so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation. Appearing as a white star of magnitude 1.95, Delta is actually a triple or possibly quintuple star system located around 80 light-years from the Solar System. Delta A has a magnitude of 1.99 and is an eclipsing binary composed of two A-type white stars (Delta Aa and Ab) which orbit each other every 45.2 days and lie 0.5 AU from each other, with a resulting drop in magnitude of 0.4 when the dimmer one passes.in front of the brighter. Delta B is a 5.1 magnitude yellow G-class star of similar dimensions to our sun which ranges between 26 and 72 AU away from the brighter pair, taking 142 years to complete a revolution. Further out still, at a distance of 1700 AU, are two red dwarfs of magnitudes 11 and 13. If they are part of the multiple system, they take 28000 years to complete an orbit. Also called Markeb, Kappa appears as a blue-white star of spectral type B2IV-V and magnitude 2.47 but is in fact a spectroscopic binary. The two orbit around each other with a period of 116.65 days, but the size, mass and nature of the companion are as yet unclear.
The orange-hued Lambda Velorum, or Suhail, is the third-brightest star in the constellation. A supergiant of spectral type K4Ib-II, it varies between magnitudes 2.14 and 2.3, and lies 545 light-years distant. It has around 11,000 times the luminosity, 9 to 12 times the mass and 207 times the diameter or our sun.
AH Velorum is a Cepheid variable located less than a degree to the northeast of Gamma. A yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F7Ib-II, it pulsates between magnitudes 5.5 and 5.89 over 4.2 days. Also lying close to Gamma, V Velorum is a Cepheid of spectral type F6-F9II ranging from magnitude 7.2 to 7.9 over 4.4 days. AI Velorum is located 2.8 degrees north-northeast of Gamma, a Delta Scuti variable of spectral type A2p-F2pIV/V that ranges between magnitudes 6.15 and 6.76 in around 2.7 hours.
V390 Velorum is an aged star that has been found to be surrounded by a dusty disk. An RV Tauri variable, it has a spectral type of F3e and ranges between magnitudes 9.01 and 9.27 over nearly 95 days.
Omicron Velorum is a blue-white subgiant of spectral type B3III-IV located around 495 light-years from the Solar System. A slowly pulsating B star, it ranges between magnitudes 3.57 and 3.63 over 2.8 days. It is the brightest star in, and gives its name to, the Omicron Velorum Cluster, also known as IC 2391, an open cluster located around 500 light-years away.
Seven-star systems have been found to have planets. HD 75289 is a Sun-like star of spectral type G0V with a hot Jupiter planetary companion that takes only about 3.51 days to revolve at an orbital distance of 0.0482 AU. WASP-19 is a star of apparent magnitude 12.3 located 815 light-years away, which has a hot Jupiter-like planet that orbits every 0.7 days. HD 73526 is a Sun-like star of spectral type G6V that has two planets around double the mass of Jupiter each with orbits of 187 and 377 days, respectively.
HD 85390 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K1.5V lying around 111 light-years distant with a planet 42 times as massive as earth orbiting every 788 days.
HD 93385 is a Sun-like star of spectral type G2/G3V located around 138 light-years away that is orbited by two super-earths with periods of 13 and 46 days and masses 8.3 and 10.1 times that of Earth, respectively.
Brown dwarfs
The discovery of a binary brown dwarf system named Luhman 16 only 6.6 light-years away, the third-closest system to the Solar System, was announced on 11 March 2013.
Deep-sky objects
Of the deep-sky objects of interest in Vela is a planetary nebula known as NGC 3132, nicknamed the 'Eight-Burst Nebula' or 'Southern Ring Nebula' (see accompanying photo). It lies on the border of the constellation with Antlia. NGC 2899 is an unusual red-hued example. This constellation has 32 more planetary nebulae.
The Gum Nebula is a faint emission nebula, believed to be the remains of a million-year-old supernova. Within it lie the smaller and younger Vela Supernova Remnant. This is the nebula of a supernova explosion that is believed to have been visible from Earth around 10,000 years ago. The remnant contains the Vela Pulsar, the first pulsar to be identified optically. Nearby is NGC 2736, also known as the Pencil Nebula.
HH-47 is a Herbig-Haro Object, a young star around 1,400 light-years from the Sun that is ejecting material at tremendous speed (up to a million kilometres per hour) into its surrounds. This material glows as it hits surrounding gas.
NGC 2670 is an open cluster located in Vela. It has an overall magnitude of 7.8 and is 3,200 light-years from Earth. The stars of NGC 2670, a Trumpler class II 2 p and Shapley class-d cluster, are in a conformation suggesting a bow and arrow. Its class indicates that it is a poor, loose cluster, though detached from the star field. It is somewhat concentrated at its center, and its less than 50 stars range moderately in brightness.
Located 2 degrees south of Gamma Velorum, NGC 2547 is an open cluster containing around 50 stars of magnitudes 7 to 15.
NGC 3201 is a globular cluster discovered by James Dunlop on May 28, 1826. Its stellar population is inhomogeneous, varying with distance from the core. The effective temperature of the stars shows an increase with greater distance, with the redder and cooler stars tending to be located closer to the core. As of 2010, is one of only two clusters (including Messier 4) that shows a definite inhomogeneous population.
RCW 36 is a star-forming region in Vela, and one of the nearest sites of massive star formation. This star-forming region has given rise to a cluster of several hundred young stars that power an HII region. The star-forming region lies in Clump 6 in the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud C.

Thomas Kelly "Tam" McManus (born 28 February 1981) is a Scottish former footballer.
McManus started their career with Hibernian, making over 100 league appearances for the Edinburgh club. During their time there, McManus represented the Scotland national under-21 football team and the Scotland Future team. After leaving Hibs in January 2005, McManus had a nomadic career, including two spells in both the US and the Republic of Ireland.
Career
Early career
McManus grew up in Balornock and Bishopbriggs in the north of Glasgow and started their career with Hibernian, making their debut against Stranraer in 1999. They made their first start in an Edinburgh derby against Heart of Midlothian a year later. They had earlier gained first-team experience with loan spells at East Fife and then Airdrieonians. McManus went on to become a first-team regular for Hibs, enjoying their best season in 2002–03, when they scored 11 goals finishing top goalscorer at the club.
In August 2004, new Hibs manager Tony Mowbray decided McManus would not feature in Hibs' first team plans and they were loaned to Boston United. McManus failed to settle in Lincolnshire, and returned north to sign for Dundee in January 2005. The Dark Blues were struggling in the league, and despite Calum McDonald's goal in a relegation-decider against Livingston, Dundee were demoted to the Scottish First Division. After the game McManus was photographed lying on the pitch in floods of tears. Financial difficulties at Dundee, resultant from relegation and an earlier spell in administration required them to remove the highest-earners from their wage bill and along with Lee Wilkie, McManus negotiated a release settlement in mid-2006.
Falkirk and Dunfermline Athletic
McManus signed for Falkirk in August 2006, but after playing a largely peripheral role in the first half of the 2006–07 season, they were released by the Bairns. Four weeks later, McManus signed a short-term contract with Dunfermline for the remainder of the current season. They scored two goals in six games. In June, they signed a new two-year deal at East End Park despite interest from at least three other SPL clubs. They appeared as a substitute in the UEFA Cup against BK Häcken of Sweden on 30 August 2007 and scored the winning goal on 6 October 2007 against Queen of the South.
Colorado Rapids
In March 2008, McManus was approached by MLS side Colorado Rapids and offered a trial while the club were playing friendlies in England. McManus played 45 minutes against Ipswich Town in a pre-season game for the American side and was widely expected to sign for the side. After over a week of extensive medicals, McManus eventually signed for the MLS outfit on 28 March 2008. McManus made their Colorado Rapids debut on 12 April 2008, coming on as a half-time substitute in the game against New England Revolution. They scored their first Rapids goal in a 2–1 loss to Chicago Fire on 26 April 2008. McManus won the Week 9 Sierra Mist Goal of the Week honour for their 40-yard strike against Chivas USA on 24 May 2008. They were released by the club after refusing to accept a cut in wages.
Derry City
McManus signed for League of Ireland club Derry City on 26 March 2009. McManus was signed for a second time by Stephen Kenny, who was previously their manager at Dunfermline Athletic. McManus scored their first competitive goal for Derry City on 16 July 2009, in their Europa League Second Qualifying Round first leg match away to Latvian side Skonto FC in a 1–1 draw. They left Derry City and returned to Scotland as a free agent due to an illegal contract scandal whereby Derry City were found to be paying salaries more than the 65% of turnover stipulated by the League rules.
Return to Scotland
McManus trained with Ayr United during December 2009. They then went on trial with Grimsby Town for a week, but left after the trial period ended to go back to Scotland. McManus subsequently signed for Ayr United on a deal that tied them to the club until the end of the 2009–10 season. McManus scored on their debut in a 2–1 defeat against Dundee in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup, but left the club at the end of the season.
McManus signed a short-term contract with Falkirk, one of their former clubs, on 2 September 2010. They scored two goals on their second debut for Falkirk, in a 3–1 win against Queen of the South. Despite hitting 7 goals in 11 league starts, McManus was unable to agree to new terms and left the club. McManus signed for Ayr United on a short-term contract in November 2011.
Later career
On 6 February 2012 the Rochester Rhinos of USL Pro announced the signing of McManus. On 20 March 2014 McManus confirmed their signing for League of Ireland Premier Division team Limerick. In June 2015, McManus came out of retirement to sign for newly formed Gartcairn Juniors in the SJFA Central District League Second Division but a hamstring injury ended their playing career for a second time in February 2016.
After playing
Radio
McManus is now a regular live match reporter on BBC Radio Scotland's football coverage of Scottish football on Sportsound: Open All Mics.
Journalism
McManus has also moved into football journalism writing regularly about Scottish football for The Herald newspaper. They speak on the daily Glasgow internet football programme, Peter and Roughie's Football Show.
Hibs TV
As of season 20/21 Tam has been a regular co-commentator for matches broadcast on Hibs TV to season ticket holders/International Hibs TV subscribers.

The Caño Limón oilfield is an oil field crude oil in Arauca Department, Colombia. It is Colombia's second-largest oil field.
History
The Caño Limón oilfield was discovered in July 1983 by Occidental Petroleum. Oil extraction operations began in 1986.
Geology
The Llanos basin is located east of the Eastern Cordillera (Andes) in Colombia. The bulk of the oil is found in deltaic sands of Eocene Mirador and the Upper Cretaceous formation. The average API gravity of oil is 29.5°.
Production
The oil field is jointly owned by the state oil firm Ecopetrol, and Occidental Petroleum. The produced crude oil is transported by the Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline to Colombia's Caribbean coastline.
Environmental issues
The National Institute of Renewable Natural Resources and Environment repeatedly criticized the operation. In 1988, it found that the operators had taken inadequate steps to prevent environmental damage. Later in 1992, it conducted water sampling studies that found high concentrations of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It found that "because of the polluting effluents from Caño Limón, the receiving rivers and lakes are no longer fit for human consumption."

Tribute to Caesar is a 1610-1620 oil on canvas painting by Bartolomeo Manfredi, showing the Render unto Caesar episode from the New Testament.
The artist also produced a pendant to the work entitled Christ with the Doctors in the Temple. Both works were originally in cardinal Carlo de' Medici's collection. On their death it passed to the Casino Mediceo di San Marco, then in 1667 the Palazzo Pitti. It finally reached its present home in the Uffizi in 1753, where it was shown in Zoffany's 1776 Tribuna of the Uffizi.
A 1666 inventory misattributed it to Caravaggio but the art critic Voss restored its correct attribution in 1924, though the 1926 catalogue of paintings in the Uffizi (then under the directorship of Giovanni Poggi) still attributed the work to Caravaggio's school.

Caesium hexafluorocuprate is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a red solid that degrades upon contact with water. It was first prepared be heating and caesium fluoride at 410°C under 350 atmospheres of fluorine:
2 CsCuCl3 + 2 CsF + 5 F2 → 2 Cs2CuF6 + 3 Cl2
The anion [CuF6]2- is a rare example of a copper(IV) complex. In terms of its electronic structure, the anion has a low-spin d7 configuration. It is thus susceptible to Jahn-Teller distortion.

The Shrivatsa (Sanskrit: ; IAST: śrīvatsa) is an ancient symbol considered auspicious in Hinduism and other Indian religious traditions.
Hinduism
Origin
Shrivatsa means "beloved of Sri", an epithet of Vishnu and a reference to their consort, the goddess Lakshmi. It is a mark on the chest of Vishnu, where their consort is described to reside.
The Bhagavata Purana explains the origin of this mark. The story goes that a number of maharishis once gathered on the banks of the river Sarasvati to perform a yajna. A dispute arose among these sages regarding the superiority of the members of the Trimurti: Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiva. The sage Bhrigu was appointed to discover the truth of this matter, and undertook this task by travelling to the abodes of these deities. They felt disrespected by Brahma when the latter was offended by the fact that they had taken their seat on a stool that was not offered to him. They grew anxious when Shiva rose to embrace him, which offered the deity offence as well. Bhrigu then journeyed to the abode of Vishnu:
In the legend of Tirumala, Vishnu's consort, Lakshmi, is offended by the fact that the sage had kicked them beloved, as well as insulted the region of their husband they are associated with the most. They furiously descend upon the earth, where Vishnu finds them as Padmavati, and remarries them in their avatar of Srinivasa.
It is said that the tenth avatar of Vishnu, Kalki, will bear the Shrivatsa mark on their chest.
Shrivatsa is one of the names of Vishnu in the Vishnu Sahasranamam.
The symbol offers the deity another epithet, Śrīvatsalāñcchana, which translates to, "He who has the mark or scar of Śrīvatsa on their chest".
In popular culture
Shrivatsa is a popular name in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
Historical symbolism
In South India, in the bronze sculptures made after circa 10th century, the Shrivatsa symbol is shown as an inverted triangle on the right chest of Vishnu, and their various incarnations.
Buddhism
In Buddhism, the śrīvatsa is said to be a feature of the tutelary deity (Tibetan: yidam) Mañjuśrī the Youth (Skt: Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta).
In Tibetan Buddhism, the śrīvatsa (Tib: དཔལ་བེའུ་, Wyl: dpal be'u) is depicted as a triangular swirl or an endless knot. In the Chinese tradition, Buddhist prayer beads are often tied at the tassels in this shape.
In some lists of the 80 secondary characteristics, it is said that a Buddha's heart is adorned with the śrīvatsa.
Jainism
In Jain iconography, Shrivatsa often marks the chest of the Tirthankara image. It is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious symbols) found in Jainism. The canonical texts such as Hemchandra's Trīṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra and Mahapurana mentions it as one of the Ashtamangalas. Acharya Dinakara explains in their medieval work that the highest knowledge emerged from the heart of Tirthankaras in the form of Shrivatsa so they are marked as such. In North Indian Jain sculptures of the early centuries, it is marked in the centre of the chest.
Other uses
The Shrivatsa is the symbol of Rakhine State and the Rakhine people of Burma.

Wild Arms 2, stylized as Wild ARMs 2 and known in Japan as , is a 1999 role-playing video game for the PlayStation, and the second installment in the Wild Arms series, developed by Media.Vision and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.
When a terrorist organization called Odessa tries to conquer the world, an international anti-terrorist group called ARMS is formed to combat them. They recruit several heroes to help them, including Ashley, a gunfighter; Lilka, a teenage sorceress; and Brad, a former war hero.
Wild Arms 2 was released for the PlayStation Network in Japan on November 28, 2007 and in North America on July 23, 2009.
Gameplay
Wild Arms 2 is a role-playing game that involves the player controlling several characters as they progress through a number of environments, battle enemies, and solve puzzles. The game is presented in an isometric fashion where the player has an overhead view of all the action taking place on a particular screen. While characters are represented as two-dimensional sprites, backgrounds and environments are instead rendered in 3D. The game's camera is centered on the currently controlled character, which can be rotated by the player through 360 degrees.
In order to advance, the player must overcome a number of story-based scenarios and sequences that involving navigating through dungeons while fighting monsters and other enemies that appear randomly every few steps. Oncoming battles are indicated by a speech balloon with an exclamation mark appearing over the character's head, and can in some instances be avoided. Characters progress and grow by gaining experience points after a battle and thereby gain levels, giving them better statistics and making them able to battle increasingly difficult enemies. Progressively more powerful armor and weapons can be purchased for each character from specialized shops in towns throughout the world, and new skills can be learned to help the player complete tougher challenges.
Special devices called "Tools" unique to each character allow the player to traverse otherwise impassable situations while not in battle. These items are obtained at certain points in the game, and allow hidden areas or pathways to be discovered, as well as destroy objects and solve puzzles. Tools such as Brad's "kick boots" allow them to move large objects by hitting them, and Lilka's fire wand allows the player to light torches and activate switches from afar.
Tools
Throughout the game, one acquires many tools. Each character can unlock three tools. Ashley's tools are the Hurl Knife, Booty Call (secret - telepath tower), and Flare Gun. Brad's tools are the Kick Boots, Bombs, and Earthquake. Lilka utilizes three rods: Fire, Freeze, and Change, which turns large gems into traversable blocks. Tim uses "Pooka", a guide which can unlock secret "medium" powers, as well as Air Ballet and Mist Cloak. Kanon uses the Wire Hook, Rad Blades, and Jump Shoes. Marivel, the secret character, comes with the Electel, and can unlock the Windup Key and My Mike, which summons secret enemies.
Battle system
While normal gameplay is exhibited using both two and three-dimensional graphics, battle sequences are rendered entirely in 3D. Wild Arms 2 utilizes a turn-based approach to combat, with playable characters and enemies acting according to their "response" or RES statistic, a numerical designation that shows how fast a character is and how soon they can act. A character or enemy with the highest response rate will act first, followed by the next highest in sequence every combat round until the battle is over. Each round, the player has the option of performing a number of actions with each character, including attacking enemies, defending, running from battle, or using curative items to restore hit points, a representation of a particular character's remaining vitality.
In all, six characters are available for use in and out of combat, though only three may be used in a particular battle. In addition to having different statistics such as strength and magic power, each character has a unique set of abilities at their disposal. Ashley and Brad, each firearm users, can use powerful attacks based on whatever weaponry the player has collected throughout the course of the game, while Lilka, a magician, can conjure a variety of spells to either aid party members by curing wounds or damage enemies with harmful magic. Additional members Tim, Kanon, and Marivel have their own respective techniques as well. Each character can be actively switched in or out of a battle at any time, provided enough characters are in the player's party at the time.
Plot
Setting
Wild Arms 2 is set in the world of Filgaia, a planet made to resemble the American Old West with additional science fiction, steampunk, and traditional fantasy elements. An example of "Weird West", the game contains several stock elements from American Western films, literature, and folklore, including expansive deserts, dry plains, red rock canyons, saloons, and gunfights melded with traditional role-playing game story elements such as magic and demons.
Firearms factor heavily in Filgaia's mythology. Called "ARMs", these weapons represent the world's ever-growing warfare technology, and, unlike the first Wild Arms, are not considered inherently dangerous. Similar technology is used to create other mechanical weaponry not common in normal Western fiction, including cybernetic limbs and miniature robots. Other forms of high technology such as aircraft, motorized vehicles, and radio devices also make an appearance, though some of their usage is attributed to magic rather than science.
Characters
The cast of Wild Arms 2 is made up of a number of playable and non-playable characters who each contribute to the advancement of the story. The main characters are those controlled by the player, consisting of six heroes who are called upon by a wealthy benefactor to put an end to the terrorist organization Odessa, who act as the game's principal adversaries. "Operation ARMS" serves as the moniker of the player's team, with each member contributing something unique to both gameplay and the story, led by the reluctant young gunman Ashley Winchester. ARMS is aided by a number of other supporting characters, including Ashley's girlfriend Marina. The game's primary conflict stems from the two group's conflicting ideologies on the safety of the world. While Odessa seeks to bring about order through oppression and conformity, ARMs instead sees Odessa's methods as a sacrifice of freedom and the largest threat to global security.
The main characters include Ashley Winchester, Lilka Eleniak, Brad Evans, Tim Rhymeless, Kanon, and Marivel Armitage, a secret character that can be unlocked at "Crimson Castle". Irving Vold Valeria, the leader of ARMS, introduces Marivel in the beginning of the game, and their true form is shown at the "Memory Maze", where the Sword Magess Anastasia reveals themselves to Ashley. Marivel then joins ARMS at Crimson Castle, and several different events can be unlocked.
Story
One thousand years earlier, a great Blaze of Disaster swept the land of Filgaia. The cause was a demon known as Lord Blazer. Many heroes tried to defeat them and failed, until a girl holding the magic sword Argetlahm stepped forth and did battle with him, ultimately managing to defeat him. However, they could not kill him; rather, they exchanged their life in order to seal Lord Blazer away forever. The girl's name was forgotten by time, and they became known as simply the Sword Magess.
In the present day, Filgaia is a desolate land, dying steadily. Much of the world has already become desert, and the few areas of greenery left are steadily declining. Ashley Winchester, a member of a military unit near Meria Boule, becomes involved in the fate of the world when their group is involved in a demon summoning experiment. This experiment is conducted by the sinister organization of Odessa in order to resurrect Lord Blazer - or so it seems. After all of their friends and comrades have been possessed by demons, Ashley is finally taken over as well. After killing all of their former comrades, they claim the legendary Argetlahm, which had been brought to the summoning ceremony as a relic. After coming into contact with it, they confront both the demon inside him, Lord Blazer himself, and the wielder of the sword, the Sword Magess. Managing to repress Lord Blazer for the time being, Ashley escapes back to their home town of Meria.
However, this is not the end of it for Ashley. They soon receives an offer from a mysterious man named Irving to join an elite team of fighters named "ARMS" (Agile Remote Missions Squad)/(Awkward Rush and Mission Savers). After accepting, Ashley meets the other two people selected for ARMS - Lilka Eleniak and Brad Evans; one an ex-war hero turned criminal, one a girl in training to be a Crest Sorceress. Irving reveals their plans to them: they wish to combat Odessa, which they claim will make its presence known to the world soon. The three protagonists engage in a series of events that eventually come to involve the fate of the world of Filgaia itself.
Reception
The game received average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Eric Bracher of NextGen called it "An adequate title, but one that doesn't have as much to offer as competitors such as Vagrant Story or Alundra 2." In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

Solitomab (INN; development code MT110) is an artificial bispecific monoclonal antibody that is being investigated as an anti-cancer drug. It is a fusion protein consisting of two single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of different antibodies on a single peptide chain of about 55 kilodaltons. One of the scFvs binds to T cells via the CD3 receptor, and the other to EpCAM as a tumor antigen against gastrointestinal, lung, and other cancers.
Mechanism of action
Like other bispecific antibodies, and unlike ordinary monoclonal antibodies, solitumab forms a link between T cells and its target tumor cell antigen. This causes T cells to exert cytotoxic activity on tumor cells by producing proteins like perforin and granzymes, independently of the presence of MHC I or co-stimulatory molecules. These proteins enter tumor cells and initiate the cell's apoptosis. This action mimics physiological processes observed during T cell attacks against tumor cells.

Luheria constricta is a species of leafhopper in the subfamily Deltocephalinae. It has a large range from northern Argentina north through Bolivia and northeastern Brazil. It is the only member of the genus Luheria and the tribe Luheriini making them both monotypic taxa.
L. constricta is a medium to large leafhopper. Its color can range from yellow to orange to brown.
The species has an unusual 28S rDNA sequence which makes it difficult to perform phylogenetic analysis on the species, thus its position within Deltocephalinae is uncertain.

Wharfedale ( ) is the valley of the upper parts of the River Wharfe and one of the Yorkshire Dales. It is situated within the districts of Craven and Harrogate in North Yorkshire, and the cities of Leeds and Bradford in West Yorkshire. It is the upper valley of the River Wharfe. Towns and villages in Wharfedale (downstream, from west to east) include Buckden, Kettlewell, Conistone, Grassington, Hebden, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, Arthington, Collingham and Wetherby. Beyond Wetherby, the valley opens out and becomes part of the Vale of York.
The section from the river's source to around Addingham is known as Upper Wharfedale and lies in North Yorkshire and in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The first or so is known as Langstrothdale, including the settlements of Beckermonds, Yockenthwaite and Hubberholme, famous for its church, the resting place of the writer J. B. Priestley. As it turns southwards, the Wharfe then runs through a green and lush valley, with limestone outcrops, such as Kilnsey Crag, and woodland, generally quite unusual in the Dales.
Below Addingham, the dale broadens and turns to the east. This section is shared between North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire and includes the towns of Ilkley, Otley and Wetherby. The northern side of Lower Wharfedale, opposite Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale and Otley, is in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
The Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust has a remit to conserve the ecological condition of Wharfedale, Wensleydale, Swaledale and Nidderdale catchments from their headwaters to the Humber Estuary.
History
The Wharfedale valley was cut into the shape we know today during the last ice age (the Devensian Glaciation). The valley was transformed into its classic U-shaped state between 18,000 and 12,000 years ago by the Wharfedale Glacier, though this was cutting through a channel that had already had a river draining water away to the east through what is now Wharfedale, and also to the north through what is now Bishopdale and then Wensleydale.
Evidence of human settlement has been found dating back to Neolithic times and the valley has plenty of artefacts relating to the Celtic, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The Romans built a road over Stake Moss into what is now the village of Bainbridge in Wensleydale.
The Anglo-Saxon influence remains in modern times, with most settlements in Upper Wharfedale having Anglo-Saxon derived names.
The name of the valley is derived from the principal river that flows through it: the Wharfe, which comes from the Old English Weorf or Old Norse Hverfr, with both taken as meaning winding river. The River Wharfe starts at the confluence (at the hamlet of Beckermonds) of the Oughtershaw Beck and the Green Field Beck, each of which originates at the Pennine watershed, some north-east of Ribblehead. The valley roughly follows a south-easterly direction, providing a border between West Yorkshire (on the south side) and North Yorkshire. Between Oughtershaw Moss and Wetherby, the valley runs for . The uppermost part of the valley is known as Langstrothdale. Below Beckermonds the river is known as the River Wharfe. Wetherby is traditionally seen as the foot of Wharfedale, even though the river continues on through the Vale of York.
The valley has been used largely for agriculture, and is now criss-crossed with stone walls and stone barns that evidence its use down the centuries.
Geology
The geology of the valley is split, with Upper Wharfedale consisting of carboniferous limestone of the Yoredale series. In the lower part of Wharfedale, around Ilkley and Otley, the underlying stone is mostly millstone grit, which can be seen best at the Cow and Calf rocks on the south side of the valley on Ilkley Moor.
Wharfedale Ward
As an electoral subdivision Wharfedale is a ward in the north east of the City of Bradford metropolitan borough. It consists of the settlements of Burley-in-Wharfedale, Burley Woodhead and Menston along with surrounding moorland. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 Census was 11,836.
Deanery of South Craven and Wharfedale
In 2017, in consideration of regional geography, the Church of England changed its subdivisions and re-grouped the Deanery of Wharfedale with that of South Craven, in order that the similar regions can work together more effectively.
Wharfedale in culture
One of the most renowned painters of the Victorian era, John Atkinson Grimshaw, portrayed the area in their piece, "Moonlight, Wharfedale" (1871 – oil on card ).  They are known as one of the best and most accomplished nightscape and townscape artists of all time, and this painting is a prime example of their mastery. J. M. W. Turner also visited and painted scenes around Otley and Ilkley. Turner was commissioned to paint Kilnsey Crag, which they created as an oil painting in 1816.
The valley was featured in episode three of the BBC Two series, The Yorkshire Dales.

Gerry Gallagher (born December 15, 1951) is an American football coach and former player.  They are currently the offensive coordinator at Parsippany High School in Parsippany, New Jersey, a position they have held since 2013. Gallagher served as the head coach at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania from 1986 to 1988 and at William Paterson University from 1989 to 1996, compiling a career college football record of 44–64–1.
A native of Morris County, New Jersey, Gallagher attended Morris Catholic High School, where they graduated in 1969. They then attended William Paterson University to play football for the school's first ever team. Gallagher would score the first two touchdowns in the program's history.
Gallagher began their coaching career at Morris Catholic High School, where they served as an assistant coach from 1973 to 1976. In 1977, they became the new head coach and held that position until 1983. Gallagher's first college football coaching job was spent at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania for the 1984 and 1985 seasons as an offensive coordinator, followed by three years at Saint Francis and eight at William Paterson. Since 1997 they have coached at Montville High School in New Jersey and in 2006 guided the Montville Mustangs to the State Championship Game at Giants Stadium.
Through the 2009 college football season, Gallagher is the only William Paterson coach to guide their team to any playoff appearances. In 1991, William Paterson made it to the first round of the ECAC playoffs, and in 1993 they made it to the second round of the NCAA Division III playoffs.
In 2015, Coach Gallagher began coaching the defensive backs at the Delbarton School, in Morristown, New Jersey. They were named Special Teams Coordinator at Delbarton in 2016.
In addition, Gallagher was inducted into the New Jersey Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2011 following them being Coach Of The Year in 2006.
Offensive philosophy
Gallagher has, throughout their coaching career, been a strong adherent to the Delaware Wing-T system. It relies heavily on misdirection and motion to confuse the opposing defense while their linebackers are trying to make reads. Gallagher has experienced varying levels of success with this system throughout their career as the system demands a lot from the offensive linemen. Their abilities to hold block, pull with speed and to remember their assignments which are often given in pairs or threes for each play. Gallagher saw the most success with this system most recently in the 2006 football system, where their Montville team matched up against West Essex High School in then-Giants Stadium for the Group 3 State Championship, where they do coached athletes such as John Gauweiler, Mike Todisco, and Chris Collins.

The combat box was a tactical formation used by heavy (strategic) bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. The combat box was also referred to as a "staggered formation". Its defensive purpose was in massing the firepower of the bombers' guns, while offensively it concentrated the release of bombs on a target.
Initially formations were created in keeping with the pre-war Air Corps doctrine that massed bombers could attack and destroy targets in daylight without fighter escort, relying on interlocking fire from their defensive machine guns, almost exclusively the "light barrel" Browning AN/M2 .50-calibre (12.7 mm) gun. However the use of high altitudes by USAAF bombers resulted in factors that demanded a tighter bomb pattern and the combat box continued in use even after the advent of fighter escort – and especially starting in the spring of 1944 over Europe, with USAAF fighters flying far ahead of the combat boxes in air supremacy mode instead against the Luftwaffe's fighters – largely mitigated the threat of fighter interception.
Creation of the concept is credited to Colonel Curtis E. LeMay, commander of the 305th Bombardment Group in England. However the Eighth Air Force had been experimenting with different tactical formations since its first bombing mission on 17 August 1942, several of which were also known as "boxes." LeMay's group did create the "Javelin Down" combat box in December 1942, and that formation became the basis for the numerous variations of combat boxes that followed.
The practice of referring to a concentrated formation as a "box" was the result of diagramming formations in plan, profile and front elevation views, positioning each individual bomber in an invisible boxlike area.
The evolution of Eighth Air Force formations
1942 experiments
The first ten missions of the Eighth Air Force from England in August 1942 were shallow penetrations of France strongly supported by Royal Air Force Spitfire fighter escorts. B-17 Flying Fortresses flew in six-plane squadrons with two to four miles between squadrons, to avoid mid-air collisions between the inexperienced crews. Although unable to support each other, the six-plane squadrons had the virtues of simplicity and ease of control. The bombers within a squadron were stacked at three altitudes with approximately between the highest and lowest, and except for the lead pair, were not in mutually supporting elements. As missions grew larger in size, deeper in penetration, and faced increasingly effective defenders, the AAF recognized that more compact formations were needed and returned to the three-aircraft vee formation that had been standard before the war. Squadrons consisted of three such vees, all flying at the same altitude, with two such squadrons in a group formation, the second higher, trailing, and staggered to the right. The entire formation was high, deep, and nearly across. It proved cumbersome to maneuver, as did a 36-plane alternative, and left many bomber gunners with restricted fields of fire.
The original two heavy bomb groups of the Eighth Air Force transferred to North Africa and were replaced in October and November by four new groups of B-17s (the 306th, 91st, 303rd, and 305th groups), and two of B-24 Liberators (44th and 93rd BGs), each of which experimented with its own formations. Their early missions included numerous mechanical turnbacks ("aborts") which hampered development of effective schemes.
Between November 1942 and the end of the war various configurations of the combat box were adopted to meet changing conditions, particularly changed German tactics that stressed head-on attacks against the weak forward firepower of the bombers. The 305th BG innovated the 18-aircraft "Javelin Down" formation, which stacked planes within an element and squadrons within a group downwards in the direction of the sun. This aided gunners on the higher aircraft in seeing lower aircraft without being blinded by glare. In the front elevation the formation resembled a set of stairs, but in profile and plan resembled a spear point. Unlike earlier group formations in which the lead bomber had flown in the lowest position, it now was placed in the center of the formation vertically. The 305th successfully tested the formation on a December 6, 1942, mission to Lille, and it was immediately adopted by the other three B-17 groups.
The 305th soon developed a more compact staggered formation that stacked elements downward in one direction, but stacked squadrons upward in the opposite direction. A third element of three bombers was added to the 18-plane box, placed in the most exposed squadron for additional support. This resulted in a 21-plane wedge-shaped configuration that was adopted by all groups on January 13, 1943, and remained standard through September 1943.
In 1943, the use of assembly ships, modified older bombers with unique paint schemes, to organize combat boxes was devised. These planes continued to be used throughout the war, even with the invention of other technological advances.
Wing boxes
Although the combat box was initially designed around a group of airplanes, it was expanded to include a formation of three groups flying together as a "combat wing", all of which were based on the same triangular design of a leading bomber (or grouping of bombers) in the center, and two bombers (or groupings) immediately behind in a vee shape, with one at an altitude above and one below the center in close proximity for mutual defense. The new combat boxes continued to be used, but groups were placed in a horizontal column and stacked at increasing altitude to decrease their vulnerability to attack. This resulted in the rear formations lagging behind which impacted both defensive tactics and bombing performance.
The wing box, a 54-plane formation (basically three 18-plane boxes stacked in a similar fashion to the group box), evolved from a need to provide defensive fire against head-on attacks. The formations were stacked so that while squadrons were stacked away from the sun on missions, groups were stacked in the opposite direction, making for a more compact wing box. Because the Eighth AF had only four B-17 units until May 1943, composite groups were formed by combining squadrons from different groups, or a fourth group was added to the wing box to form a diamond-shaped box. The latter was flown in a trailing position behind the wing and proved susceptible to Luftwaffe tactics of attacking the extremities of formations. The wing box was often spread vertically, deep, and across and was difficult to maintain.
The most serious disadvantage of the wing box was that the lowermost and uppermost elements, trailing at the end of the formation, had the least mutual protection. An additional risk was that of an aircraft being struck by falling bombs if it strayed in the box (see image):
<blockquote>"Directly below us (on 19 May 1944 to Berlin in B-17G 42-102411<ref>Miss Lace</ref>) in the path of our falling bombs was a B-17 out of position. Later pictures show a B-17 having their left stablizer shorn off by a five hundred-pound bomb dropped from above. That plane went into a steep dive, out of control, and was lost. As mentioned before, the bombs had to fall about five hundred feet or more before the protective vane spun off to leave the bomb armed." —303rd BG pilot Richard Riley Johnson</blockquote>
In the summer of 1943 the Eighth expanded in size to 16 groups of B-17s and 4 of B-24s, and by the following June would grow to 39 groups. The table of organization and equipment for heavy bombardment groups was increased from 35 to 62 planes with a huge influx of new bombers beginning in the autumn of 1943, and the use of composite groups was discontinued as many groups flew two group boxes on a single mission.
The 54-plane wing combat box used by the Eighth's B-17s required both practice and discipline to maintain formation. Turbulence from leading bombers added to the difficulty of maintaining formation. The 54-plane box is capable of fielding upwards of 700 heavy calibre defensive machine guns in total to serve as a formidable defense against fighters, however. As flak became the greater threat in May 1944, the 36-plane box was resurrected in a much looser formation and became the standard through the remainder of the war except on days when significant fighter opposition was anticipated.
Group combat box revisions
In October 1943 the first radar-guided Pathfinder group began operations, bringing about a need for a compact 36-plane group formation to optimize bombing performance in adverse weather conditions. This was done initially by doubling the number of three-plane elements in a squadron formation from two to four, and placing all three planes within an element at the same altitude to avoid collisions. LeMay, who had been promoted to command of the 3rd Bomb Division, devised this diamond-shaped 12-plane combat box and preferred it over others, so that in August 1944 when they took command of Operation Matterhorn in India they adopted it as the basic formation for B-29 Superfortresses. A variation of the formation using four 9-plane squadrons in a diamond formation was developed to compress the bombing pattern further.
Wing boxes followed each other in trail, and the formation was easier for escorts to protect. However, the close stagger of the four-squadron 36-plane was difficult to maintain, and increased the likelihood of a bomber flying at the bottom of the box being struck by bombs dropped from a higher plane. In visual bombing situations the revised 36-plane box eliminated the lowest squadron to lessen the possibility. Although the 36- and 27-bomber group combat box became standard for most of 1944, a diamond-shaped formation of four 10-plane squadrons was developed for B-24s of both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force.
During the winter of 1944–45, minimizing losses to flak became a priority. The 27-plane box became standard for B-17s for all of 1945, spread more laterally to avoid catastrophic damage to the formation from a single shell burst. At the same time wingmen flew more forward on element leaders, creating a box that was stacked vertically, from front to back, and laterally. This final variation presented flak gunners with a small target, produced excellent bomb patterns, and was both easy to fly and control.
B-24 combat boxes
B-24s of the 2nd Air Division, more difficult than B-17s to fly in formation at high altitudes and with more restricted cockpit visibility, used a variation of the 27-plane group box. One element of each squadron (normally the uppermost in the middle/lead and high/right squadrons, and lowermost in the low/left squadron) was moved to the outside of the formation so that it was abreast of the trailing element. This produced a line formation that was wide and vertically, but only deep, reducing the time over target significantly. The 96th Combat Bomb Wing further refined the formation during its bomb runs by shifting the lead squadron into the highest position, the second squadron overlapping it in trail and lower, and the third squadron in file behind the second and another 150 feet lower. This produced devastatingly accurate bombing results in the last months of the war.
Fifteenth Air Force formations
The Fifteenth Air Force, consisting of a preponderance of B-24 groups flying at altitudes or lower than those flown by the B-17 groups in the Eighth Air Force, employed a larger group box during the period of December 1943 to July 1944. Called the "six-box formation", it consisted of forty aircraft, with the group divided into two units of twenty B-24s, one behind the other, and each unit consisted of three squadron boxes.
The center squadron (known as Able Box) of the first unit was a composite formation of six aircraft containing the group leader, with the deputy leader flying on its wing. The other four aircraft of Able Box were from the two squadrons assigned to the unit for that mission, with the six bombers formed in two vee formations in trail and stepped lower in altitude. On each side of the lead squadron were seven-bomber boxes called Baker Box (to the right) and Charlie Box (to the left), each box made up of bombers of one squadron, also in vees of three, with one additional bomber flying in the slot of the center rear (sixth position) of each squadron box, and known as "Tail-end Charlie". This seventh position was usually flown by the least experienced crew in the squadron and was vulnerable to fighter attack, so perilous that it was commonly called the "coffin corner" or "Purple Heart corner". The second unit of the group formation was configured identically, except that its boxes were named Dog, Easy, and Fox. Each position within a box was numbered, so that the group leader flew the Able One position while the Tail-end Charlie of the leftmost rear squadron flew Fox Seven. The second unit flew at an altitude approximately lower than the first unit.
Because it was laterally wide, the six-box formation was not a compact formation, was cumbersome to fly, and thus was less efficient in bombing accuracy. The Fifteenth Air Force adopted the diamond formation during the summer of 1944 to increase its bombing accuracy, but this also had the negative consequences of increasing losses to flak. This formation reduced the number of boxes from six to four, each flying three elements of three planes each with a Tail-end Charlie. As with the six-box formation, the trailing elements were stacked downward from the high leader, and the Tail-end Charlie of the fourth box (Dog Ten) was still often referred to as "the Purple Heart position". The four-box formation proved easier to assemble and organize, provided a tight bomb pattern, and concentrated defensive firepower against fighter attacks.

Pierre-Gustave-Gaspard Joly de Lotbinière (February 5, 1798 - June 8, 1865) was a French business person and amateur daguerreotypist, born citizen of the Republic of Geneva, and married to a Canadian seigneuress. Famous for being the first to photograph the Acropolis of Athens and some ancient Egyptian monuments, they are also the father of Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, premier of Quebec from 1878 to 1879.
Biography
Early life
Pierre-Gustave Joly was the son of Antoine Joly de Marval, merchant, and of Ursula Fehr de Brunner. Early in the 1800s, their family settled in Épernay in Champagne, where they specialized in wine trading. While the father and the eldest son, Moïse-Salomon, remained in Épernay, Pierre-Gustave travelled far and wide to find new buyers, first concentrating on Europe, including Germany, Poland, Russia and Sweden, eventually even crossing the Atlantic Ocean to visit the United States and Canada.
While there, they met and on December 17, 1828, married in Montreal Julie-Christine Chartier de Lotbinière, daughter of Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière 2nd Marquis de Lotbinière. The seigneury of Lotbinière near Quebec City was their dowry. After their wedding, they unofficially added "de Lotbinière" to their name. The couple spent the first two years of their marriage in Épernay, where in 1829 their first son, Henri-Gustave, was born, then lived from 1830 in Lotbinière. There, Joly managed their wife's possessions as well as their own investments in French Guiana and the Canadian railroad. They also sometimes travelled to France.
Traveller in Greece, Egypt and the Holy Land
In 1839, Joly was in Paris at the time when Louis Daguerre unveiled their early photographic process to the scientific world. Embarking on a trip to the Middle East, Pierre-Gustave acquired one of the first daguerreotype cameras from Noël Paymal Lerebours in order to make photographic records of the ancient monuments they were about to see on their journey. They travelled via Malta to Greece, where they visited Athens and other places, and then carried on to Alexandria. There, they met the painter Horace Vernet and their nephew, Frédéric Goupil-Fesquet, who were also carrying daguerreotype equipment. The three men undertook some excursions in Egypt together before parting company. Joli then travelled to the Holy Land, Syria and Turkey. Back in Paris, five of their 92 plates were published by Lerebours in their book Excursions daguerriennes (1840–41), others by architect Hector Horeau for their book Panorama from Egypt and Nubia (1841). Due to technological restrictions, the daguerreotypes themselves could not be reproduced and, instead, were copied as engravings which could then be printed. None of Joly's original plates has been identified, and they may well be lost. What they contained is known through their diary which has been published in 2011.
Later life
They returned to their family in Quebec and is not known to ever taking any further photographs after this trip. Instead, Joly built a summer estate at Pointe-Platon near Sainte-Croix. Known today as Domaine Joly-De Lotbinière, the estate has been entered in the register of Canada's Historic Places.
In 1861, after 33 years of marriage, Joly separated from their wife who, in the previous year, had signed over the seigneury of Lotbinière to their eldest son Henri-Gustave. Joly went back to Paris where they died in 1865 and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery. Their wife died in Quebec, October 24, 1887, having survived their husband for many years, aged 77 and their remains was buried at Vaudreuil.
Children
The couple had three children, one daughter and two sons.
Their eldest son, Sir Henri-Gustave Joly served as Premier of Quebec and Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. Joly inherited the seigneury of Lotbinière from their mother in 1960, and later the family estate of Pointe Platon. They assumed their mother's maiden name "de Lotbinière" to their name, by Act of Parliament, in 1888. They were created a K.C.M.G. by Queen Victoria, 1895.
Their daughter Amelie-Ursule Joly married Captain Henry George (H.G.) Savage, R.E., and their daughter, Alice, became the Vicomtesse de Coux after marrying Alfred Aimé Etienne Michel de Coux.
Their son Edmond Joly, entered the army, being gazetted to the 32nd Regiment. While
on sick leave, they volunteered for service in the Crimea, and was present with the Connaught
Rangers at the taking of Sebastopol. In 1857 they left for India, to rejoin their old
regiment. Edmond Joly was with the Connaught Rangers at the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855), but was killed at the Siege of Lucknow September 25, 1857.

The Repnin Sejm () was a Sejm (session of the parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that took place between 1767 and 1768 in Warsaw. This session followed the Sejms of 1764 to 1766, where the newly elected King of Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski, attempted with some successes to push through reforms to strengthen the government of the Commonwealth. These reforms were viewed as dangerous by Poland's neighbors, who preferred a weak Commonwealth and did not want to see it threaten their own political and military aspirations. The Russian Empire sent ambassador Nikolai Repnin, who became the driving force behind the Sejm proceedings. The Repnin Sejm marked one of the important milestones in increasing Polish dependence on the Russian Empire, and turning it into a Russian protectorate. This dependent position was bluntly spelled out in Nikita Ivanovich Panin's letter to King Poniatowski, in which they made it clear that Poland was now in the Russian sphere of influence.
History
The Ambassador of the Russian Empire to Warsaw Prince Nikolai Repnin received orders from Russian Empress Catherine the Great to bribe and coerce the Sejm deputies in order to push legislation favourable to Russia, in effect "a carefully drafted plan for destroying the republic". At that time Poland had a population of about 11.5 million, out of which about 1 million were non-Catholics. In their preparations Repnin fostered unrest among the religious minorities – Protestants (mostly in Royal Prussia and Greater Poland) and Eastern Orthodox (mostly in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), who wanted to have equal rights with the Roman Catholics. Repnin was well aware that a Catholic-dominated Sejm would be strongly opposed to such demands. They also calculated that such a demand itself would make the szlachta suspicious of all reform, including the recent reforms of King Stanisław August Poniatowski and their supporters from the magnate Czartoryski family. Repnin's calculations were proven correct at the Sejm of 1766, which not only rejected the dissident bill, but repealed all of Poniatowski's reforms. This weakened the position of King Poniatowski. Supporters of the previous King Augustus III of Poland from the Electorate of Saxony, led by Gabriel Podoski, started a campaign to dethrone the king.
In order to further Russian goals, Repnin encouraged the formation of two Protestant konfederacjas of Słuck and Toruń and later, Catholic (Radom Confederation, led by Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł). The first act of the Radom Confederation was to send a delegation to Saint Petersburg, petitioning Catherine to guarantee the liberties of the Republic, and allow the proper legislation to be settled by the Russian ambassador at Warsaw. With Russian troops sent to "protect" the various pro-Russian factions and this carte blanche in their pocket, Repnin proceeded to treat the deputies of the Sejm as if they were already servants of the Russian empress.
The opposition was headed by four bishops: Bishop of Lwów Wacław Hieronim Sierakowski (1699–1784), Bishop of Chełm Feliks Turski (1729–1800), Bishop of Cracow Kajetan Sołtyk (1715–1788), and Bishop of Kiev Józef Andrzej Załuski (1702–1774). To break the opposition, Repnin ordered the arrest of four vocal opponents of their policies in the Polish capital, namely bishops Józef Andrzej Załuski and Kajetan Sołtyk and hetman Wacław Rzewuski with their son Seweryn. All of them members of the Senate of Poland, they were arrested by Russian troops on October 13, 1767 and imprisoned in Kaluga for 5 years.
Through the Polish nobles that they bribed (like Gabriel Podoski, Primate of Poland) or threatened by the presence of over 10,000 Russian soldiers in Warsaw and even in the very chambers of the parliament, Repnin, despite some misgivings about the methods they were ordered to employ, de facto dictated the terms of that Sejm. The intimidated Sejm, which met in October 1767 and adjourned till February 1768, appointed a commission (the so-called Delegated Sejm) which drafted a Polish–Russian treaty, approved in a "silent session" (without debate) on February 27, 1768. The legislation undid some of the reforms of 1764 under King Poniatowski and pushed through legislation which ensured that the political system of the Commonwealth would be ineffective and easily controlled by its foreign neighbours. The liberum veto, wolna elekcja (free election), neminem captivabimus, rights to form the confederation and rokosz — in other words, all the important privileges of the Golden Liberty, which made the Commonwealth so ungovernable — were guaranteed as unalterable parts in the Cardinal Laws.
The Sejm, however, also passed some more beneficial reforms. Russia, which had used the pretext of increased religious freedoms for the Protestant and Orthodox Christians to destabilize the Commonwealth in the first place, now had to push those reforms through the Sejm to save face. Thus, the legislation of the Sejm granted those religious minorities the same status as that of the previously dominant Roman Catholics, and some privileges of the Catholic clergy were limited. In addition, the penalty for killing a peasant was increased from a fine to the death, liberum veto was abolished on sejmiks (local parliaments), and a mint was created. All those reforms were guaranteed by the Russian Empress, Catherine II. The resulting reaction among Poland's Roman Catholic leadership to the laws granting privileges to the Protestants, as well as the deep resentment of Russia's meddling in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), directed against Poniatowski and Russia, which ended with Russian victory and the First Partition of Poland.

Prakāśa is a concept of Kashmir Shaivism translated by various authors as "light", "splendour", "light of consciousness" (identified with Śiva) (Swami Lakshman Joo), "luminous and undifferentiated consciousness" (Paul E. Murphy) or "primordial light beyond all manifestations" (Paul Muller-Ortega). Fellow Tantric practitioners Tibetan Buddhists practice Clear Light yoga based on a similar concept.
Prakāśa is considered supreme, ultimate, unsurpassable, but as such it cannot be described as pure transcendence, because even though it is above all, it is still present in the manifestation, in every aspect of it. Thus prakāśa is said to be both transcendent and immanent.
The prakāśa-vimarśa couple
Uncreated light (prakāśa) is the essence of Śiva. Its function is to illuminate, to make manifest. However, Kashmir Shaivism declares that the nature of prakāśa is "self apprehension", or, to reflect upon itself. "If the supreme light were devoid of this free and spontaneous self-referential capacity, it would be powerless and inert".Prakāśa and vimarśa form a couple at the supreme level, identified respectively with Śiva and Śakti.
Related terms and synonyms
Kashmir Shaivism accords a very important role to the concept of consciousness as light, so, repeatedly trying to describe this essentially undescribable experience, has given it a plurality of names:
sphurattā - twinkling, spark
ābhāsa - splendour, light, appearance, shining forth
pratibhā - to shine upon, become clear or manifest, intuition
- glittering, sparkling
ullāsa - light, splendour, bright
Subjective experiences of prakāśa
There is no way a personal experience of prakāśa could be fully conveyed into words, but mystics, both ancient and modern, have tried to do so, because such words carry a powerful spiritual charge. Some of the subjective attributes of the light of consciousness, in synthesis, are: "liquid", "blissful", "immaculate", "blinding", "enveloping" and "weightless". Here are but a few of the many accounts:
Gopi Krishna
Gopi Krishna, in their first experience of the awakening of kundalini has experienced luminous manifestations they described as:
"a halo of light",
"a stream of liquid light",
"waves of light" and
"a sea of light"
Jaideva Singh
In their translation of Pratyabhijnahridayam uses such formulations :
about consciousness : "the perfect I-consciousness is full of light and bliss"
about the spiritual heart : " is not the physical heart. It had been called because it is the center of reality. It is the light of consciousness."
the world as seen from the perspective of the liberated being - "the world no longer appears as mere earth, but as clothed in celestial light".
Ramakrishna
A mystical experience of Ramakrishna, representing a turning point for them :
"Everything vanished, as if there was nothing anywhere! And what was that I saw? A boundless, endless, conscious ocean of light;...; brilliant rows of waves were roaring towards me"
Yogananda
A few accounts of encounters with the uncreated light, by Yogananda :
"I saw a blinding light, enveloping my body and the entire room"
"a fluid piercing light streaming from every pore;...; my sense of identity was no longer confined to a body but embraced the circumambient atoms"
"I gazed at my arms and moved them back and forth, yet could not feel their weight; ecstatic joy overwhelmed me... the illusion of a solid body was completely dissipated, as my realization deepened that the essence of all things is light"
by is an intensely devotional text of Kashmir Shaivism. Here are some quotes referring to the light of consciousness :
Parameśvara ... "blindingly shining in eternity"
Śañkara ... "infinite light whose essence is the pure ambrosia"
Śiva ... "you are the white-shining essence, origin of every intention, unchanged in each reincarnation"
Abhinavagupta
A few selective quotes from Tantraloka of Abhinavagupta:
"By the means of the splendid light that shines in the immaculate heart, one obtains union with Śiva"
"The yogi who has had the experience of the great light enters into the condition of being of the nature of Śiva"
"The consciousness is formed of light and beatitude"

Pyotr Mikhailovich Yeropkin (ca. 1698–1740) was a Russian architect credited with replanning Saint Petersburg after Peter the Great's death. It was Yeropkin who designed the famous Trident of the Nevsky, Voznesensky, and Gorokhovaya thoroughfares as the city's structural center. They demanded that "no obstacle to the view of the Admiralty spire should be permitted" and insisted on the primacy of the embankments.
The scion of a noble family, Yeropkin was one of the first professionally trained Russian architects. After 8-years study in Italy they worked in St. Petersburg under Domenico Trezzini and Niccolo Michetti. They were a relative of Artemy Volynsky, one of Empress Anne's closest advisors, and built the notorious ice palace on their request. Among their major commissions were the palaces for Chancellor Osterman, Prince Tcherkassky, and Volynsky. After Volynsky's fall from grace they were tried and executed with him.
Empress Elizabeth had a monument erected to Yeropkin's memory near their tomb in St. Sampson's Cathedral. The current memorial by Alexander Opekushin was raised in the late 19th century at the behest of historian Mikhail Semevsky. No buildings by Yeropkin survive, but they are still remembered as the first ethnically Russian town-planner and the first translator of Palladio's books into Russian.

Renato Ziggiotti (October 9, 1892 in – April 19, 1983) was a Roman Catholic priest of the Salesians of Don Bosco, who was the fifth Rector Major of that order, serving between 1952 and 1965. Before becoming a Salesian religious, Ziggiotti was in the military. They were the last Salesian Superior before the Second Vatican Council and the first Superior to resign the position in the Salesian history – all their predecessors died incumbent. They were also the first Rector Major to visit all the countries where there were Salesians present in the five continents, at a time when international transport was very limited.
Life
Ziggiotti was born in Campodoro, Padua, Italy in 1892 and did their first studies at the Salesian College of Este. In 1908 they joined the Salesian Novitiate in Foglizzo and did their first religious votes before Don Rua on September 15, 1909. They became assistant of the Valdocco's youth center (Oratorio) and teacher in a Salesian school of Verona in 1912.
When World War I began in 1914, Ziggiotti was enlisted in the army, as were many other Salesian young men. They were sent to battle in June 1915. In 1917 they were wounded in an arm and remained in the hospital for several months, a time they used to study theology. In April 1919 they terminated in the army with the grade of Captain and returned to Padua to continue priestly studies, to be ordained on December 8, 1920.
They offered themselves to Missions abroad: In 1921 to Ecuador, in 1923 to Australia, and finally in 1924 to Japan, but there were always some reasons to remain in Italy.
In 1931 they were elected superior of the Central Italian Province, and General Councilor for Schools in 1937.
During World War II Ziggiotti led the services of relief at Turin, a city that was an especial object of bombings, that put at risk the works of Don Bosco. Ziggiotti rescued several historical documents from fire in Valdocco.
Rector Major
During the General Chapter of the Salesians, they were elected the fifth Successor of Don Bosco and the first superior out of the Piedmont region. They were also the first Rector Major who did not know Don Bosco personally – they were born in 1892, five years after the death of Don Bosco.
As Superior, they committed themselves to visit all Salesian communities around the world, in a time when international travel was more limited and Europe was devastated by the war. It was their intention to bring the Successor of Don Bosco to all corners of the planet, fulfilling the dreams of the Founder and fulfilling their own missionary dreams.
In 1953 they visited the Salesian houses of Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Spain and Portugal.
In 1954 they visited Belgium, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Ireland.
On June 12, 1954, the Pope canonized Saint Dominic Savio. In 1955 they visited Egypt], Jordan, Syria, Iran, Libyan, India, Myanmar, [Thailand, [Hong Kong], Macao, Philippines, Japan, Australia, United States and Canada.
In 1956 they visited Central America, Antilles, Mexico and Argentina. The Argentinian government gave them the title "Honorable Guest" and "Chief of Honor" of the Ona people.
In 1957 they visited Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil.
In 1959 the relics of Don Bosco were brought to Rome for veneration. Construction began on a church on Colle Don Bosco.
In 1960 they visited Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.
In 1962 Pope John XXIII established the Pontifical Salesian Ateneo and opened the Second Vatican Council that Ziggiotti attended in its three first sessions. Salesian Fr. Egidio Viganò was also invited to participate in that event.
In 1965 Ziggiotti asked the Salesian General Council to elect a new Rector Major, being the first time that it happened in the Salesian history. After their resignation, they went to I Becchi.

Charbel Makhlouf, O.L.M. (, May 8, 1828 – December 24, 1898), also known as Saint Charbel Makhlouf or Sharbel Maklouf, was a Maronite monk and priest from Lebanon. During their life, they obtained a wide reputation for holiness, and for their ability to unite Christians and Muslims.  They are venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church.
 They are known among Lebanese Christians as the "Miracle Monk of Lebanon" because of the favours received through their intercession, especially after prayers are said at their tomb in the Monastery of Saint Maron in Annaya, Lebanon.
Life
Early life
Youssef Antoun Makhlouf was born on May 8, 1828, one of five children, in the mountain village of Bekaa Kafra, the highest by elevation in Lebanon. Their father, Antoun Zaarour Makhlouf, was a mule driver who died in August 1831 while returning from corvée for the Turkish army, leaving their wife Brigitta (née Chidiac) a widow to care for their children. They remarried a man who went on to Holy Orders and became the parish priest of Bekaa Kafra.
Makhlouf was raised in this pious home, and became drawn to the lives of the saints and the eremitical life practiced by two of their uncles. As a young boy, they were responsible for the family's small herd of cows. They would take the herd to a nearby grotto, where they had enshrined an icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary. They would spend the day in prayer.
Monk
In 1851, Makhlouf left their family to begin training as a monk of the Lebanese Maronite Order at the Monastery of Our Lady in Mayfouq. They later transferred to the Monastery of Saint Maron in Annaya, in the Byblos District near Beirut. Here, they received their habit and took the religious name Charbel, after the 2nd-century Christian martyr of Antioch. They made their final religious profession in the Order on November 1, 1853.
As a young monk, Makhlouf began to prepare themselves for ordination by studying philosophy and theology at the Monastery of Saints Cyprian and Justina in Kfifan, Batroun District. Among their professors at the seminary was Nimatullah Kassab, who was themselves later also declared a saint. They were ordained six years later, on July 23, 1859, in Bkerke. They were sent back to the Monastery of Saint Maron, where they lived a life of severe asceticism.
Eremitical life
In 1875, Charbel was granted by the abbot of the monastery the privilege of living as a hermit at the Hermitage of Saints Peter and Paul, a chapel under the care of the monastery. They spent the next 23 years living alone until their death from a stroke on December 24, 1898.<ref>Hovannisian, R & Sabagh, G.; Religion and culture in medieval Islam', Cambridge University Press, 1999, p113</ref>
Death and relics
Makhlouf was interred at the Monastery of Saint Maron on Christmas Day that year. It was reported that during the transport of their corpse, inclement weather conditions hindered the pallbearers in carrying out their duty.
"Father Charbel died on the eve of Christmas; the snow was heavy. We transferred them to the monastery on Christmas day. Before we moved him, the snow was falling rapidly and the clouds were very dark. When we carried him, the clouds disappeared, and the weather cleared."
– George Emmanuel Abi-Saseen, one of the pallbearers
One story claims: "A few months after their death, a bright light was seen surrounding their tomb and the superiors opened it to find their body still intact. After that day, a blood-like liquid flowed from their body. Experts and doctors were unable to give medical explanations for the incorruptibility and flexibility." In 1950 and 1952, their tomb was opened and their body still had the appearance of a living one. Additionally, the 1950 television tape of their exhumation showed Makhlouf's body as still intact, despite the grave having become severely rusty. The official site mentions: In this century their grave has been opened four times, the last time being in 1955, and each time "it has been noticed that their bleeding body still has its flexibility as if it were alive”. The Catholic Tradition website says: "Father Joseph Mahfouz, the postulator of the cause, certified that in 1965 the body of Saint Charbel was still preserved intact with no alteration. In 1976, they again witnessed the opening of the grave; this time the body was completely decomposed. Only the skeleton remained."
On 2 September 2017, Saint Charbel's relics were translated to Saint Elisabeth Cathedral in Košice, Slovakia, where a monthly pilgrimage is held, called "Púť k sv. Šarbelovi" (Pilgrimage to St. Charbel). The cathedral is the first in Slovakia to receive their official relics from Lebanon, and attracts pilgrims from across the country as well as neighbouring states like Poland, Ukraine and Czech Republic.
Veneration
On December 5, 1965, Pope Paul VI presided over the beatification of Makhlouf at the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council. The pope said: “A hermit of Mount Lebanon is enrolled in the number of the blessed… a new eminent member of monastic sanctity has by their example and their intercession enriched the entire Christian people … may they make us understand, in a world largely fascinated by wealth and comfort, the paramount value of poverty, penance and asceticism, to liberate the soul in its ascent to God.”
On October 9, 1977, the pontiff canonized Makhlouf. At the time, Bishop Francis Zayek, wrote, “St. Sharbel is called the second St. Anthony of the Desert, the Perfume of Lebanon, the first Confessor of the East to be raised to the Altars according to the actual procedure of the Catholic Church, the honor of our Aramaic Antiochian Church, and the model of spiritual values and renewal. Sharbel is like a Cedar of Lebanon standing in eternal prayer, on top of a mountain.” Reflecting on the canonization of Makhlouf and the causes for canonization of other Maronites active at the time, Zayek further proclaimed “the Aramaic Maronite Antiochian Church is indeed a living branch of the Catholic Church and is intimately connected with the trunk, who is Christ, our Savior, the beginning and the end of all things.”[Canonisation de Charbel Makhlouf, Homélie du pape Paul VI,Dimanche, 9 octobre 1977] vatican.va, article in French
Owing to their role as a Maronite Saint as well as their piety and morals, Makhlouf serves as a role model for many Maronite Catholics and is venerated by Catholics from all sui iuris churches in communion with Rome.
On October 28, 2017, a shrine dedicated to Makhlouf was inaugurated at Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The Lebanese Maronite Patriarch, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, attended the inauguration ceremony giving their blessing and a dedication, as well as Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. The shrine has a mosaic of Makhlouf along with national emblems of Lebanon such as the cedar and a relic of Makhlouf. It was donated by SGBL Bank chairperson Antoun Sehnaoui in the name of their parents, May and Nabil Sehnaoui.

Miracles
Among the many miracles attributed to Makhlouf, the Catholic Church chose two to confirm their beatification, and a third for their canonization:
the healing of Sister Mary Abel Kamari of the Sacred Hearts;
the healing of Iskandar Naim Obeid from Baabdat; and
the healing of Mariam Awad from Hammana.
A great number of other miracles have been attributed to Makhlouf since their death. The most famous is that of Nohad El Shami, a 55-year-old woman at the time of the miracle who was healed from partial paralysis. They tell that on the night of January 22, 1993, they dreamt of two Maronite monks standing next to their bed. One put their hands on their neck and operated on her, relieving them from their pain, while the other held a pillow behind their back. When they awoke, they found two wounds in their neck, one on each side. They were completely healed and recovered their ability to walk. They believed it was the saint who healed her, but did not recognize the other monk. The next night, they dreamt of Makhlouf, who said: "I did the surgery to let people see and return to faith. I ask you to visit the hermitage on the 22nd of every month, and attend Mass regularly for the rest of your life”. People now gather on the 22nd of each month to pray and attend Mass in the hermitage of Saint Charbel in Annaya.Nohad El Shami, Marcharbel.com
In 1994, a Lebanese Maronite Catholic named Raymond Nader was praying at the hermitage in Annaya when they had a mystical experience. “I found myself in another world…I saw a strange and amazing Light unlike any light I had ever seen; it was a sea of light that extended from one end of the universe to the other. I wanted that Light to stay permanently.” After the vision, Nader was leaving when their arm felt hot and itchy near the statue of Saint Charbel. When they rolled up their sleeve in their car, they saw the imprint of five fingers. “They were engraved like a hand on my arm and encircled by a red glare as if imprinted through fire. But I felt nothing but warmth.”
Dr. Nabil Hokayem, a plastic surgeon from Beirut, examined the mark and believed it was a third-degree burn despite not causing Nader pain. The mark has since repeatedly faded and returned. Inspired by their experience, in 1995 Nader began a prayer group called the Family of Saint Sharbel. Its mission is “to contribute to the Catholic Church's evangelizing mission through living the spirituality of Saint Sharbel in the world.” Nader claims Saint Charbel has appeared to them many more times, and 16 of the saint's locutions to Nader have been published.

The Heat is a 2013 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Paul Feig and written by Katie Dippold. It stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy with Demián Bichir, Marlon Wayans, Michael Rapaport and Jane Curtin in supporting roles. The film centers on FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn and Boston Detective Shannon Mullins, who must take down a mobster in Boston.
The film was released in the United States on June 28, 2013. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry and performances of Bullock and McCarthy, but called the film's plot predictable. It was a success at the box office, grossing $229 million worldwide against a $43 million budget.
Plot
FBI agent Sarah Ashburn is an expert investigator in New York City.  They are disliked by other agents for their uptight and arrogant personality. Them supervisor, who is considering them for promotion, assigns them to a mission in Boston. They meet Boston Police Department detective Shannon Mullins, who is skilled but loudmouthed, foul mouthed and hot-headed. The two women's professional styles clash horribly during their attempt to interrogate a local drug dealer. Ashburn reluctantly agrees to work with Mullins.
Ashburn and Mullins tail a local nightclub manager to their business, Club Ekko, and place a bug on their phone to get information on a drug lord named Simon Larkin. Leaving the club, Ashburn and Mullins are confronted by DEA agents Craig and Adam, who've been working the Larkin case for months. The women discover a surveillance video in the DEA agents' van showing that Mullins' brother, Jason, recently released from prison where Mullins had sent him, appears to be connected to Larkin.
Ashburn convinces Mullins to go to their parents' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. The whole family is angry with Mullins for arresting their brother, but Jason tips Mullins off about the body of a murdered drug dealer. Chemicals on the victim's shoes lead the women to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by Julian Vincent, second-in-command of Larkin's organization. They apprehend Julian after a confrontation with the nightclub manager, but get no information on Larkin's whereabouts, despite Mullins threatening to shoot Julian's genitals.
The women spend the evening bonding in a bar. A drunk Ashburn reveals that their foster child past is to blame for their bad attitude. The next morning Ashburn discovers that they have given their car away to one of the bar patrons, but when they start the car, it explodes.
Julian has escaped from custody and intends to harm Mullins' family, so Mullins moves them into a motel. Jason tries to join the Larkin organization in an attempt to help Mullins solve the case. They give them a tip about a drug shipment coming in. Despite Mullins' reluctance, Ashburn calls in the FBI, which discovers that it is only a pleasure cruise ship. Larkin shoots Jason for informing the FBI about the supposed drug shipment. Jason is rendered comatose. Mullins and Ashburn fall out, with Mullins vowing to bring their brother's attacker to justice. They reconcile after arresting several drug dealers as they try to ascertain Larkin's whereabouts.
The women equip themselves with assault weapons from Mullins' extensive personal arsenal, and infiltrate one of Larkin's warehouses, but they are captured and bound. Julian is about to torture them with knives when they get called away by Larkin. Before Julian leaves, they stab Ashburn in the leg and leaves the knife in the wound. Mullins removes the knife from Ashburn's leg and uses it to cut the rope binding their hands. Before they can cut the rope around their feet, they hear someone coming and Mullins puts the knife back in Ashburn's leg. But it's Craig and Adam who enter. Craig begins to untie the two women, but as they realise Adam is Larkin, Adam shoots Craig before they draw their gun. Adam/Larkin has been working their own case from inside the DEA for several months.
Julian returns and Larkin orders them to kill Ashburn and Mullins while they go to the hospital to kill Jason. Mullins had put their arms behind their chair so they look tied up. After Larkin leaves, Mullins frees herself, grabs the knife in Ashburn's leg and attacks Julian first. Ashburn throws themselves to the floor whilst tied to their chair and they fall. Julian then grabs Ashburn around the throat and threatens to slit their throat as Mullins raises a gun. Ashburn head butts Julian backwards and incapacitates him. The duo race to the hospital to save Jason.
Upon their arrival, Mullins searches for Jason; Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in their leg, lags behind. Mullins finds Jason's room, but is disarmed by Larkin, who is about to kill Jason. Ashburn appears and subdues Larkin by shooting them in the genitals. Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI's Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins.
Jason is shown having fully recovered from their coma. Mullins receives a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Members of their family are present, and they all cheer for them Mullins has signed the back of Ashburn's yearbook, "Foster kid, now you have a sister".
Cast
Production
The Heat is screenwriter Katie Dippold's feature film debut. Dippold wrote the spec script on the side while fulfilling writing duties on Parks and Recreation and, ultimately, it sold to producer Peter Chernin for $600,000 prior to even being presented to prospective bidders. Inspired by the buddy cop film genre, primarily examples such as Running Scared (1986) and Lethal Weapon (1987), Dippold set out to write a film in which the leads were portrayed by women. As Dippold explains, "[In] Running Scared, they go down to the Caribbean and there's this montage of them on scooters, and there's a different hot girl on the back every time it cuts back to the scooter. And it just felt like, I don't want to be the girl on the back of the scooter. I want to be the awesome cop doing this stuff."
Despite the success of Bridesmaids (2011), studio executives were still uncertain of an action film with a female-led cast. "There were people suspicious of this attempt, who thought girls won't want to see a cop action movie and guys won't want to see two girls holding guns and we'd cancel out our potential audience," said producer Jenno Topping. "But we really believed, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be about gender as much as it would be about delivering a courageous action comedy with some heart to it."
On May 19, 2012, director Paul Feig and actores Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy signed on to the film after previously struggling to close deals due to scheduling and payment conflicts. At this time, the film was called The Untitled Female Buddy Cop Comedy.
Principal photography for The Heat began on July 5, 2012, at then-Dudley Square (now Nubian Square) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Music
The soundtrack is composed by Michael Andrews who previously scored Feig's Bridesmaids and Unaccompanied Minors (2006). A soundtrack album containing songs featured in the film was released on June 25, 2013 by Lakeshore Records. Of these songs, the album includes a brand-new track entitled "Rock This" by Santigold. Describing why they chose the songs featured in the film, Feig said, "My favorite part of filmmaking is finding the perfect music to complement what's happening on screen. And I wanted The Heat to feel like a party. I wanted the audience to have fun. And since I have to watch a movie hundreds of times as I'm making it, I wanted to use music that I wouldn't get tired of. Every song in this film is a desert island song for me. I will never get sick of them."
Release
While originally intended to be released on April 5, 2013, Fox pushed back the release date to June 28, 2013. The film held its world premiere in New York City on June 23, 2013.
Marketing
The first official full-length trailer of the film was released on October 27, 2012.
Home media
The Heat was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on October 15, 2013. The Blu-ray features an unrated version of the film, along with several audio commentaries: one with McCarthy and director Feig; one with the actors who portray the Mullins family; and one with the original Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew.
Reception
Box office
The Heat grossed $159.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $70.3 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $229.9 million, against a production budget of $43 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film made a net profit of $61.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.
The film earned $39.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office behind Monsters University.
Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 66%, based on 183 reviews with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Heat is predictable, but Melissa McCarthy is reliably funny and Sandra Bullock proves a capable foil." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.
Positive reviews lauded Bullock and McCarthy's comedic performances. Critic Christy Lemire wrote, “the first produced script from Katie Dippold gives them a smart, inspired and wickedly funny foundation from which to work, and they and Bullock enjoy gangbusters chemistry with each other.”
Wesley Morris wrote in Grantland, “My skepticism going in had to do with The Heat being a movie with two female characters that easily could have been played by a pair of men. But these two are like workplace sexism's toxic side effects. Ashburn is the ambitious professional who lives only for promotions. Mullins is the anti-feminine ballbuster. Nobody likes either of them. And they don't like each other until they do. This is generic genre stuff with a realish female friendship at its center: It's a bra-mance.”
Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of B and wrote, “The director, Paul Feig, possesses a highly developed radar for the alternating currents of competition and camaraderie in female relationships. As they proved in Bridesmaids (2011)…Feig understands how women who don't like each other express their antipathy — in ways both more direct and less direct than what men do. In The Heat, Feig stages scenes like Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) with a touch of George Cukor (The Women). They have made a piece of smash-and-grab policier pulp that, through the interplay of Bullock and McCarthy, spins to its own snarly/confessional feminine beat.”
In contrast, Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle called the film both formulaic and inspired, but acknowledged "the inspiration is in the combining of these two actores."
In another mixed review, Keith Uhlich of Time Out said Bullock and McCarthy deserved better material, and also criticized the trailer for giving the impression that this was a less funny film.
Accolades
Cancelled sequel and proposed spin-off
Shortly after the film's release, director Feig announced that the film would be followed by a sequel. In October 2013, Bullock stated that they won't come back for the sequel and the project itself was put on hold. Instead, the sequel was reportedly being replaced by a spin-off film that will centre around Jamie Denbo and Jessica Chaffin's characters Beth and Gina from the first film.

Toni Braxton is the debut studio album by American singer Toni Braxton, released on July 13, 1993, by LaFace Records and Arista Records. The album was primarily produced by L.A. Reid, Babyface, and Daryl Simmons.
Background
Braxton and their four sisters Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar signed with Arista Records as The Braxtons in 1989. The following year, the group released their debut single, "Good Life". Though the song was commercially unsuccessful, it attracted the attention of record executive Antonio "L.A." Reid and record producer Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, who were shopping around for talent for their new label LaFace Records. Instead of signing the quintet, they opted to offer Braxton a contract as a solo artist. With only one year to finish at Bowie State University, where they were studying to become a music teacher, they relocated to Atlanta to pursue a singing career.
Release
The first single, "Another Sad Love Song", peaked at numbers seven and two on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. The album's second single, "Breathe Again", reached the top five of both the Hot 100 and R&B charts and at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Other singles were released from Toni Braxton in 1994, including "You Mean the World to Me", "Seven Whole Days", and the double A-side "I Belong to You"/"How Many Ways".
In Japan, the album was released as Love Affair, also a song on the album. The Japanese edition contains the same track listing as the standard version; the only difference is the Obi strip and the bonus lyrics booklet written in Japanese.
Critical reception
Toni Braxton received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Ron Wynn from AllMusic said that the album showcased Braxton as "an elegant and earthy songstress, nicely balancing those seemingly divergent sentiments [...] Braxton's husky, enticing voice sounds hypnotic, dismayed, and disillusioned [...] but she's never out of control, indignant, or so anguished and hurt that they fail to retain their dignity." Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: "Sounding like an unlikely hybrid of Phyllis Hyman, Anita Baker and Tracy Chapman, Braxton's sultry, earthy delivery makes them a standout in today's R&B arena." Similarly, People found that "when Braxton slides into their lower register they echo Anita Baker, and when they skip around the higher notes there's also a hint of Whitney Houston. The influences are there, but Toni Braxton is most definitely their own woman. On this sophisticated, stylish and soulful album, they slate them case."
Mitchell May, writing for the Chicago Tribune, noted that "Braxton wisely lets the mood of a tune dictate their approach, allowing them to supply an emotional depth that perhaps even the songwriters didn't know was there." They also found, however, that "the disc loses steam around midpoint." In a mixed review, Rolling Stone journalist John McAlley felt that "Braxton has got chops and spunk... And, yes, there are a handful of songs in which they get to do the do. But there's not a poet in the house among LaFace's family of writer-producers – no Smokey Robinson, no Linda Creed. And for all its polish, too much of the music on Toni Braxton mistakes melodrama for passion and set pieces for soul." Marisa Fox of Entertainment Weekly found much of the album "generic" and concluded that Braxton "can sing, but there's nothing in their songs or delivery to set them apart from any number of wine-cooler R&B divas." Village Voice critic Robert Christgau gave the album a "neither" rating in their Consumer Guide book.
Accolades
The album earned Braxton several awards, including three Grammy Awards (for Best New Artist and two consecutive awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 1994 and 1995). They also won two American Music Awards (for Favorite Soul/R&B New Artist and Favorite New Adult Contemporary Artist) in 1994 and another one in 1995 (for Favorite Soul/R&B Album).
Commercial performance
Toni Braxton debuted at number 36 on the Billboard 200 for the week ending July 31, 1993. Following Braxton's appearance at the American Music Awards of 1994, the album rose from number seven to number one in its 31st week on the chart, on the issue dated February 26, 1994, becoming the first number-one album for LaFace Records. It spent a second non-consecutive week atop the Billboard 200 for the week ending March 19, 1994, following the 36th Annual Grammy Awards. The album has sold 5,135,000 copies in the United States and 10 million copies worldwide.

LibreLogo is an integrated development environment (IDE) for computer programming in the programming language Python, which works like the language Logo using interactive vector turtle graphics. Its final output is a vector graphics rendition within the LibreOffice suite. It can be used for education and desktop publishing.
History
Logo toolbar and interpreter was programmed by László Németh, and help with integration was provided by András Tímár. It was released as an extension to LibreOffice before code was merged into LibreOffice 4.2.3.3 main code in 2014.
The lightweight implementation (1,400 lines in Python-PyUNO) uses the embedded Python to give a simplified programming interface to the vector graphics of LibreOffice for graphic design and education (including teaching of word processing).
Installation
LibreLogo is embedded in every version of LibreOffice after 4.2.3.3, released in 2014. It can also be installed as an extension for earlier versions.
Its main UI is a toolbar in Writer ().

Clay minerals are hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates, sometimes with variable amounts of iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and other cations found on or near some planetary surfaces.
Clay minerals form in the presence of water and have been important to life, and many theories of abiogenesis involve them. They are important constituents of soils, and have been useful to humans since ancient times in agriculture and manufacturing.
Properties
Clay is a very fine-grained geologic material that develops plasticity when wet, but becomes hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing. It is a very common material, and is the oldest known ceramic. Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay and used it for making pottery. The chemistry of clay, including its capacity to retain nutrient cations such as potassium and ammonium, is important to soil fertility.
Because the individual particles in clay are less than in size, they cannot be characterized by ordinary optical or physical methods. The crystallographic structure of clay minerals became better understood in the 1930s with advancements in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique indispensable to deciphering their crystal lattice. Clay particles were found to be predominantly sheet silicate (phyllosilicate) minerals, now grouped together as clay minerals. Their structure is based on flat hexagonal sheets similar to those of the mica group of minerals. Standardization in terminology arose during this period as well, with special attention given to similar words that resulted in confusion, such as sheet and plane.
Because clay minerals are usually (but not necessarily) ultrafine-grained, special analytical techniques are required for their identification and study. In addition to X-ray crystallography, these include electron diffraction methods, various spectroscopic methods such as Mössbauer spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-EDS or automated mineralogy processes. These methods can be augmented by polarized light microscopy, a traditional technique establishing fundamental occurrences or petrologic relationships.
Occurrence
Clay minerals are common weathering products (including weathering of feldspar) and low-temperature hydrothermal alteration products. Clay minerals are very common in soils, in fine-grained sedimentary rocks such as shale, mudstone, and siltstone and in fine-grained metamorphic slate and phyllite.
Given the requirement of water, clay minerals are relatively rare in the Solar System, though they occur extensively on Earth where water has interacted with other minerals and organic matter. Clay minerals have been detected at several locations on Mars, including Echus Chasma, Mawrth Vallis, the Memnonia quadrangle and the Elysium quadrangle. Spectrography has confirmed their presence on asteroids including the dwarf planet Ceres and Tempel 1, as well as Jupiter's moon Europa.
Structure
Like all phyllosilicates, clay minerals are characterised by two-dimensional sheets of corner-sharing tetrahedra or octahedra. The sheet units have the chemical composition . Each silica tetrahedron shares three of its vertex oxygen ions with other tetrahedra, forming a hexagonal array in two dimensions. The fourth oxygen ion is not shared with another tetrahedron and all of the tetrahedra "point" in the same direction; i.e. all of the unshared oxygen ions are on the same side of the sheet. These unshared oxygen ions are called apical oxygen ions.
In clays, the tetrahedral sheets are always bonded to octahedral sheets formed from small cations, such as aluminum or magnesium, and coordinated by six oxygen atoms. The unshared vertex from the tetrahedral sheet also forms part of one side of the octahedral sheet, but an additional oxygen atom is located above the gap in the tetrahedral sheet at the center of the six tetrahedra. This oxygen atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom forming an OH group in the clay structure. Clays can be categorized depending on the way that tetrahedral and octahedral sheets are packaged into layers. If there is only one tetrahedral and one octahedral group in each layer the clay is known as a 1:1 clay. The alternative, known as a 2:1 clay, has two tetrahedral sheets with the unshared vertex of each sheet pointing towards each other and forming each side of the octahedral sheet.
Bonding between the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets requires that the tetrahedral sheet becomes corrugated or twisted, causing ditrigonal distortion to the hexagonal array, and the octahedral sheet is flattened. This minimizes the overall bond-valence distortions of the crystallite.
Depending on the composition of the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets, the layer will have no charge or will have a net negative charge. If the layers are charged this charge is balanced by interlayer cations such as Na+ or K+ or by a lone octahedral sheet. The interlayer may also contain water. The crystal structure is formed from a stack of layers interspaced with the interlayers.
Classification
Clay minerals can be classified as 1:1 or 2:1. A 1:1 clay would consist of one tetrahedral sheet and one octahedral sheet, and examples would be kaolinite and serpentinite. A 2:1 clay consists of an octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets, and examples are talc, vermiculite, and montmorillonite. The layers in 1:1 clays are uncharged and are bonded by hydrogen bonds between layers, but 2:1 layers have a net negative charge and may be bonded together either by individual cations (such as potassium in illite or sodium or calcium in smectites) or by positively charged octahedral sheets (as in chlorites).
Clay minerals include the following groups:
Kaolin group which includes the minerals kaolinite, dickite, halloysite, and nacrite (polymorphs of ).
Some sources include the kaolinite-serpentine group due to structural similarities.
Smectite group which includes dioctahedral smectites, such as montmorillonite, nontronite and beidellite, and trioctahedral smectites, such as saponite. In 2013, analytical tests by the Curiosity rover found results consistent with the presence of smectite clay minerals on the planet Mars.
Illite group which includes the clay-micas. Illite is the only common mineral in this group.
Chlorite group includes a wide variety of similar minerals with considerable chemical variation.
Other 2:1 clay types exist such as palygorskite (also known as attapulgite) and sepiolite, clays with long water channels internal to their structure.
Mixed layer clay variations exist for most of the above groups. Ordering is described as a random or regular order and is further described by the term reichweite, which is German for range or reach. Literature articles will refer to an R1 ordered illite-smectite, for example. This type would be ordered in an illite-smectite-illite-smectite (ISIS) fashion. R0 on the other hand describes random ordering, and other advanced ordering types are also found (R3, etc.). Mixed layer clay minerals which are perfect R1 types often get their own names. R1 ordered chlorite-smectite is known as corrensite, R1 illite-smectite is rectorite.
X-ray rf(001) is the spacing between layers in nanometers, as determined by X-ray crystallography. Glycol (mg/g) is the adsorption capacity for glycol, which occupies the interlayer sites when the clay is exposed to a vapor of ethylene glycol at for eight hours. CEC is the cation exchange capacity of the clay. (%) is the percent content of potassium oxide in the clay. DTA describes the differential thermal analysis curve of the clay.
Clay and the origins of life
Biomedical applications of clays
The structural and compositional versatility of clay minerals gives them interesting biological properties. Due to disc-shaped and charged surfaces, clay interacts with a range of drugs, protein, polymers, DNA, or other macromolecules. Some of the applications of clays include drug delivery, tissue engineering, and bioprinting.
Mortar applications
Clay minerals can be incorporated in lime-metakaolin mortars to improve mechanical properties. Electrochemical separation helps to obtain modified saponite-containing products with high smectite-group minerals concentrations, lower mineral particles size, more compact structure, and greater surface area. These characteristics open possibilities for the manufacture of high-quality ceramics and heavy-metal sorbents from saponite-containing products.
Furthermore, tail grinding occurs during the preparation of the raw material for ceramics; this waste reprocessing is of high importance for the use of clay pulp as a neutralizing agent, as fine particles are required for the reaction. Experiments on the histosol deacidification with the alkaline clay slurry demonstrated that neutralization with the average pH level of 7.1 is reached at 30% of the pulp added and an experimental site with perennial grasses proved the efficacy of the technique. Moreover, the reclamation of disturbed lands is an integral part of the social and environmental responsibility of the mining company and this scenario addresses the community necessities at both local and regional levels.
The tests which of to verify that clay minerals are present
The results of glycol adsorption, cation exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and chemical tests all give data that may be used for quantitative estimations. After the quantities of organic matter, carbonates, free oxides, and nonclay minerals have been determined, the percentages of clay minerals are estimated using the appropriate glycol adsorption, cation exchange capacity, K20, and DTA data. The amount of illite is estimated from the K20 content since this is the only clay mineral containing potassium.
Argillaceous rocks
Argillaceous rocks are those in which clay minerals are a significant component. For example, argillaceous limestones are limestones consisting predominantly of calcium carbonate, but including 10-40% of clay minerals: such limestones, when soft, are often called marls. Similarly, argillaceous sandstones such as greywacke, are sandstones consisting primarily of quartz grains, with the interstitial spaces filled with clay minerals.

or , anglicised as Fulteachs, futtick, furtock etc., is a Scottish Gaelic term which originally referred to a certain period in the agricultural calendar and which refers to the first month of the year, January, in the modern language.
Nowadays, the term has fallen out of English and Lowland Scots, but is still used in Gaelic for the month of January specifically. It would appear to be a very old term, as it seems to come from or meaning a wolf, a creature which has been extinct in Scotland for centuries.
The Gael of old regarded stormy weather towards the end of January as prognostic of a fruitful season to follow, or vice versa, as shown in various proverbs.
Variations
In Lewis, fell on the Friday nearest to three weeks before the end of January, and ended on the Tuesday nearest the end of the third week of February. It was said to be three weeks of winter, and three weeks of spring.
A shorter consisted of the last fortnight of winter, and the first fortnight of spring, in the Old Style calendar, proverbial for its variable weather. Sometimes the first half was called (Winter ), and the second half (Spring ).
is also used to mean the equinoxes according to Dwelly, presumably the vernal equinox.
Proverbs
"In , the three furrows side by side should be full of water, full of snow, and full of house thatch." (presumably referring to climate and growth)
"For every mavis that sings in , she'll lament seven times ere spring be over."
"It comes on Friday and goes on Tuesday."
John Jamieson records another saying:
"they wish the in with an adder's head, and to go out with a peacock's tail, i.e. to be stormy in the beginning, and mild towards the end."
This is very similar to the Highland sentiments.

Jason Khalipa (born October 2, 1985 in San Jose, California) is an American former professional CrossFit Games athlete known for their accomplishments as the 2008 CrossFit Games champion.
They also received the Spirit of the Games award at the 2009 CrossFit Games and was selected to participate as a member of Team USA at the CrossFit Invitational in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
Khalipa is the founder and CEO of NCFit headquartered in Campbell, California.
Personal life
Khalipa was born in San Jose, California, and attended Archbishop Mitty High School where they played for the varsity football team as a nose guard. They also participated in track and field for the shot put event. Khalipa began their fitness career in high school by working part time as the front desk representative at Milpitas Health and Fitness, a gym in Milpitas, California. After high school, they attended college at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California, but they did not participate in organized sports. They continued working full-time at Milpitas Health and Fitness where they trained for their first CrossFit Games and devoted the rest of their time on their education, graduating with a Bachelors of Arts in Business Management. Khalipa opened their first gym, CrossFit Santa Clara nearly a month after winning their first CrossFit Games in 2008. Khalipa's recognition grew in the CrossFit world and wrote As Much Reps As Possible about their career. They became dedicated to learning more about health and fitness as a competitor and a coach. They renamed CrossFit Santa Clara to NorCal CrossFit in 2011 and then renamed again in 2017 to NCFit.
In January 2016, Khalipa's daughter Ava was diagnosed with leukemia. After Ava's final treatment in 2018, Khalipa and their wife Ashley have since focused on spreading awareness for pediatric cancer.
In June 2020, Khalipa announced NCFits disaffiliation from the CrossFit brand, following then-CEO Greg Glassman's controversial posts on Twitter in 2020.
Athletic career
Khalipa competed in eight CrossFit Games competitions throughout their professional career, winning their first in 2008 where they placed first. As the champion of the 2008 CrossFit Games, they automatically qualified in the 2009 CrossFit Games where they placed fifth and earned the Spirit of the Games award. From 2010 to 2015, Khalipa continued to place first in CrossFit Regional events and once during the CrossFit Open, which was a world-wide event, but they did not place first overall in another CrossFit Games. In 2015, they competed as a team member with their affiliate, NorCal CrossFit, in the team competition. They decided not to compete in the 2016 CrossFit Games to take care of their daughter following their diagnoses with Leukemia. They briefly participated in the 2017 Open, but withdrew after one event. In 2016, Khalipa began training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). They placed first in the adult 208lb division of the US Open Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the Kaiser Permanente Arena in Santa Cruz, California, on October 23, 2016.
Training and diet
Khalipa trained three times a day for a competition. The morning workouts usually consist of aerobic training: bike, row, or run. In the afternoon, they engaged in CrossFit and they reserved the evenings for stamina building in complex skills such as handstands, muscle ups, or Olympic lifts. When Khalipa is not training to compete in CrossFit events, they maintain a regular training schedule that includes daily classes at NCFit and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu two to three days a week to maintain conditioning.
Their diet differs slightly from when they trained for competitions, which was a gluten-free and mostly paleolithic diet. Khalipa replenishes calories with more food more often by eating meats and veggies, and they do not keep track of type, volume, or a macronutrient breakdown.

The Grizzly and the Grizzly 2.0 is a 3D printed .22-caliber rifle created around August 2013. It was created using a Stratasys Dimension 1200es printer. It was created by a Canadian only known by the pseudonym "Matthew" and told The Verge that they are in their late 20s, and their main job is making tools for the construction industry.
The original Grizzly fired 1 shot then broke Grizzly 2.0 fired 14 bullets before getting damaged due to the strain.
Specification
The “Grizzly 2.0″ has 50 percent larger barrel with a rifled bore, a larger receiver and new hammer. In a video posted online by the creator, the Grizzly seemed to have successfully fired a Winchester Dynapoint .22-caliber bullet, like the Liberator .380. The only metal in the Grizzly is a 1-inch roofing nail plus whatever metal is in the cartridge.
Printer
The printer used to make the rifle was a Stratasys Dimension 1200es printer costing $10,000 as of August 2013. It was made using ABS plastic.
"Matthew" said the rifle had taken 3 days to build, and about 27 hours to print it. They revealed it took them 13 hours to print the receiver, 6.5 hours to print the barrel, 5 hours to print the stock and 2 hours to print the rifle's internal parts.

Ichthyolestes ("fish thief") is an extinct genus of archaic cetacean that was endemic to Indo-Pakistan during the Lutetian stage. To date, this monotypic genus is only represented by Ichthyolestes pinfoldi.
Like other members of the family Pakicetidae, which are considered the earliest and least specialized of the archaic cetaceans, Ichthyolestes represents an early quadrupedal phase of the land-to-sea transition which occurs in the cetacean lineage.
Discovery and Classification
I. pinfoldi was initially known only from teeth, which were found in the Eocene locality Ganda Kas, Pakistan. Upon their discovery, I. pinfoldi was placed within the Family Mesonychidae, a group of terrestrial mammals from which cetaceans were previously thought to have evolved. Due to morphological distinctions from other mesonychids, I. pinfoldi was later acknowledged and described as an archaeocete, making it the first Pakicetid to be described.
Cranial and postcranial material of I. pinfoldi have also been found in the Kuldana Formation, Pakistan, from the early-middle Eocene, and from the Subathu sediments of Jammu and Kashmir, India.
Description
Ichthyolestes is the smallest Pakicetid, approximately 29% smaller than Pakicetus, and has been considered “fox-sized.” They retain many features typical of terrestrial Eocene artiodactyls, including long and gracile limb bones, a fused sacrum, small mandibular foramen, and no cranial telescoping. The body plan of Ichthyolestes is generally similar to Pakicetus, but smaller and more gracile. Therefore, locomotion is also thought to be reliant on quadrupedal paddling.
Teeth
Ichthyolestes exhibits heterodont and diphyodont dentition with cusped cheek teeth. The upper second molar has pointed cusps with a high narrow paracone and a lower connate metacone behind it. The molars are also relatively labio-lingually compressed with serrated crests along the labial cusps.
Cranial
Ichthyolestes has dorsally oriented eyes and a narrow skull, which is smaller than the skulls of both Pakicetus and Nalacetus. Like other Pakicetids, Ichthyolestes lacks a supraorbital shield; however, there is some variation in supraorbital morphology between the three genera. The supraorbital region of Ichthyolestes and Pakicetus is cup-like and cradles the dorsal portion of the eye. Ichthyolestes also has a weaker incisure on the dorsal side of the supraorbital region compared to Pakicetus.
All three Pakicetid taxa largely retained the peripheral ear morphology of terrestrial mammals, but likely used bone conducting mechanisms when hearing underwater. The tympanic bulla also differs between Pakicetid taxa. The absolute size of Ichthyolestes tympanic bulla is smaller than either Pakicetus or Nalacetus; but when compared relative to their body size, the tympanic bulla of Ichthyolestes is proportionally larger than that of Pakicetus.
The semicircular canal system of the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is involved in neural control of locomotion, is similar in size to that of Eocene artiodactyls. They do not show the size reduction as seen in other Pakicetids and Eocene cetaceans like Remingtonocetus, Indocetus, and Dorudon, which have canal sizes within the upper range of modern cetaceans. This suggests that Ichthyolestes had not fully invaded aquatic ecosystems and still remained somewhat terrestrial.
Postcranial
Although Ichthyolestes is the smallest Pakicetid, some features are larger or more robust than Nalacetus, such as the astragalus, calcaneus, and pelvis. Ichthyolestes also has proportionally longer lumbar and caudal vertebrae relative to its shorter limb segments.
Ichthyolestes also has long digits and strong post-thoracic vertebrae. The sacrum is composed of four elongate vertebrae with complete fusion, except for the spinous processes of S2 to S4 which are columnar with smooth ventral faces. The lumbar vertebrae are narrower and shallower to Pakicetus and Nalacetus. Although still relatively large compared to other related taxa, the atlas vertebrae of Ichthyolestes is smaller and more gracile than Pakicetus or Nalacetus, and the neural canal is disproportionately large.
Terrestrial or Semi-aquatic Locomotion
The astragalus bone, which is present in the ankle of artiodactyls and archaic whales that retained feet, has similar dimensions in both Eocene artiodactyls and Ichtyolestes. In addition to lending evidence to the theory of a direct relationship between artiodactyls and cetaceans, this knowledge has led to two competing hypotheses about the locomotion of Ichtyolestes and other Pakicetids. The first states that Ichtyolestes and Pakicetus were terrestrial and cursorial, implying that aquatic locomotor adaptation occurred after the origin of Cetacea. The second states that Ichtyolestes and Pakicetus were already semi-aquatic and cetaceans originated from an earlier unknown Eocene artiodactyl, such as Elomeryx or Indohyus, implying that aquatic locomotor adaptations occurred before or during the origin of Cetacea.
Although the postcranial anatomy of Ichtyolestes is similar to that of Eocene artiodactyls and implies cursoriality, the assessment of bone morphology and microstructure indicate that they, and other Pakicetids, were semi-aquatic like Protocetids. Hypermineralization occurs in all regions of the skeleton; in particular, the long bones and ribs had small or absent marrow cavities due to the thick cortices which developed. Hypermineralization of load-bearing skeletal elements put Ichtyolestes at an increased risk of fractures during prolonged terrestrial loading and this risk increased with velocity, implying that terrestriality was limited. Additionally, the dense skeletons may have allowed bottom-walking or wading in shallow pools as it would counteract buoyancy created by inflated lungs and fur-trapped air. Therefore, the retention of an artiodactyl-like astragalus does not signify full terrestriality or cursoriality in Ichtyolestes.
Paleoenvironment
Fossil findings indicate Ichthyolestes shared habitat with its relatives Pakicetus and Nalacetus. Their fossils are usually found around river channel deposits, not marine deposits or fauna. The regions around northern Pakistan and northwest India, where fossils have been recovered, are thought to have been an arid environment with ephemeral streams and moderately developed floodplains. Ichthyolestes, therefore, had an affinity for water and were either terrestrial or semi-aquatic. The fluvial facies of the lower Kuldana Formation represent shallow tropical riverine complexes and were likely habitats for the initial stages of transition into water.

Jackass: The Movie (stylized as jackass the movie) is a 2002 American reality slapstick comedy film directed by Jeff Tremaine. It is a continuation of the MTV television series Jackass, which had completed its run. It was produced by Lynch Siderow Productions and Dickhouse Productions. The film features most of the original Jackass cast, including leader Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Chris Pontius, Ehren McGhehey, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, and Dave England. MTV Films and Paramount Pictures released the film to theaters on October 25, 2002. It grossed over $79 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a sequel, Jackass Number Two (2006).
Synopsis
Jackass: The Movie is a compilation of stunts, skits, and pranks, intercut with on-set talking heads with its cast. The movie begins with the entire main cast riding a giant shopping cart downhill. At the bottom, the guys crash into a fruit stand which sends them flying into the fruit.
The most notable stunts and pranks include Johnny Knoxville getting flipped over in a golf cart, Steve-O snorting wasabi, Bam Margera pranking their mother April by planting a live alligator in their kitchen, Chris Pontius dancing in public while wearing nothing but a thong, Ryan Dunn fighting against a female kickboxing champion, Wee Man menacing around Japan in a giant traffic cone, Ehren McGhehey eating a snow cone made of their own urine, Preston Lacy sitting on a bench which is rigged to collapse in front of unsuspecting bystanders, and Dave England defecating in a display toilet at a hardware store after having an accident in a car where they proceed to uncontrollably defecate in their pants.
The final stunt involves a toy car being inserted into a cast member's anus in order to get it shown in an x-ray. Steve-O was set to do the stunt, but after being told by their father that they would be disowned if they had done it, Ryan Dunn volunteers and ends up doing the stunt. The end result is successful, as it appears once the x-ray has been taken. The toy car is later seen being defecated out in the end credits. This is followed by Johnny Knoxville being launched into a lake via catapult, where comedian Rip Taylor announces that the film has ended.

Production
After the success of the Jackass TV series, Johnny Knoxville was approached by the producers to make it into a feature film. Initially, they rejected the idea as they did not understand the concept; thinking they will get Hollywood actors to portray the cast. They later agreed when both Jeff Tremaine and Spike Jonze explained it will be a "naughtier version" of the TV series.
Bits that were filmed, but got cut out of the theatrical and home media releases include Gene LeBell choking the cast out one by one, Ryan Dunn getting sprayed by bear mace in the face by Bam Margera, Wee Man skating while being dressed as a penis, Preston Lacy getting "fat fuck" trimmed in their hair by cinematographer Dimitry Elyashkevich with hair clippers, Dave England posing as a caricature sketch artist to draw inappropriate drawings, Steve-O pouring beer in their anus with a garden hose (which was later redone in Jackass Number Two), Chris Pontius and Dave England putting a bicycle lock around a crew member's neck, and Ehren McGhehey, Ryan Dunn, Chris Pontius, and Mat Hoffman wakeboarding with BMXs attached to the wakeboards. Some of these deleted bits are briefly shown in the credits and/or the making of Jackass: The Movie. Dave England uploaded the caricature sketch artist bit on their YouTube channel, but it got removed for violating the guidelines.
The original plan for the "Butt X-Ray" was for someone to insert a cellphone up their anus and then getting a call, but it later got changed to a toy car. A scene that was planned but never got filmed due to financial reasons was for Chris Pontius to be dressed up as the devil and going to a Pentecostal church where they handle live snakes.
"Failed ending"
The original ending for the film was supposed to be a Rube Goldberg-type contraption, with each of the cast members performing a stunt that either has something to do with what they did on the show (for example, the first stunt would have Preston Lacy as "The Human Wrecking Ball", knocking them into a Port-A-Potty), or simply for a sight gag (such as Ehren McGhehey being knocked over in the Port-A-Potty and landing on a bed of toilet paper rolls), ending with Johnny being launched off the catapult next to Rip Taylor.
However, as the entire contraption didn't work together the way they wanted it to, the producers of the film decided to try filming an alternate ending, which is how they came to film the "Son of Jackass" skit. The "Son of Jackass" skit (according to the beginning, set in the year 2063) starts almost immediately after Knoxville and Taylor return to the edge of the lake, as Taylor whispers the suggestion into Knoxville's ear, and involves all of the performers in "old man" costumes running around in exploding buildings and sheds, with only Steve-O surviving to proclaim "Yeah, dude." In the cast commentary, it is said that this is ironic as Steve-O is the least likely to even reach old age. Some bits of the failed ending were incorporated into the end credits montage, like Dave England dressed in a penis costume and Wee Man going down the giant Plinko contraption.
Home media
The film was released on DVD on March 25, 2003. The DVD includes 27 minutes of additional footage, outtakes and MTV's "Making of Jackass: The Movie. An unrated version of the film was released in 2006, with a runtime of 87 minutes.
Reception
Box office
The film had a budget of $5 million and was the number one film at the United States box office when it opened, grossing $22.8 million, revenue from 2,509 theaters, for an average of $9,073 per venue. The film fell to fourth place in its second weekend and dropped 44 percent to $12.7 million, expanding to 2,530 theaters and averaging $5,032 per theater. The ten day gross was $42.1 million. The film went on to gross $64.3 million in the United States alone, of which the opening weekend made up 35.43 percent of its final gross. It made $15.2 million in other countries, bringing the worldwide gross to $79.5 million.
Critical response
Rotten Tomatoes reports 49% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "There's a good chance you'll be laughing hysterically at one stunt, but getting grossed out by the next one in this big screen version of the controversial MTV show." On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 42 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews." Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.
Talking on Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper called it the "feel-sick movie of the year" and said the film is "a disgusting, repulsive, grotesque spectacle, but it's also hilarious and provocative. God help me, thumbs up." Roger Ebert gave the film a low rating, but only barely, explaining their rating comes "somewhere between a thumbs down and a sort of 'waving over' recommendation". The Austin Chronicles Kimberly Jones gave the film 3 stars and said it is the "feature-length rendering of jackass the MTV show, meaning no plot, no script, just wall-to-wall idiocy." Jones said "It's silly, often stomach-churning, but also awfully addictive, inspiring the same kind of vicarious adrenaline rush as Fight Club, with its 'I bleed, therefore I am'; he-man mentality." Jones also remarked, "Consisting of a steady clip of barely minutes-long gags...this piece of outré performance art defies typical movie conventions..." Chicago Tribune film reporter Mark Caro gave the film 1 star out of 4 and called it "willful idiocy for idiocy's sake." Caro also said "there's one stunt that I bet none of these moronic daredevils would tackle: trying to say something intelligent about Jackass: The Movie."
Deseret Morning Newss Jeff Vice gave the film 1½ stars and said the 80-minute run time was too much. Vice described the film as "possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio." Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a "B" and said the film "provokes a suspense halfway between comedy and horror. I'm not sure if I enjoyed myself, exactly, but I could hardly wait to see what I'd be appalled by next." Gleiberman also said "In the movie version of the show that might just as well have been called America's Funniest Frat-House Hazing Rituals, the boys engage in infantile Candid Camera grossouts..." Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter, who admitted to having never seen an episode of the TV show, said "it would be easy for me to hold Jackass: The Movie up as a leading example of the decline of Western civilization." Alter said they were disturbed by "the film's, and by extension the audience's, cavalier attitude towards pain."
LA Weekly critic Paul Malcolm listed Jackass: The Movie as one of the 10 best films of 2002 and also called it the most underrated film of the year. Film Threats Pete Vonder Haar said the results of "essentially transplanting the show to the big screen" are "incredibly funny and often too disgusting for words."
The Miami Heralds Rene Rodriguez gave the film 2½ stars out of 4 and said "Johnny Knoxville and their merry band of anarchists ran around performing the sort of suicidal stunts parental warnings were invented for" and "the gang also likes to train their sights on the unsuspecting public, Candid Camera style." New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick said "[this] plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year." Reviewing the film for The New York Times, A.O. Scott said it "is essentially an extended episode of the popular Jackass MTV series" and that "some of the undertakings, amateurishly recorded on video, are like demented science experiments." Scott said "Jackass the Movie is like a documentary version of Fight Club, shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interest".
The Village Voices Ed Halter said "their feature debut plays like a longer episode of the show" and said "it's funny, as the old saying goes, because it's true." Halter wrote "the structure is ruthlessly efficient: no plot, no characters, no sets, and no downtime—just one sight-gag right after another." Scott Foundas of Variety referred to Jackass: The Movie as the first reality film when reviewing The Real Cancun in April 2003.
In a film critic roundup of 2002 films in The Village Voice, film critic Armond White said "Best Documentary: Jackass, far and away." Ed Halter of The Village Voice wrote, "MTV would surely love to claim Jackass as a mutant by-product of its Real World franchise, but its roots lie elsewhere", saying "their self-destructive brand of docu-comedy emerged as a bizarrely elaborate version of a skateboard-video mainstay: slam sections..." Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail said the film "belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category".
Soundtrack
The soundtrack was released on October 25, 2002, by American Recordings. The soundtrack features songs that were featured in the movie, and various audio clips from the movie.
Sequels
Jackass: The Movie was filmed with a modest budget of approximately $5 million, but earned more than $22 million during its opening weekend, effectively managing to secure the top spot at the box office for its debut and immediately making back its budget at least 4 times over. It eventually grossed more than $64 million in North America alone.
Initially meant as the "grand finale" for the series as several cast members, most notably Bam Margera and Steve-O, focused on new shows outside the Jackass brand, the crew ultimately decided to reunite for another film as Steve-O in particular realized part of the reason they did Jackass-style stunts on their programs was because of how much they enjoyed working with the crew.
On September 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures released Jackass Number Two. A feature titled Jackass 2.5 was compiled from outtakes shot during the making of the second film and released direct-to-DVD on December 26, 2007.
In December 2009, Paramount Pictures and MTV Films issued a press release that a second sequel titled Jackass 3D would be made. It was released on October 15, 2010. The movie was filmed in 3D starting in January 2010. Jackass 3.5 was compiled from outtakes shot during the making of the third film. The film was released in weekly installments on Joost from April 1 through June 13, 2011. The entire film was then released direct-to-DVD on June 14, 2011.
In July 2013, a spin-off movie titled Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa was announced. It was released on October 25, 2013, exactly 11 years after Jackass: The Movie came out. Unlike the other Jackass movies, this one has a story and features just Johnny Knoxville dressed as their grandpa character, Irving Zisman. A separate movie titled Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa.5 was made out of unused footage, outtakes, and interviews with the cast and crew members during the making of Bad Grandpa. This film premiered on MTV on June 15, 2014.
In December 2019, a third sequel, Jackass Forever, was announced and scheduled to be released on March 5, 2021, but was eventually delayed for July 2, 2021, and again to September 3, 2021. In April 2021 the movie was delayed again to October 22, 2021. In September 2021, the movie was delayed once more to February 4, 2022. Jackass 4.5 is compiled of outtakes shot during the filming of the fourth movie and was released on Netflix on May 20, 2022.
Legacy
Japanese game developer Goichi Suda (aka SUDA 51) is a fan of Jackass: The Movie. The main character of the 2007 No More Heroes video game, Travis Touchdown, was inspired by Johnny Knoxville.

The pound (symbol: £) was the currency of North Carolina until 1793. Initially, sterling coin circulated, supplemented from 1709 by the introduction of colonial currency denominated in pounds, shillings and pence in 1712. The North Carolina currency was worth less than sterling, with a rating of 1 North Carolina shilling = 9 pence sterling (or 1 North Carolina pound to 15 shillings sterling). The first issue of paper money was known as "Old Tenor" money. In 1748, "New Tenor" paper money was introduced, worth times the Old Tenor notes.
The State of North Carolina issued continental currency denominated in £sd and Spanish dollars at the York rating of 1 dollar = 8 shillings. The continental currency was replaced by the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1000 continental dollars = 1 U.S. dollar.

Sofema (Société française d'exportation de matériel militaire et aéronautique) is a French company which specializes today in the renovation, marketing and maintenance of first generation land, sea and air equipment, mainly from material sourced from the French Armed Forces.
The company is headquartered in Levallois, near Paris.
Technical facilities are situated in La Teste (Gironde - in the south west of France) and Châteauroux (Indre). Sofema was used by Indian lobbyist Niira Radia and Singh for routing their money which they earned as commission in the deal with Sahara Airlines to negotiate the purchase of helicopters from Eurocopter.
History
Sofema was created in 1997 from the merger of two utility companies (Ofema and Sofma), responsible for supporting and guiding the foreign sales of large French aeronautic and defence groups.
Its first President (until 2001) was the Préfet Ivan Barbot (former president of Ofema) who oversaw the privatization of the company in 1998 around a core group of important shareholders including EADS, Safran (born from the merger of Snecma and Sagem), DCNS, Thales, NEXTER SYSTEMS (formerly GIAT), Dassault Aviation (represent by Eric Trappier), Renault Trucks (Volvo Group).
Appointed CEO and Chairman in 2001, General (CR) Bernard Norlain embarked on a policy of diversification in response to a gradual erosion of its core business – due, particularly, to the establishment of sales teams within its holding.
In 2007, under the leadership of its new chairperson and CEO, Guillaume Giscard d'Estaing, Sofema underwent a profound shift in its business.
In effect, the company passed in just a few years from playing a role as intermediary in large French export contracts, to selling renovated land, air and sea equipment. Products include the VBC-90 internal security vehicle, Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé APC, and Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopter, in addition to the AML and Eland series of light armoured cars.
Sofema operations
Renovation
Depending on the needs of its customers, Sofema acquires first generation equipment, mainly of French origin, and overhauls this to a pristine state in its workshops, or through its specialized partners.
Contracts include significant support to implementation and training to buyer-countries, equal to the services provided by major industry in exports of new equipment.
Trading
Complementary to its renovation activities, Sofema offers spare parts.
Advisory
Sofema's International Advisory department aims to assist industry groups around the world in their international development. It offers combined audit financing, commercial representation, services across five continents in the areas of defence and security, aerospace, energy, transport infrastructure and the environment.

Charlie Cunningham (born August 23, 1948) is a mountain biker from Fairfax, California.
Along with frame builder Steve Potts and their helper Mark Slate, Cunningham co-founded Wilderness Trail Bikes (WTB). Cunningham and Potts were forced out of WTB in 2002 for undisclosed reasons, at the urging of WTB's CEO, Patrick Seidler. Cunningham and their wife, Jacquie Phelan, are charter inductees to Crested Butte's Mountain Bike Hall of Fame.
Early life
Cunningham came from an air force family and lived in Alabama, Virginia, Japan, and San Diego during their childhood, ultimately settling in Mill Valley on Mount Tamalpais, Marin County. Their father, Bruce Cunningham, was a World War II and Korean War fighter pilot who won the Thompson Trophy in 1949, the only year military jets (F-86) competed. Their mother, Carol, was a book artist whose imprint Sunflower Press is found in several museum collections. In their twenties, Cunningham studied nutrition, water quality, and chemistry, as well as engineering. At 25, they became interested in bicycles.
Inventions
In the early 1980s, Cunningham invented a number of features for use on modern mountain bikes:
tubular-style fork crowns
135 mm lower-dish rear wheel for mountain bikes, which are now the standard
identifying the fundamental tread design principles needed for well-performing mountain bike tires. Cunningham co-designed Ground Control, a tire incorporating these principles.
the Grease Guard Bearing System that allows bicyclists to replace the dirty grease that gets into bicycle bearings with clean grease in seconds, thus extending component life and saving time and money spent fixing and/or replacing parts.
the Roller Cam Brake. The brake arms, the pivot mounting location, and the linkage combined to eliminate flex in the fork blades and frame stays. This brake also featured the linear spring they invented, now used on almost all V-Brakes. The cam was eventually replaced with the Lever Link.
Competitive career
Cunningham raced competitively in 1984, placing tenth overall at the NORBA championships in Nederland, Colorado. They became National Vet Champion at the age of 36.
Cunningham built a total of 187 aluminum bicycles (the Indian, the Racer, and the Wombat for smaller people) between 1979 and 1992. They were guaranteed for life and cost about six times as much as custom (steel) bikes.  They are now a freelance inventor working on environmentally sustainable projects.

Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, or simply Blues Incorporated, were an English blues band formed in London in 1961, led by Alexis Korner and including at various times Jack Bruce, Charlie Watts, Terry Cox, Davy Graham, Ginger Baker, Art Wood, Long John Baldry, Ronnie Jones, Danny Thompson, Graham Bond, Cyril Davies, Malcolm Cecil, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Mick Jagger.
History
Korner (1928–1984) was a member of Chris Barber's Jazz Band in the 1950s, and met up with Cyril Davies (1932–1964) who shared their passion for American blues. In 1954 they teamed up as a duo, began playing blues in London jazz clubs, and opened their own club, the London Blues and Barrelhouse Club, where they featured visiting bluesmen from America. The club embraced aspiring young musicians, including in its early days Charlie Watts, Long John Baldry, and Jack Bruce.
In 1961 Korner and Davies formed Blues Incorporated, the first amplified R&B band in Britain, and brought in singer Baldry (sometimes replaced by Art Wood), drummer Watts, bassist Bruce, and saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith. It was an informal band: its membership was intended to be fluid.
On 17 March 1962, Korner and Davies established a regular "Rhythm and Blues Night" at the Ealing Jazz Club. This brought together many more fans of blues and R&B music including Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Paul Jones, John Mayall, Zoot Money, and Jimmy Page, some of whom would occasionally sit in on Blues Incorporated performances. Watts left the group around this time to join the Rolling Stones and suggested Ginger Baker as their replacement.
From 3 May 1962, Blues Incorporated secured a Thursday-night residency at the Marquee Club, which brought them to the attention of record producer and promoter Jack Good who arranged a recording contract with Decca Records resulting in the LP R&B from the Marquee, released in late 1962.
The album was actually recorded in the Decca studio and featured Baldry as lead singer with songs by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Witherspoon and Leroy Carr.
Late in 1962 Davies disagreed with Korner's intention to add a brass section to the band and turn more towards jazz than blues, so left to form their own group, the Cyril Davies All-Stars, and was replaced by Graham Bond. Blues Incorporated found a new residency at the Flamingo club but, shortly afterwards, Bond, Bruce and Baker left to form the Graham Bond Organisation.
Blues Incorporated concentrated on live work rather than recording and the group only released two singles on Parlophone, "I Need Your Loving" / "Please Please" (1964) and "Little Baby" / "Roberta" (1965). In 1964 they released the LPs At The Cavern and Red Hot From Alex, with American Herbie Goins as lead singer and Danny Thompson, later of Pentangle, on bass. By the time of the group's last album Sky High (credited to Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated) in 1965, the group included Duffy Power on vocals. Korner dissolved the group in 1966.
