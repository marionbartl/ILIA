Bedar Bakht was one of the last people to leave the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce Sunday night after a prayer service and meal with dozens of congregants.
"So we were here until 11:30 p.m. almost give or take a few minutes," he said.
The timestamp from the center's newly installed video cameras show not long after, an arsonist struck. " The guy just don't know what he's did. What can I say? They don't know what they're doing. It's a stupid move on his part."
Bakht said he and others cried after learning of the devastation, something they did not expect.
"I was relaxed to be honest. Someone told me, 'It's September 11th, be careful.' I said, ‘no man it's been 15 years.' The Orlando incident had passed us by two and a half months. That was a dangerous time when we were in there during Ramadan. It's all over. I'm relaxed. Not afraid. Then this happened, it blows me away," said Bakht.
Tuesday afternoon investigators say they have only received eight tips.
“That is very disheartening, because regardless of individuals' belief this is a place of worship and a tragic situation. And the individuals responsible for this need to be brought to justice,” said St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office Major David Thompson.
Bakht says it may be another day or two before they're allowed to see what, if anything can be salvaged inside.
"But I know we will be able to build it… better and beautiful and all faiths can come and pray with us and we will stand united," Bahkt said.
There are now rewards totaling $10,000.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations is offering $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible. CAIR's Florida chapter is also offering a $4,000 reward.
And the Florida Advisory Committee on Arson Prevention has posted a $5,000 reward.
Tips can be called to the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office at 772.462.3230 or Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers at 800.273.TIPS.
Earlier this month, human rights experts from the United Nations visited a backwards country where women are paid significantly less than men, where women are drastically underrepresented in the national legislature, where the percentages of women living in poverty and dying during childbirth are rising, where pregnant women in prisons are shackled during childbirth, and where women face intimidation and harassment while trying to access health care.
When they returned from their trip, they said they were “shocked” by what they found and chided the nation for being one of just seven—including Iran, Somalia, and Sudan—that hasn't yet ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).
You'll be forgiven if you haven't heard of this place before. It's an obscure nation called the United States of America.
On December 11th, a UN working group on legal discrimination against women concluded its ten-day tour of the United States, which included meetings in Washington D.C. and visits to Alabama, Oregon and Texas. Between them, the experts in the working group, led by Eleonora Zielinska of Poland, have decades of experience in law, public policy, diplomacy, academia, and government.
What they found, essentially, was that the U.S. hypocritically fails to measure up to the very standards that it sets for other countries when it comes to women's human rights. “The United States, which is a leading state in formulating international human rights standards, is allowing its women to lag behind international human rights standards,” the group concluded in a statement, released to the press in advance of a full report coming in June 2016.
Their statement is an eye-opening description of the country from an outsider's perspective that may recall that time you read “Body Ritual Among the Nacirema” in grade school: When the U.S. is de-centered, it seems woefully unadvanced relative to its wealth.
“We acknowledge the United States' commitment to liberty, so well represented by the Statue of Liberty which symbolizes both womanhood and freedom,” the statement began. The praise mostly stopped there.
Despite currently having “the highest level of legislative representation ever achieved by women” in the country, the U.S. still ranks at a mere 72 in the world in terms of the percentage of female lawmakers. With women holding just 19.4 percent of congressional seats, the U.S. falls well below Rwanda, Mexico, Uganda, Pakistan, and most developed nations.
The group also concluded that women play an essential role in driving the growth of the U.S. economy but suffer disproportionately from the global recession's aftereffects and from persistent income inequality, with a wage gap of 21 percent. On top of these overarching disparities, non-white women, pregnant women, and new mothers face even more challenges in employment.
“[W]e are shocked by the lack of mandatory standards for workplace accommodation for pregnant women, post-natal mothers and persons with care responsibilities, which are required in international human rights law,” the experts noted.
Indeed, the U.S. consistently falls at or near the bottom of international parental leave rankings because it requires no paid leave, only 12 weeks of unpaid time off.
The working group was also discouraged by the fact that the percentage of women living in poverty had increased over the last decade from 12.1 to 14.5 percent, and that the maternal mortality rate increased by 136 percent from 1990 to 2013. Both of these figures vary by ethnicity: non-white women earn less than white women and African-American women die during childbirth at three to four times the rate of white women. The statement listed off even more human rights violations and shortcomings in the United States: contraception exemptions in insurance plans courtesy of the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision, the criminalization of women in prostitution, a lack of “adequate and quality sex education” with an inordinate focus on abstinence, and widespread discrimination against immigrant women.
“While all women are the victims of these missing rights, women who are poor, belong to Native American, Afro-American and Hispanic ethnic minorities, migrant women, LBTQ women, women with disabilities and older women are disparately vulnerable,” they concluded.
But the experts were especially concerned by the current state of reproductive rights in the United States. They visited abortion clinics in Texas and Alabama and witnessed firsthand that “many of the clinics work in conditions of constant threats, harassments and vandalizing.”
“Although women have a legal right to terminate a pregnancy under federal law, ever increasing barriers are being created to prevent their access to abortion procedures,” they observed.
The late November shooting of a police officer and two civilians at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood center took place “just before the start of [their] visit,” they said, and “once again demonstrated the extreme hostility and danger faced by family planning providers and patients.”
“We urge the authorities to combat the stigma attached to reproductive and sexual health care, which leads to violence, harassment and intimidation against those seeking or providing reproductive health care, and to investigate and prosecute violence or threats of violence,” they advised.
Above all, the working group urges the U.S. to finally ratify CEDAW. As Amnesty International notes, the U.S. currently has “the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Western Hemisphere and the only industrialized democracy that has not yet ratified this treaty,” first adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979.
Ratifying CEDAW would require the U.S. to commit “to incorporate the principle of equality of men and women in their legal system.” The U.S. Senate has never voted on the treaty.
“We understand the complexity of federalism,” the working group noted, “but this cannot be regarded as a justification for failure to secure these rights.”
Heavy rain cuts off far north SA towns; stranded musicians liven up Marree
Updated
Road access to towns in South Australia's far north has been cut by recent heavy rain, leaving many tourists - among them several groups of musicians - stranded
The Oodnadatta and Birdsville tracks, and part of the Strzelecki Track have been closed, leaving many communities in the area inaccessible by road.
Rain began falling heavily on Friday, closing all roads to William Creek, and over the weekend the roads into Arkaroola and Marree were also closed.
Phil Turner from the Marree Hotel said although the rain had stopped, roads still needed to dry out.
He said those stranded included groups of musicians who had been finding ways to keep themselves, and everyone else, entertained.
"We've got three campers here, three separate lots, and they're all musicians," he said.
"They've teamed up each night and pulled out everything from cellos and violins, to guitars and drums, and we've had a couple of jam sessions, so that's been lovely in the evening.
"During the day there are plenty of walks around town they're doing."
Mr Turner said many stranded tourists had also been taking flights to see water in Lake Eyre, continuing what had been a strong tourism season.
"The Australian dollar has had an effect on that; there's a general stability in government without elections, both state and federal that we've had in the last two years," he said.
"But I think there's just a sort of levelling off of confidence which has seen more people holidaying and taking advantage in everything the far north of South Australia has to offer."
On Friday, local resident Talia Sheppard said international visitors were not upset about the rain.
"It's beautiful for the countryside for them to see water lying around; it's when the outback sort of flourishes," she said.
"They're pretty lucky to see it like that, and most of the international tourists see it that way as well."

Travis Nichols just got in touch with The Lede and confirmed that, yes, he was joking when he called Arizona Iced Tea “the drink of fascists” on Twitter on Tuesday. He added that he was traveling for work yesterday and had no idea, until checking his e-mail at the end of the day, that his comment — which was inspired, he said, by the Twitter-based comic musings of @conanobrien and @colsonwhitehead — was being taken seriously by critics of Arizona boycotts and the media.
While saying that he did not think that suggesting a boycott of Arizona Iced Tea was his best joke — “As a joke I would give it a C minus” — Mr. Nichols expressed shock that his comment could spread so far so fast before anyone got in touch with him to confirm that he was not kidding, or even looked closely at his other comments on Twitter. It seemed to him, he said, that people writing on the Web sites of Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh simply wanted evidence to support their theory that liberals are idiots and the idea that there was a misguided campaign to boycott Iced Tea was, as they used to say in the news business, too good to check.
After this post was published, more evidence emerged to suggest that @travisjnichols was perhaps not entirely serious about crippling Arizona's economy by leading a Twitter-driven boycott of AriZona Iced Tea. Mr. Nichols added these updates to his Twitter feed late on Wednesday:
The party game of fascists? The limbo. #thedrinkoffascists The movie of fascists? Rush Hour 3. #thedrinkoffascists. The drug of fascists? Oxycontin! #thedrinkoffascists.
He also changed his biography on the social-networking site to read simply: “I am totally serious. And American.”
On Tuesday afternoon, amid calls to boycott Arizona — in response to its new law authorizing police officers to ask people suspected of being illegal immigrants to produce their documents — a writer named Travis Nichols posted this thought on Twitter:
I think we should all also boycott Arizona Iced Tea because it is the drink of fascists.
Although it seems quite possible that Mr. Nichols was joking — he has written for “The Believer,” a part of the McSweeney's empire essentially founded on puckish humor — barely 12 hours after he posted his real or comic call to arms, his comment was used to suggest that a drink-based protest movement was sweeping the nation in an article in New York's Daily News.
A call to Mr. Nichols at the the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where he works, has not yet been returned, but here is an example of a previous update on his Twitter feed:
Though lizards don't have lips, the stewardess had what can only be described as lizard lips. Explain that one, Darwin!
While the campaign to boycott the drink might never have existed, it was widely ridiculed on Wednesday anyway, after Helen Kennedy of The Daily News reported that Arizona Iced Tea is made by a company based on Long Island that has no actual connection to the state of Arizona.
Apparently fearing that ill-informed Americans might boycott their drinks anyway, Don Vultaggio, the founder and chairman of Arizona Beverages, posted a note on the company's Web site on Wednesday, headlined, “Arizona's From New York,” accompanied by an illustration stressing the company's patriotism.
The note, on a section of the drink maker's site called “Recent Concerns” stresses that even though customers might have a “reasonable suspicion” that the tea is an Arizona native, it actually has a New York birth certificate.
Here is Mr. Vultaggio's attempt to put some distance between what he calls “AriZona” and Arizona:
There are a lot of things that work in comics, and a lot that don't. Some of these storytelling aspects were ideas that once were greaoundbreaking and great, but like much of the worlds greatness have simply become cliches. It takes talent to know the difference and Wally Wood knew the difference.
Wood's 22 Panels That Always Work is a classic look at what does work in comics storytelling that has always fascinated me because it still holds up today. Wood wanted to be “as efficient as possible” in his work, so he developed these panels as shortcuts in his visual storytelling. He hung them aound his studio as reference and they have made their way into countless other comics artist's workspaces since. In 2006, DJ Coffman even beat me to it and had all 22 tattooed on his arm as a sleeve.
I wonder if he'll add today's page to the other arm?
Regardless, as you may have noticed at the top of the page, today we have a very special guest writer. While Sohmer takes a few days to continue hollowing out the potential “Sohmer-Cave” under his house, the man behind Thrillbent digital comics, Mark Waid has stepped in for today's page!
Mark Waid has written a wider variety of well-known characters than any other American comics author, from Superman to the Justice League to Spider-Man to Archie and hundreds of others. His award-winning graphic novel with artist Alex Ross, KINGDOM COME, is one of the best-selling comics of all time. With over twenty-five years of experience in his field, Waid maintains an active blog that is crammed full of advice for beginning writers and experienced authors both. Waid and TV scribe John Rogers launched Thrillbent in 2012, an imprint dedicated to exploring the potential of the digital comics medium.
And that's not all! We dug up a friend of Mark's, the very talented artist, Jeremy Rock:
A talented young artist with a clean yet expressive line and an exceptional eye for a variety of subject matter from tech to fantasy and everything in between, Jeremy Rock made his professional debut at Avatar where he worked on such titles as NARCOPOLIS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THRESHOLD. He then worked for BOOM! Studios, where he drew short stories for ZOMBIE TALES, and illustrated COLD SPACE. Currently, Jeremy is illustrating the graphic novel Days Missing Enox for Roddenberry. He is also a creator at Thrillbent.
Hopefully they will both be back in the future with more Panels That Don't Work. Having 22 “Don't work” panels side-by-side with the “works” panels would be fantastic!
Until then, have a great day browsing the stacks, my friends! We return here Friday!

Historians looking back on the Bush presidency may well wonder if Congress actually existed.
Time and time again, President Bush has run circles around what is, at least on paper, a co-equal branch of government. Sometimes he doesn't bother to ask Congress for its approval. Sometimes he demands it -- and gets it.
Amazingly enough, that didn't change when the Democrats won control of the House and Senate. They just make a bit more fuss before rolling over.
Charles Babington writes for the Associated Press: "Congressional Democrats prepared Wednesday for major concessions on Iraq war funding, children's health insurance, tax policies, general spending and energy, because they could not overcome vetoes by President Bush.
"The setbacks are a stinging disappointment for Democrats, who took control of the House and Senate with narrow majorities this year but never found a formula for coaxing compromises from Bush and his GOP supporters. Republicans blame Democratic hubris, but both sides agree on one thing: Voters will have a clear choice in 2008 on how Congress should be run. . . .
"House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters that Democrats have done all they can. 'We were not elected to do what the president tells us to do,' Hoyer said. But acknowledging political realities, he added: 'If he vetoes and we can't override the veto, then we have to go in some other direction.'
"In every case, Bush's veto powers or senators' filibuster powers have forced Democrats to retreat. . . .
"The bitterest pill for House Democrats is their continued inability to force U.S. troop withdrawals in exchange for continued funding of the Iraq war. Final details were undecided Wednesday, but top Democrats said the administration will get a significant portion of its war spending request, with no strings attached."
Jonathan Weisman writes in The Washington Post: "House Democratic leaders yesterday agreed to meet President Bush's bottom-line spending limit on a sprawling, half-trillion-dollar domestic spending bill, dropping their demands for as much as $22 billion in additional spending but vowing to shift funds from the president's priorities to theirs. . . .
"The agreement signaled that congressional Democrats are ready to give in to many of the White House's demands as they try to finish the session before they break for Christmas -- a political victory for the president, who has refused to compromise on the spending measures. . . .
"White House spokesman Tony Fratto emphasized last night, 'The White House is not part of any deal, full stop.'"
Alexander Bolton writes in The Hill: "The Democrats' capitulation Wednesday on the total domestic spending level is the latest instance of Bush prevailing on a major policy showdown."
In Mexico City, late teen friends Tenoch Iturbide and Julio Zapata are feeling restless as their respective girlfriends are traveling together through Europe before they all begin the next phase of their lives at college. At a lavish family wedding, Tenoch and Julio meet Luisa Cortés, the twenty-something wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, the two who have just moved to Mexico from Spain. Tenoch and Julio try to impress the beautiful Luisa by telling her that they will be taking a trip to the most beautiful secluded beach in Mexico called la Boca del Cielo (translated to Heaven's Mouth), the trip and the beach which in reality don't exist. When Luisa learns of Jano's latest marital indiscretion straight from the horse's mouth, she takes Tenoch and Julio's offer to go along on this road trip, meaning that Tenoch and Julio have to pull together quickly a road trip to a non-existent beach. They decide to head toward one suggested by their friend Saba, who seems a little confused himself of ... Written by Huggo
So this is probably one of my favourite recipes - mainly because it's ready in about 3 minutes, so it's a really quick fix when you have a sweet craving.
I was inspired to make this by the Cookie Dough dessert you get at Pizza Hut - the warm half baked cookie dough with a dollop of ice cream in the middle - an indulgent pudding for two, that I used to always devour by myself.
And, with this recipe, you can now do the same without putting on any weight!
All it takes is:
2 tablespoons of butter
4 tablespoons of splenda
a few drops of vanilla extract
chopped up sugar-free chocolate - I use Cavalier Dark Chocolate (it has a much nicer taste than the Balance brand)
2 tablespoons Carbalose flour
5 tablespoons ground almonds
The Splenda, Cavalier chocolate, Carbalose flour and ground almonds can all be bought here
You can, if you want, use just ground almonds and omit the Carbalose flour. You may also need to add more/less flour so that it is not too sticky.
Then you just mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, bung it in the microwave till the chocolate melts and goes all gooey, and then eat it straight away with a dollop of cream or sugar-free ice cream!
You can also just eat the dough raw, or roll it into little balls to make Cookie Dough Ice Cream (just like Ben & Jerry's)
Tastes so naughty...
But it's not.
The Waldpolenz Solar Park is built on a surface area equivalent to 200 soccer fields, the solar park will be capable of feeding 40 megawatts into the power grid when fully operational in 2009.
In the start-up phase, the 130-million-euro ($201 million) plant it will have a capacity of 24 megawatts, according to the Juwi group, which operates the installation.
The facility, located east of Leipzig, uses state-of-the-art, thin-film technology. Some 550,000 thin-film modules will be used, of which 350,000 have already been installed. The direct current produced in the photovoltaic solar modules will be converted into alternating current and fed completely into the power grid.
After just a year the solar power station will have produced the energy needed to build it, according to the Juwi group.
The eastern part of Germany is one of the forerunners of solar energy in the country. Three of the world's 50 biggest solar parks are located near Leipzig.
A solar plant due to be completed in California by 2011 will have a capacity of 80 megawatts - double that of Waldpolenz.
A TRANSGENDER football photographer is launching a campaign to become a Labour Party candidate in the general election.
AFC Bournemouth photographer Sophie Cook, who came out after the club's promotion to the Premier League in 2015, hopes to stand as MP in Brighton where she lives.
The 50-year-old said she would campaign to ensure people could ‘live free from fear where no one suffers from prejudice' if she is elected.
Sophie, who is also a TV presenter, said: “In 2016 I was approached to stand for local political office but was barred from this opportunity unless I gave up the TV work and so, reluctantly, I had to decline.
“And then Theresa May called a snap general election, the plans that I'd had to potentially stand in 2020 were thrown in overdrive and I declared an interest in becoming a candidate.
“The reception to me, as a trans woman, has been positive with many declaring that it's time for greater diversity in parliament.
“The time is right, the time is now and we must all work together to achieve a more caring, more diverse society where everyone can live free from fear and where no one suffers from prejudice regardless of their gender, sexuality, gender identity, race, religion, disability or wealth.”
As previously reported in the Daily Echo, Sophie, an ex-RAF engineer and motorbike racer, spoke of her pride of being ‘totally accepted' by Cherries players and fans after decades of feeling trapped in the wrong body.
Sophie, who has battled depression, explained her reasons for standing as candidate.
She said: “The mental anguish of my gender dysphoria coupled with the post traumatic stress led to depression, and then self harming and suicide attempts.
“As I became more aware of what my trans identity meant I realised that any political ambitions that I might have had been out of the question, with politicians being outed for their sexuality what chance did a bisexual transgender person have.
“Even when I came out in 2015 I was still terrified that by being true to myself that I would lose everything, my career in football, my family and most of all, my children.
“By being true to myself I've lost a lot, my entire family turned their backs on me at the very moment that I needed them most, but my children have been amazing and I regularly see my two youngest kids.
“When I came out I faced a choice, to either hide or to stand up and try to make a difference.”
Mario Kart 8 is poised for the winner's circle on the Wii U Nintendo Prepare to be unified! Nintendo is putting their gonads back in place and rearranging their feet to position themselves to dropkick the competition and springboard their leg to low-blow any and everything else that drops this spring. Why? Because they can. How? With Mario Kart 8. It's been confirmed by Nintendo that Mario Kart 8 is legitimately confirmed to launch this May, exclusively for the Wii U, as reported by Games Radar. Nintendo dropped bombs in their new investor seminar that rolled out a roadmap of changes the company will be exploring through 2014 and 2015. The company isn't changing too much, but they had to say something in order to shut up all the naysayers and doom-spinners. Heck, there was so much negative spin that Fox's executives muttered under their own breath "We don't even dog Obama this badly." Heck, Bill O'Reilly gives pot smokers an easier time than the media has given Nintendo, and he would probably rather sacrifice his testicles to Baal before giving in to smoke the toke. Nintendo also revealed that they would be rolling out unified network accounts for users, enabling users to take their digital progress and virtual console games with them, no matter what system they game on. Nintendo has also made it known that a price-cut for the Wii U is not inbound. They will not be moving away from the $299 price point any time soon, as noted on GameSpot. They also want to focus more on the GamePad support, almost identical to people saying Microsoft either needs to buck up and make Kinect important in Xbox One games or axe it from the system's retail box so they can cut the price down. Nintendo, however, will follow through with their own gimmick: the GamePad isn't just there for farts and giggles. The device will supposedly play a much larger role in their first, second and some third-party titles, most notably kicking things into high gear with Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, as well as with Project CARS from Slightly Mad Studios. Nintendo's goal is to get Mario Kart 8 out there by the end of spring to boost some good sales through the E3 marketing blitz, and then from there - hopefully, maybe - roll out a strong line-up of additional exclusives either on stage or during a Nintendo Direct. With Mario Kart Wii, the Big 'N' managed to move a breezy 34 million copies. It wouldn't be surprising if Mario Kart 8 was the catalyst for continued momentum of Wii U sales when May rolls around. The company still needs to address software leading up to that date with offerings in February, March and April. Hopefully they'll have some good outings to keep up their holiday sales trend that helped keep them as the number one leader in the eighth generation of gaming.
Weeds that resemble knee-high grass grow in planter pots in a small room at a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab just outside Washington, D.C. Light, heat, and carbon dioxide reach the plants at steady levels. For more than a month, the weeds have sustained the same conditions expected to be earth's norm 35 years from now — carbon dioxide levels equivalent to an urban traffic jam, and temperatures tipping into the dangerous zone for the planet's health.
But rather than choking from such treatment, the weeds — a wild plant called red rice — are thriving. The test lab mimics conditions expected around the world by 2050, when an additional 2.6 billion people will be wondering what's for dinner.
Red rice (right) produces more seed than cultivated rice (left), but it is very difficult to harvest because the seeds shatter. N. BURGOS, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS
Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studies, among other things, weeds in food production and human health. Weeds beguile Ziska. Weeds may be the largest single limitation to global crop yield. But they also have traits that are useful to plant growth. Red rice, for instance, can adapt to more carbon dioxide and heat by producing more stems and grain — red rice has 80 to 90 percent more seed than cultivated rice.
Now, plant breeders and plant physiologists are capitalizing on those traits and counting on all possible sources of genetic variation, including weedy lines of rice, to improve productivity in cultivated crop varieties. Such cross-breeding could play an important role in helping the world's staple food crops better adapt to a warming climate.
‘A weed is a plant whose virtues have yet to be discovered,' says one scientist.
Plant physiologists such as Ziska usually put weeds in two categories: “an unwanted or undesired plant species” and “early vegetation following soil disturbance.” Ziska thinks a third definition could be more suitable: the unloved flower. “A weed is a plant whose virtues have yet to be discovered,” he says, paraphrasing Emerson.
Ziska is not the only one with this perspective. Many scientists now believe that weeds may be part of the solution to boosting harvests in a warming world. Wild lines of wheat, oats, and rice — which are, in fact, weeds — have genetic characteristics that may be useful to adapt their domesticated cousins to an uncertain future.
Why weeds? When other plants are wilting at extremes of temperature and rainfall, weeds thrive. Ziska studies weeds for their redemptive qualities. His research in this area was bolstered on a sweltering day in an abandoned industrial lot in Baltimore, 25 miles from his USDA research center, where he observed weeds that were two to four times bigger than weeds growing on his rural test plot. The urban weeds prompted further research on weeds that could be valuable to raising crops in high-carbon, high-heat scenarios.
Ziska tries not to call red rice a weed. Sometimes he calls it skanky rice, but mostly he refers to it as wild or feral rice. All crop plants were wild at some point. They became domesticated in the same way cows and pigs became domesticated on farms: through breeding and selection. Wild and feral crop relatives are the original source of raw genetic material from which all modern crop varieties were first developed, but these reservoirs of natural variation have not been well studied.
Breeding from wild, ancestral plant populations may hold the key to creating crops of the future. Wheat breeding has already made significant progress in producing weedy lines, which have led to the cultivation of edible wheat. Because it has a large genome, wheat can incorporate traits that better withstand heat and drought. Matthew Reynolds, head of the wheat physiology program at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico City, says that wheat producers are fortunate because they are slightly ahead of the curve in developing heat- and drought-resistant varieties.
The breeding system allows ancient traits and genes to be constantly recycled and recombined.
The value of using wild relatives of crops as sources of environmental resilience and resistance to pests and diseases led to an estimated $115 billion in annual benefits to the world economy by 1997, primarily through increased production, according to research at Cornell University.
Although seeds are readily accessible in 1,700 gene banks throughout the world, “they are not used to their full potential in plant breeding,” said Susan McCouch, a plant geneticist at Cornell. “There are still vast reserves of valuable genes and traits hidden in low-performing wild ancestors and long forgotten early farmer varieties that can be coaxed out of these ancient plants by crossing them with higher-yielding modern relatives. These crosses give rise to families of offspring that carry a myriad of new possibilities for the future.”
McCouch says the plant breeder's job is to utilize a combination of insight, field experience, technology, and innovative breeding strategies to select the most promising offspring and prepare them for release as new varieties. The breeding system allows ancient traits and genes to be constantly recycled and recombined, giving rise to an infinite range of new possibilities with every generation.
“The same process happens in nature,” she said, “but the plant breeder can bring together parents from diverse sources that would never have found each other in the wild.”
Improved rice breeding has a long way to go. It takes about 10 years for a crop to go from breeding to production, and another five years to bring it to distribution to farmers. That's because it is a painstakingly slow process to select populations of offspring that contain combinations of traits and genes that have never been utilized in agriculture before, then test their resiliency to environmental stresses.
But through such work weeds may become the unlikely hero of food production. Take red rice. As the name implies, weedy red rice looks like cultivated rice — the staple food for more than 3 billion people in the world — but it is an Asian wild grass. If it gets into a field of cultivated rice, it's a fierce competitor. Because it looks so similar to rice, it develops incognito. It grows vigorously. It propagates quickly. As it matures, it grows taller than other rice plants.
The demand for rice and other cereals is expected to rise by 14 percent per decade.
Then the wind blows its seeds all over a field and the crop plants itself. Red rice can't be controlled by herbicides because it is so closely related to most cultivated rice. Once it's established in a field, it is so aggressive that it will cut a field's rice yield by 80 percent. Within five years it can become the dominant species in a field. Technically, red rice is edible but almost impossible to harvest because once it develops a seed, the seed falls to the ground and shatters.
The goal, says Ziska, is to transfer the traits that make red rice so hardy into the more commonly cultivated rice crops.
With a growing global population projected to reach 9.6 billion by mid-century, the demand for rice and other cereals is expected to rise by 14 percent per decade. But climate change is expected to cut into some of those crop yields. Today's high temperatures stress the rice plants, limit growth, and shorten growing seasons. Increasing carbon dioxide causes weeds to outpace crop growth. Coastal deltas are major rice-growing areas worldwide, and repeated coastal flooding is worsening with rising sea levels and intensifying storms; Vietnam, one of the top exporters of rice globally, already is losing land in the Mekong Delta.
To surmount these many challenges, new tools and technologies are being developed that allow plant breeders to utilize ever-more distantly related wild and exotic relatives and to liberate the potential that remains locked up in these reservoirs of natural variation.
However, crop resilience does not come in the form of a silver bullet. “It will not be one new trait, one super crop variety or one new management system that allows us to meet the world's demand for food,” McCouch says. “It takes time, effort and training to make significant genetic progress when utilizing these ancient sources of variation.”
But Donald Boesch, president of the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science said agricultural science must move quickly to keep pace with climate change. “This adaptation needs to be fast,” said Boesch. “It is not something we can gradually work on. We need to have our science to support adaptation done at the same time as the rapid change that is occurring. And that poses tremendous risks for food security.”
Ziska believes weeds will likely be a key part of the solution. “The feral cousins of today's crops may allow us to adapt to meet food security needs,” he says. “This paradox of weeds I find fascinating. Let's turn lemons into lemonade.”
Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia released the first picture of themselves and their newborn son on Wednesday afternoon. A statement published on the Royal Court's website said they had left the hospital and were currently enjoying their new life as a family at Drottningholm castle west of Stockholm.
The picture was taken in similar style, although in arguably better quality, as the first picture of Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel's second child, Prince Oscar, also snapped at the hospital.

Gun shots rang out across Sweden at noon on Wednesday, in honour of the new prince. In Stockholm the 21-gun salute was fired from the Skeppsholmen island.
His grandmother Queen Silvia is in New York this week, but earlier in the day his grandfather King Carl XVI Gustaf paid a visit to Danderyd Hospital to say hello to the new prince.
"What's important is that Princess Sofia and Prince Carl Philip are well. This little child too. Looked very nice and cute," the King was quoted by the Expressen tabloid as saying while leaving the hospital.
The baby's name, which Carl Philip said yesterday has already been decided, will be revealed on Thursday. And the King refused to let slip the secret.
"Take it easy! That's what it's all about. There should be a little hocus-pocus to it all and some excitement," he laughed.

"For my wife and me, this is a great day full of emotion," Carl Philip told a press conference following the birth of the couple's first child late on Tuesday.
The baby weighed in at 3.6 kilograms (8 pounds) and measured 49 centimetres (19.3 inches), the prince added.
The palace said in an earlier statement that both Princess Sofia, 31, and her new son were in good health.

Carl Philip married Sofia Hellqvist, a former contestant on TV reality show 'Paradise Hotel', in a ceremony in June last year.
She famously posed topless with a boa constrictor in a men's magazine when she was 20.
She later studied accountancy in New York and became a yoga teacher, while also working as a waitress before returning to Sweden.

Sofia has since headed an NGO for disadvantaged children in South Africa which she founded in 2010 after earlier African charity work, but gave up the role after her marriage to focus on royal duties.
The new baby prince already has plenty of royal cousins to play with. Prince Oscar, the second child of Princess Victoria, was born just seven weeks ago. He is the younger brother of four-year-old Princess Estelle. London-based Princess Madeleine also has two children, Princess Leonore and Prince Nicolas.
Ahead of the announcement of his name on Thursday, there has already been plenty of online speculation that 'Dalarna', the region of Sweden where Princess Sofia comes from could be included in his title.
Meanwhile congratulations immediately began pouring in from around the world, with the hashtag #CarlPhilip still trending in Sweden at 8am. Below is a selection of some of the well wishes.

Ask anyone knowledgeable about the crypto market what's the shadiest digital currency out there right now and without hesitation it's likely they'll tell you it's (XMR).
Sometimes referred to as "the drug dealer's cryptocurrency of choice" because of its sharp focus on privacy, Monero was founded in 2014. Its website describes it as “secure, private, and untraceable," as well as "accessible to all." The technology behind Monero is the CryptoNote protocol, an evolution off the ideas that form the basis of . However, unlike Bitcoin's transparent blockchain which allows anyone to follow the chain back in order to determine who sent and/or received coins, transactions via CryptoNote cannot be traced, and senders as well as receivers of coins remain anonymous.
As of this writing, XMR has a market cap of $6.28 billion. It's currently trading at $391.11. In the past year, it's , gaining more than 3000%.
XMRUSD Daily
There have been recent reports of computers being hacked and hijacked, for use in unauthorized mining of Monero. One Buenos Aires-based Starbucks' Wi-Fi provider was found to have forced a 10 second delay when users first attempted to connect to the service, during which time the service surreptitiously used their laptops to mine the digital currency. Russian oil pipeline giant Transneft's computers for the same purpose, via malware.
Researchers Maxim Zavodchik and Liron Segal described to SC Magazine how a hack attack might work. When a hacker is able to access a Windows-based system they will use PowerShell to download and install a malicious software program that mines Monero. In Linux the attackers may use Python scripts taken from EmpireProject, after which they also install the Monero miner.
Monero isn't only the coin of choice for shady characters, however. Monero's developers have announced that 45 musicians including Mariah Carey, Sia, G-Eazy, Weezer, Dolly Parton and Morrissey, as well as five online stores, will accept Monero as payment during the holiday season.
It's a smart move for Monero, affording it at least some form of legitimacy. But will this go at least some way toward obscuring the fact of its popularity among hackers, money launderers and other criminal types? Right now, social media remains full of Monero-related gibes about how the cryptocurrency is used for dodgy deals or is ideal for apocalyptic events:
All of which begs the question, is Monero's unique privacy setting a good idea? Jeff Mahony, founder and CEO of UbiquiCoin, a decentralized digital currency, thinks so. He says:
While Monero's privacy features and ease of mining have helped it grow in popularity, they are the same reasons it has become so popular among hackers and criminals.
Despite the recent negative press, Maksim Izmaylov, founder and CEO of Winding Tree, a blockchain non-profit startup, believes the overall crypto-craze is beneficial to the society at large since it forces us to improve security:
“We...have to be aware that in the information era we all should be able to protect our accounts and our information, including using adequate protection against malware. Regarding the Starbucks' provider, it's not the first time a company is using dubious practices to make money. But I think it's a brilliant way to monetize free Wi-Fi networks. I'd sacrifice 10 seconds of my time to get a good connection, if they disclosed what's going on in the background. Regarding Transfer, I think they just have very poor security measures if they allowed that to happen.”
Compared to blockchain, the technology Monero uses was developed with a different objective in mind. After all, privacy can be highly desirable, if it's not misused. So what are Monero's positives? Graeme Moore, an executive at Polymath, a securities token platform, notes:
”Privacy coins, in general, are very interesting from an investment standpoint. Having the ability to send the value in a truly private manner has an incredible amount of use cases (that extend far beyond criminals and drug dealers). One notable use case: People sending money to political or activist organizations and preferring to conceal their identity. If you intend to purchase privacy coins purely as an investment, I recommend purchasing Monero, , and . One of these coins will likely become the "winner" of private transactions, and at this point, it is difficult to predict which one.”
Perry Woodin, CEO of Node40, a blockchain governance and cryptocurrency tax compliance company based in New York, thinks opaque, privacy-focused blockchain applications such as Monero are also interesting from a computer science perspective:
“Mainstream adoption is likely not the goal of Monero. The digital currencies that will thrive over the next decade will need to support compliance. If a regulatory agency is unable to verify and analyze transactions on the blockchain, there isn't much hope for mainstream adoption. Business will opt for currencies that can operate within the bounds of government regulation. Privacy-focused digital currencies like Monero and Zcash will have to settle for the fringes where parties to transactions are happy to operate outside the reach of regulatory agencies.”
There's no doubt regulators will eventually move in and clamp down on the global cryptocurrency craze which is currently having its dotcom moment. Recent Monero mining highjacking incidents highlight how critical cybersecurity and crypto regulation are. Will Monero be able to cross over from the dark side and gain legitimacy? Hard to tell, but as the tenth-most popular digital currency right now, investors aren't shying away from Monero, which could bode well for the token's future.
I don't expect to change the minds of any of the 35 writers who have now joined the protest against PEN America giving an award to Charlie Hebdo magazine. Some of the signatories I respect hugely, one or two sycophantic wind-vane weasels on the list I would normally ignore, and at least one of the signatories is a close friend, someone who I'm sure has given this whole business much thought. How this motley bunch ends up signing one ill-judged letter I don't know, but they're wrong. Here's why.
The main argument being squeezed to pulp is that CH was, and is, an inherently racist magazine. That it is staffed by "privileged white men", who either deliberately or like "wanton boys", continuously defecate on a beleaguered minority (French Muslims, whether from the Maghreb or other parts of Africa) while making their jejune barbs. That they've been doing this while ignoring France's history of colonial oppression, and while trying to impose a shallow Enlightenment universalism that blindly feeds into the West's project of re-colonizing Muslim countries.
This is untrue on almost every count. CH has always been run by a kind of fringe leftist-anarchist bunch who are anything but privileged; over the years the team has been a mix of men and women, white and not, straight and gay. And as to constantly attacking an already oppressed minority, Le Monde recently did an infographic of the 523 Charlie Hebdo covers between 2005 and 2015, and the subject breakdown is this: politics - 336 covers, economic and social - 85, sport and others - 42, other subjects - 22, and, finally, religion - 38. Of the 38 covers lampooning religion, Christianity catches it in the neck 21 times, other religions 10 times and Islam a total of 7 times. Leaving that aside for a moment, CH's main targets by far have been the racist, white supremacist Front National led by Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter, and after them a certain Nicolas Sarkozy (remember those 336 political covers). Besides this, CH has made it a point to lampoon the military, oligarchs of every nationality, and capitalism in general. Here's a link that explains in some detail what some of the more startling covers and cartoons mean: http://www.understandingcharliehebdo.com/#theorie-du-genre
All the critics of CH I know, Facebook contacts claiming to be anarchist, artist friends taking on big business, academic friends who so love to drop names of hefty lefty intellectuals, journalists who are assiduous in defending minorities, none of them addresses the major part of CH's output. None of them, not once. Instead, they prefer to put a magnifying glass on about 1.5 per cent of what the magazine has produced in the last decade. They then take this and claim they have a fair fix on CH and its staff. Ten years, 523 issues, but, like some pungent spicing, those 7 covers obviously go a long way.
The second argument, piggybacking on the first, claims that CH is not an "equal opportunity" offender between Islam and Zionism, that it is very soft on Israel and Zionists. This is claimed despite CH's searing cartoons on what Israel is doing in Gaza, and regardless of its lampooning, from time to time, of evil-looking rabbis. The point CH's staff keep trying to make is that there is a difference between actual racism and using racist or homophobic tropes and archetypes to make vicious fun of the people who subscribe to these reactionary ideas. No critic seems to take on the point that Charb (Stéphane Charbonnier, the murdered editor) makes in a book that was published posthumously: "Really, the word 'Islamophobia' is badly chosen if it's supposed to describe the hatred which some lame-brains have for Muslims... it is dangerous... isn't it odd that 'Muslimophobia', or just 'racism', isn't used instead of 'Islamophobia'? ...because those who campaign against Islamophobia don't do so to defend Muslims as individuals. They do so to defend the religion of the prophet Mohamed."
You don't need to be an atheist to say. "Let divine beings and revelations defend themselves, it's the rights of individuals that centrally concern us." There are many in India - people who've become so desperate to "protect" the "feelings" of every little sub-group even as they dismantle the deep structures of our secularism - who may find this hard to digest, but Charlie Hebdo was and is a magazine that was proudly religiophobic - that is, it held all religions in equal contempt as demonstrated by its covers that simultaneously lampoon the three major religions of France, showing a triumvirate of fanatical, wild-eyed priest-mullah-rabbi, or three rolls of toilet paper, each with the name of one of the three 'qitabiya' holy books. Now, this broad-spectrum anti-religiosity is neither the invention of the Enlightenment nor exclusive to the West. We in the sub-continent have a long tradition of iconoclasticism that stretches from Gautam Buddha through Chaitanya, Kabir and Lalon Fakir, through various tribal and urban subaltern groups. At various points in our history, people have needed to tear down idols or bring down big, organized religions a peg or several in order to privilege the current earthly rights of humans. Each tearing down is usually balanced by the raising up of some other principle or belief. It might be a stretch, but not a big one, to place CH in some lineage of radical heretics, their replacement of older beliefs being a fanatical adherence to the mantras of liberté-fraternité-égalité and ni maître, ni dieu [no master, no god]. A majority of South Asians, Indians dealing currently with ghar wapsi, love jihad and beef bans, Bangladeshis with their bloggers being murdered simply for questioning the existence of god, Pakistan with its attacks on girls trying to go to school, may find this brash celebration of atheism hard to understand, but the sophisticated world citizens, the 35 authors who signed the PEN protest letter should have done a bit better.
The letter signed by the PEN protesters says: "to the section of the French population that is already marginalized, embattled, and victimized, a population that is shaped by the legacy of France's various colonial enterprises, and that contains a large percentage of devout Muslims, Charlie Hebdo's cartoons of the Prophet must be seen as being intended to cause further humiliation and suffering".
This argument is appalling. It is specious, patronizing and hypocritical. Defending his stance, Teju Cole has said he would have stood up for Salman Rushdie against the Khomeini fatwa of 1989, but that he can't condone what CH has been doing. Cole has clearly obliterated that fatwa moment when all sorts of literary worthies bandwagoned against Rushdie, accusing him of exactly this: irresponsible boy-prankery and the intention to cause further humiliation and suffering to devout Muslims - in this case, marginalized British Muslims, embattled and victimized under Thatcher; legacy of British colonial enterprise; same suspects, different passports.
There weren't too many working-class Muslims in late 1980s Britain, devout or otherwise, who were readers of Salman Rushdie's novels; the Muslim youths (largely male) who thronged the streets of Bradford and London demanding death for Rushdie had been told by their cynical community leaders that there was such and such a book that contained such and such insults against their prophet. Equally, as Charb argues in his posthumous book, until the media and the Islam-squeezing community leaders took over, no working-class French Maghrebi or African was overly exercised by an obscure satirical magazine read by the Lefty fringe. As he says, "because the Charlie Hebdo drawings do not have the vast majority of Muslims as their target...We believe that Muslims are capable of recognising a tongue-in-cheek. By what twisted argument should Islam be less compatible with humour than other religions?...If you argue that you can laugh at everything, except certain aspects of Islam - because Muslims are much more sensitive than the rest of the population - aren't you practising a kind of discrimination?"
Since it first ran a cartoon of Mohammad in 2006, without any riots, Charlie Hebdo's message to whichever Muslim willing to open its pages was this: hello, fellow French citoyen, let's laugh together at the different forces trying to en-bamboo our happiness; if you happen to be Muslim, please don't allow yourself to be further skewered by these crazy, power-hungry mullahs, you've enough problems as it is; oh, does it actually say in some 7th century text that you can't portray your prophet? Well, get over it, here's a cartoon of your prophet, alongside several cartoons of Jesus, another prophet-type, linked to another fantastical text that others hold sacred, just laugh and move on; don't listen to the mullahs, don't get your knickers in a twist; again, look! we've got those two real, tangible shaitans, Le Pen papa and daughter coming to get us all!
All the 35 signatories agree that the massacre of the CH staff was unconscionable, their objection is to those people being deemed heroes and awarded posthumously by PEN America. I've never seen 35 (mostly) serious writers being more wrong, all together in a sheep-pen of delusion. Charb and the CH team were and are heroes. They carried on, sticking to their principles, under covert and overt attack from several different sides, the Right, the mainstream Left, the Mullahs, the media. They did this without resorting to any physical violence, and without profit, pomposity or bombast. They may have been guilty of 'bad taste', despite having been attacked earlier they were guilty of undercalculating the extent of the danger they faced, but they were heroes. In a time when the word, shaheed, is so evilly misused, they are true shaheeds to the cause of humanity, free speech and irreverent laughter.
Karlsruhe, 16/8/2017 – SoulWorker, the action MMORPG from development studio Lion Games, is ready to make its launch in Europe and North America. Already live in South Korea, publisher Gameforge announces plans to start the open beta of this exciting Anime-styled title at the end of 2017. With breathtaking gameplay which places great emphasis on the players' speed and skill, the game world presents a fascinating contrast between the grim dystopian setting and the vivid flamboyance of its characters. Moulded by a desolate past, their tormented souls manifest themselves as weapons. These remain the heroes' trusty allies in the enthralling struggle against the savage demons infiltrating their world.
SoulWorker is a South Korean multiplayer action RPG with an enthralling Anime style. The focus of the game is on high-energy battles in a third-person perspective. Using keyboard and mouse, or controller if they choose, players take on the role of a young chosen one, who has to fight against menacing forces in a post-apocalyptic world. Each character has access to a particularly special emotion, such as revenge or madness, which then defines their class and their weapon. Using these feelings, the young heroes unleash special abilities that distinguish themselves as SoulWorkers, and use them skilfully in battle for class-specific attack and defence manoeuvres.
Features
Action-packed 4-player coop RPG gameplay
Up to 4 players can dynamically team up and defeat hordes of enemies though a unique action gameplay requiring skill, strategy and courage. Players get to create their own customized combos to make a devastating strike force to face off against giant bosses.
Playable Anime
The high quality cel-shaded visuals shine just as bright on low-spec machines. Dynamic storytelling with complete voice-overs, cut-scenes and Picture in Picture make of SoulWorker a unique playable Anime that players can perfectly fit to their preferences due to its deep customisation system and interactive universe.
Enthralling Anime story based on mankind's battle for survival
Hordes of enemies threaten the barely standing world of SoulWorker: there's not only beasts from other dimensions, but also a private military conglomerate and other power-thirsty foes trying to wipe out all of humanity.
Large PvE content with adventurous dungeons
Over 100 PvE dungeons with episodic final bosses are split across different difficulty levels. The initial instances tell the story behind SoulWorker, whilst adventures in regions with a higher level or daily challenges offer opportunities for big rewards.
Four classes at launch
At launch there'll be four classes to choose from, each providing a true Anime feel. Players can decide whether to use ‘Soulum Sword', ‘Mist Scythe', ‘Gun Jazz' or ‘Howling Guitar'. An optimised third-person camera makes the action-laden battles shine and serves to highlight the beauty of the real-time effects.
A couple of months ago, I was invited to participate in a think tank on bridging divides within Jewish communities. There are so many groups and factions that form the fabric of Jewish Peoplehood. How can we all deeply connect with – not just recognize – one another?
A tall order, many would argue.
The room was filled with all types: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Renewal; men and women; advocates for LGBTQ Jews and other marginalized identities; pro-Israel leaders, self-proclaimed anti-Zionists, Rabbis, lay leaders, white Jews, black Jews, brown Jews – and many others.
We were formed into smaller groups: a young educator and entrepreneur from Brooklyn's Syrian community; an older man and researcher, a self-described “secular and liberal Jew;” and me, a Sephardic, Hasidic woman. As requested by the moderator (a Reform Rabbi), we each shared our personal stories of acceptance and estrangement within our respective Jewish community.
The conversation flowed effortlessly, each one of us revealing another layer of identity, aspiration – and even pain. Did we feel like we belonged to the greater Jewish community? To our own? Why? Why not? How were we each challenging the status quo within our communities – and what did we assume to be true about others?
This felt like a unique opportunity, a certain raw energy in the air. I was moved to respectfully ask the older gentlemen, the “most Orthodox, secular Jew you'll ever meet,” what he thought of me, a Hasidic woman from an insular community.
I took a deep breath.
“Do you imagine I am oppressed, repressed, stuck inside archaic rules that are no longer relevant?”
He paused, looked at me in the eye and asked, “As a Reform Jew, do you believe my practice is flawed?”
A moment of truth.
Perhaps this is what is means to cross the divide.
There are things we think, beliefs we hold, that are rarely expressed to those for whom it matters most. And in that moment, I only cared to be honest – fully transparent.
And what ensued was a respectful dialogue in which we both shared: his thoughts on particular laws toward women he finds oppressive; my thoughts on the eternal relevance of halacha and G-d's need (so to say) for each of us, in the individual way we serve Him, “your mission is just as unique, just as valuable, as mine.”
The most powerful moment in our exchange was this aha moment we shared together: we each assumed the other held a bias toward us– and we each communicated to the other through that perceived bias. But in essence, as our conversation revealed, that bias did not exist. Our assumptions were wrong.
We assume that others in the broader Jewish community judge us, so we act like we're being judged.
Yes, I am a Hasidic, Sephardic woman. Because of my work and personal passions (education reform across the spectrum of Jewish communities) I very regularly meet and connect with Jews of all types. And the story I tell myself is that all they see when they look at me is how different I am from them. How my work, my beliefs, my community, my people – and our pain – are less relevant to them than their own. How there is no room in the “progressive” community for Hasidic beliefs, passions and communal aspirations.
Perhaps I am wrong?
What could happen if we were to assume no biases and truly connect to one another? Communicate, heart to heart? Stop projecting our stories and be authentic?
What could transpire if we let go of assumptions and unite?
What could happen if, as the gentleman stated, we stop “waiting for the other side to do teshuvah“?
So much. So, so much.
Yet what could, and should, bring us together beyond the negation of perceived biases?
Letting go of assumptions is not enough.
We attempt to unite Jews over shared culture, values, identity or ritual. Yet today, many Jews share none of that. North American Jewry is divided, subdivided and further divided into communities of different beliefs, practice, and customs (and now, more than ever, politics).
What do we have in common, anyway? (Even shared victimhood is harder to achieve.) How do we define our sense of Peoplehood? In an age and culture that values the individual over the collective, is that notion even relevant?
And in a world seemingly absent of Soul, what's the point of Peoplehood, anyway?
We live in a fragmented world of artificial barriers: between our hearts and minds; our inner world and public persona; the ‘mundane' and ‘holy.' Classic Jewish texts explain that the mission of each Jew and our people collectively is to create wholeness within the world, our community and ourselves.
Our job is to show that fragmentation is not real.
I'm ready to drop the labels. Let go of the stories. Speak authentically, show curiosity, and throw bias to the wind.
I'm ready to reach for your soul.
We are one People, united by a deep sense of purpose that speaks to an underlying, spiritual bond — that surpasses any divide.
The Robert Rodriguez Movie No One Will See for 100 Years
The Robert Rodriguez Movie No One Will See for 100 Years
Share. In theaters November, 2115. In theaters November, 2115.
The film 100 Years, starring Robert Rodriguez and John Malkovich, won't be seen until November 18, 2115.
100 Years is a promotion for Louis XIII Cognac, which is aged 100 years. Louis XIII approached John Malkovich for an idea, but we don't know exactly what it is yet.
According to io9, we do know that 100 Years is set in the present and Robert Rodriguez says that it is "emotionally charged."
There are three teasers for the movie, but rather than giving away any details, they are just different representations of what the world might be in 100 years time when the film is removed from its time-locked safe.
“There were several options when the project was first presented of what [the future] would be,” said Malkovich. “An incredibly high tech, beyond computerized version of the world, a post-Chernoybl, back to nature, semi-collapsed civilization and then there was a retro future which was how the future was imagined in science fiction of the 1940s or 50s.”
Louis XIII is sending out 1,000 metal tickets to the movie that will grant their descendants access to the screening of 100 Years, in 100 years time.

Lotus have sealed a new contract to continue with Renault engines in Formula 1 for the next five years.
The announcement was timed to coincide with the first public appearance of the their car at the second pre-season test after missing the first test in Spain.
The two parties said they had signed a deal "for 2014 and beyond".
But BBC Sport has learned the contract lasts until 2018, which underlines both parties' commitment to F1 despite Lotus's recent cash-flow problems.
It is the beginning of a new era and we are pleased to embrace it together with Renault Sport F1 Matthew Carter Lotus chief executive officer
The team finished fourth in the constructors' championship last year, but lead driver Kimi Raikkonen quit the team with two races still to go because he had not been paid.
Lotus has this year replaced the Finn, who has moved to Ferrari, with Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado, who brings with him about £30m of annual sponsorship from his country's national oil company.
Lotus is owned by the investment group Genii Capital, which re-named the team after buying it from Renault at the end of 2009. The team, as Renault, won the 2005 and 2006 world titles with Fernando Alonso.
Lotus chief executive officer Matthew Carter said: "Lotus F1 team and Renault Sport F1 have enjoyed a successful partnership these past few years and we look forward to continuing to build on our relationship and collaboration in 2014 and beyond.
"It is the beginning of a new era in Formula 1 and we are pleased to embrace it together with Renault Sport F1."
F1 is this year introducing the biggest rule changes for a generation, with the advent of complex and high-tech 1.6-litre V6 hybrid turbo engines.
Renault has had a troubled start to its pre-season programme but its engineering chief Remi Taffin said after the first day of testing in Bahrain on Wednesday that the company was now "on plan but still recovering".
He said he expected by the end of the final test later this month that Renault "will have a specification we will be happy with" which can be used at the first race of the season in Melbourne, Australia on 16 March.
CTV Vancouver
The City of Vancouver has designated 25 sites across the region as disaster support hubs as part of its earthquake preparedness strategy.
City officials say the hubs will “empower Vancouverites to work together,” as well as coordinate rescue efforts in the event of an emergency.
“After a major disaster strikes, neighbourhoods and communities that organize to help and support each other are often the first to recover,” said Daniel Stevens, director of emergency management, in a statement.
The sites were chosen because they are either at or near places where people can gather outside if buildings are damaged. Twenty-three of the locations are community centres, one is a library, and the other is downtown's Oppenheimer Park.
Yellow signs have also been installed at all disaster support hub locations.
It's not just earthquakes the hubs will be used for: the city plans to use them for cooling centres during heat waves, warming centres during extreme cold, lodging for residents after a house fire, and in case of chemical or gas leaks.
The hubs will allow communities to better coordinate response efforts, the city adds, as well as facilitate the sharing of supplies, resources, and information, and will help families reconnect after a disaster.
“Disaster Support Hubs help enable a community-led response to take place,” Johnston said.
The magnitude 4.3 quake that rattled B.C.'s south coast at the end of December 2015 highlighted the need for earthquake preparedness.
A plan released by the province's Emergency Management branch earlier this year estimated a shallow 7.3-magnitude earthquake underneath Vancouver would kill roughly 10,000 people and injure another 128,000.
Given how tied up emergency resources would in a worst-case scenario such as that, officials strongly urge the public to plan to take care of themselves for the first 72 hours, at least.
Some of the government's advice includes that families have a plan for where to meet and how to contact one another in the wake of a disaster.
People should also have an emergency kit ready with at least two litres of water per person, per day, food that won't spoil such as canned goods and energy bars, a crank or battery-powered flashlight, a first aid kit and other items.

On Thursday Nov. 9, Edina High School held its annual Veterans Day Assembly. Controversy broke out when the EHS Young Conservatives Club tweeted a video of a group of 10 students sitting down during the song ‘Taps.' The incident gained attention because unlike the national anthem, ‘Taps' has historically been played to remember fallen soldiers. The Young Conservatives Club called the protesters “disrespectful,” and tensions rose as the post was shared and angry commenters responded to it.
An unnamed junior who participated in the demonstration says that the message they hoped to send was simple. “We don't want to stand, so we shouldn't be forced to,” she said. Another unnamed protester added, “This was a way to firmly express our beliefs without intentionally jeopardizing our reputation and safety.” Many students thought the EHS Black Student Union organized the demonstration, but the participant clarified, “the Black Student Union was not involved in the demonstration.” She went on to explain that, “this was a collection of people's individual choices not to stand.” Principal Andy Beaton clarified the student's rights saying, “The bottom line with this particular instance is that students are not required to stand for the national anthem, or ‘Taps' or the pledge,” he said.
The day after the assembly, tweets were sent out by an anonymous Twitter account named “EHS Anti-Fascists.” These tweets consisted of screenshots from the YCC “GroupMe,” a platform for online group chats, discussing the protest. While some messages were simply criticising the intent of the protest, others displayed blatant racism. One member singled out a protester specifically saying, “he can barely speak English.” Another message said of the protesters, “at least we can relish in the fact that none of them are going to college and won't amount to anything.” More messages called the protesters “crazy” and “stupid” and suggested the protesters should leave the United States saying, “let's all do something nice and pitch in for a plane ticket.” One of the unnamed protesters described her reaction to seeing these comments. “I am completely disappointed and not surprised at the comments and messages Young Conservative Club keeps making. They are using their political platform for their racist views.” Another protester said, “I have known these kids since middle school, I didn't know they had the capability to say these things. Reading the messages made me cry.” When contacted, the YCC declined to comment.
Zephyrus has been in contact with the EHS Anti-Fascists over Twitter but does not know their identities. When asked why they posted the screenshots, they explained,“The comments in the Young Conservatives Club group chat were completely unacceptable, and it became abundantly clear to us that the issue was never going to get solved internally.” They intentionally censored the names of the YCC members, saying the point was not to expose individuals but the group as a whole. They went on to say, “The students of EHS needed to know that the Young Conservatives Club was fostering racism, and leaking their comments to the public was the best way to achieve that.”
The administration's jurisdiction over social media posts falls into somewhat of a grey area. Although the YCC is not currently a school-sanctioned club (it has been in the past), it uses the “EHS” name on social media platforms like Twitter and is clearly associated with the school. (The EHS Anti-Fascists are not a school-sanctioned club either, it should be noted.) Principal Beaton explained, “The Young Conservatives Club is allowed to post something and say, we totally disagree with students sitting during [the assembly], but when the statements become disrespectful, that's when we have to step in.” Beaton clarified the views of the club leaders, whom he had talked to at length on Friday, saying, “they are apologetic and frustrated and disavowing some of [the messages], saying being a conservative doesn't mean being a racist.” The YCC Twitter account has since been taken down.
Tensions grew over the weekend and the EHS Anti-Fascists sparked even more controversy. They posted a video to their Twitter account depicting a figure in a Guy Fawkes mask, a disguise often used by the prominent hacking group Anonymous. The video demanded the removal of every student who displayed racism in the Young Conservatives Club from their group, and an apology for “fostering racism in their official GroupMe.” They further threatened to send the screenshots, with the commenter's names exposed, to the school administration if the YCC did not meet their criteria. The EHS Anti-Fascists' video concluded by calling their demands “non-negotiable.”
The anonymous video was deemed threatening by many, even prompting some YCC members to leave school Monday, Nov. 13, fearing for their own safety. Yet, the anonymous group defended the video saying, “we knew before releasing the video that it was going to be blown out of proportion, but it needed to be made.” Despite the video being taken down the same afternoon, they consider it successful. “The Young Conservatives Club never made a unified response to our stipulation, and later that day they were contacted by EHS administration to dismantle their Twitter and GroupMe. We are grateful to the EHS administration for finally taking action, but think more still needs to be done.” One of the aforementioned Veterans Day assembly protesters did not agree with the video's message saying, “we want the racists to be punished, but we don't want them to be threatened by anyone.”
Principal Beaton called the video “inflammatory and unnecessary,” adding that “it got forwarded to the police department and its origins are being investigated.” The Star Tribune reports that the police found no “credible threat,” however Principal Beaton indicated that the investigation will continue. This incident comes after a tense fall at EHS, including a student protest regarding enforcement of the school's dress code. Beaton's responses to both incidents condemned social media for exacerbating rumors and fostering a mob mentality.
Moving forward, Beaton hopes that if people see harassment or racism on social media they will, “screenshot it, come and see us and we will handle it.” He also hopes to “continue the conversation about the appropriate use of social media.”

Rocket League is being updated today to support cross-play between Xbox One and PC, developer Psyonix announced this morning. This is notable ("a historic moment in multiplayer gaming," the developer says) because Rocket League becomes the first Xbox One game to allow cross-play with PC.
Lionhead's Fable Legends was also going to offer cross-play between Xbox One and PC, but that game was canceled. The PlayStation 4 version of Rocket League already supports cross-play with PC.
Psyonix also announced today that almost 2 million people have now played Rocket League on Xbox One since its launch in February. That doesn't necessarily mean the game has sold that many copies on Microsoft's console, however. Whatever the case, cross-play with PC will undoubtedly increase the pool of available players.
When cross-play goes live at 3 PM PST / 6 PM EST today, Xbox One players can choose to include--or prohibit--PC players from their matches by checking a box in the Options menu.
"We're really excited to bring Xbox One and PC players closer together," Psyonix VP Jeremy Dunham said in a statement. "Cross-network play has been something that Xbox One gamers have been asking us for since the day we launched, and thanks to Microsoft's new cross-network policies, w''re proud to give it to them."
In March, Microsoft made a big announcement when it said it would natively support cross-platform play between Xbox One, Windows 10, and other "online multiplayer networks." The move effectively opens the Xbox Live platform so that it can accommodate players on Sony's PlayStation Network, among others.
There have been no Xbox One/PS4 cross-play games yet, but Rocket League could be the first, if it's ever allowed. Psyonix said it's not a technical matter holding it back, but rather it's an issue of politics.
"The only thing we have to do now is sort of find out where we stand politically with everyone, and then it's full steam ahead to finish the solution that we've already started," Dunham said in March.
Fog and mist are both created by water droplets, differing only in their overall locations and density. Fog is a cloud that reaches ground level, even if that "ground" is a hill or mountaintop. Mist forms wherever water droplets are suspended in the air by temperature inversion, volcanic activity, or changes in humidity. Fog is denser than mist and tends to last longer. In terms of visibility, fog reduces it to less than one kilometer (0.6 miles), while mist can reduce visibility to between 1 and 2 kilometers (0.6 - 1.2 miles).
Mist vs. Fog Causes
Fog is formed when any cloud type makes contact with the ground. In low-lying areas, such as valleys and plains, the fog bank (a mass of fog) is essentially a cloud formation subject to the same wind and temperature reactions clouds experience in the upper atmosphere.
Clouds form when water droplets condense and merge, but fail to achieve a size large enough to precipitate as rain. Clouds will form or drift closer to the ground when humidity rises or changes abruptly, or when wind speeds drop or acutely change direction.
Mist is also formed by water droplets, but with less merging or coalescing. This means mist is less dense and quicker to dissipate when wind, temperature, or relative humidity changes. Mists can form due to abrupt temperature changes (such as when exhaling in cold air), high levels of humidity (in a sauna, for example), or from evaporation or condensation, such as when rain hits sun-warmed rocks and street surfaces or evening allows dew to form.
Effects on Visibility
Fog is much denser than mist and thus has a greater effect on visibility. A person can still see out to about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) in mist, but a fog will reduce visibility to under one kilometer (0.6 miles). Dense fogs, usually caused by rapid changes in humidity or combined with smoke, can reduce visibility to under 50 meters (60 yards). London's infamous "pea-soup fogs" of the 19th century were said to reduce visibility to less than 20 feet.
How to Drive Safely in Fog and Mist
When driving in misty conditions, it is important for drivers to use wipers with care. The water droplets in mist are often not dense enough to require the constant use of wipers, so intermittent patterns will probably do a better job of keeping the windshield clear. In foggy conditions, wipers might play a smaller role to that of fog lights or driving lights. In some dense fogs, headlights or "long" lights will actually reduce visibility as the light is reflected by the fog itself. To check for best visibility, a driver should flick between headlights and fog lights to gauge visibility with each. This also serves as a warning signal to oncoming drivers.
Driving "past your lights," means that the limit of visibility is constantly exceeded (the speed is too fast to react to what appears out of the fog or mist) and one is "driving blind." It is best for drivers to slow down in that situation. If the driving speed in the fog drops to half of the posted maximum speed, it is a good idea for drivers to find a safe spot to pull well off the road and wait for the fog to clear. Many accidents are caused in fog banks by cars going too slow and being hit from behind. When pulling off the road, drivers should keep their car's hazard lights flashing for additional safety.
In the following video, driving safety instructor Zundrea Baldwin gives further tips on how to drive safely in foggy conditions.

The Ford Granada of the late '70s is hardly what you'd call exciting. More of something you'd see driven by an old man in his 70s, right?
We thought so, too… until some guys out of Norway decided to give his Granada a heart transplant. You can guess where this is going.
Swapping out the 600hp (447kW) Cosworth engine they had installed in 2008, these guys then dropped in a 4.7-litre V8 from the Koenigsegg CCX. With twin-turbochargers added, the big ‘8 boasts an insane power output of 1700 horsepower, or 1267kW in the new tongue.
By the way: if you're wondering why you're looking at an XD Ford Falcon, you'd be forgiven, because the European-market Mk II Granada's design was a big influence on Ford's big Aussie sedan from the late 70s.
The car's owner was about to buy an R32 Skyline to replace his Cosworth-powered Granada, but then changed his mind and decided to completely modify the big Ford he has been the proud owner of for 12 years.
Other upgrades include the rear suspension setup from the 2004 Ford Mustang Cobra R, along with the brakes from an unnamed Porsche model.
Extensive work was done on the car's chassis so it could handle such a huge power upgrade and to fit all the beefed-up performance parts, though you wouldn't be able to tell from its rather stock-looking final design.

And… Voila! What do you think?

A North Carolina resident bought a freezer for $30 at a neighbor's yard sale — only to discover an elderly woman's body inside, police and local media said Wednesday.
The Goldsboro Police Department said the remains were confirmed to be those of a local woman who died of natural causes. It did not identify the woman.
The body was "intact and not dismembered in any way," the police department said in a statement following an autopsy Wednesday.
The woman who found the body told NBC station WRAL she bought the freezer at a neighbor's yard sale last month. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said the seller told her there were several items inside the freezer for a Sunday school project, which would be collected by a local church.
Three weeks later the woman opened the freezer and saw a frozen foot, according to WRAL. "I was just in shock," she told the station. "I opened it up for a second time and my heart went into my throat. I ran out of the house and called 911."
Police said they were called last Friday after the woman opened the fridge. Officers were investigating the class-one felony of failing to notify of the death of a person, the force added.
Functional programming was nowhere to be seen during my time at University, nor in my professional career, that is up until the point Scala came out of its shell. Object oriented programming had ruled and the only time I had heard much about functional languages were stories from more experienced engineers, most of which usually started with “back in the day”. In my mind that translated to an era of floppy disk drives and ASM programming, I took no notice.
I remember sitting in a SkillsMatter training course with a Typesafe representative, we had just finished a chapter on the fundamental basics of Scala, I was completely new to the notion of a map function, what had happened to the safe haven of imperative code?
In the beginning
Coming from a team of solid Java developers I was initially quite apprehensive, early proof of concept work had been frustrating and getting setup was cumbersome. IntelliJ was tripping over its own heels, traversing Scala documentation that spanned multiple versions of libraries was a battle, compile times seemed sluggish and SBT was another build/dependency management tool to add to the ever-growing list. All this on top of pressures to deliver project features.
Diving into a full new technology stack and language can be rather daunting, especially when there is no prior expertise in your team. Although most good developers are able to pick up Scala through self learning, having some formal training or even better, some short-term experienced Scala contractors (with the primary purpose to knowledge share) fast tracked the team to getting their skills off the ground.
Rather than move to a full Scala stack in one swoop we opted to take a more methodical approach. First we replaced our Java based integration tests with Scala ones, this allowed the developers to learn the fundamentals of Scala without compromising any production projects or code. Once the team was comfortable with the fundamentals of the language we decided to build our next production project in Scala.
Reaping the rewards
Although the surrounding landscape had initially left much to desire, the advantages of the language itself were soon apparent, to name but a few:
more concise code – the syntax and features of Scala strip away a lot of the unnecessary boiler plate that Java enforces while native language features provide solutions to common engineering patterns. Case classes, traits, type inference, optional braces, partial functions, pattern matching, implicit conversions, lazy val and more, it all plays a part.
let's get functional – Scala treats functions as first class citizens, the ability to compose functions, create anonymous functions and pass them around really makes the language much more powerful when designing your code architecture.
less time coding – Once the team became proficient with Scala, the productivity of our team improved, this is something I observed as a general improvement in my own velocity and my colleagues.
the JVM ecosystem – Scala is a JVM language which meant we still had all of the Java libraries at our disposable, this was particularly important for us as it reduced some of the pressure during the transition period. Familiar technologies such as Apache HTTP Commons, Camel, Spring, Apache CXF and many more could still be used which reduced risk and allowed a more methodical transition to a full Scala stack.
collections – Scala collections are immutable by default and it's not until we really started to use Scala that a majority of problems can be solved without the use of mutable ones. Immutable collections are much easier to reason about, there are less variables and branching statements to consider. On top of this all collections support functional operators such as map, flatMap, collect, fold (and more) allowing you to perform powerful transformations with ease.
a reduction in bugs…perhaps – this is quite a subjective statement and comes from my personal experience working on multiple commercial Java projects. Logic bugs that we have seen being raised seemed reduced compared to similar past projects. By logic bugs I mean things like null pointer exceptions, undesired results due to errors in branching logic and just plain business logic mistakes.
I suspect this comes from the ability to write more concise and expressive code with focus on the “happy path” using the functional paradigm. On top of this Scala collections are immutable by default, immutably reduces complexity and makes testing easier, along with the ability to compose behaviour using higher order functions and traits. All these factors seem to contribute to the quality of our systems which I believe had a direct impact on the types and quantity of bugs. Of course some of this reduction may be attributed to more focus on automated testing, better testing frameworks and engineering practices……or maybe it's all just placebo, I'll let you decide.
The landscape now
The landscape for Scala development has improved greatly over the past few years, Scala 2.11 seems to have stabilised, SBT continuous compile mode offsets the longer compilation time allowing you to get feedback fast, there have been major improvements in IntelliJ support, and we also have the Typesafe Activator, which is arguably the easiest way to get started with a Scala application. On top of this we still have the full JVM eco-system at our disposable.
I would like to stress that for the same reasons Scala allows you to write succulent and elegant code, it's versatility can be a double-edged sword.
There are a lot of programmers out there who are incredibly smart, sometimes too smart. In the few short years I have been working with Scala, I have seen several examples where Engineers have been lulled into writing unnecessarily complex solutions at the expense of readability and maintainability. I think Scala is a language which can be more susceptible to abuse in this area but as with any language, code quality reviews and established coding standards can mitigate these issues. My advice to those adopting Scala is to carefully choose the patterns and features you adopt, make sure your engineers are comfortable and just take it slow.
A great starting point on providing style and implementation advice is the Twitter Effective Scala guide by Marius Eriksen, I couldn't recommend it enough. In my opinion, the best Scala learning resource on the web is The Neophyte's Guide to Scala by Daniel Westheide, this blog series is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anybody currently learning Scala.
As a final note, I would like to leave you with a point I feel is rarely mentioned. Programming in Scala is FUN. The language is powerful, flexible and versatile giving you the opportunity to solve problems in the most elegant way, this really does make coding fun again. I'm sure you will all agree, happier engineers are always a good thing in any tech organisation, who can argue with that?!
After one of those arrests, Ms. DeCurtis testified on Tuesday, “everybody just stood up and applauded.”
But Mr. Clifford testified that, deep down, many of his fellow passengers were grateful, but were too scared to speak up. “When I sit on the train it's quiet,” he said. “I get up, people come over and shake my hand. They say: ‘Thank you. I wanted to rip her throat out.' ”
Outside court, he compared himself to Rosa Parks, fighting for his right to sit where he wanted in peace.
“Look what happened to her,” he said, pointing out that Parks was punished for her stand against discrimination. In court, however, he sometimes sounded like the Miss Manners of the railroad, blaming the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the railroad's parent agency, for not enforcing its own etiquette rules, which restrict noise to 70 decibels under some circumstances.

He had bought a noise meter and found that the train alone measured 70 decibels. “When you're talking across the car it goes to 80 decibels,” he testified.
Although he seemed like a perfect client for a civil rights lawyer, he chose to represent himself. He has a law degree.
Dressed in a blue Oxford shirt, wearing glasses, and with close-cropped gray hair, he looked lawyerly as he was sworn in to testify. Mr. Clifford said that he routinely took up a section of five facing seats because he was 6-foot-4 and suffered from backaches. It was, he said, the only place where he could cross his legs to ease the pain. He offered to show his scar from a back operation to Judge Larry Stephen, who declined.

“Do I admit to being domineering?” he testified. “Yeah.”
He described his usual routine on the 7:39 or the 8:03 from Long Beach to his job as a private investigator in Manhattan: “I eat. I mind my own business. I read my paper. I get to work.” Interfering with that routine, he said, was “this clique that think it's their absolute right to talk as long and as loud as they like.”
Only one clique? the prosecutor asked.
“There are different cliques throughout the train,” he replied. “Throughout every train.”
He said that in October 2006, Ms. DeCurtis deliberately provoked him by talking to one of her friends across the aisle.

“They're talking from one side of the train to the other,” he testified. “That aggravates me. I can't concentrate. I can't catch up on current events, and it gives me a headache, so I tell them off.”
Judge Stephen gently interjected, “You can move to another car, can't you?”
“The problem is, Your Honor, there are no seats,” Mr. Clifford replied.
He admitted that he had threatened to make Ms. DeCurtis's life hell, but said he knew personal details about her only because she had talked about them so loudly to her friends.

“But you have to realize some of your conduct is inappropriate?” the judge asked.
“Your Honor, it only becomes inappropriate when people themselves won't behave,” he said.
Mr. Clifford faced charges of misdemeanor assault, attempted petit larceny, harassment and disorderly conduct.
He admitted that he had cursed at a passenger, Nicholas Bender, who was talking on his cellphone, then slapped the hand of another passenger, Lydia Klein, as she tried to give her business card to Mr. Bender — but only after she slapped his hand first. The prosecutor said Mr. Clifford was trying to steal the information on the card, hence the larceny charge.

“He is not a white knight, he's Darth Vader,” said Mary Weisgerber, the prosecutor, in her closing argument.
But after it was all done, Judge Stephen acquitted Mr. Clifford of all charges. The judge said he had discounted most of the testimony against Mr. Clifford because all but one of the witnesses had “an ax to grind.”
“While the court does not condone the defendant's manner of getting people to remain quiet or silent on the Long Island Rail Road,” Judge Stephen said, “I see no crimes having been committed beyond a reasonable doubt.”
Railroad officials said they were disappointed. “Some of our customers feel as if they have been abused by Mr. Clifford's behavior,” said Joe Calderone, a spokesman for the railroad. “We will not tolerate aggressive behavior by Mr. Clifford if he seeks to impose his own standards of conduct on others. We will not hesitate in the future to call on police if necessary to protect the safety of our customers and employees.”
As Mr. Clifford left the courtroom and stepped outside to light a celebratory cigar, he pronounced the judge “excellent” and even complimented the prosecutor for finding one neutral witness.
On Tuesday evening, he took the A train to the Grant Avenue-Pitkin Avenue station in Brooklyn, where he picked up his car for the drive home to Long Beach — not because he was afraid to take the commuter railroad, but because the subway was more convenient, he said. He celebrated at Shines bar.
“Believe me,” Mr. Clifford said, “I am no hero. Rosa Parks is a hero. I'm just a knucklehead.”
Scientists with the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Illinois, home of the Tevatron particle accelerator, say their ageing machine now stands at least a 50% chance of spotting the elusive Higgs boson by the end of next year.
The estimate is based on the accelerator's efficiency at producing high energy particle collisions, now running at an all-time high, and the chances that the Higgs' mass falls within a range detectable at Fermilab.
With CERN's malfunctioning Large Hadron Collider (LHC) more than six months away from restarting, and another year or more from releasing data, it looks increasingly likely that the Tevatron will have a clear run at being the first to spot the Higgs.
Not a race?
“We're not racing CERN,” says Fermilab director, Pier Oddone, who points out that many physicists working at the Tevatron are also heavily involved with the LHC. However, other scientists at Fermilab told New Scientist that the sense of competition is real, and that researchers are “working their tails off” analysing data from the Tevatron's two key particle experiments, named CDF and DZero.

“Indirectly, we're helping them,” says DZero spokesman Dmitri Denisov of his European counterparts. “They're definitely feeling the heat and working a little harder.”
Past experiments and theoretical models predict that the Higgs boson, widely thought to be the last undiscovered particle, in the so-called Standard Model of particle physics has a mass that is equivalent to a value between 114 and 184 GeV (billion electron Volts). This range falls within Tevatron's sensitivity, which suggests that if the Higgs is real, it will only be a matter of time before it turns up at Fermilab.
Growing possibility
But that window inside which the Higgs could exist is shrinking, in a way that favours the Tevatron.
Last summer data released by both CDF and DZero effectively excluded a value of 170 GeV, where a Higgs boson would stand out particularly well against the background noise of other particle interactions. Data gathered since then is continuing to expand the possibility for detections on either side of this value.
That means the closer the Higgs mass is to 170 GeV, the greater the chances are that it will be seen first at Fermilab.
Denisov estimates that evidence for a 150 GeV Higgs boson could emerge as early as this summer, well before the LHC is even projected to restart after it was damaged last year. Alternatively, if the Higgs mass is 120 GeV, it would likely be the end of 2010 before scientists at the Tevatron were confident enough to report a detection.
Clear signal
One thing that will aid physicists is the fact that the Tevatron collides protons with anti-protons. The resulting collisions create less background noise than the proton-proton collisions at LHC are expected to produce.
“We couldn't be in a better position,” says Jacobo Konigsberg, a physicist at the University of Florida, Gainesville, who is co-spokesman for the CDF experiment. “The Tevatron is working beautifully and in the next two years we could double the data taken during the last eight.”
It's officially called as the Annual Player Seletion Meeting, but fans, the media and the league call it the NFL Draft. And this week, both ESPN and NFL will provide full coverage for three days starting this Thursday, April 28 through Saturday, April 30. One of the biggest bones of contention in the past was that they would “spoil” picks ahead of time, removing the drama for viewers. Even with the pick tipping, the Draft was one of the most-viewed events of the spring for both networks.
But going into the 2016 Player Selection Meeting in Chicago, but networks say they will again not tip picks via their social media accounts or on TV to assuage viewers. ESPN's producers tell SI.com that its policy will remain in place unless there's a major trade between teams or breaking news.
NFL Network says it won't tip picks on at least the first two nights of the Draft and will keep the suspense for fans throughout its coverage.
The whole idea of tipping or “spoiling” picks has been a question for networks and their insiders for years. While reporting the news as it breaks has been number one for insiders who have been trained to break once they receive the information, viewers who watch the draft and monitor social media at the same time do not like being informed ahead of time. Their complaints have been heard by the networks and ESPN's NFL coordinating producer Seth Markman tells SI that it's all about the viewers and making their experience as satisfactory as possible:
“For us it is the simple philosophy of listening to our viewers,” Markman said. “I have seen the criticism from some critics or other reporters (who say that withholding information goes against the primary tenet of journalism) but as I have said in the past, every time we have done research on this it has been an absolute landslide that our viewers have asked to watch the show and not have any of our talent spoil the experience.”
So ESPN's Adam Schefter and NFL Network's insiders won't be spoiling anything for fans who want to know who their team will be selecting. It's all part of keeping fans interested so unless they follow other NFL reporters who aren't following this tenet, they should be able to watch spoiler-free.

Two troubled souls in Florida – Greg Cimeno and William Filene — decided that it would be “fucking hilarious” to dress up as George Zimmerman and a murdered Trayvon Martin for Halloween. Filene donned a hoodie with blood painted in the center and put on black face paint. His friend Greg put on a T-shirt that said “neighborhood watch.” In the picture that Caitlin Cimeno put up on Facebook, the two men smile and laugh for the camera with Caitlin standing in the middle having a blast.
An innocent teenage boy was murdered and these poor excuses for human beings find it reasonable to use his body as the ground upon which to stage their Halloween fun.

(The actress Julianne Hough also sparked outrage this weekend when she attended a Halloween party in blackface as the character Crazy Eyes from the show "Orange Is The New Black.")
I don't know how much more direct I can be in saying this: Do not wear blackface for Halloween. (Or brownface or yellowface or redface) It's that simple. To do so is utterly and incontestably racist and needlessly insensitive.
And yes, I used a command. Don't do it. This is not a question about rights. Human beings have every right to do completely effed up things. But who in their right mind wants to argue for the right to be racist, the right to make a mockery of human life, the right to be an asshole?
Blackface minstrelsy emerged as a form of mass popular entertainment in this country in the 1830s. Scholars like Benjamin Reiss and others who write about it suggest that white performers donning blackface to perform for white audiences allowed white people to work out their cultural anxieties and prejudices about race, racism, whiteness and blackness.
When white folks paint their bodies black, they demonstrate that they see the black body as a permissive site for the expression of trauma, pain and illicit pleasures. In other words, being in a black body permits them to do everything they are uncomfortable doing in a white body: being lewd and crude, celebrating violence, acting sexually promiscuous, using racial slurs.
This is just one more lie of white racism: that black people are free to do all the things our society hates and demonizes while white people are bound by the strictures of respectability. White pathologization of the black body is classic psychological projection. Everything that there is to abhor about whiteness and white supremacy gets projected onto the black body and becomes a material problem for black people.

Now for many people who simply do not want to concede the horror and racism of these acts by Filene and the Cimenos, it would be easy to dismiss this as individual racism, to suggest that these people are clearly jerks, but that their sentiments are not generalizable.
Every year, pictures surface on social media of college kids and regular citizens donning blackface for parties. This is not an isolated incident. It keeps happening and it happens because white people do not actually believe this constitutes an injury to black people. Or maybe they just don't care.
“We're just having fun,” many of them say. Look, I get the cultural fascination with black skin. The American national imaginary is built on the mythic lore of black otherness – superhuman strength to supply the main labor force of the national economy, men and women with extraordinary sexual desire and prowess, unparalleled athleticism, and a deep anger that leads to a fearsome capacity for violence.
Notice that I said myth. I understand that white folks without access to good anti-racist education might attempt to understand this group of people who are continually subject to the machinations of white supremacy by trying their damnedest to understand what it feels like to be black.
Advertisement:
My suggestion to those people: Just stop. The whole point of white supremacy beyond having a global monopoly on power and domination is that white people are never supposed to feel their race.
In fact, that is my question: How does it feel to be white?
How does it feel to move through the world without being accused, for instance, of “shopping while black”? How does it feel to know police officers are there to help you rather than surveil you? How does it feel to have the full range of your experiences represented on the big and small screen? How does it feel to be the dominant race in the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, almost all 50 governorships, every state legislature in the country and most cities and local governments too?
Advertisement:
I imagine that that feels good. Safe. I'm not asking for a perverse descent into white guilt here. I am asking white people to recognize that that goodness and innate comfort that you feel in your own skin, that uncompromised sense of your own humanity is exactly how you are supposed to feel.
I am asking you to recognize that black people and brown and native people are supposed to feel any way other than that.
When you grapple with how it feels to be white, you will be much closer to understanding how it feels to be black.

There may be no redemption for these foolish racists who clearly have no moral compass. Caitlin Cimeno is no innocent bystander herself. On her Facebook page, she mocked a picture of a little black girl in a T-shirt that said, “Black Girls Rock.” Caitlin intimated that if she “told the truth” using the converse logic that “white girls rock” she'd be called racist. I won't spend time explaining that any more than I spend time explaining why we don't have white entertainment television and white history month.
White people are not that obtuse. And the ones who are are willfully ignorant.
Ain't nobody got time for that. Instead, for those folks who consider themselves enlightened, I will simply say that one of the easiest ways to not be racist this Halloween season is to say no to blackface and tell your less enlightened friends to say no, too.
Black America and the diasporic black world thank you.
According to a new study, all Ashkenazi Jews are basically cousins. More specifically, Ashkenazi Jews are at least 30th cousins. LiveScience reports on the international team's new study, which found that “the central and eastern European Jewish population, known as Ashkenazi Jews, from whom most American Jews are descended, started from a founding population of about 350 people between 600 and 800 years ago.”
According to Columbia University researcher Itsik Pe'er, who was involved with the study, their research also showed that the group of 350 was made up of Jews of Middle Eastern and European—thereby disproving the much-debated theory that Jews descended from Khazars, a Turkic people who lived in the Caucasus region between the 7th and 10th centuries.
Here's how the study was performed, according to LiveScience:
The team analyzed the genomes of 128 Ashkenazi Jews, comparing them with a reference group of 26 Flemish people from Belgium. From that the researchers were able to work out which genetic markers in the genome are unique to Ashkenazi. The number of similarities within the genomes allowed the scientists to compute a rough estimate of the founding population and put upper and lower limits on the amount of time that had passed since that group originated. In this case it is 30 to 32 generations, or at most 800 years. “[Among Ashkenazi Jews] everyone is a 30th cousin,” Pe'er said. “They have a stretch of the genome that is identical.”
The discovery holds perhaps the most significance for doctors and Jewish patients. Just last week a new study revealed that all Ashkenazic women, even those without any family history of cancer, may carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer. The more genetic information available regarding Ashkenazi Jews, the fewer genome sequences doctors need to test and analyze when looking for potential problems or mutations.
This is pretty big stuff. Now go call your cousin.

Long time no see. This past week my laptop finally croaked. I ended up losing all my files and most of my anime. I also completely missed the wave of finales these past few days, so now I've got some major catching up to do. Go me.
Anyways, all that's settled now so I can finally get back to finishing this thing. Here's the next installment in the Celebrating 50 Years of Anime series of posts. This time we have the people behind the music, some big name animators, some bigger name mechanical designers, and perhaps the biggest name of them all.
#25. The Music
From the beginning, I planned to open this list not only to directors, but for all visionaries that contributed to the anime art form. Suffices to say, music is an integral part of anime we love and the position of “music composer” is an important one for any production team. Over the years, I've had the fortune and privilege of seeing (and hearing) some amazing anime and musical scores. So, in lieu of reaching the half-way point on this list, here's a section dedicated entirely to the people behind the music.
Several of my favorite anime music composers include:
Susumu Hirasawa (Detonator Orgun, Berserk, Millennium Actress, Paranoia Agent, Paprika)
(Detonator Orgun, Berserk, Millennium Actress, Paranoia Agent, Paprika) Yoko Kanno (Macross Plus, Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex)
(Macross Plus, Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) Masamichi Amano (Battle Royale, Miyuki, Maetel Legend, Giant Robo feat. Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra)
(Battle Royale, Miyuki, Maetel Legend, Giant Robo feat. Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra) Toshio Masuda (Excel Saga, Jubei-chan, Now and Then Here and There, Naruto (original), Mushishi, Ghost Hunt)
(Excel Saga, Jubei-chan, Now and Then Here and There, Naruto (original), Mushishi, Ghost Hunt) The Pillows (FLCL, BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad, Moonlight Mile)
And much, much more!
#24. Mitsuo Iso (1966?—)
Notable Works:
Director: RahXephon (2002, episode 15), Dennou Coil (2007)
RahXephon (2002, episode 15), Dennou Coil (2007) Animator: Ghost in the Shell (1995), Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), End of Evangelion (1997), Perfect Blue (1998), Blood: The Last Vampire (2000), FLCL (2000), RahXephon (2002)
History:
Mitsuo Iso is the only person so far that I'm unable to find a birth date for. Either I'm not looking hard enough, or this is the first time the internet has failed me (it's probably the former). If I had to make an estimate, I'd say mid 60s to early 70s. This would essentially make him contemporaries with the likes of Tetsuya Nishio, Hiroyuki Imaishi, and Shinya Ohira, all big name “new age” animators. He began his career working on several Gundam installments including 0080 and Char's Counterattack. He later worked with GAINAX on End of Evangelion where he animated parts of the memorable battle between Asuka's Unit 02 and the mass-produced Evas. His other major contribution during the 90s involved animating the first half of the final battle between Major Kusenagi and the “Spider Tank” in Oshii's Ghost in the Shell. It wasn't until 2002 when he finally made his directorial debut in RahXephon episode 15. His most recent work was the 2007 series Dennou Coil, an original creation, written and directed by Iso himself.
Personal Favorite: RahXephon
RahXephon was one of the first anime shows I had ever seen, so naturally I am partial. I actually saw RahXephon before Evangelion, which worked out rather nicely in the long run since the former never seemed like a show meant to be dissected. If Evangelion was the social commentary, RahXephon was the love song. Pure brilliance from start to finish. It's backdrop is frequently laden with pre-Columbian and Mesoamerican imagery. It draws many structural influences from those old Kaiju stories. The mechanical designs for the RahXephon heavily resembles that of Raideen. Yet behind all the mythical mechas, secret factions, Evangelion-esque exposition, religious symbolism, and intricate characterizations, there lies the love song. RahXephon, at its core, is a love story.
RahXephon was not directed by Iso, however. It was a joint creation by directors Yutaka Izubuchi, Tomoki Kyoda, and the newly established Studio BONES. Iso was in charge of digital work and after-effects. He had little to do with the actual story. In fact, of all the screenwriters who contributed to the show (which included the likes of Yoji Enokido and Chiaki Konaka), Iso only wrote one episode. But here's the thing. He not only wrote it, he also directed, storyboarded, and animated the entire episode by himself (with minimal assistance). An entire episode entrusted and subjected to one person's vision, direction, and talents. This process has become known as Sakuga animation and it was Iso's moment in the spotlight.
Legacy:
I was originally not a very huge fan of CG. Even now, I'm still not that fond of it. However, if there's one man that'll make me eat my own words, it's Mitsuo Iso. After seeing his work and reading his interviews, I realized that this was a man who knows his priorities and is not about to let the industry's standards and norms affect his end product. As an animator, he is one of the best. A pioneer of “new realism” that I can personally get behind. His style was unique in that it featured “full 3-frame” cell animation without in-betweens, more-or-less challenging the industry standard set by Yoshinori Kanada years ago. After working on RahXephon, Iso was asked what plans he had for the future. He said he had no real intention of becoming a director or scriptwriter. Five years later, the highly anticipated Dennou Coil was finally completed after nearly 10 years of production. Well-played Iso, well-played.
#23. Masaaki Yuasa (1965—)
Notable Works:
Director: Vampiyan Kids (1999, pilot), Mind Game (2004), Kemonozume (2006), Kaiba (2008), The Tatami Galaxy (2010)
Vampiyan Kids (1999, pilot), Mind Game (2004), Kemonozume (2006), Kaiba (2008), The Tatami Galaxy (2010) Animator: Crayon Shin-chan (1992), Noiseman Sound Insect (1997)
History:
Masaaki Yuasa rose to prominence during the 90s animating for Crayon Shin-chan. Those who saw the original series were granted a glimpse of Yuasa's genius though his unique style of movement and character designs. He would take his style and apply them to later projects including Shinya Ohira's Hakkenden OVA. In 2004, he made his official directorial debut in the Studio 4c movie Mind Game. To this day, Mind Game remains my favorite movie from Studio 4c. He would later become involved with Studio Madhouse, directing a string of TV shows throughout the latter half of the 00s. In 2006, he directed the TV series Kemonozume which also featured the talents of the up-and-coming Kenji Nakamura. In 2008, he directed Kaiba. His latest work is 2010's The Tatami Galaxy.
Personal Favorite: The Tatami Galaxy
The Tatami Galaxy is a show that caught me completely by surprise. I had known from people talking about it that it was good, but it wasn't until I had finally seen the show for myself that I realized it was damn good. Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei (or The Tatami Galaxy) is very much a self-contemplative work. It aired during the latter half of the noitaminA programming block during the spring 2010 season. The show as whole captivates everything that noitaminA stands for: quality and aesthetic entertainment for the older audience. The Tatami Galaxy is pure genius in both narrative and artistic style. The cyclical story and captivating atmosphere paints each character in multiple facets. The narrative is purposefully fast, witty, and disjointed, a stark deviation from almost all of its contemporaries. The show as a whole acts a beacon of hope for quality animation in the future. The Tatami Galaxy is one that is not to be missed.
Legacy:
Talk about unique. Here's a man whose “wild free form” and no-bounds style of animation puts Hideaki Anno to shame. Masaaki Yuasa has made some “trippy” things in the past. Mind Game, in particular, begs the question: what exact combination of hallucinogens were in effect that led Studio 4c to make such a thing? All jokes aside, Yuasa is perhaps one of the most focused, determined, and critical visionaries in anime today. He is a man driven to tell his story in his own way. His directorial debut was a masterpiece no matter how you look at it. Mind Game would become a huge influence in much of Yuasa's later works including Kaiba and The Tatami Galaxy. If I were Madhouse right about now, I would try VERY hard to get this man on board for future projects. But truth be told, Yuasa has always been a freelancer, a rebel not about to let any one place tie him down for too long. Perhaps it's better that way. He's an artist, in every sense of the word. The anime industry could use more like him.
#22. Shinji Aramaki (1960—)
Notable Works:
Director: Megazone 23 (1985), Metal Skin Panic (1988), Genesis Survivor Gaiarth (1992), Appleseed (2004), Appleseed EX Machina (2007), Space Pirate Captain Harlock (2012?)
Megazone 23 (1985), Metal Skin Panic (1988), Genesis Survivor Gaiarth (1992), Appleseed (2004), Appleseed EX Machina (2007), Space Pirate Captain Harlock (2012?) Mechanical Designs: Genesis Climber MOSPEADA (1983), MASK (1985), Megazone 23 (1985), Bubblegum Crisis (1987),
History:
Shinji Aramaki is one of anime's most prolific mechanical designers. His designs ranged from the powered exo-skeletons seen in Bubblegum Crisis to the transforming robots in Genesis Climber MOSPEADA. His signature niche (or at least the thing I recognize most about him) is the transforming motorcycle. We see this many times including in the 1985 OVA Megazone 23, which he co-directed, and the 1987 OVA Bubblegum Crisis. More recently, he has headed a number of CG anime projects including Appleseed, Appleseed Ex Machina and a segment of the Halo Legends anthology.
Personal Favorite: Bubblegum Crisis
Robots, powered exoskeletons, science fiction, transforming bikes, mechs, cyberpunk, bladerunner, and 80s women, otherwise known as Bubblegum Crisis. This entire OVA is pretty much an amalgamation of everything I love about anime. I make this comparison often and I'll make it again: since we still don't have a decent Appleseed adaptation, I've always thought of Bubblegum Crisis as the next best thing. Out of all the mechanical designs that Aramaki has been involved with, I think Bubblegum Crisis has the best variety. Everyone seems to remember Priss's blue hard suit and transforming motorcycle, which I'll admit is pretty freaking awesome. However, my personal favorite power suit from Bubblegum Crisis has got to be Linna's green hard suit (ribbon cutters and explosive knuckle bombers, do want).
Legacy:
Shinji Aramaki did for power suits and transforming bikes what Shoji Kawamori did for jets and variable fighters. How many times have you seen Priss's iconic transforming power suit? or Shogo's Garland? I'd go as far as putting them at the same level as Kaneda's bike from Akira. Even Shirow's Landmate designs, he took in their original form and made them his own in the Appleseed movies. These images have become ingrained within anime itself and so has the name Shinji Aramaki. True, his pedigree for directing movies isn't the best and I'm not a huge fan of the full CGI as of late (Appleseed and Ex Machina), but I do enjoy his action-packed style of storytelling. He brings these awesome mechs and makes them move and come to life. He did it with the Veritechs, he did it with the Landmates, let's see if he can do it once again with the Arcadia.
#21. Hayao Miyazaki (1941—)
Notable Works:
Director: Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro (1979), Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992), Mononoke-hime (1997), Spirited Away (2001)
History:
Who is Hayao Miyazaki? Hmm… just some director who made a couple of movies. Oh and one of them won an oscar. Yeah that pretty much sums it up.
This man is one half of the driving force behind Studio Ghibli and the reason why a lot of us are anime fans. He and Takakata were trained by Yasuo Otsuka way back in the day when Toei and Tezuka's company were going head to head. Miyazaki began his career as an animator, and episode director for the Lupin III TV series. His first directorial work came in 1979. Miyazaki would collaborate with Otsuka on the memorable Lupin III movie Castle of Cagliostro. In 1984, he worked with Takahata on Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which eventually became the catalyst for the formation of Studio Ghibli. The rest, as they say, is history. Miyazaki would go on to become the single most recognizable figure in the anime industry, especially overseas in the United States. In 1997, Mononoke-hime became the highest grossing movie in Japan for that year. In 2002, Spirited Away became the first Japanese anime film to win an Academy Award.
Personal Favorite: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Nausicaa is also another movie I'm very partial to since I saw it early on and it has since become the one I've used to compare all subsequent Ghibli works. I have NOT read the manga, which I'm told features a more complete story than the movie. Still, I love the movie for what it is and to this day, no other movie by Miyazaki has been able to top it. I'm a believer that the 80s were truly anime's golden time. It was the age of Macross, the age of Gundam, the age of the OVA, the age of Royal Space Force, the age of Akira, and in the middle of it all, there was Miyazaki. There was Nausicaa.
Legacy:
Do I really need to spell out this man's legacy?

There are very few actors who can pull off the superhuman look: Vin Diesel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and possibly Bruce Willis, provided his chin doesn't disappear any further into his neck. However, only one action star actually behaves like a superhuman, and that's Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. If his recent escapades are any indication, he apparently crash landed on Earth in a space bassinet and is only just now discovering the extent of his alien abilities.
3 The Rock Is in Every Movie Being Made The Rock Is in Every Movie Being Made
The Rock has already been in six movies so far this year. On average, that's one movie every month, and that's more than Daniel Day-Lewis has been in for an entire decade (although in Daniel's defense, the Rock has a slightly different set of criteria in place for selecting his roles). If the Rock were an actual superhero, his power would be acting in movies, and his archnemesis would be Nicolas Cage.
Furthermore, for four of the past six months, at least one of the Rock's movies was in the top 10 at the box office. So he isn't just starring in whatever bullshit comes across his desk (see Nicolas "Bangkok Dangerous and Drive Angry" Cage, above). On top of all that, he's made a few wrestling appearances and is even hosting The Hero, a new reality competition on TNT where he oversees a group of contestants as they fail to match his athleticism.
"It's OK. You never really had a chance."

That would be a pretty full schedule for anyone, movie star or not, but the Rock is also preparing to star as Hercules in an upcoming film that will hopefully rival Schwarzenegger's Hercules in New York in terms of cinematic achievement.

ALBANY, N.Y. (NEWS10) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced they are filing an Amicus Brief to challenge North Carolina's discriminatory anti-transgender law.
According to the governor's office, New York and Washington are leading a coalition of 10 states and the District of Columbia in challenging the discriminatory North Carolina law that limits the ability of cities and localities to protect the rights of transgender and non-gender conforming people.
The coalition and two other states have filed a second court brief against Texas' challenge to the federal guidance allowing transgender students to sue facilities that go along with their gender identity.
"The kind of divisiveness and discrimination encouraged by this law directly undermine the core values of this nation," Governor Cuomo said. "Just as in New York, this country's strength is found in our diversity and inclusiveness. At a time when so many are seeking to create rifts that separate Americans from one another, it is our responsibility to fight back and do all we can to bring this nation closer together."
In March, Gov. Cuomo signed an executive order banning non-essential state travel to North Carolina.
New York is joined by nine other states in the brief including: Washington, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont, and the District of Columbia.
This coalition was also joined by New Hampshire and Delaware in filing a second friend-of-the-court brief.
New Delhi: Notwithstanding the recovery in job market, 58 per cent of India employers are finding it difficult to fill positions and there is a significant talent shortage in accounting and finance sector, a survey showed.
Globally, 38 per cent of employers faces talent shortage.
In India, however, the number stood at 58 per cent, ManpowerGroup's 10th annual Talent Shortage Survey said today.
Even though talent crunch persists for Indian companies, they are better off than last year. In 2014, 64 per cent of employers said they faced difficulty in finding the right people.
"The demand index for IT and accounting professionals have been on a continuous rise. Focus on technology upgradation and better financial access will drive the sectors growth in the coming months," said A G Rao managing director of ManpowerGroup India.
Employers in India are finding it most difficult to fill jobs in accounting and finance, IT staff, secretaries, receptionists, administrative assistants and office support.
"The demand for IT and related profiles is expected to go up further in the current year. Roles in analytics and mobile technologies will continue to be in demand," Mr Rao added.
The other jobs that are most in demand in India this year includes, teachers, engineers, communications staff, sales manager, executives, legal staff and researchers.
As per the survey, around 13 per cent of Indian employers said talent shortages are having a negative impact on their ability to meet client needs.
However, few employers are putting in place strategies to address the talent crunch problem, the survey added.
Globally, Japanese employers reported the highest talent shortages, as 83 per cent respondents are struggling to fill open jobs there, followed by Peru (68 per cent), Hong Kong (65 per cent), Brazil (61 per cent), Romania (61 per cent) and Greece (59 per cent).
At the other end of the scale, employers in Ireland (11 per cent), UK (14 per cent) and Spain (14 per cent) reported facing the least problems with talent shortages.
ManpowerGroup surveyed 41,748 employers in 42 countries during the first quarter of 2015 to explore the extent of talent shortages within the global labour market.
Egypt's highest-profile terror suspect is a puppet made of felt. No, really.
MUPPETS of the world unite! One of your brethren in Egypt has taken to TV in a fight to save her stuffing after being accused of being a secret terrorist agent.
In the midst of an Egypt-wide crackdown on dissent against the trouble-torn nation's military imposed government, Abla Fahita - a felt puppet - took to the airwaves yesterday to deny allegations that her appearance in a recent Vodafone commercial carried veiled bomb threats and coded messages to the banned Muslim Brotherhood movement.
The allegation highlight's a growing mood of paranoia in Egypt, with recent mass arrests following an ongoing series of bombings and violent protests.
"I am a comedic character," Fahita, said in a Skype interview with Egypt's CBC network.
In the allegedly illicit ad, Fahita chats on the phone about how to recover her late husband's SIM card, somehow lost at a shopping mall. She suggests using a sniffer dog.
The gossipy widow hand puppet was accused by a youth activist as using the sniffer-dog reference as a coded message to order an attack on a shopping complex.
The references don't end there, accuser "Ahmed Spider" asserts. A cactus-tree adorned with Christmas ornaments is a "clear" threat against Christianity, with its ornaments being symbols of "bombs".
He filed a complaint which was quickly passed to specialist terrorism prosecutors.
The Associated Press said it received an e-mail from Vodafone that called Spider's interpretation of the ad "mere imagination."
Nevertheless, the regional manager of Vodafone Egypt has been forced to front state security prosecution officers in order to explain the meaning of Abla Fahita.
The official investigation into the puppet has been widely mocked.
A Twitter stream, #FreeFahita has been created to battle for the comedic-character's cause.
But, a media release from the Egyptian Ministry Of Interior shows just how seriously the claims are being taken.
#Egypt has saved the world from a big terrorist threat not seen since the Muppets tried to take Manhattan #AblaFahita pic.twitter.com/SwAp9aoZe5 — Amro Ali (@_amroali) January 2, 2014
"The pages of Abla Fahita was using unknown symbols and codes whether secretly or publicly which is against the state's policy and what the law warned of. We do not know whether if these are true symbols or fake symbols in order to confuse the state's apparatus either ways it is against the law. The administrators of Abla Fahita should be questioned according to the law and we are waiting the prosecution's warrant to arrest those administrators and those who cooperated with them. FYI those administrators are well known to security."
The background to the impending case is no joke.
The Muslim Brotherhood opposition movement are supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. The group was last week banned as a terrorist group.
International concern has been growing the increasingly harsh crackdown on freedom of speech and dissent against the interim government which was installed after a popular uprising in mid 2013.

Rival European party leaders on Tuesday (27 May) gave centre-right Jean-Claude Juncker first shot at becoming the next European Commission president.
Socialist group leader Hannes Swoboda in a statement said the conference of presidents, a meeting of leaders of the European Parliament's political groups, back the former Luxembourg prime minister in order to start negotiations to seek a majority in the 751-seated assembly.
Described as a Brussels insider and a federalist, Juncker was chosen because he hails from the largest political group in the European Parliament, the centre-right EPP. Election results handed the party 213 seats, 23 ahead of its closest rival the centre-left S&D.
The announcement does not mean the major groups explicitly endorse him just yet. All say Juncker must come forward with policies they can endorse.
But it does mean that the European Council, composed of the EU's heads of state and government, can now either back or reject Juncker's nomination to replace current commission president Jose Manuel Barroso.
The Strasbourg assembly has over the months piled pressure on the European Council to select one of the MEP 'Spitzenkandidaten', noting that the Lisbon Treaty requires member states to "take into account" the elections.
But there is concern member states may instead put forward an entirely different candidate, raising the spectre of a future clash between the two institutions.
"We will insist as leaders of the group that only one who presented himself as a leading candidate in the campaign will get the support for being the president of the European Commission. No doubt on this," Green party leader Rebecca Harms told this website.
A parliament statement handed over to EU council chief Herman Van Rompuy ahead of Tuesday's informal dinner among heads of state in Brussels, references the treaty articles on the selection process.
For his part, German centre-left Martin Schulz and current EP president has not given up his bid to get Barroso's job.
Schulz said he is next in line should Juncker fail to muster up enough support from the assembly. Juncker must obtain the approval of at least 376 of the 751 MEPs, if formally endorsed by the Council.
"If Juncker will not get a mandate, the next one should get the mandate, that's me," he said.
But there could be complications.
Belgian Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt said the 376 margin in favour is not good enough.
Instead, his group intends to back the nominee who can guarantee a "stable majority" in the parliament.
"A stable majority means more than 400 without having to rely on political parties like those of (Hungarian PM) Orban or former Italian PM Berlusconi," he said.
The idea is to make it even more difficult for the incoming eurosceptics to derail legislation.
Nigel Farage's eurosceptic political group, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD), and the British Conservative European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) opposed Juncker's nomination.
The remaining groups, representing at least 561 members in the new legislature, backed him.

Recipes are great. But formulas are where it's at.
Recipes allow even brand-new cooks to produce something that's really good, or at least something that doesn't entirely suck. You can take a recipe that an expert chef created and reproduce in your home exactly the same dish, without the years of training. Score.
The problem with recipes, though, is that it's easy to rely on them too much, especially if you're like me and you're scared to mess with them. Eventually you find yourself stuck in a box, where you eat the same thing over and over and never venture beyond the safe comfort of your trusty recipes.
This was my problem with smoothies for a long time: I'd find a recipe for one I liked, make it every day for a month, and then get so sick of it that one day I'd simply revolt.
Skip the smoothie. Go to Starbucks. Coffee and a bagel. Not a good start to the day.
Eventually, I stepped back from the “month of smoothies, month of Starbucks” routine. I figured out what the smoothies I liked all had in common, and came up with the Perfect Smoothie Formula. This way I could switch in different ingredients and never run out of smoothie ideas or get sick of the same one over and over.
First smoothies, now energy bars
My wife and I had the same problem with my sister Christine's homemade energy bar recipe, part of the Sweet Tooth Friday series she used to write for No Meat Athlete before she got fired law school intervened. We used to make these energy bars all the time (and in bulk for bringing on road trips), and they've earned themselves more than a few fans among NMA readers too.
And if you remember Christine's Sweet Tooth Friday posts, you know that she's got a talent for sneaking beans and other seemingly-gross stuff into bars and desserts to make them really healthy and still taste good (remember black bean brownies?). Her energy bars are no different — delicious and wholesome, and even packing a decent amount of protein.
So it's a great recipe. But unfortunately, you can only eat the same energy bar so many times before it makes you want to ralph.
And so I asked Christine to take a break from law school to help me out. (I was thinking a whole semester, but she knocked it out in a day.)
This energy bar formula is what she created, and it's fantastic. In the basic recipe below, Christine lists the amounts of each type of ingredient. Then underneath that, she suggests several ingredients of each type, which you can mix and match to come up with your own energy bars (and feel free to try others). Finally, she gives a few examples of bars she's made, to give you a few ideas.
The Ultimate Energy Bar Formula
1-pound can of beans, drained and rinsed (or 1.5 cups cooked beans)
½ cup binder
¼ cup sweetener
¼ cup soft sweet fruit
1 teaspoon of extract (optional)
1 teaspoon of dry spice (optional)
¼ teaspoon sea salt
1.5 cups of oats (you can toast them if you want but I can't tell the difference)
1 cup dry base ingredient
1 cup stir-ins In a food processor, combine beans, binder, sweetener, soft fruit, extract, spice, and salt until smooth. Add the oats and dry base ingredients and pulse just to combine. Add stir-ins and pulse again just to combine. If the consistency seems spreadable, you're good. If it's too dry, add 1/4 cup of water; if it's too runny, add an additional 1/4 cup of the dry base ingredient. Grease 13×9 pan with baking spray or rub with 1 tablespoon oil, then spread mixture into pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes. Note: You'll have the most success if you use unsalted, unsweetened versions of the ingredients, and control the sweetness and saltiness through the sweetener and added salt.

So that's the basic formula! To help get you started, here are three variations Christine came up with. For each of them, follow the same procedure from above for mixing and baking.
Example #1: chocolate black bean happy bars
1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed (about 1.5 cups)
½ cup almond butter
¼ cup agave
¼ cup mashed banana
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon salt
1.5 cups of oats
1/2 cup cocoa + ½ cup brown rice flour
½ cup shredded coconut + ½ cup raisins
Example #2: cranberry-pistachio protein bars
1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
½ cup binder: ¼ cup of ground flax seed with ¼ cup water
¼ cup agave nectar
¼ cup applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon of cinnamon
¼ teaspoon salt
1.5 cups of oats
1 cup vanilla protein powder
½ cup pistachios + ½ cup dried cranberries
Example #3: maple pumpkin health bars
1 can of great northern beans, drained and rinsed
½ cup pureed pumpkin
½ cup maple syrup (Christine used more maple syrup in place of the sweet fruit here, for more maple flavor)
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
¼ teaspoon salt
1.5 cups of oats
1 cup spelt flour
1 cup raisin bran cereal
So there you go, three examples to get you started. But really, the point is for you to create your own, using the basic formula as the framework. So I hope you'll do that, and let us know what you come up with!
I'm excited about this formula idea … now we're trying to think of other things to come up with easy formulas for lots of varieties. Any requests?
[Update: NMA reader Andrew went the extra mile for us and put together a spreadsheet that calculates the nutritional information for any combination of ingredients you can come up with. You simply enter the nutritional information for each ingredient you use, as well as how much you used, and the spreadsheet spits out the numbers per serving. It even calculates the cost if you put that information in! Feel free to download the spreadsheet for your own use. Thanks Andrew!]
Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and the University of Copenhagen have discovered a new way to potentially ‘fence in' a tumour and help stop cancer cells spreading, according to a Cancer Research UK funded study published in EMBO Reports* today, (Thursday).
"This could be an exciting new way to harness the potential of the healthy tissue surrounding cancers to contain and restrain aggressive tumours." - Dr Erik Sahai
Tumours cause cells called fibroblasts to stiffen the surrounding tissue so that cancer cells can grip it– allowing them to tunnel through to the blood stream and spread around the body.
But the team showed that adding experimental drugs reprogrammed fibroblasts – stopping them from ‘stiffening' the tissue around tumours. This healthy tissue trapped the cancer cells, blocking their movement away from the tumour.
The team showed in mice that targeting fibroblasts reduced the movement of cancer cells from the tumour to the lungs and liver through the blood stream.
Co-lead author of the study, Dr Erik Sahai from the Francis Crick Institute said: “This could be an exciting new way to harness the potential of the healthy tissue surrounding cancers to contain and restrain aggressive tumours – stopping cancer cells from breaking away and moving to new places in the body.“
Lead author Dr Janine Erler from BRIC at the University of Copenhagen, said: “It's early days but a very promising new avenue of research. If further studies show this route can benefit patients, it could help crack one of the toughest challenges in cancer research – how to stop tumours spreading.
“As these fibroblasts are present in all solid tumours, our findings may be relevant to many different cancer types. Therapies similar to the one we tested are currently in clinical trials for anaemia and could feasibly be used to treat cancer patients.”
Nell Barrie, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK said: “Most deaths from cancer are caused when cancer cells travel to new sites in the body and grow as secondary tumours. And we know that it's not just cancer cells that play a part in this process – other cells in and around tumours are involved too.
“But the good news is research like this has the potential to uncover new ways to stop cancer in its tracks. Ultimately we hope these findings could lead to better ways to control the disease – and save more lives.”
The study was funded by Cancer Research UK, FEBS, Novo Nordisk Foundation, Danish Cancer Society, Danish Council for Independent Research, Innovation Fund Denmark and Wellcome-Trust.

Share. Benzies says the company tried to "force him out." Benzies says the company tried to "force him out."
UPDATE: Rockstar Games has provided the following statement to IGN:
“Leslie Benzies was a valued employee of our company for many years. Sadly, the events that culminated in his resignation ultimately stem from his significant performance and conduct issues. Despite our repeated efforts to address and resolve these issues amicably both before and after his departure, Leslie has chosen to take this route in an attempt to set aside contract terms to which he previously agreed on multiple occasions. His claims are entirely without merit and in many instances downright bizarre, and we are very confident this matter will be resolved in our favor. A core ethos since Rockstar's inception has been the concept of “the team”. It is deeply disappointing and simply wrong for Leslie to attempt to take personal credit for what has always been the tremendous efforts of the entire Rockstar team, who remain hard at work delivering the most immersive and engaging entertainment experiences we can for our fans.
"We do not intend to comment further on this matter.”
ORIGINAL STORY BELOW:
Leslie Benzies, former head of Rockstar North, developers of the Grand Theft Auto series, has accused Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar, and the Houser brothers of withholding royalties.
Benzies left Rockstar North in January, after being on sabbatical from September 1, 2014. According to Polygon, Benzies is suing Take-Two Interactive for $150 million, saying the company tried to force him out after his time off.
Exit Theatre Mode
Here's the statement from Christopher Bakes, a partner at the Locke Lord law firm representing Benzies:
"While on sabbatical, Mr. Benzies discovered numerous deceptions on the part of Take-Two, Rockstar, Rockstar North Ltd, Sam Houser and Dan Houser, who sought to force him out of the company and terminate his portion of royalty payments based upon arbitrary actions by the company's royalty Allocation Committee, a committee that may or may not have actually ever met."
Benzies claims he tried to go back to work on April 1, 2015. However, according to GamesIndustry.biz, Bakes said "Mr. Benzies found himself unable to enter the Rockstar North office because his facilities access device had been deactivated." Once security let him inside, Benzies "was then ordered to leave by the Rockstar North office manager without reason."
So far, Take-Two has not commented on the situation. We'll update you when we know more.

Why chaos is brewing in Congress – and why John Boehner could lose his job… Boehner's problem with conservatives isn't ideology; it's tactics… The House GOP's Plan B (or Plan D) on the Iran deal… Trump vs. Carson – and Fiorina… Another day, another bad poll for Hillary… And CNN poll shows Trump still leading the national GOP race.
Why chaos is brewing in Congress – and why John Boehner could lose his job
Yesterday's House Republican chaos over what to do next on the Iran deal is a reminder how combustible the next month could be in Washington, especially as Congress must pass legislation to keep the government open after Sept. 30. And it's a reminder just how precarious Speaker John Boehner's position is right now with his conservative base. Indeed, you have the making for a perfect storm – a conservative electorate angry that President Obama is poised for another win, despite Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress; a 2016 race where the incentive is for the candidates to move to the right; and the Age of Trump where his central argument is: “Why is everyone so weak?” If you add those things up and throw in a fight over Planned Parenthood and abortion, then you get trouble. Big trouble. Remember, both Boehner and Mitch McConnell received loud boos at yesterday's “Stop the Iran Deal” rally.
Boehner's problem isn't ideology; it's tactics
Here is the irony about Boehner's predicament: He's with GOP conservatives on the ideology. He's against Planned Parenthood. He's against the Iran deal. He criticizes Obama at every opportunity (see his comments yesterday on the Syrian migrants). But Boehner's problem isn't ideology; it's tactics. House conservatives view Obama as someone who's willing to do whatever it takes to win – executive action, Dem Senate eliminating the filibuster for executive appointments – and they don't know why their leaders aren't doing everything they can do to beat him. And now you have the situation where House GOP leaders can no longer blame Harry Reid and Senate Democrats for their inability to stop Obama since Republicans have the majority in that chamber.
The House GOP's Plan B (or Plan D) on the Iran deal
Here is the dispatch by NBC's Luke Russert on the House GOP chaos over the Iran deal: Instead of simply voting on a resolution of disapproval which was the original plan, yesterday the House Republican leadership came under fire from conservatives, who said that the clock for when Congress received the Iran deal from the administration did not start. They said this would make the deal invalid and that they should fight… Conservatives believe that the administration has not been forthcoming enough regarding “side deals” made between Iran and the IAEA regarding inspections. They believe that because the Administration has NOT disclosed these deals, the formal submission process of the deal never began and thus the clock which points to Sept. 17 when the deal takes place – never did not start… The House will now hold a series of three votes instead of a simple resolution of disapproval as intended:
Vote 1 – A non-binding expression of the House saying that the administration wasn't forthcoming regarding the side deals. Probably Thursday.
Vote 2 – A vote on an actual bill that says the U.S. should NOT give Iran sanctions relief.
Vote 3 – A bill that calls members to vote on whether they APPROVE of the Iran deal (not DISAPPROVE as originally thought).
Trump vs. Carson – and Fiorina
It's not just Donald Trump versus the establishment anymore. In the last 24 hours, he's engaged in back-and-forths with the two non-traditional GOP candidates who have been building support throughout August with GOP primary voters – Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson. And both are getting nasty. After he appeared to insult Fiorina's looks in a Rolling Stone interview published late Wednesday (“Look at that face!”), Trump is now denying that his comments had anything to do with Fiorina's physical appearance. (“I'm talking about persona!” he insisted to Fox News this morning.) Fiorina, for her part, observed that the comment was due to her own boost in primary polls. Also yesterday, Carson said that the biggest difference between him and Trump is his faith. “I've realized where my success has come from and I don't in anyway deny my faith in God,” he told reporters in Anaheim, California. Trump shot back in an interview this morning with a variety of insults, calling Carson an “okay doctor” and taking aim at the former neurosurgeon's low-key demeanor.
Another day, another bad poll for Hillary
Quinnipiac today is out with a new poll showing Bernie Sanders now leading Hillary in Iowa, 41%-40%. A couple of caveats here: One, our NBC/Marist poll that came out Sunday showed Clinton up by 11 points, and other polling in the state has shown her up either by single digits or by 20 or more points. Two, the Q-poll was conducted partially during the long Labor Day weekend. But what is TRUE is the overall trajectory for Clinton numbers. Whether she's ahead or behind, her poll numbers have been going down – and that's why you've seen the Clinton campaign take the recent actions it has (more ads, Ellen, apologizing for the emails). Of course, today is a bad day for Hillary to have a bad poll, given that Biden is making a swing through New York and is appearing on Colbert tonight.
CNN poll: Trump still leads the national GOP race
There's another poll worth noting: Trump is leading in CNN's national poll at 32% – followed by Carson at 19%, Jeb Bush at 9%, Ted Cruz at 7%, and Mike Huckabee and Scott Walker at 5%.
Walker looks to jumpstart campaign
Per NBC's Shaquille Brewster, “Amid a backdrop of polls showing declining support, the GOP presidential candidate will head to Ronald Reagan's alma mater in Illinois on Thursday to discuss how he plans to ‘wreak some havoc on Washington,' promising his first day in office would be ‘one of the busiest the White House has seen in years.'” More: “‘We cannot expect those from Washington to fix Washington,' Walker will say at Eureka College, according to excerpts released by his campaign. ‘Some people think you can fix Washington by putting new so-called experts in the same old places.'”
OFF THE RACES: More polls!
Here's the latest Iowa poll from Quinnipiac University, showing Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in a statistical tie in the caucus state.
And here's the latest national poll from CNN/ORC, showing Trump at 32 percent support.
BIDEN: He's in Clinton Country today, notes POLITICO.
BUSH: The New York Times reviews his tax plan: “Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J. Trump's candidacy is having on the Republican field after he made similar proposals.”
And/but: The plan would add trillions to the deficit, notes the Washington Post.
CLINTON: The Washington Post looks at how her Iran speech Wednesday laid out a tougher worldview than Obama's.
JINDAL: He's promising to take on Donald Trump as an “unserious carnival act.”
O'MALLEY: From msnbc.com's Alex Seitz-Wald: “In a major victory for underdog Democratic presidential candidates Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders, two top officials with the Democratic National Committee publicly broke with the party Wednesday night, calling for changes to the debate process that the candidates have advocated.”
TRUMP: He says he was talking about Carly Fiorina's “persona” – not her looks – when he commented on “that face” in a new Rolling Stone magazine profile.
Here's the full Rolling Stone story.
WALKER: NBC's Shaq Brewster writes that Scott Walker is hoping to jumpstart his campaign with an appearance at Eureka College, the alma mater of Ronald Reagan.
CONGRESS: Revolt!
So here's what's going on with the Iran vote in Congress: “House GOP leaders were forced to delay and quickly rejigger their approach for voting on the deal after some Republicans rejected the initial plan. The House is now expected to vote this week on a series of three measures aimed at expressing their opposition to the nuclear deal and leaving the door open to a lawsuit against the White House on the issue.”
And from the AP: “Conservative House Republicans have embarked on an eleventh-hour political maneuver to derail the Iranian nuclear deal, saying they can't vote on it until the president coughs up copies of side deals Tehran negotiated with atomic inspectors.”
Also, there's no plan yet to avert a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding.

I can't count the number of times I have manipulated trees and graphs in my career as a software engineer. They are the kind of structure that crops up over and over again in your code, pretty much regardless of the kind of application you are working on. And along these tasks, something that I've had to do over and over again is to display such a tree, usually for debugging purposes. Here is what a simple implementation can look like:
class Node(val value: String, val children: List<Node> = emptyList()) fun displayGraph(roots: List<Node>, indent: String = "") { roots.forEach { println(indent + it.value) displayGraph(it.children, indent + " ") } }
The Node contains a payload and a list of children. The displayGraph() function simply displays the value of each current node and then calls itself recursively with an increased indentation. Here is an example of the output:
val node = Node("Root", listOf( Node("A", listOf( Node("A1"), Node("A2"), Node("A3")) ), Node("B", listOf( Node("B1"), Node("B2", listOf( Node("B21"), Node("B22")) ))) ) ) displayGraph(listOf(node))
Root A A1 A2 A3 B B1 B2 B21 B22
Down the rabbit hole
Now imagine that another part of your code is also manipulating graphs, and you'd like to display those as well. However, they are currently using their own data structure:
class Tree(val payload: Int, val leaves: List<Tree>)
Different payload type, different name, but same structure. Obviously, your code should be able to display this structure in a generic fashion, so you introduce an interface:
interface INode<T> { val children: List<INode<T>> val value: T }
You rewrite your displayGraph() implementation with that interface:
fun <T> displayGraph(roots: List<INode<T>>, indent: String = "") { roots.forEach { println(indent + it.value) displayGraph(it.children, indent + " ") } }
And you make your two types conform to that interface:
class Node(override val value: String, override val children: List<Node> = emptyList()) : INode<String> class Tree(val payload: Int, val leaves: List<Tree>) : INode<Int> { override val children: List<Tree> = leaves override val value: Int = payload }
And you can now pass either Node or Tree to your displayGraph() function:
val graph = listOf(Node("A", listOf( Node("A1"), Node("A2"))) ) displayGraph(graph) val tree = listOf(Tree(1, listOf( Tree(11), Tree(12))) ) displayGraph(tree)
Output:
A A1 A2 1 11 12
So we made a solid step toward making our code generic while avoiding duplication, but we're not going to stop here.
Imagine now that this Tree class doesn't belong to you (for example, it came from a library or some other portion of code that you can't modify). Therefore, you can't make it conform to your INode interface. How can you still reuse your code despite this limitation?
This brings us to the main takeaway of this post:
If you can't adapt your data structures to your algorithms, adapt your algorithms to your data structures.
Let's ask ourselves the following question: what would it take for displayGraph() to work if it can't make any assumption about the types it's working on? Because these types can come from areas we don't control, we can't assume anything about them. In other words, they are some T type, which we know nothing about.
Well, we can ask the caller to pass us functions to manipulate this type. Looking at the implementation of displayGraph() , all we need is two functions that will give us:
The children of a node.
The value contained in a node.
fun <T, U> displayGraphGeneric(roots: List<T>, children: (T) -> List<T>, value: (T) -> U, indent: String = "") { roots.forEach { println(indent + value(it)) displayGraphGeneric(children(it), children, value, indent + " ") } }
As promised, you can see that the code above is manipulating an unknown type T , and in order to do that, we use the functions passed in parameters. Notice also the arrival of a second type parameter U , which is used to define the type of the payload. As you might have noticed, Node has a payload of type String while Tree ‘s is Int . Therefore, we need a second type parameter to capture this flexibility.
How do we call this new generic function for our two types?
displayGraphGeneric(graph, Node::children, Node::value) displayGraphGeneric(tree, Tree::leaves, Tree::payload)
What if you sometimes want to display the graph on standard out and other times display it with the logger? You guessed it: you can make this generic by passing an additional closure.
Stepping back
So what did we do exactly through this exercise?
Functions need a contract in order to do their job. With the first approach, the contract is encoded in the type, which places a constraint on the kind of value you can pass to the function. In our second approach, the contract has been extracted from the type and passed on the side, as function parameters. This makes the syntax a bit more verbose but you gain a very important piece of functionality: the ability to apply functions to types even though they don't conform to a certain interface.
Does this characterization ring a bell? The concept you might be thinking of is “type class”.
In effect, we have just implemented our own version of a type class mechanism. If you are not familiar with type classes, you can think of them as a “family of types” in much the same way that a type is a “family of values”. It's just one step above on the abstraction ladder. Type classes look like interfaces except they can be defined after the types they apply to have been defined, just like we did with our Tree and Graph classes.
Our manual implementation shown above is actually a lot closer from a real type class implementation than you think. Compilers typically implement type classes by passing along invisible parameters commonly referred to as “dictionaries” that contain the information necessary for the compiler to generate the code that will connect the value to whatever it takes to make it conform to the expected interface. The only difference with our implementation above is that we passed these functions explicitly.
Notice also how this approach allows you to “adapt” types to obey a certain contract, and from that standpoint, it could qualify as the “Adapter” pattern, except that this time, it's implemented in a functional way instead of an object oriented way. The emphasis has moved away from the object and the class (which is unknown) and toward functions (which are clearly specified). Next time someone tells you design patterns don't exist in functional programming because they are not necessary, point them to this post.
Next time you are confronted with a problem where you'd like to reuse an existing generic algorithm, remember that you can implement your own type class mechanism as shown in this article.
BioLite's newest product is the NanoGrid, a lighting system that charges up using either the BioLite CampStove or the HomeStove. Both stoves use the heat from the flames inside to generate electricity. The battery for the system is in a sort of lamp/flashlight, called the PowerLight. Multiple SiteLights can connect into the PowerLight, though. The SiteLights are meant to be hung and come with ten-foot cords built in.
“One of the sparks that led to the birth of the NanoGrid happened on a research trip in India,” BioLite Director of Industrial Design Anton Ljunggren said in an email. “We visited a family who lived in a 2-room house. They only had one light, a tube light, but needed both rooms lit. The elegant solution they had come up with was to cut a whole in the wall and have half the tube light pierce through on each side.”
Ljunggren sent us that email from Uganda, where he was on another field research trip. “Our product design group splits their time equally between research and development for the two markets we work in,” he said. “We go camping to test and learn about user behaviors for the outdoor recreational market and we go to India and Subsaharan Africa to do user interviews for our customers here.”
Seeing the products being used, but also improvised solutions like the one in India, helps improve BioLite's design.
The NanoGrid is the first product to be offered by BioLite that is being sold in both the developing and industrialized parts of the world.

“The concept of the NanoGrid was based on our research in Subsaharan Africa and India,” Ljunggren wrote. “They both need wayfinding, portable light and a more permanent set up to light a home and create a sense of space. Having two similar use cases doesn't mean that the design drivers are all the same. But that's a positive challenge for the team as we have to work within the constraints of both users, one adding value to the other.”
After charging mobile phones, light has been the next most popular use for the extra electricity that BioLite's stoves generate. “As a company, we see ourselves as enablers of energy,” Ljunggren wrote. “Energy can be fire to cook, electricity to charge a phone or light to see. Since BioLite generates energy, it was a natural step for us to store and use that energy.”
The lights use something called edge-lighting, where the lighting surface evenly distributes the light. That way they don't make hot spots and they also use space more efficiently. A fully charged PowerLight can run two SiteLights for as much as 70 hours (depending on the brightness setting). It can also charge your phone along the way. The setup costs $99.95.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:
It took 11 years, but Judicial Watch recently received a response to a 2002 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request that revealed another major missed opportunity by the Clinton administration to prevent the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, which is part of perhaps the most catastrophic failure in the history of U.S. intelligence.
The new document reads like a Robert Ludlum spy novel, replete with exotic locales and sinister plots. Its pages explode with intricate twists and international intrigue. The villains are palpably evil; their plans, pernicious and deadly. But the good guys seemed largely oblivious to their machinations.
The chilling details come from the Defense Intelligence Agency, which finally handed over an intelligence information report titled “Letters Detailing Osama bin Laden and Terrorists' Plans to Hijack an Aircraft Flying Out of Frankfurt, Germany, in 2000.” The report is dated Sept. 27, 2001.
In early 2000, the documents informed America's top intelligence analysts that al Qaeda had devised a sophisticated plan to hijack a commercial airliner departing Frankfurt International Airport between March and August 2000. The terrorist team was to consist of an Arab, a Pakistani and a Chechen, and their targets were U.S. Airlines, Lufthansa and Air France. The document pieces together an intricate plot directed by a 40-year-old Saudi, Sheik Dzabir, from a prominent family with ties to the House of Saud. It revealed that al Qaeda had actually penetrated the consular section of the German Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, relying on a contact referred to as “Mrs. Wagner” to provide European Union visas for use in forged Pakistani passports for the terrorists.
These revelations came from an unidentified source that provided U.S. authorities with copies of Arabic letters containing precise information about the al Qaeda plot. It was all laid out in minute detail.
So, how did the Clinton administration respond? In the incriminating words of the intelligence information report, advanced warning of the plot “was disregarded because nobody believed that Osama bin Laden or the Taliban could carry out such an operation.” Perhaps that explains why, for 13 years, the report was classified “secret” and hidden from public view until Judicial Watch forced its release in August of this year.
The report revealed that al Qaeda, the Taliban and Chechen Islamic militants all had substantial operating support bases in Hamburg and Frankfurt, Germany. It included the name, address and telephone numbers of an al Qaeda passport forger in Hamburg for the Taliban and other Afghan terrorists and their support personnel during January and February 2000. The report showed that the terrorists had established a secure, reliable transport route to Chechnya from Pakistan and Afghanistan through Iran, Turkey and Azerbaijan. It also revealed that in January 2000, bin Laden and Taliban officials held a two-day hijack planning meeting in Kabul, Afghanistan.
In short, nearly two full years before the horrific attack on the World Trade Center, the international Islamic terrorist cabal revealed its insidious hand for all the world to see. The details of names, addresses and other information from this report should have provided “actionable intelligence” for any number of U.S. anti-terrorist operations. Instead, every scintilla of the information “was disregarded because nobody believed that Osama bin Laden or the Taliban could carry out such an operation.”
This isn't the first time the Clinton gang dropped the anti-terrorism ball. Judicial Watch previously obtained documents from the Department of State (“Terrorism/Osama bin Laden: Who's Chasing Whom?” showing that as far back as 1996, the Clinton administration knew of and ignored bin Laden's terrorist plans against the United States.
The New York Times, reporting on Judicial Watch's find in 2005, noted: “State Department analysts warned the Clinton administration in July 1996 that Osama bin Laden's move to Afghanistan would give him an even more dangerous haven as he sought to expand radical Islam “well beyond the Middle East,” but the government chose not to deter the move, newly declassified documents show.”
You can be sure the Clinton machine would prefer these revelations to go down the memory hole. But it is clear that both the failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attack and the Benghazi scandal can be added to the list of questions posed as that machine rolls on.

The now confirmed leaked and former FBI Director James Comey has a history of questionable behaviors on social media. At one point it was suggested he was behind a secret Reddit account and it's now confirmed he's operated an alternative account under a pseudonym on Twitter.
On Comey's account however he appears to be following a reporter from the Washington Post, which is the same reporter who first broke the fabricated “Russian Hacking” story. The narrative put in place by this claim provides no evidence whatsoever for the assertion however that hasn't prevented the alternative left media and propaganda outlets from continue to drive this fiction into the minds of their base.
They're so determined to attack President Trump at every turn that they've now become outlets of conspiracy theorists worse than the actual conspiracy theorists that the DNC and Hillary Clinton attacked during the campaign. Once prize winning publications now daily publish lies without insinuating at all that the actions are “alleged” and run them as if they're facts.
Last night, the infamous Washington Post began once again to publish a new narrative without any evidence to support their half baked claims. In an article they now claim unnamed ‘sources from around the Mueller investigation” are suggesting that President Trump is under investigation by Special Counsel for Obstruction of Justice.
Apparently there is no myth they won't publish. I wouldn't doubt if their ‘investigative journalists' read children's fairy tales all day without ever leaving the comfort of their office to pursue leads. They must enjoy role playing because the very role that they now play is to peddle nonsense and conspiracy theories.
The mainstream media is laughable at best and the Washington Post is a complete hack job of provocative lies. Such an outlet claims to be respected but exists to push propaganda versus being on the ground chasing the facts.
Certainly they would dispute these claims but in the minds of a large majority of Americans there lay zero trust whatsoever in the ranks of the ‘fake news media'.
Ellen Nakashima is one of four of these ‘reporters' who has a knack for James Comey. She was involved along with others on the newest piece of fiction this publication is pushing as fact to the general public.
The published work of combined fiction and opinions goes on to state “Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation. Officials say that changed shortly after Comey's firing.”
However the article is completely based upon the supposed leaks of anonymous sources. Such is the new basis for pushing propaganda in the mainstream media in America. You can literally claim that extraterrestrials abducted the President if you like because an ‘anonymous source' in the administration told you about it. While that's a bit far fetched it serves to exemplify the complete hate these outlets have for the President of the United States and the fact there is nothing they wouldn't stoop to committing in order to further their agendas.
Back in March Jones Comey admitted publicly he had a ‘secret' Twitter account. He stated he had very few followers. Within a matter of a few hours Gizmodo journalist Ashley Feinberg had tracked down accounts that appeared to belong to Comey. All of the accounts were using the pseudonym Reinhold Niebuhr.
Feinberg was able to find the Twitter account @projectexile7 which at the time was only following 27 people and had a single follower. Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare, of whom happens to be a close and personal friend of Comey. The account did not have any identifying information in the bio and the avatar was the stock twitter egg avi.
After Gizmodo's investigative work and publishing the report the account boomed instantly to gaining 7000 followers and was eventually locked down being set to private.
In Feinberg's extraordinary report she listed that Comey was in fact following several well known journalists via this account. All of those reporters were widely known to be pushing the Trump-Russia propaganda through their non-respected media outlets.
Included in the list of individuals Comey was following were Nakashima and David Ignatius, as well as Adam Goldman and David Sanger of the New York Times. Unsurprisingly to most Americans Nakashima is the individual who broke the Trump-Russia narrative and now is pushing the Obstruction of Justice fabrication without evidence.
At this point the American people have to realize that the FBI Director James Comey had an agenda the entire time. As of his actions on the campaign trail weren't obvious enough and now his admission of leaking stories to the Press isn't a testament to himself and his character one must ask why was this many leading the nation's most prominent law enforcement agency at all? He seemingly has alternative motives of some sort.
The Washington Post also needs to be held accountable. It's up to actual investigative journalists to call out their peers (which they have been doing) for their gross misrepresentation of facts. Nakashima has a history of such nonsense however. Remember she was the first to also push the narrative that Russian Hackers somehow wrote responsible for the DNC and to this day even Congressional members suggest this without any evidence.
Every time these publications make such claims it's the same tried and worn out agenda and endgame. They also use the same ‘anonymous sources told us' assertion. It's pathetic at best.
What's most certainly true is those who would have the skills to commit such acts or fulfill the assertions allegations despise the mainstream media and the Washington Post especially. I wholeheartedly doubt if someone were to leak important information they'd do it to such a shameful outlet in the future.

Phoenix - Brewers manager Ron Roenicke conceded Wednesday that left-handed reliever Tom Gorzelanny likely will open the season on the disabled list.
Gorzelanny had off-season shoulder surgery and has been brought along slowly in spring camp. He currently is throwing long toss off flat ground at 150 feet as he works on rebuilding strength in the shoulder.
But, with less than three weeks remaining before opening day, Gorzelanny will not have time to pitch enough bullpen sessions, then get enough innings during exhibition play to open on the active roster.
"He's still a ways away," said Roenicke. "It doesn't look real good unless something happens where he comes along really fast. I don't think it's going to be a lot (of season missed), as long as there are no setbacks. But we're pushing it maybe a little."
Gorzelanny said he has no discomfort in the shoulder and there is good range of motion but he still must rebuild strength before pitching in games.
"It's feeling pretty good," he said. "I can feel it getting stronger. That's what we're working on now."
Assuming Gorzelanny opens on the DL, it could impact the status of a couple of other lefty relievers, Wei-Chung Wang and Zach Duke. Wang is a Rule 5 draft pick who must be kept all season or offered back to Pittsburgh, which likely would want him back. Duke is trying to make the bullpen as a non-roster player.
"It's hard to talk about all these things because so much changes," said Roenicke. "We spend a lot of energy talking about stuff that we can wait to talk about."
Asked if he thought Pittsburgh would want Wang back after throwing the ball well for the most part this spring, Roenicke said, "It's hard to comment on what they're thinking. I'm sure they were hoping that because he was in rookie ball (in 2013) that nobody was going to pick him up and keep him the whole year. He's got a nice fastball, and he's young, so there's a lot of upside to him. His personality doesn't seem like (facing big-league hitters) is going to affect him."
Roenicke isn't ready to make it official yet but lefty Will Smith almost certainly will have a spot in the bullpen.
"The way he's throwing the ball, yeah," said Roenicke. "He looks really good. He probably commands the ball better than I thought (previously), down in the zone. I saw (video) clips of the highlights of the punch-outs but he really commands his fastball well."
Of the decisions the Brewers have to make with the aforementioned lefties, Roenicke said, "That's nice to have. And good ones. I don't want a leftie that are not good. They're good."
Gay theatre student who claimed he was beaten by homophobic thugs admits he got his injuries when he fell over (and WON'T face action for wasting police time)
WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT
Richard Kenned y, 18, was badly injured after leaving Preston nightclub
His teeth were dislodged, his face was swollen and he had bad knee injury
The student from Blackpool told police he was set upon by homophobes
He posted injury pictures on Facebook in post shared by 182,000 people
Police launched an appeal into the '3.30am attack' and called for witnesses
Then they found CCTV footage showing Kennedy falling over by himself
A drama student who became an internet sensation after claiming he was savagely beaten up for being gay has admitted he caused his injuries himself when he tripped on the pavement.
Richard Kennedy, 18, from Blackpool, told police he was set upon by a gang of homophobes when he left a gay nightclub in Preston, Lancashire, prompting officers to appeal for information about what they called a 'particularly nasty assault'.
He posted photographs on Facebook of his battered and bleeding face, dislodged teeth, and gaping knee wound, with the caption 'An example [of] why homophobia is wrong and it's disgusting that it's still around in 2014'. The post was shared by more than 182,000 well-wishers.
Drama student Richard Kennedy, 18, from Preston, Lancashire, said he had been beaten by homophobes
Kennedy put photos of his injuries online, saying his teeth bad been pushed back into his mouth in the 'attack' Leg wound: The teenager reported the 'attack' in Preston city centre to police, who launched an investigation
But today the teenager, who studies Contemporary Theatre and Performance at the University of Central Lancashire, admitted he made it all up.
After being shown CCTV of him tripping and falling, face-first, onto the pavement, Kennedy accepted that the 'utterly inhumane homophobic attack' he had talked about actually never happened.
This afternoon Lancashire Police, who carried out a 'detailed and thorough investigation' into the alleged attack two weeks ago, confirmed CCTV showed the teenager had not been attacked by anyone, and had simply hurt himself when he fell over.
But police said Kennedy will not face any action for wasting police time as they were convinced he actually believed he had been assaulted when he spoke to police.
Detective Inspector Paddy O'Neill said: 'We managed to recover some CCTV footage which shows the injured party falling face-first onto the pavement. We have showed him the CCTV and he now accepts his injuries were caused during the fall.
'Having had oversight of the investigation... I accept his report was made in good faith. '
'Savagely beaten': But student Richard Kennedy was later shown CCTV showing he simply fell over
He added: 'I am conscious that the initial reports into this incident will have been very upsetting for a number of people, and Preston city centre was portrayed in a very negative light.
'Thankfully, there was no homophobic assault or any other assault on this occasion.'
After the alleged 'attack' outside the Evoque nightclub shortly after 3.30am on 26 February, Kennedy told how he was knocked to the ground and stamped on with such ferocity, four of his teeth were dislodged.
He also said he struggled to walk after suffering injuries to both knees.
The student later angrily relived his 'ordeal' on Facebook, posting before and after pictures and lamenting how 'stupid' he had been to walk home alone in a post which quickly went viral.
He wrote: 'Here is my face after a homophobic attack: four of my teeth are gone, not fallen out but deep inside my gums and cheek... my face is swollen, both my knees are badly injured and I struggle to walk...
Kennedy won't be charged with wasting police time as he really believed he had been attacked, police said
'My whole face is constantly throbbing and I'm now on four tablets a day for pain and infection and may require surgery to sort out the damage.
'All of this and what was their motive? Because of my f****** sexuality.'
Police initially said Kennedy was left so disorientated by the attack, he could not recall exactly where he was assaulted.
It is believed he walked around Preston city centre in a confused and distressed state for some time before police were alerted by a passerby.
In an interview with his local paper, he said: 'I heard a group of men shouting homophobic abuse at me.
Student: Kennedy studies contemporary theatre and performance at the University of Central Lancashire
'The next thing I know I was punched in the back of the head. I was violently assaulted - all because of my sexuality.
'I was covered in blood and had my face stamped on, causing my teeth to go into my gums. I might need surgery to amend the damage done. It's absolutely disgraceful to violently attack someone because of who they are. '
Kennedy went on: 'From all of this, all I want is awareness...I want people to see what can happen if you are as stupid as me to be alone on a night out'.

[Update 2:45 p.m.: USADA's 202-page summary of its case is now live here.]
Armstrong officially dropped his fight against the USADA charges in late August, but maintains that he never used performance-enhancing drugs during what was one of the greatest professional careers in the history of cycling.
“The evidence shows beyond any doubt that the US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team ran the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,” USADA said in a statement today previewing the release.
The anti-doping agency sent its dossier on Armstrong and his old cycling team to the World Anti-Doping Agency and the international bodies that govern cycling and triathlon earlier today as part of what is known as its “reasoned decision” explaining why it decided to ban the famed cancer survivor from competition earlier this year and strip him of his record-setting seven Tour de France titles.
According to Travis Tygart, the man who led the doping investigation, USADA's file on Armstrong and his former pro team is several hundred pages thick and includes sworn testimony from more than two dozen people, including 11 of Armstrong's former teammates who the agency said have admitted to doping themselves and have suggested that Armstrong not only doped but encouraged his supporting cast to do the same. Among those former teammates named in the release are some of the biggest names in American pro cycling, including Levi Leiphimer and George Hincapie.
More from USADA:
The evidence also includes direct documentary evidence including financial payments, emails, scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use, possession and distribution of performance enhancing drugs by Lance Armstrong and confirm the disappointing truth about the deceptive activities of the USPS Team, a team that received tens of millions of American taxpayer dollars in funding. Together these different categories of eyewitness, documentary, first-hand, scientific, direct and circumstantial evidence reveal conclusive and undeniable proof that brings to the light of day for the first time this systemic, sustained and highly professionalized team-run doping conspiracy.
The full report, along with the what sanctions the agency is imposing on those cyclists who admitted doping, will be published on www.usada.org later today. [Update 2:45 p.m.: USADA's 202-page summary of its case is now live here.]
Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan (pictured) star in the new film, which had a budget of $55million
A cinema has said said it will not let any men in to watch the new Fifty Shades film until they 'see if women can control themselves'.
Fifty Shades Darker, which stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, was released in UK cinemas on Friday night and is the sequel to the first and hugely popular film.
But a message informing men that they could not come in to watch the film was recorded by a staff member at the Diamond Cinema in Navan, Ireland.
The message, which was played on its phone listings, stated: 'If you're looking to go to Fifty Shades Darker and you're bringing your boyfriend, you better keep lots of space between you.
'It's on an 18 cert and I must stress that single men or married men on their own, any unaccompanied males will not be allowed in.'
When speaking to the Irish Mirror, Paul Egan, who records the listings for the cinema, said he thought it was 'better to keep the single men outside' at first.
He said: 'It might be better to keep the men outside the door until we see if women can control themselves.
'The film is basically porn for women, going on what the distributors are describing to us.'
The film was given an 18 certificate and had a budget of $55million - or £44million - which was $15million more than the first movie.
Fifty Shades Darker (pictured) is the sequel to the original film and was released in UK cinemas on Friday night
On Thursday, the A-list actors descended upon London's Leicester Square for the UK premiere of the racy romance flick, the second in the big screen adaptations of E.L. James' bestselling erotic novels.
The first film was an immediate box office success and made a staggering $571million in sales.
Authorities believe victim may have fallen from bluff top along Del Playa Drive
A couple walking along the beach in Isla Vista early Saturday discovered a severely injured man who authorities believe may have fallen from the cliff top, according to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.
Firefighters were called to the scene at about 1:40 a.m., and found the victim bleeding from the mouth and with other serious injuries, according to Fire Department spokesman Russ Sechler.
Fire crews carried the man down the beach and back up to Del Playa Drive, where he was placed in a waiting AMR ambulance and taken to a local hospital, Sechler said.
Further details about the incident were not immediately available. Check back with Noozhawk for updates.

Yesterday afternoon my Cabinet endorsed a report to cover an increased spend for the MetroBus Scheme. I have to admit this is frustrating and disappointing at a time councils are facing such a challenging financial settlement from central government.
We inherited the MetroBus Scheme and overspend, as well as the disruption. Nevertheless, we've now got to continue and see this through.
I described the situation using a metaphor my wife's grandfather-in-law used: “you've got the tiger by the tail. You don't want to let go of the tiger because it will bite you, but you wouldn't want to have hold of its tail in the first place.”
Having spent the sum to date, we need to finalise the scheme despite these difficulties and make it work.
At Cabinet I was frustrated by some comments which suggested that this came at the expense of affordable homes. It is important elected members are explaining how Council budgets work and don't create false equivalencies.
Because of the way the project is funded by Central Government, you cannot simply take money off MetroBus and use it for affordable homes. Money has been granted by the Department for Transport specifically for it. Failing to deliver would not only put the cash in jeopardy, but would have a reputational impact for our city that would impede our ability to get more government money in the future, including money to build affordable housing.
What's far more important is that we need to look at transport with a more ambitious eye. We are working on a number of big ideas for transport as well as the urgent need to upgrade Bristol Temple Meads as the gateway for the city. There are a number of other ways to achieve these aims working with the Community Infrastructure Levy, private investment and central government finances.
Despite what a certain reputable but totally unnamed source would have you believe, picture-perfect blueberry pie is ridiculously easy to make. That's because blueberries aren't some mystery of the universe, filled with variables no man can account for; they're filled with water. Tasty water, to be sure, but water that can be accurately gauged thanks to something known as a scale.
Whether it's fresh or frozen (more on that here), a fruit's weight gives us a reliable indication of its water content, so we can easily predict how much starch is needed to form a gel and how much sugar is needed to protect that starch from thermal hydrolysis, a.k.a. overcooking. You can read up on the science behind my formula here, but in practice all you have to know is this: Whatever your fruit, you'll need 5.5% of its weight in tapioca starch and 25% of its weight in sugar, tossed in a crust, baked until bubbling-hot, and cooled to 85°F (29°C). With those rules, you can always count on a pie that's juicy yet beautifully thick, never runny or gloppy.
Truth be told, it doesn't matter whether you've got blueberries, cherries, or plums, because water is the only factor we need to account for when it comes to thickening a pie. But wait, you cry. What about pectin? Doesn't that, like, have something to do with pie?
Ehhh, not really. For the uninitiated, pectin is a soluble fiber found in many fruits, and when cooked it can help liquids to gel. It's only natural to imagine this natural thickener must play an important role in fruit pies, but pectin is a little fussy, willing to perform only under specific conditions. Aside from concentration, which varies from fruit to fruit, pectin requires just the right amount of sugar, acidity, and heat before it can really kick into gear.
According to my pal Cathy Barrow, author of Mrs. Wheelbarrow's Practical Pantry, pectin doesn't really do its thing until about 220°F (104°C). That's well above the internal temperature of any pie, significantly hampering pectin's power to gel. What's more, compared with jams and jellies, pie filling contains way less sugar and acid—two more factors that minimize pectin's role as a thickener.
So while it's true that blueberries contain a decent amount of pectin, it's of little use within the context of a low-sugar, low-acid, low-heat pie. Put simply, when it comes to blueberry pie, pectin is completely irrelevant. That means blueberry pie is dead easy to thicken, because there aren't any wild cards to consider.
Some bakers thicken their pies by cooking down the berries' juice to concentrate the flavor, but to me that makes for a jammy pie that's thick but also a little dry. Others prefer a pie so juicy it needs to be served with a spoon. My recipe offers the best of both worlds: a blueberry pie that's lusciously thick and easy to slice, but with all its natural juices intact. It also needs a crispy, flaky, golden crust on the top and bottom, without requiring any par-baking. Of course, that's not a feat any old recipe can achieve, but with my Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, you'll never have to worry about a soggy bottom crust again.
Whether you decide to go for a classic lattice pie or a fancy herringbone crust, don't let anyone tell you blueberry pie is a hit-or-miss proposition. I promise, it's a surefire thing.

Patrick Dangerfield and Joel Selwood at the Australian Awards night
STAR Richmond defender Alex Rance has been rewarded with the captaincy of the Virgin Australia AFL All Australian team after another brilliant season.
At the Palais Theatre on Wednesday night, Rance was picked in the side for the fourth-straight season.
A humbled Rance admitted to knowing in advance he had been awarded the honour, which came for the first time in his career.
"It's a bit embarrassing, to be totally honest. There are so many super players up here," Rance said.
"I found out pretty early on in the night because I had a look at my jacket and it had the 'C'.
"Standing in front of 'Buddy' Franklin, Josh Kennedy, Joel Selwood, these guys who are true champions of the game. I'm sort of just making up the numbers."
West Coast goalkicker Kennedy missed out on a third-straight Coleman Medal when Sydney superstar Lance Franklin pipped him in the last round but was rewarded with the vice-captaincy and the full-forward spot.
Three members of the 'Essendon 34' were named after missing all of last year: Michael Hurley, Melbourne's Michael Hibberd and Port Adelaide's Paddy Ryder.
Ryder won the battle of the big men in the South Australian teams, with Adelaide's Sam Jacobs edged out in a tight battle.
It's been a remarkable comeback for Hibberd, who missed the first month of 2017 with an Achilles complaint but has averaged 27 disposals since.
Injured Geelong captain Selwood was named on the interchange bench – his sixth time in the side.
Explosive Greater Western Sydney onballer Dylan Shiel, Adelaide hard nut Matt Crouch and versatile West Coast backman Elliot Yeo were also on the bench.
Selwood played just 18 games after requiring surgery for a left ankle syndesmosis injury late in the season and was concussed in the first minute of the round 14 wins against Fremantle.
Essendon big man Joe Daniher was named in a forward pocket, alongside Adelaide jet Eddie Betts.
Four-time Coleman medallist Franklin was named at centre-half forward, his seventh time in the team.
Dayne Zorko was one of a few shining lights for the 18th-placed Brisbane Lions and was picked on a half-forward flank, along with Port Adelaide's Robbie Gray.
Hawthorn ball-winner Tom Mitchell was rover in his first season since being traded from Sydney while reigning Brownlow medallist Patrick Dangerfield (Geelong) won a fifth berth.
Superstar Richmond onballer Dustin Martin was named in the centre, flanked by out-of-contract Greater Western Sydney midfielder Josh Kelly and Essendon's Zach Merrett on the wings.
Gun Adelaide backman Rory Laird won a spot in the team for the first time, after being named in the squad but missing out on the team for the past two years.
Carlton rebounder Sam Docherty became the first Blue since Chris Judd and Marc Murphy in 2011 to be selected in the side when he was named for the first time.
West Coast's Jeremy McGovern backed up his selection from last season with a place in the back pocket.
Diagram showing the site of injection of the product Vasalgel, a vasectomy alternative
Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG), formerly referred to as the synthetic polymer styrene maleic anhydride (SMA), is the development name of a male contraceptive injection developed at IIT Kharagpur in India by the team of Dr. Sujoy K. Guha. Phase III clinical trials are underway in India, slowed by insufficient volunteers.[1] It has been patented in India, China, Bangladesh, and the United States.[1] A method based on RISUG, Vasalgel, is currently under development in the US however there has been little or no progress in terms of bringing the product to market.[2]
Mechanism of action [ edit ]
RISUG works by an injection into the vas deferens, the vessel through which the sperm moves before ejaculation. RISUG is similar to vasectomy in that a local anesthetic is administered, an incision is made in the scrotum, and the vasa deferentia are injected with a polymer gel (rather than being cut and cauterized).[3] In a matter of minutes, the injection coats the walls of the vasa with a clear gel made of 60 mg of the copolymer styrene/maleic anhydride (SMA) with 120 µl of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. The copolymer is made by irradiation of the two monomers with a dose of 0.2 to 0.24 megarad for every 40 g of copolymer and a dose rate of 30 to 40 rad/s.[4] The source of irradiation is cobalt-60 gamma radiation.
The effect the chemical has on sperm is not completely understood. Originally it was thought that it lowered the pH of the environment enough to kill the sperm.[5] More recent research claims that this is not enough to explain the effect.
Professor S. K. Guha theorizes that the polymer surface has a negative and positive electric charge mosaic. Within an hour after placement the differential charge from the gel will rupture the sperm's cell membrane as it passes through the vas, deactivating it before it can exit from the body.[6]
Development [ edit ]
Sujoy K. Guha developed RISUG after years of developing other inventions. He originally wanted to create an artificial heart that could pump blood using a strong electrical pulse. Using the 13-chamber model of a cockroach heart, he designed a softer pumping mechanism that would theoretically be safe to use in humans. As India's population grew throughout the 1970s, Guha modified his heart pump design to create a water pump that could work off of differences in ionic charges between salt water and fresh water in water treatment facilities. This filtration system did not require electricity and could potentially help large groups of people have access to clean water. India however decided that the population problem would be better served by developing more effective contraception. So Guha again modified his design to work safely inside the body, specifically inside the male genitalia. The non-toxic polymer of RISUG also uses differences in the charges of the semen to rupture the sperm as it flows through the vas deferens.[7]
Intellectual property rights to RISUG in the United States were acquired between 2010–2012 by the Parsemus Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, which has branded it as Vasalgel.[8][9] Vasalgel, which has a slightly different formulation than RISUG, is currently undergoing successful animal trials in the United States. Initially, it was hoped that human trials would commence by the end of 2013 and become available to within a few years,[10] but the Parsemus Foundation has encountered delays, and human clinical trials have yet to be initiated.[11]
Advantages [ edit ]
Some of the advantages, according to Dr. Guha, are:
Effectiveness - There has been only one unplanned pregnancy among partners of the 250 volunteers who have been injected RISUG [ citation needed ] — apparently due to an improperly administered injection. Out of the 250 volunteers who have been injected RISUG, 15 received the injection more than 10 years ago.
- There has been only one unplanned pregnancy among partners of the 250 volunteers who have been injected RISUG — apparently due to an improperly administered injection. Out of the 250 volunteers who have been injected RISUG, 15 received the injection more than 10 years ago. Convenience - There is no interruption before the sexual act.
- There is no interruption before the sexual act. Cost - The shot itself costs less than the syringe used to administer it, and its long term effectiveness would make it theoretically only a four or five time cost, in the entire lifetime of someone who chose to continue to be on it.
- The shot itself costs less than the syringe used to administer it, and its long term effectiveness would make it theoretically only a four or five time cost, in the entire lifetime of someone who chose to continue to be on it. Outpatient procedure - Patients can leave the hospital immediately after an injection and resume their normal sex lives within a week.
Duration of effect - According to Dr. Guha, a single 60 mg injection can be effective for at least 10 years.
- According to Dr. Guha, a single 60 mg injection can be effective for at least 10 years. Reduced side effects - After testing RISUG on more than 250 volunteers, neither Guha nor other researchers in the field report have reported any adverse side effects other than a slight scrotal swelling in some men immediately following the injection which goes away after a few weeks. [12] Because semen, including inactive sperm, still exits the body following ejaculation, patients do not experience the pressure or granulomas that sometimes result after a vasectomy procedure. [3]
- After testing RISUG on more than 250 volunteers, neither Guha nor other researchers in the field report have reported any adverse side effects other than a slight scrotal swelling in some men immediately following the injection which goes away after a few weeks. Because semen, including inactive sperm, still exits the body following ejaculation, patients do not experience the pressure or granulomas that sometimes result after a vasectomy procedure. Reversibility - The contraceptive action appears to be completely reversible by flushing the vas deferens with an injection of dimethyl sulfoxide or sodium bicarbonate solution. (The sodium bicarbonate solution cannot be used as the solvent in the initial injection since it would neutralize the positive charge effect). Although this reversal procedure has been tried only on non-human primates, it has been repeatedly successful. Unlike in a vasectomy (see blood-testis barrier), the vas deferens is not completely blocked, the body does not have to absorb the blocked sperm, and sperm antibodies are not produced in large numbers, making successful reversal much more likely than with a vasovasostomy.[ citation needed ]
Potential hazards [ edit ]
The thoroughness of carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and toxicity testing in clinical trials has been questioned. In October 2002, India's Ministry of Health aborted the clinical trials due to reports of albumin in urine and scrotal swelling in Phase III trial participants.[13] Although the ICMR has reviewed and approved the toxicology data three times, WHO and Indian researchers say that the studies were not done according to recent international standards. Due to the lack of any evidence for adverse effects, trials were restarted in 2011.[7]
Smart RISUG [ edit ]
Smart RISUG is a newer version of the male contraception that was published in 2009. This polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name “Smart” RISUG. After injection the exact location of the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by X-ray and magnetic imaging. The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a pulsed magnetic field. With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has magnetoelastic behavior that allow it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration. With the original RISUG polymer, the SMA can possibly clump as a reaction to neighboring proteins.[citation needed] With the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. This makes Smart RISUG safer for the user as it will not accidentally block the vas deferens. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, is can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both acrosin and hyaluronidase enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile. The safety of Smart RISUG is still being investigated. With literature research, the spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. The albino rats used to develop the new polymer have not had any adverse symptoms.[14]
What a week for pro cycling. It's with a heavy heart that I weigh in on so many recent tragic events.
I actually had an entire column written for the boys at CyclingTips before the events of the past week changed everything, and put this all into perspective.
Of course I'm referring to the deaths of Antoine Demoitié, killed by race moto at Gent-Wevelgem, and Daan Myngheer, who died after a heart attack at Criterium International. And that's following the terrorist attacks in Brussels, just one day before Dwars door Vlaanderen. It's a lot to absorb.
Where to start? Let's begin with the most pressing issue of the day, race motorbikes, and work back from there.
I have been in the peloton for a long time now, and never have I seen so many incidents regarding race motos colliding with cyclists as I have in the last two or three seasons.
I have a few explanations for it, and I'll give my point of view.
When crashes happen in our sport because we are descending to catch the group in front, or battling for position in the final kilometres of a bunch sprint, then that is the cyclist's fault; that's something that comes with the risk and reward we accept as professional bike racers.
However, let's remember, the road is where we are racing. It's our “playing field.” We have enough problems dodging 179 other riders out there as well as traffic islands and roundabouts. The last thing we need to be worrying about is motorcycles, medical cars, VIP cars, and the like driving into us from behind.
Can you imagine a basketball game or a football match with the occasional moto screaming down the left side of the pitch? Okay, it's a bit of a stretch, but it feels this way sometimes. You can't hear them for the sounds of the road and bikes and wind. The next moment, you are on the deck, wondering what hit you.
I can count numerous times that I've been clipped but with no major stress. I probably screamed a little “THANK YOU.”
But take for example Stig Broeckx, who was hit by a medical motorbike at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne. That medical moto was doing over twice his speed, and it ended in a broken collarbone for poor Stig. We all saw the same images, and can draw our own conclusions. It could have been a hell of a lot worse. And then it happens.
With its windy route out to the coast, cobbled climbs and narrow roads, Gent-Wevelgem is a stressful fight for position at the best of times. Now we find ourselves fighting for position with motorbikes also. It's just not on — it's not cool.
I believe what happened with Antoine was an accident. I also believe we have nearly as many motorbikes on the circuit as we do cyclists, therefore making it an accident that could have been avoided.
Enough is enough. So what can we do?
This is where a governing body and the CPA must pull some weight. Limit the number of motorbikes — photographers, police, and television. Teach them the ins and outs of how a peloton rolls through the countryside, when they will swing left and right during a race.
I'm not saying all moto riders are the same, but let's have some kind of certification test.
Let's set a limit to the speed at which they can pass us. If we are doing 45kph and they are screaming past us at 100kph because they know that up ahead is a section of cobbles for a great photo, that is a huge impact that we are not going to win. Remember, it's our “playing field.”
I also believe we can show some respect back to the motos. Often when there is no stress during a certain point of the race I have yelled to my mates, “Left!” or “Moto!” so that they'll move over. Why not make it easy for them at certain points?
On that topic, when there is a massive rush for a turn because a crosswind section or narrow mountain entry is coming, the motos should not dare try to pass us. This is definitely not the moment to do this. We can't give an inch and are probably on our limits, physically and mentally.
We can learn and change from this. It has to happen. I'm not going list all the recent incidents, because they all pale in comparison to what happened to poor Antoine. It's an “accident” that should never have happened. And if we don't have some change and mutual respect, it'll happen again.
That's what I have to say on the topic, other than rest in peace, Antoine, and rest in peace, Daan. You're gone far too soon, and you will both be missed.
Extreme weather, and controversy at a monument
After Down Under, the first race back for me was Omloop Het Niuewsblad. I personally love this race, and this year was no exception. In my opinion, the good weather made the race a little easier than past editions, but having said that, the strongest still launched with 45-50km to go and couldn't be caught again. It's amazing; you know it's gonna go down up the Taiienberg, but there is just nothing you can do when they are riding away from you and you're already doing 700 watts.
It was a very popular win obviously for Belgium and Greg Van Avermaet is a clever as well as strong rider.
Peter Sagan was incredible as usual. Three weeks up at altitude, comes down the day before, and makes the final selection. No worries.
The next day we rode Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne. After speaking to a few of the boys, it seemed Kuurne was harder than Omloop this year – just a combination of extra wind and tired legs from the day before.
Again we saw an incredible ride from a young man, this time Jasper Stuyven, who is only 23. Riding that far solo — I can tell you it was super hard into the headwind as we were trying to haul him back to make a bunch of kick.
From there it is either Paris-Nice or Tirreno-Adriatico in prep for Milan-San Remo. I chose Paris-Nice this year — “the race to the sun.” It didn't disappoint. It was freezing cold the first few days, and we saw the UCI's Extreme Weather Protocol put to use. I was moaning a bit as to why they even started the stage that was ultimately canceled. We all knew it was snowing hard where we were headed. However, it was eventually stopped and there were a lot of smiles in the team cars after that.
The bunch sprints were not what I expected. I really wanted to see Marcel Kittel go head to head with Andre Greipel, but the first couple of days were so hard that neither made it. I think Greipel ran third one day, but again Kittel was absent and Greipel was without his usual duo of Marcel Sieberg and Greg Henderson.
However, the sprints were not without drama, with Nacer Bouhanni trying to throw the yellow jersey over the barriers in one final. He got his revenge the next day with a comfortable victory.
Michael Mathews is another one of those freaks of nature. First race of the season….victory. He held that yellow jersey for a while, but the GreenEdge boys were saying that he thought he could win Paris-Nice. Pretty bold statement, when you have Sky and Tinkoff ready to launch. But, hats off to him – a couple of wins and the green jersey for his first race of the season. I certainly am not doing that sort of behavior.
How exciting was the final Nice-Nice stage? I actually watched it when I got home, because I managed to finish Paris-Nice, which is no mean feat in itself.
You knew Contador was going to attack, and keep attacking he did. And on the Col d'Eze, when Geraint Thomas cracked, I thought that was it. But Thomas has a massive ability to suffer and he got together with Tony Gallopin and Sergio Henao, and they descended very quickly. They both know the descent like the backs of their hands, so they knew how fast to take every corner. You could see their entry and exit speed into the corners; that's where they were taking back time.
All in all, it was a great race. There were a few complaints about the gravel on the first stage, but at the end of the day, it was talked up way worse than it actually was.
I didn't see much of Tirreno, to be honest, and when you're tired from your day you pretty much check Twitter to see who won and that's it. Well, I do anyways.
Clicking through the news, you hear the Extreme Weather Protocol is going be implemented at Tirreno. Great. The night before, also. This is put in place not only to keep us, the riders, safe, but to bond us together. It lets the riders, as a group, have a voice and stand together.
And then the former Tour de France champion decides “You know what, I'm better than this Extreme Weather Protocol, and we should be racing. I don't care what the CPA has decided. Why should these rules apply to me?”
It's apparent in the peloton Nibali rides around thinking everyone should bow down to him. And his demonstration of cheating at the Vuelta shows us he thinks the rules don't apply to him. That's my opinion, and I'm not the only one who sees it this way.
On the subject of controversy, congratulations Ben Swift on being the rightful winner of Milan-San Remo.
Arnaud Démare, I'm sorry to say it, but you cheated in plain sight of many of your fellow competitors. Hanging on, up arguably the hardest of the climbs in the race, to make it back to the front, and then contesting the sprint is wrong — let alone then winning the sprint. This was not at a small 2.1 or 2.HC stage race, like Bouhanni did earlier in the season. This was a Monument. A life-changer in the world of cycling.
We have people witnessing him hanging on. We have Strava data that shows him freewheeling at 50kph or thereabouts. In my view, you took the risk of cheating and got caught.
The reason it irritates me so much is that Mathews got caught in the same crash and did an incredible job to just rejoin the rear of the peloton — which is where he stayed.
There's no question Démare would have made it over the Cipressa, if he hadn't been caught up in the crash. But that's cycling. Crashes happen.
Belgium, terrorism, and the classics
There was a lot of talk about if Dwars door Vlaanderen should go ahead or not after the tragic events in Brussels. Originally, I couldn't give cycling much thought. But upon reflection, what Jens Debusschere did at Dwars was true Belgian spirit — he won in the face of adversity. Cycling is loved by the Belgians, and for a Belgian to win, in Belgium, it was a small gift to the people.
The following day there was another Belgian victory, at Volta a Catalunya. The queen stage, no less, by Thomas De Gent. Belgies are awesome and tough people.
Here's the thing with dealing with terrorism as a professional cyclist — everyone deals with it differently. Some bike riders are bloody selfish. I've read numerous tweets about riders upset that their travel plans have taken so long. In reality, lives were lost. Families were destroyed. Police are still identifying bodies. Nobody gives a shit if you were delayed for your bike race or if you missed it altogether. Have some perspective. It's not about you.
People ask me what it's like to race on open roads, after incidents like this, or what happened at the Boston Marathon. And it's not easy. It's not like I line up at the start of the race thinking “What if?” There is just this cloud in your brain, asking why. Why, in this day and age, does religion mean you would want to kill innocent people?
I think if I were running the 100m final at an Olympic game, and this had just happened, then yes, 100,000 people in an Olympic stadium, it's the perfect target. But a bunch of guys wearing spandex, bouncing over cobbles on push bikes… probably not an obvious target.
Then you think about it again, and celebrating sport and trying to carry on like nothing has happened, that's not correct either.
It's a hard situation. It's a scary situation.
E3 Harelbeke and Gent-Wevelgem showed us a few things heading into De Ronde and Paris-Roubaix. The in-house fighting at Team Sky over who will be leader at Roubaix should be over by now. Stannard is better at these races than Rowe, and there's no doubt the whole team should support Stannard.
Etixx-QuickStep is, by far, the strongest in numbers, but this doesn't always convert to results for them.
I'm still waiting for Alexander Kristoff to fire a shot. To me it looks like his peak might be a little later this year, but you never know with him. I guess he was sick at Harelbeke, and he skipped Gent-Wevelgem altogether. But you should never underestimate Viking strength. We'll see what he can do at De Panne.
Peter Sagan is an animal, but one thing that I've noticed racing against him — when he has had a long escape, his final power is nothing like what he demonstrates in a full-on bunch kick. Part of the difference between his win at Gent-Wevelgem and his second place at Harelbeke was the size of the move; he was trading pulls with Kwiatkowski at Harelbeke, but had Cancellara, Vanmarcke, and the Katusha rider [Vyacheslav Kuznetsov] taking turns at Gent-Wevelgem. At the end of the race, that can make all the difference.
Cancellara was impressive at Harelbeke, riding back through the peloton, using his teammates to help him regain contact with the front group. I'm sure I have witnessed him do the same thing to us a few years ago, but that time he did it all alone, then continued to ride off solo for the victory. Maybe his engine isn't quite as big these days?
De Ronde van Vlaanderen and Roubaix are next. Bring on the classics, I say. Of the 10 million people in Belgium, it seems like half of them will line the roads of De Ronde , to show support to their sporting heroes and to show again that sport can do a small part in joining together a nation in times of need.
A Toledo, Ohio church has erected 9 billboards proclaiming that being gay “is NOT a gift from God,” the Toledo Blade reported.
The billboards are in response to a Central United Methodist Church's billboard that went up in April.
“Being gay is a gift from God,” the billboard read.
“Being Gay is NOT a Gift from God – Forgiveness, Love and Eternal Life Are,” said the counter billboards erected by the Church on Strayer, which claims a 2,500-member congregation.
“I love everyone. There's nothing on that billboard about hate,” the Rev. Tony Scott, who has led the church for 37 years, told the paper. “I'm getting hate mail from lesbian and gay people, but my point is that I love them too much to let someone believe a lie. I love this city too much to let a lie be sown.”
In a blog post, however, Scott called homosexuality a “deviant lifestyle” and suggested that sexual orientation is a choice.
“In more than 30 years of counseling with people who have chosen the gay lifestyle, not one of them has ever said – 'I am delighted to be gay.' No one has ever said to me, 'My gay lifestyle is a gift from God.' In every case, those engaged in this deviant lifestyle shared with me the pain of their choice, along with the shame and guilt they carry,” Scott wrote.
MADISON, Wis. — Gov. Scott Walker made the case in his State of the State speech Wednesday that extra money collected thanks to an improving national economy should be returned as property and income tax cuts, even as some Republicans are saying his proposal goes too far.
Walker, in a speech that also doubled as an argument for his re-election in November, asked lawmakers to approve $504 million in property and income tax cuts over the next 17 months.
"The state of our state is strong and improving every day," Walker said during a joint meeting of the Legislature in a packed Assembly chamber. "The economy is dramatically better and our finances are in great shape. Still, there is more work to be done."
The speech, Walker's fourth State of the State as governor, comes as he's running for re-election this year and trying to position himself as a possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Democrat Mary Burke, a former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive, is challenging him in the governor's race.
Walker's tax cut proposal — which would save a typical home-owning family about $150 a year — was made possible by updated projections released last week that showed the state would collect $912 million more than previously anticipated.
But elements of the tax cut plan are running into opposition from some Republican state senators who say it increases the state's projected budget shortfall too much. Republicans control the Senate 18-15 and have a broader 60-39 majority in the Assembly.
Heading into the 2015 two-year budget, the state already faces a $725 million projected shortfall. That would grow by about $100 million under Walker's proposed tax cut, but those estimates don't take into account future revenue growth.
Tax collections would only have to grow 1.5 percent to wipe out that shortfall, Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said Wednesday. Net tax collections are projected to increase by 2.2 percent by July and another 4.3 percent by mid-2015.
Republican Sen. Luther Olsen, of Ripon, said Walker's tax cut plan will have to be scaled back so the projected shortfall doesn't grow.
"We have to reduce it," Olsen said. "We ran on that stuff."
Republican Senate President Mike Ellis said his preference would be to reduce the size of Walker's proposed income tax cut to help lower the projected deficit, if it appeared revenue growth wouldn't be strong enough to eliminate it.
"Every conservative has been against inordinate deficits," Ellis said.
Still, Fitzgerald said that while Republican senators were concerned about the growth in the shortfall, they were also supportive of cutting taxes. Ellis, while voicing concerns about the deficit growing, called the property tax cut "exciting," ''fantastic" and "significant."
"There's definitely a willingness to return the money to taxpayers," Fitzgerald said.
That's also Walker's approach.
"What do you do with a surplus?" he said in the speech. "Give it back to the people who earned it. It's your money."
Walker said on Thursday he would call for a special session of the Legislature to consider his tax cut proposals, a new initiative to help people with disabilities find work, and a $35 million worker training initiative.
Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Tuesday indicated that Walker's tax cut plan is likely to pass the Assembly largely the same as proposed. Vos downplayed concerns over the shortfall, saying his highest priority is cutting taxes.
Walker's proposed tax cuts would equal $101 in property tax savings for the owner of a median-valued $151,000 home and between $44 and $58 in income tax savings, depending on how a person files. Walker wants to cut the lowest income tax rate from 4.4 percent to 4 percent.
Walker also said he ordered the state Department of Revenue earlier Wednesday to update income tax withholding tables, which will result in a typical family of four keeping about $58 more a month starting in April.
"The days of double-digit tax increases, billion-dollar deficits, and major job loss are gone," Walker said. "We replaced them with massive tax cuts, growing budget surpluses, and significant job growth. Wisconsin is going back to work."
Democratic critics were quick to point out that Wisconsin ranks 37th in private sector job growth over the 12-month period that ended in June. And Walker is not on pace to meet his 2010 campaign pledge to create 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of this year.
"Too many Wisconsinites are unemployed or stuck in low-wage, part-time jobs relying on food stamps and friends and family to make ends meet," said Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO. "Gov. Walker should be laying the foundation for long-term fiscal health by investing in worker training programs, infrastructure, and education to ensure that every Wisconsinite has access to a long-term family-supporting job with decent benefits."
Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barça said Tuesday that raising the budget shortfall was "irresponsible" and that Walker's tax cuts don't do enough to target the middle class and poor people who don't have any income tax liability.

The constitutional court in Romania has said it will consult with a top European court over whether a marriage between a Romanian and his same-sex American husband will be recognised.
The court will liaise with the European Court of Justice over whether the marriage of Adrian Coman, a Romanian gay rights activist and US-born Claibourn Robert Hamilton.
The couple married in 2010 in Belgium and are seeking to have Romania recognise their relationship.
The courts will discuss how other countries in the EU which have not legalised same-sex marriage handle similar cases.
A hearing has been set in the case for 30 March.
If the couple had been straight, the marriage would be legally recognised by authorities in Romania.
After failing in the United States, American evangelicals are now attempting to push a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in Romania.
The country earlier this year moved towards ruling out the legalisation of equal marriage as its top court has opened the door to a referendum to redefine marriage.
The Constitutional Court's nine judges on Wednesday ruled that a proposal signed by three million Romanians was valid, which could lead to a referendum on defining marriage as only between one man and one woman.

Billie Burke's Advice
Selected entries from actress Billie Burke's regular column in the Fort Wayne Sentinel Billie Burke on Hair and Make-up
12th September, 1912
Billie Burke on Hairdressing
The first word: NEVER MIND THE FASHION. DRESS YOUR HAIR BECOMINGLY
I see by the hair shop windows and the shape of the new fall hats that the elaborate coiffure is still to be worn this fall and winter.
"What has the shape of the hat got to do with it?" you ask. A great deal; hair-dressing always follows the shape of the hat, and with the big crowns that one sees in all the new hats, one must dress one's hair in a way to fill them out.
Many young women follow every vagary of fashion in regard to the hair, and regardless of the fact that they may have round faces and low foreheads, they will this year bring their braids and twists forward clear over their foreheads, and allow little curls which peep from under to reach their eyebrows. It will not matter to them whether their braids are large or small; they will pile on fake hair because it is the fashion.
Many women look well with their hair arranged elaborately, but it usually adds ten years to one's face no matter how becoming it is. As a rule the simpler one combs one's hair, the younger it will make one look, although many women can in their later years improve upon their youthful style of hairdressing.
Coiffures should grow more formal as one grows older, and after one turns gray nothing but the most elaborate hair-dressing of puffs and soft braids should be used.
Don't, I beg of you if your hair is turning gray, think it will look well with flying tendrils and wisps about your face. These may be all right on a young girl, but they make a woman over forty look like a picture of the Witch of Endor.
I think one's hair shows age sooner than any other part of one with the exception of the hands. Even if your hair does not grow gray, it becomes limp and stringy. It does not seem to have that life and electric energy which makes it fluff and curl about a young face.
The girl whose hair grows pretty around her face is fortunate, indeed, and the one who has the "five points of Venus," as little points of hair at the ears, the temples and the one in the middle of the forehead are called, should always comb her hair so that they will show. There is, however, a little superstition about the girl whose hair grows in a deep point in the center of her forehead. It is that she will be a young widow.
A great many women of individuality wear their hair always in the same way. Mrs. Langtry has always worn hers in that soft, low coil at the nape of the neck which was so much worn by every English woman when she was the professional beauty of England. This way of combing the hair sets off the line from one's temple to one's shoulder perfectly. Bernhardt has always worn hewr hair in a tangle over her eyes and about her ears. She did this to conceal the thinness of her face. Ellen Terry has always affected a low hairdressing, with a big black bow. This sets off her blond coloring and brightens the gold of her hair. You see from my picture that I wear my hair very simply as it curls naturally about my face and I shall hate the day when I have to "tidy up" the stray locks.
It will be seen from the pictures which I have drawn, of some of the very latest coiffures, that to be in style you must wear either coils and braids from the nape of your neck clear over your forehead. The ears are covered and in many cases ornaments are placed just above them. A bright girl will look at these pictures and, seating herself before her mirror, can arrenge her hair so that it will have the same contour as these drawings, and yet she will give an original twist to her hair that is for her only. She can always remember one thing, however, even if she wears her hair very differently - she will not look out of style if she keeps her hair clean and fluffy, and dresses it becomingly.
Just One Last Word: IF A WOMAN'S HAIR IS HER CROWN OF GLORY, IT BEHOOVES HER TO KEEP IT BRIGHT AND SHINY, AS WELL AS PROPERLY PLACED.

Billie Burke Says There is Nothing So Hideous As a Lot of False Hair on a Girl's Head.
The First Word: ONE OF THE BEAUTIES THAT MEN LOVE MOST IN A WOMAN IS BEAUTIFUL HAIR.
Some poet has rhapsodized over hIS sweetheart's hair, declaring that she might draw him to her with a single strand. He was probably taking some poetical license, but the fact remains that all literature is full of references to the hair of women.
An actress has to be particularly careful of her hair, as the powder that gets into it and the many ways she must often wear it, often in a single evening, are very hard on it. But the actresses with fine hair are always very proud of it.
There is nothing so good for the hair as massage, and I am going to tell you how I massage mine. Before dressing the hair and when taking it down at night, loosen it by giving the ends two or three light shakes; place the tips of the fingers of both hands at the juncture of the hair and the forehead and then work them with a circular motion gently but firmly toward an imaginary center of the top of the head. At each turn of the fingers, let them work lightly on the surface, and then deeply, the first motion is for the hair follicles themelves, the next for moving the scalp on the head so as to make it soft, yielding and flexible.
Second Movement � Place the tips of the fingers so that the forefinger of each hand will meet at the spot where the last massage left off. This will bring the fingers of each hand over an ear at the juncture of the hair and skin. In the same manner as before, they should work over the hair roots with light and deep massage until the fingertips meet at the center at the top.
Third Movement � The fingers of each hand are placed so as to meet at the back of the neck where the hair begins and, describing the same motions an before, they work themselves upward to the center.
In this manner the entire scalp, in less than five minutes, receives a thorough stimulation. The hair responds at once and will he found full of life, and electricity, where before it was lifeless and dull. It will also make the whole head feel lighter and better. It will keep the scalp healthy and prevent the hair from falling.
Be sure that you dress your hair becomingly, and the simpler you dress it the better. There is nothing so hideous as a lot of false puffs and braids on the head of a pretty girl who would look stunning if she would only wear her own "glory crown" put up in a fashion that suited her.
Just One Last Word: KEEP YOUR HAIR CLEAN AND FLUFFY. BRUSH IT UNTIL IT BLOOMS AND IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF YOU DO NOT COMB IT IN THE LATEST FASHION IF THE WAY YOU DRESS IT IS BECOMING.

It's All Right to "Make Up" Your Face, Says Billie Burke, But Make It Look as if Nature Did the Work
More than half the requests I receive from my male friends say: "Please, Miss Burke, tell the girls not to use any make-up." They seem to think that if a girl is healthy she will be beautiful.
YOU CAN BE HEALTHFUL WITHOUT BEING BEAUTIFUL, BUT YOU CANNOT BE BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT BEING HEALTHY.
Consequently a judicious amount of artistic beautifying is not only permissible, but necessary, if a woman would appear at her best. No man should rail against women using face powder as in every barber shop now-adays powder is rubbed into the faces of patrons after a shave. I see no reason why a woman should allow her eyebrows to meet over her eyes or to show long, ugly, scragley hairs at the corners, when she can pull them out or even shave them off. Of course, some men might object to this if they knew their wives did it, but "wifey" might retort by asking, "Why do you shave the back of your neck? Aren't you as well as I, trying to improve upon nature?"
Tomorrow, after you have taken your bath, splash cold water all over your face and then take a piece of ice in a cheese cloth rag and rub it all over your face and neck until you have brought the blood to the surface. You will find this will brighten your eyes as well as freshen your complexion.
Now plaster your face and neck with a pure cold cream. Don't he stingy with it; rub it in with soft upward and circular strokes and wipe off all the superfluous cream. If you find that your ice and cream have not given you enough color, you can put just a very little rouge on each cheek. Most women who use rouge use the kind that comes in colored grease sticks. Put a little, dab upon each cheek bone near the eyes and a tiny bit on your chin. Now softly spread this upward toward the eyes and off toward the ears.
Some girls use a little rouge on their ears, as a tinted cheek and white ears apt to make one look tubercular or anaemic. Carefully examine your face in a hand glass to see that it is not in any way "patchy," then dust your face and neck all over with powder � and again, don't he stingy.
After this take your eyebrow brush and carefully brush out your eyebrows and wipe off your lashes with a heavy cloth between your thumb and forefinger. If your eyebrows are light in color, or thin, apply a little mascara, which is a water color and perfectly harmless. You can buy it at any drug store. If your lips are pale apply a little of the tinted cold cream. This will be good for them, as well as making them look better.
Leave, all your powder on until you have combed your hair, then take a powder puff, or better, the soft little brush which is used on a baby's hair, and brush off all the superfluous powder, using upward strokes until the very last, then going over the whole face quickly with downward strokes.
I'll wager after all this is done, if you do it carefully, the grimmest-eyed old bachelor will not be able to detect the slightest art in your make-up, and he will probably go around telling everybody what a pretty girl you are � so natural and unartificial.
Go ahead, girls, and do everything you can do to enhance your beauty, but remember that the cleverest and almost always the prettiest girl is the one who makes art look like nature at her best.

GETTING THOSE WRINKLES OUT 0F THE FACE by BILLIE BURKE
If your mirror tells you that you are thin enough to look well in the winter modes you can congratulate yourself and ask it some other questions. It is very probable that you will find some little wrinkles about your eyes and perhaps one or two between your eyes if you have been but of doors much this summer.
It is almost impossible to look the sun in the face or even to look into its bright rays while playing tennis or other outdoor games without squinting up the eyes. I have seen girls this fall whose skin about the eyes were full of little lines of white, as if they were put on with a paint brush because they had wrinkled it up when they were outdoors, little lines are rather fascinating when the rest of one's face is tanned brown.
But now, of course, you want to get these wrinkles out. You must understand that it is much easier to get wrinkles in your face than to take them out, just as it is easier for one to acquire a bad habit than to break it. The first thing to do is to give your face a steam bath. This is accomplished by pouring very hot water into a deep kettle and bending your face over it with a Turkish towel or any other heavy material thrown over both your head and the kettle. After your face is thoroughly steamed wipe it carefully and rub it well with a good cold cream. I have given the formula for one so often that it seems useless to do it again.
Now begins the massage: Take the first and second fingers of your left hand and very lightly stretch the skin about the corner of your eye until it is smooth, then rub very gently between with the forefinger of your right hand. The idea you must have in your mind while doing this is that you are smoothing out a precious bit of a very thin gold leaf � the kind you have seen at your dentist.
After you have smoothed the corners of both eyes very lightly, begin at the corners next the nose and draw the two first fingers of your hands across your eyelids. Then start with a little more strength at the bridge of your nose and rub over your eyebrows toward the temples, back over the cheek bone, up the side of the nose to the bridge again. Rub the wrinkles between the eyes across. Of course, you have to use cold cream to make these movements easy.
Now if you have a little time smooth out the wrinkles about your eyes and put over them a bit of court plaster; also over the ones between your eyes. Lie down and put a cloth wet with cold water over your eyes and keep perfectly still for a half hour thinking of nothing if possible.
Don't think because this is a good thing that you must do it every day � twice a week is sufficient, and remember that you can smile as well as frown without making wrinkles in your face. Consult your mirror on this subject.
In a summer full of wild signings, big trades and furious flurries of duct taping burnt jerseys back together, those in Cleveland are left smiling ear-to-ear with less than two months to go before the 2014-15 NBA season tips off.
But one of the more underrated stories of this Cleveland Cavaliers offseason has been the hiring of new head coach David Blatt. It's easy to get distracted by the rest of what's happening with the team (“MOM, WHERE'S THE DUCT TAPE?!”), but the fact remains that this is the guy who is going to be leading the Cavs along with golden boy LeBron James.
So for those who don't know much about Blatt, or what he's all about, get ready to buckle up.
Blatt is 55 years old and has coached for 21 of those years. He's from Framingham, Massachusetts and went to school at Princeton, where he played point guard for Pete Carril, the creator of the so-called “Princeton Offense.” Thus, Blatt's coaching style revolves around the Princeton Offense with slight tweaks here and there that he's made over the years.
He's managed to adapt his system to different players many times during his coaching career, which is probably how he was able to win 17 championships in different leagues and tournaments. According to Danny Chau of Grantland, he's also one of five coaches ever that has won a EuroBasket title (2007), a Euroleague title (2014) and a medal at the Olympics (2012; he coached Russia). Most recently, Blatt coached the Euroleague team, Maccabi Tel Aviv, to a 54-18 record this past season and eventually ended up winning the Euroleague Championship.
Whew, not a bad resumé, huh?
And not only that, but the players he's coached in the past have said that they really enjoyed having him as their leader. In fact, back in the 2012 Olympics, Dave D'Alessandro of The Star-Ledger newspaper wrote that Andrei Kirilenko said he believed Blatt to be a better coach than legendary former Lakers head honcho Phil Jackson. In that same article, Steve Mills (former Madison Square Garden president) was quoted as saying, “The record he's had in Europe, where he's dealing with NBA-caliber players all the time, shows that he's as good as anyone”.
So people believe in him. He's got the coaching records. He's got a great pedigree coming from Princeton. How about making that work with these new Cleveland Cavaliers?
Well, Blatt's system is something similar to what the San Antonio Spurs like to do, which isn't surprising since the Spurs have been said to look like a European-esque team in their offensive attack. There is lots of movement in Blatt's system, with backdoor cuts and swinging passes that open up various options to inflict damage on the opposing defense.
If played to perfection, some players might see a bit of a drop in their personal stats, since the system is more team-oriented. But then the question comes up: what's more important, stats or wins? Obviously, most would take the latter and that includes the likes of LeBron, who knows he needs a good team around him to make such a thing happen and so that he doesn't have to carry the offensive load anymore.
One of the key elements to the way Blatt's system already is will be the opening of lanes to the basket. With such proposed ball movement, players like LeBron and Kyrie Irving should have less of a problem driving to the rim as the area won't be clogged with defenders. Isolation ball should almost never be seen unless there's a final shot that needs to be taken or something.
This will be pleasantly different for James, who dealt with a lot of standing around during his tenure with the Miami Heat:
Another key cog in Blatt's system is the stretch-four, which (oh my goodness!) the Cavs just happen to have the NBA's best in Kevin Love. Having a big who can shoot consistently from beyond the arc will be a huge benefit to the club, as he can pull opposing big men out of the paint and give even more space to slashers. The fact that Love can also dominate on the boards like he can is almost an extremely good bonus. Like going to the movies and discovering that if you buy a ticket, you also get free popcorn.
Boris Diaw (who plays power forward) was able to do this sort of thing for the Spurs to a lesser extent. During San Antonio's playoff run last season, he shot 40 percent from deep on two three-point field goal attempts per game.
As it is, there is every reason to be excited about David Blatt if you're a Cavs fan. Sure this is his first year in the NBA, but if history has anything to say about it, it'll be a good one.
The new owners of the Newsroom – now named Black & Gold – are taking fandom to a new low. Owner Zack Cartwright tells KC Confidential he plans on hosting a celebration of the 1863 raid that killed hundreds of men and boys in Lawrence. Cartwright, who pledges allegiance to Mizzou, said the KU-MU rivalry will “never die,” but didn't elaborate about why the bar was hosting the event.
“August 21st of this year is the 150th anniversary of Quantrill's excursion to Lawrence, so we will be celebrating it here at the Black & Gold Tavern” Cartwright told KCC. “We might even take a bus load of Missouri fans over to Lawrence that night, but we'll leave the matches at home.”
On Aug. 21, 1863, William Quantrill led a group of pro-Confederate marauders from Missouri across the state line and attacked Lawrence, a symbolic capital of the Union. As many as 200 men and boys were killed in the slaughter, which also left the town smoldering. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the massacre.
Many people thought the KU-MU rivalry would die after Mizzou bolted to the SEC last year. Apparently some folks won't let it go.
In an August story about the upcoming anniversary, FOX4 posted a story with the unfortunate headline “City of Lawrence Celebrates Quantrill's Raid.”

Cataphracts were the most heavily armoured form of cavalry in the ancient world, with riders and mounts both clad in heavy armour. Originating among the wealthiest nobles of various central Asian steppe tribes, such as the Massegatae and Scythians, they were adopted and adapted by several major empires. The Achaemenid Persians, Seleucids, Sassanians and eventually the Romans and their Byzantine successors. Usually armed with long lances, they harnessed the mobility and mass of the horse to the durability and solid fighting power of the spear-armed phalanx. Although very expensive to equip and maintain (not least due to the need for a supply of suitable horses), they were potential battle winners and remained in use for many centuries. Erich B Anderson assesses the development, equipment, tactics and combat record of cataphracts (and the similar clibinarii), showing also how enemies sought to counter them. This is a valuable study of one of the most interesting weapon systems of the ancient world.
Anderson takes great care
to explain the gradual transition that the Roman Empire underwent from an infantry-centric
army to a cavalry-centric one. Pressed by the urgent need to protect its weakening borders
against barbarian incursions, the Roman army valued mobility as the primary attribute. The
book does a great job of clearly distinguishing different types of Roman armoured cavalry. It
goes an extra step further as to even cover the famed Byzantine cataphracts as well. Kunwon Saw, Freelance
This book is aimed at the general reader, rather than the more academic audience. As a result we avoid too many deeply technical discussions, and instead focus on the battlefield use of the cataphract and the development of the equipment used by them over the millennium that the type was in use.

I have read somewhere that cataphracts were the “Tiger Tanks” of the ancient empires…. Heavily armored, powerful, awesome, mobile but rather slow, and very expensive. Whether cataphracts were worth the cost is an ongoing debate.
This book is a detailed account of the known history and development of cataphracts. From their origins in central Asia, to the Parthians, the Persians, the Romans and finally, the Byzantines.
Every battle in which the cataphracts were known to have been involved, is described in detail, with emphasis on the contribution of the cataphracts. The battle descriptions are excellent, and I enjoyed Erich B Anderson's writing style. My only regret is that there are no maps.
There are extensive notes and a bibliography for those who wish to delve deeper.
I am happy to recommend this very interesting book, and to add it to my own library. Dr John Viggers
This volume, from independent scholar Anderson, is the first comprehensive survey of heavy armored cavalry – dubbed clibanarii, cataphracti, and more – that played a particularly important role in the military history of Late Antiquity… This is a good survey of the history of heavy cavalry in the ancient world, covering arms, equipment, organization, tactics, and battles New York Military Affairs

It was a dark evening in our parliament's history. Many has been the occasion when parliament has stood up against bad, dangerous government. Last night was not one of them. The Conservative Brexit government said to parliament “we don't have a clue what will happen if you vote for Brexit – but vote for it anyway.” And it did.
MPs vote to give May powers to trigger article 50 – as it happened Read more
The Liberal Democrats were the only UK-wide party that voted against. Labour could have joined us and blocked Theresa May's hard Brexit, but chose to sit on its hands. There will be families today fearful that they will be torn apart, no longer feeling welcome in Britain. Their only crime is that a member of the family was born somewhere else in the EU. Shamelessly, the government is using such people like chips in a casino. Shamefully, Labour has let them.
Jeremy Corbyn could have ensured ministers were held to account in Brexit negotiations, but gave his parliamentarians a night off and wrote a blank cheque to the government. May will try to use this to deliver the hardest and harshest of Brexits few voted for, endangering another union (this one the United Kingdom), damaging our economy and reducing the life chances of young people.
Labour is meant to be the opposition. For all the party's hard-left posturing, its politics of the placard, on the biggest question in a generation, Labour might as well have decamped to the Tory benches. Despite having so few MPs, we are now the only opposition to this government.
Apparently, May will trigger article 50 soon, despite rearing back from doing so today. I suppose we should be grateful on this occasion that our prime minister is a ditherer. To trigger article 50 while government Brexit strategy is in chaos would be an act of historic recklessness.
Ministers have simply not done the work to provide new trade deals. Even Liam Fox admits crashing out of the single market without new arrangements would be “bad” for Britain, itself a magisterial understatement. But if May rushes headlong into a panicked triggering of article 50 without a clear idea of what she wants out of negotiations, she will have left us at the mercy of 27 countries who have heard little but table-thumping and empty threats from ministers. Despite the sacking of wise heads such as Michael Heseltine, it is vital that Conservatives who believe in economic sanity find their voice. Just as Tory MPs are reminding the government of its manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance, so they must remind May of her party's manifesto commitment to stay in the single market.
Huge swathes of the population are disenfranchised by the lemming-like Labour-Tory rush over the cliff edge into a hard Brexit. Manchester Gorton will see a byelection in an area where 60% of people voted remain. Labour assumes it will win, but waving through Brexit is endangering worker rights, environmental protection and the future of immigrants. Many will be mystified: why wouldn't a progressive fight the Tories on this?
If you haven't, you can't plausibly fight them on anything else. Just as you can't have a hard Brexit and a strong economy, you can't have a hard Brexit and a strong NHS. The Brexit squeeze, caused by a falling pound and rising prices, will gnaw at consumer confidence which has been bolstering the economy. Make no mistake, with tax revenues struggling, the chancellor will shrink the state. And as ever, it will be the poor who pay the price.
Meanwhile, the very future of our union has been jeopardised by the so-called Conservative and Unionist party (I guess we should no longer be surprised: the Tories delighted in being “the party of business”, once). For genuine patriots – I'm not talking about the Tory/Ukip nationalists whose patriotism is built on mistrust of “others” – this is a nightmare: as an English patriot, I face the prospect of losing friends across the Channel and family the other side of Hadrian's Wall.
The Guardian view on another Scottish vote: Theresa May's homemade crisis | Editorial Read more
It is tempting to despair. But we can't give up. I am proud the Liberal Democrats are the only party fighting to protect our place in the EU while safeguarding that earlier union. All progressives should rally to this cause. If we fight hard Brexit, we can protect the union. And if we protect the union, together we can fight hard Brexit.
Events can still derail hard Brexit. A worsening economy could force Tories to come to their senses. And the longer it rumbles on, the clearer it will be that ministers have no plan. At every point progressives must fight, from securing pension rights for EU nationals who have paid taxes here for years to staying in Europol so we don't see a recreation of the Costa del Crime.
The Tories want to jump into the darkness. We don't need to jump with them.

115 Number of ODIs hosted at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, the fourth-most at any stadium, overtaking the Harare Sports Club (114). The only venues to host more ODIs are the Sharjah Cricket Stadium (216), the Sydney Cricket Ground (144) and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (138).
90 Runs scored by James Taylor, his maiden ODI fifty. He had only played two previous ODIs, both against Ireland, in 2011 and 2013, scoring 1 and 25 respectively in those games.
93 The partnership runs between James Taylor and Joe Root for the third wicket, England's best for any wicket this series. England had two partnerships of exactly 84, for the first and sixth wickets, in the third ODI at Hambantota.
1020 Runs scored by Kumar Sangakkara in 2014, the third most by any batsman. The two others to score more than 1000 ODI runs this year are Angelo Mathews (1183) and Virat Kohli (1054).
4 Number of consecutive years where Sangakkara has made 1000-plus ODI runs in each year. He is the first Sri Lankan, and third batsman overall, after Kohli and Saurav Ganguly, to achieve this feat. Sangakkara made 1127 runs in 2011, 1184 in 2012, 1201 in 2013 and 1020 in 2014.
30 Sixes hit by Jos Buttler in 40 ODIs, the most by an England wicketkeeper. Craig Kieswetter had hit 29 sixes in 43 ODIs.
9 Number of wickets taken by the Sri Lankan spinners during England's innings. This is the seventh instance of Sri Lankan spinners taking nine or more wickets, including an instance where they took all ten. Five of these seven instances have been at home, and two of those against England.
3 Number of Sri Lankan spinners who took three wickets each - Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis and Tillakaratne Dilshan. This is only the second instance in ODIs of three spinners taking three or more wickets in the same innings. The only other instance of this happening was by Bangladesh against Zimbabwe in 2009.
1527 Runs scored by Mahela Jayawardene against England in ODIs. He is one of only three batsmen to have scored 1500-plus ODI runs against England, the others being Viv Richards (1619) and Ricky Ponting (1598).

Hartlepool have named ex-England and Middlesbrough defender Colin Cooper as manager following the
Cooper has worked on the Bradford City coaching staff and had been employed as Middlesbrough's under-18 coach before taking up the Pools post.
The 46-year-old will be tasked with leading Pools back to League One after relegation this season.
He has named former Boro midfielder Craig Hignett as his assistant.
Cooper becomes the club's sixth manager in five years, including caretakers.

That turnover of managers, starting with the departure of Danny Wilson in December 2008, has seen a gradual slide from outsiders for the play-offs to relegation.
Chris Turner, Mick Wadsworth, Neale Cooper and most recently Hughes has all attempted to arrest the slump, and Cooper will now undertake the rebuilding process,
"I'm delighted for him and I think he's at a good age," former Middlesbrough boss Bruce Rioch told BBC Tees.
"He's had a good football career with a good pedigree and worked for some good managers at some good clubs.
"He knows the area well and has lots of experience of working at first-team level."
Born in Durham, Cooper came through the ranks to play under Rioch at Boro and made 239 appearances in his first spell before joining Millwall in 1991.
Two successful years in London led to a move to Nottingham Forest, where he earned England recognition before returning to Boro for a final spell as a player.
Time on the Middlesbrough coaching staff after his retirement was followed by a move to Bradford City as assistant to Peter Jackson.

Pro-Russian activists barricaded inside a government building in eastern Ukraine have proclaimed the region independent and called for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine - an ominous echo of the events that led to Russia's annexation of Crimea.
The Ukrainian government vowed to quell the unrest, while Russia, which has tens of thousands of troops stationed along their joint border, warned Ukraine of more "difficulties and crises" if its leaders failed to heed Moscow's demands.
Pro-Russian activists who had seized the provincial administrative building in the city of Donetsk over the weekend announced the formation on Monday of the independent Donetsk People's Republic. They also called for a referendum on the possible secession of the Donetsk region, which borders Russia, to be held no later than May 11, according to the Interfax news agency.
Russia annexed Crimea last month, following a referendum called just two weeks after the Black Sea peninsula had been overtaken by Russian forces. Ukraine and the West have rejected the vote and the annexation.
Outside the Donetsk building, a barricade of car tyres and razorwire was built up to prevent police from retaking it. Other armed activists fired warning shots in the air and tried to seize the regional state television building in Donetsk but retreated after police and guards in the building also fired warning shots in the air, Interfax cited police as saying.
Government buildings were also seized in two neighbouring Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities - Kharkiv and Luhansk - and top government officials headed there to try to quell the unrest.
But as of late Monday, the buildings in all three cities remained occupied by pro-Russian activists whom authorities said were armed.
In Kiev, President Oleksandr Turchinov described the developments in eastern Ukraine as an operation undertaken by Russia to sow instability.
"Anti-terrorism measures will be adopted against those who took up weapons," Mr Turchinov said, adding that parliament would convene on Tuesday to consider tougher penalties for separatist actions and a ban on separatist parties.
Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk also accused Russia of staging the unrest to create a pretext for sending troops across the border.
"The plan is to destabilise the situation, the plan is for foreign troops to cross the border and seize the country's territory, which we will not allow," he said, adding that those taking part in the unrest had distinct Russian accents.
In Washington, the White House warned Russia against intervening in eastern Ukraine and threatened further sanctions. Spokesman Jay Carney said there was strong evidence that some pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine were paid and not local residents.
Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt also said the events in eastern Ukraine were part of Moscow's "destabilisation strategy".
"Those who thought that it ended with Crimea were wrong," Mr Bildt said.
The Russian foreign ministry rejected the Ukrainians' allegations but reaffirmed its long-held demand that Ukraine should change its constitution to turn the country into a federation with broader powers for provinces. It added that such a move should also underline Ukraine's non-aligned stance and ensure a special status for the Russian language.
"If the political forces that call themselves the Ukrainian government continue to take an irresponsible attitude to the fate of the country and its people, Ukraine will inevitably face new difficulties and crises," the ministry said in a statement.
Mr Yatsenyuk said Russian troops were stationed within 30 kilometres (19 miles) of the border.
Eastern Ukraine, which has a large population of ethnic Russians, was the support base for ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of protests. Both economic and cultural ties to Russia are strong here and many are wary of the new government, which favours closer ties to the European Union.
But Ukraine's interim authorities deny they are infringing upon the rights of ethnic Russians or Russian-speakers and there has been no evidence of them facing harassment in Ukraine.
The international community has expressed growing anxiety over the large Russian troop movements along the Ukrainian border. Nato says up to 40,000 Russian troops have mobilised and present a distinct threat to Ukraine. Russia says it has the right to move its troops wherever it wants on its own territory.
In a video posted on the internet, an unidentified pro-Russian activist in the Donetsk government headquarters asked Russian president Vladimir Putin to send peacekeeping troops into the region.
"Without your support, without the support of Russia, it will be hard for us to resist the Kiev junta on our own," the man said, referring to the interim authorities that took power in Ukraine after the overthrow of Mr Yanukovych.
But a senior Russian politician suggested on Monday that such a move was not imminent. Viktor Oserov, head of the defence committee in the Russian parliament's upper house, said Russia cannot send peacekeepers into Ukraine without a resolution by the UN Security Council, according to Interfax.
The ITAR-Tass state news agency cited the deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, Ilyas Umakhanov, as saying that the situation in Donetsk was not a replay of Crimea.
"I don't think this situation automatically reflects what happened in Crimea ... from the judicial, historical and legal points of view, it demands a separate assessment," Mr Umakhanov said.
Russian news agencies also reported on Monday that prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the death of a Crimea-based Ukrainian army major who was shot and killed by a Russian soldier in a scuffle on Sunday.
In Kharkiv, pro-Moscow activists declared themselves "alternative" regional legislators and proclaimed a "sovereign Kharkiv People's Republic", the Interfax news agency reported.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration is hoping to increase the number of participants in the city's bike sharing program by offering inexpensive, one-year Divvy memberships to low-income residents, though the powder-blue bicycles aren't available to rent in several Chicago neighborhoods where many poor people live.
Annual memberships will be cut to $5 from $75 for single-person households with income below $35,310 per year under a program paid for with $75,000 over the next two years from both the nonprofit Better Bike Share Partnership and Divvy's sponsor, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Emanuel said Tuesday.
The "Divvy for Everyone" program will only allow people to get the cheaper membership for one year. After that, they'd have to pay the regular rate, though Transportation Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said the city will "be continuing to work to develop ways to graduate people into a second year at a full membership rate." That might be allowing people to pay the $75 yearly fee in installments, she said.
The city hopes 750 low-income people sign up each of the next two years at the $5 rate, Scheinfeld said after joining Emanuel to announce the program in Bronzeville.
Divvy rental stations are only installed as far south as 75th Street and as far west as Pulaski Road, leaving large areas of the South and West sides without easy access to the bikes. A bid to team up with Evanston and Oak Park to add more rental stations on the North Side and the West Side is "still in the planning phase," Scheinfeld said.
"At this point, we don't have a specific next phase of expansion," she said.
The Divvy bike-sharing program has been a pet project for Emanuel, along with controversial protected bicycle lanes and other moves to promote biking.

This spring, the city added 176 rental stations, bringing the total number citywide to 477, which helped blunt campaign criticism that the Emanuel administration was focusing on wealthier, denser neighborhoods with the bike rental stations, to the exclusion of swaths of the city.
The $5 membership for low-income residents is even less costly than the $7 cost for a 24-hour pass. Divvy memberships normally require a credit card or debit card, but that will not be necessary under the low-cost program. Children younger than 16 can get the memberships, but parents or guardians need to sign up for them, according to Chicago Transportation Department spokesman Michael Claffey.
These steps could help the mayor make the case that the bike rental program is now affordable and convenient for more Chicagoans.
Olatunji Oboi Reed, co-founder of bicycle advocacy group Slow Roll Chicago, applauded the city for making Divvy memberships available to people who might not otherwise even consider buying them. But he argued that the parts of the city that don't have bike-friendly amenities are the ones that could benefit most from adding them, by getting people who in many cases don't have cars to start bicycling to get around.
"I suspect part of it is, the city is interested in providing infrastructure — both Divvy stations and bike lanes — in neighborhoods where they'll be used the most," Reed said. "We want to see bike lanes everywhere, even where people traditionally don't bike. What it takes to get more people to bike is for people to feel safe riding bikes in neighborhoods."

Vadodara: Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP may gain control of a taluka (tehsil) panchayat in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as eight rebel BJP members on Monday said they wanted to join it.
Savli taluka panchayat, with a total of 17 members, was controlled by BJP, which had 10 members. Congress has six members and one member is an independent.
However, eight members of the ruling party on Monday tendered resignations, formed a group and seized power with the support of independent member.
The eight rebel BJP members said they were willing to join AAP, which recently came to power in Delhi by winning an unprecedented 67 out of 70 seats.
"We are in touch with AAP party leadership about our intentions of joining the party in the presence of Arvind Kejriwal at a time suitable to him. We want to organise a big rally of our supporters who will cross over from BJP to AAP in his presence," said Jayesh Bakrola, the leader of the group.
If the cross-over takes place, the group will gift AAP power in a local body in Gujarat for the first time, without fighting an election.
Savli taluka panchayat comes under Vadodara parliamentary constituency from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had contested Lok Sabha election. (He later resigned and retained Varanasi seat.)
State BJP president RC Faldu had served suspension notice to these eight members for breaching the party whip in taluka panchayat president and vice-president elections.
"We sent our reply in the form of resignations today," Bakrol said. Other members of the group are Dhirendrasinh Rathod, Vilasben Rana, Bhavnaben Solanki, Kailashben Solanki, Sureshbhai Vasava, Thakorbhai Parmar and Yashwantbhai Bhaliya.

Anti-BREXIT yellows can siphon away blue votes as well as red ones.
While most pundits appear to have focused on Labour's problems over BREXIT let's not forgot that the Tory support base is even more divided. YouGov's latest BREXIT tracker published yesterday had the above splits in party supporters view of the issue that's set to define British politics.
As can be seen the Tory voter base goes 63% right to 33% wrong on current views of the BREXIT vote. Labour, by comparison has 25% saying decision was right with 69% saying wrong.
While people are talking about the pincers LD-UKIP pincer movement on Labour voters there same exists but more so for the Tory leadership.
With the LDs kicking on the heels of the Tories in many of the seats Cameron's party gained in 2015 Mrs. May has to tread very carefully.
With Farron's party fighting hard in Copeland with an unequivocal anti-BREXIT message the by-election will be a test for both main parties.

Using Mobile Screens To Make Reading Easier For Dyslexics
This is a fascinating article on a few different levels.
The fact that the the astrophysicist, Martin Schneps, who directs a laboratory at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, is also dyslexic is pretty cool. I know I sometimes roll my eyes at the over-emphasis on showcasing bright people with dyslexia. However, I still can't help but feel good about some of these non-celebrities doing such advanced high level work and who happen to have dyslexia. It just blows apart the myth that dyslexia and intelligence are connected.
Even though the heavy preponderance and longstanding evidence that primary weaknesses of the “dyslexic brain” are in the lower rote aspects of language processing and not a visual impairment, there are obviously visual components to reading. This article correctly points to some interesting studies that I've seen before, which indicate that many people with dyslexia pick up information from peripheral vision faster than non-dyslexics.
I appreciate that Dr. Shneps is doing research on the effects of smaller screens on reading efficiency for struggling readers.
Personally I'm not a great fan of reading on a phone, but love to do so on my iPad.
Reading on an iPad has some other features though, not mentioned, besides a smaller screen than a laptop, that are very helpful to the enjoyment and ease of reading.
Being able to instantly get a definition or pronounciation of a word is helpful to be sure. Just the ease of jotting notes into a digital book, bookmarking and saving pages, makes applying and retaining what I read so much easier and more enjoyable.
As Locky has gotten older I have made it a point to try and find or come up with new and exciting activities for him to do, and an activity book is a great choice. At this age they seem to get bored easily and once he works something out, which is usually fairly quick he instantly wants to move on to the next thing and a lot of the time I'm not prepared and am left trying to figure out how to entertain him. Of course he plays with his toys, blocks, books, paints, craft… You name it he does it but he seems to just need more. This simple toddler shapes activity book has been a real hit.
I decided to create what I like to call a toddler shapes activity book. Pretty much a toddler friendly book that won't get destroyed in two seconds, you get my drift?
Printable Toddler Shapes Activity Book
I'm sure you do if you have a destructive toddler like mine and if you don't then you will soon learn or your just lucky and I'm slightly jealous of you. After creating the files for this activity book, I printed, laminated and hole punched each page for the book part of the project. I purchased a clear folder so that he can easily see the front cover.
I printed the pages with the matching coloured shapes, cut them out, lamimated them and cut the laminated shapes making sure I didn't leave any sharp edges so neither of the kids cut themselves. I placed a thick plastic sleeve in the back of the folder to house the shapes once Locky has finished the activity book options. I had some random leftover velcro in my sewing kit that I quickly hot glued onto each shape in the book and the back of the loose shapes I previously cut.
Voila!
A fun and interesting activity for any toddler looking for something to do. Plus it's a great start to learning shapes. Might be a while before they understand the big word shapes.
Locky loved it. He is only 2 so at first he was a little confused but after showing him a couple of times he figured it out and it seemed to challenge him just enough to keep him occupied and thinking but not too much as to cause an emotional breakdown! Ha, toddlers and their tantrums. He loved identifying all the colours and then pointing out the shapes he knew in the activity book. Once he started figuring out that he must stick the matching shapes together he started really focusing on lining it all up perfectly while asking what the name of the “new” shapes where.
Let me know if you give this a go.
To make your life easier I have attached a PDF copy of the toddler shapes activity book and the shapes cutout PDF with instructions right here. Just click on the links to download your copy.
I hope to enjoy the activity as much as we do!

Guitarist Dweezil Zappa, the son of Frank Zappa, recently took to Facebook to respond to critics of his strict concert photography contact.
On September 22nd, the Facebook group Music Photographers posted a copy of Zappa's photography agreement:
As you can see, the contact states that photographers must permanently sign over “all rights” of their photos for commercial and promotional usage to Dweezil Zappa for no payment. High-res, non-watermarked photos are due within 5 days, and photographers must notify Zappa if they wish to promote their photos on their own websites.
Photographers began chiming in on Facebook, with the vast majority saying that they wouldn't sign this restrictive contract to shoot Zappa's shows.
After a few days of conversation, Zappa himself left a comment on September 25th to offer his response:
“Gee, there's never been a time when ‘photographers' have taken advantage of their subjects, people in the public eye by requesting to take photos for free in order to make money off of them without any approval of any kind,” writes Zappa.
“I don't particularly care to be photographed so if there happens to be an occasion where it will take place I am well within in my rights to request control over the images,” he says. “If people don't like the terms they don't take photos. It's pretty simple.”
Photographers didn't take kindly to Zappa's words, calling the statement “unprofessional” and “prejudiced” in replies to the comment.
Back in June, singer Taylor Swift's contract became the center of attention after photographer Jason Sheldon wrote an open letter to Swift about it. The following month, Swift's photo agreement was reworded with help from the NPPA.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Jerome Kerviel says his walk from Rome to Paris has been liberating
The French rogue trader who caused huge losses at bank Société Générale has lost his appeal against a three-year jail sentence.
France's highest court upheld the jail sentence against Jerome Kerviel but ordered a review of the 4.9bn euros (£4.1bn) in damages he was told to pay.
The court said a lower court decision had not taken into account the bank's own responsibility when it ordered him to make good the bank's entire losses.
Kerviel's lawyer called it "a victory".
"We are starting afresh," said David Koubbi.
"We are going to ask for an expert assessment to establish exactly what happened at Société Générale. This is the end of the Jerome Kerviel case and the beginning of a new case against Société Générale."
The bank responded by saying: "Jerome Kerviel has lost his court case. Société Générale has won. There were failings at the Société Générale but they have been repaired."
'Available to police'
Société Générale revealed in 2008 that Kerviel had run up $50bn (£33bn; 38bn euros) of unauthorised trades which had to be unwound.
The process cost the bank 4.9bn euros - the biggest loss of its kind in history.
A new civil trial will take place to decide the eventual damages Kerviel will have to pay.
Kerviel has spent the past three weeks walking back to Paris from Rome, where he met Pope Francis, and is currently near Bologna.
He told the BBC the walk was helping him to come to terms with his past and his future.
Kerviel has always admitted the unauthorised trades, but said officials at Société Générale knew what he was doing but turned a blind eye as long as it was making money, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris.
Kerviel said: "The only goal was money, money, money for the bank. I didn't care about what I was doing."
He said he was not trying to evade justice: "I am going back to France - I remain at the disposal of justice and the police, so if they want me I am available."
There is a highly disturbing story out of Florida where the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has uncovered instructions from the U.S. Marshals Service that appear to tell police to actively deceive judges and defendants about the use of the controversial surveillance tool called Stingrays, or IMSI catchers, which simulate a cellphone tower and trick any nearby mobile devices into connecting with them. The federal officials reportedly told police to lie to courts and defendants and say that the suspect's location came from a “confidential source.”
The ACLU acquired five emails from April, 2009 detailing the deception. The emails are shocking and constitute an open and knowing effort to lie to courts in sworn documents — a crime. In one email, a Sarasota Police Department sergeant flagged that a North Port detective had mistakenly told the truth about the source of information and “specifically outlined the investigative means used to locate the suspect.” The detective was told to “submit a new PCA [probable cause affidavit] and seal the old one.” That would put a false account on the record and seal the truth. The instructions were clearly stated as coming from the U.S. Marshals: “In the past, and at the request of the U.S. Marshalls [sic], the investigative means utilized to locate the suspect have not been revealed so that we may continue to utilize this technology without the knowledge of the criminal element. In reports or depositions we simply refer to the assistance as ‘received information from a confidential source regarding the location of the suspect.' To date this has not been challenged . . . ” That last part is particularly galling. It suggests that they have succeeded in the deception because no one is the wiser and no challenge has been brought. It is not only a knowing conspiracy to mislead the courts but it is a denial of protection constitutional rights of defendants to use evidence. It is not clear if this effort resulted in any false oral testimony from police on the stand.
The U.S. Marshals Service has not responded to calls for comment.
Average citizens are routinely charged with even the smallest misrepresentations to federal officials or false statements in court or before the grand jury. Here is a paper trail showing an express effort to deceive courts and defendants and file false sworn statements. Yet, there is no indication of a single disciplinary action, let alone a criminal investigation.

U.S. stocks closed slightly lower on Monday, with the S&P 500 extending 2014 losses into a third session, as mixed economic data put investors in a cautious mode ahead of the jobs report at the end of the week.
"The precursor to the main event this week is the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes on Wednesday, then all eyes on the payrolls number," said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, referring to the nonfarm payrolls figure for December, set for release on Friday.
The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index came in at 53.0 in December, versus estimates that the index would climb to 54.6 from 53.9 the month before.
While under forecasts, the index still came in "well above the 50-line of demarcation," said Stone of the level that separates expansion from contraction. The services report was also offset by "better-than-expected factory orders, which is the real deal, although more dated," said Stone, referring to separate data from the Commerce Department, which reported new orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded in November, increasing 1.8 percent.
Economic reports released ahead of the open showed service industry growth slowed in China in December but gained momentum across most of Europe.
"The Chinese number didn't help us; Europe is healing but still on the edge," said Stone of the economic data from overseas.
Shares of JetBlue Airways fell more than 4 percent after the airline said it would temporarily halt service in Boston and at the three New York regional airports as it contends with weather-related disruptions. Whole Foods Market declined after Longbow Research said the company's profit margin could decline as it hikes discounts to compete with rivals.
Men's Wearhouse hiked its offer for Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, days after the smaller rival increased its buyout defenses. Boston Scientific climbed after Morgan Stanley recommended the drug manufacturer's shares. Shares of Walgreen rose after the drugstore chain reported increased sales in December.

‘My thinking was I'm not going to buy a car until I'm going to have a driving license,' said Jakub Vrana, shown here after getting drafted in 2014. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)
Jakub Vrana successfully flashed both turn signals, but when the examiner asked him to flip on the hazard lights next, he panicked. What were those again? Time moved slowly as he scanned the buttons on the rental car. Finally, Vrana spotted the red triangle. Of course, the hazard lights.
“I'm so happy I passed,” the Czech Washington Capitals forward said. “I don't want to hear ‘driving license' for the rest of my life.”
Getting a driver's license is an exciting rite of passage for American teenagers. But it's a chore for European NHL players who come to the United States and learn their foreign licenses are valid for only so long, and some put it off for years. It can be the difference between a player feeling like he is a tourist or at home here, a card that represents some permanence of residency and grants a certain independence.
“My thinking was I'm not going to buy a car until I'm going to have a driving license,” Vrana said. “Now I have the green light, I can go buy a car, so it's a big deal for me.”
[First came Ovechkin and Backstrom, now Capitals have Vrana and Kuznetsov]
Russian, German and French players can take the theoretical part of the driving test in their native language, but Swedes, Finns, Czechs — about 140 NHLers — as well as some other nationalities are stuck with English, a language they may not be entirely comfortable with when they first start playing here. Words such as “pedestrian,” “yield” and “detour” initially tripped up Vrana, 21, who said he studied for three days before taking the test earlier this month. He and fellow rookie Christian Djoos, a 23-year-old Swedish defenseman, played for Washington's minor league affiliate in Hershey, Pa., for two seasons before they finally got Virginia driver's licenses this year.
“I think you need it,” Djoos said. “I was just lazy my two years in Hershey, and it's too bad. I should've gotten it right when I got over here. It definitely feels good to have it. You need it to go get groceries or pick family up from the airport or do whatever.”
Waiting is actually pretty common; Nashville Predators forward Calle Jarnkrok, from Sweden, relied on teammates Mattias Ekholm and Filip Forsberg to chauffeur him around for two years in Nashville until he finally got a license and bought a car. Every state is different, but in most cases, an international license is valid for up to one year after entering the U.S. One Eastern Conference player, who asked to remain anonymous, admitted to still using his foreign license to drive, and he has been here more than seven years.
“If you have a driver's license in Norway, I think you should be able to just, like, get it over here when you move here,” Rangers forward Mats Zuccarello said, referencing his native country. “I mean, you took all of the tests and everything in Norway, or wherever you're from. I came as a 23-year-old or as a 22-year-old and I have to do the tests and stuff and 16-year-olds drive here.”
Finnish Dallas Stars goaltender Kari Lehtonen said he's “heard some horror stories with other guys,” but his personal tale remains memorable more than a dozen years later. Drafted by the Atlanta Thrashers in 2002, Lehtonen got his license in Chicago, where the minor-league affiliate was at the time. “They told me, ‘No worries. Let's go after practice,'” Lehtonen said with a chuckle.
“So, this older gentleman, Mike ‘The Hat,' was a friend of the owner and did some work for the team,” Lehtonen continued. “He took me with his Cadillac to the DMV, and a huge line of course was there. We walked in front of the line, and he said something. Then we went in the back and did the test together.
“My English wasn't great, so he showed me which ones to pick, the answers. Then we needed to do the driving test with his Cadillac there. We're at the parking lot in front of the DMV, and I needed to turn the car on and drive straight into the next parking spot. And that was it.”
[Andre Burakovsky scores in overtime to give Capitals a rare win in Dallas]
Capitals forward Andre Burakovsky failed the Virginia driver's license test the first time he took it. “I thought it would be really easy, so I didn't study for it,” the 22-year-old said. The first part of the knowledge exam is 10 traffic sign questions, and those must all be answered correctly before part two, where an 80-percent grade or better passes. Burakovsky said he just didn't understand some questions, and he might have dismissed the difficulty after the infamous Swedish theoretical driving test – 70 questions long with at least 52 required to be right.
“When I finally passed that one, I was telling myself that I was never going to study for a driving test again,” Burakovsky said. “Then I came over here and they told me I have to get a license.”
Once a license is acquired, then comes the adjustment to actually driving here.
“I have seen one teammate get pulled over, roll his window down about three inches and just stick cash out the window,” Capitals defenseman Brooks Orpik said. “That obviously doesn't work too well here. And then he didn't speak English, so he had to call a teammate and have the teammate talk to the cop. I'm not going to say who it was, but that was a little tricky.”
The hard part finally out of the way, now all that's left for Vrana is buying a car, perhaps that all-black SUV he's been envisioning for years.
“We'll see,” Vrana said. “I've got to be smart about it, you know? It's my first car.”

Fire destroyed the last Claymont station more than 25 years ago.
Locals hope redevelopment of the nearby steel plant will hasten construction.
Project might be a candidate for federal transit grant funding this year.
Rail commuters will likely wait several more years for restrooms, ticket sales and pedestrian improvements in Claymont, despite making up the largest SEPTA ridership in Delaware behind Wilmington.
Officials recently eliminated funds for Claymont's long-delayed train station from the seven-year budget for state transportation projects, but redevelopment of the shuttered Evraz Claymont Steel site next door could boost the station's prospects.
"It gives us a blank slate. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to redo that train station," said Brett Saddler, executive director of the Claymont Renaissance Development Corp.
"Right now, we have nothing more than a glorified bus shelter and a porta-potty."
Delaware Transit Corp. began preliminary talks this month with St. Louis, Missouri-based Commercial Development Company Inc., which expects to close on the 300-acre Evraz property by month's end.
"There might be some additional funding, and could be some level of public-private partnership with those developers to say, we could both benefit from some of these improvements, whether it's an exchange of land or some other stuff," said John Sisson, chief executive officer of DTC. "How we work it out, I'm not 100 percent sure yet."
Randall Jostes, Commercial Development's CEO, said he discussed the station concept with officials but hasn't seen any renderings or plans yet.
"We are supportive of the idea and look forward to seeing just what would be involved with an expansion," Jostes said Monday. "From a real estate development perspective, mass transportation in the vicinity is a plus."
Popular station
Efforts to upgrade the rail stop date to 1990. Fire destroyed the last train station in Claymont more than 25 years ago.
Located midway between Philly and Wilmington, Claymont averaged more than 1,120 riders a day last year, compared with 2,000 riders at Wilmington, according to SEPTA figures.
"People forget that Brandywine A Hundred is actually the largest concentration of population in the state. There's many, many people here working in the Philadelphia metro area," New Castle County Councilman John Cartier said.
"Claymont rail stop is an enormous success. That's despite all its limitations and how inconvenient it is, especially if you're elderly or have mobility issues."
Some commuters drive from southern Pennsylvania or from Wilmington for Claymont's free parking (lots downtown and in Pennsylvania charge for parking).
The rail stop is bounded by I-495 on the west, the Delaware River to the east, and Fox Point State Park to the south. It's connected to the rest of Claymont by a single, two-lane road, Myrtle Avenue.
On weekdays, riders pack the 430-space lot, which serves as "overflow" parking for Wilmington's station. If the main lot is full, motorists must drive back out to Philadelphia Pike and seek street parking along Governor Printz Boulevard Extended. The secondary parking area connects to the main lot by an aging pedestrian bridge over I-495.
"If we had sidewalks and lighting as you walk from the pedestrian bridge to and from Philadelphia Pike, that would really be an improvement," said Jillian Waldman, a teacher at Archmere Academy who commutes from her home in North Philly.
"The path is trash covered and poorly lit. Then, a car crashed at the corner right there two weeks ago, and it's really made me nervous."
Commuters huddle beneath retrofitted bus shelters on the platform to escape storms. A narrow pedestrian tunnel to reach the northbound platform floods during storms, requiring a generator and heavy-duty pumps to make it passable. With no elevators, officials overhauled wheelchair lifts in the tunnel in 2013.
"The lifts are very slow," said Dave Gula, a senior planner with the Wilmington Area Planning Council. "It barely meets basic requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act."
Platform relocation
New riders notice that trains arriving in Claymont lean at a disconcerting angle. That's because the tracks are canted due to the platforms' location along a curve in the railroad line, making for difficult boarding.
"The train leans toward you. It takes a little effort to get up on it because it's leaning so much," said Robert Cameron, who lives in the Ashburn Hills community and takes SEPTA two or three times a week to shop at Reading Terminal Market.
A 2010 study recommended a station building on the northbound side of the tracks, north of the curve.
"That would mean going into the Evraz steel grounds," said Cartier, who represents Claymont.
"When that sale eventually goes through, we could have the real possibility of relocating the rail stop on a straight part of the tracks. I requested of the developer that they make accommodations for relocation of the rail site."
The 2010 study, commissioned by WILMAPCO, also called for high-level platforms, weather-protected canopies on the inbound and outbound platforms, a ticket office, elevators, sidewalks and lighting for pedestrians in the lot and along Myrtle Avenue.
The overall project (without a parking garage) was estimated at $16 million, Gula said.
That estimate doesn't include an additional point of access for the station – potentially through the Evraz site – that would ease congestion along Myrtle and Philadelphia Pike during peak hours. That would be a relief to Pat Bennett and other frustrated neighbors.
"People fly down that road, throw their cars in park and race to catch the train. The scary part is the school kids have to stand there at the entrance to the station to get the school bus," Bennett said.
Station advocates are frustrated by the loss of state funding, but hope to convince officials to restore that support after securing a commitment from Jostes' team.

"That's probably the better approach," said Sisson of DTC. "You don't want to spend a ton of money, then turn around and say, 'Wow, if we'd waited two years, we could have done a better development here.' "
Saddler is optimistic, noting the county is launching a study of transportation in northern Claymont, including the Tri-State Mall area and the potential spin-off effects from an expansion of a former Sunoco Refinery in Marcus Hook.
"Sales at Darley Green [community] are strong. Young professionals are moving in, and we're seeing a ripple effect in other neighborhoods in Claymont," Saddler said. "Few focus areas in the county have the potential for this much growth in such a short period of time."
Officials attempted to apply for a $1.9 million federal grant to fund the station design and environmental studies last year, but technical difficulties delayed the application, said Gula of WILMAPCO, sponsor of the application.
While the project had state and local support, it lacked a financial commitment from New Castle County and, therefore, might not have been competitive nationally. "We sent endorsement letters in, but I don't think we pulled together the matching funds," Cartier said.
The project might be a grant candidate again this year but faces competition from a Wilmington transit project, Gula said.
"We've been so behind in our transportation infrastructure funding that there's a scarcity of capital for transportation projects," said state Sen. Harris B. McDowell III, D-North Wilmington.
"The Claymont station is a primary part of the transportation system in northern Delaware. It should get done."
COMMUTER RAIL RIDERSHIP
SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line (R2) service in Delaware began operating to Wilmington in 1989, adding stops in Claymont in 1991, Newark in 1997 and Churchmans Crossing in 2000.
At Claymont, the most northern station stop in Delaware, fire destroyed the train station in the late 1980s. It was closed from 1982 to 1990, with service restored in 1991. Retrofitted bus shelters are in place on the platforms.
Weekday ridership averaged 1,120 last year. Claymont is the busiest train stop in Delaware, behind Wilmington.

A variety of current and former high-level officials have recently warned that the Bush administration is attempting to instill a dictatorship in America, and will itself carry out a fake terrorist attack in order to obtain one.
Background
FBI agents, Time Magazine, Keith Olbermann and The Washington Post and Rolling Stone have all stated that the administration has issued terror alerts based on scant intelligence in order to rally people around the flag when the administration was suffering in the polls. This implies — as an initial matter only — that the administration will play fast and loose with the facts in order to instill fear for political purposes
More to the point, a former prominent republican congressman stated that the U.S. is close to becoming a totalitarian society and that the Bush administration is using fear to try to ensure that this happens.
General Tommy Franks stated that if another terrorist attack occurs in the United States "the Constitution will likely be discarded in favor of a military form of government".
Current U.S. Congressman Ron Paul stated, the government "is determined to have martial law", and that the government is hoping to get the people "fearful enough that they will accept the man on the white horse"
And Daniel Ellsberg, the famous Pentagon Papers whistleblower, said "if there is another terror attack, "I believe the president will get what he wants", which will include a dictatorship.
Terror on U.S. Citizens by American Government?
But would the government actually kills its own people to instill sufficient fear so that it can get what it wants? Read what the following very smart people are saying, and then judge for yourself:
A retired 27-year CIA analyst who prepared and presented Presidential Daily Briefs and served as a high-level analyst for several presidents, stated that if there was another major attack in the U.S., it would lead to martial law. He went on to say:
"We have to be careful, if somebody does this kind of provocation, big violent explosions of some kind, we have to not take the word of the masters there in Washington that this was some terrorist event because it could well be a provocation allowing them, or seemingly to allow them to get what they want."
The former CIA analyst would not put it past the government to "play fast and loose" with terror alerts and warnings and even events themselves in order to rally people behind the flag
The former assistant secretary of treasury in the Reagan administration, called the "Father of Reaganomics", who is a former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, and Scripps Howard News Service, and, said:
"Ask yourself: Would a government that has lied us into two wars and is working to lie us into an attack on Iran shrink from staging "terrorist" attacks in order to remove opposition to its agenda?" He goes on to say:
If the Bush administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle East and to entrench the "unitary executive" at home, it will have to conduct some false flag operations that will both frighten and anger the American people and make them accept Bush's declaration of "national emergency" and the return of the draft. Alternatively, the administration could simply allow any real terrorist plot to proceed without hindrance. A series of staged or permitted attacks would be spun by the captive media as a vindication of the neoconsevatives' Islamophobic policy, the intention of which is to destroy all Middle Eastern governments that are not American puppet states. Success would give the US control over oil, but the main purpose is to eliminate any resistance to Israel's complete absorption of Palestine into Greater Israel. Think about it. If another 9/11-type "security failure" were not in the works, why would Homeland Security czar Chertoff go to the trouble of convincing the Chicago Tribune that Americans have become complacent about terrorist threats and that he has "a gut feeling" that America will soon be hit hard?
A member of the British Parliament stated that "there is a very real danger" that the American government will stage a false flag terror attack in order to justify war against Iran and to gain complete control domestically
A former National Security Adviser told the Senate that a terrorist act might be carried out in the U.S. and falsely blamed on Iran to justify war against that nation.
President Carter recently impliedly acknowledged the risk of staged provocation in order to start a war against Iran.
The former UN Weapons Inspector, an American, who stated before the Iraq war started that there were no weapons of mass destruction is now saying that he would not rule out staged government terror by the U.S. government.
And an allegedly-leaked GOP memo touts a new terror attack as a way to reverse the party's decline.
No way, That's Nuts
Sounds nuts, right?
Sorry to have to tell you, but "false flag terror" -- that is, state-sponsored terrorism, blamed on the "bad guys" of choice -- is an age-old trick which has been used by governments around the world for thousands of years to consolidate power and create support from their people. See this article on the Reichstag fire, and this article on the perennial ploy of those grabbing power.
But even recent events provide a glimpse into the world of false flag terror:
On October 12, 2005, Australia's largest newspaper quoted the well-respected former Indonesian president as saying that the government had a role in the Bali bombings
And Americans dressed as Arabs have apparently been setting off car bombs in Iraq (apparently, when it was discovered that some of the cars used in Iraqi bombings recently came from the U.S., the cover story became American cars were involved in car bombings only because they had recently been stolen from the U.S. and then shipped to Iraq -- but does it make sense that Iraqi insurgents would steal cars in the U.S. and ship them all the way to Iraq?)
Similarly, Britain's false flag attacks in Iraq made the news. And the press has acknowledged that the death of the lead investigator into the Basra incident was mysterious.
And the former director of the National Security Agency said "By any measure the US has long used terrorism. In ‘78-79 the Senate was trying to pass a law against international terrorism - in every version they produced, the lawyers said the US would be in violation"(the audio is here)
History proves that the officials' warnings of a terror attack by our own government are well-founded.
OK, it's the NYT, and it's about Hillary Clinton, so take it with a grain of salt, but if true this is some kind of stupid all right:
If Hillary Rodham Clinton's new apology for her private email server fails to reassure jittery supporters, it could amplify the chatter among some Democrats who have been casting about for a potential white knight to rescue the party from a beleaguered Clinton candidacy. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Al Gore: Each has been discussed among party officials in recent weeks as an alternative to Mrs. Clinton if she does not regain her once-dominant standing in the 2016 presidential field and instead remains mired in the long-running email controversy, with its attendant investigations.... It is not just Mrs. Clinton's weakness in the polls that has generated talk of other alternatives, but also the strength of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is routinely drawing huge crowds at campaign events. That has been disconcerting to Democratic officials who believe that Mr. Sanders, a socialist, is so liberal that his presence at the top of the party's ticket in 2016 would be disastrous. “If party leaders see a scenario next winter where Bernie Sanders has a real chance at the Democratic nomination, I think there's no question that leaders will reach out to Vice President Biden or Secretary of State Kerry or even Gore about entering the primaries,” said Garnet F. Coleman, a Texas state lawmaker and Democratic national committeeman.
“As Democratic Party officials see Bernie Sanders's mounting strength with voters, I think they will begin to better understand that he will not only be a strong nominee who can help Democrats all across the country win elections, but he actually will be the white knight if they need one,” said Mr. Devine...
Bernie Sanders' senior advisor Tad Devine thinks that Democratic party officials will come around and give his guy a chance when they see just how good Sanders is in the televised debates and realize his strengths:I wouldn't bet on it, Mr Devine. These people want nothing more than the losers they know and love, proven presidential losers like Biden, Kerry, and Gore.
The last thing they want is a strong nominee who might shake up the party and bring in new voters -- voters attracted by someone running on real and popular Democratic policies instead of on the threadbare warmongering neo-liberal crap they've been trying to peddle to voters for the past generation.
They'd rather lose than have to admit that it's time for a change.
One thing is sure about the fire service - we have a variety of methods for delivering emergency medical care. There are over 50 delivery models, with the fire service playing a key component in most of those models. You can have basic life support (BLS) engines doing first response with BLS fire department transport, or you can have BLS engines doing first response with advanced life support (ALS) fire department transport.
Another two models are ALS engines doing first response with BLS or ALS fire department transport. But the key to the more recent models is the concept of ALS engines. However, be mindful, in some departments, ALS is not limited to engines. Some departments have truck companies, squads and quints that are ALS capable.
The roots of using engine companies for first response can probably be traced back to the 1970s TV series "Emergency." The delivery model in the series typically would show paramedic/firefighters assigned to a rescue unit delivering ALS care, supported by a four-person engine company. Besides bringing what was typically emergency room care to the side of the patient, viewers saw an engine company used in a non-fire role. This approach was adopted by many communities virtually overnight.
The concept of delivering ALS from engines can take on several names - ALS engines, paramedic engines or assessment engines. Even the concept can take on different meanings in different communities. The term ALS or paramedic engines in some communities has been applied to anything beyond "first-aid" capable, all the way up to carrying everything an ALS ambulance would carry except the stretcher. What may be considered a paramedic engine in one community would not be considered an assessment engine in another community.
Taking it a step further, some fire departments have combined concepts and developed transport-capable engines or ladders. The concept of using engines as ALS first responders makes sense. Most communities have a low incidence of fires while they respond to an exorbitantly high number of EMS calls. Even then, those fires are usually small and quickly extinguished by one handline.
Some communities developed ALS companies because of economics. By upgrading an existing engine company to the paramedic level, a fire department can eliminate hiring additional personnel, buying another vehicle (ambulance), and the additional fuel and maintenance costs associated with running an ambulance while still providing ALS service. The startup costs can easily save a fire department over $200,000.
Some departments run with the configuration of one EMT and one paramedic on the ambulance and a minimum of one paramedic on the engine company. Thus, the department has ALS first response and ALS transport. If the patient is critical, the paramedic on the engine company accompanies the paramedic from the ambulance to the hospital while the EMT assigned to the ambulance drives.
In some cases fire departments upgraded engine companies to ALS-capable to increase service levels and upgrade performance. In the case where the first-response company is ALS this theory advocates "front-loaded ALS" delivery, possibly allowing the ambulance to take longer responding to the scene. Studies done by the American Heart Association have shown improved survival rates in cardiac-arrest victims when ALS intervention time is shortened.
Another component to increasing service levels occurred in some communities when an engine company's response district was remote from the closest ALS ambulance because of geographics. To compensate for this deficiency, some departments converted the engine to ALS capable, to compensate for the prolonged response time of an ALS ambulance.
Private ambulance companies that have a public/private cooperative with a fire department also like the concept of paramedic engines. Under their management concepts, the cost and risk of providing ALS is shifted to the fire service.
Obviously, there are costs - drugs and monitor-defibrillators, for example - associated with maintaining ALS equipment that departments would not otherwise incur. Additionally, some private companies have advocated prolonging their response times because ALS is already being delivered by the fire department. The standard for the private industry has been to arrive on a scene within eight minutes and 59 seconds, 90% of the time. But with the introduction of ALS engines, some private companies have negotiated for and received up to 14 minutes and 59 seconds, 90% of the time. This "cost-shifting" to the fire service can add up to significant profit for private-ambulance companies.
The other benefit to the private-ambulance industry with ALS engines is the "risk-shifting" that occurs when the fire service assumes the ALS component of delivery. Obviously, there are risks associated with providing advanced treatment, including wrong medications, intubating the esophagus or other risk procedures that can lead to lawsuits.
The ever-increasing role fire departments have taken on with respect to providing EMS should be a clear sign that EMS should not be segregated, but integrated into the department. EMS being delivered by a fire department significantly increases that department's visibility to the public. This visibility and increased productivity certainly provide momentum for strong community support.
Republicans may be tirelessly working to rebrand their party since losing last year's race for the White House, but a recent slew of state initiatives to restrict access to abortion isn't doing this effort any favors – and may only widen the party's so-called "gender gap" in attracting women voters.
Indeed, while conservatives celebrate Texas' early-morning passage of a high-profile bill that bans most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and places new requirements on which facilities can perform the procedure, liberals are once again railing against the party for its so-called "war on women."
Yet despite the risk of alienating female voters, the campaigns have undoubtedly energized conservatives, particularly opponents of abortion rights who compose a cornerstone of the Republican base. And conservatives argue that polling suggests that most Americans – including most women – favor limiting late-term abortions.
Despite Wendy Davis' dramatic filibuster delaying Texas' abortion bill, the Republican-dominated Texas legislature is expected to support the measure which would ban most abortions for women more than 20 weeks pregnant. Just this year, 17 states passed new measures impacting abortion. NBC's Kate Snow reports.
“Rhetorically, this can be really hard,” said Liz Mair, a Republican strategist. For the efforts to work to their benefit, party leaders need to "figure out what [they're] going to say, and test it out in advance," she said, "and not by talking to committed pro-lifers.”
The wider movement, reignited in part by the murder conviction of Philadelphia abortion provider Kermit Gosnell, has found Republicans on Capitol Hill and across the country looking to follow Texas' path in restricting access after 20 weeks.
“I think [the push] in fact helps, because one of the reasons Republicans haven't done well in the past few cycles is because the base hasn't turned out and been energized,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, an Arkansas-based Republican strategist.
The challenge of wooing women voters
Conservative enthusiasm aside, the movement comes in the face of a real, proven struggle for the GOP to attract women voters. For as much hand-wringing consultants did after the 2012 election about Republicans' deficit among Hispanic voters, the party's struggles with women were nearly as damaging. President Barack Obama beat rival Mitt Romney by 11 points among women voters, who made up 53 percent of the electorate, according to national exit polls.
Democrats drove that wedge in part by successfully seizing upon examples – a bill in Virginia to require transvaginal ultrasounds before an abortion, or Missouri Rep. Todd Akin's comments about “legitimate rape” – of Republicans seeming hopelessly out-of-touch with women.
The experience prompted Republicans to vow to speak more softly on social issues and promote women within the party. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., crafted a series of legislative proposals that seemed poll-tested to appeal to suburban soccer moms.
But some House conservatives balked at Cantor's measures, forcing the No. 2 Republican to shelve some of his initiatives. And the talk about a softer tone toward social issues gave way to the new abortion restrictions in some states – North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas – and in Congress, where the House passed a law to effectively ban most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. (There are rumblings that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio may champion a similar measure in the Senate.)
Senator Wendy Davis (D-TX) speaks at a women's rights rally before a Special Session of the Texas Legislature, telling the crowd, "I don't regret for one minute my decisions about my daughters, my education, or my direction in life ... and that's what we are fighting for now."
Three of the states that have passed new abortion measures were swing states that were heavily contested in the 2012 presidential election. And the fourth state, Texas, has attracted widespread attention for the actions of state Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis to initially block the Lone Star state's proposal.
The attention these battles have generated has made Democrats downright giddy.
“These are like layups on a five-foot rim,” said Brad Woodhouse, the president of the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change. “I think the way that they're conducting themselves gives me more hope for the immediate political consequences than I'd had they followed through on what they said they'd do after the election.”
Can the GOP change its face?
The prevailing fear among some Republicans is that these measures make the GOP seem unduly focused on abortion. And moreover, the party has too often relied on old, white men as their messengers in these fights.
Huckabee Sanders, the Republican strategist who favors the legislation passed by the varying states, warned against letting “old, white guys” become the face of the abortion argument.
“I think that people like me and my peers need to be more aggressive about getting out there and talking about the issues,” she said.
And conservatives also argue that concerns about their legislation closing most abortion clinics are largely overstated anyway.
It's also important to note that these fights are playing out early in 2013; Akin and Mourdock's impolitic comments came at the height of a presidential election season, when even the most benign remark can be instantaneously amplified into a national controversy.
“We know midterms are different than presidential elections. So there may be a strategy related to this based on what voters they think might turn out in the midterm,” Woodhouse conceded. That's not to mention that many of the Senate seats Democrats must defend in 2014 fall on more reliably Republican turf, and House seats have largely been drawn to protect GOP incumbents.
But, he added: “If they weren't already shrinking at a party based on where they were on immigration and other issues, they're certainly not doing any favors.”

Today's question: The Washington Redskins had a dangerous passing attack with 1,000-yard receivers DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. With both players now elsewhere, how dangerous will the Redskins' passing game be with their replacements, Terrelle Pryor Sr. and Josh Doctson?
Todd Archer, Dallas Cowboys reporter: I liked the Pryor signing because he still has something to prove. Doctson's rookie year was really a wash, so I wouldn't presume that he will put up numbers of a Jackson or Garcon. I think their experience and savvy helped Kirk Cousins a lot. He will need time to get on the same page with these two guys, whereas the other two receivers knew the ins and outs of the offense and the rest of the division too. But I think we need to remember Jordan Reed when discussing the Washington passing game. His value goes up exponentially without Jackson and Garcon. He is a matchup worry for just about every team and can help make up for the absences.
Jordan Raanan, New York Giants reporter: Consider me skeptical. Reed is a stud when healthy. Jamison Crowder is an up-and-comer as well. But Pryor and Doctson should have the Redskins petrified. Doctson produced close to nothing his rookie season in large part because of injuries. Who knows if he can play, much less stays healthy. Pryor, meanwhile, was allowed to walk, and his market wasn't what was expected in free agency. Jackson and Garcon produced over 2,000 yards receiving last season. It's hard for me to see that as a realistic possibility for Pryor and Doctson.
Tim McManus, Philadelphia Eagles reporter: I think this is a healthy change for Washington overall. Garcon and Jackson are both 30, and it's probably a smart move not to overspend for players on the back end of their careers, particularly if you can replenish the position with some younger talent. I'm a Pryor fan, and after listening to some NFL defensive coaches talk about him, I know that he earned a lot of respect last season. I believe he'll do well. Doctson is more of an unknown because of the Achilles injury that took away much of his rookie year, but he clearly has first-round ability. While I think there will be some growing pains here that could equal an overall drop in receiver production from a year ago, this will still be a group that needs to be respected.
This is a short article on how to get an IMEI number from a MEID or ESN, which should be the same. For a lot of people, this can be found within the device. But there will be times when a device will just not show this information.
Why Do I Need This?
As stated above, most of the time an IMEI can be easily found in your device settings. Other times you may even be able to find this printed on the back of a device. However, there will be times that neither provide an IMEI.
As for what it is needed for, most of us would have to give it to a carrier to register our device on a network before we can use the network. There may be other reasons, but this would be the most common.
For Me
I recently had an issue with a brand-new LG G5 (US992) device that comes factory unlocked, but is branded for US Cellular. There was nothing on the back, and the settings only showed an MEID and ESN.
Reading through some forum threads, some people stated that popping in a GSM SIM card would allow me to see an IMEI in the settings if the device was on a CDMA network previously. The LG G5 had been on US Cellular for about two days, so maybe this was a simple solution. But after putting in a GSM SIM card, nothing changed...
Luhn's Algorithm
Math. Math is the solution here. If you have either the MEID or ESN, you have the ability to calculate your IMEI.
An MEID or ESN will be 14 digits, while an IMEI will be 15 digits. The IMEI will have the same first 14 digits as an MEID or ESN, with a final 15th digit called a check digit. Luhn's algorithm is a way to obtain that 15th digit. It is a public domain algorithm commonly used today for numerous devices.
The Math
I will give you a simple visual showing of how it is done. We will first write out our MEID:
12345678912345
You will then double every second digit of the MEID:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5
1 4 3 8 5 12 7 16 9 2 2 6 4 10
Add up all the digits as though they were all single numbers:
1 4 3 8 5 12 7 16 9 2 2 6 4 10
1+4
+
3
+
8

+
7
+
1
+6
+
9
+
2
+
2
+
6
+
4
+
1
+
0=62
Now add to the summed number until it is divisible by 10 and results in a whole number:
62+8=70
70/10=7
The number that we added to the 62 is our check digit:
8
Our IMEI would then be:
123456789123458
This is just an example, but shows exactly how one would use a real MEID/ESN to calculate the 15th digit (to get the IMEI).
Does It Work?
I have used this during two occasions. The first was for my LG G5, and I was able to validate it through an IMEI checker, which did display the correct LG G5 variant--and was later sold to a customer with that IMEI, and who has not complained since our transaction.
The second occasion was during a job that required activating phones at times. I had an elderly customer who did not have the IMEI but provided the ESN to me. Following the formula above, I calculated his 15th digit and was able to confirm that his device was fully activated.
Nintendo Wii U flaunts its ports
Nintendo has been pretty cautious with what it shows of its Wii U console: our own Vincent Nguyen got into trouble at E3 last week for getting too close to the behind-glass unit in our hands-on. Inside Games Japan managed to score a little extra eyes-on time, however, with some live shots of the sides and back – including ports – of the Wii U.
There are no great surprises to be found, beyond two USB ports and an HDMI output. A further two USB ports are expected to be under the flap at the front. Nintendo has frustrated some by leaving out an ethernet port, though the Wii U will have WiFi integrated. More spec detail here.
Right now it looks like Nintendo is envisaging the Wii U be used lying flat in your entertainment center – it's a little longer than the original Wii, though – rather than standing up. Still, that's nothing a snap-on stand couldn't address.
Cooling is via a relatively small fan, though given the console is already confirmed to use a Radeon HD 4000 series GPU, reports Game Watch, which is based on 2008 architecture, that shouldn't be too great a problem. The GPU – believed to be similar to the Radeon HD 4890 – will still make the Wii U more powerful graphically than either the Xbox 360 or PS3; developers with early access to the console have suggested it will be around 50-percent faster than Sony or Microsoft's current-gen hardware.
We'll have to wait a while to see exactly how that shapes up in terms of gameplay. Despite the extra grunt on paper, Nintendo has admitted that it used stock Xbox 360 and PS3 gaming footage for its E3 showreel since the Wii U hardware is still a year out from readiness. Still, check out our hands-on for more details, video, and what gaming was possible on the new Nintendo.

Samsung has announced that the Galaxy S III will receive a Premium Suite update. The software upgrade is intended to bring across features originally found on the Galaxy Note II, including Multi Window and Page Buddy. The former will allow you to open two different apps at the same time by splitting the screen in two — users will be able to navigate the browser and an email client simultaneously, for example. Page Buddy, meanwhile, intelligently opens apps depending on the actions you take. If you plug in a pair of headphones, Page Buddy will move you across to a new homescreen where a music player will be waiting,
Other features include contextual menus, contextual tags for photos, and a Facebook news ticker for the lockscreen. NFC functionality will see a slight tweak too, with the new Auto Share Shot Pairing mode allowing users to beam any new photos or videos to another NFC-capable device as soon as they're taken. Right now the update looks to be for the international model of the Galaxy S III, and Samsung says further rollouts and availability will depend on individual carriers.
Update: Samsung has released Part II of its overview of the Premium Suite upgrade for the Galaxy S III. New features demonstrated here include a low-light shot mode in the camera; a Best Face mode in the camera that works in a similar fashion to features offered by Nokia Lumia smartphone the upcoming BlackBerry 10 platform to make sure everyone is smiling in your pictures; a new Setup Wizard; Easy Mode for smartphone beginners; and more. Check out the video below for a detailed look at these features.

2016 could be called the year of Artificial Intelligence: from better improved Data Analytics, to Smart Homes, Cars, and more. Every day seemed like the world of tech was making a step closer to true AI, like AI comes a little step closer to being human. Who knows, within the next 10 years we could have something approaching a real life WestWorld!
AI is taking over the world, to the point where our developers are surprised when a project doesn't involve AI or Machine Learning to one extent or another. But AI is so diverse a term that it can be (and is) applied to any industry, sector, business, etc. So, to celebrate the end of 2016, and to bring in the New Year, we thought we'd cover the biggest areas AI impacted in 2016. Plus, we'll cover where each area stands today, and what may lie in wait for 2017.
Digital Assistants
AI for Virtual Personal Assistants run the Gamut:
1. Smart Home;
a. This includes Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Both services provide a central location for you to access every aspect of your SmartHome. When you throw in system's like Mark Zuckerberg's Jarvis, you get what is essentially a Live-in Digital Butler.
b. Other takes on this include Asus Zenbo, which is like Echo, Home, or Jarvis but moves around the house and uses a digital display to show facial expressions and emotion.
Smart Business
2. Softbank Pepper is a Japanese robot that looks like a half formed albino Cyberman (obligatory Dr. Who is a shoutout!). Despite its half wax appearance, Pepper uses Natural Language Processes (NLP) to understand human speech AND body language (including gestures). Already, Pepper is being demoed in retail stores as a Sales Assistant.
3. Otto Trucks turn ordinary semi trucks into Smart Vehicles capable of driving themselves. Similar to Google's Self Driving cars, these Smart Trucks use AI to help them make complicated decisions, faster than a human can. These trucks can also change routes to optimize for efficiencies.
4. Aethon Tug and Fetch Robotics both use AI to help retrieve objects that their users need. Tug's emphasis is on the Medical industry and is trained to deliver supplies and medicine to Patients. Fetch works in warehouses, following workers around. When a worker needs something the robot can lift it off the shelves and carry it around for them.
Drones
5. We're starting to move beyond the view that Drones are terrifying heralds of death, (and even beyond them being a tool for creepy stalkers) to having true effectiveness in this area. Amazon is diving headfirst into this and made headlines recently with their drone delivery system. But Amazon is taking it a step further, with recent plans to potentially launch “Airborne Fulfilment Centers” (AFC).
These AFCs are planned to be giant floating warehouse deployed over cities during times of high need (we're pretty sure Amazon isn't trying to take over the world, but sometimes you've got to wonder). From the patents Amazon filed, it appears that these will use complex Machine Learning algorithms and a complicated Drone Delivery System. The purpose behind these AFCs is to add more value to their business and it brings them into more direct competition with Brick and Mortar Retailers (as does their other project, Amazon Go).
6. But Drones are being built for all types of research. AI and Machine Learning algorithms help programmers create code that has never been before possible. This leads us to my personal favorite Robot on this list, Boston Dynamic's SpotMini. SpotMini is a research drone: it was built to help scientists in a lab. The drone uses sensors and cameras to help it see, but it's the greatest resource to a scientist is its precise grasping and holding motions. Most robots 5 years ago couldn't even hold a mug without shattering it. SpotMini can not only pick up, hold and move about with a glass, but it can do it with something as delicate as a wine glass.
7. DJ Mavic Pro is a drone is going to take the place of Action Sports Reporters. Using an exceptionally complicated series of sensors and Artificial Intelligence to be able to make instant mid flight corrections to avoid objects in it's way; and this is in free movement, not a preplanned flight. This makes it excellent for capturing Action Sports, from tracking a baseball mid-flight to following cross country runners.
So what does this mean for 2017? Well, obviously the first thing is you can't avoid AI anymore. It's more than just a passing fancy. It is quite literally changing the foundation of not just the world of business, but everything about our lives. We're at a tipping point, where historians will look back and point to this era as when it all began.
The question you need to be asking is: can your business afford to be late to this game? Can you afford to ignore this tipping point in history and continue operating business as usual.
The good news is that SDI has spent the last few years preparing for this point, and we have the tools to modernize any business. Still working on turning your idea into a business? Give us a call at 408.802.2885/408.621.8481 and we can discuss how AI can turn your idea into a thriving business. Not a phone person? No problem, our can contact us digitally as well.

The woman claiming to have witnessed the murder of Senator Harry Reid's great nephew is speaking out only to News 3 after the District Attorney dropped charges against the man responsible for Lamar Reid Jr's death.
"I'm shocked and disgusted. I can't believe it. I believe it's a horrible injustice,” said Leah Hernandez, the victim's girlfriend.
Leah Hernandez wonders "why" her former roommate Michael Lanunziata is a free man.
She tells us, she witnessed Lanunziata murder her boyfriend, 22-year-old Lamar Reid Jr.
RELATED |
The shooting happened on August 27th at a Henderson townhouse off of East Paradise Hills and Interstate 515.
“Michael pulled out his gun and started shooting. I screamed stop your killing him and he kept on shooting,” said Hernandez.
District Attorney, Steve Wolfson, spoke about the case. He says Lanunziata actions are consistent with self-defense.

Wolfson also tells us the physical evidence does not show murder and that Hernandez told Henderson Police that Lamar Reid Jr. had done not have a weapon.
"The crime scene itself shows the presence of a knife found. I believe under the body of the decedent which is 100-percent consistent with what the defendant claimed,” said District Attorney Wolfson.
Hernandez says Lanunziata broke into the townhome and started yelling.
“The police looked at the physical evidence and there was no sign of a forced entry. Again inconsistent with what the other eyewitness said,” District Attorney Wolfson.
Hernandez tells us she now fears for her life.
“The only peace I found in any of this, is that Michael would spend the rest of his life in prison. That's where he deserves to be. That's where he should be,” said Hernandez.
"We have an obligation to only file charges in cases we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt and in this case, we didn't feel we could,” said District Attorney Wolfson.
MAY 14: The Braves announced that Minor underwent shoulder surgery today to repair the labrum in his shoulder. As David O'Brien of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution tweets, initial MRIs didn't reveal a tear in the labrum, but upon undergoing exploratory surgery, Dr. Neal ElAttrache did indeed find damage in the labrum, which has now been prepared. The Braves' press release indicated that Minor is expected to be ready for the 2016 season.
MAY 12: Braves left-hander Mike Minor will undergo surgery on his left shoulder that will likely end his season, reports Bill Shanks of FOX Sports 1670 and Scout.com. MLB.com's Mark Bowman adds that the surgery will take place this week (Twitter link).
Minor, 27, landed on the 60-day disabled list earlier this month and had yet to show “measurable improvement” as of that report. The former No. 7 overall pick has not pitched this season and spent a portion of the 2014 season on the shelf due to inflammation in his left shoulder as well. That injury led to a diminished performance in terms of both bottom-line results (4.77 ERA) and time spent on the field (145 1/3 innings), but Minor still topped the Braves in an arbitration hearing this offseason, netting a $5.6MM salary. (Atlanta had filed at $5.1MM.)
Minor's rather significant arbitration earnings cloud his future with the Braves. Last December, the Braves cut bait on both Brandon Beachy and Kris Medlen, non-tendering the pair rather than paying similar salaries to the ones they earned in their lost 2014 campaigns. Of course, both of those right-handers were recovering from Tommy John surgery, not shoulder surgery, so the situations are not entirely similar. Medlen and Beachy were both going through their second Tommy John, and it was known that they would be out through the early portion of summer, at least. While shoulder problems are often actually more severe for pitchers than Tommy John, we don't yet know the type of procedure that Minor will undergo, and therefore it's impossible to know specifically what kind of timeline will come along with his rehab.
With Minor absent from the rotation, Eric Stults and spring trade acquisition Trevor Cahill joined Julio Teheran, Alex Wood and Shelby Miller in the rotation to begin the season. However, Cahill's early struggles have led to a bullpen role and a rotation audition for the highly touted Mike Foltynewicz, who was acquired from Houston in the Evan Gattis trade.
The European Union is committed to working with those who support the reform process underlying the Association Agreement in Moldova. It is especially referred to combating corruption and hidden interests, irrespective of political affiliation, the independence of the judiciary and the depoliticization of the institutions of the state.
In a press release broadcast after the parliamentary elections, it is mentioned that the EU will continue to build relations with the Republic of Moldova on the principle of conditionality and respect for the rule of law and democratic standards.
According to quoted sources, the European Union has closely monitored the entire electoral process, including the campaign and the Election Day, and will continue to carefully follow the post-electoral evolutions in order to assess its impact on democracy and pluralism in the Republic of Moldova.
“These were the first elections in the new mixed electoral system. As already mentioned in the Council Conclusions of 26 February 2018, most of the significant changes to the Electoral Code in 2017 were not in line with some of the key recommendations of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe and the OSCE / ODIHR. The conduct of these last elections confirmed the need to follow these recommendations and to continue efforts to align the electoral legislation and its implementation to international standards,” the quoted source says.
It also shows that the European Union's partnership with the Republic of Moldova will continue to focus on providing tangible benefits to Moldovan citizens.
Before we begin, we should figure out what kind of project you're creating. I've never seen anyone write about this topic before but it's important.
There are two types of projects you will do as a designer, mockup work and real work. Because they have different end goals, the types of images you can use for each are different. This can actually be liberating as you'll see.
1) Mockups
Mockup designs are never intended for a mass audience. Because of this, you can grab and use images from almost anywhere. As long as the final pieces will only be used for a client pitch or for your own private portfolio, it's ok*. Some companies like Getty Images encourage this by giving agencies access to high resolution images in their catalog. Getty figures that if their images are used in a successful pitch, there's a good chance the designer will want to purchase it for the real project. Often that's true.
Here are some types of mockup work:
Class assignments
When designers first come out of design school the majority of their portfolio consists of class assignments. This may also include self-assigned projects if you're out of school. Here's a little secret: some of the great work you see on Dribbble and other portfolio sites wasn't really client work, it was done for self-promotion.
Unpaid Pitches
This is when the client invites you to pitch your ideas with the understanding that if you do a great job, you'll win their business. It's usually a limited scope of work. If you're pitching a website, you might design the homepage and three or four other pages. If you win the pitch then you can go and actually build it. Unpaid pitch work is more common in advertising, and designers sometimes do it too, but generally they have a strong resistance to it.
Paid Pitches
I've been at some places where the client will pay for a limited amount of creative work to see if they like what you come up. Here the client relationship is usually more established and no other firms are competing for the business. It's not quite pitch work because the agency gets paid, but it's not a real project either.
Here are some of my favorite places to get imagery when doing mockups:
Bernstein & Andriulli
This is my go-to site. This is a rep for some amazing photographers. The images are nice and big. You can search by category at the top and the lifestyle section in particular is excellent.
Trunk Archive
This is a little more high fashion. They have a pretty good search tool and you can also filter the images by orientation (horizontal or vertical).
Google Images
Seriously! You can leverage the tastes of certain publications to find Illustrators. For example if I knew I needed a really good infographic, I'd do a Google image search for “GOOD magazine infographic”. They do great infographics so by perusing their old work, I might find an Illustrator I like.
“Monocle magazine illustrator” is another good search term.
Recently I Googled “New York Times editorial illustrator” and discovered the work of Andrew Colin Beck. I then used his work in some designs I did for a pitch. The client loved his style so much that we hired him to do Illustrations for the entire site.
One final word on having mockup work in your portfolio. I've noticed the advertising world has less of a tolerance for it than the design industry. I think it's because a large part of advertising is convincing the client to buy your idea. So if you show work that wasn't actually made, it's less impressive. So if you're creating work for any audience besides ad people, I say go for it!
2) Real work Real projects are those which have a launch date set and you're the one to design it. A large audience is likely to see it. Because you're using other people's creative work you're more limited in what imagery you can use. Here are some great places to find great imagery for real work:
Stocksy
Cost: $Stocksy is one of the first places I go when designing a real site. Their photos have an authenticity that is often missing from traditional stock photography websites.
The Noun Project
Cost: $This is a great place to find icons. They're free with accreditation, or a dollar or two without.
Unsplash
Cost: freeBeautiful images are that mostly nature themed. High-res and completely free!
Death to Stock
Cost: freeThese guys send out a monthly email with images. You can't search for stuff on their site but the emails have good stuff in them.
Superfamous
Cost: Free + attributionThey have lots of nature photos.
Getty
Cost: $$$I'll occasionally find decent photos on Getty because of it's sheer size. There is some bad " stocky " stuff on there too so you just have to be discerning.
Hopefully these resources will help the next time you need to find imagery!
The full text of the House Republicans tax plan is finally here, and the media have been bubbling over with hot takes on who wins and who loses under the proposal. For my money, the biggest loser is California Gov. Jerry Brown. Because the bill eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, Brown's fantasy of a California free of gas-powered autos has come to a screeching halt.
The tax bill would zero out the Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Credit after 2017. First put into effect in 2010, this tax credit gives a $7,500 credit to purchasers of full-electric vehicles such as Teslas and Chevy Volts. Lesser tax credits are also available for hybrids.
That's bad news for Brown, who has leaned heavily on the federal tax credit to achieve his ambitious goal of electrifying the Golden State's roadways.
Back in 2012, Brown set a goal of having 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) on the road by 2025. Since then, he has reportedly suggested going even farther and banning gas-powered cars outright.
The governor has already spent a bundle of his state's money trying to rev up Californians' demand for electric vehicles. Since Brown's inauguration in 2011, California has handed out $463 million in tax rebates for hybrid and electric vehicle purchases, and it has spent another $80 million on the charging infrastructure needed to support them.
Those are just the carrots. California has also deployed the stick to get people out of their gas guzzlers, hiking the gas tax by a full 12 cents a gallon this month and tightening what were already strict vehicle emissions standards.
Yet despite all these efforts, California's fleet of electric vehicles remains tiny. Only 300,000 plug-in electric vehicles have been sold in the state, and only about 150,000 of those could be considered zero-emission. That's compared to the roughly 35 million registered vehicles in California.
If Republicans succeed in getting rid of the feds' $7,500 tax credit for ZEVs—which far outstrips California's additional $2,500 rebate for the same product—Brown will have to devote far more of the state's resources toward reaching 1.5 million ZEVs by 2025.
California is already spending $140 million a year on tax rebates for hybrid and electric vehicles, enough to provide 56,000 people with full-ZEV tax credits. If the federal tax credit were to go away, Brown would have to spend another $420 million to maintain the same subsidies for those 56,000 prospective buyers.
Electric car manufacturers, who sell about half of their electrical vehicle fleet in California, can see the writing on the wall, with many issuing statements urging Congress to reverse course on eliminating the tax credit.
"Tax credits are an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles," General Motors said in a statement. The Electric Drive Transportation Association, a trade group, echoed the sentiment, expressing its deep disappointment at Republicans' proposal to "prematurely end this critical incentive."
Brown himself has expressed outrage at the proposal, saying it "transfers income from individuals and families to large and powerful corporate structures. This is bad economic policy and bad for the American people."
It's an ironic response from the governor, given that Brown's electric car fantasies rely on a federal tax credit that does the same thing, redirecting wealth from individual taxpayers to subsidize electric vehicle sales for large and powerful corporations.
There is no need for the nation's taxpayers to subsidize this mess. Whatever its faults, the Republicans' tax bill is right to bump the breaks on tax credits for electric vehicles.

L'ha uccisa dopo averla minacciata per giorni e giorni. Non poteva sopportare di essere stato lasciato. Un episodio di violenza contro le donne reso - se possibile - ancor più agghiacciante dall'età dell'omicida e della sua vittima: 15 anni. Lui, accusato formalmente di omicidio, è un profugo afgano entrato in Germania come minore non accompagnato lo scorso anno. Una vicenda destinata ad alimentare le pulsioni xenofobe in un Paese già in tensione per la crescente porzione di tedeschi che alle elezioni del 24 settembre ha votato per l'estrema destra di Alternative fuer Deutscland, mentre ancora non riesce a darsi un governo.
E' il drammatico epilogo di un amore tra adolescenti che per lui si è evidentemente trasformato in qualcosa di più. Ieri al termine di una lite, ha accoltellato a morte la sua ex fidanzata, in un centro commerciale a Kandel, con una lama di 20 cm. Intorno a loro c'erano una ventina di persone, tra cui due amici della ragazza che non sono riusciti a fermare l'assassino, ma lo hanno bloccato fino all'arrivo della polizia. Il profugo afgano 15enne - riferisce il Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung - è stato incriminato per omicidio preterintenzionale. Secondo il procuratore di Ludwigshafen, Angelika Moehlig, l'assassino e la vittima si sarebbero incontrati casualmente mercoledì nel centro commerciale. In quanto minore, il ragazzo rischia al massimo una condanna a 10 anni di detenzione.
Un delitto sul quale pesano drammaticamente anche elementi di premeditazione: il padre della vittima alcune settimana fa aveva denunciato alla polizia il 15enne per minacce e insulti, sia al telefono che sui social network, dopo che da un paio di mesi la relazione con sua figlia era finita.
Il ragazzo, di cui non è stata rivelata l'identità, è registrato come richiedente asilo dall'aprile 2016 a Francoforte. Ha ricevuto la scolarizzazione in Germania ed è stato assegnato a un centro di accoglienza nella regione. Era entrato in Germania nell'aprile del 2016 ed era stato inserito in un centro di accoglienza a Germersheime, nel Land della Renania-Palatinato, dove si trova la città di Kandel teatro dell'omicidio. Qui l'adolescente afgano ha vissuto fino a settembre, per poi essere spostato in una casa sociale a Neustadt, 25 km a nord di Kandel. Non solo. Il ragazzo era noto alla polizia perché sospettato di un'aggressione nella scuola che frequentava: dopo essere stato insultato, durante la ricreazione aveva dato un pugno a un compagno.
I ministro dell'Interno del Land, il social democratico Roger Lewentz, e la titolare della Famiglia, la verde Anne Spiegel, hanno insieme dichiarato che il governo della Renania-Palatinato "è colpito da questo atto terribile". Più duro il portavoce del gruppo social democratico al Bundestag, Burkhard Lischka, che ha chiesto l'espulsione del giovane dal Paese: "Questo è possibile sia in base al diritto internazionale che alle leggi tedesche". Il presidente degli xenofobi di AfD, Joerg Meuthen, ha stigmatizzato che cose come queste "non possono continuare a succedere nel nostro Paese", puntando il dito contro la cancelliera Merkel.
In less than a year, the Republican Party—whose presidential candidates I have supported since 2004—has transformed itself into an ugly, snarling, bigoted faction beyond recognition. By nominating Donald Trump for president and working toward his successful election, the party's leaders and voters made themselves complicit in not only the greatest Russian espionage operation since the Rosenbergs pilfered nuclear secrets but the egotistical psychodrama of an authoritarian race-baiting man-child. In retrospect, the signs that the Republican Party might one day be hijacked by such a dangerous figure were clear, John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate—and the GOP base's enthusiastic embrace of her resentful stupidity—offering the prime example. I spoke early and often, in this space and elsewhere, about the threat Trump posed to the republic and the free world, but to no avail.
Now that Trump and his enablers have effectively taken over the GOP, it is the Democratic Party's future that's at stake. Democrats must understand that being in opposition doesn't mean that their responsibility is simply to fight the administration without paying attention to the condition of their own party. That, indeed, was the mistake Republicans made throughout the Obama years by giving free reign to the most irresponsible and reactionary voices, which is how they, and we, ended up with Trump.
Jewish Democrats, in particular, have a job to do in their party, just as #NeverTrump Republicans had a job to do in theirs. For the danger to American Jewish voters is now manifesting itself in both parties—and Jewish Democrats need to face up to that fact right now, or else there won't be a party in this country that refuses a prominent place to bigots. If Jewish Democrats think their party will be a welcoming place for them, (never mind electable at the national level), with a former associate of the Nation of Islam as its chairman, they're meshuggah. That Keith Ellison is even a serious candidate for the top DNC post is part of a broader trend of hostility to the Jewish State and Jewish concerns initiated by the outgoing administration. The White House's decision last month to abstain on a United Nations Security Council resolution denying any Jewish connection to the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, followed by John Kerry's endless speech blaming Israel for his own failures while throwing around words like “apartheid,” were not accidents. The resolution was approved and shepherded by the White House. The occupant of the White House is Barack Obama, who will continue to live in Washington and retain a great deal of influence over Democrats. After their surprise loss, the Clintons are gone for good. They're kaput. Those are facts.
A war is already brewing for the soul of the Democratic Party. On one side are many of its Jewish voters and donors. On the other side are hard-left activists and agitators who make a very public point of wanting those people purged. Some of these agitators, like Bernie Sanders, are not even Democrats yet strangely expect, and are offered, deference from the very party leaders and influencers whom Sanders and his acolytes want to expel in their “revolution.” I would encourage Democrats concerned about the future of their party to read a recent New Yorker article about a podcast produced by a group of anti-capitalist Brooklyn Twitter personalities that has become quite popular among young, politically conscious millennials. Christening themselves the “Dirtbag Left,” the hosts of Chapo Trap House epitomize last year's “Bernie Bro” phenomenon in that they are aggressively masculine-to-the-point-of-misogynistic leftists whose politics mix the nihilistic gonzo sensibility of Hunter S. Thompson with the narcissistic machismo of Andreas Baader. Good luck with that.
It is an article of faith among this crew that Sanders would have handily defeated Trump had Democrats abjured the counsel of their perfidious “neoliberal” donor overlords and nominated a 74-year-old socialist for the presidency. This bit of retrospective insanity is driving the push for Ellison's chairmanship of the party, and it betrays the penchant for half-baked fantasizing so common on the regressive left. If there's one thing it ought to have learned from this most recent presidential election, it's that a country that just elected a xenophobic demagogue over Hillary Clinton would not have preferred a radical leftist. For in the battle of left-wing versus right-wing populism, (which is what a Trump-Sanders election would have essentially boiled down to), the latter will always win. When, in history, has it not?
The emotions upon which right-wing populism draws—national identity, peoplehood, culture, tradition—are more visceral than the class-based interest aroused by the left-wing variant. All the more so in a white-majority country rapidly becoming minority-majority.
Beholden as they are to the Marxist conviction of inevitable class struggle, however, progressives persist in their claim that the reason why working class whites no longer vote for left-wing parties in the numbers they used to is because of false consciousness. What's the Matter with Kansas is that Kansans don't vote the way What's the Matter With Kansas? author Thomas Frank and denizens of the Chapo Trap House think they should. Frank has returned with yet another hectoring screed against “neoliberalism,” Listen Liberal, which once more faults Clintonian Third Way politics and calls upon Democrats to embrace their inner McGovernites. The solution to working-class people voting against their economic interests, Frank believes, is to pull the Democratic Party even further to the left.
It never seems to cross the mind of progressive commentators that white working-class people consciously vote against the party promising greater social spending and higher taxes on the rich because other issues—immigration, abortion, Making America Great Again—matter more to them than their marginal tax rates or public services. But if there's anyone who should understand the validity of voting against one's own economic interests, it should be cosmopolitan, upper-middle-class liberal elites, the usual purveyors of these myopic screeds about the self-harming ignorance of those toiling below. After all, they regularly vote against their narrow economic interests by choosing to support a party and policies that will raise their taxes. Is what's good for the white, upper-middle-class, leftist goose not good for the white, lower-middle-class, culturally-conservative gander?
There is no objective evidence to suggest that moving the Democratic Party further to the left will help its electoral fortunes. A recent paper published by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government examining voting patterns for populist parties and candidates across the Western world over the past several decades shows that economic class has become a less important factor in determining party preference while cultural issues have risen in influence. A 2012 book by Harvard's Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, based on interviews with hundreds of Tea Party activists, argues that the driving force behind the movement was cultural resentment, not economics—a conclusion that is ever more convincing in light of Trump's victory as a big-government race-baiter.
Responding to this phenomenon doesn't mean that liberals need to start adopting the positions of right-wing populists. But it also doesn't mean aping Trump's demagoguery with a left-wing sheen, as dirtbag leftists would have it. The danger for Democrats is that they'll go the way of Britain's Labour Party, whose example should be a sobering one for Jewish Democrats, no matter which one of those identifiers they value most. The seizure of that once-great vehicle for working-class aspirations by Islamist-sympathizing, IRA-supporting, America-hating Trotskyists was partly procedural, in that rule changes instituted prior to the party's 2015 leadership contest allowing anyone who paid £3 to participate opened the door to a throng of hard-left activists. They, in turn, catapulted radical backbencher Jeremy Corbyn to the top. Yet that singular focus on Labour's internal bureaucracy obscures the failure of its leaders and members to confront a deeper, more systemic problem: the creeping advance within the party of Third-Worldist fellow travelers for militant Islam and all other sorts of illiberal anti-Western movements, a danger Nick Cohen presciently warned about a decade ago in his book What's Left?
If you want to understand how quickly such a radical shift in a party's ideological composition can occur, consider that, in 2009, 57 percent of Republicans expressed positive views about free trade. Today, after a year of Trump's incessant anti-trade demagoguery, 68 percent believe it's a bad thing. In the 2012 presidential election, the Republican nominee correctly labeled Russia our “No. 1 geopolitical foe.” Today's incoming Republican president wants to make Moscow our close ally, and the vast majority of Republicans appear willing to go along with this dishonorable blunder and strategic disaster.
The moral of the story is that putting their heads in the sand didn't work for moderate members of the Labour Party or anti-authoritarian Republicans, and it won't work for Democrats. Obama was a historic president, a witty man, and a good writer. But anyone who looks at his legacy abroad must acknowledge that it has been an unmitigated disaster. Obama's main foreign policy—partnering with Iran's repressive and vile theocracy—has led to the deaths of 500,000 people in Syria and a migrant crisis threatening to destroy one of America's greatest post-World War II achievements—the modern European project. It also, incidentally, has been terrible for Israel. None of that was defensible. It was a catastrophe, and the endless denial of that reality by the White House and its echo chambers, and by well-meaning team players, played a part in electing Donald Trump.
The latest round of White House-led grandstanding on Israel has a concrete purpose, which has nothing to do with the future of the Middle East that Obama has torched. It's about mainstreaming the campus haters who have turned BDS into a way of boycotting Jewish students and professors on their own campuses. There may be biological Jews like George Soros and Max Blumenthal who will feel comfortable in the Democratic Party that some of its present-day leaders are attempting to engineer. But the majority of American Jews won't. Nor, of course, will they feel comfortable in Steve Bannon's volkisch GOP. So fight for your homes while you still have them. Stop pretending that everything will be OK. Take it from me, a homeless former Jewish Republican voter: It won't be OK.

Did you know that City Hall in London sports a superb new imagery graphic of London's boroughs on its atrium floor? Open to the public, and home to the Greater London Authority (GLA) and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the atrium floor is covered in our OS MasterMap Imagery Layer.
Displaying the latest Olympic Park imagery, flown in June this year, the graphic was put together by our Pre- and Post-Sales Support and Remote Sensing teams. They colour-balanced our imagery and created a huge seamless mosaic of vertical imagery in the GLA boundary.
We delivered the imagery to the GLA in mid-June, ready to be laid on the City Hall floor ahead of the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games. City Hall played a key role in hosting activities during the Games and was renamed London House for the duration. Our flooring was of great interest during the activities as people spotted famous landmarks and locations under their feet.
In October a number of our staff involved in the project accompanied our Director General, Vanessa Lawrence CB to City Hall to meet the Mayor Of London, Boris Johnson, and showcase our work.

Longzhu Gaming will continue to field Kim "PraY" Jong-in, Kang "GorillA" Beon-hyeon and Kim "Khan" Dong-ha through the 2018 season, the organization announced on Facebook Tuesday.
Longzhu still has Kwak "BDD" Bo-sung, Moon "Cuzz" Woo-chan and substitute Kim "Rascal" Kwang-hee under contract, meaning they could field their 2017 starting roster in 2018.
Longzhu Gaming were considered one of the strongest Korean LoL teams this season. The team won the 2017 LCK Summer Split, and while they were considered favorites to win the World Championship, they failed to make it past the quarterfinals after taking a 3-0 loss to eventual champions Samsung Galaxy.
Longzhu signed both PraY and Gorilla in 2016, after the bot lane duo left the ROX Tigers. Khan joined Longzhu in May, after leaving the Qiao Gu Reapers in China.
According to the Facebook post, Longzhu has also terminated their contracts with their coach, Jung-su Kim, mid lane substitute Yoon "Justice" Seok-joon, substitute AD carry Lee "Lucy" Woo-jin and substitute support Jang "Zzus" Jun-su.

It is arguably the greatest goal ever scored in women's club football in the US and it was an Australian boot that struck it into the back of the net.
On a Saturday evening in June at Yurack Field in New Jersey, Perth-born Lisa De Vanna helped start Sky Blue FC's attacking move through the Boston Breakers' defence as she combined with Katy Freels before finishing it with an exquisite bicycle kick.
"It happened so quick," says Boston midfielder and fellow Australian Kyah Simon of her compatriot's stunning overhead strike.
"I was watching from the halfway line. As [Freels] scooped it up I thought the last time I saw someone scoop the ball was when I played indoor soccer ten years ago. So I had no idea what was going on at that point.
"And then Lisa just came out of nowhere with a bicycle kick and I had never seen her do one before in training or games. Caitlin [Foord, another Australian, who plays for De Vanna's Sky Blue team] and I just turned to ourselves and were like, 'Did she really just do that?'"
That flash of inspiration was the most captivating moment amongst a string of standout performances this season from the five Australians in the new professional National Women's Soccer League - Emily van Egmond at Seattle Reign and Samantha Kerr at Western New York Flash, along with De Vanna, Foord and Simon.
More importantly, their American experience could help write the history of this generation of Matildas, who are looking to take the next step on the international scene.
While the days of players paying their own way to training camps and international tournaments may be long gone, the problem for the Australian women's football team since its establishment in the 1970s has always been playing time.
After the 2011 Olympic women's football qualifying tournament it was over nine months before the Matildas gathered again for an international match. When the team gathered in Canberra for a double-header against New Zealand in June of this year it had been almost as long between games.
The brief 12-week W-League season, the domestic women's competition, doesn't yet offer a solution to this problem.
So with the chance to defend their Asian Cup title in 2014 fast approaching, the hopes of the Matildas have received an unexpected boost from North America.
Last year out of the ashes of the self-imploded Women's Professional Soccer league in the US came the NWSL. It is an initiative set up with funding from the American, Canadian and Mexican football federations to give their players the same crucial competitive playing time Matildas coach Hesterine De Reus wants for her charges.
The league's first regular season finished last weekend and the consensus is that the five Matildas thrived in a league where, as Foord puts it, they "run and run and run".
"The Aussies have definitely put a stamp on the league and I'm hoping more and more girls flock over here to the US and soak up the experience," says Simon.
"The main aspect is probably the physical aspect of the game. It definitely contributes with my fitness and my sharpness as well. I come from more of a European style football back in Australia. So when you compliment that with a higher fitness level and a higher agility it falls hand in hand.
"If we instilled that a little bit into our game as we are building through this transition phase we can really take some positives from experiencing the US league."
While De Vanna is a storied international with two World Cups under her belt, the average age of the other four Aussies in the NWSL is under 20 years old.
The even distribution of US internationals across the league means each of them are now playing alongside some of their generation's most successful athletes such as Hope Solo, Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone.
When Foord's season ended due to a strained ankle with her side on the verge of entering the play-offs, it was the advice of the 38-year-old veteran Rampone that helped the Wollongong native find some perspective.
"You're young, you're going to heal so quick," Rampone told her. "You're going to have so many more opportunities."
That advice coming from a mother of two who's experienced the lows of major injuries through to the highs of World Cup glory struck a chord with the 18-year-old Foord.
"For Christie, for the age she's at and after having two kids, she's an amazing person," she explained. "How she's still playing so well and so fit, just learning from her, she's told our team a few things about how you get an injury and you just keep going. From doing that look at what she's achieved."
With two of the four teams in the NWSL play-offs featuring some of the Australians – Western New York and Sky Blue – attention for these five Matildas will soon turn back to international football.
"When I first came into the national team we came off that really good performance at the 2007 World Cup," says Simon.
"I think that was the time when women's football kind of got evaluated and it was like we actually are world contenders, we can compete. We're no longer going into games and trying not to lose and trying not to get goals scored against us. We're going into games knowing we have the ability."
Ability that will now be backed by a touch of American steel.
Chrome has a hidden 'flags' page, located at chrome://flags, where you can toggle various features and settings on and off. The page was redesigned not too long ago, but there's another helpful change now available in Chrome Beta, Dev, and Canary - the flags you manually enable or disable are now pushed to the top of the page.
This obviously makes it much easier to see which settings you have messed with. In the above screenshot, you can see I have switched two flags to 'Enabled,' which moves them to the top of the page.
Most end users don't visit the flags page at all, but for the few of us that like to tinker with Chrome's settings, this will be a welcome feature. It should arrive in Chrome stable with the release of v65 next month.
With Matt Lauer's recent firing, the #MeToo movement has hit an all-time high. I have seen it first hand on social media, and am truly amazed by the unity that has been brought on by these courageous women (and men) with their stories of sexual harassment and assault.
It has been sickening to hear these acts of violence, and my heart goes out to anyone who has been a victim.
What we need to look at is a real TRUE standard that needs to be set. But here's a question. How do we pick and choose whom to hold accountable? Why aren't we looking at all of the sexual harassment? Why are some things “just a joke” for some, and serious offenses for others? The solution is to come together and treat sexual harassment the same, no matter what side of the aisle you may be on.
Here is the definition of sexual harassment: harassment (typically of a woman) in a workplace, or other professional or social situation, involving the making of unwanted sexual advances or obscene remarks. And, in the interest of full disclosure, I'd like to add my family's name to the #MeToo list of those who have been harassed.
Are you ready to hold these people accountable? Here is a small example of what our family has gone though:
Chris Wallace
When Chris Wallace was asked if my Mom would be sitting in his lap for an interview, he responded, “One can only hope.
Did Wallace receive any consequences for this kind of sexual harassment?
None. No one at Fox radio batted an eye with his violent misogynist rant – in fact he's still celebrated.
Want to know the craziest thing about this? He still has a job at Fox News, and my mom doesn't.
Watch his remarks below:
David Letterman
Then, there was this. David Letterman “joked” about my 14 year old sister getting knocked up by Alex Rodriguez at a Yankees game in 2009 – also saying the biggest problem my parents would have in New York would be keeping Elliot Spitzer away from my sister – Elliot Spitzer, if you don't recall, was New York's governor in 2008, a man who had to resign in the midst of a scandal concerning his solicitation of prostitutes.
I'm glad that suddenly Hollywood is taking rape more seriously. Good for them. But
what consequence did Letterman receive for joking about the rape of an underage girl?
Did he get reprimanded by CBS for this? No, no one batted an eye at it. Even worse, watch this clip to see the other joke and the very humorous apology he gave about it.
Isn't it time that he paid a price for this, feminists? Or is it acceptable because he wasn't talking about Sasha Obama?
Watch his “joke” below:
Azeala Banks
Then, there's Azeala Banks. This rapper's Twitter account remained OPEN after these tweets about my mom just in 2016:
“Sarah Palin needs to have her hair shaved off to a buzz cut, get headfucked by a big veiny, ashy, black dick then be locked in a cupboard.”
Then, she tweeted this as well:
“Honestly… Let's find the burliest blackest niggas and let them run a train on her. Film it and put it on worldstar.”
What were Azeala's consequences? Nothing… TWITTER EVEN KEPT HER ACCOUNT OPEN!
Do you think they would condone this type of content if “Sarah Palin” was switched with “Hillary Clinton” instead? Or even “Elizabeth Warren?”
Hmm, doubtful.
Hat Tip: Daily Mail
Mike Tyson
The ex-boxer/sports commentator Mike Tyson so crudely said on radio: “You want (Sarah Palin) to be with somebody like [Dennis] Rodman getting up … in there. Pushing her guts up in the back of her head… You want someone like Rodman — yeah baby! Let's get that donkey in here now. [laughter] Just imagine Palin with a big old black stallion ripping. Yeehaw!”
Tyson was asked if he'd vote for my mom for allegedly being “open to having sex with black men.” He can't vote, of course, being a felon, but he said my mom “could always get boned out by a black person, a vote to bang her. Other than a vote to run office, the only thing she can do … she's not a bad person because she likes black people at least in her.”
Listen below:
Fox & Friends Alisyn Camerota
My mom went on Fox and Friends to talk about the BP oil spill and female political successes, but Alisyn Camerota (now with CNN) strayed to ask Mom about her breast size!
She handled Camerota's irrelevant subject of breast enhancements well, but still it put Mom in a humiliating position live on camera having to address questions about boob jobs!
Harassing lines of questioning like that is to sexualize the female guest, thus discrediting the important issues she's there to discuss.
Gee, I wonder why voters have a hard time taking female politicians seriously when a news organization is more interested in the size of their bra than their brain?
No man has to put up with that…
Let's take advantage of this important moment and do the right thing.
This isn't a “Poor Palin Pity Party,” I'm trying to point out a very real issue – as a society, we cannot have double standards on sexual issues. We won't fix it until victims of all political stripes are treated with respect and dignity!
We do need to stand together and hold the same amount of accountability for every predator. Whether it's R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein – if we want real change we need to stop the bullshit double standard.
Sexual harassment will never change when we have the double standards that we do today. This isn't about me or my family. Though the comments that have been made about us are horrible, this movement is way bigger than that.
Look at the left's beloved Hillary Clinton on one of her early trials – she defended a 42 year old man who raped a 12 year old girl… and laughed about him passing the polygraph. Watch this:
And also remember her terrible treatment of Bill's accusers Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones?
Even lesser-known Democrats like Lena Dunham (who WANTS to be the face of feminism but doesn't even know what real feminism is) picks and chooses what women's story to take legitimately.
For true equality, sexual harassment in the workplace MUST stop. If we're serious about real change, we need to apply the same standard to all, regardless of politics or demographics or anything else that's been used in the past to judge victims and perpetrators. To be taken seriously, women leading the feminist movement can't be defending predators just because they're friends (or husbands in some cases). Real leaders in this movement will be brave and honest women who have stood up for themselves and created unity though this cultural awakening.

Dianne McGrath was born the day before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and perhaps the universe was saying something in making that odd alignment. As McGrath's mother held her little daughter in her arms and watched the ghostly images of mankind's great leap on the black and white TV, she wasn't aware that her baby would eventually hope to go one better.
McGrath is on the shortlist to become one of the first people to land on Mars - 10 years from now. Whereas Armstrong returned to Earth - only to become increasingly grumpy - McGrath won't be coming back.

"It's a one-way ticket. We don't have the technology for a return flight. I'll eventually die up there," she says, with the same kind of cheer she brings to recalling her childhood dreams of going on Luke Skywalker-style adventures.
McGrath was one of more than 200,000 people worldwide to apply for a place in the Netherlands-based Mars One program, an independent not-for-profit project that aims to create a permanent settlement on the red planet. The idea is to raise $6 billion via crowdfunding and the sale of commercial rights for what could be the most catastrophic reality TV show ever. (Although this season of The Bachelor may take some beating.)
Whatever the new administration does, we're in for months, perhaps even a year, of economic hell. After that, things should get better, as President Obama's stimulus plan -- O.K., I'm told that the politically correct term is now "economic recovery plan" -- begins to gain traction. Late next year the economy should begin to stabilize, and I'm fairly optimistic about 2010.
But what comes after that? Right now everyone is talking about, say, two years of economic stimulus -- which makes sense as a planning horizon. Too much of the economic commentary I've been reading seems to assume, however, that that's really all we'll need -- that once a burst of deficit spending turns the economy around we can quickly go back to business as usual.
In fact, however, things can't just go back to the way they were before the current crisis. And I hope the Obama people understand that.
The prosperity of a few years ago, such as it was -- profits were terrific, wages not so much -- depended on a huge bubble in housing, which replaced an earlier huge bubble in stocks. And since the housing bubble isn't coming back, the spending that sustained the economy in the pre-crisis years isn't coming back either.
...
[O[nce the economy has perked up a bit, there will be a lot of pressure on the new administration to pull back, to throw away the economy's crutches. And if the administration gives in to that pressure too soon, the result could be a repeat of the mistake F.D.R. made in 1937 -- the year he slashed spending, raised taxes and helped plunge the United States into a serious recession.
Unai Emery: Not heading to Upton Park, it now appears
Unai Emery is to remain as coach of Seville after agreeing a new deal with the Spanish club until 2017.
West Ham had hoped that Emery, who flew to London earlier this week, would agree to replace former boss Sam Allardyce whose contract at the Boleyn Ground was not renewed at the end of last season.
It was also reported that Emery turned down the chance to coach Napoli after their manager Rafa Benitez moved to Real Madrid earlier this week.
Emery has now decided to stay with the Spaniards who have enjoyed back-to-back triumphs in the Europa League, and will be playing in the Champions League next season.
A statement published on Sevilla's official website on Friday read: "Unai Emery has extended his contract with Sevilla for another season, thus prolonging his link with the Nervion club until 2017.
"The coach has committed his future to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, where he has achieved his greatest successes, winning the Europa League in both 2014 and 2015."
Sky sources understand Emery held talks with West Ham on Wednesday. West Ham, who are moving to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, are expected to now turn their attention to Croat Slaven Bilic - a former stalwart of the club - and Marseille's Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa.
The theory of sexual misadventure has been bolstered by evidence that Mr. Williams, a bachelor with no known romantic involvements, went to transvestite performances and visited sites on the Internet dedicated to bondage and “claustrophilia,” a condition that involves getting sexual thrills from being shut in enclosed spaces.
Investigators also discovered that he had more than $30,000 worth of women's high-fashion clothing, including Christian Louboutin shoes and Christian Dior dresses, in carefully packed bags in his apartment. Much of the clothing was brand new, but some of the 26 pairs of shoes had been worn, and a bright orange woman's wig was found over the back of a chair, along with a pair of newly pressed men's underpants, in Mr. Williams's otherwise sparsely decorated but conspicuously tidy bedroom.
At the inquest on Friday, a video was played showing two men hired by the police — one a yoga expert and the other a former military man trained in escape techniques, and both of roughly the same size and height as the muscular, athletic, 5-foot-7-inch Mr. Williams — trying to replicate what he would have had to do to get himself into the bag alone and lock it from inside. Using the same kind of red, extra-large North Face duffel bag, and the tub in the Pimlico flat, the two men were shown contorting themselves — more than 100 times in the case of one man, and 300 times in the case of the other — without managing the feat.
Investigators concluded that someone else had to have helped in closing the bag and locking it. The police have said further that they cannot rule out that Mr. Williams was dead before being placed in the bag, or that the bag with his body in it was lifted into the bathtub from somewhere else. There were no fingerprints or other traces that would have been expected if Mr. Williams had supported himself on the bathtub's rim while lowering himself into the bag.
Concerns about national security have contributed to the 20-month delay in the inquest.
Mr. Williams, a Cambridge-educated mathematical genius from the mountains of North Wales, was working on what his superiors have described as the practical use of new technologies in the field of electronic surveillance. Police testimony has described him as a picture of tranquillity in death, lying faceup, looking “very calm,” with no injuries to his nails or fingers and no “signs of stress or fear” on his body or on the bag's interior netting. But the men who tried to lock themselves in the bag, and pathologists, have said at the inquest that he would have suffocated within 30 minutes from a rapid 20-degree rise in heat and a buildup of carbon dioxide.

Family members, including Mr. Williams's parents and a sister, appealed unsuccessfully to the coroner not to allow the video of the re-enactment to be shown to the court, but it was quickly posted on the Internet after the court session ended. Inquest sessions have been suspended when relatives have broken into sobbing and hyperventilating, on one occasion when a senior MI6 officer testified anonymously from behind a screen that their son's MI6 supervisor had not been disciplined for failing to report him missing, even though the normally punctilious Mr. Williams had not been at work for more than a week.

MI6 and the other spy agencies in Britain, including Government Communications Headquarters, the powerful, partly American-financed electronic surveillance center, which had transferred Mr. Williams to MI6, are no strangers to scandals that have involved the sex lives of some of their greatest talents.
Alan M. Turing, the mathematician whom many regard as the father of modern computer science, known for leading the team that cracked Nazi Germany's military ciphers in World War II, committed suicide in 1954 by eating a cyanide-laced apple after being convicted of homosexuality, then a criminal offense. The so-called Cambridge spies of the 1950s, several of whom fled to the Soviet Union, had homosexual liaisons as young men.

But MI6 has used the mystery of Mr. Williams's death to signal that efforts have been made to neutralize the potential for blackmail in the private lives of British agents. One of the two MI6 officials who have testified at the inquest said the agency knew of Mr. Williams's sexual predilections, including his visits to bondage Web sites, his interest in transvestite performances and his collection of women's clothing, and deemed that they posed no problem in his professional life, where he had performed “world-class work.” Other MI6 officials have said some of his work involved close contact with American spy agencies, and visits to the United States.
The MI6 official, identified in court as SIS F — for the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6's formal name, and “female” — said agents' sex lives were now their own private concern. “There is no set template for what their lifestyle should be,” she said. “Individuals have lifestyle and sexual choices and sexual preferences which are perfectly legitimate.” But she also said Mr. Williams had used his MI6 computer to make “a small number” of illicit searches on the MI6 database, which she did not detail, that could have made him vulnerable to blackmail by foreign agents. While the agency believed there was no connection between his spy work and his death, she said, that could not be ruled out.
Another clue to Mr. Williams's mind-set at his death came from a clipping from the newspaper The Observer that was found in his flat. Dated on the day before his last Web search, the article focused on research into what people on their deathbeds most regretted. These included not having the “courage to live true to myself” and wishing they had “stayed in touch with friends” and had “let myself be happier.”
Allegations abound that President Donald Trump has sought to obstruct justice. The U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating and may conclude that greater crimes can be prosecuted — crimes explicitly related to the abuse of power.

If Mr. Mueller builds this case, then it will be for the U.S. Congress to launch impeachment proceedings. Congressional committees are pursuing their own investigations now.
With ruthless determination President Trump is systematically undermining the U.S. law enforcement authorities that could check the abuse of power for personal gain by him and his associates in the White House.
Clearing house
Public prosecutors have been fired and not replaced. Increasing numbers of vacancies in offices of U.S. Inspectors-Generals are not being filled and budgets for these offices are being cut.
Top U.S. Justice Department officials have been dismissed. The White House has hired former lobbyists, given them waivers exempting conflict-of-interest rules and fought the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) about revealing the waivers.
The President has publicly derided judges who do not share his views. Taken together these are actions seen only in authoritarian regimes.
Advertisement:
One important facet of President Trump's approach is that he is demanding that top law enforcement officers explicitly demonstrate their allegiance to him. If they respond that on assuming their positions they swore to uphold the U.S. Constitution, then that is not good enough for Trump.
Former FBI Director James Comey says that Trump asked him to both confirm that the President was not under investigation, and that he state his full loyalty to the President. Comey refused, and was fired.
Prosecutors
Acting Attorney-General Sally Yates at the Justice Department was fired directly after challenging the legality of President Trump's executive order barring immigrants from eight Muslim countries.
President Trump invited U.S. Public Prosecutor Preet Bharara in New York just for a chat at Trump Tower in December and thereafter telephoned him several times just for a general conversation.

Bharara was increasingly uncomfortable about what he felt was an effort to undermine his independence. Before returning yet another call from the president, Bharara informed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he felt it inappropriate to return the call from the President. Bharara was fired the next day.
A considerable number of vacancies in offices of public prosecutors were waiting to be filled by the Trump Administration earlier this year. Then, in early March, the Attorney General fired 46 more public prosecutors, all of whom had been appointed in the course of the eight years that President Obama held office.
A few weeks ago, the White House sent the names of 12 lawyers to the U.S. Senate for confirmation as public prosecutors, noting: “These candidates share the president's vision for ‘Making America Safe Again.”

Watchdogs
The New York Times recently reported that: “Today nearly one-quarter of inspector general offices have either an acting director or no director at all, including the offices at the C.I.A., the National Security Agency, the Department of Defense and the Social Security Administration.
Acting directors can be reluctant to make extensive changes or take bold action, particularly if they hope to be nominated for a permanent appointment.”

Every U.S. Federal government department has an inspector general authorized to investigate waste, abuse, corruption and other illegality.
These officers play invaluable watchdog roles. Within each government department these are the people who serve as the single most powerful check on abuse of office by all government employees, including those in top positions appointed by the president.
Waivers for lobbyists
Meanwhile, the President who campaigned to “clean the swamp” of lobbyists and special interest lawyers and consultants in government, has been waging a battle with the OGE.
Advertisement:
To guard against conflicts of interest, presidents should not appoint former paid consultants to public offices where they may deal with issues that relate to those private interests that previously hired them to lobby on their behalf.
Exceptions can be made when the President grants a special waiver, which ever since the aftermath of the Watergate scandal 39 years ago have been reported to the OGE.
Over many weeks the OGE and the White House exchanged letters about this issue as the President was granting increasing numbers of waivers.
At one point, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Trump Administration's Office of Management and Budget, questioned OGE's legal authority and requested that it suspend its collection of waiver information.
Advertisement:
Finally, at the end of May the White House grandly stated it was making a concession and making waiver information public. It said it had granted ethics waivers to 17 appointees who work for President Trump and Vice President Pence.
The Obama Administration issued exactly the same number of similar waivers over its entire eight-year term of office.
Family conflicts of interest
It is far from clear that those official White House appointees, Trump daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, are in full compliance with conflict-of-interest ethics rules as both of them continue to have significant financial interests in their former businesses.
Kushner's financial dealings are part of the investigation now being pursued by Special Counsel Mueller.
Advertisement:
And so, totally in line with the overall effort to undermine law enforcement, friends of President Trump have recently taken to television shows to denigrate Mueller, question his own possible conflicts of interest and float the possibility that he too might be fired by Trump.
In fact, Mueller could only be fired by Deputy Justice Department Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who was appointed to office by Trump only a couple of months ago, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from anything to do with Mueller's investigation as he may be one of its targets.
And so, true to character, Trump issued a Tweet recently suggesting that Rosenstein may have to go.
Trump's denigration of law enforcement, as well as U.S. intelligence services, is also moving into a higher rhetorical gear as the President has hired several prominent private lawyers as his personal advocates. They are stoking the fires that the President is the victim of a “witch hunt.”

All the actions noted above are not isolated and spontaneous – they are part of a Trump strategy to bend the law to serve his own purposes. Keep watching as the strategy continues to unfold.
'The only duty of MPAs is to make laws and overse­e their implem­entati­on' says Imran Khan
ISLAMABAD / ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan has spelled out a 13-point ‘agenda of change and development' for Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), the province where his party is in power, while announcing that K-P would take the lead in abolishing discretionary funds for provincial legislators.
“The only duty of MPAs is to make laws and oversee their implementation. The bad tradition of doling out development funds to MPAs was introduced by the then military ruler, General Ziaul Haq,” Imran told a news conference on Monday.
As more abandon PTI, change slips through Imran's grasp
He said his party has decided to devolve financial powers to local governments. “A provincial financial commission is being set up that will release funds to the local governments and districts without political interference,” he added.
‘The agenda of change and development' also includes allocation of Rs33 billion [or 30% of K-P's budget] to the local governments, distribution of funds irrespective of party affiliation, making the Chief Minister House available to top taxpayers and opening of the CM/speaker's rest houses in Nathiagali for general public.
“It also includes introduction of conflict of interest law, police reforms, induction of 40,000 new teachers, all new appointments through NTS [National Testing Service], lower judiciary reforms and Peshawar Mass Transit,” he added.
The PTI chairman said these reforms were part of his party's manifesto but could not be implemented earlier. He termed the new agenda a landmark in the country's history and said his party was entering a new phase in K-P.
Imran also mentioned a number of new laws the K-P government was going to pass. “This reforms agenda includes Police Act 2016 aimed at de-politicising the police, and Public Safety Commission will oversee this act,” he added.
He said his party is going to make the health sector and the hospitals of the province exemplary. A new accountability law is being introduced that will be more powerful than the previous one besides the introduction of whistle-blower act in which whistle-blowers highlighting graft will get 25 per cent of the recovery.
Imran slams Sindh leadership for ‘looting development funds'
“Corruption in K-P is at the lowest level compared to other provinces, according to the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) survey,” he added.
Responding to a question about release of funds to Madrassa Haqqania in Akora Khattak, he said the K-P government was going to sign an MoU with all seminaries in the province as it wanted to bring their students into the mainstream. “We want to integrate three different syllabuses in the country and to provide 2.2 million madrasa students the opportunity to learn modern-day subjects,” he said.

Kim Reynolds, smiles as children from a choir proceed to their seats after performing during the Service of Dedication during January 2015 inauguration activities at Christ the King Catholic Church in Des Moines.

Gov. Terry Branstad's proclamation that encourages Iowans to take part in a statewide county courthouse Bible-reading marathon violates the U.S. Constitution by promoting Christianity, three groups allege.
Two of those groups — the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and the Freedom From Religion Foundation — said they were reviewing the matter with an eye toward litigation against the state.
“The government is supposed to be neutral toward religion,” said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of Freedom From Religion Foundation, a Wisconsin-based group.
She continued: “Can you imagine the uproar if the governor used state resources to encourage people to go to a ‘God is Dead' rally or a vigil to review how divisive religion is? Everyone can see how inappropriate that would be. This is exactly the same type of violation.”
The prayer events are being organized by several Christian-based groups: the Iowa Prayer Caucus, the National Governor's Prayer Team and the United States Prayer Council. The Iowa events are planned at the courthouses of all 99 counties, some with prayers every 15 minutes from June 30 through July 3.
Branstad in April signed a proclamation "in the name and by the authority of the state of Iowa," calling the event historic. The proclamation encourages Iowans to participate in the events and “to read through the Bible on a daily basis each year until the Lord comes.”
Gaylor, Rita Bettis from the ACLU of Iowa, as well as Jason Benell of the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers, contend the governor's action violates what is known as the “Lemon Test.” That's a reference to a 1971 U.S. Supreme Court cases named after Alton Lemon, the plaintiff in a case that determined it unconstitutional for Pennsylvania to reimburse private schools for salaries and textbooks.
Imgur
The Lemon Test developed three key questions in review of a clause in the First Amendment that prohibits government from promoting one religion over another:
Does the government action have a secular purpose? Does the government action have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion? Does the government action foster an excessive entanglement between government and religion?
A violation can result if the answer to any of the three questions is determined illegal. The Lemon Test has been cited in multiple cases involving such things as Christmas decorations on government property and issued around student-led prayer.
Similar types of activities encouraged by government have taken place for decades, including proclamations signed by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.
Ben Hammes, a spokesman for Branstad, noted that a challenge to a Colorado prayer proclamation was rejected in 2014 by that state's supreme court, which concluded that people who objected didn't suffer harm and had no grounds to sue.
Branstad has previously signed proclamations for Muslim Recognition Days and has faced criticism for signing other prayer day proclamations.

“The governor issues many proclamations that recognize events, activities and different organizations' causes,” Hammes said. “Requests come from a broad spectrum of Iowans that reflect the broad diversity of Iowa.”
Ginny Caligiuri, an organizer of the Iowa event and a board member and a state director of the Iowa Prayer Caucus, called the concept of separation of church and state “a fallacy.” The roots of that doctrine were to protect religions, not government, she said.
But Bettis, the state ACLU's legal director, says the issue is about endorsing a particular religion.
“The governor's proclamation is frankly outrageous and embarrassing, and inconsistent with our core American and Iowan principles of inclusion and respect of all its people of all faiths, as well as those who are not religious,” Bettis said Tuesday. “Our U.S. and Iowa state constitutions protect from precisely this sort of government overreaching and endorsement of a particular faith.”

It may be loved by children - but this sweet treat looks suspiciously like a condom.
Known as 'Bubble Cream', the dessert is wrapped in a rubber sheath requiring the eater to bite through the tip.
The weirdly-packaged treat is growing in popularity in China, but has attracted criticism from parents who say they are too embarrassed to explain to their child why they shouldn't be eating it.
Parents criticised the product after photos showing children buying the ice cream in Shenyang were posted on a microblogging site by a user with the surname Jiang.

The Global Times reported him as saying: "I was stunned that it looked just like a condom.
"I would feel embarrassed to eat it as an adult, let alone giving it to a child. How can they sell products like that to children?"
Father of a primary school child, Mr Wang, said: "I don't know how to explain to my kid why he shouldn't eat it. He's so little. It's really embarrasssing."
A London lawyer recently slated Nestle for having an image which looked like a penis molded onto a Milkybar – the shape is supposed to be a horse's head.
The writings of Esther Earl, a teenage girl who died in 2010 after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer and to whom John Green's “The Fault in Our Stars” is dedicated, are being published.
A collection titled “This Star Won't Go Out: The Life and Words of Esther Grace Earl” will be released by Dutton on Jan. 28, 2014 and Green will write a foreword for the book.
“She would have loved to be an author,” Earl's mother, Lori Earl, told USA Today.
Earl's father, Wayne, said he was going to self-publish his daughter's material until Green saw it. The author gave the stories, letters, and other writings to his editor.
Earl, who died when she was 16, became well-known on the Internet for her YouTube videos. Green said that he tried to write a novel about young adults who were diagnosed with cancer before meeting Earl but that the work always came out too negatively. Getting to know Earl made him see that “kids with stage 4 cancer can be just as funny, and as normal and as afraid as any other kid,” the author told USA Today.

However, Green has made it clear that his protagonist, Hazel, is very different from Earl.
“I don't want people conflating Esther with Hazel (they're very different),” he wrote on his Tumblr page. “And it's extremely important to me that I not claim to be telling Esther's story.”

TORONTO -- The man heading up Ontario's effort to lure Amazon to the province said Thursday that while the province would consider sensible incentives, the bid will not offer billions in subsidies to the tech giant.
Providing large taxpayer subsidies to the firm wouldn't be fair to other companies that have set up shop in Ontario with little or no government assistance, said Ed Clark, who was appointed last week by Premier Kathleen Wynne to head up the Greater Toronto Region's bid to become the home of Amazon's new corporate headquarters.
The region's bid to Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will highlight other strengths such as the province's skilled workforce, Clark said, adding that the province would be willing to make other contributions like helping the company secure land.
"There are clearly places in the United States that will, I use the word, bribe, people to come," he said. "(They) say you just tell us what cheque you want us to write, we will write that cheque. We're not in that business."
If that's what Amazon is looking for, Ontario will not win, said Clark, who retired as an executive with TD Bank in 2014.
"But we have proven people are coming to Toronto right now, and to Ontario, because we've just got fantastic people."
The online retail giant announced earlier this month that it is hunting for a second North American office, saying it would spend $5 billion to build the new headquarters to house as many as 50,000 employees.
The company said it wants to be near a metropolitan area with more than a million people; be able to attract top technical talent; be within 45 minutes of an international airport; have direct access to mass transit; and be able to expand that headquarters to more than 740,000 square metres in the next decade.
Clark said the two biggest roadblocks a Toronto region bid will face are the pressure to spend large amounts on tax incentives and potential blowback to the firm created by U.S. President Donald Trump's push to keep American companies from moving operations to other countries.
"It will be seen as a major political statement if Amazon says the next 50,000 jobs we create are going to be in Canada," he said. "Whether they will stand that political heat, we don't know."
"(Bezos) may well be prepared to take that heat and there are companies that say the most important thing is that they get the people and a tax break here or there isn't going to sway it," Clark said.
Cities have until Oct. 19 to apply through a special website, and Amazon said it will make a final decision next year.
Amazon's current campus in Seattle takes up more than 750,000 square metres, has 33 buildings and 24 restaurants and is home to more than 40,000 employees. At the second headquarters, Amazon said it will hire up to 50,000 new full-time employees over the next 15 years who would have an average pay of more than US$100,000 a year.
Toronto Mayor John Tory downplayed concerns the city's rising housing costs and congestion issues might hurt the bid. If the region is successful, by the time the facility is built, the city and region will have increased its housing supply and transit capacity, he said.
"If you go down (Amazon's) list and tick the boxes, I would say that this region is as well prepared and represented to bid and to be very competitive as any other in the world. But it doesn't mean that it's not going to be a tough competition."
Like many things that will happen in 2016, actor Sean Penn's interview with Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was inevitably tinged by the U.S. presidential election.
In his story about the meeting - which apparently helped Mexican authorities recapture Guzman after he escaped from a maximum security prison in July - Penn wrote "I am reminded of press accounts alleging a hundred-million-dollar bounty the man across from me is said to have put on Donald Trump's life. I mention Trump. El Chapo smiles, ironically saying, 'Ah! Mi amigo!'"
An unverified Twitter account purporting to belong to El Chapo sent Trump a threatening and profanity-laced message in response to some of Trump's tweets about the drug lord. The message has since been taken down, but it prompted Trump to alert the FBI.
Trump talked about El Chapo to bolster his claim that Mexico sends drugs (along with criminals and rapists) into the U.S.
The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015
The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the U.S. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015
When will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, "Mexico is sending....", which turned out to be true? El Chapo — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015
That hasn't deterred Trump from talking about the drug lord's recapture at his rallies.
"Mexico is going to be the new China because what they're doing to us is unbelievable, although they did catch El Chapo. Good? Good? They did catch El Chapo, that's good. I mean I don't know, he better not escape a third time, you know? Those tunnels, bing, boom, right under the toilet, bing boom, right up. It's pretty amazing when you think about it, right? But anyway. I have an idea: Put him on the fourth floor this time, right? No more, no more first floors," Trump said Saturday in Clear Lake, Iowa. He was referring to Guzman's July escape through a 1-mile tunnel from a small opening in the shower area of his cell.
Former Railway Minister Bansal was re-nominated by from today brushing aside the "taint" argument as it released the second list of 71 candidates who include film star Nagma in Meerut and Youth chief Rajeevv Satav from Hingoli.
Bansal had to resign from the cabinet in the wake of the Rs ten crore cash-for-post bribery scam allegedly involving his nephew Vijay Singla and nine other people when the leader had held the portfolio.
The list includes renomination of several Union Ministers including M Veerappa Moily, Shashi Tharoor, V Narayanasamy, K C Venugopal, K V Thomas and Mullapally Ramchandran.
A surprise was the candidature of Satav, a close associate of Rahul Gandhi, as Hingoli seat in region of was in quota under the seat-sharing understanding. Apparently, some last-minute talks at the top level clinched the deal in favour of Satav.
Party spokesperson Raj Babbar, who had defeated UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav in a bye-election from Firozabad was shifted to Ghaziabad, a constituency currently represented by BJP chief Rajnath Singh.
The party has named Tarun Patel from Domariyaganj seat, which was represented by Jagdambika Pal who has left Congress.
The lone party MP from Jharkhand Subodhkant Sahay again got a nomination despite opposition from a section of the leadeship who doubted his winnability. There was speculation that Babbar, Nagma or cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin, the MP from Moradabad in UP, could be fielded from the Jharkhand capital.
Senior party leader Begum Noor Bano has been fielded from Moradabad, a Muslim-majority seat. In an earlier Lok Sabha, she had represented Rampur.
Party veteran from Karnataka Janardhana Pujari has been chosen for Dakshin Kannada seat while party spokesperson P C Chacko's constituency has been changed from Thrissur to Chalakudy. K P Dhannapalan contests from Thrissur.
With the second list, Congress has so far declared candidates for 261 seats and four of the 194 candidates declared in the first list have been changed.
A five-year-old child found a really big surprise inside a Kinder egg – a bag of the mind-melting stimulant crystal meth, which keeps users ‘wired' for days at a time.
Thankfully, the boy and his brother handed over the plastic shell to their Dad in the Drumachose area of Belfast, according to the Daily Star.
Limavady DUP councillor Alan Robinson said, ‘On Sunday night I was contacted by a gentleman whose nephew had found a Kinder egg hidden in a hedge in the Edenmore Road area of Limavady.
‘When the child opened the plastic section, hidden within was a small sealed plastic bag containing a white powder. Having passed the contents to the police the family have told me that they have informed them that it contained an illegal drug.

Sen. Coburn Offers To Put An Outdated Agency Out Of Its Misery With His 'Let Me Google That For You' Bill
from the microsoft-now-hastily-composing-angry-response-letters dept
No entity highlights the ridiculous amount of bureaucratic inefficiency and ineptitude of government agencies better than the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Its reports are loaded with the sort of damning evidence that would lead those unfamiliar with how government actually works to assume that heads will be rolling. In reality, the agencies investigated by the GAO soldier on from scathing report to scathing report with little to no sign of improvement.
Tom Coburn, a long-time combatant of government waste and fraud who publishes a yearly report exposing the worst of worst in terms of senseless government spending (the "Wastebook") is now using the GAO's own words to craft a bill targeting the money pit that is the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).
Here's the leadup:
(3) NTIS is tasked with collecting and distributing government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information and reports.
(4) GAO found that NTIS sold only 8 percent of the 2,500,000 reports in its collection between 1995 and 2000.
(5) A November 2012 GAO review of NTIS made the following conclusions:
(A) 'Of the reports added to NTIS's repository during fiscal years 1990 through 2011, GAO estimates that approximately 74 percent were readily available from other public sources.'
(B) 'These reports were often available either from the issuing organization's website, the Federal Internet portal (http://www.USA.gov) or from another source located through a web search.'
(C) 'The source that most often had the report [GAO] was searching for was another website located through http://www.Google.com.'
(D) '95 percent of the reports available from sources other than NTIS were available free of charge.'
(6) No Federal agency should use taxpayer dollars to purchase a report from the National Technical Information Service that is available through the Internet for free.
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the 'Let Me Google That For You Act.'
NTIS product expenditures exceeded revenues for 10 out of the past 11 fiscal years.
And here's the punchline:Someone had fun cranking out this "Short Title."As the bill points out, it was suggested by the Secretary of Commerce in 1999 that the NTIS would eventually outlive its usefulness. According to the GAO's 2012 findings, that sell-by date was reached more than a decade ago.The "Let Me Google That For You" Act calls for the repeal of the 1988 National Technical Information Act and the disbandment of the agency itself, with the redistribution of whichever of its duties are still deemed essential to the Commerce Department.It's not often you get the chance to watch an extraneous government agency be put down and even rarer still under a snarky, incisive, short title. This is for the best. As we've seen all too frequently, time marches on, swiftly distancing itself from the glacial pace of government innovation.

It may have a ton of history, but the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza has nearly 100 years of it without much in the way of significant upgrades.
Recently, Milan Mayor Beppe Sala talked to the media about the prospects of both FC Internazionale and AC Milan leaving the San Siro and striking out on their own somewhere else in the city.
Sala said there is a potential for a new stadium for both teams to continue to share.
“With Milan we started the phase of outlining the potential of other spaces to build a new stadium,” he said, according to Calcio Mercato. “This check must be done in short time, then we will decide with the two teams how to proceed.”
Reports are that AC Milan is being a bit more aggressive toward developing a new multi-use stadium.
What would that mean for Inter?
Well, the Nerazzurri have not expressed much interest in developing a new stadium per se. They have discussed developing new training grounds in Milan, but as for a new stadium or even discussing the possibility of leaving the San Siro, there have been no public discussions.
Sala said the city is working with AC Milan first before holding any discussions with Inter Milan ownership about its future.
“We are focused on putting Milan in a place to understand how to build them a new stadium,” he said. “Otherwise it will have to work at the San Siro.”
Discussion over a potential move comes on the heels of Inter officials stating they may have more than 70,000 fans at the San Siro for their Sunday clash with Torino. If that's the case, it would be the second-largest attended game for Inter this season — the first being the Derby della Madonnina in October. It would also be the second-largest attended game in Serie A since 2010.
There is something to be said about a home field advantage in any sport. The question becomes does Inter have that kind of advantage at the San Siro?
I think, because you are sharing space, it kind of takes away from that. There are plenty of two-team cities that have separate stadiums with little issue in filling them. Take Manchester, Liverpool and Madrid for example. All of those cities have two teams and don't have much in the way of an attendance issue.
Now, does Inter or AC Milan need a stadium that sits more than 70,000? No. What would be the best option would be for each team to have their own stadium that seats about 50,000 to 55,000. It would alleviate scheduling issues — as it is very tough for Inter and Milan to play on the same day because they share facilities.
The biggest problem with that is money. It's no secret that AC Milan has opened the checkbook, especially during the mercato, but investing in a stadium is a different animal. It's an animal I am not sure Suning is willing to try to handle.
That said, if Inter were to continue its winning ways this season, it may prompt ownership to invest more in the team's infrastructure.
But, for now, the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza will do.
Forza Inter!
To show how Byzantine the already complex Middle East political debate has become, my take on recent developments there will seem counter-intuitive to my long-standing fans (all three of you). For example, I support - gasp! - the recent U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. "Heresy! Stone him!"
Are rabid members of the GOP - for whom this is the Obamacare of foreign policy - correct in arguing that we did not get a strong enough deal? Absolutely. Should we have secured the release of all American hostages currently held by Iran as a precondition for negotiations? No doubt. Should we have more fully crippled the Iranian economy, so that we could have gotten Tehran to partially withdraw support for terrorist operations in Gaza and Lebanon? Absolutely. Should we have gotten the radical mullahs in Iran to fully recognize Israel and refrain from genocidal threats against our closest ally in the region? You bet. Moreover, should we have held back on releasing any funds until all such conditions were fully met? Of course.
However, like all imperfect deals - such as the SALT treaties with the far more lethal USSR - the U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement, while no treaty (a mistake made by both parties in Congress), does move the ball further down the road towards a non-nuclear Arab and Persian world. I honestly believe it will keep Iran from getting a nuclear bomb for at least eight years, and probably eight more after that. While I fully expect Iran to cheat around the edges, I accept this deal - along with a plurality of American Jews - as an imperfect step in the right nonviolent direction until a stronger deal can be brokered by a future administration.
Yet, despite this modest success on the Iran nuclear front, the Obama administration still has it mostly wrong in the Middle East. This wasn't always the case.
Back in 2008, the true and winning argument made not only by far left supporters of Barack Obama, but by moderate, common sense independents like myself, was that the U.S. had no business deposing Saddam Hussein after 9/11. Saddam, as evil as he was, had nothing to do with that horrific event, whose 14th anniversary we emotionally remembered over a week ago. As I've repeatedly noted since 2003, Saddam feared Islamic extremists as much as we did. His whole purchase on power was that he was strong enough to keep hardcore jihadists at bay, and neighboring Iran in check.
The truth - as the incurious, lockstep group thinkers in the Bush administration failed to see - was that:
1. Saddam was bluffing about WMD to deter internal enemies, Iran, and Islamic extremists. If the emperor was revealed to have no WMD, he would have been quickly and summarily deposed, leaving the power vacuum we now see exploited by ISIS and al Qaeda;
2. The existence of Saddam, and the existence of similar strong men in the historically undemocratic Middle East is precisely what kept Islamic extremism in check for decades;
3. Saddam had zero to do with 9/11.
As several books and investigations have clearly shown, President George W. Bush and his neocon cronies had a preordained plan to take out Saddam. Rather than go full-bore after our real enemies after 9/11, they distracted us into a bit of family payback and preemptive democracy promotion in Iraq.
Even with Bush's blunder, could we still have "won" Iraq had we kept a sizable contingent of military personnel there, as dogmatic revisionists like Dick Cheney hope we now believe? Not a chance. Absent a strong man like Saddam, eventually the rising tide of ISIS and al Qaeda sympathizers would break through precisely because a sizable contingent of Americans remained on Islamic soil.
Moreover, every single attempt to arm, train, and get Iraqi soldiers interested in defending their country have failed miserably. Their hearts are not in the fight, as ISIS gleefully discovered in appropriating huge tranches of American-made weaponry left behind by fleeing Iraqi fighters. Moreover, their divided Iraqi hearts would never have been in the fight no matter how long the U.S. stayed. It was a no-win proposition from the get-go.
Yet, even with this painful and obvious lesson, the Obama foreign policy team - lead by Secretary of State John Kerry, who, like his predecessor Hillary Rodham Clinton, shamefully voted for the deceitfully sold Iraq War - continues to believe that Syria is different. Kerry and Obama actually believe that arming secular Syrians against Assad will work.
It did not work in Iraq. It will not work in Syria. This is because the existence of some large non-theocratic secular democratic fighting force anywhere in the Muslim Middle East is a figment of our American imagination. It does not exist. It never existed, even at the height of the protests in Cairo's Tahir Square, although for a brief, delusional moment an Egyptian-born Google executive convinced us all that it did.
The reason Obama cannot see this is because his opposition to the Iraq War was not grounded in a grasp of historic Mideast realities. As a result, Obama has now weirdly forgotten why he even won the Presidency in 2008. As all exit polls confirmed, it was because he opposed the Iraq War.
What Obama has also forgotten, and what ahistorical Americans too often forget, is that sometimes, in order to deter a larger, more ferocious enemy, we must collaborate with unsavory allies. We built an alliance with Joseph Stalin and the USSR during WWII to defeat the greater threat posed by Hitler's Germany. Similarly, for years we were smart enough to realize that Libya's Gaddafi, Iraq's Hussein, Syria's Assad and Egypt's Mubarak - despite their often-avowed hatred of Israel - were also our bulwark against radical Islam.
Yes, America should always be on the side of democratic reform in the Middle East. I would hope, however, that we are now mature enough to realize that truly representative democracy is a pipe dream in the Arab and Persian world as long as the bulk of reformers want a theocratic version of democracy. By naively deposing Middle Eastern strong men before fully thinking through who or what would appear in their wake (as Bush stupidly did in deposing Saddam, and Obama stupidly did in deposing Gaddafi and Mubarak), we did not usher in some Jeffersonian version of the Arab Spring. Rather, we ushered in a Muslim Brotherhood version of the Arab Spring, or worse.
Obama and his team are so lost in the tribal weeds, and so captured by a delusional faith in secular democratic reform that they waste precious time trying to sort out the nuances between Sunni and Shia, or between anti-Assad non-jihadists and anti-Assad jihadists, when, instead, they should keep their eye on the greatest threat in the region: radical Islamic terror, from whatever Islamic fringe it hails.
That was the threat that faced the U.S. after 9/11 before we got into this futile exercise in preemptive democracy promotion. We need to go back to the RealPolitik thinking that guided our Mideast policy before 9/11, by fighting radical Islam through our "friends" (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and the Kurds) and unsavory foes (Iran, Syria, and, yes, Russia) in the region.
At any one time, there are many bad actors on the world stage. However, some actors are a direct existential threat to the world order itself. Nazism was that threat in 1939. Radical Islam is that threat now.
Therefore, if Russia and Iran want to aid the egregious Bashar al-Assad in helping us contain that threat, we should work with them, not against them. If we aim to defeat ISIS, every single leader in the region agrees: we must hold our noses and work together. The Obama administration's attempt to split the needle by only supporting secular Syrians who are also opposed to Assad is a fool's errand. That needle cannot be split. Attempting to do so will only strengthen ISIS, bringing even greater chaos and suffering.
Only after ISIS is fully crushed in Syria (and hopefully in Iraq) can we even begin to discuss how to deal with Assad, rebuild Syria, and create a safe zone for returning Syrian refugees.
A House committee is seeking charges for the IT company that managed Hillary Clinton's private email server. The matter is being referred to the Justice Department for obstruction of justice and making false statements.
Via The Daily Caller:
Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, issued the referral for Treve Suazo, the CEO of Platte River Networks.
House aides participating in a conference call with reporters on Thursday said that Platte River “flatly refused” to honor two subpoenas for documents related to its work on Clinton's server.
According to the aides, Datto asked Platte River to take steps to encrypt the information on the server, which was stored at a data center in New Jersey.
“We didn't see any evidence that those encryption measures were taken,” the aides said.
The aides also said that a Platte River technician, Paul Combetta, received at least 50 alerts about hacking attempts on Clinton's server originating from Korea, Germany, France and the U.S.
The aides said that Combetta responded to those email alerts by asking to be removed from the alert system.
Combetta was one of two Platte River Networks employees who pleaded the Fifth during a House hearing last September. Bill Thornton, another technician, refused to testify at a House Oversight Committee hearing about their work on Clinton's server.
Combetta also lied to the FBI during one of his interviews about his work on Clinton's server. Despite that, he was granted immunity from the Justice Department in order to cooperate with the investigation.

PinkNews Exclusive
In a rare move, a British Parliamentary Candidate has come out as transgender, in an interview with PinkNews.
Labour's Emily Brothers – who is standing for Parliament in Sutton and Cheam – has opened up about being transgender.
Ms Brothers – who lost her sight to glaucoma as a child – was a key figure in securing Disability Living Allowance for blind people, and has opened up about her gender transition for the first time.
She told PinkNews: “In an ideal world I wouldn't be speaking out about my past because it's very private; however I recognise that as a politician the key thing is trust.
“I don't want to be somebody who has notoriety as having a transgender background, but I also believe it's an experience that has value to it, that I can be a positive role model.
“For a lot of people of a transgender experience that can be very challenging but for me, it was absolutely the right thing to do. I am happy and content as a woman, and also as a gay woman.
“I have two great children who are very supportive, but my wider family are not and have broken their connections with me.”
She added: “There is vast under-representation of disabled people and people with transgender experience in public life, and there is of course vast under-representation of women in parliament, and that needs to change.”
The Prospective Parliamentary candidate also spoke about how trans people and disabled people often face similar issues in accessing health care and that improving care was one of the main reasons she is standing for parliament.
She said: “Because of my disability I have always been a user of NHS services. I was one of those children who spent a lot of time in hospital for operation after operation to retain the little sight I had.
“That experience taught me a lot about the value and the importance of the NHS.”
While there have been openly trans local councillors, and Nikki Sinclaire who represented UKIP at the European Parliament before leaving the party, this is believed to be the first time a Parliamentary Candidate for a major party has come out as transgender without being outed.
A Lib Dem PPC Stephanie Dearden was outed as transgender in 2005 by the Daily Mail.
Read the full interview below:
PinkNews talks to Emily Brothers, the first openly transgender Parliamentary Candidate to come out of their own accord and stand for one of the major political parties in the UK.
Ms Brothers, who is standing for Parliament as a Labour candidate in Sutton and Cheam, opened up about her gender transition for the first time.
The Prospective Parliamentary Candidate lost her sight to glaucoma as a child – and was a key figure in securing Disability Living Allowance for blind people.
What led you to wanting to speak out today?
In an ideal world I wouldn't be speaking out about my past because it's very private; however I recognise that as a politician the key thing is trust. We have a situation in Britain where politicians have been losing trust with people, and if I'm not honest about my life experience people may be critical of me being secretive.
I've always been passionate about politics about making a difference, being an equality campaigner and more broadly in terms of fairness and justice. If I'm going to be doing that with credibility it is important for me to be open.
I don't want to be somebody who has notoriety as having a transgender background, but I also believe it's an experience that has value to it, that I can be a positive role model.
There is also the fear that those who like to judge people with different background may at some point choose to run a story on me in a negative light. There have been plenty of examples where people have suffered because of that, to the extent where some people have taken their own lives. Although a lot of people are supportive, there are people out there who are very negative.
I don't want it to define my future, but I want it to be something which is part of my identity. I need to be honest about my background and embrace it.
Hopefully some positive will come from it, not just for me but for other people who have gender identity issues or backgrounds.
In what ways does your background influence your politics now, and how do you think it will in the future?
I'm deeply committed to campaigning right across the equality spectrum. I think that stems both from my gender identity experience and my experience as a disabled woman.
My background is what drives me to fight for fairness for me and other people. In terms of my working class background, I was very much deeply rooted in Labour values.
Do you think trans and disability issues overlap, and in what sort of ways?
For disabled people and for some people with a transgender experience there are issues around barriers. Particularly institutional barriers, where policies and procedures may prevent people from fulfilling their lives.
For disabled people this could be in terms of accessing buildings or information, for transgender people it might be in terms of accessing the right health support or particular facilities.
Of course there are disabled people who experience hate crime, particularly people with learning disabilities, and there are many people with a transgender experience who experience hate crime, bullying and harassment.
There are some common issues about institutional discrimination, and issues about attitude, and often its people's misconceptions, not understanding, and their prejudice about people who are different.
What inspired you to stand for election?
I have become particularly frustrated with this coalition government. Disabled people and other disadvantaged groups have really been hit by the coalition.
Because of my disability I have always been a user of NHS services and so I'm particularly interested in the NHS. I was one of those children who spent a lot of time in hospital for operation after operation to retain the little sight I had. That experience taught me a lot about the value and the importance of the NHS, particularly what front line staff do and how valuable it is. Without it I would have suffered more significantly.
At the end of the day, they weren't able to save my sight, but they made a valiant effort.
I feel passionately about health, and that's why I spoke out very strongly at the Labour party conference this year in Manchester. And why I attacked my Lib Dem opponent Paul Burstow MP, the former healthcare minister. He was involved in piloting the Health and Social Care Act 2012 that brought in competition.
We need to take out competition framework in the health system. We need to get back to raising clinical standards.
What are the biggest issues facing trans people at the moment?
The first thing to say is I'm not a representative of the trans community. However, I am aware from my experience that there are a lot of issues about access to health services. In terms of counselling support and in terms of access to treatment in order to align people to their correct gender.
Many transgender people also experience harassment and that is something that needs to be challenged and tackled. A lot of transgender people find it difficult to retain employment; they may have housing and other social challenges.
There is vast under-representation of disabled people and people with transgender experience in public life, and there is of course vast under-representation of women in parliament, and that needs to change. That mean people like me stepping forward, and some people will find that difficult.
I'm fortunate that I have an ex-wife who is very supportive and understanding, I have two great children who are very supportive, but my wider family are not and have broken their connections with me.
For a lot of people of a transgender experience that can be very challenging but for me, it was absolutely the right thing to do. I am happy and content as a woman, and also as a gay woman.
As a blind person, one of the biggest barriers is a lack of access to information. I grew up in a world without computers. I wasn't able to pick up information off the shelf in a library or in a shop and access it independently.
Information on Braille and tape is limited. I was from a very traditional working class background. My family didn't understand those issues and I didn't feel able or confident to talk about those issues.
It was only with the internet that I was able to explore and find out so much more information. I wasn't the only person like this in the world and that was revolutionary to me.
The only way I could continue was going through transition and living my life as Emily.
Freedom of Information reply from the New York City Department of Buildings reports that copies of city permits for routine or major construction work within World Trade Center building 7 during the years 1999, 2000 and 2001 could not be located. Records for the “ALT 2” category were requested.
“DOB divides construction work into two main categories: New Buildings (NB) and Alterations (ALT). Alterations are further divided into three types—ALT1s, ALT2s and ALT3s—depending upon the scope of work. An ALT1 is a major alteration in which the use or occupancy of an existing property changes. An ALT2 is an alteration in which the use or occupancy of a facility does not change, but includes multiple work types, i.e., plumbing and construction. ALT1s and ALT2s must be filed by a registered architect or licensed engineer."

Charles Robberts Swart, DMS (5 December 1894 – 16 July 1982), nicknamed Blackie[4] was a South African politician who served as the last Governor-General of Union of South Africa from 1959 to 1961 and the first State President of the Republic of South Africa from 1961 to 1967.
Early life [ edit ]
Swart was born on 5 December 1894 on the farm Morgenzon, in the Winburg district, part of the Boer republic of the Orange Free State (which became a British colony in 1902 and a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910).[5]
He was the third of six children, born to Hermanus Bernardus Swart (1866–1949) and Aletta Catharina Robberts (1870–1929). The Anglo Boer War (Second Boer War) broke out when he was 5 years old. During the war his mother and the children were interned at the Winburg concentration camp. Of the three boys only two survived the concentration camp. His father was wounded and captured by the British during the Battle of Paardeberg. He became a prisoner of war and stayed in Groenpunt and Simonstad until the end of the war.
When Swart was 7 years old he went to the government school in Winburg. He later went to a C.N.O. school, which is a school set up by the Afrikaners in response to Lord Milner's anglicisation policy at the government sponsored schools. Later on, the schools merged again with the result that he move up a grade. He was only 13 years old when he passed his higher exam (matric or last year of school).
He established himself as a barrister in 1914. He spent a brief period in Hollywood acting in silent films, before embarking on his public career. He practised law in Bloemfontein from 1919 to 1948. He earned a degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 1921–1922. He reported briefly from Washington for the Die Burger newspaper.[6]
He was married to Cornelia Wilhelmina (Nellie) de Klerk and had three children. He was a tall man at 6 feet and 7 inches.
Public life [ edit ]
In 1923 he was elected to the House of Assembly as Member of Parliament for Ladybrand until he was defeated in 1938. He became leader of the National Party in the Orange Free State and MP for Winburg in 1939. As a staunch republican, he was a member of the National Party for many years. During the war he was well known as being a fascist sympathiser. After the war he was appointed Minister of Justice when the National Party came to power in 1948, and was responsible for legislation to strengthen the powers of the South African Police to suppress anti-apartheid activity. Several figures in the Congress of Democrats were imprisoned for exposing his earlier links with fascism. From 1949–1950 he held the portfolio for Education, Arts and Science and became acting Prime Minister in 1958.
Swart was appointed Governor-General in 1960. Like his predecessor, Dr Jansen, he declined to take the oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II or to wear the ceremonial uniform. In a referendum later that year, a small majority of White voters endorsed a government proposal to establish a republic. In 1961, after signing the new republican constitution passed by Parliament, he asked the Queen to release him from office, and Parliament then elected him as State President, the new post which replaced the monarch and the governor-general as ceremonial head of state. Nelson Mandela and other underground black resistance leaders tried to protest against the change of government to the new republican, Afrikaner-dominated system by planning a three-day general strike of non-white workers, but the government preemptively averted most of these plans through an extensive use of police force to persecute the dissenters.[7]
Although elected for a seven-year term office, Swart served as State President for only six years, and retired in 1967. He died on 16 July 1982, aged 87. Swart was popularly known as "Blackie" (Swart is Afrikaans for "black").[4][8][9][10]
Legacy [ edit ]
The tallest building in Bloemfontein, South Africa (CR Swart Building), which houses the provincial administration and various governmental departments was named after him. This building is also known as 'The Pride of the Free State' and houses a revolving restaurant on the 26th floor.
In the new dispensation, under the ANC led government in 2015 the popular CR Swart Building was renamed the Fidel Castro Building.[11]
A statue of CR Swart at the University of the Free State was destroyed by protesting students in late February 2016.[12]
The highest peak in the remote Prince Edward Islands is State President Swart Peak.

Is mead the oldest fermented drink? Maybe, says Brian Rutzen, Cider Director, at The Northman Cider Pub & Bistro in Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood.
What is mead, and why are we just now starting to see its rise on bar menus?
“The trend toward ‘craft' food and drinks has been well underway for decades,” says Rutzen. “Organic and locally-sourced foods, beer made by your friends, artisan distilleries, inventive cocktail recipes, and now the recent rise of cider have all been a part of rediscovering lost traditions and searching for new horizons. It was only a matter of time before this new generation of thoughtful beverage makers turned their attention towards mead.”
As we witnessed with craft beer's explosion, mead it's starting to take off as more people want to experiment with new flavors and ingredients. In mead's case, honey plays a starring role and one of the reasons mead might have come to be.
“Many fruits and vegetables were often kept in jars of honey as a way to preserve fresh foods,” explains Rutzen. “Over time and exposure to natural yeasts, the honey fermented and created the first alcoholic substance. The rest is history.”
Mead, is should be noted, is sometimes referred to as honey wine since the majority of fermentable sugar comes from honey. “It has some properties and notes similar to champagne, but usually sweeter and more viscous,” describes Rutzen, who adds that one can also blend honey with fruit juice (melomel) or spices (methaglin) to make it lighter and balance out the sweetness. The ABV usually ranges from 6 - 20%, with an average of around 11%, he adds.
Finding it on the menu isn't always easy, although it's certainly getting easier than more bars are starting to stock one or two brands and more meaderies open and bartenders experiment. It's also a popular alternative to beer for those who are gluten-intolerant since mead is fermented honey and water or juice in its natural form. Note, though, that braggots marries mead and beer, meaning it might include malt, hops or yeast which will be problematic for those with a gluten intolerance.
The American Mead Makers Association has a whole area on their website dedicated to those interested in opening a meadery and the HomebrewersAssociation.org includes a section on Mead Making on its site, for home brewing enthusiasts.
For those seeking to try it, seek out bars with a respectable cider offerings. Of the 22 cider lines at The Northman, one has always been dedicated to draught mead. Wild Blossom Meadery and Winery offers a Mead Club for 3, 6 and 12-months that sends two new bottles selected for members.
“In mid-February, we will launch a new ‘by-the-glass' program offering several options for bottled meads,” adds Rutzen. “They can range in flavor profiles, from hopped blackberry or chili pepper meads, to a modern take on an Arnold Palmer, by blending honey with lemon juice and black tea.”
He admits that his guests tend to already be adventurous drinkers, and are eager to explore mead as well.
“In many ways, it is the happy medium between a cider and a cocktail,” he says. “The wild flavor combinations could even lend themselves as welcome additions to creative new cocktail recipes.”
For an object lesson to future national finals producers on how NOT to put together the process of finding your winner, you should look not further than Spain's little end of show farrago last night. It had already been a pretty weak and over-long event, with an interminably long stretch between the songs finishing and the scores coming in, and not even a mini-jukebox musical of past Spanish Eurovisios and a surprise performance from a delightfully creaky Karina could lure your attention away from the other three screens you doubtlessly had open at the same time.But when it did finally come to the voting, oh boy did they cod it up!The judges came first. For some time before the final it had become clear that two of the three of them favoured the floppy-haired beach squirt Manel for the ticket to Kiev. So it wasn't then surprising that they both put him firmly at the top of their piles. However, it was a little more suspect when they both put the crowd-pleasing fan love sponge Mirela plumb last on their lists. Stranger still that they both offered exactly the same order of acts with their votes. The middle judge looked noticably put out at their judgement, and bunged Mirela at the top of his heap. At the end of this process, when the crowd started to cotton on what was going on, you could clearly hear the booing from the rowdy crowd.Then came the public votes. With Manel only coming third in the public poll, with was suddenly apparent that whoever came top of this vote would tie with Manel at the head of the leaderboard. And then what would happen. The wardrobe-like host began to look nervous as he read out the results. With the pre-match favourite LeKlein being called out first, it was suddenly clear that Manel and Mirela had tied at the top. For one long, acheing moment, not a single human in the place knew what to do, and the now-angry crowd began beying Mirela's name.Then, in a move rarely seen in a national final, they chose the jury to decide the winner, and not the public vote. Well it was clear where this was going, and the booing and cat-calling only got louder, and upon his inevitable win, Manel looked visibly put out by the events as he prepared for his reprise. Heck someone had even hidden his guitar.Even in these days of hooky East European results it is unusual for flawed voting system to be so blindingly apparent. It wasn't as if either song was especially good, but Mirela's Euroclub bop was clearly going to find more favour among the fans in the hall. Reports abound of the offending jury members being jostled on their way out of the studio.It all made Sanremo look rather staid and organised...

About the Project
The State Integrity Investigation II project is a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity. This new effort will refine and update a project first carried out in 2011-2012. At the time, the project represented the first in-depth, data-driven account of government transparency and anti-corruption mechanisms in all 50 states, using on-the-ground reporting and data analysis. A list of detailed questions, or “integrity indicators”, is answered through a combination of evidence-based research and interviews with knowledgeable experts, used to generate scorecards for each state.
The State Integrity Investigation was featured in more than 1,100 print, online and broadcast outlets across the country. Since then, it has led to the adoption of new laws or statutes in seven states and proposals in five more. The project was a 2013 finalist for Harvard's Goldsmith Investigative Reporting Prize. A new round of research will allow states to measure any progress they have made, will raise the pressure for passing reforms and will serve as a critical tool for state government reporters, lawmakers and civil society across the country.
Position of the Peer Reviewer
Peer Reviewers will play a key role in the data quality control process by carefully reading, vetting and fact-checking the information submitted by the Lead Researcher. Peer Reviewers are typically governance experts, academics, journalists or civil society leaders with specific expertise and deep knowledge of specific governance areas. They must have an excellent grasp of the state's transparency, accountability and anti-corruption mechanisms.
Peer Reviewers will provide substantive feedback on the indicators' accuracy, relevance and balance and must have substantive knowledge in a number of the below issue areas: Freedom of Information, Political Finance, Electoral Oversight, Executive (Legislative and Judicial) Accountability, State Auditing, State Budgeting Process, Civil Service Management, Procurement, Ethics Agencies and the State Pension System. In some cases, Peer Reviewers will have to provide additional research and sources to make the data quality-compliant.
Timing and required Availability
Peer Reviewers will review the data during March 2015 – June 2015 and will have seven days (sharp!) to review and provide feedback on the 250 indicators. As it is impossible to estimate when a particular scorecard will become available, Peer Reviewers must be available for a quick turn-around any time during that period and must be available to promptly clarify any aspect of their review throughout May and June 2015.
Compensation
All work is compensated. All contributors to the project will be publicly acknowledged.
State coverage
Global Integrity is looking for Peer Reviewers in all 50 States.
How to apply
Interested candidates, including those who have worked with Global Integrity before, should apply online here.
Positions are filled on a rolling basis.

South Africa need to beat Lebanon by 29 points tomorrow (31st October) in the second leg of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup Qualifier – MEA, in Brakpan, Pretoria, if they are to progress to the Antipodes. The Cedars triumphed 40-12 in the first leg on the same ground and go into the game confident of making their first World Cup since 2000.
South Africa have been without head coach Brian Greige for most of the week following his pre-arranged trip back to Australia to complete a high performance qualification. Assistant Drikkies Mulder has been responsible for preparing the side in his absence and Rupert Wells comes into the squad, replacing Nardus Raubenheimer, while highly rated 19-year-old play-maker Ruaan Du Preez looks to have recovered from a knee injury that prevented his selection last week. South Africa missed his goal-kicking ability, failing with all three attempts last time out.
“After Sunday's game the Rhino players had a lot of small injuries,” said Mulder. “On Monday we had a good recovery session and overall we've had a hard week at practice, with a lot of defence and communication drills. The players had a good and hard talk about the job at hand this Saturday and there is a positive attitude in the Rhino camp.”
Lebanon goes into the game without talismanic co-captain Ray Moujalli but in relaxed mood. Moujalli, the popular Newtown Jets front rower, suffered a deep gash to his knee which will keep him out for several weeks. He has been replaced by veteran utility player Ead Kassem in Darren Maroon's 19-man-squad.
“Preparations have been good,” said Lebanon assistant coach Chris Salem. “We are settled in here [at Pretoria's High Performance Centre] after a few days acclimatising to the conditions. The facilities are great and the boys are looking well.
“It took a couple of days for them to get over Sunday's match, which was played under a hot sun and on a hard ground, but they are feeling bright and ready to go. We have not been too worried about the team getting carried away. Everybody's focusing on the task at hand and what they are doing. There's absolutely no issue with us thinking the job is done at all.”
The match, which kicks off at 3pm local time at the Bosman Stadium, Brakpan, will be available to view via livestream:

Joe Rogan unleashing a brutally true perspective on the ‘society trap' that so many people unknowingly fall into. From exchanging goods directly in self sufficient societies based on contribution to, in Joe Rogan's words:
“Selling your life to sit in a box and work for a machine. An uncaring machine that demands productivity that doesn't understand you and doesn't want to understand you.”…”There's no natural behaviour. Everyone is wearing clothes they don't want to wear. Everybody is showing up and doing something they don't want to do. They have no connection to it. That's the problem with our society… And then what's the reward for all this stuff? Go home and get a big TV. Go home your going to get a shiny belt buckle. Your going to get that dream car. Every week we're chasing down this new object and every week we are trying to fill this hole in this sad shadow of a life we've been left with after work. That you worked 8 to whatever hours a day plus commuting and that is your life, that's your real fucking life. And most of us have committed to that and we understand that it's a trap because we got out of it. But for the people that are in it, alot of the time they don't even understand it's a trap”
Quite possibly the most powerful 6 minute lecture on society that's on the internet.
But, what do you think? Comment below and let us know.

WEDGED behind the Casa Rosada, Argentina's presidential palace, the Museo del Bicentenario (bicentenary museum) tells the story of the country's leaders since the revolution against Spanish rule in 1810. Until recently, half its floorspace was devoted to exhibits about Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who was president when she opened the museum in 2011, and her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, who preceded her in office. On display were Kirchner's trademark loafers and a football shirt emblazoned with the legend “100% K”. Founding fathers like Domingo Sarmiento, Argentina's seventh president, were “practically non-existent” says Luciano de Privitellio, director of cultural programmes at the Casa Rosada.
On the orders of Ms Fernández's recently elected successor, Mauricio Macri, the museum has undergone a seven-week overhaul; it reopened on June 28th. Mr Privitellio claims it is now more even-handed. All of Argentina's former presidents, including brutal 20th-century dictators, are represented with paintings, video screens and artefacts (Sarmiento's desk and the dinner jacket of Carlos Menem, for example). “You can't leave out the ones you don't like,” says Mr Privitellio.

The rearrangement is part of a broader effort to banish the soft cult of personality that Ms Fernández had created around herself and her husband, who died in 2010. It's a big job—166 public spaces are named after Kirchner, according to Clarín, a newspaper. His body lies in a three-storey cement mausoleum in Río Gallegos, in the province of Santa Cruz, which he governed. Visitors can look down reverentially upon his coffin, an idea borrowed from Napoleon's tomb. Last year Ms Fernández inaugurated the Néstor Kirchner Cultural Centre (CCK), housed in a palace in Buenos Aires that once served as the headquarters of the post office.
Rather than knocking the monuments down, the government is changing their purpose. It dropped the idea of renaming the CCK, but closed its “Néstor Kirchner experience”, an exhibition that extolled the late president's deeds. A marble image of Kirchner, unveiled by Ms Fernández at the entrance to the Casa Rosada on her last day in office, has joined the chronologically arranged row of presidential busts (from which the dictators have been culled).
The downgrading extends to figures venerated by the populist Peronist movement, founded by the mid-20th-century strongman Juan Perón, to which the Kirchners belong. Mr Privitellio has removed portraits and photographs of 43 leftist luminaries, including Che Guevara and Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Especially painful to Ms Fernández must be the desanctifying of Eva “Evita” Perón, Juan's popular wife, who died young. Her image, etched on 100-peso notes since 2012, is to be replaced next year by that of a Taruca, an Andean deer.
Kirchneristas detect authoritarian impulses behind the restoration of dictators' portraits and the removal of leftist imagery. They accuse Mr Macri of erasing the Kirchners from history in order to write his own version. If his government “could ban the letter K from the alphabet, they would”, Ms Fernández fumed.
Argentines will not soon put back the symbols that Mr Macri is taking down. Ms Fernández and her coterie have been at the centre of corruption scandals since she left office. On June 14th José López, a former public-works minister, was caught by police hurling nearly $9m in cash over the wall of a convent, apparently intending to bury it on the convent's grounds. Ms Fernández says this has nothing to do with her, but nearly 64% of Argentines doubt that, according to a recent poll. No one has written a musical about Ms Fernández, but she is in no danger of being forgotten.
Create something. Beef up your portfolio. Be proud!
Want to know how most developers get a job at Google, Twitter, Facebook or the like? They create great projects.
What better way to beef up your portfolio than build a game, a language, a framework from scratch? You'll do all that in the club.
Real, impressive projects, from scratch
Each project re-implements a library, framework or tool you use daily as a developer.
The best way to understand something is to recreate it. The great physicist, Richard Feynman, said is best: “What I cannot create, I do not understand“
All projects are implemented from scratch. Meaning, we won't use any library doing all the work. We'll rebuild the full thing!
Kick-start your own project
The club projects are designed to help you get started on your own projects. Although they are presented using JavaScript, instructions are pointers are given to help them port to other languages.
Many people have already used the projects in the club as a foundation to build their own impressive projects. Here are a few of them.
Fall in love with coding all over again
Learning is important and all, but why do you want to write code for a living? Because it's so much fun! You can create stuff from nothing in a matter of minutes, polish your code into a piece of art and explore your creativity.
The Bolshoy Ice Dome, to be used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, seen during sunrise on October 25, 2013.
WASHINGTON — The United States will not be sending any of its top officials — either President or Mrs. Obama or Vice President or Dr. Biden — to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, as part of its delegation to the games.
A former federal official, Janet Napolitano, will instead be leading the U.S. delegation, the White House announced Tuesday, and two out LGBT athletes — Billie Jean King and Caitlin Cahow — will be a part of the delegation as well.
In addition to the Obamas and Bidens not attending the Olympics, no current cabinet members will be a part of the country's delegation either.
"The U.S. Delegation to the Olympic Games represents the diversity that is the United States," White House spokesman Shin Inouye told BuzzFeed. "All our delegation members are distinguished by their accomplishments in government service, civic activism, and sports. We are proud of each and every one of them and think they will serve as great ambassadors of the United States to the Olympic Games."
The highest ranking officials in the delegation will be Rob Nabors, the assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for policy, attending the opening ceremony, and William J. Burns, the deputy secretary of the State Department, leading the delegation at the closing ceremony.
The news came with less than two months until the opening ceremony is slated to take place on Feb. 7, 2014, and signaled the continued U.S. disagreement with Russia's anti-LGBT laws and other human rights concerns.
The Presidential Delegation to the Opening Ceremony of the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games will include Napolitano; Nabors; Michael A. McFaul, the United States ambassador to the Russian Federation; King, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, member of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, as well as a former Olympic tennis coach; and Brian A. Boitano, an Olympic gold medalist in figure skating.
The Presidential Delegation to the Closing Ceremony of the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games on February 23, 2014, led by Burns, will also include McFaul; Bonnie Blair, five-time Olympic gold medalist and one-time bronze medalist in speed skating; Cahow, Olympic silver medalist and bronze medalist in women's ice hockey; and Eric Heiden, five-time Olympic gold medalist in speed skating.
'Warcraft' is falling fast in the Middle Kingdom, following the path of nearly every studio tentpole this year, while the animated opening for 'Dory' marks a studio best for Pixar.
Legendary Entertainment's Warcraft suffered huge attrition during its second weekend charge at Chinese cinemas, but the local sensation still managed to top Pixar's Finding Dory, which debuted in the Middle Kingdom on Friday.
The Duncan Jones-directed video game adaptation earned $23.5 million in its second Friday-Sunday frame (including a solid $8 million on Sunday), which represents a 64 percent drop from last weekend's $65 million three-day weekend total. Warcraft has grossed $205 million after 12 days in Chinese cinemas, which compares to just $37 million in 10 days on North American screens.
Assessing Warcraft's decline in China is somewhat complicated by the unique window in which it opened, however. The movie bowed to an astonishing $46 million on Wednesday June 8, the day before a national holiday in China. According to local convention, the following Sunday then became a work day. If you consider the full Wednesday-to-Sunday stretch Warcraft's opening weekend — as Legendary did when it announced the total, the movie opened to $156 million, and its second weekend saw an 85 percent slide.
However you parse it, Warcraft is clearly experiencing the big-splash, big-crash pattern followed by nearly every Hollywood tentpole in China this year. Captain America: Civil War, for example, opened to a huge $96 million back in May, only to slide 67 percent to $31.7 million in its second weekend. The only major outlier to the trend was Zootopia, which was boosted by effusive word of mouth and grossed more in its second weekend than its first, eventually totaling $235.5 million, the biggest performance by an imported title this year. With Independence Day: Resurgence coming to China on Wednesday, it's unclear whether Warcraft will be able to claim that crown.
In second place, Finding Dory opened to a healthy $17.5 million, making for Pixar's best bow ever in China. While that's nowhere near Dory's historic $136.2 million U.S. bow, Disney and Pixar are probably pleased with the Middle Kingdom returns so far.
Animation has been on a hot streak in China lately. Aside from Zootopia, Kung Fu Panda 3 pulled in $154.3 million and The Angry Birds Movie earned $77.7 million. But in the past, Pixar's pictures have been conspicuous underperformers with the Chinese audience, which hasn't seemed to connect with the whimsy and emotional subtlety that the animation studio is famed for. Inside Out grossed just $16.1 million; Monsters University earned a studio-best $33.8 million in China — but that compares with Minions' $68.4 million in China last year, or the $65.1 million earned by How to Train Your Dragon 2 in 2014. Now, it looks like Dory's cute factor and kid appeal could finally help Pixar break the spell.
In third place, 20th Century Fox's X-Men Apocalypse added $8.7 million for a $114.6 million total over 17 days. In local currency, Apocalypse (732 million RMB) has now exceeded X-Men: Days of Future Past's lifetime cume (723 million RMB) to become the franchise's biggest title in China.
The remaining spots on the charts were occupied with exiguous grosses by holdovers and minor new releases.
But Washington is providing only a trickle of help, and even that grudgingly. We must place priority on reducing the deficit, say Republicans and “centrist” Democrats. And then, virtually in the next breath, they declare that we must preserve tax cuts for the very affluent, at a budget cost of $700 billion over the next decade.
In effect, a large part of our political class is showing its priorities: given the choice between asking the richest 2 percent or so of Americans to go back to paying the tax rates they paid during the Clinton-era boom, or allowing the nation's foundations to crumble — literally in the case of roads, figuratively in the case of education — they're choosing the latter.

It's a disastrous choice in both the short run and the long run.
In the short run, those state and local cutbacks are a major drag on the economy, perpetuating devastatingly high unemployment.
It's crucial to keep state and local government in mind when you hear people ranting about runaway government spending under President Obama . Yes, the federal government is spending more, although not as much as you might think. But state and local governments are cutting back. And if you add them together, it turns out that the only big spending increases have been in safety-net programs like unemployment insurance , which have soared in cost thanks to the severity of the slump.

That is, for all the talk of a failed stimulus, if you look at government spending as a whole you see hardly any stimulus at all. And with federal spending now trailing off, while big state and local cutbacks continue, we're going into reverse.
But isn't keeping taxes for the affluent low also a form of stimulus? Not so you'd notice. When we save a schoolteacher's job, that unambiguously aids employment; when we give millionaires more money instead, there's a good chance that most of that money will just sit idle.
And what about the economy's future? Everything we know about economic growth says that a well-educated population and high-quality infrastructure are crucial. Emerging nations are making huge efforts to upgrade their roads, their ports and their schools. Yet in America we're going backward.
How did we get to this point? It's the logical consequence of three decades of antigovernment rhetoric, rhetoric that has convinced many voters that a dollar collected in taxes is always a dollar wasted, that the public sector can't do anything right.
The antigovernment campaign has always been phrased in terms of opposition to waste and fraud — to checks sent to welfare queens driving Cadillacs, to vast armies of bureaucrats uselessly pushing paper around. But those were myths, of course; there was never remotely as much waste and fraud as the right claimed. And now that the campaign has reached fruition, we're seeing what was actually in the firing line: services that everyone except the very rich need, services that government must provide or nobody will, like lighted streets, drivable roads and decent schooling for the public as a whole.

So the end result of the long campaign against government is that we've taken a disastrously wrong turn. America is now on the unlit, unpaved road to nowhere.
GET and POST are http operations.
Sending values by using the ? as a separator in the url is different but related. eg:
foo.com/page.php?val1=1&val2=2
The values are called Query String values.
For GET operations, values are sent as a query string values. For POST operations, the values are sent in the body of the POST request. This is why POST must be used when a lot of data is being sent to the server. (Query strings have a maximum length, HTTP requests do not.)
You can do a POST operation to a url that includes query string values. This is more common with Ajax requests but can be done in a form as well. Just set the action url to something like index.php?val1=1&val2=2 the form's (additional) values will be sent as the http body. Remember to set method="post" in the form.
Note that you will need to create the query string yourself in this example, including escaping it properly.
Repeating value names in the query string values
Usually this causes both values to be sent, but the server overwrites the variable and ends up only presenting the last one to the client software.
So if you use a url such as
<a href="http://localhost/index.php?get=abc&post=cde&post=efg">
// It will be decoded by php and most server-side frameworks as
set get to abc
set post to cde
set post to efg
Result: 2 variables, get and post

Wayne Rooney insists that Everton are the only Premier League club he would play for if he left Manchester United.
The England striker made the admission as he thanked both clubs for helping to making his summer testimonial happen on August 3.
Rooney, 30, will donate all the cash from his Old Trafford game to a range of charities including Alder Hey Children's hospital and Claire House hospice on Merseyside.
The former Blues prodigy, who left Goodison for £26m in 2004, said: "For me there could not be a more special testimonial match.
"Manchester United and Everton are the only clubs I have played for as a professional footballer. I am happy to say now that, whatever may happen in the future, I will never play for another Premier League club.
“I owe United and Everton everything for giving me my footballing opportunities. Through the Wayne Rooney Foundation I want to put something back and, at the same time, say a heartfelt thanks to everyone at these great clubs who ever helped me in my career.
“Everton and United, along with my family, gave me the support and opportunity to help me achieve my goals and dreams. Having a young family of my own makes me realise it's vital that every child gets the opportunity to grow up surrounded by love and support to give them a chance of fulfilling their potential.
“I hope The Wayne Rooney Foundation and its charity partners can improve and inspire the lives of children disadvantaged by family breakdown, abuse, health issues or lack of educational opportunities.”
Rooney's relationship with the fan-base of the club he grew up supporting became fraught in the years after his departure, but has improved in recent times.
He was applauded when he returned to Goodison last August to play in Duncan Ferguson's testimonial, and wear the Blue shirt once again. And the Three Lions captain has taken son Kai to watch games at Goodison.
Everton chairman Bill Kenwright said he was thrilled to be able to help with Rooney's special game. “I couldn't be more proud today of the young man who I first saw as an extraordinary 13-year-old," he said.
"I was thrilled for him last August when Goodison Park showed him its admiration as he ran on to the pitch for his first hero, Duncan Ferguson's testimonial.
"Subsequently, it was one of the easiest decisions we have ever made at Everton in agreeing to support Wayne's testimonial by playing Manchester United at Old Trafford this August.
"We will try to win, Wayne, I promise you – but we will nonetheless be saluting one of our own who has gone on to become one of sport's great icons. And who still retains all of the genius, passion, and love for the game that was there when he was thirteen.”
Toffees skipper Phil Jagielka is looking forward to the occasion. He said: "I am delighted to be involved. It's fantastic that he has chosen to play against us.
“Obviously, he was given his chance by [Everton] and it's nice that he feels it will be a fantastic game and that we can put a show on.
“Hopefully, we can raise a lot of money for the charities and everyone has a fantastic day. It's a fantastic feat to have done what he's done in the game and I am really looking forward to playing in the game and hopefully getting the win as well.”
The game will mark the start of a year of fundraising events by Rooney's Foundation aimed at raising £5m for disadvantaged and vulnerable children.
It will also give fans their first chance to see Jose Mourinho's new-look Manchester United at the Theatre of Dreams in what will be the first fully competitive pre-season fixture to be played at United's home ground for two years.
Mourinho said: “Wayne is and has been England's best player for over a decade and this game will be a fitting tribute to everything he has achieved.
"I'm looking forward to what will be a very special night for us both. I'm sure the fans will make this a memorable occasion and help Wayne to raise a lot of money to help support vulnerable children.”
Tickets for the Wayne Rooney Testimonial Match between Manchester United and Everton on 3 August are available today from £25 for Adults and just £10 for under-16‘s.
The game will kick off at 8pm.
Those wishing to donate to The Wayne Rooney Foundation to help its work through its partner charities can also do so by visiting: www.mydonate.bt.com/charities/waynerooneyfoundation
David Pastor, CEO of Claire House Children's Hospice, said: “Nothing can be more traumatic than the death of a child. Thanks to the Wayne Rooney Foundation we will be able to reach more families helping them smile when life couldn't get any tougher.“
Clare White CEO of Alder Hey Children‘s Charity, said: “Wayne, Coleen and their families have been amazing supporters for many years. The Wayne Rooney Foundation will provide funds which will enable us deliver more unique and innovative programmes of care for children in the North West.”
Mary Gonzalez broke barriers when she became her state's only openly lesbian lawmaker when she was elected to the Texas House of Representatives.
Now, however, Gonzalez is going even further, telling the Dallas Voice that she instead identifies herself as "pansexual." As ThinkProgress notes, Gonzalez's admission makes her perhaps the only openly pansexual elected U.S. official.
Though many might describe Gonzalez's orientation as bisexual, pansexuals don't believe in a "gender binary," and hence can be attracted to all gender identities.
Gonzalez specified to the Voice that she doesn't believe in a gender binary because “gender identity isn't the defining part of my attraction," and that she never fully embraced the term "lesbian." Although she came out as bisexual at age 21, Gonzalez said she has also dated transgender and "gender-queer" people, in addition to women.
"During the campaign if I had identified as pansexual, I would have overwhelmed everyone," she said. "Now that I'm out of the campaign, I'm completely much more able to define it."
Gonzalez, who reportedly beat two opponents in the Democrat primary and has no opponent in the fall, continued: "As I started to recognize the gender spectrum and dated along the gender spectrum, I was searching for words that connected to that reality, for words that embraced the spectrum. At the time I didn't feel as if the term bisexual was encompassing of a gender spectrum that I was dating and attracted to."
Kyle Schwarber is en route to Cleveland on a private jet and will join the Cubs for Game 1 of the World Series as the designated hitter, according to Jon Morosi of FOX Sports
Schwarber played in the Arizona Fall League on Monday, going 1-for-3 with a double to right field. The Cubs sent him to the Mesa Solar Sox recently to get him ready for a potential appearance in the World Series as he nears the end of his recovery from a gruesome knee injury in the first week of the regular season.
The Cubs have yet to confirm Schwarber's presence for the World Series, but manager Joe Maddon spoke of him during media day on Monday.
“He's swinging the bat well,” Maddon said. “He's running really well, actually.
“Right now, he's doing everything well and right. He's given us another option to think about.”
Schwarber can serve as a designated hitter during games at Progressive Field in Cleveland and as a pinch-hitter in games at Wrigley Field. He's not expected to play defense in the field.
Schwarber suffered a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee in early April in an outfield collision with Dexter Fowler. Cubs officials were adamant in the ensuing months that Schwarber wouldn't return this season. Saturday was the first that it was publicly acknowledged he could return before 2017.
President of baseball operations Theo Epstein first brought up the idea of a Schwarber return with owner Tom Ricketts about one-and-a-half weeks ago, Ricketts told the Mully and Hanley Show on Monday morning.
There's no “sentimentality” in including Schwarber on the roster, general manager Jed Hoyer said earlier Monday before a decision had been made.
“If we do put him on the roster, it's because we think he can hit a homer, honestly,” Hoyer said on the Boers and Bernstein Show on 670 The Score.
Back in August, Schwarber left the door open ever so slightly to a return when 670 The Score's Mark Grote asked if there was “any chance” of a comeback in 2016.
“There's no comment on that — most likely probably not,” Schwarber said. “So we're shooting for spring, but I'm going to push myself as hard as I can to come back as soon as I can. It sounds like it's going to be spring.”
Schwarber hit .246 with 16 homers and 43 RBIs in 69 regular-season games as a rookie in 2015. He also hit five homers in the playoffs, a franchise record.
The Cubs face the Indians in Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night in Cleveland. First pitch is at 7:08 p.m., and the hometown call can be heard on 670 The Score.
Pan fried tofu slabs are drizzled with soy sauce and sprinkled with a savory Thai coconut rub spice blend. This flavorful tofu goes deliciously atop a salad, stuffed in a sandwich, or on it's own.
I love food gifts. Whenever a friend goes on vacation and asks what type of souvenir I'd like, they can be sure I'll respond with some type of food. Sauces, spices, dressings…it all works for me. What I especially love though is receiving some seemingly un-vegetarian appropriate food gift and totally reclaiming it for the vegetarian world.
That's what happened when my mom gave me a little spice packet labeled “Coconut Rub” from a local gourmet shop. She knows me and explained that the shop instructed her to use it as a meat seasoning, but of course I'd find some other use for it, which of course I did, whipping up a batch of some mean flavor-packed tofu. I can't say if this recipe stays true to form in the sense of being rubbed with coconut. I've never cooked with meat and I have no clue what this whole rubbing technique is all about, but for purposes of this recipe I'll consider some sprinkling and a bit of distributing the spice with a spoon to be more than sufficient.
I spent a few months working with the rub and eventually perfected my recipe. Eventually though, I ran out of the rub, and rather than seeking out some more, I opted to recreate it on my own. My spice blend recipe below makes between 1 and 2 tablespoons, which would yield you between 1 and 2 batches of tofu. I tried to get the recipes to fit better, but some of the spice amounts are so small that I couldn't get it to work. My suggestion is to try out the recipe as printed below, and then if you like it just make a big batch (triple, quadruple, whatever) of the rub to draw off of next time you make the tofu.
are the tofu hater. Make this. This is the tofu for tofu haters, soon to be ex-tofu haters. It's also super quick, easy and versatile. I could envision this tofu as part of a veggie sandwich, maybe topped with some Thai inspired slaw, but I've mostly eaten it atop salads, usually I told you this tofu is flavor packed, and I meant it. Do you have any tofu haters in your life? Or maybe youthe tofu hater. Make this. This is the tofu for tofu haters, soon to be ex-tofu haters. It's also super quick, easy and versatile. I could envision this tofu as part of a veggie sandwich, maybe topped with some Thai inspired slaw, but I've mostly eaten it atop salads, usually this salad. The salty, savory flavor of the tofu really compliments the sweet tanginess of the peanut dressing and clusters. I could honestly eat just a plate of this tofu as a meal, but I'm open to hearing any creative ideas you try out.
HOUSTON – Texas oil drillers have lost one in three jobs to the furious downturn in energy prices over the past two years, and mass layoffs could continue for months even though oil prices are rising.
The oil-rich state shed another 6,300 petroleum jobs in April, bringing the Texas tally to 99,000 workers as producers continue to reel from a toxic combination of high costs, big debts and low commodity prices. Texas job losses amount to 32 percent of the oil industry's workforce across the state, and it will probably get worse, according to Texas economist Karr Ingham's monthly report on the Texas oil industry.
“There's a six-month window between the change in oil prices and the change in employment,” Ingham said in an interview. “We're still losing big chunks of jobs with each passing month.”
The oil bust, he said, could ultimately shrink the state's oil workforce back down to the size it was during the height of the Great Recession in 2009, if Texas shed a couple thousand jobs over the next few months. Texas had 207,000 upstream workers in April, compared to 185,000 at the lowest point in 2009.
“We're going to cut it very close,” he said.
Rising oil prices won't stop the bleeding. In 2014, drilling activity started to decline months after prices began dropping, and the same will likely be true of the market recovery, Ingham said.
This week, even as crude prices flirted with $50 a barrel, Texas labor regulators said Houston energy service company National Oilwell Varco plans to cut 54 jobs at its facility in Galena Park east of Houston next month. It's just another drop in the sea of pink slips that has engulfed more than 350,000 petroleum workers around the world, according to Houston consultant Graves & Co.
U.S. drillers couldn't generate any cash selling oil at $26 a barrel in February, and they still had to pay off large debts that have forced scores of oil companies like Linn Energy, Energy XXI and Ultra Petroleum to shuffle into bankruptcy court. It has amounted to the worst financial squeeze the industry ever faced, making the major setbacks in 2009 and the early 2000s look easy, according to Rystad Energy, and drillers are still dealing with the aftermath.
The industry has cut $300 billion in spending worldwide since 2014, and in the United States, the number of rigs drilling for oil has dropped from more than 1,600 to 316. EOG Resources believes it'll take $65 oil to reverse the decline in U.S. crude production, which slipped by 6,400 barrels a day in March, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“Before we see an uptick in exploration and production spending, we need to see them repair their balance sheets,” said Robert MacKenzie, an analyst at Iberia Capital Partners in New Orleans. “It's a barrier. They have to be confident that prices are truly rebounding.”
Ingham said his Texas Petro Index, a measure of upstream activity in the state, was 164.5 in April, down from a peak of 313.3 in November 2014. The number of drilling permits issued in April was down by one fifth compared to the same month a year ago.
(CBS) – Some Cook County jail inmates are literally eating parts of the jail, and taxpayers must pay their healthcare and other costs.
CBS 2 Investigator Dave Savini reports.
X-rays show pieces of metal swallowed by Cook County Jail inmates.
“Who would ever think we'd be talking about this?” asks Sheriff Tom Dart, who was more concerned about stabbings, fights and fires when he first took office.
Metal-swallowing inmate Lamont Cathey alone has cost Cook County taxpayers more than $1 million, according to reports.
“Oh my God, the amount of money we have spent — both in the hospital area and then in the staff having to watch these people — I couldn't even calculate it,” Dart says. “I know it's in the millions.”
Cathey are currently in jail. His mother, Lorine Barber, says he has had 19 to 20 surgeries because of all the metal he has ingested, including screws and nails.
“And pieces of whatever falls off the benches, paint, he doesn't [sic] care,” Barber says. “The doctor was like, ‘He's gonna [sic] make it, if he just stops eating (expletive).”
Barber says her son needs psychological help. He is not the only inmate swallowing metal.
Jail records show multiple inmates reported swallowing screws, unidentified metal and buttons. Two reported swallowing the contents of ice packs. One inmate, bleeding from the mouth, said he swallowed a pin. Another inmate put small parts of his wheelchair in his mouth.
“I'm at a loss,” Dart says. “I don't know how to prevent some of this stuff anymore.”
That is because inmates with no access to metal will find something to consume when they are moved for various reasons.
“They're manipulating. They're attempting to get out of this place,” the sheriff says.
Inmates like Cathey often get taken to outside hospitals, such as John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital for X-rays and surgery and other treatment. The outside care requires two guards to be at the hospital at all times and another for transport.
Dart calls it a “very expensive proposition.”
Overall, taxpayers spend about $77 million a year treating Cook County jail inmates. Exactly how is because of the metal-eaters is not known.

Story highlights There were secret orders to be "prepared" to stop a cargo ship loaded with arms
The U.S. and Israel noticed the ship in the Persian Gulf diverted to Iraq to load up
Israel wound up intercepting the ship and its cargo, identified as rockets and missiles
The U.S. Navy had secret orders this week to be "prepared to act" to stop a cargo ship carrying Iranian arms destined for Gaza, CNN has learned.
Navy vessels in the Middle East received orders to move "into the proximity of the ship and act if ordered," according to a senior U.S. military official familiar with the operation.
The scenario included the possibility of boarding the ship, which was eventually stopped in the Red Sea by Israeli naval forces, who authorities said seized a cargo of Iranian rockets and missiles.
A second American official confirmed that U.S. intelligence and the Israelis became aware of the effort by Iran to smuggle the weapons several days ago.
The United States secretly tracked the shipment as it left Iran by air and then landed in Syria. The weapons were then shipped into Iraq and loaded at a port in southern Iraq.

JUST WATCHED Peres: Iran is competing with Egypt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Peres: Iran is competing with Egypt 00:59
U.S. and Israeli intelligence grew concerned when the cargo ship in the Persian Gulf suddenly diverted from its expected heading to Sudan and suddenly turned north toward Iraq to load up.
The United States does not believe the Iraqi government sanctioned the smuggling.
American navy ships in the region secretly tracked the cargo down the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and then to the Red Sea until the Israeli navy boarded the vessel before it reached Sudan, a typical point for unloading smuggled weapons.
The Israeli military later showed video of the weapons with markings indicating they were made in Iran.
The White House hinted at the scope of the operation, but only after it concluded.
"The White House directed the Department of Defense to monitor the vessel and to develop concepts of operation for a range of options to be prepared to take unilateral steps if necessary," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke Thursday with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon to receive what the Pentagon called a "briefing" from the Israelis on the operation.
The Pentagon said in a statement both nations "have been in consistent touch on Israel's interdiction operation, coordinating extensively through military and intelligence channels."
The seizure showed the United States was continuing to hold Iran "accountable for its destabilizing activities in the region, even as we continue efforts to resolve our concerns over Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy," the statement said.
It was the end of the LSU spring game, and Coach Les Miles asked quarterback Jordan Jefferson to break down the team for the last time before they reassemble in August.
LSU Spring Football Game 12 Gallery: LSU Spring Football Game
Jefferson uttered only one word: "Championship!"
Jefferson later said he didn't have any advance plan on what he might say, but clearly the Tigers are not being shy about their goal.
"It's how I feel deep down," the rising senior said. "It's time for LSU to win the national championship game. "It's how we all feel."
Apparently, so do a lot of other folks.
Going into the summer, the Tigers are not a consensus preseason No. 1 (that's Oklahoma), but they're certainly high on just about everybody's lists.
And while some might say that it's better to start the season relatively under the radar -- as did Auburn last season -- LSU is embracing the spotlight.
"It's a great spot to be in," Jefferson said. "It means we're being recognized for the talent we have on this team. We want to be No. 1 when we start. And we plan to be No. 1 when we finish."
Obviously, there's a lot that can happen between now and Jan. 9 when the BCS Championship Game is played at the Superdome.
But The Times-Picayune agrees with Jefferson -- LSU is a worthy No. 1 at the conclusion of spring drills. But note that our post-spring Top 25 is solely on the strength of teams at this stage and does not take into account how strength of schedule and other factors will play into the national championship race. That will be dealt with in another preseason Top 25 in August.
1. LSU (11-2 in 2010)
Since quarterback is the only real question mark about the team and the position appears better with Jefferson back for a third year as a starter and junior college transfer Zach Mettenberger waiting in the wings, there's no reason to believe that the Tigers won't end their season playing for the national championship at the Superdome -- just as they did in 2003 and 2007.
2. Alabama (10-3)
Such is everyone's faith in Nick Saban that the Crimson Tide can lose four first-round draft picks plus its quarterback and still be on the short list of national title contenders. Running back Trent Richardson is the top non-quarterback Heisman Trophy contender and linebacker Dont'a Hightower, safety Mark Barron and cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick could all be first-round draft picks next spring.
3. Oklahoma (12-2)
Finding flaws in the Sooners requires major nitpicking. There's not a better pitch-and-catch combination than quarterback Landry Jones and receiver Ryan Broyles, and sophomore running back Roy Finch will be a more-than-adequate replacement for DeMarco Murray. The team's defensive question marks -- at cornerback and end -- seem to have been resolved in spring practice.
4. Oregon (12-1)
The talented backfield trio of quarterback Darron Thomas and running backs LaMichael James and Kenjon Barner all return. Their ability to carve up opposing defenses will be needed more than ever because the Ducks' defensive losses were severe. However, when you've got the bulk of an offense that averaged 47 points per game back, that may not matter much.
5. Oklahoma State (11-2)
The Cowboys should be in position to earn their first BCS bowl berth -- if not a shot at the title game. Brandon Weeden-to-Justin Blackmon should sound like a broken record by the time the season's over and with the five returning linemen, the offense might even diversify a bit.
6. Arkansas (10-3)
More and more it's looking like quarterback Ryan Mallett's early departure for the NFL was addition by subtraction for the Razorbacks. That theory was reinforced by Tyler Wilson's stellar performance in the spring game. The defense returns eight starters. This ranking might be a little high, but Arkansas shouldn't sneak up on anybody.
7. Florida State (10-4)
The Seminoles keep edging back toward the glory days in their second season under Jimbo Fisher. E.J. Manuel is a better dual-threat quarterback than departed first-round pick Christian Ponder. Linebacker Nigel Bradham and defensive end Markus White head a solid defense.
8. Michigan State (11-2)
OK, the last time we saw the Spartans they were undergoing a 49-7 shellacking from Alabama in the Capital One Bowl. But the one-two punch of running backs Edwin Baker and Le'Veon Bell will be headed for the Rose Bowl -- where they won't have to play Alabama.
9. Stanford (12-1)
Last seen shredding Virginia Tech's defense in the Orange Bowl, Cardinal quarterback Andrew Luck begins the season No. 1 on just about everyone's Heisman Trophy list. That should make the transition from Jim Harbaugh to David Shaw a lot easier. Defensive losses were minimal.
10. Boise State (12-1)
Forgive us for having a bit of Bronco Fever fatigue, but even in making an upgrade into the Mountain West, the Smurf Turfers have the look of another double-digit victory team. Quarterback Kellen Moore, a Heisman Trophy finalist, is back but he'll be throwing to a new set of receivers. Eight defensive starters return.
11. Ohio State (12-1)
Without the suspension of five starters for the first five games plus Coach Jim Tressel for lying to the NCAA about their misdeeds, the Buckeyes would have been in our top five. If the team can overcome the distractions, a seventh straight Big Ten title is not out of the question.
12. Arizona State (6-6)
This could be the last window of opportunity for Dennis Erickson. Arizona State hasn't been to a bowl since 2007, but a ton of experience returns from a team that lost several close games last year, usually a portent for improvement. Losing two starters on the offensive line to knee injuries in the spring doesn't help, though.
13. South Carolina (9-5)
Quarterback Stephen Garcia appears to have finally run out of second chances after his fifth suspension, but the Gamecocks still are the team to beat in the SEC East. That's because running back Marcus Lattimore is back along with wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. A good defense will instantly improve with the arrival of end Jadeveon Clowney, the nation's top recruit.
14. Texas A&M (9-4)
The Aggies arguably were the hottest team in the country at the end of last season until they ran into LSU in the Cotton Bowl. There's even more to like about this team in 2011, starting with quarterback Ryan Tannehill back as the starter and nine defensive starters returning. Look for sophomore running back Cyrus Gray to have a big impact.
15. Mississippi State (9-4)
No, we're not going to put every team in the SEC West in the Top 25 (sorry, Ole Miss) but obviously Dan Mullen saw something in sticking around in Starkville for another season rather than finding more wealth and fewer recruiting obstacles elsewhere. Seven starters return on each side of the ball, led by tailback Vick Ballard.
16. Nebraska (10-4)
Welcome to the Big Ten, Cornhuskers. Or maybe it should be, welcome to Big Red Country. The move of one of the nation's storied programs to a storied conference is one of the most intriguing story lines of the year. The defense has some holes to fill. A return to early 2010 form by quarterback Taylor Martinez is vital.
17. Texas (5-7)
The Longhorns' 2010 fall from BCS runner-up to sitting at home during the postseason was stunning. Mack Brown has shaken up his staff and there's just too much talent in the program for the slip to happen again. Six starters are back on offense and eight on defense. All that's needed is for the team to play with a sense of urgency that was lacking a year ago.
18. Wisconsin (11-2)
The Badgers didn't come out of spring practice looking very strong at quarterback, but then again the running game and defense have been what's kept this program in the top tier of the Big Ten. Tailbacks Montee Bell and James White and a road-grader-sized offensive line should keep the chains moving.
19. West Virginia (10-3)
Junior quarterback Geno Smith has plenty of big weapons, and even though seven defensive starters must be replaced, this is the team to beat in the Big East.
20. Florida (8-5)
There's not a harder team to get a handle on than the Gators. Rookie Coach Will Muschamp has proven himself to be more of a disciplinarian than Urban Meyer and while Charlie Weis certainly flamed out as a head coach at Notre Dame, no one doubts his ability to mold an offense. Still, there were lots of questions coming out of the spring.
21. Texas Christian (13-0)
Too many departed stars from the nation's No. 1 defense plus the loss of quarterback Andy Dalton makes a third straight top-five finish unlikely. But the Horned Frogs should compete for the Mountain West title in their final year in the league before departing for the Big East.
22. Notre Dame (8-5)
Chip Kelly has put together a pair of top 10 recruiting classes and the defense looked outstanding in the spring game. The only question mark is at quarterback.
23. Virginia Tech (11-3)
No preseason Top 25 is complete without the Hokies, although there are more question marks than usual. That's especially true on offense, where running backs Ryan Williams and Darren Evans are gone and the quarterback is ex-tight end Logan Thomas. But Bud Foster's defenses always are solid, not to mention the iconic special teams.
24. Southern Miss (7-7)
No Conference USA team has broken the BCS barrier yet, but with nine starters back on offense headed by quarterback Austin Davis, the Golden Eagles have a shot. The big questions are on defense, a unit that twice gave up more than 40 points last season.
25. Auburn (14-0)
Being the defending champion has to count for something. But this is a far cry from the team that hoisted the BCS trophy in January. Still, there's talent -- starting with tailback Michael Dyer -- and Gene Chizik and his staff know how to get the most out of it.

Jennefa Krupinski has the photo proof to back up her claim: four speed camera photos issued to her since June show her car parked outside of her home in the 3100 block of West Augusta Boulevard, each triggered by a random speeding car — but each costing her $100.

HUMBOLDT PARK — A Chicago speed camera already cited for ticketing parked cars in 2013 has struck again, ticketing one Humboldt Park woman four times without cause.
Jennefa Krupinski has the photo proof to back up her claim: four speed camera photos issued to her since June show her car parked outside of her home in the 3100 block of West Augusta Boulevard, each triggered by a random speeding car — but each costing her $100.
“Aside from the fact that it flashes in my living room, [the speed camera] has given me tickets three times. I'm in a pickle about this,” she said Wednesday, noting that a fourth ticket issued her a warning. “It's clear that my car is parked, but the first two tickets I got, I had to pay.”
That's because Krupinski, an assistant teacher at Suder Montessori Magnet School, was applying for a job within Chicago Public Schools at the time and would have been ineligible for the job if any pending violations were on her record.
She paid the first two at a cost of $200, she said, but the tickets for her parked car kept coming.
Despite putting in calls to the city and her local alderman, it wasn't until DNAinfo Chicago called the Department of Transportation that her tickets were dismissed.
“Human error led to these four citations being sent out," said Michael Claffey, a CDOT spokesman. "All four citations have been dismissed, and we are already in the process of refunding the two tickets that were paid."
The American Traffic Solutions camera remains on site more than a year after it was cited for improperly issuing tickets in a separate incident, according to a Chicago Tribune report from November 2013.
In that report, a spokesman for the private speed camera vendor, Charles Territo, vowed to “make sure it doesn't happen again.”
But American Traffic Solutions did let it happen again. This week, the company declined to comment on the four tickets issued to Krupinski despite wrongly issuing them in August, September and December of 2014.
The city ordered the camera temporarily shut down Wednesday, Claffey said.
“While this issue is isolated to a few instances of human error at this particular camera location, we have made it clear to the vendor that this is completely unacceptable. We expect them to take all steps necessary to ensure this does not happen again. In the short term, we have instructed the vendor to turn off this specific camera and conduct a thorough review of this location,” Claffey said of American Traffic Solutions' handling of the Humboldt Park camera.
According to city officials, the lane in which the violation occurred was not properly verified by human reviewers, as is required by state law, leading to Krupinski's parked car being ticketed for several moving violations.
Since learning of Krupinski's case, the city has reviewed prior appealed cases at her location — of the 100 cases appealed, only 3 were issued in error, officials said.
A thorough review of every citation at the site is underway, and American Traffic Solutions has been ordered to review the placement of the Humboldt Park camera to assess whether the placement played a role in the errors, officials added.
As for Krupinski, the news comes as a relief — but she worries that other law-abiding residents could be ticketed in error.
“Having the camera removed would be spectacular,” she said. “If you're a good citizen and you don't research [the tickets], you could be paying for a ticket that you didn't deserve.”

“Sen. Joe Manchin consistently votes against the core principles and values of the Democratic party's progressive base. In the Trump era, his positions legitimize and normalize Trump. It is time for you to remove him from your leadership team.”
In the face of Donald Trump's fascism, Senate Democrats' job should be clear: stand up for core progressive values, defend the people most threatened by Trump, and block and resist Trump's hateful agenda.
That's why it is unacceptable for a conservative extremist like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to hold a leadership position in the Senate Democratic Caucus. Manchin was the only “Democrat” who voted to confirm extreme racist Jeff Sessions as attorney general and foreclosure king Steve Mnuchin as treasury secretary. Just last week, in a face to face meeting with the White House, Manchin reportedly remained silent while Trump launched a racist tirade against Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In 2015, Manchin voted to defund Planned Parenthood. This is not how a leader of Democrats should act.
There is no justification for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to annoint someone as a member of Democratic leadership who consistently votes with Trump's extreme right-wing priorities, fails to defend our progressive values, and routinely collaborates with Trump by enabling his racist and fascist agenda grounded in xenophobia and hate.1
Manchin should not be helping to lead the Democratic caucus. Can you add your voice to pressure Leader Schumer to act?
Tell Chuck Schumer: Drop Sen. Manchin from your leadership team
Schumer's elevation of Manchin to a leadership role in his caucus legitimizes Manchin's extreme right-wing positions and weakens Democrats' ability to present a united front in opposition to Trump. To be clear, we respect West Virginia voters who have chosen Manchin to be their senator, and we absolutely believe that Sen. Manchin is free to make his own decisions about how to vote. But we reject the idea that Democratic Leader Schumer should have someone in a leadership position who:
voted to confirm friend of Putin Rex Tillerson as secretary of state
promised to vote to confirm climate-denying Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency
attacked former Democratic Leader Harry Reid as "an absolute embarrassment to the Senate as an institution, our Democratic party, and the nation” for criticizing Trump's election 2
has refused to reject a plan to sabotage Sen. Warren's strong Consumer Finance Protection Bureau by replacing its strong director with a gridlocked commission. 3
went on Fox News to call President Obama's climate policies a "war on America" 4
called Democratic support for repeal of the anti-abortion Hyde Amendment “crazy” 5
fought to gut mortgage protections proposed by the Obama administration that would prevent consumers being exploited by unethical Wall Street banks6
Senate Democrats are one of the main firewalls against our fascist president and an extremist Republican party committed to his racist, xenophobic and misogynistic agenda. Leader Schumer has an opportunity to lead his caucus in unprecedented resistance, but he will fail if he chooses the path of compromise. If he keeps Sen. Manchin on his leadership team, he will be sending a clear message that he is more interested in conciliation than opposition. We need to pressure him to do the right thing.
Tell Chuck Schumer: Drop Sen. Manchin from your leadership team.
Thanks for everything you're doing to fight back against Trump.

A section of the embankment of the River Arno in central Florence collapsed on Wednesday morning, sending part of the road and at least 20 parked cars into a newly formed ditch.
The collapse took place very close to the famous Ponte Vecchio, a medieval covered bridge over the Arno.
The hole is about 200m (650ft) in length and 7m (23ft) across.
Firefighters believe the chasm has been created by the failure of a large water pipe beneath the surface.

He appealed to motorists to remove their cars from the nearby area, and said the water supply to part of the city centre was cut off.
Regional paper Corriere Fiorentino reports that thousands of residents are without water.
The first sign of the problem came not long after midnight, when the police were called, the mayor told Italy's Ansa news agency.
The major collapse took place at 06:14 local time, Mr Nardella said.

When Caren Austin and her husband arrived last week at Difficult Campground, they were prepared to enjoy a weekend of outdoor activities. Instead of relaxing around the campfire and taking a few casual hikes, Austin spent most of her four-day vacation worrying about bears.
"Personally, I just didn't have that much fun," Austin said. "I was too paranoid about bear-proofing everything. I felt like I was on edge at all times."
Austin, who lives in Arvada near Denver, never saw a bear, but heard them on several occasions. A bear tried to break into a car less than 30 feet from the Austin campsite, and set the car alarm off five times in one evening. The next day, a large black bear broke into a car in the Difficult day-use parking lot with several people watching. The bear bent a door and broke a window before leaving the lot with a bag of marshmallows in its mouth.
"If we come back to Aspen next summer, I doubt we'll be camping," Austin said. "We'll be in a hotel or staying at a friend's house."
For the past month, there have been multiple bear sightings at the Difficult Campground, as well as several surrounding campsites. Weller Campground is close to Difficult and had to be closed from June 15 through June 22 so the Forest Service could fix and secure the bear-proof dumpsters at the campground.
With the Fourth of July only a week away, most local campgrounds are expected to be full for the holiday weekend. Local authorities are working to inform the public that dealing with bears is serious business and caution has to be taken at every level.

On June 2, a federal regulation was put into effect regarding the White River National Forest, stating that possessing or storing food/refuse anywhere except in bear-resistant containers or inside vehicles in sealed containers is prohibited.
People who don't follow these guidelines will be subject of fines up to $5,000.
The regulation stays in effect through Oct. 15 or until rescinded, whichever occurs first.
Diane and Roy Schoepf are the Difficult Campground hosts. The Schoepfs give every camper a "bear talk," as well as give each campsite literature on dealing with bears in the wild. Diane Schoepf said they believe they've been dealing with the same black bear since May. She also made a point of saying that everyone who sees this bear describes it as very large to huge.
"People need to remember that black bears are smart, wild and very strong," Schoepf said. "The bear we've been seeing pushed over all four of our bear-proof dumpsters on one visit. They're fearless and can do a lot of damage if they want."
Just recently, Roy Schoepf was driving down Highway 82 toward Aspen from Difficult when he saw the familiar bear sauntering down the middle of the highway. Schoepf honked his horn and got the bear to leave the highway, but as he drove away, he saw the bear return to his walk down the middle of the road.
There is a bear trap in operation at the entrance to Difficult. It's been set since Monday — with no success.
Colorado has a "two-strike" policy under which bears may be tranquilized, ear-tagged and relocated once if they are in an inappropriate location or they have engaged in episode(s) of "nuisance" behavior. If that same bear has to be physically dealt with again (tranquilized or trapped due to inappropriate location or nuisance behavior), the bear is put down. Bears that pose a public safety risk will be put down regardless of whether they have ear tags or not.
"It makes me sick to think of a bear having to be put down," said Diane Schoepf. "But they are territorial and get into a habit of returning to where they find food."
Phil Nyland, a wildlife biologist with the Aspen-Sopris Ranger District of the Forest Service, said it's extremely important to educate the public about proper human behavior around bears, both at campgrounds and in the surrounding Aspen area.
Nyland said there have been reports of moderate to very aggressive bear behavior locally since Memorial Day. He said there have been at least four car break-ins in designated camping areas and also said a group of seven campers were charged by a black bear. The bear broke off the charge before reaching the group of campers.
While it's unusual for a bear to be breaking into cars, Nyland and others believe bears learn bad behavior when they frequent areas like Aspen, then return to the wilderness and use their new eating skills in areas like Difficult Campground.
"We're working on informing the public as much as possible about staying safe in the wilderness." Nyland said. "Right now, we're seeing a lot of behaviors we don't want to see in the local bears and need to reduce this recipe for negative encounters."
In the 1980s, genetic and fossil evidence began to call attention to Africa's preeminence in the origins of modern human populations (1), but this evidence could be interpreted in two fundamentally different ways (2). Was Africa's role greater than other continents because it always harbored a larger human population (size) or because modern humans arose in Africa first and subsequently expanded their range across the world (time)? In the 2000s, improvements in DNA sequencing technology and genetic sampling of more present day human groups made it possible to accurately characterize the genetic diversity of groups from different regions of the world, and it became clear that within-group genetic diversity decreased predictably with increased geographic distance from sub-Saharan Africa (3, 4). Subsequently, similar, albeit weaker, relationships were found between within-group variation in aspects of skeletal morphology (cranial, dental, and pelvic measurements) and distance from sub-Saharan Africa (5⇓⇓–8). These results effectively settled the size vs. time debate, because it was hard to imagine how the observed geographic distribution of within-group diversity could have arisen without a recent range expansion of modern humans from Africa. However, how exactly did the spread out of Africa happen? In PNAS, Reyes-Centeno et al. (9) are, to my knowledge, the first to use both morphological data (cranial measurements) and genetic data (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to explicitly evaluate competing models for the expansion of modern humans from Africa. They conclude that after modern humans left Africa, they first went south, only later heading north in a second expansion wave.
The most straightforward option for the peopling of Europe is an expansion wave that passed through the Levant (north along the eastern Mediterranean coast), but there are other possibilities to consider for the peopling of Asia and Australia. Modern humans may have initially migrated along the coasts of the Arabian Peninsula and southern Asia, allowing them to quickly reach Australia, and only later ventured north into Europe and northern Asia. This “southern route” model of two waves of expansion was motivated, in part, by the need to accommodate 60,000-y-old dates for the occupation of Australia (10, 11), but subsequent assessments of the Australian archaeological record (12) have shifted the timing in the minds of most scholars to 45,000 y ago. Intuition suggests that it may have been easier for modern humans to migrate latitudinally along broadly similar coasts (Fig. 1), but in contrast to the northern route for which there is substantial archaeological evidence (13, 14), so far there is little evidence for the southern route.

Often, morphological and genetic datasets are studied with distinct analytical approaches by different research teams, and, after the fact, the insights provided by each are synthesized. Reyes-Centeno et al. take an uncommon and more sophisticated approach; one that should become more widespread in studies of morphology as more and more genomic data become readily available. Using analyses grounded in evolutionary theory (quantitative and population genetics), they are able to handle seemingly dissimilar morphological and genetic evidence within a common quantitative framework. If assumptions are made about the inheritance of cranial characteristics, cranial shape variation can be used to estimate the genetic dissimilarity of pairs of human groups. Together, these dissimilarity estimates combine to form a matrix of pairwise distances. An analogous distance matrix can be generated from patterns of DNA sequence variation. Once these matrices are calculated, they can be related through evolutionary theory to different models for the expansion of modern humans out of Africa, as long as certain assumptions hold, such as that human groups diverged morphologically and genetically by genetic drift (chance changes in gene frequencies) alone. Following the logic of this approach, if modern humans expanded in a single wave, neighboring human groups would always be expected to be quite similar to each other in their morphological and genetic distances, because they arose at about the same time from the same wave. In contrast, if there were two expansion waves, neighboring human groups derived from different waves would be expected to be quite different from each other relative to neighboring groups derived from the same wave, because groups derived from different waves would trace their shared ancestry all of the way back to before modern humans left Africa. Some readers may balk at the suggestion that the morphological distances between human groups were generated by genetic drift rather than natural selection, but multiple studies have demonstrated that patterns of human cranial variation are consistent with this assumption (15, 16). Potentially more problematic is the assumption that present day patterns of morphological and genetic variation primarily reflect ancient expansions from Africa rather than more recent migrations or gene flow.
What are the broader implications of the southern route model? Most intriguingly, it may complicate scenarios for interbreeding between expanding modern humans and Neanderthals (17). If Australasia was colonized by an earlier expansion wave than the one that peopled Eurasia, then why do all non-Africans, including Australian and Papuan individuals (18, 19), appear to preserve evidence of interbreeding with Neanderthals in their genomes? If southern route migrants crossed the Strait of Hormuz (between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman), they would have traveled south of the documented geographic range of Neanderthals in the Zagros Mountains (20, 21), so there may not have been opportunities to interbreed with Neanderthals. Perhaps Neanderthal genetic contributions in present day Australasian individuals were picked up indirectly through a third group that was in direct contact with Neanderthals. Like most stimulating research, the work of Reyes-Centeno et al. inspires new questions and points to fruitful avenues for further investigation.

The NASL is reportedly considering expansion to Orange County and San Diego , the latter of which is also courts an MLS franchise. There may not be enough fans to go around for NASL.
We are part of The Trust Project What is it?
San Diego is stepping up for an MLS franchise, the NASL wants to place teams in Orange County and San Diego, and Los Angeles is on the NWSL's must list.
Southern California, the most verdant land in this United States of Soccer, is the hot ticket for the nation's growing leagues -- or panacea, depending on the league.
There are already two MLS teams in L.A., one of them set to kick off next year, and a USL club in Orange County in addition to LA Galaxy II, plus a whole bunch of PDL, NPSL and WPSL sides scattered here and there. And Club Tijuana offers the chance to watch Liga MX just a 10-minute taxi ride from the border.
The more the merrier, right? Not entirely. The population is massive, with roughly 25 million from Santa Barbara south into Baja, including the country's largest Hispanic population, about 10 million. And there's a long, rich tradition in the sport, thanks to great weather and the collision of so many cultures that so highly value the game.
AYSO was born here. Youth clubs win national titles annually. Some of the nation's most revered talent -- everyone from Ricky Davis to Landon Donovan, Julie Foudy to Alex Morgan -- was bred on its fields. Every U.S. men's national team head coach since Bora Milutinovic has been based here except Bruce Arena in his first stint. You know where Arena calls home these days, right?
This is the epicenter of American soccer, but should it be the destination for every league? Probably not. An NWSL team ought to be here -- this has been ground zero for the women's game for several generations -- and will be, once the right partners are found. Beyond that, though? We'll see.
MLS in San Diego?
Major League Soccer might be a nice fit in San Diego, if it's done right. Local group FS Investors, which plans to apply for an MLS team by the end of the month, on Monday unveiled a plan to build a $200 million, 20,000-30,000-seat multi-use stadium on the site of Qualcomm Stadium, which sits empty following the Chargers' move to L.A. Costs would be shared among private investors and San Diego State University, which would use the facility for its football and soccer teams.
STEVE DAVIS Galaxy sharing with Chargers? Why NFL inside an MLS stadium is great news
San Diego already has a pro soccer team, sort of, in Club Tijuana, which estimates that at least a quarter of its fan base comes from San Diego County and points farther north. But a San Diego Union-Tribune poll found that 70 percent of San Diegans, happy that taxes won't be siphoned off for the project, support the idea of building such a stadium for such a team. The plan proved most popular among youth and Hispanics.
Never mind the two MLS teams to the north. Los Angeles and its environs, stretching from Ventura to Orange County and east into the Inland Empire, can certainly support the Galaxy and Los Angeles FC, which will play a dozen miles apart and should forge one of the league's most intense rivalries.
San Diego is separate from L.A. in most ways, although it makes a dynamite weekend getaway for the neighbors to the north. That's part of why the Chargers' relocation is so curious. There are no sports allegiances tying San Diego to Greater L.A. Chargers fans exist in L.A. -- there are fans of every NFL team in L.A. -- but not a lot of them. Generally, nobody in L.A. cares about the Chargers. There's great satisfaction that the Rams have come home, and had it been the Oakland Raiders to join them, the region would be going nuts.
The presence of the Galaxy and LAFC should have no real impact on a team in San Diego, except that it will intensify competition for the region's best young talent. The bigger concern should be San Diego's status as a sports town. It's no Philadelphia, let's say. If you're winning, you're a big deal, but neither the Chargers nor the Padres -- the only top-flight pro team left in town -- have won much. No big deal: There's a billion things to do in a two-hour radius.
There's also a large soccer community there, and if it gets behind an MLS team, and supports it when things aren't going so smoothly, it could be a great success. The ingredients are there, just bake them up right.
The NASL's gamble
The North American Soccer League lives on despite the raging troubles in New York and Florida and Oklahoma City and the defections to the USL, which now shares Division II status with the NASL. The league has a team in San Francisco this year and needs more West Coast clubs to balance travel and provide a greater footprint, and work to place teams in Orange County and San Diego, as soon as the coming summer, is underway.
If everything were to come together, at some point that would make three MLS teams, an NWSL team, two NASL sides, one USL team and one Liga MX club spanning roughly 135 miles. Its overkill, and if three MLS clubs and an NWSL team make sense -- and they do, mostly -- then the outliers are the NASL teams. SoCal doesn't really do minor-league sports, aside from the Single-A baseball teams in the Inland Empire and High Desert, which have little identity outside their communities.
If MLS were to pass on San Diego, an NASL team might make sense in the market. There are two appropriate venues: 6,000-seat Torero Stadium at the University of San Diego, which was home for the WUSA's San Diego Spirit a decade and a half ago, and 7,275-seat Devore Stadium at Southwestern College in Chula Vista.
Orange County doesn't make so much sense. The Galaxy and LAFC draw from OC (never “the OC,” MTV), and the local USL side -- an LAFC affiliate now going by Orange County Soccer Club -- drew a little over 1,000 per game, with a season-low of 463, at tiny Anteater Stadium on UC Irvine's campus.
The only reasonable venues available for the NASL are 10,000-seat Titan Stadium at Cal State Fullerton, among the country's nicest small soccer facilities, and 9,000-seat Santa Ana Stadium, which has artificial turf marked with football lines and would need a $5 million renovation. Fullerton, smartly, is the aim, and its proximity to the eastern San Gabriel Valley and western Inland Empire is a real plus.
Still, making a splash in the market would be difficult.
Orange County likes to think of itself as separate from Los Angeles, and baseball's Angels and hockey's Ducks have large, committed fan bases and receive ample media coverage, in L.A. as well. An NASL team would certainly find fans -- how many is anyone's guess -- but coverage? Don't count on it.
There are better places to consider if the NASL feels the need to be in Southern California. The Inland Empire, surrounding Riverside and San Bernardino to the east, is home to 4 million people and is growing rapidly, and pro sports is limited to the minor-league baseball teams and an indoor soccer club. An NASL team could do well in the market.
To the north, Fresno and Bakersfield appear to be solid options. Nearly a million people live in and around Fresno, and almost as many in the greater Bakersfield area. Both have substantial Hispanic populations and thriving club soccer cultures. And both have minor-league baseball and hockey teams. Building passionate, focused fan bases would be much simpler there than to the south.
If the NASL is smart, it will look there for a California presence. The I-5 corridor between L.A. and San Diego has enough.

STEVENS POINT — At least two suspected cases of measles are being investigated by health officials in Portage County in what would be the first Wisconsin cases confirmed this year.
The Portage County's Health and Human Services Department said late Thursday that tests were being conducted to determine if the two patients have measles. The individuals involved have been isolated as a precaution with tests underway at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene in Madison.
The health department did not give any information about the ages or genders of the patients or say if they were students at local schools.
The reports came just a day after Stevens Point Journal Media published a report on vaccination rates at local schools.
Nearly 94 percent of students in the Stevens Point Area Public School District have been vaccinated for measles, according to a USA TODAY database of immunization records. Vaccination rates at other schools in the area — even others in Stevens Point — varied to a greater extent. Nearby, at least five schools had vaccination rates of below 90 percent, which is considered the critical mark to hit to ensure "herd immunity" that prevents a virus from spreading rapidly. Stevens Point Christian Academy, a small, private school in Stevens Point, had a vaccination rate of less than 54 percent.
A record number of measles cases were reported nationwide last year, with 644 cases in 27 states, according to the CDC.
As of Feb. 6, at least 121 people from 17 states were reported to have contracted measles this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of those cases are the result of an outbreak that started in December and has been traced to Disneyland in California.

He's Back! Iran's Selfie General Seems To Be in Syria Posing for Pics
Last year, as Iran intensified its role in the fight against the Islamic State, photos of Iranian spymaster Major Gen. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the elite Quds force and arguably Iran's most important international operative, regularly emerged on social media as a consistent reminder of Tehran's contributions in Syria and Iraq.
But in recent months, the silver-haired ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has retreated back to the shadows, putting an end to selfies of him on battlefields shaking hands with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters or standing alongside Yazidi elders displaced from their homes.
That changed this week, when new photos of Suleimani began to circulate on social media. Foreign Policy was unable to determine where exactly the photos — which reportedly feature Suleimani sitting beside members of the Iraqi Shiite militia Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada' (KSS) — were taken. According to a website run by the KSS, the photos were shot near the Sayyida Zeinab shrine in Damascus. But Iran-watcher website “Uskowi on Iran” said other reports indicate they were taken in Aleppo.
A Syrian opposition site, all4syria.info, published additional photos of Suleimani on Tuesday and claim they show him at an Aleppo funeral for one of his officers. At least 29 members of the Iranian military were killed in Syria last month.
If the photos are new, Suleimani's visit coincided with reports Tuesday that Assad's Syrian Arab Army broke an Islamic State siege on Kweires airport in Aleppo, the government's largest success since Russia began airstrikes in Syria in September.
Suleimani visited Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July, and is reportedly helping to coordinate Russian and Iranian operations that are propping up Assad and backing his regime's army.
Moscow's role in the conflict has become a point of contention in the West: Russian airstrikes, which the U.S., France, and other allies hoped would help beat back the Islamic State, have also targeted American-backed opposition forces trying to overthrow Assad.

What to do when adults persist in believing that the burning of
fossil fuels are causing climate change? You know, on account of that
pesky overwhelming scientific evidence and stuff? Simple. Target kids
instead, and try to convince them, as early as possible, that it's all a
crock – or at least that it's highly controversial.
That apparently is the plan of the Heartland Institute, which dubs itself a “free-market think tank” and which has long sought to cast doubt on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Earlier this week, an unknown source forwarded to DeSmogBlog a series of what appeared to be internal documents
from Heartland, including information on funders (including an
anonymous donor who gave the institute $979,000 in 2011, funding much of
the organization's climate change denying efforts, and up to 20 percent of its overall budget), a packet prepared for a board meeting, IRS documents, and a 2012 fundraising plan and budget.

Standing only 2'11" tall, Angelo Rossitto was one of cinema's busiest dwarf actors. Yet he never gave up his Hollywood Boulevard pitch and returned to selling newspapers whenever acting work dried up. Indeed, he became such a familiar figure in Los Angeles that he ran for mayor in 1941, two years after he founded the Little People of America organization. In the silent era, Rossitto teamed with John Barrymore in "The Beloved Rogue" and Lon Chaney in "While the City Sleeps." Yet, despite playing Angeleno in Tod Browning's contentious 1932 horror, "Freaks," Rossitto often went uncredited for roles in such notable features as Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross," Harry Lachman's "Dante's Inferno," and William Dieterle and Max Reinhardt's "A Midsummer Night's Dream." He similarly received no on-screen notice for playing Shirley Temple's stand-in in several mid-1930s outings. Surviving further controversy after playing Angelo in Harry Revier's 1938 underage marriage saga "Child Bride," Rossitto teamed with Bela Lugosi on a trio of B movies between 1941 and 1947: "Spooks Run Wild"; "The Corpse Vanishes"; and "Scared to Death."

Besides reunions with DeMille on "Samson and Delilah" and "The Greatest Show on Earth," Rossitto cropped up (mostly unbilled) over the next three decades in pictures as diverse as "Carousel," "Invasion of the Saucer Men," and "Dracula vs Frankenstein," as well as such 1970s TV shows as "H.R. Pufnstuf," "Lidsville," and "Baretta." He retired in 1986, a year after playing Master while almost blind in "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."
Westpac Research notes:
This is the lowest print of the Index since December last year. The Index is now firmly in the range where pessimists outnumber optimists. In fact the Index has printed below 100 in 15 of the last 17 months.
Having made that overall assessment it is not surprising that we saw a solid fall in the Index in July. We had a taste for households' sensitivity to disturbing news around European instability in December 2011 when the Index tumbled by 8.4% from 103.4 to 94.7. This time the concerns around Greece have been complemented by sensational coverage of the collapse in the Chinese share market.
Back in 2011 the Index recovered by 6.7% once European fears settled down and it is likely that the impact on confidence of the European developments will once again prove to be transitory. However such volatility will not disguise the fact that underlying consumer confidence in Australia remains consistently low.
While markets were volatile there was no net movement in the Australian share market between the June and July survey periods. However the Australian dollar did fall from around USD 0.77 to around USD 0.75
Further evidence that this headline impact from overseas news is unlikely to be sustained can be found in the response of households to the outlook for the unemployment rate. As readers will be aware we have been concerned for some time around the persistently elevated concerns that respondents have for the outlook for the jobs market. The Westpac Melbourne Institute Index of Unemployment Expectations actually fell 1.3% in the month indicating that slightly fewer consumers expect unemployment to rise. Households remain highly concerned about job prospects but the recent overseas developments did not exacerbate those concerns.
However we expect that it is very unlikely that the Board will decide to cut rates in August. In May it was still forecasting above trend growth in 2016 of 3.25% and we expect that the catalyst for any decision to cut rates would come from a substantial downward revision to its growth forecast for 2016 to 'below trend' territory. That decision will be largely influenced by the assessed momentum in the economy in the second half of this year and developments in the labour market. With insufficient available evidence on the former and, for now, the unemployment rate having stabilised there is almost no case for an August move.
Despite current market expectations we would also put a limited chance of a move in November. In fact we are comfortable to retain the view that rates will remain on hold for the remainder of this year and throughout 2016.
Henry Cejudo is somewhat distraught after losing several important personal items and suffering a burn to his foot while escaping the deadly Northern California wildfires. However, it won't stop him from fighting Sergio Pettis at UFC 218.
MMAjunkie today spoke with Cejudo's (11-2 MMA, 5-2 UFC) manager, Ali Abdelaziz of Dominance MMA, and confirmed Cejudo evacuated from the fire and still intends on fighting Pettis (16-2 MMA, 7-2 UFC) at UFC 218, which takes place Dec. 2 at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. The card airs on pay-per-view following prelims on FS1 and UFC Fight Pass.
“He woke up to the fire alarm, but he thought it was just a false alarm so he went back to sleep,” Abdelaziz told MMAjunkie. “He woke up at 4 a.m. to his room being filled with smoke. He had no choice but to jump (from the balcony) on the second floor. He landed on some fire and burned his foot. He's safe.”
Abdelaziz said the damage to Cejudo's foot isn't overly severe. He confirmed there was no broken ankle, as sfchronicle.com first reported, instead described the damage as “scabbing and blisters.” The physical injuries will heal, but the disappointment of losing some significant personal items is likely to last much longer.
Cejudo was in the area to attend Ronnie Lott's celebrity fundraiser at Mayacama Golf Club in Santa Rosa, Calif. Abdelaziz said “The Messenger” was able to escape the hotel room with only his cell phone and was forced to leave behind the gold medal he won in the 2008 Olympic games, other awards from his wrestling career, an iPad, clothing and more.
After going through the experience, Abdelaziz said Cejudo, No. 3 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA flyweight rankings, leaves today for Brazil to begin his training camp for No. 6-ranked Pettis alongside Bellator standouts Patricio and Patricky Freire.
Many consider the UFC 218 fight between Cejudo and Pettis as a title-eliminator in the 125-pound division. Cejudo said following his second-round knockout of Wilson Reis at UFC 215 in September that he's gunning for a rematch with champ Demetrious Johnson, who handed him a first-round TKO loss at UFC 197 in April 2016.
“I'm the one (to defeat Johnson),” Cejudo said. “I know I'm the one. I have the style, I have the wrestling. I know I'm the one to beat Demetrious Johnson. No disrespect to these fighters, no disrespect to any of them. Anybody has that fighter's chance, but I believe I have the style to eventually beat him, and I truly do believe that.”

The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) declared on Tuesday National Police chief hopeful Comr. Gen. Budi Gunawan, whose candidacy has been challenged by antigraft activists, a graft suspect just one day before the House of Representatives holds a confirmation hearing for his nomination.
KPK chairman Abraham Samad said that his office, which began investigating the alleged ill-gotten funds worth Rp 54 billion (US$4.28 million) detected in 2010 by the Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (PPATK) in the bank accounts of the police general in July 2014, had evidence that the money might be related to criminal offenses such as bribes and gratuities.
Budi, who is currently National Police Educational Division chief, has been charged under Article 12 of the 1999 Corruption Law, on bribery and gratuities, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
'Based on our case expose conducted last night, we have strong grounds to charge Comr. Gen. BG with corruption for allegedly receiving bribes or gratuities when serving as former head of the National Police's internal affairs division from 2003 until 2006 and when serving other posts at the National Police,' Abraham told a press conference at KPK headquarters on Tuesday.
Clarifying intensifying rumors that the KPK's move against Budi was politically motivated, KPK deputy chairman Bambang Widjojanto said the KPK's probe into Budi was not a 'sudden' investigation as it all started back in June 2010 when it received reports from NGOs regarding Budi's alleged corruption, which provided a basis for the KPK to launch a preliminary investigation in 2012.
'We held our first case expose into the case in July 2013. Since then we have been collecting evidence on his involvement in the case,' said Bambang.
President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo nominated Budi on Friday as the next police chief to replace incumbent chief Gen. Sutarman, who will retire in October. Budi was a former adjutant to former president Megawati Soekarnoputri, who is also Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) chairwoman.
Budi's nomination had been met with a positive response from lawmakers and prior to the KPK accusing him in the graft case; he was expected to get an easy pass from the House.
Abraham said he was surprised to learn that Jokowi nominated Budi on Friday without consulting the KPK, as the antigraft body, along with the PPATK, had dropped the candidate when he was also tipped for a ministerial post in October.
'The KPK red-flagged him [Budi] during the ministerial candidate screening in October,' Abraham said, adding that the KPK did not announce the graft-prone status of Budi at that time because such a move could hamper its ongoing investigation.
Budi is the first three-star general to be netted in a KPK investigation. The KPK previously sacked two-star general Insp. Gen. Djoko Susilo and Brig. Gen. Didik Purnomo, who is a one-star general, in its investigation into the procurement of driving simulators at the National Police.
After meeting with Abraham on Tuesday night, police chief Sutarman said that the police would respect the KPK's decision. 'As an active member of the police force, he [Budi] will be given legal assistance. Furthermore, we will assist the KPK during its investigation.'
According to Bambang, Sutarman had given his full support to the KPK and had assisted the investigation into Budi's case.
Although Sutarman previously insisted that Budi's funds were clean, he acknowledged that the KPK might have found new evidence that proved otherwise.
In response to the KPK's move, Cabinet Secretary Andi Widjajanto said Jokowi had demanded the National Police Commission (Kompolnas) prepare steps that needed to be taken by the President to address the issue. 'He [Jokowi] was shocked upon learning of the KPK's decision in the case.'
Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited Jokowi's office and spent more than two hours discussing the matter.
Jokowi, according to Andi, will comment on Budi's status and the future decisions that needed to be taken on Wednesday.
Despite Budi's status as a graft suspect, House Commission III overseeing law and legal affairs is sticking with its plan to hold Budi's confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Eight of 10 political factions at the House approved the hearing on Tuesday.
The Democratic Party and the United Development Party (PPP) were the only factions that demanded Budi's hearing be put on hold, while the other eight, including the Gerindra Party, whose lawmakers previously openly criticized Budi's nomination, suggested that the show should go on.
According to Gerindra lawmaker Desmond Junaidi Mahesa, the KPK's decision was 'suspicious' considering the timing.
'We are complying with the majority voice in Commission III. Thus, we will hold the confirmation hearing tomorrow,' Aziz Syamsuddin, a politician from the Golkar Party, said.
The Democratic Party believed Budi's nomination should have been dropped following the KPK's announcement and thus called on President Jokowi to submit the names of other candidates to the House. The PPP suggested that the House first hear the KPK's explanation regarding its decision.
Several lawmakers from the ruling coalition, such as Rio Patrice Capella from the NasDem Party described the KPK's move as 'a slap in the President's face'.
'The KPK should have respected the political process taking place in the House. Why did it make such a decision only a day before the scheduled confirmation hearing.' Patrice said.

Latest Wikileaks Release Shows How US Completely Drove Canadian Copyright Reform Efforts
from the surprise,-surprise dept
If there are any exceptions to TPM or rights management information (RMI) liability, the exceptions should be clearly enumerated and narrow in scope
A system of protections and obligations for ISPs that shelters them from certain liability, reduces and prevents copyright infringement on the Internet and provides incentives for ISPs to work cooperatively with copyright owners.
Embassy Ottawa remains frustrated by the Government of Canada,s continuing failure to introduce - let alone pass - major copyright reform legislation that would, inter alia, implement and ratify the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Internet treaties. Several recent factors compound this frustration, including the fact that:
-- the Prime Minister told the President last August that Canada would pass copyright legislation;
-- the November Speech from the Throne laying out the government,s Parliamentary agenda stated that it would "improve the protection of cultural and intellectual property rights in Canada, including copyright reform;" and
-- senior GOC officials, especially Industry Minister Prentice, repeatedly assured the Ambassador and senior Mission Canada officers that the copyright bill would be introduced "soon." Specifically, assurances were given that the legislation had been finalized and would be introduced prior to the Christmas recess, and then again immediately upon Parliament's return in January. Neither of which occurred.
With Wikileaks State Department cables showing how much the US influenced copyright policy in Sweden and in Spain , it shouldn't really be much of a surprise that the US unduly influenced copyright policy elsewhere as well. The latest Wikileaks report confirms what pretty much everyone knew already: copyright reform in Canada was driven mainly by US interests . Michael Geist points out some of the highlights, including the US Government demanding anti-circumvention provisions (things that the creators of those provisions in the US have even admitted were a failure). Yet, the US demands this, while maintaining that it would prefer there be few, if any, exceptions on circumvention:Separately, the US demanded third party liability on ISPs to pressure them into acting as Hollywood's private copyright police force:In response, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harpher seemed happy to promise such things , which explains why the Canadian government kept pushing so hard for anti-circumvention "digital lock" rules, despite widespread opposition to that key part of the proposed Canadian copyright reform. And yet, the US keeps complaining that Canada isn't ratcheting up its copyright laws fast enough, not recognizing the widespread public opposition that such laws are facing.Note that there is no discussion as toCanada hasn't moved forward. No discussion of the rather effective opposition to overly draconian copyright laws. Just demands that Canada "do something," and plans for the US to keep applying more and more diplomatic pressure.Even more telling, the US ambassadors only seem to speak with either the government or copyright holder organizations in all of this. In one cable , it discusses concerns from the recording industry and the movie studios that Canada's proposed legal changes don't go far enough. Nowhere do they seem to speak toor to anyone who represents consumers. Because, you see, it's not about. In fact, it appears that the "Canadian" Recording Industry Association has a very cozy relationship with the US government, with the two meeting to get feedback on proposals and strategize about policy issues. Again, no mention of any similar consultation with the people actually impacted by such changes in the law: everyone else. In fact, it seems like the only timeis mentioned at all, it's to note how pesky it is that they don't seem to like these changes , and to explain why Canada has slow rolled the changes (because politicians were afraid negative publicity would hurt their re-election campaigns).In one of the earlier documents linked above, the State Department (based on feedback from industry) criticize the idea of "notice and notice" rather than "notice and takedown" with a snarky complaint about how it's "if I told you once, I've.... told you once." Apparently, the officials don't recognize how notice and takedown invariably leads to false takedown and stifling of free speech (something we thought US diplomats were supposed to be protecting).Once again, none of this is even remotely surprising. The US government, at the urging of the US entertainment industry, has been pushing its own brand of overly aggressive, speech stifling, copyright laws around the globe. It's just too bad that Canadian politicians apparently don't have the guts to stand up to bullying US diplomats.

Let me hear your body talk. A new electronic tattoo picks up on subtle noises inside the human body, including the sound of your heart, muscles and gastrointestinal tract.
The skin patch could be used in medical monitoring, to detect irregular heartbeats, for example. It could also act as a human-machine interface to use your voice to control a video games.
“Our body generates a lot of different sounds,” says Howard Liu at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “By designing sensors with a lightweight and thin construction, we are able to capture sounds or vibration signals from our skin.”
Advertisement
The device consists of sensors encased in a flexible silicone shell and flanked on either side by electrodes. It sticks to the skin like a plaster or temporary tattoo and measures just 20 millimetres across. You can stick it on almost any part of the body and it will pick up sounds and vibrations from 0.5 to 550 Hertz – everything from a heartbeat to speech.
The team thinks the patch could be useful for monitoring a broad range of medically significant sounds. In one demonstration, they asked eight people at Camp Lowell Cardiology clinic in Tucson, Arizona, to wear it on their chest. The device detected the patients' heart murmurs and could tell what type they were, an echocardiogram confirmed.
The researchers think the patch could keep tabs on biological implants, alerting doctors to potential medical issues or mechanical failures. As an experiment they introduced blood clots into a heart pump called a left ventricular assistive device, or LVAD. The blood clots changed the sound made by the LVAD, an anomaly the technology should be able to pick up.
Liu says the patch could also enable people to communicate with drones or prosthetics by voice command.
In one experiment, the team placed the device on people's throats and set them up with a voice-controlled game of Pac-Man. The sensors listened to the vibrations of the players' vocal cords, as they said “up”, “down”, “left” or “right” to move the Pac-Man avatar in real time (see video).
As the patch uses vibrations, it can pick out what people are saying even if the sound of their voice is drowned out by background noise, which offers an advantage over other voice control systems.
An algorithm learned to recognise these four basic commands, which the patch was able to capture in quiet and noisy conditions.
“What you're capturing is the vibration directly from your throat,” says Liu. “If you capture signals of this kind directly, you're basically immune from all these surrounding noises.”
“This type of signal – these low-frequency signals that one can get from muscle activities, from the heart, all of that – basically opens a new dimension of information, extra to the one that is typically recorded,” says Reza Bahmanyar at Imperial College London in the UK.
He says the miniaturisation of electronics and the development of biocompatible materials have made such devices possible.
“The way this collection of known technologies is used to produce something that is actually comfortable and usable by a patient – that is what I would call the added value here,” he says.

A dog was found in an abandoned house in Lindenhurst, its matted fur and nails so overgrown that the animal no longer knows how to walk correctly, the Suffolk County SPCA said.
A $2,000 reward is being offered in the case of the Shih Tzu-type dog, which a person said he found July 17 at 131 S. Seventh St., a house he knew was abandoned, SPCA chief Roy Gross said Thursday.
Neighbors told investigators that the prior tenants had moved out almost a year ago, but investigators don't believe the dog was there that long, he said.
It's unclear how long the dog was in the house, but neighbors said they never saw this dog with the prior tenants, Gross said. "Somebody may have dumped the dog in there," he said.
After the pooch was brought to the Babylon Town shelter in West Babylon, it took workers more than three hours to shave 4 pounds of stinky, black fur from the dog, who now weighs 11 pounds and has been named Ziggy, the SPCA said. The dog appears to be 5 or 6 years old, the SPCA said.
"The matting was pulling so much on its legs, it couldn't walk," Gross said. "It was pathetic."
A video shows the dog trying to walk, a mix of paddling on his front legs and some hopping on his back legs.
Chris Elton, director of the Babylon Animal Shelter, said it was the worst case of matting on a dog that he has ever seen, the SPCA release said.

Even after the hair was gone and the long nails clipped, the dog continued walking disjointedly, either because of muscle atrophy or because it had gotten used to walking abnormally, Gross said.
The animal was taken to the New York Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center in Farmingdale, which is providing pro bono care, including extensive physical therapy, so the dog can learn how to walk correctly, the SPCA said.
The agency is offering $1,000 and another $1,000 is being offered by the New York State Humane Association.

Space fans around the world are waiting excitedly for Wednesday of this week, when the ESA's Rosetta spacecraft will attempt a first-ever soft landing of a robotic probe on a comet. The Philae (fee-LAY) lander is scheduled to touch down on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on November 12, 2014 at 10:35 a.m. EST (7:35 a.m PST/15:35 UTC). We on Earth – 300 million miles (500 million km) away – won't know the lander has set down successfully until a signal is received back at about 11:02 a.m. EST (8:02 a.m. PST/16:02 UTC). If all goes as planned, it'll be an awesome achievement, a feat described by Dutch astrophysicist Dr Fred Jansen – Rosetta's mission manager – as trying to:
… do the equivalent of transferring an object from one speeding bullet to another. The comet and Rosetta are flying through space at 60,000km an hour. In many, many aspects this is an absolute first.
The landing site – formerly known simply as Site J – now has an official name. It's been given the name Agilkia, chosen after an ESA public essay competition. The name is in keeping with Rosetta's Egyptian theme. The mission itself was named Rosetta after a stone slab inscribed with a decree issued in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V of Egypt. The decree the key to our modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The name Agilkia, meanwhile, refers to an island on the River Nile. Ancient buildings were relocated there after the island Philae flooded.
After touchdown on November 12, the Philae lander will obtain the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. It will also drill into the surface to study the composition, and witness close-up how the comet changes, as it sweeps closer to the sun day by day. Philae can remain active on the surface for about two-and-a-half days. Its mothership, the Rosetta spacecraft, will remain in orbit around 67P through the comet's perihelion, or closest point to the sun, in July, 2015.
In addition to their well-deserved reputation as beautiful cosmic objects, comets hold vital clues about our solar system's history. They are considered primitive building blocks of the solar system that are literally frozen in time, and they may have played a part in “seeding” Earth with water and, possibly, the basic ingredients for life.
Rosetta launched in March 2004 and spent 957 days in “hibernation” as it zoomed through the darkness of space.
It was “brought back to life” in January 2014 to prepare for its August arrival in orbit around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Since August, Rosetta has been capturing sneak peeks of what lies ahead. Images have revealed stunning structures on the areas of the comet that are visible and illuminated. These features include steep ravines, sharp cliffs and numerous boulders.

Bottom line: Rosetta spacecraft will do the equivalent of transferring an object from one speeding bullet to another, when it tries to place its Philae lander on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Touch down is scheduled for November 12, 2014 at 10:35 a.m. EST (7:35 a.m PST/15:35 UTC). We on Earth – 300,000 million miles (500 million km) away – won't know the lander has set down successfully until a signal is received back at about 11:02 a.m. EST (8:02 a.m. PST/16:02 UTC).

PORTLAND, Ore. -- The Portland Trail Blazers say forward LaMarcus Aldridge has undergone a heart procedure and will miss up to two weeks.
The procedure performed on Friday is a treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a condition which causes the ventricles of the heart to contract prematurely.
Aldridge was diagnosed with the disorder in 2007. He had a similar procedure at the time, and missed the final nine games of the 2006-07 season.
The 6-foot-11 forward from Texas averaged 21.8 points and 8.8 rebounds last season, the best of his five-year NBA career. He had 36 double-doubles.
Questions arose about Aldridge when he did not report for the opening of training camp.
Aldridge later posted to his Twitter account: "Thanks for the support everybody. I'm feeling better and will be ready to go in a few days."
West Ham are preparing a second offer for young Swansea defender Alfie Mawson, despite having their first bid rejected.
According to the Mail, an initial £18million bid for the former England under 21 international was rejected prior to the Christmas break. And according to writer Sami Mokbel, West Ham are set to launch a new £25million, record-breaking offer in order to land their target as soon as possible.

The proposed deal is reported to comprise of £20million up front with a further £5million to follow depending upon appearances.
* In other transfer news, the Hammers are being linked with a move for Hibernian midfielder John McGinn.
The 23-year-old was close to joining Championship side Nottingham Forest last summer but the two clubs failed to agree terms prior to the closure of the transfer window. New Hammers boss David Moyes is reported to be ready to test the water with an offer for the 23-year-old.

* West Ham have been told it will cost them £22million to sign highly-rated Atlanta striker Bryan Cristante.
The 22-year-old has impressed whilst on loan in Italy and is set to complete a 'permamnent' move from Benfica to Atalanta. The later are poised to trigger a £4.5million option to buy Cristante - and make a huge profit by selling him on immediately.

My book on software development metrics is in the final stages of editing. The editor made a kind comment about one section of the book. She wrote: “This section is marvelous. I wish all management everywhere would read this and pay attention.” Me, too. This is the section:
(begin excerpt)
This may be the mother of all management anti-patterns. Management science has treated human beings as interchangeable machine parts at least since the time of Frederick Taylor's “scientific management” in the early 20th century, and possibly much longer than that. Even today, many managers loosely refer to workers as “resources” without realizing the implications of the word.
A resource is an asset whose performance can be calculated and predicted with a high degree of accuracy and precision. For example, as I write this, I'm sitting in a chair. Should the chair break, I can sit in another chair. The new chair will immediately function equally well as the old one did before it broke. The chair requires no training before it can carry out its function. It has no mood swings and never gets tired, sick, or hungry. It doesn't take vacations or need to pick up its ottoman from furniture daycare. The chair doesn't worry about other chairs from the same furniture factory that may be going through a rough patch. The new chair doesn't have a different personal style of chairness than the old chair. It doesn't interact differently with the other chairs in the room than the old chair did. It's easy to calculate the number of chairs necessary to seat 10, 100,
or 1,000 people. The chair is a resource.
When team members leave, you can replace them. But the replacements won't perform at 100% capacity instantaneously. They may have general qualifications similar to those of the former team members, but not identical experience. They will each have a personal style of doing the job. They will get tired, hungry, and sick from time to time. They will take vacations and need to pick up their children from daycare. They will have hopes, fears, professional goals, mood swings, headaches, good days, and bad days. They will worry about family members and friends who may be going through a rough patch. They will have unique personality types and cognitive styles and will create a new dynamic of personal interactions on the team. It isn't straightforward to predict the impact on team performance when a team member is replaced. A team member isn't a resource. A team member is a human being.
When you measure people and predict their performance as if they were resources, it's highly likely that you'll miss important information and cause unintended behavioral side effects.
(end excerpt)
The words we use influence the way we think and act. When managers refer to human beings as “resources,” they tend to treat people like “things.” It happens insidiously. The managers don't consciously think of people as things, but their language guides their actions. This appears to be a very widespread and deeply-ingrained habit in nearly all organizations. When you hear someone in your organization refer to a person as a “resource,” I hope you will mention it to them. Maybe the habit can be changed.
If you find the subject interesting, here are additional rants that may amuse you:
The Herschel space observatory is expected to exhaust its supply of liquid helium coolant in the coming weeks, after spending more than three years studying the cool universe and surpassing the expectations of the international team of scientists involved.
Herschel is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission with important participation from NASA. The telescope was launched on May 14, 2009. With a main mirror 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) across, it is the largest, most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space.
A pioneering mission, Herschel is the first to cover the entire wavelength range from far-infrared to submillimeter, making it possible to study previously invisible cool regions of gas and dust in the cosmos, and providing new insights into the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies.
To make such sensitive far-infrared observations, the detectors of the three science instruments -- two cameras/imaging spectrometers and a very high-resolution spectrometer -- must be cooled to a frigid minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 271 degrees Celsius), close to absolute zero. They sit on top of a tank filled with superfluid liquid helium, inside a giant thermos flask known as a cryostat.
The superfluid helium evaporates over time, gradually emptying the tank and determining Herschel's scientific life. At launch, the cryostat was filled to the brim with more than 606 gallons (2,300 liters) of liquid helium, weighing 739 pounds (335 kilograms), for 3.5 years of operations in space.
Herschel has made extraordinary discoveries across a wide range of topics, from starburst galaxies in the distant universe to newly forming planetary systems orbiting nearby young stars.
However, all good things must come to an end, and engineers believe that almost all of the liquid helium is now gone.
It is not possible to predict the exact day the helium will finally run out, but when it happens, confirmation will come when Herschel begins its next daily three-hour communication period with ground stations on Earth.
The science-observing program was carefully planned to take full advantage of the lifetime of the mission, with all of the highest-priority observations already completed.
"We have known from the beginning of the mission that Herschel's lifetime would be limited by the supply of liquid helium." said Paul Goldsmith, the NASA Herschel Project Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. "So the whole team worked very hard to make the best use of every minute of observing time."
In addition, Herschel is performing numerous other interesting observations specifically chosen to exploit every last drop of helium.
"When observing comes to an end, we expect to have performed over 22,000 hours of science observations, 10 percent more than we had originally planned, so the mission has already exceeded expectations," said Leo Metcalfe, the Herschel Science Operations and Mission Manager at ESA's European Space Astronomy Centre in Madrid, Spain.
"We will finish observing soon, but Herschel data will enable a vast amount of exciting science to be done for many years to come," says Göran Pilbratt, ESA's Herschel Project Scientist at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.
"In fact, the peak of scientific productivity is still ahead of us, and the task now is to make the treasure trove of Herschel data as valuable as possible for now and for the future."
Herschel will continue communicating with its ground stations for some time after the helium is exhausted, allowing a range of technical tests. Finally, in early May, it will be propelled into its long-term stable parking orbit around the sun.
Herschel is a European Space Agency cornerstone mission, with science instruments provided by consortia of European institutes and with important participation by NASA. NASA's Herschel Project Office is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. JPL contributed mission-enabling technology for two of Herschel's three science instruments. The NASA Herschel Science Center, part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, supports the United States astronomical community. Caltech manages JPL for NASA.

Although the new documents would undercut his argument, Gov. Scott Walker has stressed that two judges ruled against prosecutors. Credit: Associated Press
By of the
Madison — A newly released document alleges Gov. Scott Walker's campaign illegally coordinated with two national groups on political advertising in a way that went further than what had been previously known.
The court filing by prosecutors alleges that the governor's campaign crossed a bright legal line by coordinating with independent conservative groups that expressly called for the election of specific candidates in the recall elections for governor and state Senate in 2011 and 2012.
If proved, prosecutors' claims would undercut the argument by conservatives that Walker and his allies did nothing wrong because they coordinated not on these so-called "express advocacy" ads but only on ads dealing with issues in the race. Walker has stressed that two judges have ruled against prosecutors,that he has done nothing wrong and that he is not a target of the probe.
One group highlighted in the filing unsealed Friday is an arm of the Republican Governors Association that has run ads backing Walker since 2010. The other, the Republican State Leadership Committee, ran ads in 2011 against then-Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover), who survived a recall election that year and then retired the next year.
In statements filed with state election officials at the time, both groups said they were independent and not working in conjunction with recall candidates, but special prosecutor Francis Schmitz contended in court documents that the groups had shared information with Walker's campaign.
Prosecutors have been investigating whether the Republican governor's campaign colluded with the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups in the 2011 and 2012 recall elections. The probe was halted in May by a federal judge who said nothing illegal had occurred, in part because no express advocacy was involved.
In hopes of restarting the probe, prosecutors are appealing that decision by U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa in Milwaukee to the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. The latest documents came to light as part of that appeal.
In recently released documents, prosecutors contend Walker encouraged outside groups and individuals to funnel millions of dollars to the Wisconsin Club for Growth. The investigation has centered on Walker's campaign, though an attorney for the special prosecutor has said the governor himself is not a target of the probe.
Walker and the club have said they followed the law, and they argue that any consultation between them was allowed because the club engages only in "issue advocacy." Its ads may praise or criticize candidates, but they don't flatly tell people to vote for or against those candidates.
Prosecutors allege such activities can be illegal if the coordination is done to help a candidate's chances at the polls.
The newly released filing shows Schmitz contends there is evidence Walker's campaign had worked with the Republican State Leadership Committee and the Right Direction Political Action Committee, which is run by the Republican Governors Association.
Unlike the Wisconsin Club for Growth, those groups explicitly back candidates and have acknowledged doing so in filings with the state Government Accountability Board.
R.J. Johnson served as a consultant to both the Wisconsin Club for Growth and Walker's campaign. According to prosecutors, Johnson sought and received campaign strategy from an unnamed representative of the Republican State Leadership Committee.
"Need to know what you are up (to) and the content of your spot. We are drafting radio to complement. Also need to know if you plan to play any further in WI beyond Holperin," Johnson wrote.
The plans were then shared in July 2011 — just before Holperin's recall election — with Walker; Keith Gilkes, Walker's campaign manager; and Kate Doner, a consultant for both Walker's campaign and the Wisconsin Club for Growth, according to prosecutors. The filing did not say whether that information was also given to Holperin's opponent, Kim Simac, or the campaign operation used to elect Republicans to the state Senate.
Other emails show Walker's campaign regularly discussed campaign strategy and polling with the Republican Governors Association, according to Schmitz. The group ran at least eight ads critical of Walker's opponent in the 2012 recall, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.
Walker and the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate in Wisconsin used the same pollster during the recalls, the Tarrance Group in Washington, D.C. The Republican Governors Association also uses Tarrance, though in filings with Wisconsin officials at the time the Right Direction PAC reported spending money on surveys from three different firms.
A spokeswoman for Walker's campaign didn't address the latest allegations specifically but repeated statements from Friday that the governor and his advisers had done nothing wrong. The two conservative groups and Tarrance had no immediate comment Monday beyond a statement by the Republican State Leadership Committee that the group is not a party in the current federal lawsuit against prosecutors.
The document describing the alleged coordination between Walker's campaign and the Republican Governors Association and Republican State Leadership Committee is from a once-secret filing made in February 2014.
Patrick Guarasci, an adviser to the Barrett campaign, said Monday that during the 2012 recall the mayor's campaign did not coordinate with independent groups on polling, fundraising or anything else and did not share their pollster, Fred Yang, or his firm with outside groups.
Documents taken down
Schmitz's filing is from a cache of hundreds of pages of records that were unsealed Friday by a federal appeals court. Within hours, the documents could no longer be accessed on the court's website after some claimed the court had inadvertently made public some of the records that were meant to remain sealed. (The documents are availableon jsonline.com.)
Prosecutors launched their John Doe probe in August 2012 in Milwaukee County and last year expanded it to four other counties. Among the records unsealed Friday were ones naming individuals who prosecutors were looking into as they widened the probe.
Named were Johnson, the consultant to both Walker's campaign and the Wisconsin Club for Growth, who lives in Dodge County; Gilkes, Walker's campaign manager in 2010 and 2012, who lives in Dane County; Eric O'Keefe, a director of the Wisconsin Club for Growth who lives in Iowa County; and Kelly Rindfleisch, a former Walker aide who lives in Columbia County. After an earlier investigation, Rindfleisch was convicted of misconduct in office for doing campaign work while working in Walker's Milwaukee County executive office.
The documents related to the initiation of the latest probe in Milwaukee County do not name a specific person, but say the investigation was expected to review records of Walker's official and campaign office.
This February, the Wisconsin Club for Growth and O'Keefe sued prosecutors in federal court alleging the investigation violated their First Amendment rights of free association. In May, Randa, the federal judge, sided with the group and shut down the investigation.
David Rivkin, the Washington, D.C., lawyer who brought the lawsuit for the club and O'Keefe, said Monday that these latest documents don't show any collusion between Walker's campaign and outside groups.
"The released documents confirm that no crime has been committed," Rivkin said in an email.
Jeremy Levinson, a Milwaukee election lawyer, disagreed, accusing Rivkin of a "not terribly subtle spinning of the facts." Levinson, a Democrat, represented Walker confidant James Villa in the earlier probe of Walker associates.
"What this sets forth is a substantial fusion of the (Walker) campaign and this supposedly independent organization in an institutional and ongoing way," Levinson said of the new filing.
The probe is being overseen by state Reserve Judge Gregory Peterson. He dealt a blow to prosecutors in January 2014 when he quashed subpoenas that had been issued to the Wisconsin Club for Growth and others.
Schmitz soon after asked the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to overturn the ruling quashing the subpoenas, including these latest allegations in his arguments. That filing was made in secret but was later submitted to the federal court and became public with Friday's temporary release of records.
Peterson and Randa — the two judges who have made major rulings on the key issues — concluded nothing illegal had occurred because the groups engaged in issue advocacy and did not tell people how to vote. Schmitz contended that doesn't matter and such coordination can still be illegal if the coordination with Walker's campaign was done with the intention of helping him politically.
"Ads were run on poll tested issues, including fiscal responsibility, tax hikes, wasteful spending and spending priorities that moved independent swing voters to the GOP candidate," Johnson wrote in one email, according to Schmitz.
That the ads were seen as ones helping persuade swing voters shows they were meant to help Republicans, Schmitz wrote.
Over the weekend, two unnamed targets hustled back to federal court to try to stanch the disclosures of more sealed documents. Their attorneys on Saturday asked to halt further deliberate or accidental disclosures in the case. The court should at least halt the disclosures until it considers the unnamed petitioners' reply to a request by media groups to unseal those records, lawyers for the targets argued.
The reply will make clear that the probe's uncharged targets "have a right not to have the details of that investigation made public," reads the filing by Madison attorney Dean Strang and other lawyers in Washington, D.C. and Milwaukee.
Gaming console maker Sony Corp. is betting big on virtual reality, with a new headset and a slew of games sets for release later this year, while rival Microsoft Corp. is also developing its own hardware to make use of the immersive technology.
Shawn Layden, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment America, touted the company's upcoming PlayStation VR in June just prior to the E3 video games trade show in Los Angeles.
The headset is scheduled to hit shelves in Japan for ¥44,980 (about $450) and for $399 in the United States on Oct. 13, along with game titles based on “Star Wars” and “Batman” movies. Square Enix's action role-playing game “Final Fantasy XV” and Capcom's horror game “Resident Evil 7: Biohazard” will also be added later.
Once connected to the PlayStation 4 console, the headset will enable a user to experience a three-dimensional world and interact with that environment during a game.
According to British market research firm Euromonitor, global annual sales of virtual reality gaming consoles amounted to about 2 million units in 2015 and are expected to grow to 25 million units by 2020.
PlayStation VR is likely to lead the way in expanding the virtual reality gaming market, according to game information website VGChartz. PlayStation 4's cumulative sales are 40.75 million units worldwide, far surpassing those of Microsoft Xbox One's 21.11 million units and Nintendo Wii U's 13.14 million units.
Sony Interactive Entertainment is poised to roll out a 4K-capable version of PlayStation 4 that provides a resolution roughly four times as detailed as that of a full high-definition console — a feature well-suited to virtual reality gaming.
Microsoft is also setting its sights on virtual reality, having announced a product tentatively called Project Scorpio, a console with high-fidelity virtual reality that will be available in time for the Christmas 2017 shopping season.
Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, was brimming with confidence about the new product, saying it will be the “most powerful console ever built.”
At E3, Sony Interactive Entertainment set up a hands-on exhibit of PlayStation VR. Facebook-owned Oculus, which had earlier been selling virtual reality consoles, also introduced its software.
“I think VR is really interesting. It's super exciting and fun,” said Munika Lay, a film studio executive who experienced the “Blaze Rush” racing game at the Oculus booth. “I was really able to enjoy playing with and against other people.”
Opinions are divided as to whether virtual reality will develop into a major feature of the gaming industry.
Glen Egan, president and CEO of Sanzaru Games Inc., which provided a sports game for Oculus, predicted virtual reality will establish itself as a gaming mainstay.
On the other hand, Sony Interactive Entertainment President Andrew House said that while pre-order receipts for PlayStation VR were higher than anticipated, it is premature to judge whether virtual reality will enter the mainstream of gaming.
In a similar vein, Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda expressed doubt about how quickly virtual reality would spread, though he believed it could eventually make an impact on the market.
“If virtual reality becomes more popular by, for example, enabling users to enjoy music or sports games as if they were at a live concert hall or at a sports venue, then it will be more popular in gaming, too,” he said.
A key factor that may determine virtual reality gaming's growth will be Nintendo Co., one of the main game console producers along with Sony Entertainment and Microsoft.
Nintendo has traditionally excelled at games easy to play with family members and friends, and has thus distanced itself from virtual reality.
However, the sudden death a year ago of President Satoru Iwata left the company's game development to his successor Tatsumi Kimishima, an erstwhile banker who “could change course and dive into virtual reality” amid poor performance stemming from slack sales of game consoles, an industry source said.
Nintendo plans to put a new game console NX into the market next March in Japan and abroad, but it is unknown yet if it will use virtual reality technology.
Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamHouse to push back at Trump on border Trump pressures GOP senators ahead of emergency declaration vote: 'Be strong and smart' This week: Congress, Trump set for showdown on emergency declaration MORE (R-S.C.) on Friday warned that if Republicans fail to deliver on their promise to reform the tax code, they'lll likely lose their majority in the House.
In an interview with Fox News Radio's Brian Kilmeade, Graham cast a successful vote on tax reform as vital to Republicans' survival in Congress following the failure of efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare.
"Well, I think all of us realize that if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018," he said. "We'll lose the House, probably lose ground in the Senate. And President Trump has got a profile different from the party — there's kinda two or three different Republican Parties now, I guess. But we're all in it together."

Graham also said that, if Democrats take back the House in 2018, they would soon move to impeach the president.
"I can't imagine how he could be successful with Nancy Pelosi running the House," he added. "They'd try to impeach him pretty quick and it would be just one constant investigation after another. So it's important that we pass tax reform in a meaningful way. If we don't, that's probably the end of the Republican Party as we know it."
Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to pass tax reform quickly. GOP lawmakers moved closer to that goal on Thursday, when the House passed a budget resolution that had been cleared by the Senate last week.
That budget will allow the Senate to approve tax reform legislation with just 51 votes, meaning that they will be able to avoid a Democratic filibuster.
According to a Politico report, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Democratic lawmakers at a caucus meeting this week that Republicans would lose their majority in the House if they failed on their tax reform promise.
It's that time again; I suspect that Mavericks will be released in the next few weeks, so I get the once-every-year-(or-so) chance to experiment and modify the hell out of my OS X installation because I'll just do a fresh install soon anyway. This time around I'm experimenting with package managers.
I've actually tried really hard to avoid ever having to use them. I started using Slackware in high school, and after some brief experimentation (in college) with Ubuntu, I took up OS X as my main OS. But, since building from source code is somewhat of a nightmare on a Mac--at least compared to what I was used to--I started to look into package management solutions.
The terrain was difficult to navigate. It seemed like people had some really strong opinions on which one was the best and which ones were on their way out. Since I didn't know who to believe, I just stuck to manual building. But, since I'm going to get a tabula rasa in a few weeks, I thought I'd take this opportunity to document this terrain exploring and present my finding in the most impartial manner that I'm capable of.
Before I start, I want to make a few things clear. (1) There is some disagreement on what actually constitutes a package manager. Here, I'm referring broadly to any centralized software installation framework that tracks or resolves dependencies, whether it builds from source or not. (2) I haven't had the time to become an expert on all of the managers I audited, so keep that in mind. (3) Not only are all of these package managers open source, but many of them have robust configuration options, so I'll be talking mostly about default behavior from the perspective of a new user.
If my old editions of O'Reilly books discussing Mac software are any indication, MacPorts and Fink were the two best options available. Then Homebrew came on the scene and a lot of people seem to be raving about it. I started off with the intention of only trying out these three but in the course of my research, I learned about two others that I wanted to give a chance.
To see a table summary of my findings, you can just scroll down to the end of this post.
Rudix
Rudix is a binary-only package manager that attempts a "hassle-free" way of getting Unix programs on a Mac. It doesn't have many packages available yet, but it has no trouble at all installing and uninstalling the ones that it does offer. For example, their 'Go' installation was the most painless installation of a language that I've ever experienced. My complaints are that (a) the binaries go directly to /usr/bin, so they are not sandboxed, and (b) the man files for these tools were not installed with the binaries.
MacPorts
MacPorts was one of the most recommended package management solutions that I came across in my research. It also probably attracted the most flak. It was built with the likeness of FreeBSD's Ports system, so it's a source building manager. What I liked about MacPorts was the fact that the installation was painless (it updated my PATH for me!), the compiled binaries were sandboxed in /opt/local, and the wealth of packages available was hard not to love.
An interesting thing about MacPorts is that it eschews Apple-supplied libraries and links sources against its own. A benefit of this is that it can ensure a consistent experience across OS X versions and whatever whimsical decisions Apple may choose to make in the future. The drawback to this approach is that building what appears, prima facie, to be a small package may require an extraordinarily large amount of huge programs and libraries to be built as dependencies.
Fink
Fink is modeled after Debian's dpkg and apt-get. Having used Debian-based distros in the past, I was excited to see what Fink had to offer. Like apt-get, Fink can install binaries or build from source. What wasn't like apt-get was that a completely different command was used to build from source ("fink") than to install the binaries. This was somewhat confusing. Furthermore, there is no binary installer for 10.6 to 10.8, so installation was a bit harrowing. Once it was installed, though, and I got used to the separate commands and its differences to "apt-get", I was pleased that my PATH was automatically updated and that the installed binaries were appropriately sandboxed.
Homebrew
Like I mentioned above, a lot of people are really excited about Homebrew. It is being developed with the intention to correct (what it perceived to be) MacPorts' shortcomings. From what I can tell, it tries really hard to work with OS X's existing framework/libraries. For this reason, Homebrew is probably a good choice for someone who is using it to install the occasional tool on a single user system.
A neat thing about Homebrew is that it is written very simply in ruby. Its "recipes" to install packages are easy-to-read ruby scripts. They are also very easy to modify and the community encourages upstream development.
Something not-so-neat about Homebrew is that it is publicly antagonistic towards MacPorts. This is probably something that only I care about, though.
pkgsrc/pkgin
Again, I started with the intention of only auditing Fink, Homebrew and MacPorts. When I learned about pkgsrc, I thought that it was too obscure to be a serious contender and I was considering not looking into it further. I am so glad that, for completeness' sake, I decided to try it out because I virtually have only good things to say about it.
pkgsrc started as NetBSD's package management solution. Given NetBSD's dedication to portability, it is perhaps not a surprise that their package manager would attempt to follow suit. It has now been adapted for use on over a dozen different operating systems. Among these are AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, GNU/Linux, Windows (via Cygwin and Interix) and, of course, OS X. It is the default manager on DragonflyBSD and was even the default manager on a now-discontinued GNU/Linux distro, Bluewall Linux. It is similar to (and, indeed, was forked from) FreeBSD's ports system.
I don't think many Mac power-users know that this is an option for them which is a shame because it turned out to be my favorite. After following some fairly simple steps, a mature and sophisticated package manager with over 8,000 packages is at your disposal.
Probably the best thing about pkgsrc from the perspective of Mac users is a tool called pkgin. It's an apt-like tool for installing binaries from pkgsrc. Installing strange Unix tools on OS X *can not* be easier.
The only caveat I should mention is that I haven't tested installing Python with it because I'm still too far away from Mavericks to risk botching my environment that badly. I suspect that it would cause issues because pkgsrc, being a NetBSD project, can't be as aware of OS X framework idiosyncracies as a Mac-specific package manager can.
I'd like to write more on this topic, but this post is getting unwieldy. I plan to talk more about pkgsrc and OS X in another post but, for this one, I'll conclude with the "too-long-didn't-read" version of my journey through package-manager-land.

Farewell
A Poem
by Anne Brontë
Farewell to thee! but not farewell
To all my fondest thoughts of thee:
Within my heart they still shall dwell;
And they shall cheer and comfort me.
O, beautiful, and full of grace!
If thou hadst never met mine eye,
I had not dreamed a living face
Could fancy charms so far outvie.
If I may ne'er behold again
That form and face so dear to me,
Nor hear thy voice, still would I fain
Preserve, for aye, their memory.
That voice, the magic of whose tone
Can wake an echo in my breast,
Creating feelings that, alone,
Can make my tranced spirit blest.
That laughing eye, whose sunny beam
My memory would not cherish less; --
And oh, that smile! whose joyous gleam
Nor mortal language can express.
Adieu, but let me cherish, still,
The hope with which I cannot part.
Contempt may wound, and coldness chill,
But still it lingers in my heart.
And who can tell but Heaven, at last,
May answer all my thousand prayers,
And bid the future pay the past
With joy for anguish, smiles for tears?
ADDIS ABABA, 3rd July, 2017 (WAM) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Monday that he is ready for a historical peace deal with Israel based on a two-state solution, the WAFA News Agency has reported.
"We are waiting for Israel to respond to the initiative of the US President Donald Trump for a historical peace deal based on a two-state solution," said Abbas addressing the 29th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa.
President Abbas said that Trump's early interest in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict gave hope for peace, stressing that a just solution to the Palestinian cause will be the key to peace, security, and prosperity in the region and the world and will pull the rug from under the feet of terrorist groups that use the Palestinian issue to justify their actions..
The Palestinian President expressed hope that the African Union and its member states will support diplomatic and peaceful Palestinian efforts through international bodies to help implement the two-state solution.
According to WAFA, Abbas reiterated his readiness to strengthen relations and cooperation in economics and trade with the African Union, and exchange expertise in agriculture, health and clean energy, in addition to cooperation in the field of security, and combating terrorism through the Palestinian Agency for International Cooperation.
He thanked the African Union and its members for their support of the rights of the Palestinian people and their just cause in international bodies and forums.
Norwood Park Dominick's in Limbo View Full Caption
NORWOOD PARK — The fate of the Norwood Park Dominick's store is in limbo, with less than a month until it is scheduled to close.
While Mariano's Fresh Markets announced plans this week to buy 11 Dominick's stores throughout the Chicago area, the store at 6312 N. Nagle Ave. wasn't on the list — leaving local leaders, employees and shoppers wondering what will become of it.
"I hope it just doesn't sit vacant," Joe Kubica said while on his way into the store to stock up on his favorite honey wafers before the store closes. "I hope it keeps going."
Kubica said he has been shopping at the Dominick's near Nagle, Devon and Milwaukee avenues off and on for 15 to 20 years.
"It is a real shame," Kubica said, noting that thousands of cars must drive by the strip mall that includes a bank, a drugstore and a nail salon every day — including many undoubtedly on their way to famed hot dog joint Superdawg across the street.
Jason Hernandez, senior advisor to Ald. Mary O'Connor (41st), said she is working with the city's economic development department to identify a good tenant for the store, which also includes a Starbucks cafe.
Bea McDonough, the executive director of the Norwood Park Chamber of Commerce, said she hadn't heard anything about the store's future.
Dominick's is expected to shutter 68 area stores, including its 15 city locations, by the end of December.
Earlier this year, Jewel-Osco bought two Dominick's stores, in Lincoln Park and in the South Loop, and Mariano's plans to buy stores in Edgewater, McKinley Park and West Town. Two other Mariano's stores will open in Ukrainian Village and Bucktown.
Whole Foods is also interested in seven Dominick's stores, but not the Norwood Park location, according to a report in Crain's Chicago Business.
Whole Foods just opened a new store in Park Ridge, which is not far from Norwood Park.
Carlos Burgos, who works as a customer service representative at the Norwood Park Dominick's, said he and the rest of the store's employees had hoped to know their fate by now.
"We're just waiting," Burgos said, adding that he fields questions from dozens of anxious shoppers every day. "We've heard that someone bought us, but we don't know who."
Burgos said he and his co-workers are relieved they will have jobs at least through the holiday season.
"Everyone is worried," Burgos said.
On Wednesday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office announced it is forming a task force to help find new tenants for any Dominick's stores that aren't bought by the end of the year.
Eleanor Toman, who said she has been shopping at the store since it opened in the 1980s, said she would miss its wide selection of cat food.
"I wish it would stay just the way it is," Toman said. "It is a nice store in a nice spot."
But if it does close without a new tenant, Toman isn't worried that her cat will go hungry.
"Most of the time now I go to the Marino's on Elston [Avenue] near Foster [Avenue] anyway," Toman said. "Everything changes."
There is much to criticize about Washington's failed policies toward Cuba and the embargo it has imposed on the island for decades. But the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which in the last fiscal year enabled 1,278 Cubans to defect while on overseas assignments, a record number, is particularly hard to justify.
It is incongruous for the United States to value the contributions of Cuban doctors who are sent by their government to assist in international crises like the 2010 Haiti earthquake while working to subvert that government by making defection so easy.
American immigration policy should give priority to the world's neediest refugees and persecuted people. It should not be used to exacerbate the brain drain of an adversarial nation at a time when improved relations between the two countries are a worthwhile, realistic goal.
XCOM is the signature game when it comes to turn-based combat on a grid. And 2K's Firaxis Games just announced a new expansion, XCOM 2: War of the Chosen.
But imagine the surprise of the Firaxis developers when they learned that Ubisoft was launching Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle as a turn-based combat game on a grid, only in a funny Mario-like universe. We asked Firaxis' Jake Solomon, the creative director on XCOM 2: War of the Chosen, about what he thought about Mario coming to his kind of game.

“There are few times in my career that I've been as surprised as when I was watching that presentation,” Solomon said in our interview. “Just like everyone else, my jaw dropped a little bit when I heard the phrase, ‘As you see, Luigi has taken half-cover.' What world am I in right now? I couldn't believe it.”
He added, “But I realized that this is finally how I can introduce XCOM to my daughters. I can finally play something like XCOM with my daughters, introduce the basic concepts. Then, when they're old enough, maybe we can move on to XCOM together. That was really cool to see.”

I also asked him if that meant that cover and flanking strategy from military games will become a mainstream part of gaming.
“It's neat to see these things become standards of gameplay. It's good,” Solomon said. “Hopefully, they'll come up with something awesome. I liked the jumping mechanic. They'll come up with some cool twists, and I'll definitely steal them. [Laughs] I never thought I'd see Mario taking cover with a gun.”
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- John Elway's signing of Peyton Manning moved the Denver Broncos into Super Bowl contention for the past three seasons.
But it could be the Denver defense that carves the team's path back to the Super Bowl this season. To see this defense up close is to be surprised by the speed, like a televised horse race in which the tape speed is one-and-a-half times reality. It's pretty clear the Broncos' defense is under the radar. With Wade Phillips in charge as the defensive coordinator, the group is primed for improvement, and potentially the better unit on this team.
As I watched last Tuesday's practice, linebackers were shooting through the blocking scheme so fast that they reached Manning twice before he was able to get the ball out. On another play, the pressure was instant, and Manning scrambled to his right and tossed the ball away to avoid the sack. Of course, a "sack" in camp is merely an obvious case of a defender being there before the ball would come out. But because you can't hit the red jersey, defenders can slow up, and make the offense look better than it is. In this case, the speed with which Denver defenders could be near Manning was striking.
Speed. That's the buzzword for the Broncos' defense. DeMarcus Ware, Von Miller and Shane Ray fire through and into gaps with speed. The inside linebacking corps has range and speed.
"You just think about the guys in general -- me, Von, Shane, Derek Wolfe and others," Ware said. "We have guys who are very athletic. We don't have the typical 3-4 guys who are doing two-gap. We are more of a pass-rush, dynamic 3-4. I am amazed how guys are hustling and getting to the quarterback."
In the preseason opener, the Broncos sacked Seattle Seahawks quarterbacks seven times and forced Pete Carroll to make two changes along the line to fix the problems created by the Broncos. In two preseason games, the Broncos have a total of 12 sacks.
Because of the star power of the Broncos' offense, the defense often gets overlooked. Under John Fox, who used a hybrid 4-3 scheme that dabbled a little with the 3-4, the Broncos finished third last year for fewest yards allowed and had 41 sacks.
Phillips thinks they can get better.

"The sky is the limit for us," Ware said. "We are trying to be the best defense in the NFL. That is testament to what Wade brings to the game and how he plays guys. We have those types of guys who run and get to the quarterback. We shoot gaps. And the linebackers are fast and quick."
Ware is probably the biggest benefactor of the Phillips hire. Ware had 60.5 sacks in the four seasons Phillips was with him in Dallas. At 33 and in incredible shape, Ware might be ready to return into the 16-to-20 sack level for at least another season with Phillips calling the defensive plays.
"It's a comfort level," Ware said. "Those were some of my top years playing in Wade's defense. You can see it with Von now. He's 100 percent healthy. Wade knows how to stunt guys and when to drop them in coverages. For offenses, you don't know who is coming."
Miller should be a candidate for defensive player of the year in this scheme. He has 49.0 sacks in his first 56 games in the league. He looks natural in Phillips' 3-4 pass-rush scheme. Miller is a unique talent. Ware compares him to Derrick Thomas, the former Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame pass-rusher.
"Von comes off with so much speed and tenacity trying to get to the quarterback," Ware said. "He has so many different types of rushes. He can spin. He can duck underneath blockers. He's a short box guy, but he just has so much power. He can get his body so low. That's what the coaches always like. He can get around the corner and still keep his stability."
Don't underestimate Ware's ability either. He has 127 career sacks and has eight trips to the Pro Bowl. Those qualifications alone make him a candidate for the Pro Football Hall of Fame down the road. The Ware-Miller pass-rush tandem ranks among the best in football. And don't forget rookie Shane Ray. Considered one the top pass-rushers in the NFL draft, he fell to the Broncos and could allow more of a rotation, keeping Miller and Ware fresh.
Phillips is arguably the best coach in football when it comes to taking a base 4-3 defense and converting it to the 3-4. Transitions in San Diego and Houston dot his NFL résumé. He laughs off the idea that it's a complex transition, saying the only difference in the schemes is whether one defender plays with a hand on the ground or not.
Some 3-4 schemes force defenders to handle two gaps. Phillips stresses the one-gap approach and players love shooting those gaps in trying to get to the quarterback.
"When players in Wade's system come to the games, it's not like it's, 'OK, I got to butt this tackle or butt this guard or I've got to play the A-gap and the B-gap,'" Ware said. "You know you are playing one gap and there are 10 other guys who have their own gap responsibility. Bill Kollar [the defensive line coach] came in here and said we aren't two-gapping anymore, we aren't going to be sitting ducks. We are a pass-rush 3-4 team.'"
The Manning-led offense might have more questions than it has had since he arrived, but it will benefit from not playing the Denver defense.

Q: Do you see a team deep at the WR position trading with a team that desperately needs WRs like Carolina?
Alex in Bellevue, Washington
QUESTIONS, PLEASE Do you have a query for John Clayton?
Click here to send a note to his mailbag.
A: It's possible but unlikely. Ron Rivera probably will use more two-tight-end sets with Greg Olsen and Ed Dickson. Rookie Devin Funchess will need to step up and give Cam Newton the big target he will miss with the season-ending knee injury to Kelvin Benjamin. The other three options for Newton are Corey Brown, Ted Ginn Jr. and Jerricho Cotchery. Replacing Benjamin won't be easy but it's also pretty clear a trade wouldn't fully replace a No. 1 receiver.
Q: I don't see a good reason why the Chargers and Raiders would have to change divisions if they both move to L.A.
Michael in Council Bluffs, Iowa
A: The situation would be similar to the New York Giants and New York Jets, who share a stadium. New York is the No. 1 market. Fox and CBS wouldn't allow one conference or one network to have two teams in the No. 1 market. Los Angeles is the No. 2 market. It would be unfair to Fox, which has the NFC schedule, to let CBS have the Raiders and the Chargers.
Q: The Cowboys seem to have an "opportunity" to go with a running back by committee. My question is whether that ever really happens for a good running team. It's like the bullpen that has a closer by committee -- they're just saying they don't have a closer they like. Am I right?
Darren in Trenton, New Jersey
A: It's hard to find more than eight to 10 elite running backs who can dominate a game. Because of that, more teams are using the committee approach at running back. But the Cowboys clearly are gambling that their offensive line is good enough for their run game to work without DeMarco Murray. Even as a tandem, I still wonder if Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden can stay healthy for a grueling 16-game schedule. Teams that don't have that every-down back have to use the committee approach. We'll see how the Cowboys did with this gamble.
Q: Did Tyrod Taylor's performance against the Browns make you think he's the guy to beat for that job? Sure felt that way to me.
Dave in Rochester, New York
A: I still think Matt Cassel is going to win the job. Last week was an important one for Taylor because he had the No. 1 snaps in practice and in the preseason game against Cleveland. He did some good things. His mobility and athletic abilities could help the Bills' ground-and-pound approach to the offense. For the Bills to get to 10 or 11 wins, they need a quarterback who isn't going to turn over the football. Because Cassel has the experience, he's still the leading candidate for the job. EJ Manuel still looks the odd man out in Buffalo.
Q: Is Kam Chancellor going to miss a regular-season game?
Sarah in Spokane, Washington
A: No. Something will happen to get him back with the roster at some time. I don't think he wants to miss regular-season game checks, and the Seahawks can't afford to go into the opening games in St. Louis and Green Bay without him. This is a tough situation for general manager John Schneider. If he gives more money to Chancellor, he could have a half-dozen Seahawks holding out for more money next year. Pete Carroll, meanwhile, has to worry about winning the first two games. They need Chancellor in camp.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin has signed a law ratifying a deal with the Syrian government allowing Russia to keep its air base in Syria for almost half a century, official documents show.
The original deal, signed in Damascus in January, sets out the terms under which Russia can use its Hmeymim air base in Latakia Province which it has used to carry out air strikes against forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
Putin approved the agreement on Wednesday, after the two chambers of the Russian parliament backed it earlier this month, according to the government's official information portal.
The document says Russian forces will be deployed at the Hmeymim base for 49 years with the option of extending that arrangement for 25-year periods.
The base has been at the heart of Moscow's military foray since it intervened in the conflict in September 2015, helping turn the tide in favor of Assad, one of Russia's closest Middle East allies.

A Song of Ice and Fire creator George R.R. Martin recently visited Los Angeles to meet with HBO and other studios. According to his Not a Blog, those meetings may lead to big things in the future:
When I wasn't gazing out over the city from the balcony of my room at the Four Seasons, I was having meetings. HBO meetings, for the most part… exciting stuff, and they all went well… and meetings with some major film studios as well, about possible adaptions of some of my other work. All very exciting. Cross your fingers, cross your toes, I might have thrilling news down the line.
HBO is currently developing five Game of Thrones prequels, and Martin is involved to some extent with all of them. Perhaps one or more of them are going forward?
The execs may also have been talking about Who Fears Death, an upcoming HBO series set in a post-apocalyptic future which Martin is producing. Or both.

It's harder to guess what Martin talked to “major film studios” about. Martin has an extensive collection of work beyond A Song of Ice and Fire, with Syfy already adapting his 1980 novella Nightflyers for the small screen. Martin isn't involved in that show; his development deal with HBO prevents him working on TV shows for other networks. But that deal might not forbid him from working on movies…
Martin also found time to reunion with the cast and crew from Beauty and the Beast, including star Ron Perlman. The drama ran on CBS for three seasons starting in 1987. Martin served as a staff writer. “It was an honor to work on BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and I'm proud of the work we did there,” he wrote.

Researchers at the EFF have apparently confirmed that certain color printers put hidden marks in the pages they print, and they have decoded the marks for at least one printer model.
The marks from Xerox DocuColor printers are encoded in an array of very small yellow dots that appear all over the page. The dots encode the date and time when the page was printed, along with what appears to be a serial number for the printer. You can spot the dots with blue light and a 10X magnifier, and you can then decode the dots to get the date, time, and serial number.
Many other printers appear to do something similar; the EFF has a list.
The privacy implications are obvious. It's now possible to tell when a document was printed, and when two documents were printed on the same printer. It's also possible, given a document and a printer, to tell whether the document was printed on that printer.
Apparently, this was done at direction of the U.S. government.
The U.S. Secret Service admitted that the tracking information is part of a deal struck with selected color laser printer manufacturers, ostensibly to identify counterfeiters. However, the nature of the private information encoded in each document was not previously known. … Xerox previously admitted that it provided these tracking dots to the government, but indicated that only the Secret Service had the ability to read the code.
The assertion that only the Secret Service can read the code is false. The code is quite straightforward. For example, there is one byte for (the last two digits of) the year, one byte for the month, one byte for the day, one byte for the hour, and one byte for the minute.
Now that the code is known, it should be possible to forge the marks. For example, I could cook up an array of little yellow dots that encode any date, time, and serial number I like. Then I could add the dots to any image I like, and print out the image-plus-dots on a printer that doesn't make the marks. The resulting printout would have genuine-looking marks that contain whatever information I chose.
This could have been prevented by using cryptography, to make marks that can only be decoded by the Secret Service, and that don't allow anyone but the secret service to detect whether two documents came from the same printer. This would have added some complexity to the scheme, but that seems like a good tradeoff in a system that was supposed to stay secret for a while.
Mohammad Albederee at the Manus Island detention centre. They raise fresh questions over the human rights implications of Australia's tough border protection regime, which has been condemned by the United Nations, and will fuel calls for children to be immediately released from detention. The data shows that in the year to July 2015 there were 188 incidents of self-harm involving asylum seekers at Nauru, about one every two days. There were 55 such self-harm acts at Papua New Guinea's Manus Island. They included detainees swallowing poisons, stuffing tea bags down their throats and hanging by bed sheets or other makeshift nooses. In one incident on Manus Island a detainee "inflicted 12 lacerations to his stomach with a razor blade". In another, a man "swallowed a Christian cross pulled from his wallet".
Scars on the torso of Mohammad Albederee, who has been cutting himself with a razor. Another man was found attempting to damage his wrist "with a small ring of metal" and was restrained. He tried to break free, saying, "I want to die, let me die." At Nauru in October 2014 a detainee, apparently upset after meeting his lawyer, "wrapped himself in toilet paper and attempted to get hold of a lighter". In another incident, a woman "poured boiling water over [her] lower limbs". Mohammad Albederee has been cutting himself with a razor. Also at Nauru, a man "was seen to jump from a top bunk with [a] torn sheet around his neck", while, separately, a detainee who swallowed anti-dandruff shampoo "was on the floor of the tent vomiting and ... appeared to be unconscious".
In May last year a man had "sewn a heart shape design into his hand using [a] needle and thread". The rate of self-harm is even higher in Australia's onshore detention network, where there were 706 acts in 12 months - almost two incidents a day. They included asylum seekers living in the community or in community detention. At Villawood in June a detainee drank half a litre of disinfectant and took heart medication. Other detainees have swallowed washing powder, shampoo, stones, insect repellent, detergent, toilet cleaner and head lice treatment. An asylum seeker living in the community in Western Australia last July "took 250 tablets of different medications" in an attempt to commit suicide.
Others have tried to injure themselves by bashing their heads against walls, mirrors, wardrobes and steel poles, or by choking themselves with plastic bags or scarves. A handful of log entries appear to be wrongly categorised or updates on previous incidents. But the figures are likely to be conservative because many acts of self-harm or violence appear to be included in other incident categories. The freedom of information requests, made by the University of Melbourne's Law Students for Refugees in conjunction with Fairfax Media, did not include logs of threatened self-harm, minor assaults or voluntary starvation. The documents suggest the rate of self-harm at Nauru - once every two days - is significantly higher than that reported to a Senate inquiry last year by Transfield Services, since renamed Broadspectrum. ​The controversial company, which performs key functions at the offshore camps, reported 253 incidents of self-harm over 972 days between September 2012 and April 2015, or about one incident every four days.
As Fairfax Media revealed this week, the time asylum seekers spend in onshore detention has increased under the Turnbull government to a record high of 445 days, raising concern over the effect on detainees' mental health. An Immigration Department spokesman said all incidents of self-harm, no matter how significant, were reported and "any detainee who threatens to self-harm, or self-harms, receives immediate and appropriate medical care and support". He said the department supported the governments of Nauru and PNG through contractors who worked with detainees in welfare, health and medical roles. Detainees who threaten or commit self-harm "are immediately provided with both counselling and medical services". "The services provided in both Nauru and Papua New Guinea are broadly comparable with health services available within the Australian community," he said. A Broadspectrum spokesman said the company "stands behind its track record" at the offshore detention centres, where it has made "significant improvements".
Anguish at heart of detention regime Plum-coloured scars criss-cross the torso of Mohammad Albederee, an Iraqi who cuts himself with a standard-issue razor and fears "I will die soon". Mr Albederee once reportedly cut open his stomach during a hunger strike to prove it was empty. Now advocates say the Manus Island asylum seeker wants to eat, but can't keep anything down. He claims he was injured by guards during an altercation and now suffers constant shoulder and kidney pain. "I can't do anything. I'm staying nine months in pain and … I don't see anyone care about me," he said in a video recording obtained by Fairfax Media.
"I feel very, very tired all the time. Pain my chest, pain my stomach, pain my kidney, pain my legs. Sometimes I can't move my leg; sometimes I can't leave my bed. "I'm … very, very, very scared because I feel I will die soon." In November prominent human rights lawyer Julian Burnside, QC, attempted to intervene in Mr Albederee's case, saying the asylum seeker was at risk of death and must be brought to Australia for treatment. Authorities said he was receiving appropriate care and his life was not endangered. South Australian refugee advocate Jeanie Walker, who is in daily contact with Mr Albederee, said: "All he wants is surgery on his shoulder and kidneys, so he's out of pain. "There's nothing of him. He's just skin, bone and scars. He's jaundiced, his liver's not working.
"His mental state is all over the place … now he sometimes hears voices and those voices are telling him to cut himself." A spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said it had "strongly refuted" numerous claims advocates made about Mr Albederee. Mr Albederee was "consenting to and receiving appropriate medical support and treatment", at Manus Island, the spokesman said, adding he had received hospital treatment at Port Moresby in November and December and had been medically cleared to return to Manus.

Watch: Shia LaBeouf Says He's Willing to Go All the Way for Lars von Trier (VIDEO)
Shia LaBeouf, the actor who made his name with the “Transformers” movies, has declared that he's cut ties with the big-budget studio system. So just how serious is he about becoming an art house name? It turns out, very.
While promoting his upcoming release “Lawless” alongside co-star Jessica Chastaine, the star told MTV that he's willing to do anything Lars von Trier asks of him for the Danish auteur's next project, “Nymphomaniac,” which will reportedly be shot in softcore and hardcore versions.

“There's a disclaimer at the top of the script that basically says, we're doing [the sex] for real,” LaBeouf says in the video interview. “And anything that is ‘illegal' will be shot in blurred images, but other than that, everything is happening.”
Charlotte Gainsbourg, Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgård round out the cast for the sure-to-be-controversial project that follows “the erotic life of a woman from the age of zero to the age of 50.”

The Valdosta Police Department responded to an alert one March 15 at 1:15 a.m. off Baytree Drive near the Gates apartments after gunshots were fired in a large crowed of people.
According to Adam Floyd of the Valdosta Daily Times, police are now looking for the person who supposedly started shooting in the crowd of people.
The police had originally arrived to check on the large group of people gathering outside one of the resident's apartments, when suddenly gunshots were fired.
“People started running away from the area as the gunshots went off,” said VPD Capt. Bobbi McGraw, in a VDT article posted on March 17. “Witnesses reported some type of disagreement went on prior to police arrival.”
The article also reported that a 25-year-old man was shot in the leg during the incident, was treated at South Georgia Medical Center, and was eventually released.
Senior Chris Dunn was attending the party that hosted about 150-200 people when an altercation broke out.
According to Dunn, he had nothing to do with this altercation; however, ended up getting shot in the leg by someone in the crowd.
“The bullet went in one side of my leg and out the other,” said Dunn.
Out of the large crowd that attended the party, Dunn was the only one who received a bullet wound that night.
Dunn was taken into the hospital shortly after the shooting, and was released before noon on Sunday morning.
According to a WCTV article written by Winnie, McGraw also reported that there are no suspects in custody and no evidence for motive. VPD is looking in to whether it was an intentional shooting or if the shots were fired into the air and ricocheted off something.
“I'm not currently working with the police, but I'm not not cooperating with them,” said Dunn.
After the shooting occurred on Sunday morning, the VSU Police Department did not issue a campus alert to VSU students, faculty, and staff, according to WCTV, even though the incident happened near the University's main campus that houses many students living off-campus.
WCTV also reported Chief Oswell Armour says because the shooting happened “5/10 of a mile away from the University”, and he “just didn't feel like the alert was necessary.” Armour further adds that when the reports of the shooting came to VSUPD, the situation was basically over.
Valdosta Police are still currently looking for a suspect for the shooting, but has not yet been successful.
Brooks's and artist Canaan White's graphic novel The Harlem Hellfighters documents the suffering and courage of African-American troops in the Army's legendary 369th Infantry Regiment of Harlem, N.Y.—from the vicious, degrading treatment they received in training to the horrors they faced in the trenches of WWI.
Max Brooks is best known as the author of the bestselling Zombie Survival Guide and the graphic novel, Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks.
You've done comics before, but why do this project as a graphic novel?
What I love about comics is that they're a great way to tell a visual story without having to worry about the economics of Hollywood.
How did this graphic novel come together?
Random House asked if I had another project I wanted to do, and I said I'd love to turn this script I have into a graphic novel. Initially this was a movie script that I started in the late '90s at the time TNT had done The Tuskegee Airmen, the original Tuskegee airmen film with Cuba Gooding and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. So I wrote a script, took a couple years, did the research, and brought it in. TNT said no. Everybody else said no. I was about to shove it in a drawer. I had one last meeting that changed everything for me—with Lavar Burton. He said, don't give up on this. He said there are a lot of Harlem Hellfighter scripts making the rounds in Hollywood now, but yours comes closest to the truth. That was the best compliment I could have ever gotten.
You've done a lot of work in the horror genre and there are scenes of WWI combat in Harlem Hellfighters that perhaps is best depicted using comics.
I think this is the scariest thing I've ever written. That's why I'd rather go up against Zombies than fight in the trenches of World War I. Everything in the book is all real. I didn't make anything up. I wanted to be able to defend the graphic violence, and it's not gratuitous. The scene of the flesh being blown off the bones is from a book I read [on the period]. That's what happens when a shell lands. The rats, the mustard gas, the picking of lice, that's all real, it didn't come from me.
It's hard to believe this story hasn't already been made into a movie.
When men and women go off to war, one of the things that keeps them sane knows that they've got their whole country behind them. So to have to risk their lives in the trenches, not only knowing that the country doesn't have their backs but that it is actively trying to sabotage them... When you add all the pieces up, it's scary mosaic. It's why I wanted to write this. Look at their combat record: 191 days in combat, longer than any other American unit; first American unit to reach the Rhine; never lost a trench; never lost a man to capture; whole unit wins the Croix de guerre. If this had been a white unit, there would have been a movie made about them in the 1940s.
A great point in the narrative: Black troops in the 369th could see clearly that every racist-driven obstacle imaginable, both from the larger society and the US military command, was erected to prevent them from being effective soldiers.
It's never been proven but that's what I believe, I think it's true it was an active conspiracy. When you add all the pieces up it offers a scary mosaic of sabotage. There's Spartanberg, S. C. where black troops were sent to train. Why would you send a unit to train in the deep south when there's just been race riots there? Uniforms, training, weapons [were substandard]. Black soldiers had to scavenge for weapons and pretend they were white rifle clubs in order to get up-to-date weaponry. When I read it I said, you gotta be kidding me.
That's where I had to go back to my research because I thought I had made a mistake. I did about four feet of research [gesturing with his hands to note the stack's height] when you stack it up. When you do a comic book, I think it's harder than a movie script or a novel. When you write a novel, if you need a uniform button, you don't have to describe it, it's not important. And if you do a movie script, that's the art department's problem. When you do a comic book, you have to see everything. Canaan, the artist, and I were meticulous. 50% of the book is just weapons, what does World War I look like.
Tell us about the book's characters.
Some were based on real world characters and some were made up. I wanted my main character to be fictional because I didn't want to run the risk of offending anyone's family. I wanted to have artistic freedom, so my immediate squad of men is all fictional, so I could be free to write. Henry Johnson was very real, the first American black or white to win the Crois de guerre. I wanted to be able to meld artistic freedom with real characters, like James Reese Europe, a real guy, [a pioneering creator of ragtime and jazz and a lieutenant in the Hellfighters and director of the regimental band, which played for troops all over Europe]. From what I've read about him he was driven and brilliant and a guy you would admire, but from afar. You don't want all your characters to be nice and wonderful. Jim Europe was a perfectionist and nothing upset him more than when his band didn't reach his expectations.
What about the ending? The story of the 369th is both a great tragedy and a great triumph.
I struggled with the ending. I realized I wanted to say that this was just the beginning of the fight [against racism] as opposed to the end. As a character in the book says, “I'd like to say we changed the world, but the truth is we came home to the Red summer of 1919, the worst racial violence this country has ever seen.” The 369th moved the ball forward, but they took one step in a very long road. I know that's not an ending that Americans like. They did have that one triumphant moment [the parade they got on returning]. I wanted to focus on the parade because that was something they were denied and they got their parade. For that moment, everybody came out and that was great.

It appears that Disney and Lucasfilm's plans for the Indiana Jones franchise go far beyond one more movie. While Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull kind of proved that this was a franchise better left alone, we learned in March that director Steven Spielberg and star Harrison Ford are indeed reuniting for Indiana Jones 5, with the film set for release in July 2019. Now, given the fact that Ford will be 77 years old by the time this movie is released, one might reasonably assume this is his last go-around with the character—after all, a guy can only lead an action-adventure franchise for so long, even if you are Harrison Ford.
However, given that Lucasfilm owns the Indiana Jones franchise and that Disney owns Lucasfilm, one might also reasonably assume that the Mouse House has bigger plans in store for such a lucrative IP. Just last month, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that Indiana Jones 5 is only just the beginning:
“Right now, we're focused on a reboot, or a continuum and then a reboot of some sort…We'll bring [Ford] back, then we have to figure out what comes next. That's what I mean. It's not really a reboot, it's a boot — a reboot. I don't know.”
If Iger was a bit confused on the terminology here, the folks running the story department at Lucasfilm are decidedly not. Earlier today at Star Wars Celebration Europe, a panel was held called “The Art of Storytelling”, which shone a light on the Lucasfilm Story Group, which serves to spearhead the overarching storytelling of the entire Star Wars franchise, keeping the canon straight for the films, TV series, comic books, etc. But Lucasfilm isn't just Star Wars, and during the panel—for which Collider's own Perri Nemiroff was in attendance—ILM President Lynwen Brennan made a curious note with regards to the Indiana Jones movies when speaking about the Story Group's work on the Star Wars franchise:
“Kiri [Hart] and her group have mapped out a story and timeline across multiple platforms many years in advance, many exhausting years in advance. … We have a great honor to have responsibility for, so we want to be really careful with that. Not only for Star Wars but with Indiana Jones, which we're all really excited about as well.”
Brennan seems to suggest here that the Story Group—which comes up with and runs the story development for the Star Wars “episodes” and standalone films and how they all fit together—is also coming up with long-term story plans for Indiana Jones. Does this mean we're getting an interconnected Indiana Jones movie universe a la Star Wars, with proper sequels and then standalone films set within the Indy universe? Or does this simply mean they're getting a head start on connecting the franchise across various platforms, from movies to video games to TV spinoffs?
At this point, we don't know for sure, and given that the script for Indiana Jones 5 isn't even written yet, things could certainly change. But it's definitely curious—and promising—to know that the very talented Lucasfilm Story Group is serving as caretaker of the Indiana Jones universe, and it's not hard to image Spielberg's longtime producer Kathleen Kennedy (now President of Lucasfilm) coming to the filmmaker with the prospect of him directing one final Indiana Jones movie to kick off a new franchise.
My guess? The Story Group is running with whatever plans Spielberg has for Indiana Jones 5 and also brainstorming potential ways to extend the franchise without rebooting it entirely and forsaking all that came before. Whether that means sequels like Indiana Jones and the Return of Mutt or prequels that delve deeper into Jones' backstory remains to be seen, but one thing's for certain: the Indiana Jones franchise is far from complete.
Just amazing – a real Christmas Miracle! This is another RIP Saab case – “That you believe, is it miracles or best of safety”.
Yesterday morning, on the local road in Slovakia – Saab 9-3 Sportcombi written off, but family with two kids walked away after “black ice” on the Bridge. Saab falls 30 feet off bridge into frigid river Hrone Diver of Saab 9-3 had lost control on black ice and collided with the side of the bridge.
Saab falls 30 feet from bridge, lands on its roof in, fortunately, a shallow river Hron. Police officers said the man tried to overcorrect it due to Black Ice and went over the rail of the bridge. There was a 43-year-old Saab driver and his two children – an 11-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son.
It can be said that this accident ended with a miracle in the Christmas – driver and passengers thankfully were not hurt after a car accident!
The SAAB is a sturdy, safety-designed car. Proof of its sturdiness can be obtained from any SAAB owner and some evidence of its safety design features can be found in a multitude of different examples.

Upon first reading reports of an “anti-science” and “muzzling” bill, you could easily get the impression that “mum's the word” for any further discussion on science/health topics like GMOs, vaccines, climate change, raw milk etc. One recent report accidentally left out a crucial word that changes the entire meaning of Virginia House Bill 207, sponsored by Richard P. “Dickie” Bell (R-Staunton).
When reading the bill, it appears to lift a muzzle and encourage more analysis – why is that making people so angry? It's receiving all kinds of backlash from local media, teachers and educational organizations. The flak focuses on what they view as a move to push creationism into schools.
Turns out, the real fear is, “fringe” beliefs seeping into the classroom.
Here is the section in question:
C. Neither the Board nor any local school board, division superintendent, or school board employee shall prohibit any public elementary or secondary school teacher from helping students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories covered in science classes.
Furthermore, neither to “to promote nor discriminate against any religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote or discriminate against a particular set of religious beliefs or nonbeliefs, or promote or discriminate against religion or nonreligion.”
Not exactly a call to take the classroom to the Creation Museum … But as ridiculous as that sounds, opponents are fearing that other teachers will undermine “real” science by openly teaching “fringe” beliefs like “climate change denying” or anti-evolution, and no one can stop them from teaching their “bad” science.
Glenn Branch, Deputy Director of the National Center for Science Education, said
“The rhetoric of these bills is speciously attractive, appealing to values of open inquiry and the like,” he added. “In fact, though, they would in effect permit science teachers with idiosyncratic opinions to teach anything they pleased — proponents of creationism and climate change denial are the usual intended beneficiaries of such bills — and prevent responsible educational authorities from intervening.”

But the local paper goes on to say:
“Therefore, teachers enamored of “crank” theories like creationism, climate change denial, geocentrism, flat-earthism, vaccine denial, homeopathy, perpetual motion, or others could teach them in class “confident that their administrators couldn't interfere,” Branch said.
Not sure how prevalent that is in the public school system, but isn't this what homeschool parents get accused of? Sheltering their kids from other belief systems…
A complaint read elsewhere about possible disruption in the classroom should probably read more like a throwback to No Child Left Behind – “But where is the time allotted for such discussion? I barely get enough time to teach the materials as it is.” The biggest complaint I ever heard from teachers is “I just wanted to teach. It's all about the state tests now and my job is on the line if they fail…” And this was from teachers who just wanted to delve deeper or do more Bill Nye experiments – not teach that vaccines are the devil's fingers or Darwin is burning in hell … But opponents worry that they've been given no guidance on how to deal with these questions (should there even be time for them) – not exactly a good defense, though, for what they call already excellent science standards in critical thinking.
A legitimate fear would be a hijacking of lecture time when there is so much pressure for passing test scores. But it's not forcing them to teach a non-mainstream curriculum. Oh, that's not leaving. It's not even forcing them to answer a “controversial” question. The intent appears to be lifting a (possible) barrier, protecting them in the event they answer a controversial question and mention two opposing theories. And what of tolerance, eh? The irony is, opponents are calling this bill a way to politicize education.
The thing that the conflicting groups are losing sight of is – who is caught in the middle of both of these politically motivated moves? Children and teens who just showed up to learn and don't realize they are not hearing the full range of information. Until they get into the real world and realize they have one line of thinking but few tools to even argue for it. And this bill won't alter that – it's a systemic issue. On that note, why would highly educate teachers feel so threatened by a potential opportunity (not a mandate) to analyze strengths and weaknesses of any theory? Especially if the theories are so accepted. Isn't that the whole idea of developing a hypothesis? Has not scientific thought been wrong before? Who gets the authority to label thought as “crazy,” “bad,” “crank,” “fringe,” or the like?
Dam-surfing daredevils' viral video sparks warning from Tweed Shire Council
Updated
Thrillseekers sliding down a concrete spillway at a northern New South Wales dam are risking their lives in front of audiences of millions.
Videos of young people on the giant "illegal waterslide" at the Tweed's Clarrie Hall Dam have been viewed up to seven million times.
One video shared this week has attracted more than three million views and includes subtitles that insinuate the people featured have been given permission to slide.
However, the Tweed Shire Council's manager of water, Anthony Burnham, said the council would never give permission because of the serious risks involved with a flip-bucket at the bottom of the chute.
"It's got a large flip bucket at the end which is an energy dissipating device and with any significant flow you can be held underwater in that flip bucket and drowned, obviously on the way down you can be rendered unconscious and drown," Mr Burnham said.
Mr Burnham said the council was considering its options to stop the practice, which has been exacerbated by social media.
"We've tried to have these things removed from social media channels with limited success, things like CCTV monitoring and the like have also been vandalised so it's been very hard for us to try and keep people away," he said.
Mr Burnham said an extreme measure could be closing the Clarrie Hall Dam to the public.
"Council might have to consider it as an option to close the dam to the public altogether," Mr Burnham said.
Daredevils turn to YouTube
Managing director of Safe on Social Media Kirra Pendergast said the appeal of risk-taking behaviour for adolescents was often increased by the potential audiences reached through platforms like YouTube.
"There is a massive upsurge in it, every second child in every primary school I speak in wants to start their own YouTube channel and the more dramatic the content the more views they're going to get," she said.
"It gives them their instant fame hit, the riskier the behaviour the more fame they get, it's like a drug."
She said the monetisation of social media content was also attractive to young people.
"There's a massive financial incentive because once you hit 10,000 views on YouTube they start to place ads around your videos so it can be quite a good earner," she said.
"If a video had roughly 3.5 million views a year, they would make roughly between $8,000 and $10,000."

Marvelous has put out a new batch of Luminous Arc Infinity details, introducing three of the game's 12 heroines, as well as some of the game's combat systems.
Get the information below.
Characters
Rana (voiced by Ayaka Ohashi)
A good looking who's not very attentive of her surroundings. Fearful of any creature that approaches her once they get large enough, she can look like she'd practically collapse from sheer nerves if left alone in their presence. She's strangely not very good at expressing her feelings. She thinks about and feels a lot of things, but is not able to put it into words, so she's often misunderstood. She also often speaks in questions, sometimes posing philosophical questions to herself.
Hisoka (voiced by Ayane Sakura)
A talkative and often-laughing girl. She likes setting traps, as well as puns. She's the type you can immediately get along with, but won't open her heart in the truest sense. More than anything, she likes to read. But not newspapers, as she's bad with anything else printed that aren't her books, meaning the contents go in one end and out the other immediately. She is always tolerant, and can withstand hunger, not breathing, cold weather, and such for long periods.
Kasumi (voiced by Aya Uchida)
A calm and graceful woman who displays an air of refined, noble elegance. She's sociable, with an undying smile planted on her face. If angered, she retains her smile as she draws her sword, her speech taking a turn for the scary. Though at her core she's fundamentally a reliable, level-headed person, she has her more air-headed moments as well. A fan of fortune-telling, she travels around the world intended to solve curse-related mysteries and is as such informed in such matters to an extent. Easily brought to tears, she handles the subject of romance so poorly that she can easily lose her cool. She's very positive and almost never negative. One day, she hopes to be an archaeologist.
Duo Rent
The heroines of Luminous Arc Infinity have special moves called “Arts” that take advantage of each attribute. By triggering “Duo Rent” with one of them, you can borrow their Arts to attack. This system will also increase the favorability between the two characters that make use of it.
Duo Strike
Ranking above the Duo Rent is the “Duo Strike,” a technique that combines the Arts of the two characters that use it. When using the Duo Strike, the attribute of your combined Arts change depending on the weakness of the enemy, making it an extremely powerful special move.

Tens of thousands of Canberrans were misled by original maps published by NBN Co showing broadband construction had started when in fact it had not, the company's chief operating officer says.
A parliamentary hearing involving NBN Co on Monday finished with a loud verbal sparring match between the ACT's two senators and revealed in glaring detail how the hopes of territory residents have been dashed.

NBN Co chief operating officer Greg Adcock said the company's rollout maps during the era of the federal Labor government did not use the mainstream definition of the word "construction".
"The maps put up there on the NBN Co website ... were put up there when very very preliminary design had been contemplated but the label given was 'construction commenced'," Mr Adcock said.
Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Turkish citizens arrived en masse in Istanbul on Sunday, after marching 250 miles over three-and-a-half weeks to demand the government loosen its stranglehold on the country's democracy.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), finished the last kilometer of his long trek alone and was met with huge applause and chants of "Rights! Law! Justice!" as he entered Maltepe Square.
The square was packed to its seams and many attendees and marchers gave up trying to enter the rally, instead joining in on the chants from grassy patches outside the square.
"We need justice and democracy. That's why we have been in the roads for days," said Fadime Özbudak, a 47-year-old housewife. "It's wonderful here. I couldn't even get inside, but I'm just so happy. ... I've never seen anything like this in Turkey."
Another housewife, Yasemin Safak, a member of Kilicdaroglu's CHP, said she was impressed that so many people, who could have elected to do a variety of other things over the weekend, chose instead to be heard at Sunday's rally.
The rally was so packed, some protesters had to sit outside Maltepe Square.
"I'm here for justice, rights and rule of law. I believe everyone needs justice. Some of the wrong policies need to end. Everyone knows what they are. We want a livable Turkey. The poor get poorer while the rich get richer," she said. "The people say no to these injustices. This is the voice, the scream of the people for justice."
It's not clear exactly how many people Kilicdaroglu addressed in and around the square, but the crowd was enormous. While some estimates pegged the tally at more than a million people, that number could not be immediately confirmed.
Modest beginning
The "March for Justice" has mushroomed from a one-man protest led by Kilicdaroglu. He soon was joined by throngs of disaffected citizens -- many angry with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan -- as Kilicdaroglu kept his promise to walk from the capital, Ankara, to Istanbul after the imprisonment of one of his party's parliament members.
Thousands of supporters cheer and wave flags while waiting for the start of the "Justice Rally."
Huge demonstrations unfolded in Maltepe, a district in suburban Istanbul that is home to the prison where Enis Berberoğlu is being held. They waved Turkish flags and banners bearing the word, "adalet," or "justice," and held up portraits of Turkey's founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Berberoğlu was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in jail for giving an opposition journalist video allegedly showing Turkey sending weapons into Syria.
Thousands of supporters hold a one-kilometer stream of Turkish flags in Sakarya on July 1 during the march.
"Turkey has stopped being a democratic country. It has become beholden to one man," Kilicdaroglu told CNN. "This we cannot accept."
Still reeling from coup attempt
The rally comes almost a year after a failed military coup radically changed the country's direction . Following the coup attempt, Erdoğan and his government have clamped down on civil liberties across the country, gutted public institutions and universities, heavily restricted the media and ordered mass arrests of activists, journalists and the political opposition.
The country has remained in a state of emergency for almost a year now, giving the Erdogan-led government extraordinary powers to detain anyone it sees as oppositional.

Among the marchers was 62-year-old Refika Ozturk, a retired municipality worker who walked for 10 days. She sat on a grassy patch in Istanbul, exhausted, her shoes off. She and her friends wore T-shirts that read "adalet."
"I'm marching for my rights, the law and justice. You can do something as hard as walking as this for so long when you believe in it, when it's for a cause," she said Saturday.

What will come of rally?
Despite the fatigue, the final leg to Istanbul was festive, with bands playing along the way.
Turkish protesters have regularly clashed with security forces over the past year, but the march has been peaceful, with police securing the protest from outside threats.
It's unclear whether that harmony will continue in Istanbul, a city at the heart of Turkish liberalism, where rallies are now banned in historic Taksim Square.
A protester waves a Turkish flag with the nation's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, superimposed on it.
At least one protester who spoke to CNN wondered if the government would hear protesters' demands, forget the rally or dub the demonstrators terrorists once the flags were gone and the chants had died down.
The long walk to Istanbul was difficult for many. Two people suffered cardiac arrests, one of whom later died, while others found the heat unbearable and rushed for water and shade at every opportunity. On other days, torrential rain was the enemy.
No shortage of Erdoğan backers
The protest is a sign that Turkey remains divided. While the march was cheered by onlookers, Erdoğan's supporters also turned out to watch the protests, chanting his name in response to the marchers' chants of "Rights, law, justice."
Turkey's main opposition party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu began the march three weeks ago.
Supporters of the protest drove by and made the peace, or victory, sign. But Erdoğan supporters flashed the four-finger Rabia sign, originally used in support of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood but since adopted by Erdoğan's fans.
The division has persisted for some time. In April, Erdoğan was granted sweeping powers after narrowly winning a referendum that transferred powers from parliament to the executive branch of government. The presidency in Turkey is traditionally ceremonial, but Erdoğan has acted as the nation's leader and its head of government. International monitors slammed the referendum for being conducted on an uneven playing field.
Kilicdaroglu has tried to brand his protest as beyond politics. His supporters have displayed no political logos, and he has called for Turks of all political affiliations to join.
If and when the zombie apocalypse is nigh, we will all have to make one monumental decision: Where to seek refuge?
Steer clear of the 25 cities on the map below, produced by real-estate website Trulia. Unless you're a zombie, in which case, live it up! (Oh wait, you can't.)
When the undead rise up, hitting the beach in zombie-free bliss will not be an option. Honolulu is ranked as the most appetizing city for hungry zombies.
Residents of Honolulu will make easy targets for the walking dead, what with the city's high walkability and lack of hardware stores (where there are potential zombie-killing weapons). Honolulu also has a high hospital density, making it easy for zombies to find weak victims, and it is extremely congested, with some of the worst traffic in the nation.
New York is number two on the list, followed by Newark, Boston, and Washington D.C.
Trulia calculated the survivability of the cities using the following criteria: highest walk score, the lowest hardware store density, the highest hospital density, and most congestion.
Dries Deryckere talked about the solution, which helped him to create amazing procedurally destructible car system. It's hard to imagine what students' can do with modern technology these days. Dries Deryckere most recently published an amazing project (which you can actually get for free or for a couple of bucks at Gumroad), which features a fully procedurally destructible car. It's all achieved through an intricate setup of blueprints. We've talked with Dries about this system and he shared how he managed to create it and what problems he had along the way.
Introduction
My name is Dries Deryckere and I'm a student at Digital Art and Entertainment (DAE). DAE is a course provided by the Howest College in Kortijk, Belgium. I'm currently doing an internship in Valencia. I've freelanced a bit left and right, including for beffio.com. I've never worked on a big title or project, as I'm still a student and I'm still finding my way in the industry.
Building Procedurally Destructible Car
The project itself is actually my graduation work for DAE. I researched different ways on how to do procedural deformation and finally settled with a system I put in place myself. The system works as following:
UE4 has a skeletal mesh system which allows the user to import rigged objects using fbx files. These objects can be given physics and can be simulated like a ragdoll. What I've done is I've taken a skeletal mesh and I've given it very high damping. This renders the rigged object inanimate, except when another physics object collides with it with a certain speed and mass (and thus force).
Problem is that the skinned object does not fall to the ground and has no other physics than the deformation. So I looked for a way to make it simulate in a local space. I achieved this by taking the same mesh, unskinned, and setting it as a simple static mesh. I give this static mesh physics like a normal static mesh, so it falls to the ground and behaves like you would just set “simulate physics” to true.
And then, using blueprints I teleport the skeletal mesh construct to the simulated static mesh. And then I only render the skeletal mesh. Both the the skeletal and the static mesh have collision boxes for the other physicsobjects that collide with the deformable plate, but collision is disabled between the static mesh and the skeletalmesh.
So to make a long story short: Skeletalmesh with high damping -> teleport to -> simulated staticmesh.
All the elements of the car (including the parts that hinge and can deform) are held in place with physics constraints.
Current problems with the project:
Cars can't collide with each other (fixable but will take some work).
Deformation is a bit unpredictable and objects need to be heavy to have real impact. (fixeable but would require to change all the paramaters)
Some missing elements on the car.
Very performance heavy with 6+ cars on scene.
Not user friendly and creating a different car would require making the system again from scratch, because everything depends on the mesh. There is no way to create a “generate” button.
All elements in this project are textured using substance painter. The wrinkle effect in the normals is done with a dynamic material that blends in a normal when a hit is registered.
Each bendable material is unwrapped in a way that the main wrinkle texture used for all materials makes sense.Same for the paint that gets destroyed.
Dynamic materials are not really hard to pull of in UE4. Some quick reading in the UE4 documentation tells everything.
Be sure to download the project and try it out on your own. It's a great way to learn how to do some more incredible stuff in UE4. Be careful though, the download is almost 1 gigabyte.

AUTHOR John Spurling has won a £25,000 literary prize with a "mesmerising" book that was rejected 44 times before being published.
He was awarded the sixth Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction for his novel set in imperial China, The Ten A Thousand Things.
The book is set in 14th-century China, during the final years of the Mongol-ruled Yuan Dynasty, and is the story of Wang Meng, one of the era's four great masters of painting.
Mr Spurling's fourth novel, it took him 15 years to write and was rejected 44 times before being published by Duckworth last year.
The English author was at the Brewin Dolphin Borders Book Festival in Melrose, Scotland, where he was presented with the prize by the Duke of Buccleuch this evening.
The judges said: "The Ten A Thousand Things is subtle and rewarding. Through John Spurling's writing you feel as though you are reading Wang Meng's paintings as he created them.
"It is a mesmerising, elegantly drawn picture of old imperial China, which feels remarkably modern."
The other writers shortlisted for the prize were Martin Amis, Helen Dunmore, Hermione Eyre, Adam Foulds, Damon Galgut and Kamila Shamsie.
Extracts from each of the seven shortlisted books were read by broadcaster James Naughtie at the awards ceremony.
Speaking after he was shortlisted, Mr Spurling said: "Absolutely delighted to be shortlisted, especially because I'm a great admirer of Walter Scott, have read all his fiction and have a small bust of him on my bookcase.
"I don't see myself as specifically an historical novelist, since I regard us all as living in continuous history and believe that we can only understand ourselves in the light of history."
The Walter Scott Prize is one of the UK's richest literary prizes, and honours Scott's achievements and his place as one of the world's most influential novelists.
To qualify, novels must be set at least 60 years ago, be written in English, and have been published in the preceding year. The 60-year rule comes from the subtitle of Scott's masterwork Waverley: 'tis Sixty Years Since.
Alistair Moffat, chairman of judges, said: "The judging panel had an apples-vs.-pears choice this year, from a bumper shortlist of seven books - our biggest shortlist ever.
"From the audacity of Martin Amis's concentration camp satire, to a post-modern mash-up of seventeenth-century court and contemporary references, via Sicily, India, Turkey and France, we journeyed and lived ten thousand lives ourselves during the reading and discussion of these books.
"In the end, it was the illumination shone by John Spurling on this fascinating and little-known period that lit us up for the longest time. It is a book which deserves enormous credit, and we hope that the Walter Scott Prize can help bring it for him."

The world's most beautiful stadium - the entire country of France - annually hosts the most important bike race of the year: the Tour de France. Upwards of 12 million fans line the roads to watch the race. For free. No tickets needed. The race traverses over 2000 miles in 21 days of racing. Every year the route changes, but the mountains are a constant: racers must scale absurdly steep peaks in both the Pyrenees and the Alps before a victory race onto the Champs Elysees in Paris. This year's tour may be remembered most for the spate of horrible crashes that have eliminated many of the top riders. Most outrageously, a media car hit a cyclist at speed, causing a horrific crash that sent another rider cartwheeling into a barbed-wire fence. Both riders remounted and finished the stage. The race goes on through July 24. -- Lane Turner ( 35 photos total
This is a Paid Song! Learn more…
I would like you to make an extended version of the song “Leaves from the Vine” that Iroh sings in the show “Avatar the Last Airbender”. I need it for a performance I'm doing in the spring.
Here is a link to the song that appeared in the show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFASos1G-5U
I'd like the song to follow the same feel and tempo, while staying under three minutes. Basically, I'd like the song to be as sad and as emotional as the original.
Here are the lyrics I came up with.
Leaves from the vine
Falling so slow
Like fragile, tiny shells
Drifting on the flow
Little soldier boy
Come marching home
Brave soldier boy
Comes marching home
Leaves from the wind
Flitting it seems
Turning on the breeze
Landing in the stream
Little soldier boy
Marching so far
Brave soldier boy
Is marching far
Leaves from the stream
Coasting aimlessly
O'er from bank to bank
Floating out to sea
Little soldier boy
Marching to war
Brave soldier boy
Marches to war
Leaves from the sea
Sailing helplessly
Tumbling on the waves
At the storm's mercy
Leaves from the vine
So far from mother tree
Travelling endlessly
Into destiny
Little soldier boy
Come marching home
Please, soldier boy
Come marching home

Martin said to his friend, Monichiko, "Should we dare the ixi next door, Rash, to fill up Nuriko's mailbox with water?" But, of course, Monichiko rattled and quivered: "But-but- dont you know that Nuriko is really a person called--" Suddenly, they heard a hag, who lived at the end of the road, yell--"Go go you brats! Dont you ever dare try to fill up my mailbox with water ever again, or I will turn you in a inu! A sick, old, dimwitted inu! So dont ever do it again..."
So... the ixi dragged a pail of water all the way to Nuriko's house. Rash muttered: "Some day I will avenge for your death..." He sighed, looking the sky, as though he was scanning it for his father. And shivered. Finally he apporached Nuriko's small shack... and a scream came from the inside, so bloodclurdling that Rash was forced to run for his life.
Dusty Baker has a reputation for hurting young pitchers due to overuse (Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press, File)
The Washington Nationals seemingly hired Bud Black to be their new manager last week, only to have contract talks fizzle. So this week, they were left to hire their second choice, Dusty Baker.
[Nats' manager search was a fiasco of the Lerner family's own making]
Baker has 20 years experience managing three teams — the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds — leaving him with a 1,671-1,504 record, one NL pennant (2002 Giants) and a reputation for not taking care of his pitching staff.
Waiting for reaction from Strasburg's elbow and Scherzer's shoulder on Nats' decision to hire Dusty Baker as manager. — rickbozich (@rickbozich) November 3, 2015
Now that Dusty Baker is manager So what is the line on whose arm FALLS OFF FIRST Harvey or Strasburg @ngreenberg — CBinDC (@CBJinDC) November 3, 2015
Many Cubs fans blame Baker for overusing Kerry Wood and Mark Prior and possibly wrecking their careers in the mid-2000s, but it appears Baker has indeed learned from his mistakes.
Early in his tenure as manager, Baker's starters were used in a large number of starts in which they saw their pitch count soar upwards of 120 pitches. For example, in 1999, the average NL team had 13 starting pitchers throw at least 120 pitches. Baker's Giants had 30 such starts. The following year, Baker's staff had nearly double the league average, 29 vs. 15. And that trend continued through his stint with the Cubs. However, beginning in 2008 with the Reds, Baker started to change his ways, falling in line with what we would expect from the league's other starting pitchers.
And not only did he work his starters less, they gave him an increasingly higher percentage of quality starts — at least six innings pitched with three or fewer earned runs allowed — during his time with the Reds.
In fact, Baker got a higher quality start percentage in his last year with the Reds (58 percent in 2013) than Matt Williams had last year with the Nationals (56 percent).
Who knows if Baker really did cause all the arm trouble for his pitchers a decade ago, but based on what we know from his recent managerial tendencies, the Nationals' pitching staff is in no more danger of faltering than they would be with anyone else managing the team.

Guillermo Pomarillo knows the reason he was admitted to Stanford University was because of hard work and not luck. But a recent dental visit forced him to write about his personal struggles in an open letter.
The first-generation college student detailed an interaction with his dentist, who attempted to undercut his accomplishments because of his ethnic and low-income background, in the letter he posted Monday on Facebook.
“Today, I came into your office after leaving work early,” Pomarillo wrote at the beginning of his letter. “Little did you know that I had to walk 1.5 miles to be able to make my appointment. My mother and father couldn't drive me because they were busy working. But, it was imperative for me to have my teeth cleaned before going to school.”
The Chicago-based student then described in detail how, after he mentioned he would attend Stanford soon, his dentist began to ask him about his ACT scores and made inappropriate comments about his low-income background:
You sarcastically said “Wow you got (blank) on the ACT?! And you got into Stanford?” I was confused, I had always thought my ACT score wasn't too bad. I mean, I got admitted into many other schools other than Stanny. You then said, “Well my daughter got a 35 and she didn't get into Stanford. She goes to Umich.” In my head I thought, “Wow that's great, UMich is a good school.” But you didn't stop there, you kept going. You said, “Well when you have kids from neighborhoods like THESE, like you know, ENGLEWOOD. It's easy for them to get into Harvard or Stanford with a (states my score).” In my mind, I was confused. Did he really just say that? But you didn't stop. You kept going. You said, “You know, when kids go to schools around here. (AKA public schools in minority neighborhoods) It's easier for them to get into schools like Stanford. My daughter goes to a school where like 20 kids get perfect ACT scores.” I stayed quiet.
But for Pomarillo, who will be studying biomedical engineering at Stanford according to his Facebook, the last straw was when the dentist said he should feel “lucky” to be going to Stanford:
Wait what? So you're telling me that 18 years of rigorous hard work is like going on The Voice. You're telling me that pure luck got me admitted into not only Stanford, but schools like Princeton, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, and WASHU, and waitlisted at Tufts, Penn, and Columbia (I didn't tell him this btw)?! To say that I was admitted into a school simply because of my background is ridiculous. OF COURSE YOUR DAUGHTER WAS GOING TO SCORE HIGHER THAN ME. You're a dentist that can afford to send her to a school that will help her achieve a score like that. You're an educated dentist, with a college degree and dentistry degree. My parents, two undocumented immigrants that only obtained a grammar school education, couldn't afford to send me to private schools. Yes, I may have grown up in a neighborhood that doesn't have many young kids going to schools like Stanford. But it doesn't mean that people where I come from don't have the potential to succeed at Stanford. We deserve to go to places like Stanford.
The student then wrote, “you belittled me... but you were completely ignorant of my struggles,” before he listed the many obstacles he faced growing up being financially disadvantaged while trying to excel academically despite having limited opportunities and resources.
“You are neglecting that I faced more struggles than your daughter. You are neglecting that all odds were against me,” he wrote. “But you feel entitled to say that I got ‘lucky' and that ‘because of where I come from' I got into Stanford... Maybe just maybe, the admissions panel saw beyond a score when seeing my profile. It doesn't mean that I'm better than your daughter. It means that I have the strength, the determination, the perseverance to succeed in a place like Stanford.”
College admissions based on affirmative action policies have long been used to give diverse and low-income students the opportunity to reach their potential at prestigious universities. And, according to Stanford's website, the university is committed to affirmative action goals.
Good morning! Spring is coming closer, an not only our (tiny London) flats need a spring clean, but our body will be thankful for one too! Luckily, Londoners have been jumping on the healthy eating bandwagon and you'll hear talks about the latest superfoods, smoothies, and the likes all around you. There are great places to get your fix on healthy eating (e.g. the lovely MAE Deli in Marylebone) and drinking (Press London is one of the pioneers in cold-press juices). In short- it's very much part of London's “Zeitgeist” nowadays.
Whether you are a total pro, curious on what its all about, or you are plainly confused because you just want to improve on your food without having to spend much on your hard earned cash at above mentioned locations – there are luckily also more and more workshops offered to get your hands dirty and your bellies filled. I have had the luck to be on a few events organised by Second Nature , run by the wonderful Denisa. She is a London based Romanian Health Coach and Raw Food Chef. She founded Second Nature,and delivers talks, raw food classes and retreats across the UK and Europe.
She is organising one of her signature Raw Food Workshops on March 1st, taking you on a journey through the wide world of Raw foods, including smoothies, soaking / sprouting, super food salads, fermented food, and – Desert. It's going to be a great hands-on evening, getting all your senses engaged and you'll go home full to the brim with lovely food and equipped with lots of tips, tricks and ideas to “try this at home” without breaking the bank!
If you are now hungry, make sure you grab something healthy, and if you have time for the workshop, why don't you give it a try? The workshop takes place in the Wild Goose in Leytonstone (E11 3AA) from 6.30 to 9.30 in the evening. It costs £65 and you can buy your tickets here. You can get 10% off by using the promotional code “WEBINAR”. (Disclaimer: I am not getting paid of benefiting in any way from recommending this workshop.I know Denisa through a few of her events and I learnt a lot during these occasions and had not only lots of fun there. This is why I am featuring this event and I am happy that I can offer this small discount to you. Also, all the pictures are from earlier events, so you might see different things, but just to get you the idea).
Guten Appetit!

Someone recently posted, somewhere online, a picture of me playing World of Warcraft while listening to a talk at the International Students for Liberty conference last weekend. It got quite a lot of attention, including, I am told, "over 5,000,000 click rate and 10k SHARE" in China.
My guess is that there are two things going on. One is that people who already know of my existence see this as evidence that I am a real person, not some academic off in outer space somewhere. The other is that people who have been told by their parents or other authority figures that playing WoW is a juvenile activity and a waste of time see the picture as evidence on their side of the argument.
My son Bill, having observed the phenomenon online, suggests that I ought to find some way of taking advantage of my temporary fame. His only idea was setting up an AMA on Reddit, something I might do if I can figure out how—I have done two AMA's in the past, but both were arranged by other people.
This post is an alternative approach. If lots of people are (briefly) looking at me, the obvious thing to do is to point them at things of mine that I would like them to read and that they might enjoy reading:
My web page , with lots and lots of stuff on it, including links to the full text of several of my books and most of my articles.
The Machinery of Freedom ( The third edition of my first book, Kindle . The hardcopy will be available shortly on Amazon).
Salamander, my second novel. ( , my second novel. ( Kindle . The hardcopy of that will also be available shortly on Amazon)
And for any who share my interests in recreational medievalism , two books coauthored with my wife:
A Miscellany. Free pdf. Hardcopy.
How to Milk an Almond, Stuff an Egg, and Armor a Turnip: A Thousand Years of Recipes. Free pdf. Hardcopy.
Enjoy.

Andy Craven opened scoring for Seattle Sounders FC with a goal in the 49th minute. Damion Lowe hammered a clearance and Craven spun, danced and pushed his way into space on the ball and tapped it over the Republic keeper. Sacramento Republic responded quickly when Justin Braun opened their book with a shot off a deflection.
Those goals early in the second half erased memories of an uneventful first half. Both teams pushed forward much more often. Seattle took advantage quickly. When Sam Garza came on for Aaron Kovar in the 69th minute he showed an immediate impact. Pablo Rossi executed a nifty chip to release Garza. Sam's first shot was blocked, but fell right to his feet. The second shot slotted home.
Craven's size and speed continued to cause problems for Republic. Released on a long ball he was taken down from behind. Sacramento took him down earning a yellow and a Rossi free kick from 26 yards out. Rossi's nailed the goal which was saved, banged off the post, into the keepers head and into the net. That's the kind Rossi magic to be expected for S2.
Now up 3-1 the flood gates continue.
An interchange sprung Victor Mansaray down the left flank. His cross went far post to Cristian Roldan who banged Seattle's fourth home.
Octavio Guzman responded with a late Republic free kick goal to shortly before the final whistle. The 4-2 final showed.
Seattle's starting lineup consisted of six first team signees. Two other first teamers came on in the second half. The dual goals of development and winning started with match one. Sounders 2 next face Whitecaps 2.
In an MSNBC segment titled "DREAMers On the Campaign Trail" a network correspondent talks to an illegal immigrant to explain what it's like to be "undocumented on the trail."
Liz Hernandez, a Sanders campaign volunteer in Las Vegas, says even though she cannot legally vote she is volunteering for the candidate in an effort to get her friends and people she knows to vote for the Democratic presidential hopeful. Hernandez says she wants to remind people Sanders needs to be president "in order for me to get ahead.
"Getting my friends to get out and caucus," Hernandez explained her reasoning. "Remind them and remind them. They know in order for me to get ahead, this is really important for me and my family."
According to the report, Hernandez crossed the border illegally at age in 10 in 2000.
Some major hospitals, aware of the inadequacy of the older C.D.C. guidelines, have followed more stringent standards in training their staff. But many — including Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where two nurses were infected by a dying patient — have not.
The Doctors Without Borders guidelines are even stricter than the new C.D.C. directives in that they require full coverage of the torso, head and legs with fabrics that blood or vomit cannot soak through, along with rubber aprons, goggles or face shields, sealed wrists and rubber boots. Doctors and nurses wear two sets of gloves, including long outer ones that strap or are taped to the gown; janitors wear three sets.
As they undress in choreographed steps, Doctors Without Borders workers wash their hands with chlorine solution eight times and are sprayed with a chlorine mist. Most important, all personnel disrobe only under the eyes of a supervisor whose job is to prevent even a single misstep.
Risky procedures like blood sampling are kept to a minimum.
“I've seen the C.D.C. poster,” said a Doctors Without Borders representative who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want to be named criticizing the agency, and who was referring to C.D.C. guidelines before they were changed on Tuesday. “It doesn't say anywhere that it's for Ebola. I was surprised that it was only one set of gloves, and the rest bare hands. It seems to be for general cases of infectious disease.”
National Nurses United, the country's largest union and professional association of nurses, with 185,000 members, criticized the C.D.C. on Wednesday for taking so long. Worse, the union said, many hospitals ignored even the lax guidelines because they were voluntary.
For example, the union said, nurses at the Texas hospital complained that the protective gear the hospital issued left their necks exposed — and they were told to wrap their necks with medical tape.
“They were learning infection control on the fly,” said DeAnn McEwen, chief of infection control for the union. “That's no substitute for planning.”
If you want to get away from the hoards of roaming tourists, this might be just the place for you. Berlin's Georgen-Parochial is right in the middle of the popular Friedrichshain district and dates back to the early 1800s.
This cemetery contains hundreds of old family plots, mausoleums and other interesting things to see. Keep your eyes open for damage from World War II which can be plainly seen in some areas.
A large portion of this cemetery is modern graves, if these don't interest you, stick to the outer areas of the cemetery (near the wall). There you will find the older, more extravagant graves.
Exploring the cemetery
Johann Carl J. Albrecht holds claim to the oldest marked grave in Georgen-Parochial II cemetery. To find this grave, enter at the Friedenstraße entrance near the southern tip of the cemetery and turn right on the first path.
Large parts of the eastern portion of this cemetery are overgrown with vegetation, while other parts are perfectly maintained.

In modern Germany, you don't buy a plot, you usually lease it for 20 years. Your relatives have the option of renewing the grave for an additional amount of time (and money). If the plot is not extended, the contents of the grave are removed and either buried deeper or in another location. They also take out the headstone, pulverize it into small rocks and use it for various other purposes. We noticed that some of the paths in this cemetery had tiny pieces of headstones jutting out of the dirt, no doubt to fill in the low spots.
Many of the older plots have ornamental fences in varying stages of decay.
A number of fences have fell victim to time and nature. They may have started out as a tiny tree to provide shade over a grave but have since completely taken over elements the plot.
The Mausoleaums
This cemetery has a ton of interesting mausoleums. This one, located near coordinates 52.521639, 13.445260 is the tomb of the Enders family, although only one name is listed inside: Carl Adolph Enders. The mausoleum is locked but the door is somewhat broken allowing a peak inside.
The tiled floors must have looked amazing when it was built, they probably just need a good scrub to bring them back to life.
Large family plots
In addition to the numerous mausoleums, this cemetery holds dozens of large scale family plots. It is apparent that Georgen-Parochial II cemetery is the final resting place of some extremely wealthy Berliners.
Even cemeteries didn't escape damage from the world wars. Across this cemetery, you can clearly see evidence of bullets and/or shrapnel damage to headstones and monuments.
We are lucky to have a glimpse of history behind the headstone. The brick makers name is clearly engraved on numerous bricks. We can see that the bricks came from Mögelin Rathenow. Mögelin lies east of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg. The Mögelin brick factory was founded in the mid-17th century and continued making bricks until the First World War, when the factory was closed.
The old and the new
The cemetery is surrounded on nearly all sides by modern development. In certain parts, you can see the developers didn't waste a spare inch when designing their buildings. Some of the neighboring buildings incorporate the cemetery memorials directly into their own walls.
How to get there
Note: There are no cemetery entrances along Auerstraße or Richard-Sorge-Straße.

Patrick Blanc has always been fascinated by plants. He was a child he created his first tropical aquarium filled with exotic species.
As a teenage student, the French botanist visited Malaysia and Thailand and noticed how plants grew vertically up cliffs, with their roots spreading inside the mosses on the rocks.
Blanc tried to imitate what he had seen when he returned home. He covered walls with old clothes and encouraged plants to take root and climb, with the aid of an irrigation system at the top of the installation. He called it Mur Vegetale, the Vertical Garden.
Mr Blanc has created hundreds of vertical gardens around the world, including a vertical Orchid Show, which has opened at the New York botanical garden.
Walking among 4,500 blooming orchids and 30,000 plants - while wearing green shirt, shoes and even green hair - Mr Blanc told the BBC about his passion for design.

The NFL has disbanded the seven-man crew of referees guided by chief official Pete Morelli after a terrible 2015 season, according to FootballZebras.com.
None of the seven will referee games together next season having been relocated to other crews.
Morelli, as Vikings fans might recall, was the chief referee of the controversial game between the Vikings and Saints in the 2009-10 NFC Championship. Morelli was sharply criticized for failing to flag the Saints after numerous illegal/unnecessary hits on Brett Favre and the Vikings, and Deadspin has the details on Morelli's latest miscues.

More interesting is the comments section in the Deadspin article, which is filled with complaints from Vikings fans about Morelli's crew.
One commenter wrote: "I'm about as apathetic a Vikings fan as can be, and I will go off for an hour on that game if I get going. Was my (expletive) birthday too."

Courtney Mattison is an artist and ocean advocate working to inspire policymakers and the public to conserve our changing seas. She primarily hand-sculpts intricately detailed ceramic sculptural works "inspired by the fragile beauty of coral reefs and the human-caused threats they face".
Courtney's large-scale ceramic coral reef installations for her ongoing series, Our Changing Seas, have been show around the United States in an effort to grab the attention of the public, raising awareness for the protection of our oceans. Mattison's process is laborious, to say the least:
"I sculpt delicate components like anemone tentacles and protruding coral polyps from porcelain, and roll out coils of gritty stoneware sculpture clay and pinch them together layer by layer to build the more massive pieces, which are all hollow. Once a piece is finished, I let it dry for a few days (or weeks depending on size) before firing it along with others in one of my two electric kilns. For sustainability reasons I always try to load my kilns as full as possible to cut down on energy consumption. Once a piece is fired it's ready to be glazed and fired a second time."
She's also a scuba diving enthusiast, and always makes sure to take her camera with her when she dives in order to collect the hundreds of images that are needed in order to accurately recreate a sculpted reef.
"I want people to feel inspired and curious, and then I want them to understand how tragic it would be to lose these ecosystems and to feel empowered to help." - Courtney Mattison
Mattison tries to be optimistic when considering the future of the planet's oceans, but she is also aware of the huge threats that endanger ecosystems such as coral reefs. RELATED: 7 things you can do (and not do) to protect coral reefs "The combination of human-caused climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, land-based sources of pollution and other major pressures are wreaking havoc on marine life around the globe, making vital ecosystems like coral reefs sick and threatening their survival. But, at least we understand and can develop solutions to these threats; it's just a matter of inspiring the world to care enough to act urgently to mitigate them."
“Many people simply don't know or care that the ocean is in trouble, or that humanity's welfare relies on a healthy blue planet.” - Courtney Mattison
While she admits, "news about the environment is bleak," Mattison is compelled to focus on the positive. "All of this doom and gloom doesn't inspire people to care or change their ways. It makes us feel helpless and guilty, so we ignore the problem and change the channel, believing that someone else will invent a way to fix it or it will go away on its own. This apathy is especially true for ocean-related issues that are largely out of sight, out of mind."
"But if art can lure us in, if it can spark a sense of curiosity and make us feel a positive connection to the exquisite and fragile forms of coral reef invertebrates and other critters that we don't think of on a daily basis, we will develop personal ties to them. Connections like this are what will drive us to vote for leaders and policies that value environmental preservation, make lifestyle and budgetary choices that prioritize sustainability, and use our skills—whatever they may be—to save the planet."

Most of the world is upset about Syria's use of chemical weapons against their own people – and it should be. It was yet another act of evil, and Bashar al-Assad is a monster. The world will be a better place without him.
But let's not pretend anyone is going to do anything to facilitate that. President Donald Trump's “targeted” bombing of the airfield from which the latest chemical attack was launched might stop chemical weapons from being used for a while, but it won't stop the slaughter in Syria. Because, although no one is willing to say it, the world doesn't care.
That's not to say people aren't bothered. Children gasping for air is a visual that moves all but a few. Still, what happens in Syria to Syrians doesn't affect the rest of the world in any tangible way. Therefore people are not moved to act. If they were, there would be a flood into Syria to join the rebels fighting both Assad and ISIS. As it is, millions of Syrians aren't even willing to stand up for their fellow countrymen, as able-bodied men flee the country rather than fight for themselves.
Since those in the firing line don't seem to care, the rest of the world isn't willing to do what is necessary to prevent what happened this week from happening again. If it were, one of the roughly a dozen previous chemical attacks would've caused action beyond bombing an airstrip. It didn't.
The world likes to be seen denouncing monsters and their inhuman actions, but it doesn't like actually doing anything about it unless forced. And the world is rarely forced to act in a meaningful way on matters of the actions of monsters.
The disaster in Syria is not the fault of the Trump administration. The Obama administration ignored multiple chemical weapons attacks by Assad because it was politically advantageous to do nothing. The media played along, casually mentioning the attacks happened – sometimes – and quickly moving on to the latest update on a Kardashian or some such distraction.
After his red line was obliterated by Assad, President Obama balked. He wasn't necessarily wrong to do nothing; he was wrong to draw the line if he wasn't willing to back it up. And he wasn't willing.
Eventually he cut a deal for Syria to give up its “declared” chemical weapons, congratulated himself and went golfing.
They never cared about Syria, but they had to be seen as caring about Syria. The deal gave them exactly that. From a policy standpoint, I'm not sure that was wrong. Horrible things happen all the time. The civilized world can't act simply because something horrific happened. But we should probably stop pretending to be surprised when they do.
When it comes to humanitarian crises that require more than money to address, we aren't interested. People would rather text some number to donate a couple of bucks to a cause so they can feel good about themselves than do anything tangible. It's a normal human reaction – if it doesn't affect them directly, they're not really wrong to.
By next week the world will have moved on to something else. But it's not next week yet. The bombs just flew, so we have politicians and journalists mounting their high horses and patting themselves on their backs for caring and others condemning the action as unlawful. Everyone falls in line behind whatever suits their political needs, and nothing changes.
We – every one of us – have to pretend to be outraged by awfulness. We have to pretend to be angry over action or inaction. We have to pretend to be saddened by unspeakable acts. But the truth, deep down, is something different.
What happened in Syria is horrible, but it's not unique. The world sat idly by when it happened in Syria before – as the bodies piled up in Darfur, as untold numbers were slaughtered in Rwanda and countless other places. Why should this time be any different?
When nearly 300 girls were kidnapped and forced into sex slavery by Boko Haram, the civilized world uniformly expressed outrage. To combat this evil act…a hashtag was launched: #BringBackOurGirls. Social media was flooded by people wanting to be seen caring. Soon after, people moved on. Most of the girls are still missing, and the world didn't do a damn thing that mattered.
The world only cares to be seen caring; acting is of no interest. Do you think the Russian government gives a damn about a chemical weapons attack? That China lost sleep over genocide anywhere? It may be immoral for the world to watch genocide and not act, but it is the world's default position.
If the great powers of the world really wanted to, they could wipe out ISIS and Assad and stop almost every atrocity. It would require a resolve it hasn't shown and serious, unfettered military action. The current political climate of the West won't allow it. Civilian casualties would be high and domestic support would collapse. We want to be heroes, but we want it to be neat. Like in the movies. But war isn't neat.
If World War II happened today, the West would be passing resolutions condemning Germany and Japan, the Jews would be eliminated and nation after nation would fall to tyranny.
I don't know what the answer is, but I know it's not bombing an airfield or pretending a problem doesn't exist. It lies somewhere in between and not with those who feel good about themselves for feeling bad for others. Maybe the first step is admitting that.
Kyle Shanahan officially took over as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, but during his introductory news conference Thursday he was peppered with questions about the Atlanta Falcons' Super Bowl LI loss.
The ex-Falcons offensive coordinator said the overtime loss to the New England Patriots was "as hard as anything I've gone through."
Shanahan came under fire after the defeat for several play-calls, including a pass on third-and-1 that led to a Matt Ryan fumble and not rushing the ball three times to set up a field goal that would have given Atlanta a double-digit lead late in the game.
Shanahan also was asked about a report that cited him saying "I blew it" after the game.
"I don't know if I used those exact words, but that sounds about how I talk," he said. "...I did believe we had a very good chance to win that game, especially at the end and we didn't get it done. When you use the words 'I blew it,' I don't look at it that way, I believe we missed an opportunity and we didn't get it done. I'll go back through every play for the rest of my life."
Now taking over the reins in San Francisco, Shanahan said the loss wouldn't linger because playing aggressive is part of his DNA.
"We played that game how we played the entire year," he said. "I called plays in that game the way I have the entire year. Doesn't mean I'm always right. Doesn't mean they're always going to work. But I promise you I prepare as hard as I possibly can. I always do what I believe is right, with our coaching staff and with the players, and then you live with the consequences.
"Yeah, it's going to be hard living with that loss. Every play that didn't work, I regret, as always. But I can deal with it because I can look at myself in the mirror and know I did what I thought was right at the time. And that was the most important thing to me. I didn't change because of a circumstance. I did what I thought was right. Whatever happens, if you do what you thought was right and you believed in that because of the preparation you had, you should be able to live with the consequences."
Shanahan's aggressive approach helped make the Falcons the league's best offense in 2016. The play-calls in the Super Bowl are easy to question in hindsight after they weren't executed on the field. As he takes over the 49ers' head gig, Shanahan won't lose his aggressive style after a historic collapse.
Americans like to associate their spam with other countries. They joke about Chinese spammers or Nigerians or Russians. It's a time-honored nativist tradition.
But, according to the new quarterly report from the security and spam monitoring company, Sophos, computers inside these United States relay—by far—the most spam. And we have in every quarter of the past year.
To be clear, Sophos doesn't measure the point of origin for the spam, but something more embarrassing and troubling. Spam is relayed by compromised computers strung into vast networks called botnets. So what we really see here is the deeply insecure state of American computing, more than the number of ne'er-do-wells.
According to the 2013 spam trend report by Kaspersky security, nearly 70 percent of email traffic flow is now spam. (It's worth looking at Kaspersky's list of spammy countries by email point of origin: China is number one, but we're number two.)
In a very competitive situation, with multiple networks pursuing, ABC has landed Get Christie Love, an hourlong drama from Power creator/showrunner Courtney Kemp and producers Vin Diesel, Debra Martin Chase and Shana C. Waterman, with a pilot production commitment.
The project, a co-production between Lionsgate Television and Universal Television, is inspired by the cult 1974 blaxploitation-themed TV movie Get Christie Love! and subsequent short-lived series, which also aired on ABC. (you can watch a trailer for the movie below the post.)
The new Get Christie Love (no ! in the title), written by Kemp, is an action-packed, music-driven drama that centers on Christie Love, an African American female CIA agent who leads an elite ops unit. She transforms into whomever she needs to be to get the job done, especially when it's down to the wire and the stakes are life and death. The high-adrenaline missions of the series are anchored by an emotional mystery about Christie's first love — unearthing the truth about this relationship will be the biggest mission impossible of her life.
Kemp executive produces via her production company End of Episode, along with Diesel and Waterman through One Race Television and Martin Chase through Martin Chase Productions.
This has been a passion project for Kemp, who loved the original because of Christie's poise, strength and femininity. She started working on a remake before she got Power on Starz where it has become the network's highes- rated series.
Get Christie Love marks the first sale for Kemp and her production company End of Episode under a multi-year overall deal with Starz and sibling Lionsgate Television she signed in May. Kemp and Universal TV-based Diesel, both repped by CAA, brought the idea of rebooting the title to Uni TV, which owns the rights to it. Under his overall deal at Uni TV, Diesel also executive produces a reboot of Miami Vice for NBC.
The 1974 Get Christie Love! ABC series was the first hourlong drama with an African American actress as the lead. Now the reboot was bought by ABC, which is run by the first black woman appointed broadcast network president, Channing Dungey, from Uni TV, the first major U.S. TV studio headed by a black woman president, Pearlena Igbokwe.
Kemp made her debut as showrunner with Power, which premiered in 2014. The drama hit a viewership season high this year, with 2.0 million viewers tuning into the fourth season finale. It will return for Season 5 in 2018.
Kemp is repped by CAA and attorney Michael Gendler. One Race Television is repped by CAA, manager Stacy O'Neil, and attorneys Patty Felker and Eric Suddleson. Martin Chase Prods. is repped by CAA and attorneys Nina Shaw and Laurie Megery.
Netflix has opened up its wallet to lock down a new digital streaming deal with the Walt Disney Co. that gives it exclusive access to new and catalog titles from the Mouse House during the pay TV window in the U.S. Disney's existing pact with Starz wraps up at the end of 2015.
Although financial terms of the multi-year agreement were not disclosed, sources close to the companies say Starz had ponied up around $100 million to Disney. Netflix is said to be spending $200 million, with some analysts saying that figure comes closer to $300 million.
Netflix's largesse further raises the stakes for rights to high-end film and TV content in a marketplace where traditional players are increasingly competing with deep-pocketed digital upstarts. News of the pact drove Netflix shares up 14%, or $10.65, to close at $86.65. The spike was notable given that some Wall Streeters have been questioning whether Netflix is becoming overextended in its content licensing commitments.

The Disney pact will significantly increase Netflix's family offerings — especially for its “Netflix Kids” and “Just for Kids” sections on its site and mobile app, which offers up content for kids under 12. So far, the service has focused on characters like SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer and Curious George.
Netflix had already enticed DreamWorks Animation to end its pay TV deal with HBO last year in order to move its films over to the SVOD service.
New Mouse House deal includes titles from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios and Disneynature. It begins with theatrical releases in 2016.
Also included are Disney direct-to-video releases, to be made available on Netflix starting in 2013. Separately, Disney and Netflix will make catalog titles such as “Dumbo,” “Pocahontas” and “Alice in Wonderland” available to Netflix subs in the U.S.
Disney's content will be available for instant viewing on multiple platforms, including TVs, tablets, computers and mobile phones.
“Disney and Netflix have shared a long and mutually beneficial relationship, and this deal will bring to our subscribers, in the first pay TV window, some of the highest-quality, most imaginative family films being made today,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix. “It's a bold leap forward for Internet television, and we are incredibly pleased and proud this iconic family brand is teaming with Netflix to make it happen.”
Netflix has more than 30 million members in 40 countries who watch more than 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies per month. Company, which charges $8 a month for unlimited streaming, consistently accounts for 33% of online traffic during peak periods, followed by Amazon (1.8%), Hulu (1.4%) and HBO Go (0.5%).
As streaming services look to build their libraries, studios are benefitting financially from the demand for content. Disney is said to have eschewed talks with more traditional pay TV players like HBO or Showtime and sought a heftier increase in license fees for its films from digital players eager to compete for movie rights and willing to dig deep into their pockets.
Last month, Disney chief Bob Iger was upbeat on the opportunities that growing digital platforms are providing to studios. “The opportunity to monetize owned IP is only growing because of new technology,” Iger said during a conference call with analysts last month to discuss fiscal-year results. “We will see growth in revenue and bottom line. It's an exciting time for intellectual property owners.”
Disney is the latest studio to forgo traditional pay TV pacts for Netflix, after Relativity Media, FilmDistrict and Open Road brokered similar deals.
Unclear is whether such SVOD deals will further impact traditional DVD and Blu-ray disc sales.
“With it more than clear that the DVD slide is secular, the embrace of SVOD as a pay TV replacement is somewhat of an acknowledgment that the need to protect the DVD window no longer makes as much sense as it once did,” Stifel Nicolaus analysts said in a report.
In a statement, Starz said execs made the decision not to renew its output pact with the Mouse House so it could invest more in original series. It already produces the “Spartacus” franchise, “Magic City” and the upcoming “Da Vinci's Demons.” The pay cabler's goal is to have 50-60 hours of original series programming by 2015. The loss of Disney pics, however, comes at a tough time for Starz as it is preparing to be spun off from parent company Liberty Media.
“Starz will continue to be the exclusive home of all Disney movies, including the Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar releases, and their accompanying digital streaming rights, into 2017,” Starz said. “Our decision not to extend the agreement for Disney output past that time allows us the opportunity to implement our plan to dramatically ramp up our investment in exclusive, premium-quality original series which will best meet the needs of our distributors and subscribers.”
Happy Pi Day from GTM Research!
To celebrate, we'd like to dish out a juicy pie chart of PV installation numbers.
As noted in the most recent U.S. Solar Market Insight report, GTM Research is forecasting nearly 6 gigawatts of photovoltaics to be installed in the United States in 2014, representing 26 percent growth year-over-year.

Bill Still has some interesting information that he presents with the caveat that it was sent to him by an anonymous source regarding the Seth Rich murder. It purports to be from a girlfriend of Rich's named Claudia Kash. He notes that that is not the same girlfriend who was pictured with the Rich family when they visited the scene of the crime in August of 2016.
Still acknowledges that Rich could easily have had two girlfriends, “So let's see what Claudia Kash had to say. This letter,” he says, “is dated July 21st, about two weeks after his death.” She details a duplicate set of polling locations, one for the general public which were listed on state websites, and another for Hillary Clinton supporters which were identified on the Clinton website.
The locations listed on the Clinton website were not known to the various Secretaries of State and were not on state records. Kash describes how she believes the scam worked. “While most voters looked up their location on their state website, voters who were signed up as Hillary Clinton supporters would be directed to her site to find their polling place.”
She continues, “It was set up the same as any other DNC polling place, with DNC volunteers, regular voting machines, etc. And a duplicate voter roster, the same as the roster at the other polling place. Voters would be checked off on the roster, same as at the other polling place, period. And after the polls close, the DNC supervisor would pick up the roster at the legitimate polling place and the ballots there.”
Kash says, “He or she would then replace a number of Bernie Sanders ballots with an equal number of ballots from the Hillary Clinton voting location. Then the duplicate roster from the HRC [location] would be shredded and thrown away along with all the Bernie Sanders ballots that had been replaced. That way the number of people who voted still matches the number of ballots. This is why so many states reported a lower than expected voter turnout.”
“Seth Rich,” says Kash, “wrote the app that allowed the scam to work by finding the Clinton polling stations although, she contends, he didn't realize there was a second, fraudulent set of locations until he went to vote himself.
Still points out there was a heated exchange between Rich and then-DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile shortly before he was killed. He notes that this provides, if the letter and events prove to be genuine, an indication of another possible motive for the Rich murder aside from the WikiLeaks email scandal. How deep was the involvement of the Clinton campaign and the Democrats party? Was this the work of frequent White House guest Bob Creamer and his boys, the ones who roughed up Trump supporters on behalf of Hillary Clinton and Hussein Obama?

Universal Orlando's twin roller coasters will never race each other again after a man 'lost his eyeball' on intertwining ride
For a decade it has been the most thrilling experiences at Universal Orlando, riding on the park's twin roller coasters as they race at 60mph and intertwine within 18 inches of each other.
But the park is altering its signature ride the Dragon Challenge after a man claims he had his eyeball removed in one of two horrific accidents on the ride.
Officials have announced that they will no longer launch the twin roller coasters simultaneously following an internal investigation stemming from the incidents this summer.

Ride: The roller coaster is being altered after a man claims he had his eyeball removed in one of two horrific accidents on the ride
'We believe this is the best path forward for our guests and for the attraction,' a spokesman told the Orlando Sentinel.
The park started launching the two coasters - the Chinese Fireball dragon and the Hungarian Horntail dragon - on a staggered basis after two riders were thought to have been struck by loose objects. That change has now become permanent.
In one case, a 52-year-old man suffered a lacerated right eye while riding Dragon Challenge on July 31. The man's lawyer says he had his eyeball removed.
The park has refused to discuss what exactly happened in the incidents, but in a statement it reminded guests to secure all loose items, suggesting that they may have been caused by items falling out of guests' hands or pockets.
Two weeks after Carlos Montalvo, a Puerto Rican, lost his eye on the ride, a 19-year-old said he was hit by something on the attraction.
Coaster: Officials have announced that they will no longer launch the twin roller coasters simultaneously following an internal investigation
Plan: The roller coasters used to intertwine within 18 inches of each other
Jon Wilson, from Ohio, said that he was hit on his foot, arm and face.
The ride was built when Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park opened in 1999 and was called 'Duelling Dragons' but was re-branded when it received a themed makeover when the park opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter last year.
Passengers on the ride, which lasts two minute and twenty-five second, are suspended with their legs dangling below and pass through five inversions.
The ride has had few accidents and was built to calculate the weight of the two coasters when filled with passengers so that their timing was optimised.
Records reveal that there have only been five reported injuries on the ride during the past decade, but lawyers for the man who lost his eye claim others have gone unreported.
Accidents: The issue of loose objects has become more of a problem for roller coaster operating as more guests carry smartphones and other devices
'We are aware of several other incidents where people have been struck by objects [while riding Dragon Challenge], Mr Montalvo's lawyer Clay Mitchell told the Orlando Sentinel.
The issue of loose objects has become more of a problem for roller coaster operating as more guests carry smartphones and other devices.
'Today, we hear a lot about cell phones because people are trying to take pictures while they're riding,' Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Sometimes they lose their grip, and the thing flies out.'
A Universal spokesman said that the park has many warning signs and has staff in ride queues to help spot potential problems.

A restaurant at the Santa Monica, Calif., airport closed its doors and its chef and parent company were charged with misdemeanors after a sting operation coordinated by federal agents and animal rights captured them offering "pink broad slices" of what turned out to be Sei whale, an endangered species. The operation was captured by a documentary film crew.
And now, three years later, two chefs and the ownership of the Hump's parent company are being charged with nine counts of conspiracy to import and sell whale meat, felonies that could carry hefty prison sentences.

As reported by the Los Angeles Times:
The indictment accuses Typhoon Restaurant Inc., which is the parent company of the now-closed Hump restaurant, and chef Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 48, of Culver City; and chef Susumu Ueda, 39, of Lawndale of conspiring to import and sell the meat of Sei whales, which are listed as an endangered species. According to an indictment, Yamamoto and Ueda allegedly ordered the whale meat from Ginichi Ohira, a Japanese national who previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of illegally selling a marine mammal product. Once Ohira received the whale meat in the United States, he prepared an invoice that incorrectly described the meat as fatty tuna and delivered the whale meat to the Hump, according to the indictment.
If convicted, Yamamoto could face up to 67 years in federal prison. Ueda would serve up to a decade.
The restaurant's parent company currently faces fines of $1.2 million.
When Dr. Kathryn Ko is not operating on a brain, she is painting one.
“It's the most beautiful thing on earth, hands down,” said Dr. Ko, 59, a neurosurgeon at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn. “The power, the meaning. It's what we are. And I get to see it alive.”
As a surgeon and a painter, Dr. Ko specializes in the anatomy of the brain and cranium. Her art — whether realistic pieces or the more abstract and conceptual works — springs directly from her 30 years of emergency surgery experience in hospitals in New York City.
When a classical trumpeter from a Russian orchestra took a bad fall during a performance in New York in 2010, Dr. Ko performed emergency surgery at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, helping to preserve both his life and his playing career. Afterward, she painted his portrait, complete with the scar across his scalp.
And when she was called to a city morgue to examine the skull of an unidentified man found in the Bronx, she wound up painting it. She has made paintings that show her operating alongside her surgical team and has created a homage to a favorite pneumatic cranial drill. Dr. Ko, who has an acute ear for musical pitch, had noticed that the drill emitted a G sharp when rotating at the proper operating speed. She made a painting of her using the drill and named it “Craniotomyin G Sharp.”
The fourth day is here! We are halfway through the Eat Your Comics 8 Days of Who is a Countdown. This coming Saturday , the BBC will finally air series 8 of Doctor Who to us, the geeks who waited.
Today, A Good Man Goes to War in our list of episodes of re-watchable, influential, and all around cool episodes of Doctor Who that are worth a revisit before the premier.
Episode: A Good Man Goes to War (Series 6, Episode 7)
Written by: Steven Moffat
Air date: 4 June 2011
IMDB Synopsis: Amy now has a baby, but she and Melody are held captive in the season finale by panto-style villain Madame Kovarian (Frances Barber) and the Doctor is raising an army to rescue her as the drama continues. But as he and Rory race across galaxies, calling in long-held debts and solemnly given promises, his enemies are laying a carefully concealed trap.
In her cell in Stormcage, River Song sadly acknowledges that the time has come at last today will mark the Battle of Demons Run and the Doctors the darkest hour. Both sides will make their sacrifices and River Song must finally reveal her most closely guarded secret to the Doctor.
Why this episode is important:
In series 6, Matt Smith is the Doctor: a floppy, silly, cool regeneration. By this point in his reign at the helm of the TARDIS, we have met some strange aliens along his travels and in War, a few of them come back to repay a debt to him.
By this time, throughout a few episodes, we've seen someone popping in on Amy, and this is the episode we find out why. Excruciating pain strikes Amy, and the Doctor explains that she is going into labor. She wakes up to see the same, eye patched lady gazing down at her. The Amy that's been along with the Doctor and Rory is actually a flesh copy that her conscious has been able to inhabit, but she had really all along been on Demon's Run. She delivers a girl, Melody, and the Doctor and Rory (who in this episode is The Last Centurion, and a total and complete badass) are racing to find them.
The Doctor calls in debts from aliens we've met over the seasons, and brings them together for the battle of Demon's Run, which Rory desperately tries to recruit River for, but she can not go.
This episode is so fun to watch: from the multiple characters coming back for a battle to the final reveal of who River is to the Doctor. It's something that can only be a Moffat story-line with the twists in plot and bread crumbs along the way to the final scenes. No matter how many times I watch this one, I get chills when River can finally spill the beans to Amy, Rory and the Doctor as to who she really is. Matt Smith is a joy to watch in this scene, his emotional range is all over the place and it's perfect.
down pieces, here it's just all respect for the guy's story-lines today. This episode is the perfect example of how complicated, wonderful and emotional his scripts can be. He keeps River's spoilers from us so well throughout his other episodes, that when they are finally revealed it is so worth the wait. As much as I joke about Moffat being a character killer in our day 6 and day 5 countdown pieces, here it's just all respect for the guy's story-lines today. This episode is the perfect example of how complicated, wonderful and emotional his scripts can be. He keeps River's spoilers from us so well throughout his other episodes, that when they are finally revealed it is so worth the wait.

Demons run when a good man goes to war. Night will fall and drown the sun when a good man goes to war. Friendship dies and true love lies. Night will fall and the dark will rise when a good man goes to war. Demons run but count the cost; the battle's won but the child is lost.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Muslim advocacy group evacuated its national headquarters on Capitol Hill on Thursday after receiving a letter containing white powder, but staff were later allowed to re-enter after authorities conducted preliminary tests and deemed the substance harmless.
The letter received by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) also contained a note that read, “Die a painful death, Muslims,” according to CAIR staff attorney Maha Sayed.
“Our fear is at a pretty high level at this time, given the anti-Muslim rhetoric going on,” said Sayed.
In California, a CAIR branch office in the Bay Area city of Santa Clara, was also evacuated on Thursday after receiving an envelope with an unknown powder inside, CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. Further details were not available because local authorities could not immediately be reached.
Law enforcement authorities and Muslim communities around the United States have braced for a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment after two Muslims shot dead 14 people in California last week. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism.
The presence of white powder in the letter sent to CAIR was reminiscent of the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people and sickened 17.
The FBI has taken possession of the letter, and will test it further, according to FBI spokesman Andrew Ames.
About three CAIR employees came into contact with the powder and were quarantined in the building while police and firefighters investigated the scene, said group spokesman Hooper, adding that the rest of the office staff waited outside on the sidewalk.
CAIR staff attorney Sayed said on the group's Facebook page that the organization receives hate messages daily.
“It's frightening to experience the hate manifest itself to such a real level. This will not deter us from continuing to protect the civil rights and liberties of all Americans,” Sayed said.
The incident occurred days after Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States, sparking outrage in the nation and around the globe.
, lead developer at IniTechMobile, should have known better.
The company was moments away from launching an Android port of their popular app, WereWolfTasks. The task management app plays a video of a transforming werewolf if the user doesn't complete his to-do list before a full moon. Because IniTechMobile was an iOS shop, they outsourced the Android port to VampMobile, an eastern European company that specialized in iOS to Android ports.
The app launched on Google Play. Almost immediately, complaints flooded Support's ticket log. "The werewolf video is all smushed when I rotate my phone!" "My tasks keep getting erased every time my phone restarts!" "Why are the tooltips all in Romanian?"
When Troy emailed VampMobile to troubleshoot the issues, he found they had vanished like Dracula transforming into bats.
Well, I know a little Java, Troy thought, as he settled in for a weekend-long debug session. First I'll look at some of the interface bugs to get my bearings.
The code was as barren and foreign as a vampire's keep: no code comments, lots of spaghetti logic, and half the method names written in Romanian. He did find a few variables in English, such as "activity_home_854." Digging around, he found the sole instance it was used:
WindowManager w = getWindowManager(); Display d = w.getDefaultDisplay(); int height = d.getHeight(); if(height != 854){ setContentView(R.layout.activity_home); } else{ setContentView(R.layout.activity_home_854); }
Why didn't they use Android's built-in scaling utilities? Troy wondered. And what device with a screen height of 854 pixels would need a separate interface?
By the end of the weekend, he felt as though his blood had been sucked dry. WereWolfTasks for Android would get an update that morning, fixing most of the bugs. For some reason, vampires seemed scarier to Troy than werewolves after that.
What Will Fort Worth Look Like in 2030?
Fort Worth is growing faster than ever. See what to expect in 2030.
Major General Williams Jenkin Worth undoubtedly would be astounded by the growth happening in his namesake town.
Fort Worth, TX, is in the midst of explosive expansion. By one estimate, Fort Worth's population will surge past 1.2 million in 2030. That would represent growth of close to 50 percent compared with 2014. Surrounding communities are seeing a similarly large influx of people.
For years, glitzy Dallas overshadowed its “Cowtown” neighbor. But now, Fort Worth is coming into its own as an on-the-rise global city.
“Fort Worth continues to strengthen its position as one of the top destinations in the nation in which to live and work,” says David Berzina, executive vice president for economic development at the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce. “Year after year, we continue to experience growth in all industries, as businesses seek regions and communities that offer ample land, a centralized location, limited regulatory restrictions, a low cost of living and a high quality of life – all of which we offer in Fort Worth.”

WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange, the controversial data dumper behind "cablegate," has already signaled his next target: Wall Street. In an interview with Forbes, Assange says that early next year, he will expose corruption at "a big U.S. bank," in a "megaleak" that "could take down a bank or two." Although Assange declined to be more specific, speculation is swirling around Bank of America. After the chaos WikiLeaks wreaked in diplomatic circles, should the largest U.S. bank, or Wall Street as a whole, "start panicking"? (Watch a CNBC discussion about the rumors)
How much worse can Assange make Wall Street look? Could WikiLeaks really topple a big U.S. bank? "Probably not," says Halah Touryalai in Forbes. At worst it could temporarily "drive down the stock price of the bank in play" — a consequence that Bank of America is already dealing with, based on the early speculation. Even if the U.S. were willing to let a large bank fail, what secrets could Assange reveal that two years of intense media and legal scrutiny have failed to unearth already?
"WikiLeaks can't wipe out a major bank"
Assange wants to create anarchy. Wall Street should be worried: In a former job at a big U.S. bank, says an anonymous analyst at Stone Street Advisors, "I knew enough about how screwed up certain things were" that I could have made trouble. By "playing God" with legitimate business tools like "trade secrets," Assange will send 2008-style "ripples throughout the capital markets."
"Thoughts on WikiLeaks & efficient markets"
He's got nothing. Banks have tighter security than the government: Thanks to "a decade of prosecutorial aggression," bankers have learned to never write down anything they'd be unwilling to see "blown up into a 48-point headline," says Megan McArdle in The Atlantic. And if they did document some sort of criminal activity, no one would be able to access it since bank IT workers are "pretty diligent about making sure that you only have access to the stuff you're authorized for." So like the diplomatic cables, Assange likely has "a bunch of stuff that is embarrassing" but no true smoking guns.
"WikiLeaks targets a bank"
Nobel prize-winning economist George Akerlof co-wrote a paper in 1993 describing the causes of the S&L crisis and other financial meltdowns. As summarized by the New York Times:
In a word, the investors looted. Someone trying to make an honest profit, Professors Akerlof and Romer [co-author of the paper, and himself a leading expert on economic growth] said, would have operated in a completely different manner. The investors displayed a “total disregard for even the most basic principles of lending,” failing to verify standard information about their borrowers or, in some cases, even to ask for that information.
In the paper, they argued that several financial crises in the 1980s, like the Texas real estate bust, had been the result of private investors taking advantage of the government. The investors had borrowed huge amounts of money, made big profits when times were good and then left the government holding the bag for their eventual (and predictable) losses.
The Times does a good job of explaining the looting dynamic:
The paper's message is that the promise of government bailouts isn't merely one aspect of the problem. It is the core problem.
Promised bailouts mean that anyone lend money to Wall Street — ranging from small-time savers like you and me to the Chinese government — doesn't have to worry about losing that money. The United States Treasury (which, in the end, is also you and me) will cover the losses. In fact, it has to cover the losses, to prevent a cascade of worldwide losses and panic that would make today's crisis look tame.
But the knowledge among lenders that their money will ultimately be returned, no matter what, clearly brings a terrible downside. It keeps the lenders from asking tough questions about how their money is being used. Looters — savings and loans and Texas developers in the 1980s; the American International Group, Citigroup, Fannie Mae and the rest in this decade — can then act as if their future losses are indeed somebody else's problem.
Do you remember the mea culpa that Alan Greesnspan, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, delivered on Capitol Hill last fall? He said that he was “in a state of shocked disbelief” that “the self-interest” of Wall Street bankers hadn't prevented this mess.
He shouldn't have been. The looting theory explains why his laissez-faire theory didn't hold up. The bankers were acting in their self-interest, after all…Think about the so-called liars' loans from recent years: like those Texas real estate loans from the 1980s, they never had a chance of paying off. Sure, they would deliver big profits for a while, so long as the bubble kept inflating. But when they inevitably imploded, the losses would overwhelm the gains…
What happened? Banks borrowed money from lenders around the world. The bankers then kept a big chunk of that money for themselves, calling it “management fees” or “performance bonuses.” Once the investments were exposed as hopeless, the lenders — ordinary savers, foreign countries, other banks, you name it — were repaid with government bailouts.
In effect, the bankers had siphoned off this bailout money in advance, years before the government had spent it…Either way, the bottom line is the same: given an incentive to loot, Wall Street did so. “If you think of the financial system as a whole,” Mr. Romer said, “it actually has an incentive to trigger the rare occasions in which tens or hundreds of billions of dollars come flowing out of the Treasury.”
In fact, the big banks and sellers of exotic instruments pretended that the boom would last forever, siphoning off huge profits during the boom with the knowledge that – when the bust ultimately happened – the governments of the world would bail them out.
Minister of Environmental Protection Avi Gabay (Kulanu) announced on Friday that he was resigning from the government in protest to Avigdor Lieberman's joining it. He reportedly admitted that the appointment of the Yisrael Beytenu chairman as minister of defense was "a step that he couldn't live with." He held a press conference on Friday morning.

"After much deliberation the chairman of Kulanu movement and the minister of finance, Moshe Kahlon, that I have decided to resign from my position as minister of environmental protection," Gabay announced. "Despite the great importance that I see in the ministry and the significant actions that we are promoting to reduce air pollution and in many other areas, the recent political maneuvers and replacement of the minister of defense are, in my eyes, a grave act that ignores what is important to the security of to sate and will cause further radicalizing rifts in the nation.

"This is a policy that I cannot be partnered to, and it is too essentially a matter for me to continue as a member of the government."
"I would like to thank the chairman of Kulanu for his support, his faith and his help, and I have no doubt that the Kulanu movement will continue to leave its mark on important goals that we set on establishing (the party)," he summarized.
Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning, Kahlon stated, "I couldn't come to terms with Ya'alon's ouster."
He spoke on the relationship with the United States: "It wasn't easy for me to be a part of the government, a government that completely disrupted our relationship with the strongest power in the world."
Addressing his resignation, he said, "This week, a year after I entered the position, came something that I just couldn't stomach: Lieberman's appointment to minister of defense, which is in my opinion irregular even in the cynical world of politics. The minister of defense is the most important minister."
"I urge the prime minister to pull himself together and remember that the security is security, and he is relying on people and leadership, not only on tanks and planes."
Gabay ended by saying, "I'm sorry, but I promised myself and my family that I would never be a cynical politician, but rather a leader and public servant. In light of my comprehension of the recent political maneuvering, continuing with the current government would not be in keeping with my promise."
Moshe Ya'alon, who resigned as minister of defense, said on Gabay's resignation, "In our political system, insisting on principles became subject to ridicule, while zigzagging and deceit are considered 'sophisticated.' A full assessment of Avi Gabay proves that another way is possible. We must not give up."
Kahlon wrote on his Facebook timeline, "Yesterday, the Minister of Environmental Protection Avi Gabay informed me of his intention to resign from the government. I updated the prime minister on the subject and informed him that I intended to continue holding the environmental protection portfolio. Over the past year, we laid important and material groundwork at the Ministry of Environmental Protection for the quality of life for all citizens of Israel. The national plan for reducing pollutants in the Haifa Bay will continue alongside other important initiatives that the ministry led under Gabay."
The outgoing minister was prominent in his opposition to the gas deal. "The state must listen and understand the companies' claims and demands and then utilize its authority and sovereignty on this matter in order to arrive at the plan that is best for the citizens of Israel," he said at the time.
At the press conference, Gabay stated, "In my eyes, there is a clear line that connects the gas deal to the attack on the chief of staff and the IDF."

Recently, Gabay expressed his support for IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, who received criticism for drawing comparisons between current Israeli sentiment and that of Europe in the 1930s, which led to the Holocaust. Said Gabay, "Maj. Gen. Golan has sufficient rights and viewpoints so that we should listen to his words without attacking him. The fervor around Golan is misguided. We need to encourage senior officials to speak their truth and not vice versa."
Gabay added, "I don't believe that he was talking about the Second World War and the Holocaust. There's nothing similar to what is happening here to the Holocaust, but there are definitely here violent fervors and signs of racism that are similar at times to the fervor in Germany of the 20s and 30s.
Gabay , 49, was previously the CEO of Bezeq for six years, where he managed to increase its profits during a particularly competitive time in the telephone market. He did so while maintaining good relations with the employees and regulators.
After leaving that position, he worked in the public sector. In one position, he headed the committee to examine the crisis in Hadassah Hospital. Gabay was the first to publicly join Kahlon in establishing Kulanu and was the chief of staff before the election, though he did not himself figure on the list of candidates. He was appointed minister by Kahlon's insistence.
I wanted to say something about Jack Wilshere after he spoke this week about me giving him Paul Scholes' number so he could speak to Paul about his comments on Sky a few months back. He's a fantastic talent. The more I've worked with him with England, the more I like him as a person. He's actually very similar to Paul Scholes in his nature. He's got a fight about him. He's got immense talent. He's been unlucky with injuries in the early part of his career but he's a unique talent and we need him desperately for England. He's a midfield player who accepts the ball so well, he can manipulate the ball, he can beat men, he can play one-twos and he sees the big picture out on the pitch.
When Paul Scholes speaks about you, it's a compliment. While Scholes' words may have come across as critical, he wouldn't even bother speaking about 99.9% of football players, he wouldn't give them the time of day. I know how much he rates Wilshere though. He wants Jack to be one of the best midfielders in the world, because he believes he has the talent. Some of his performances for England have been outstanding. He brings something completely different and when I watch him in training, he's one of those players, like Scholes, that if you have him on your team, he dominates possession and keeps things moving.
The way in which he has handled the conversation he had with Scholes and how he has talked about it this week shows a mature man who isn't sitting there whingeing. He's fronted up to it and that's what I like about him. In interviews, he's willing to comment on the difficult things, he's willing to stand out. He's got an opinion and he's a big character. If he stays clear of injury at the World Cup he is the type of player who could impress this summer in Brazil.
Jack Wilshere's possession style will be a big part of how I see the FA Cup final playing out tomorrow with Arsenal dominating the ball. Wembley can be an energy-sapping pitch and so keeping possession will be key, particularly in those last 15 minutes. I think Hull will need that something to hang on to and for me, while it's a cliché in football, the first goal is going to be absolutely crucial. I remember when we were favourites in the 1995 final but lost to Everton. We conceded a goal before half time and just couldn't get back in to it. That could be similar with Hull tomorrow, if they score first they could make it very difficult for Arsenal.
I think Arsenal will win the game though and their trophy drought is going to come to an end. I'd love to see my old teammate Steve Bruce win but I just feel that the quality of Arsenal will see them come out on top.
Steve Bruce has done a better job at Hull than most including Gus Poyet at Sunderland in my opinion. Poyet has kept a Sunderland side up that should have stayed up. The run they just went on was a great achievement, but Bruce got Hull in to a safe position early. The job Tony Pulis has done with Crystal Palace is remarkable and he was rightly battling with Brendan Rodgers for manager of the year, but Steve Bruce should be ahead of most other candidates and if he wins the Cup final tomorrow he could well have been in for contention for manager of the year… if it hadn't already been awarded before the Cup final!
From the autumn of 2015 through the end of Donald Trump's vulgar, violence-invoking, free-speech-threatening ascent to the presidency, a broad swath of America's chattering classes and upscale college alumni consumed itself in denouncing something different. Instead of taking alarm at Trump's many breathtaking threats to quash freedoms of dissent, the chorus of conventional wisdom panicked about the “creeping totalitarianism” that former Harvard President Lawrence Summers warned was being insinuated into American life by sanctimonious liberal college students and campus elders and by recent graduates in the media and government.

It was a massive, almost desperately determined avoidance of facing what was actually threatening our freedoms.
The year-long public paroxysm over the scourge of racial and sexual political correctness was ignited in September, 2015 by "The Coddling of the American Mind," a widely read essay with a scarifying subtitle: “In the name of emotional well-being, college students are increasingly demanding protection from words and ideas they don't like. Here's why that's disastrous for education — and mental health.”
The public psychodrama climaxed 14 months later with Mark Lilla's "The End of Identity Liberalism," which blamed Trump's “repugnant” victory primarily on a condescending, censorious liberalism that privileges racial and sexual identities which many Trump supporters viewed as marginal, deviant and worse. Liberals had forced “diversity” down Americans' throats; now, "real" Americans would vomit it back out.
The “Coddling” and “Identity Liberalism” articles became book ends for what Greg Lukianoff, co-author of the former and president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education — an organization supported by right-wing funders, as I reported here — celebrated as “an epic year” for their brilliantly orchestrated crusade to blame politically correct parenting and pedagogy for asphyxiating free speech and other rights in education and, by extension, in public life. That crusade was reinforced by some breast-beating liberals, and it was hijacked by opportunists such as Trump himself.
To be sure, liberal “identity politics” has sometimes thwarted the open inquiry and expression that liberal education and democracy should defend, and it has sometimes diverted effective responses to the serious threats to freedom that are now upon us; As the author of "Liberal Racism," I've long warned against such political correctness.
But during the campus free-speech crusade's “epic year," Lukianoff and his co-author, the business psychologist Jonathan Haidt, scurried like itinerant preachers from campuses to green rooms and lecture halls across the country, brandishing First Amendment claims and professions of academic heterodoxy while casting college students and deans as the most dire threats to open inquiry and expression.

Many journalists joined the crusaders in prowling campuses with video-cams and open notebooks to construct what Yale President Peter Salovey, in an address to freshmen this September, assailed as “false narratives” about threats to freedom of speech on campuses. Although Salovey didn't mention anyone by name, he surely had in mind some of the tall tales about brave students and professors being silenced and martyred on altars of free speech by politically correct hordes.
Even as growing public awareness of murders of unarmed black men (by police, vigilantes, other black men (and, in my view, by National Rifle Association lobbyists against reasonable gun-control) spurred the Black Lives Matter movement and introduced justified racial activism into the supposed self-indulgence of campus protests, millions of Americans remained fixated on a video Lukianoff had shot of a 20-year-old black student hurling imprecations at a professor and on others' characterizations of black college students as “privileged.”
By the time Trump joined in denouncing political correctness — even while abusing his own freedoms of speech to humiliate and silence others and encouraging supporters to do likewise — the crusade against identity politics was all-too obviously diverting effective public responses from the real danger at hand.
Now the unfolding horror show of Trump's transition to the presidency is revealing political correctness to have been only one symptom, among others far more virulent, of the wide-ranging corruption of American public discourse and politics. Those who are still gloating over liberals' comeuppance and who think Trump has expanded their freedoms of speech by speaking his mind about smug liberals will soon find themselves gulping instead of speaking their own minds about, say, Trump's collaborations with cronies on Wall Street or with Vladimir Putin's authoritarian regime, or about his promised crack-downs on freedoms of the press and of speech, and his likely moves to roll back public and private-workplace rights and benefits and to abrogate judicial and congressional checks and balances.

In the cold light of 2017's dawn, the passing year's “free speech” crusade looks a lot like other paroxysms that have gripped American upper-middle classes whenever civil society has been under great stress. At such times, self-appointed keepers of conventional wisdom have ginned up public paroxysms of alarm and rage at selected internal enemies whom they blame for the crisis.
In the 1690s, it was witches, hysterical women and girls whom Puritans said had been taken by Satan. From the 1840s, it was Catholic immigrants, whom a spokesman for Republican presidential candidate James G. Blaine in 1884 said were besotted with “rum, Romanism and rebellion.” In the 1920s, it was anarchists, Reds, and unwashed immigrants, including pushy Hebrews. In the 1950s, it was American Communist spies for Stalin, the Satan of that time. In the 1960s, it was hippies and traitorous opponents of the Vietnam War. Since 2001, it has been American Muslims and, in 2003, critics of the Iraq War. And, of course, in every decade before and since, it has been feral, riotous blacks.
This sorry progression of scapegoating should have warned otherwise-intelligent people against the "free speech on campus" crusade and other recent stampedes against scapegoats. Yet many of the same pundits and propagandists who've crusaded for “free speech” this year also sneered at Ned Lamont's campaign of 2006 against Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, a champion of the Iraq War; they also lambasted the political psychologist Drew Westen for wondering, “What Happened to Obama's Passion?," in his column accusing the president, quite fairly I think, of deferring too much to government shut-down artists during the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis.

Some of the same critics disparaged Occupy Wall Street protestors who forced a public reckoning with this country's increasingly illegitimate and unsustainable inequalities. Even as these same critics bewailed political correctness this year, they found time and reasons to assail Bernie Sanders' campaign against those illegitimate inequalities.
No matter whether such spasms against internal dissent are orchestrated impulsively and demagogically or coolly and strategically, they always egg on many who are fretting that the society they've made their peace with is unravelling and who want someone “safe” to blame.
Always, these crusades also draw some support from breast-beating, finger-wagging liberals (Mark Lilla now prominent among them) who hope to stave off the worst by condemning whatever's most noxious on their own side of the spectrum. Twice this year, professors at small, leafy, upscale undergraduate residential colleges told me that political correctness is much worse than I'd reported. No doubt, they were right about their colleges. But they let their local grievances eclipse the larger dangers gathering force beyond their campus gates. And some journalists let their own ambivalences about college skew their assignations of blame.

Now, though, with Trump's inauguration impending, the conventional-wisdom keepers' “epic year” may have been their last hurrah. No longer is there much seductive, thrilling relief in assailing “cry-bullies,” teenaged “snowflakes” and “smug liberals.”
No longer can this year's paroxysm help the crusaders to shrug off their earlier paroxysms during the run-up to the Iraq War, whose opponents they harassed in 2003; or during the 2008 financial meltdown, whose most-powerful perpetrators they excused in a frenzy to blame public-sector accomplices; or the government shutdown efforts of 2011 that they contrived to blame on those like Westen who were pleading with Obama to rouse the public against a do-nothing Congress.
They won't be able to keep on blaming such scapegoats for the casino-like financing, predatory lending and intrusive, degrading consumer marketing that are really causing our crises.
"Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a'prey, when wealth accumulates and men decay,” wrote Oliver Goldsmith in 1777. “You can't build a clear conservatism out of capitalism, because capitalism disrupts culture," Sam Tanenhaus, the biographer of the conservative icon Whittaker Chambers and, soon, of William F. Buckley, told a less-than-receptive audience the conservative American Enterprise Institute in 2007.

True, today's turbo-capitalism isn't the only danger. Greed, the lust for power, tyrannical empires and technological upheavals were part of human history long before there was capitalism. One might argue that there has always been a festering hole in every civilization's soul.
But today's capital is deepening the hole because it's less entrepreneurial than it is ensnaring, trapping us like flies in a spider's web of 800-numbered, sticky-fingered pick-pocketing and surveillance machines.
Why not direct the next crusade against those creeping threats to our liberties? The dispiriting answer lies in stampedes like the one for campus "free speech" that abetted Trump's triumph instead of advancing Americans' freedoms.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- When faced with deciding between the two loves of his life, for Ben Pike, it wasn't even close. Football would not win this time.
That's how you know his love is true and strong.
When Pike's fiancee, Ashlee Barrett, learned in April 2012 she was battling leukemia, Pike began to prepare for the end of his football career at the University of Toledo. Barrett, a former Toledo basketball player, already had graduated and was back in her hometown of St. Louis, teaching second grade. Pike wanted to be with her as she navigated the long road of chemotherapy and recovery.
When Barrett, 23, learned Jan. 25 that the leukemia had returned, that the short respite of remission was over, the decision was solidified.
Pike, a Mentor High School product, has one more year of eligibility left at Toledo, one more season he could build upon what had been the best of his career as a defensive lineman in 2012. But the 22-year-old will graduate in May and take his education degree with him to St. Louis. He still plans to marry the love of his life June 15, and will be by Barrett's side each day through a bone marrow transplant and recovery from leukemia.
"I know in some people's terms, he's giving up things," said Becky Pike, Ben's mother. "But he's really not giving up. He's not giving up anything. He's really fighting for life. And he's just turned his forces to he's going to win a battle for life instead of winning on the football field."
After all, Pike and Barrett already have a love story made for a fairy tale.
The two met during Bible study meetings when Pike was a freshman and Barrett, a junior transfer from Evansville, was new to the school. Pike immediately was drawn to Barrett's infectious energy, her kindness and her blonde beauty. Barrett appreciated Pike's confidence at speaking in their meetings.
Not long after they met, Barrett learned her basketball career was over before it would even begin at Toledo because she needed a career-ending surgery. They bonded even more through Barrett's trying time.
"Through all the adversity we've been through, our relationship is greater than I ever thought it would be," Pike said. "It's pretty cool to see something incredible happen during something earth-shattering."
Soon, they began dating. In December 2011, Pike slyly buttered up some White House security to allow him to propose to Barrett on the driveway of the President's home when they were in Washington D.C., for the Rockets' appearance in the Military Bowl. They set a June 2013 wedding date.
But a few months later, Barrett began to complain of pain in her tailbone, difficulty even sitting for too long. A trip to the hospital in April 2012 uncovered a blood infection that left her septic and so close to death that Pike dropped everything he was doing, raced to the Detroit airport and flew to St. Louis.
It was then that they discovered Barrett's leukemia. When they heard the news, Barrett turned to Pike, took his hand, and said, "I'm glad it's me and not you."
"It's pretty amazing when somebody in the worst moment in their lives can be so selfless," Pike said.
He began weekly visits to St. Louis from Toledo, all through the summer, all through the 9-4 football season. The Rockets team put an "A" sticker on their helmets for Ashlee during Cancer Awareness Month in November. At the Central Michigan game, Toledo coach Matt Campbell brought her into the post-game locker room to celebrate the victory and the inspiration she provided the Rockets.
"You see Ben almost sacrifice everything and give it up for her and be by her side," Campbell said. "That was such an inspiration for us because in football and we talk winning and we're always talking about toughness. But what we learned was sacrifice. We were seeing this unfold right before our eyes.
"I think the sacrifices they were making for each other, and watching the power of Ashlee fight this with such a great attitude, was truly inspirational for each and every one of us. I think it really touched our entire football team."
By September, Barrett was finished with her chemotherapy and back to teaching. But she still was tired, and still complained of soreness. A test in January revealed that her leukemia was back.
She's back in the hospital in St. Louis, almost midway through another 40-day stay with chemotherapy. The goal is to have a bone marrow transplant sometime around April, and two matches already have been found.
She's at her weakest and lowest now, and was not available for this story. Pike is back to visiting each weekend, making time to travel after his long days of student teaching at a Toledo-area middle school. He's still on schedule to graduate in May.
"It's a very, very helpless feeling because there's nothing you can do that can make it better or go away," Pike said. "The only thing you an do is be there for her 100 percent. The whole way she's handled the first round, going through everything, the way she's handled herself with such grace and beauty and a positive outlook on life. It's been truly humbling. I can definitely say she's my hero."
Becky Pike watches how her son juggles his school schedule with his weekend visits to Barrett, and can't help but admire what she said wasn't even a dilemma for him to give up football for love.
"He just loves unconditionally," she said. "I think anyone who knows them, that would be their definition; they really just do exude from them the love of God and their love for each other. It's very humbling as a parent to watch your child display things you think you've taught.
"When you see them together, you just go, 'OK, we're going to fight this and we're going to win it.'"

State Rep. Edith Ajello (D-Providence), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, announced Wednesday she had introduced a bill to make marijuana legal for adults 21 and over and to establish a system of taxation and regulation for marijuana commerce.
“It is time for Rhode Island to put the failed policy of marijuana prohibition behind us and adopt a more sensible approach just as our nation did with alcohol 80 years ago,” Ajello said. “By keeping marijuana sales in the underground market, we are ensuring they will be uncontrolled and that those selling it is not asking for proof of age. Regulating marijuana like alcohol will take marijuana sales off the street and put them in the hands of legitimate businesses that would face real disincentives for selling to minors. These new businesses will also create jobs and generate much-needed new tax revenue.”
Her bill, House Bill 5274, the Marijuana Regulation, Control and Taxation Act, would:
remove criminal penalties for the private possession of up to one ounce of marijuana and for the home-growing of up to three mature marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked space;
establish a tightly regulated system of licensed marijuana retail stores, cultivation facilities, and testing facilities;
enact an excise tax of up to $50 per ounce on the wholesale sale of marijuana applied at the point of transfer from the cultivation facility to a retail store (sales tax will also be applied at the point of retail sales); and
require the Department of Business Regulation to establish rules regulating security, labeling, health and safety requirements, as well as rules requiring advertising of marijuana to be no less restrictive than advertising of tobacco.
The bill has the support of both local and national marijuana reform groups.
“As a public health researcher, I know that regulation works,” said Michelle McKenzie, a spokesperson for the statewide Coalition for Marijuana Regulation. “Over the past 20 years, we have reduced levels of teen cigarette use by nearly 50%, and we have done it through enacting strict regulations and providing comprehensive, evidence-based public education. We can do the same thing when it comes to marijuana. I am confident that regulating marijuana will make Rhode Island a safer and healthier place to live.”
“State and federal lawmakers from around the nation are bringing forward proposals to regulate marijuana like alcohol, and they are being met with more public support than ever before,” said Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project. “Most Americans are fed up with laws that punish adults simply for using a product that is objectively less harmful than alcohol. The bill introduced today in Rhode Island presents a smarter, more responsible approach to marijuana.”
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample The bill has been referred to the House Finance Committee. Rhode Island is the fourth state to see marijuana legalization legislation filed this year. The others are Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Similar bills are expected to be filed in Maine, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.

In genetics, it's not just the living who advance the field: DNA preserved in the brittle bones of our ancestors can provide significant insight into our genetic history. Such is the case with a new genetic history of Europe, traced by an international team of researchers and published today in Science. By creating a seamless genetic map from 7,500 to 3,500 years ago in one geographic region, scientists discovered that the genetic diversity of modern day Europe can't be explained by a single migration, as previously thought, but by multiple migrations coming from a range of areas in modern day Europe.
To write the genetic history of Europe is to glance into the evolution of a Western culture and, often, to be greeted with more questions than answers: Why do 45 percent of Europeans share a distinct kind mitochondrial DNA (DNA passed down through the maternal line) known as haplogroup H? What causes one type of mitochondrial DNA to become dominant over another kind? Can changes in an archaeological record mirror changes in a genetic record?
The new genetic history might provide some answers to these questions. To attempt to piece together Europe's vast genetic history, researchers from the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) at the University of Adelaide, the University of Mainz, the State Heritage Museum in Halle (Germany), and National Geographic Society's Genographic Project extracted mitochondrial DNA from the teeth and bones of 396 prehistoric skeletons. These skeletons were found in a rather small and confined area within the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, an area which in previous studies had proved to hold a number of usable skeletal samples.
“We collected over 400 samples from skeletal individuals and extracted DNA. And for 396 of them, we got unambiguous results that could be confirmed,” says Dr. Wolfgang Haak of ACAD, a lead author of the study. “DNA is not preserved in all individuals, so that was a fantastic success rate.”
The study included a wealth of data not seen before–ten times as much mitochondrial DNA was examined as in previous studies, making it the largest examination of ancient DNA to date. Such a large amount of data allowed the researchers to create a “a gapless record…from the earliest farmers to the early Bronze Age,” says Haak in a press statement.
One of the ways researchers were able to piece together this gapless genetic record was by narrowing their skeletal samples to a single region. The region in Saxony-Anhalt is especially fruitful when it comes to ancient skeletal samples due to recent political history: after the Berlin Wall was torn down, part of former East Germany underwent a tremendous amount of infrastructural revitalization. In the process of digging new roads and motorways, a number of ancient skeletons were uncovered, boosting the archeological record so much that researchers have access to a sample of specimens ranging from 7,500 years ago to present-day. Moreover, by confining their search within distinct geographic parameters, the researchers were able to construct a real transect of what happened through time in a specific place, instead of a “patchy record of here and there,” as Haak describes the alternative.
What they found surprised them. In an earlier study, Haak and his colleagues used ancient DNA to show that lifestyles in Central Europe switched from hunting and gathering to farming around 5,500 BCE soon after a wave of migration from the Near East, evidenced by a visible change in the genetic makeup when farming enters the archeological record. But the genetic diversity of modern Europe is too complex to be explained by this migration event alone.
The conundrum that left Haak and researchers puzzled–until now. By taking samples from specimens that create a complete timeline in Saxony-Anhalt, the researchers could pinpoint when changes within the mitochondrial DNA occurred. Confirming their past finding, they saw that while the DNA patterns changed with the influx of farming, they also changed thousands of years later.
By comparing the timing of these genetic changes with a timeline of archaeological finds in central Europe, and by looking up the cultural origins of new artifacts that pop up in the timeline when these genetic changes happened, researchers suggest that the genetic history of Europeans was not only affected by a migration of farmers from the Near East, but by subsequent migrations from cultures in to the west (what is now the Iberian Peninsula) and east (what is now Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and other modern Eastern European countries).
“With this genetic timeline, we can confirm that the first genetic change occurred between hunter-gatherers and farmers, and it's surprisingly stable for about two thousand years, when farming is completely established,” Haak explains. “Then, towards the end of the Neolithic, we gain a bit of momentum and see a bunch of early hunter-gatherer lineages coming back. And then again, shortly after that, we see new impulses, coming both from the East and the West. There are suddenly these additionally elements that make-up most of the modern-day diversity. By the time that we reach the early Bronze Age, we have mostly everything in place that we see today.”
The authors' hypotheses on where these waves of migrations came from relies on the idea that new cultural artifacts, if found in a specific region, must have been brought by travelers far away. But new tools and artifacts, by themselves, don't automatically mean that migrations have happened to freshen the gene pool: as Haak notes, just because one uses an iPod does not make one distinctly American, or European, or anything else. Nonetheless it seems that, at least in ancient times, new tools and technologies might have gone hand in hand with genetic influxes as migrants brought old techniques to their new lands.
A Jewish family from the Paris area has their dog to thank for their escape from a fire that they believe may have been started outside their home by an Islamist neighbor, an anti-racism group said.
The family was awakened after midnight on Friday night by the dog's insistent barking to discover that their front door was on fire, with smoke rapidly filling up the interior of their apartment in the southeastern suburb of Creteil, the National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism, or BNVCA, reported Sunday.
The door had been set on fire by individuals who doused it with a highly flammable fluid, police concluded, according to the case report of the BNVCA. The family told police that they suspected a neighbor, who is an Arab, and whom BNVCA said has expressed extremist and anti-Semitic views online. Police detained the neighbor in connection with the incident, which BNVCA is calling anti-Semitic.

Last week, an unidentified person set the family's car on fire. Witnesses saw a man wearing a hoodie set it alight, according to the BNVCA report.
“The incident confirms BNVCA's observation that anti-Semitic acts that began as targeting property belonging to Jews (synagogues, schools, community centers) or as assaults on people on the street have evolved into attacks on Jews inside their own homes,” the group wrote.
In 2014, Creteil saw an anti-Semitic incident that horrified many French Jews, in which three men broke into a Jewish family's home because they assumed they would have money due to their ethnicity. Encountering a young couple inside the home, one-armed suspect guarded the woman's boyfriend and another took his credit card to a cash machine while a third raped the woman. The victims said the assailants hurled anti-Semitic insults at them.
Occurring amid a major increase in anti-Semitic violence in France accompanying Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that year, the incident echoed for many the traumatic murder and torture in 2006 of Ilan Halimi, a Jewish phone salesman who was abducted by a gang led by a career criminal with a history of targeting mostly Jewish victims.
Earlier this year, Sarah Halimi, a physician and kindergarten, was murdered inside her home by an Islamist neighbor whom prosecutors say was motivated by anti-Semitic hatred. She was not a relative of Ilan Halimi.
Some French Jews regard the murder of Ilan Halimi as the turning point in the emergence of an unprecedented wave of violence against Jews in France and Belgium, where more than 12 people have died since 2012 in at least three jihadist attacks on Jewish targets.
The first step in Jewel v. NSA is for the court to decide whether to adopt or reject the government's invocation of the controversial 'state secrets' privilege—a legal tool that started as a limited shield intended to protect legitimate and critical government national security secrets, but which the government has attempted to turn into a sword to block Americans seeking to enforce the law and the Constitution.
Essentially, by invoking the state secrets privilege in this way, the government argues that even if all of the allegations of serious law-breaking and Constitutional violations are true, surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans is exempt from judicial review.
In response to the government's assertion, and as it has since the first wiretapping cases started in 2006, EFF argues that in creating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress preempted the state secrets privilege, creating a separate but still very secure way for the case to be decided. The FISA law not only prevents the immediate dismissal of the case, it affirmatively instructs courts to determine whether electronic surveillance is legal.
In July 2013, the court rejected the government's “state secrets” argument, ruling that any properly classified details can be litigated under the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). It is unclear whether the government will appeal.
What is the State Secrets Privilege
The Supreme Court recognized the ‘state secrets' privilege in the 1953 case United States v. Reynolds. The 1953 privilege was much more limited than how the government interprets it today.
Invoking the Privilege: As the Supreme Court said at the time, it can only be invoked where “‘there is a reasonable danger' that disclosure [of evidence] will ‘expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.' The invocation must come from “the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration of that office.”
Impact of the Privilege: Under Reynolds, the government could exempt individual pieces of evidence from discovery—evidence that only the government possessed—if their release would harm national security. The case could still go forward with other evidence. The Supreme Court recently confirmed this interpretation, saying “The privileged information is excluded and the trial goes on without it.”
Critically, the privilege could not exempt underlying facts from judicial review if plaintiffs had the same evidence from another source.
State Secrets Privilege Expansion After 9/11
But since 9/11, first the Bush and then the Obama Administration have aggressively used the ‘state secrets' privilege, insisting that entire cases could be exempt from judicial review at the outset if they touch on national security. They seek to use the narrow, evidentiary scalpel like a chainsaw, to deny justice for millions of ordinary Americans for rampant violations of their rights.
The Administrations have even argued that cases must be dismissed entirely even when all the underlying facts are already public, if the judge's conclusion about these facts would confirm the allegations.
Under this theory, the government could potentially violate the law and Constitution as it sees fit, and—just by stamping “STATE SECRET” on the top of their actions—those injured by their actions would be denied justice. A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel once described the argument as such:
At base, the government argues here that state secrets form the subject matter of a lawsuit, and therefore require dismissal, any time a complaint contains allegations, the truth or falsity of which has been classified as secret by a government official…According to the government's theory, the Judiciary should effectively cordon off all secret government actions from judicial scrutiny, immunizing the CIA and its partners from the demands and limits of the law.”
A notable series of cases during the Bush years were brought by the ACLU and involved serious and disturbing allegations of torture, supported by hundreds of pages of public evidence. According to the government, it did not matter if the information the considered “secret” had already appeared on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post, or been officially investigated and admitted to by official European government commissions. The government argued that they not only had complete control of their own documents, but the facts underlying them.
ACLU's Ben Wizner said at the time that if the government's argument was accepted, “The only place in the world where these claims can't be discussed is in the courtroom.”
In FISA, Congress Preempted the State Secrets Privilege
In Jewel v. NSA, EFF also has thousands of pages of already-public evidence—including an AT&T whistleblower, three NSA whistleblowers, Congressional testimony, Inspector General reports and investigations from virtually every major news agency. We are asking the court to allow the case to go forward and hear the evidence. But unlike the other post-9/11 state secrets cases, in Jewel we have an additional tool: FISA, the law that governs national electronic surveillance cases expressly supersedes the state secrets privilege.
As a result of another domestic spying scandal, Congress created clear legal claims in FISA to allow those impacted by electronic surveillance to sue in court. Congress also provided explicit instructions, similar to those used in cases against accused terrorists, providing how to litigate these issues even if they involve national security secrets. In one key section (1806(f)), the law says:
Whenever any motion or request is made by an aggrieved person...the United States District Court shall,...notwithstanding any other law...review in camera and ex party the applications, order and such other materials relating to the surveillance as may be necessary to determine whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted.
The statute not only requires the court let the case go forward on our public evidence, it also provides strong tools for the government to protect any sensitive evidence that the government needs to use to make its case but which cannot be made public, while still allowing a judicial determination.
The ultimate lesson here is that secrecy is not an immunity trump card and no government agency should be above the law. There is no better example of this than the original state secrets case, US v. Reynolds. The government, at the time, claimed the evidence it was withholding would reveal critical national security secrets and the Court agreed. But in 2000, when the documents at issue were finally declassified, they contained no secrets at all. The only thing the documents contained was evidence of government negligence—which would have validated the plaintiff's case.
Risoni with homemade cheese, Caribbean style tempeh and Tonkatsu seitan
(For english see below!)
En unik helt vegansk restaurang och bar kan snart vara en verklighet i Göteborg!
Vår vision är en restaurang med tilltalande, rustik veganmat av bra kvalitet och med en blandning av internationella och svenska rätter. Alltid vällagat, fräscht och smakrikt. Vi jobbar med såväl grönsaker som seitan, tofu och tempeh. För den fikasugne vill vi erbjuda flertalet goda mackor, bakverk, desserter, milkshakes, juicer och så klart kaffe och te. Söndagar viger vi helhjärtat åt en brunchbuffé.
Vår bar kommer att vara en avslappnad och mysig mötesplats för människor med ett genuint musikintresse. Ett hak dit alla är välkomna för att lyssna på musik, hänga med bra folk, prova något från vår barmeny och dricka allt från en stor stark till en vegansk white russian. Helt enkelt ett ställe vi själva skulle vilja gå till. (Här har vi samlat inspirationsbilder för hur det skulle kunna se ut på restaurangen)
Sundays will be dedicated to a brunch buffet
Vi behöver din hjälp!
När vi offentliggjorde vår plan att starta Göteborgs kanske bästa veganska restaurang och bar fick vi snabbt 2000 gillare på vår facebooksida, och nu någon månad senare närmar vi oss 3000, utan att vi ens finns på riktigt än.
Vår planering och våra förberedelser inför öppnandet av restaurangen går säkert framåt, ibland långsamt och ibland väldigt snabbt.
Det vi saknar nu är din hjälp!
Målet med denna kampanj är att få in minst 125 000 kronor. Vi har pengar sparade till en billigare lokal, men för att kunna starta behöver vi också kunna göra inköp, rusta upp lokalen och sätta vår prägel på stället samt köpa in en del maskiner och annan utrustning som saknas. Allt detta kostar så vi är evigt tacksamma för ditt bidrag. Som tack har vi flera olika belöningar du får ta del av.
Stretchgoal
Att få in 200 000 kronor skulle ge oss möjlighet att vidareutveckla, förbättra och underlätta vår produktion av bland annat seitanprodukter och hemmagjord tempeh. Vi har en önskan om att både använda dessa produkter i restaurangköket och att sälja direkt till Er, våra kunder.
Homemade Tempehburgers, Tofu-Feta cheese, Seitan Sasages and Ham
Vadå vegan?
Vår restaurang kommer enbart att servera helt vegansk mat. Köttprodukter, mejeriprodukter och andra produkter som kommer från djur är bannlysta från vårt kök. Istället omfamnar vi fantastiska grönsaker, frukter, nötter, frön, baljväxter och produkter gjorda av dessa i olika former.
Veganpolicyn gäller självklart även baren och drycker vi säljer. Vi undersöker allt och ser till att tillverkaren ger oss svar på att innehåll och tillverkningsprocesser är fria från animalier.
Cashewmozzarella
Och varför?
Enkelt uttryckt; av respekt, medkänsla och omtanke om djuren och djurens rättigheter.
Bara i Sverige dödas 85 miljoner djur i kött-, mjölk- & äggindustrin samt 19 miljarder fiskar, fastän ingen vill dö för att hamna på en tallrik. Djur är liksom du och jag unika individer, som kan känna smärta, lidande och välmående. Att utnyttjas av människor och spärras in i små bås och burar, avlas så de blir sjuka, tvångsinsemineras och dödas ligger inte i djurens eget intresse. Djuren har rätt till sina egna kroppar och sina egna liv.
Vi väljer bort djurförtrycket - och det kan du också göra!
Bakgrund
Det här är något vi drömt om i flera år och vi vet att vi är många som har saknat ett sådant koncept i Göteborg.
Vår samlade erfarenhet av restaurangbranschen, veganmatlagning och musik är stor. Vi är professionella kockar och hemmakockar, dj´s, musiker, veganambassadörer och politiskt intresserade av djurrätt och sociala frågor.
Vi har lagat mat tillsammans och med andra grupper i djurrättssammanhang, på spelningar och festivaler. På CV:et står bland annat julbord, Punk illegal festivalen, bröllopsfester, Veganias kokbok och hemsida, Tigerharens tio-årsjubileum, folkkök i mängder, Olik, Köksbrigaden och Grönsaksfonden samt professionellt på Hagabion (Gbg), Hermans (Sthlm), cateringkök (Malmö och London), Ellös bageri och Food for friends (Brighton).
I musik och barsammanhang har du sett oss i Agrimonia, Contorture, Insidious process, som aktiva i Punk illegal, Truckstop Alaska, SPATT, Gothenburg Hardcore och Crew Scumrask, samt i dj-båset.

A new unique vegan restaurant and bar might soon see the light in Göteborg.
The vision for our restaurant is to serve appealing and rustic vegan food made of fine quality ingredients. A mix of international and Swedish dishes, always cooked well, fresh and with a lot of flavors. We will work with a mix of vegetables, seitan, tofu and tempeh. For the sweet tooth we will offer a mix of pastries, desserts, milkshakes, juices and of course coffee and tea. Sundays will be dedicated to a brunch buffet.
Our bar will be a relaxed and cosy meeting spot for people with a genuine interest in music. A place where everyone is welcome to come hangout, listen to music, try a snack from our bar menu and have a beer, vegan cocktail, wine or other delicious options from our bar. In other words, our own dream bar. (Here we have some ideas for how we want the bar to look like)
Argentinian-Inspired Seitan Beef with Chimichurri
We need your help!
When our plans, to start what might become the best vegan restaurant and bar in Gothenburg, went public we soon got 2000 likes on our facebook page, and a few months later we are close to 3000 likes. And that for a not yet existing company. We are working hard on the preparations for opening the restaurant but now we need your help.
Our goal for this campaign is to raise 125 000 Swedish kronor. We have got money to buy a smaller place, but to be able to start a business we also need money for groceries, renovations, decorations and to buy equipment and kitchen appliances. We are very grateful for whatever you can give. Our nice rewards are our "thankyou's".
Stretchgoal
Raising 200 000 kronor would give us the opportunity to expand and improve our production of homemade seitan products and tempeh. Our goal is to use these products in the restaurant and also sell directly to our customers.
Chili cheese
Vegan?
In our restaurant we will only serve vegan food. Meat, dairy and other products with animal origin are banned from our kitchen. Instead we embrace amazing vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, beans and products made thereof.
The vegan policy of course also applies on the bar and the drinks we sell. We will contact the manufacturers to make sure that the content and production are free from animal products.
And why?
Simply; by respect and compassion for animals and animal rights.
Billions of animals are being killed in the industry for making meat, milk and eggs. Others are being hunted down and the amount of fish being killed is enormous. Even though no one wants do die and end up on a plate. Animals, like you and me, are unique individuals, who can feel pain, suffering and joy. Being used by humans; caged in small spaces, bred so they get ill, inseminated by force and then being killed, is not in the interest of the animal. All animals have the right to their own bodies and their own lives.
We choose compassion and take no part in animal cruelty - and you can too!

Background
For years we have been dreaming of this and we know that this concept is missing in Gothenburg. We have lots of experience in the restaurant business, vegan cooking and music. We are professional chefs and home cooks, dj's, musicians, vegan ambassadors and we have a great interest in animal rights and social issues. Our CV contains Christmas foodparties, Punk illegal festival, wedding catering, Vegania cookbook and webpage, the 10 year anniversary of Tigerharen (animal shelter organization), people's kitchen, Olik (pop up restaurant project), Köksbrigaden and Grönsaksfonden plus as professional chefs at Hagabion (Gothenburg), Hermans (Stockholm), catering (Malmö and London), Ellös bakery and Food for friends (Brighton). Music wise you might have seen us in Agrimonia, Contorture, Insidious process, as parts of Punk illegal, Truckstop Alaska, SPATT, Gothenburg Hardcore and Crew Scumrask plus as DJ's.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said on Wednesday that he's "not concerned about the very poor," citing the social safety net in place for that segment of the populace and adding that he's focused on the middle class.
"I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it," the Republican front-runner said Wednesday on CNN, following his victory in the Florida primary. "I'm not concerned about the very rich, they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of the America, the 90 percent, 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling."
CNN's Soledad O'Brien pressed him on his comments, adding that they may sound odd for Americans who are very poor.
"Well you had to finish the sentence, Soledad," he replied. "I said 'I'm not concerned about the very poor that have a safety net but if it has holes in it, I will repair them.' The challenge right now -- we will hear from the Democrat party the plight of the poor. And there's no question it's not good being poor and we have a safety net to help those that are very poor. But my campaign is focused on middle-income Americans."
"We have a very ample safety net," said Romney. "And we can talk about whether it needs to be strengthened or whether there are holes in it. But we have food stamps, we have Medicaid, we have housing vouchers, we have programs to help the poor."
Programs in the "safety net" are also suffering during the economic recession. Medicaid, for example faces cuts as states attempt to balance budgets at a time when more people are using the program. GOP lawmakers have also eyed cuts in food stamps as food prices rise, even though more Americans are using the the program as a consequence of the economic recession.
Romney's policies call for cutting federal spending and reconfiguring the social safety net. He calls for an immediate five-percent cut to non-discretionary spending, which would hit the safety net hard. He proposes turning Medicaid into a block grant program and undertaking a "fundamental restructuring of government programs and services." He also calls for capping spending at 20 percent of GDP -- a significant cut -- and adds that he "will pursue further cuts" as spending comes "under control."
Romney's statement is part of a pattern of previously poorly phrased remarks that give his competitors fodder to call the former Bain Capital founder -- who is worth between $190 million and $250 million -- out of touch with the economic recession.
"Don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom," he said last October in Las Vegas, the hardest-hit metro area by the foreclosure crisis.
In January, Romney said, "I like being able to fire people who provide services to me" to explain why he favored competition among health insurers. "If someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I want to say I am going to get somebody else to provide that service to me."
We have seen the enemy and he is us.
‘He,' in this case, is those among us now fighting an all-out war against government programs aimed at reducing the damage caused by human-forced climate change. And in this present time of ramping climate catastrophe, there is no excuse at all for this morally reprehensible activity. Yet, excuse or no, the foul actions of these shameless ignoramuses continue. For all around the world conservatives (called [neo] liberals in Australia) with ties to fossil fuel based industry continue to scuttle programs that would result in the more rapid adoption of renewable energy systems even as they undermine related initiatives to increase energy efficiency.
At a time when the world faces down a growing climate crisis — one that will have dramatically worsening impacts as the decades progress — these failed and corruption-born policies represent the most abhorrent of political activities. And as the world convenes to consider how best to lessen the danger posed by an unfolding global tragedy, there are many in power who are now actively working to increase that danger.
More than anything else, this corrupt group is fighting to enforce ramping dangers, an ever-broadening harm, and untold future tragedy.
Shutting Down Coal to Build Natural Gas in The UK
This week, the conservative government of the United Kingdom made what seemed to be an optimistic announcement. It now plans to phase out all coal generation by 2025. Because coal power generation is the worst of the worst among carbon polluters, this news was rather good. Good, that is, when one doesn't take a look at the broader context of current UK energy policy. And taking that look, we find what could best be described as an utterly abysmal state of affairs.
(Wind power, produced by these and many other majestic towers turning over the UK countryside, is a critical solution to human-based fossil fuel emissions and a target of conservative energy policies. Image source: British Wind Energy Association.)
Ever since coming to power this summer, the conservative government has consistently cut subsidies for renewable energy while providing subsidies for some of the worst polluting facilities imaginable. Recently, UK Energy Secretary Rudd received stark criticism for this move along with pointed words over related backward policies like the provision of subsidies for expensive and polluting diesel-electric generators. Pointed words that came from both politicians and scientists alike. One such scientist was chief of the UN's environmental programme Jacqueline McGlade who recently stated in the Financial Times:
“What's disappointing is when we see countries such as the United Kingdom that have really been in the lead in terms of getting their renewable energy up and going — we see subsidies being withdrawn and the fossil fuel industry being enhanced.”
So even as conservatives in the UK are phasing out coal, they are replacing it with oil and natural gas. Fossil fuel replacements for fossil fuels at the expense of both zero-carbon renewables and a climate capable of supporting human civilization. For both oil and gas are still major carbon emitters. Especially when one considers the UK conservatives' intention of fracking the countryside in search of these dangerous fuels. A method of extraction that has proven to increase emissions of volatile methane gas. And each new gas or oil plant built will continue to pump carbon into the atmosphere for decades even as it risks having its production lifespan cut short as the damages caused by carbon pollution become ever more obvious.
From the Financial Times:
Ms Rudd told the Today programme she wanted to rewrite the rules of the scheme to encourage gas instead. She said: “We have a capacity market auction coming up. We are going to review it carefully afterwards and ensure we do get the new gas we need.”
Conservatives, in this case, who have ideologically (and ludicrously) campaigned against all subsidies have instead decided to subsidize the bad climate outcomes all while cutting funding for solutions.
Fighting Renewable Energy Subsidies, Clean Power Plan in the US
In the US, the situation is only slightly better. Slightly better in that conservatives do not currently hold the Presidency. That said, conservatives are still doing their damnedest to kill off practically every renewable energy program the United States has to offer.
In May, House Republicans presented a bill (HR 1901) that would completely kill off the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy in the US. This in contrast to a permanent wind Production Tax Credit proposed by Obama. Meanwhile, the same Republican clowns who bring snowballs into the halls of Congress as supposed proof that global warming isn't happening repeatedly try to de-fund the PTC for both wind and solar at each and every new budget session.
And it's primarily due these efforts on behalf of fossil fuel backers by Republicans that the PTC is set to expire again by 2017. A move that will inject volatility into the renewable energy markets and bite into what has been an amazing period of growth by both Wind and Solar energy across the US. Growth that has happened despite Republicans' apparent best efforts to halt it (see Paul Krugman's Enemies of the Sun).
(US Solar energy adoption rates continued to soar in 2015, jumping to 40 percent of all new installed energy capacity for the first half of the year. These great gains have occurred despite broad based assaults on public policies supporting the rapid adoption of this critical renewable energy source. Image source: US Solar Market Summary.)
Though the PTC represents the Federal Government's big support program for wind and solar energy development, any program that would reduce carbon emissions falls under attack. Republicans, who have hypocritically spoken in favor of US energy independence, mount repeated attacks on increases in Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standards. Republicans incessantly assault the EPA and its underlying Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. But more recently, Republican attacks against EPA have focused on the underpinnings of Obama's Clean Power Plan. The plan, which sets modest goals to reduce US carbon emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels through 2030, would also greatly increase the rate of US renewable energy adoption, force the early retirement of the worst polluting power plants, and push for further increases in energy efficiency. Exactly the kind of progress against human forced climate change and toward US energy independence that Republicans apparently abhor.
By contrast, there hasn't been a bit of legislation supporting fossil fuels that Republicans haven't loved. Republicans constantly call for ending the oil export ban — a move that would greatly benefit US-based oil corporations. They wholeheartedly support the polluting and groundwater destroying process that is fracking. They've repeatedly called for increased drilling of all kinds everywhere including offshore drilling, Alaska National Wildlife Refuge Drilling, and Arctic Ocean Drilling. And they continuously support the dirtiest, highest carbon emitting fuel sources imaginable such as Canada's Tar Sands and Coal. In fact, Republicans support for coal extends to the point that they frequently pass bills like this one which would allow toxic fly ash to enter groundwater supplies.
At the State level conservative republicans have repeatedly attempted to ram through ALEC and Koch funded bills to roll back net metering laws and renewable energy targets (see Koch Brothers, Big Utilities Attack Solar Energy). All while attempting to open public lands and waters to every variety of drilling and coal mining.
But despite these broad based attacks, renewable energy in the United States continues to make major gains even as energy efficiency measures advance. Sadly, the pace of carbon emission reduction and related renewable energy adoption has been greatly slowed by these continuous attacks by conservative Republicans.
Australia — From Terrible to Not Much Better
In the Southern Hemisphere, recent years have seen a wholesale gutting of renewable energy based policies by the Tony Abbott government in Australia. Time and time again, Abbott (which like northern conservatives foists laizzez faire markets and supports destructive industries like fossil fuels) pushed for a roll back in Australia's previously aggressive renewable energy adoption rate all while trying to breathe new life into a zombie coal mining, export and power industry.
By Summer of 2015 the situation had gotten so dire that solar energy industry leaders were calling Abbott's actions a ‘vindictive crusade' against the renewable energy industry. John Grimes, head of the Australian Solar Council, this July launched an attack on the Abbott government after Australia's Clean Energy Finance Corporation decided to stop funding new wind projects.
In a statement to the Saturday Paper, Grimes asserted:
“If Abbott continues this way, we're [the solar industry] finished. We know that solar and other renewables are competing with coal, and Abbott is intent upon protecting that industry. So, this is our WorkChoices moment. We will be mobilising, and we'll be campaigning in marginal seats. We're starting to plan this now.”
(During June of 2015, the Tony Abbott government cut Australia's Renewable Energy Target [RET] from 41 gigawatts by 2020 to 33 gigawatts. Unfortunately, the new Prime Minister — Malcolm Turnbull — hasn't moved to support previous, more aggressive targets. As such, Tony Abbott's legacy of cutting renewable energy in favor of coal lives on. Image source: Renew Economy.)
By Fall, the Abbott government had fractured. This development likely in no small part due to campaigning by renewable energy supporters and those concerned about human caused climate change. The new head of the Australian Liberal Party (don't let the name fool you, they're just like conservatives everywhere else) Malcolm Turnbull, when considering past performance, might want to support cutting edge solar technology for Australia. However, in his first months as Prime Minister he appears to have done little but cowtow to his numerous coal industry supporting party colleagues.
As an example, Turnbull's appointed Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel recently stated:
“My vision is for a country, a society, or world, where we don't use any coal, oil, or natural gas, because we have zero-emissions electricity in huge abundance”.
But Turnbull, who is now being pushed by his political colleagues to make it illegal for environmentalists to sue coal companies if they open up new land to mining, felt the need to defend coal on the same stage by making the following and highly fallacious statement:
“If Australia were to stop all of its coal exports … it would not reduce global emissions one iota.”
Due to renewable energy's popularity in Australia, due to Turnbull's own likely affinity for the development of cutting edge wind and solar ventures, but also due to the terrible and intransigent institutional legacy of coal support in his party, the Turnbull government has come across as schizophrenic on the issues of renewable energy and climate change. On the one hand, some within Turnbull's administration make statements like that of Dr. Finkel above. But when it comes to actual policy, Turnbull has continued to support many of the disastrous initiatives set forward by Tony Abbott. Which makes the Turnbull government look like it's attempting to greenwash a facade over a rather ugly coal-ash face.
If Leaders Can't Support Renewable Energy and Work to Halt Fossil Fuel Burning, Then They Need To Go
Though the UK, the US and Australia do not make up the entirety of the western world, the conservative anti-renewable energy and pro-fossil fuel sentiment represented in these three countries is wide-ranging. Such sentiment is common to conservative governing groups around the world — from Canada to Europe to New Zealand and beyond. In the western democracies of the world this crippling ideology is preventing a necessarily rapid push to adopt non-carbon energy and prevent the worst impacts of global climate change.
As we approach the Paris Climate Summit, we should be very clear on this one political issue of key importance. If these people continue to hold political power, we will not act rapidly or decisively enough. We will find ourselves overwhelmed by consequences as their delaying actions stymie any effective response. It is therefore crucial that the supporters of the fossil fuel industries of the world are removed from office. They have shown themselves for their true colors — they'll continue to support these harmful and wretched fuels regardless of consequences, regardless of any, even the most extreme, risks to their own nations and to the nations of the world.

In regards to drivers and BIOS updates on workstations in your environment, a lot of organizations have held the mindset for many years that ‘If it ain't broke, don't fix it!‘. We did too up until we had a Windows Desktop RaaS with Microsoft in 2014.
Blog info: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2014/02/10/rap-as-a-service-raas-from-microsoft-services-premier-support/
Premier Services site: https://services.premier.microsoft.com/assess?
What we found is that by not managing our driver and BIOS versions, we had no baseline, and there for a very difficult time troubleshooting hardware and performance related issues. Now we inventory our driver information in SCCM, and can report on how we are doing with versions out in our environment. This information is not available out of the box, so it takes a little setup.
Inventoring the Win32_PnpSignedDriver WMI class
This class cannot be inventoried directly, so a custom WMI class must be created and populated
This has been tried before, and not many had luck http://www.systemcentercentral.com/forums-archive/topic/win32_pnpsigneddriver-inventory/ https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/configmgr_geek_speak/2013/11/10/inventorying-and-reporting-network-adapter-driver-details-and-how-to-report-only-the-wireless-type-with-bonus-mini-primer-on-sql-report-builder-in-configuration-manager-2012/ http://www.myitforum.com/forums/SMS-MOF-file-for-Win32_PnPSignedDriver-m178956.aspx https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/systemcenter/en-US/20e7e3f7-31c0-48f5-9d99-5d2b215bb218/win32pnpsigneddriver-diles-to-add-to-smsdefmof?forum=configmgrgeneral

The SQL view v_gs_pnp_signed_driver_custom gets created from your hardware inventory and contains all the raw data. Here are a few sample SQL queries:

We use the two LAN and WLAN queries above to create a network driver dashboard to report on how standardized we are. We highlight the current standard versions to quickly see any drift.
The .RDL is tailored for our environment, primarily Intel NICs with a few Broadcom and Realtek, so you may need to customize it for your models. The highlights also are “point in time” choices, and will also need to be modified for your needs.

Like virtually every other traditional news entity, the Associated Press newswire has been under pressure for some time from digital media. But this disruption has been even worse for AP and its ilk because they are primarily distributors, and the web has fundamentally democratized content distribution. Instead of trying to find ways to adapt to this new reality, however, the AP seems determined to fight it with everything it has, including lawsuits: On Tuesday, the service launched a lawsuit in New York against a digital news-aggregation service called Meltwater, accusing the service of copyright infringement and “free riding” on its content. The AP says it isn't going after news aggregators as a whole, but this is clearly meant as a show of force.

Meltwater — which was founded in Oslo, Norway, in 2001 — provides an electronic version of the old-style news clipping services that companies used to use as a way of keeping up on what was being said about them or their products in the media. Instead of a pile of clipped articles from printed newspapers and magazines, Meltwater gives company executives an electronic news-filtering service in return for monthly subscription fees, which summarizes content not just from the AP but from hundreds of other public sources. But that is not the way the Associated Press sees it. According to a statement from CEO Tom Curley, it is a parasite that leeches off the newswire's content illegally:
Meltwater News is a parasitic distribution service that competes directly with traditional news sources without paying license fees to cover the costs of creating those stories. It has a significant negative impact on the ability of AP to continue providing the high-quality news reports on which the public relies.
The AP is determined to fight rather than adapt
It is interesting that Curley's argument seems to rest in part on the idea that the Associated Press is providing some kind of public service that is important to democracy, etc. when in reality, the newswire is simply a content-distribution service that is owned by its member newspapers (and produces some of its own content as well). As media theorist Clay Shirky noted in an essay in 2010, this kind of distribution function seems woefully inadequate and possibly even unnecessary in the age of the web. “Syndication makes little sense in a world with URLs,” as Shirky described it.
The AP seems determined to fight this reality, however, and to do whatever it can to maintain control over its content and the scarcity that is at the core of its business model — just as newspaper owners like Rupert Murdoch (s nws) are trying to do with paywalls and other gates around their information. In addition to trying to compel companies like Meltwater to pay licensing fees for using its content (as it has with Google News and others), it is trying hard to keep its journalists from reporting news on Twitter, just as Sky News and other traditional providers are.
The Associated Press says that it isn't planning to go after news aggregators as a whole and that it isn't against services or sites that provide headlines and links to AP content. General counsel Laura Malone said in the statement issued by the newswire that Meltwater “is not a typical news aggregator” because it is a closed system that subscribers must pay a fee to access — and therefore not “public” in the sense that Google News is — and that the Norwegian company also provides “lengthier and more systematic excerpts” from AP articles (it also maintains archives of past AP content, the newswire complaint alleges).
To the AP, every news aggregator is a potential threat
When you combine this latest lawsuit with the fact that the AP has forced Google News (s goog) and others to license its content, however — even just to provide an excerpt of a few sentences and a headline — it seems fairly obvious that the newswire either wants aggregators to pay for the right to use any of its content or they will face a lawsuit. And as Jeff Roberts of our sister site paidContent points out, the Meltwater case is actually a throwback to a landmark case from 1918, when the Associated Press won what the courts called a “hot news misappropriation” case against a now-defunct competitor that was “free riding” on the AP's business model. The AP statement against Meltwater makes the connection explicit:
Meltwater free-rides on AP's significant investments in gathering and reporting news. In short, Meltwater earns substantial fees for redistributing premium news content, while bearing none of the costs associated with creating that content.
The Associated Press may be trying to create the impression that its dispute with Meltwater is a special case and doesn't apply to other news aggregators, but its argument about excerpting and free riding could just as easily apply to any site or service that bundles headlines and links — or potentially even to sites like the Huffington Post (s aol), which has been widely criticized by traditional media outlets for “over-aggregation” of their stories. And the AP may also be encouraged by a recent decision in the UK, where Meltwater and other services have to pay mandatory licensing fees for any content that they aggregate from newspapers or other traditional outlets.
As I have tried to describe before, I think the AP's attitude is fundamentally futile, whether it involves stopping reporters from breaking news on Twitter or suing those who reuse or aggregate its content. It is clear that the newswire is threatened by the web and the democratization of distribution, but putting up walls and filing lawsuits is a waste of time and money — and it is not even obvious that the AP's “hot news” claim has a hope of succeeding, since U.S. copyright law is so different from that of the UK. All it does is make the AP seem like a frightened, cornered animal.

George W. Bush invaded Iraq to remove its – ultimately nonexistent – weapons of mass destruction. Barack Obama used cyber weaponry and sanctions to deter Iran from building its own atomic bomb. Now Donald Trump faces North Korea, but stopping its nuclear and missile program may prove impossible, creating what may be his first and perhaps defining international crisis.

Trump has been left to confront North Korea's nuclear activities because his predecessors failed to manage them. The regime in Pyongyang, meanwhile, continues to build ever more dangerous – and hard-to-destroy or intercept – weapons systems.

Commentary: With Trump, nuclear brinkmanship is back
North Korea has been a thorn in the side of the United States since the days of Harry S. Truman. The Korean War came dangerously close to sparking a nuclear confrontation, with the White House preventing U.S. commander Douglas MacArthur from using atomic weapons to stop the Chinese and North Korean armies. Under Pyongyang's current leader Kim Jong-un, it is reaching what may be its most dangerous point since then.
Washington's foreign policy establishment has a host of disagreements with Trump. They think he is wrong on immigration, too soft on Russia, too dangerously hawkish on China. On North Korea they are in the same hole as he is with no real ideas about how to get out.
This is a crisis everyone has seen coming. That's why Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been so desperate to court Trump, visiting him even before the inauguration. As North Korea launched an intermediate medium-range ballistic missile on Sunday, Abe was once again with the president – this time on a golf and bonding trip to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida retreat.
It's also why U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis made his first official trip to the region. His priority was to reassure Japan and South Korea in particular that the United States would stand with them – whatever noises Trump made during his election campaign.
Pyongyang first demonstrated its ability to detonate a crude nuclear device in 2006 – becoming the only Iraq- or Iran-style “rogue state” to ever get that far. Since then, it has continued to develop not just the bombs but also the missiles to deliver them.
Ultimately, the regime would love to have the ability to strike the continental United States – a prospect Trump has tweeted to say “won't happen”. For now, however, there are few signs anyone has a plan to stop it.
It's not that Pyongyang has ambitions to launch some kind of unilateral strike – that would be suicidal. What it wants is a deterrent to protect it from any kind of Iraq- or Libya-style “regime change”.
To achieve that, it first needs a limited number of land-based nuclear-tipped rockets with the ability to strike at least as far as Japan. Each test brings that goal closer.
In the slightly longer term, it wants to be able to mount rockets and warheads on a small fleet of diesel electric submarines. These could be positioned offshore or along its mountainous coastline, hard to track and destroy and – because of the unpredictability of their locations – harder to intercept should the rockets one day be launched.
Nothing the United States has done has seriously frustrated that ambition. In the aftermath of the Iraq invasion, Bush had limited success in using financial aid – and the threat of greater sanctions – to persuade Pyongyang to slow its program, even demolishing a cooling tower at the nuclear facility in Yongbyon.
That still wasn't enough to stop the 2006 nuclear test. And with the accession of Kim Jong-un after the death of his father in 2011, North Korea has been much more single-minded in its atomic ambitions.
Following the apparent success of the Stuxnet computer worm against the Iranian nuclear program, there are suggestions the Obama administration tried something similar against North Korea, but the attempt was much less successful. Such covert activities have likely continued, but they may not be enough.
Since Bill Clinton in the nineties, successive U.S. presidents have been presented with options for more direct action such as air and missile strikes. How successful they would be, however, has never been clear. Pyongyang has no shortage of ways in which it could respond, not least through using conventional artillery to strike U.S. and South Korean targets. The South Korean capital, with its population of more than 10 million, is firmly in range of North Korean guns which, like its nuclear program, are believed to be stored in deep, hard–to-destroy bunkers.
One option now on the table would be for the United States to attempt to intercept a future North Korean missile test with some of its anti-ballistic missiles in the region. That didn't happen on Sunday, perhaps in part because that test occurred over a relatively short distance, mostly over or near North Korean territory.
Attempting to shoot down a longer-range missile test would be easier – but the success of such an action could never be guaranteed. If it failed, the United States would essentially have advertised its inability to intercept a North Korean missile, sparking even greater concern in the region.
The political fallout of a botched intercept would also be significant for any U.S. president.
That leaves diplomatic options, such as applying pressure through China. Beijing's economic support for North Korea is vital to its survival, and the topic was likely high on the agenda during Trump's first call with the Chinese premier. But China is reluctant to do anything that might bring about the collapse of the regime and potentially put South Korean or U.S. troops on its border.
Beijing has also long argued that anything it did to undermine North Korea might hasten the unraveling of the regime, bringing with it the danger that Pyongyang might lash out, perhaps with nuclear force.
There are a variety of potential targets for North Korea even if it cannot reach the United States. They include regional U.S. bases such as Guam as well as South Korea. Many experts believe a Japanese target might be the most likely, not least because of lingering resentment over atrocities in World War Two.
In time, that threat might be enough to prompt Tokyo to acquire its own nuclear arsenal – something that would antagonize Beijing, and arguably make the region even more volatile.
Trump may see himself as a master of the “art of the deal”, and has raised the prospect he might meet North Korean leaders. His problem is that there may be no deal to be done. This situation may become more dangerous – perhaps until something truly cataclysmic happens.

MUTTIAH Muralidaran - once jeered by Australian cricket fans - will help coach our next generation of spinner bowling stars.
The Herald Sun can reveal the controversial Sri Lankan spinner will spend several weeks as a guest coach during an intensive training program at the Brisbane Centre of Excellence in June.
Test cricket's greatest wicket-taker will impart the secrets of his craft and videotape a coaching tutorial for future generations of Australian spinners.
It is a sign of how far the wheel has turned that Murali - who has been repeatedly heckled and even had fruit thrown at him by unruly fans since being no-balled by umpire Darrell Hair in the 1995 Boxing Day Test - will become Australia's potential spin saviour.
Australian great Greg Chappell, who is the only full-time national selector, arranged the visit.
"This is a wonderful opportunity ... Murali has probably forgotten more about spin bowling than most people will ever know in a lifetime," Chappell said.
"Murali is one of the greatest spin bowlers of all time, we are very, very lucky. It is not just Murali's obvious physical skill that will be a huge benefit for our young spinners.
"It is also his mental toughness, his cleverness, his cunning and his ability to be able to set a batsman up and bowl 10-15 overs to a plan."
The news is a shot in the arm for Australian cricket as it conducts a major review into the devastating Ashes loss.
The nation's depleted spin stocks are one of the most pressing issues, with 10 frontline spinners deployed at Test level since Shane Warne retired at the end of the 2006-07 home Ashes series.
Little-known spinners Xavier Doherty and Michael Beer wore the baggy green cap this summer after Nathan Hauritz was sacked before the first Ashes Test.
Murali's action will be recorded live and downloaded on the Academy's pro-batter video machine so batsmen can face a "virtual Murali".

The foundation for Guillermo Del Toro and The Jim Henson Co.'s planned stop-motion film of Pinocchio was an illustrated retelling of the story by Gris Grimly.
Del Toro and Grimly were amongst the screenwriters, with Matthew Robins, a regular contributor to Del Toro films.
Some concept art and a photo of an early maquette had crept online and, last I knew, Del Toro was planning to record the voices this summer. In fact, I believe he was thinking of filming his actors, something like the way Gore Verbinski had worked on Rango. Tom Waits and Daniel Radcliffe were in the frame. Waits was intended to play Gepetto – imagine that.
But it seems it isn't going to happen now.
Grimly posted a straight forward update on his Twitter account:
Short to the point update on Pinocchio for those inquiring: It appears that this is not the right time for such a superior-adventurous flick — Gris Grimly (@GrisGrimly) January 30, 2013
Not pleasing. I love Disney's Pinocchio, I love Luigi Comencini‘s Pinocchio and I was ready for Del Toro and Grimly to pull of a hat trick – three good adaptations of one fine book. Grimly says that the box office of Frankenweenie was a factor.
@thinkbaker There are people like us out there. But they look at numbers. Frankenweenie was a box office failure to them. — Gris Grimly (@GrisGrimly) January 30, 2013
Because nothing says “Kids don't want to see films about wooden boys who come to life and get in deep with the wrong sorts” like saying “Black and white films about resurrected dogs are a hard sell.”
There's better news for Grimly fans just a little earlier in his Twitter feed.
I've been working with a studio, adapting Little Jordan Ray's Muddy Spud into a movie. Off to bounce ideas back and forth with them. — Gris Grimly (@GrisGrimly) January 29, 2013
Little Jordan Ray's Muddy Spud is another of Grimly's books. This one I haven't read but… click!. I'll be reading it soon enough. It sounds a tiny, tiny bit Alice in Wonderland-y…
…which is to say there's an hare, a knight and an oyster in it.
I doubt this one will be stop motion, though it might be. I kind of hope it is. I kind of hope anything is. At all. I don't think there's a single stop-motion feature with any sort of budget behind it right now, is there?
UPDATE: Grimly has told us that, thankfully, Pinocchio is still kicking.

ROELAND PARK, Kan. -- The Roeland Park Police Department is making headlines again -- for good deeds.
In July, an officer helped a young mother who was caught stealing diapers. She was later booked on federal drug charges, but officers say nothing is going to stop them from being good Samaritans.
What one officer did this week, is proof. Following a call for suspicious person at a park, officers arrived to find a greater story.
“Sometimes I have to sleep outside because I want to keep my job. That's just how it is,” Samuel Meixueiro said.
He says he's fallen on hard times. With a checkered past behind him, he says a lot of doors have been shut in his face. He lost his home and has been sleeping in a church; walking from Kansas City to Mission every day for work.
“It's a five-to-six hour walk. I've been doing it so I can keep my job,” Meixueiro said.
On Tuesday, he decided to take a break in Sweeney Park before work. Someone nearby saw him and thought he looked suspicious, and called the cops.
“He shook my hand, we had a chat like I was talking to a friend of mine,” Officer Zach Stamper said.
“As I told him my story he started loosening up. Started realizing I'm not a vagrant. I have a job. I'm doing the best I can,” Meixueiro said.
Officer Stamper gave him a ride to work, but Meixueiro`s story stuck with him long after he dropped him off.
“I was like, wow. My commute, I drive to work and it's done. I couldn't imagine spending five hours a day traveling back and forth to work, let alone on foot,” Officer Stamper said.
He came back a half-hour later with a bike for Meixueiro and a duffel bag for him to carry all of his things in.
“I cried. I couldn't believe it. Things are so hard for me right now. Any kind of help is just a blessing,” Meixueiro said. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”
“It made my day. It made my career,” Officer Stamper said.
Meixueiro says the bike meant the world, but what meant more is someone believing in him and his future. The pair exchanged phone numbers and plan to stay in touch for a long time to come.
It's no great surprise to learn that Nicholas Hytner will be leaving the National in 2015. All the same, it causes a pang of regret. He took over in 2003 when there was a sense that the National was drifting comfortably along without any sustaining vision. One of Hytner's great achievements – along with that of his executive director, Nick Starr, who will also be leaving in 2014 – is that he has restored to the theatre a strong sense of purpose.
How has he done it? First, and crucially, by making its work more available to large numbers of people. "The future of the theatre," the legendary Peter Brook said two decades ago, "is cheap seats." One of Hytner's first actions was to launch the Travelex £10 ticket scheme (now risen to £12) which meant a third of the Olivier's seats were available for the price of a cinema ticket: a brilliant pragamtic gesture that meant huge swaths of the audience for Hytner's 2003 Henry V were NT virgins. Equally important was the creation of NT Live, which broadcasts productions to screens around UK and the world, both live and pre-recorded. I remember going to the very first of these, Hytner's own production of Phèdre, with Helen Mirren, in 2009, and feeling it was revolutionary in its potential to enlarge the audience for drama. So it has proved: at a stroke, it has rescued the theatre from the charge that it is simply for the London elite.
It's one thing to open up the National. It is just as important to ensure the work itself is of the highest quality. And Hytner has done that by enlisting the support of some of the best living dramatists, and by ensuring that the National has been at the forefront of the argument about the state of the nation. His own opening production was a Henry V that reflected the turmoil over the Iraq war, and over the last decade we've had plays about the economic crisis, global warming and racial divisions. Everyone can come up with their own list of favourite NT shows. My own top five, in no special order, would be Howard Davies's breathtaking 2010 production of Bulgakov's The White Guard, David Hare's investigative Iraq play Stuff Happens, Lee Hall's much-loved The Pitmen Painters, and Hytner's own productions of Alan Bennett's The History Boys and Richard Bean's One Man, Two Guvnors. But, while they're all strong contenders, it's worth pointing out that Hytner has also embraced young, boundary-breaking companies such as Kneehigh and Punchdrunk, and sanctioned experimental work by directors such as Katie Mitchell.
Although I'm glad Hytner finally overcame his distaste for George Bernard Shaw, more might have been done to explore 20th-century British drama. But Hytner's achievement has been colossal, not just in expanding the National's audience and providing high-quality work, but in his readiness to act as spokesman for a British theatre threatened by insanely myopic government cuts.
Who should succeed him in 2015? You could make up a long list of names that would include Sam Mendes, Michael Grandage, Dominic Cooke, Rupert Goold, Marianne Elliott, Josie Rourke, Thea Sharrock, Jonathan Church and Howard Davies. But it's a measure of Hytner's success that whoever takes over will inherit a thriving theatre built on pragmatism and vision.
Image caption The game's producers stress it is fictional; critics say it glorifies violence
At least 40 people have been killed in Ciudad Juarez since Friday, making it one of the most violent weekends in the city in years, Mexican officials say.
The killings were all apparently related to the drug-trafficking gangs.
Juarez, on border with the US, saw more than 3,000 murders in 2010, making it by far Mexico's deadliest city.
State lawmakers have asked meanwhile asked the federal authorities to ban a computer game based on drug shootouts in the city between the cartels.
Ricardo Boone Salmon, a congressman for Chihuahua state, said they were calling on the interior ministry to ban Call of Juarez: The Cartel.
"It is true there is a serious crime situation, which we are not trying to hide," Mr Boone Salmon told the Associated Press.
"But we also should not expose children to this kind of scenarios so that they are going to grow up with this kind of image and lack of values."
The game is due for release later in 2011, according to the website of the developer, Ubisoft Entertainment.
The advertising on the site urges players to "Take justice into your own hands", describing the game as a "bloody road trip from Los Angeles to Juarez".
Ubisoft says the game is purely fictional.
"While Call of Juarez: The Cartel touches on subjects relevant to current events in Juarez, it does so in a fictional manner that makes the gaming experience feel more like being immersed in an action movie than in a real-life situation," a Ubisoft spokesman told Reuters news agency.
The latest upsurge in violence in Ciudad Juarez saw 20 murders on Friday, 19 on Saturday and at least one on Sunday, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office said.
"These figures are quite high. It is one of the most violent weekends in Ciudad Juarez in years," the spokesman told the French news agency, AFP.
Mexico has seen more than 34,000 drug-related killings since President Felipe Calderon launched his crackdown on the drug cartels in late 2006.
Northern states have seen much of the violence, as cartels fight each other for control of the lucrative drug-smuggling routes to the US.
On Saturday, President Calderon announced that four additional battalions would be deployed to the north-east of the country.
At any given signal power the only theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be communicated is the noise level. For wireless transmissions to and from biomedical implants the challenges, or rather the problems we face, are essentially power problems. Engineers have pushed RF powering of implants to their practical limits and there's still left much to be desired. Stanford researchers now suggest that the way to move beyond the legal, physiological, and physical constraints on the energy that can be beamed to an implant may be to move away from electromagnetic waves, and switch to ultrasound instead. Not content just to wax philosophical about these issues, they have now demonstrated proof of principle for ultrasound power transmission into the brain — or at least into a three-centimeter-thick slab of chicken meat.
There is not a lot of room in the brain for on-board energy storage in the form of batteries, or through complex bioharvesting provisions. In that case powering an implant is much like sending energy to a beam-powered spacecraft from Earth. If we assume that the base station on Earth can be a giant laser that can focus as much energy onto the spacecraft as it can handle, the main limit becomes the size of the energy absorber. For the spacecraft it is the sail; for RF it is the antenna; and for ultrasound, the vibrational energy absorber (in this case a piezo receiver). For the deceleration phase (and the optional return trip), there will be even less energy available because the laser light will need to somehow be reflected and refocused back to the spacecraft. It is much the same for powering an implant with the exception that the implant needn't return power, only information.
What really puts the kibosh on the above mentioned theoretical limits to power are the down-to-earth limits of the human bodies. The FCC loosely, and we do mean loosely, embodies these flesh and blood (and societal as the case may be) frailties in a few mandatory guidelines: namely that RF intensity be limited to between 1 and 10 mW/cm2, depending on the application. While the effects of RF on living cells is still being explored and debated, nobody wants an FCC snoop truck to classify their brain as a violation. For ultrasound, it is the FDA who steps in and provides for up to 720 mW/cm2 of power. If you notice, as the Stanford researchers are quick to point out, that's about two orders of magnitude difference in power available in favor of ultrasound. But what really kills it for RF is the high attenuation in tissue, and more importantly, the huge mismatch between what we will tentatively call the “aperture,” and the wavelength for millimeter-sized antennas.
Using 65nm GP CMOS technology, the Stanford researchers managed to compress all the necessary hardware into a footprint just a couple of millimeters in dimension, with the antenna being the largest component. Using the chicken breast brain proxy, their implant was able to support a DC load of 100 µW. They were also able to uplink back out using good old RF at megabits-per-second speeds, which at higher frequencies (here 4GHz) compared to ultrasound has some advantages for data transmission. Not to confuse, but we should mention that their implant could also receive RF data. This is important because the data available from the ultrasound power downlink was only in the kilobits-per-second range. In a practical implant scenario, the downlink is likely to be lower bandwidth control signals while the uplink would have more intensive cell activity or image data.
While the current prototype may be the size of the head of a ballpoint pen (pictured top), the next-generation implant is expected to be one-tenth that size. At this scale the now seemingly incredible concept of ultrasonically-interrogated neural smart dust is placed more in the realm of the possible. For brain-wide implantation, entirely new physical constraints come into play but other researchers have already laid much of the theoretical groundwork for what we might be able to handle. Here the primary limit becomes the ability of the brain to dissipate heat from the implant, with things like mechano-vibratory disruption and possible mutational mechanisms being slightly lesser concerns.
As we have seen RF is still a powerful medium and its use in implants will likely remain with us for the long haul. Advanced antenna-matching techniques and mid-field focusing technology will undoubtedly extend their range of applicability. To that point, Ada Poon and others at Stanford have recently received research grants to produce implants that will address maladies like pain and depression. However as ultrasound hardware components increase in sophistication, and shrink, it will likely become impossible to ignore their advantages for raw power.

The Kansas City Chiefs gave S Daniel Sorensen the second round level tender ($2.7 million) as a restricted free agent and they gave K Cairo Santos the low level tender ($1.8 million). We predicted Albert Wilson, their third and final restricted free agent, wouldn't receive a tender.
We were wrong.
Chiefs give WR Albert Wilson the lowest level RFA tender per source. — ProFootballTalk (@ProFootballTalk) March 9, 2017
This means the Chiefs will pay Wilson about $1.8 million next year if it ends up going througho. Another team could come in and try to sign him but the Chiefs would be able to match. If they didn't match, they wouldn't receive any compensation in return (as opposed to a second round tender, where they would receive a second round pick in return ... the difference being the second round tender is more expensive).
I thought that was a little high for the Chiefs fourth or fifth receiver. Apparently the Chiefs disagree. I wanted Wilson back until they had someone better but I thought they could bring him back on a lesser deal to save some cap space.

The elements, discovered by scientists in Japan, Russia and America, are the first to be added to the table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were added.
The four were verified on 30 December by the US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the global organisation that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement.
IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118.

The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the Riken institute in Japan.
Kosuke Morita, who was leading the research at Riken, said his team now planned to “look to the unchartered territory of element 119 and beyond.”
Ryoji Noyori, former Riken president and Nobel laureate in chemistry said: “To scientists, this is of greater value than an Olympic gold medal”.
The elements, which currently bear placeholder names, will be officially named by the teams that discovered them in the coming months. Element 113 will be the first element to be named in Asia.
“The chemistry community is eager to see its most cherished table finally being completed down to the seventh row,” said Professor Jan Reedijk, president of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of IUPAC.
“IUPAC has now initiated the process of formalising names and symbols for these elements temporarily named as ununtrium, (Uut or element 113), ununpentium (Uup, element 115), ununseptium (Uus, element 117), and ununoctium (Uuo, element 118).”
New elements can be named after a mythological concept, a mineral, a place or country, a property or a scientist.
The four new elements, all of which are synthetic, were discovered by slamming lighter ­nuclei into each other and tracking the following decay of the radioactive superheavy elements.
Like other superheavy elements that populate the end of the periodic table, they only exist for fractions of a second before decaying into other elements.
• This article was amended on 4 January 2016. The reference to the new elements being “manmade” was changed to “synthetic” to follow Guardian style guidance on the use of gender-neutral terms.
Happy birthday, Jessica Jones! Krysten Ritter is celebrating her 35th birthday today.
Ritter is best known to us for her portrayal of Jessica Jones, a private detective with superpowers and a tragic past, in her self-titled Marvel Cinematic Universe Netflix series. Ritter's performance of the complex Marvel character earned her a Best Actress nomination in a Drama Series at the 21st Critics' Choice Awards (January 2016). She ended up losing to The Leftovers' Carrie Coon.
Ritter's Jessica Jones will next appear in Netflix's street-level superhero team-up series The Defenders, which is currently filming and is expected to be released in late-2017. Ritter is also known for her roles in Breaking Bad, Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, Veronica Mars, Gilmore Girls, and Big Eyes.
Ritter was born in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, raised on a farm outside Shickshinny, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Northwest Area High School in 2000. Prior to her acting fame, Ritter worked as an international model, doing catalog, print, and runway work in New York, Milan, Paris, and Tokyo!
PHILADELPHIA - Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania demonstrate for the first time that the immune system influences the skin microbiome. A new study found that the skin microbiome - a collection of microorganisms inhabiting the human body - is governed, at least in part, by an ancient branch of the immune system called complement. In turn, it appears microbes on the skin tweak the complement system, as well as immune surveillance of the skin. They found that complement may, in part, be responsible for maintaining a diverse set of microbes on our skin and keeping our skin healthy, which could play a role in a host of skin diseases.
Penn researchers Elizabeth Grice, PhD, assistant professor of Dermatology, and John Lambris, PhD, the Dr. Ralph and Sallie Weaver Professor of Research Medicine in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, published findings in the August 26 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Commensal, non-pathogenic bacteria that live on the skin provide an important service to their host, blocking pathogenic microbes from gaining a foothold, among other functions. In previous research, Grice and colleagues illuminated the great diversity of bacteria living on the skin using DNA-based sequence analysis of bacterial genes. However, until this study, very little was known about how the immune system influences those populations of bacteria living on the skin.
The complement system is like a molecular alarm system and first responder, Grice explains. "It leads the counterattack against microbial insult." The system is an evolutionarily ancient branch of the immune response and a key function is marking microbial and dying host cells for elimination.
Complement also has inflammatory functions, and the team explored the relationship between the signaling of one particular inflammatory protein of the complement cascade, C5aR (the C5a receptor), and the skin microbiome. Their findings highlight a previously unrecognized role for complement on the skin.
The team treated one group of mice with an inhibitor of C5aR, and another with an inactive analog and compared the animals' skin microbiome before and after treatment, based on DNA sequence analysis. They found that while the absolute number of microbes on the skin remained unchanged, the population diversity shifts in animals treated with a C5aR inhibitor compared to those who were not, with some groups of organisms increasing in abundance and others petering out.
The team also looked at the impact of C5aR inhibitor treatment on the immune system itself. They found that genes associated with immune surveillance were downregulated in the skin in inhibitor-treated animals, as was the number of immune cells overall.
Those results suggest that the complement system somehow influences the microbiome. To see if the effect also works in reverse, the team asked whether mice grown in a germ-free environment would express genes encoding complement components differently than mice grown under normal conditions. The microbiome did modulate the immune system: the animals grown in germ-free conditions expressed complement genes at lower levels in the skin than control animals.
"There's a balance between the microbiome and the immune system," Grice concludes. "Decreased microbial diversity has been associated with skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema. Complement may in part be responsible for maintaining that diversity and keeping our skin healthy."
And that's important, she says, because it is becoming increasingly evident that many diseases are caused (or at least exacerbated) not by pathogens per se, but by "dysbiosis," an imbalance in the microbial community.
"That balance is probably highly evolved so our optimal skin health is maintained when these two factors are in balance and communicating. And it's when you disrupt one of those components that you can trigger or exacerbate a skin disorder or infection."
Such a symbiotic relationship has already been documented in the gut.
While this study did not address the cause and effect between host and microbe, this interaction ultimately represents a potential therapeutic target, Grice says. If researchers can work out the skin microbiome and its relationship with complement, they might be able to tweak the microbial population one way or another to, for instance, modulate complement activation in patients with diseases that are in part caused by dysregulated or dysfunctional signaling, for example, psoriasis.
On the other hand, complement inhibitors, such as those being developed by Lambris' lab and some of which are in clinical trials, may be used to therapeutically manipulate the skin microbiome back to a "healthy," less dysbiotic state.
Now, Grice says, her team is working to better understand the mechanism of the complement-microbiome interaction, as well as its relationship to normal skin health and pathogenesis.
"I think our definition and labeling of 'bad microbes' needs to change," Grice says. "We need to think about how we nurture our microbes rather than eradicate them. They evolved with us for a reason."

On the radio Wednesday morning, Nationals manager Matt Williams was thrown a hypothetical question about the struggling Bryce Harper, and whether he thought a stint in the minors could help him. It was sort of a tossed-off question, one thoroughly and unequivocally answered by Williams. But he really, really doesn't want to hear anyone bringing it up again.
The question and answer came on Williams' weekly radio spot with The Junkies on 106.7 The Fan. The Washington Post has the full transcript—here's a snippet:
"Is it a terrible idea – just a wacky idea – to send him down to Syracuse for a week, just to get him right?" one of the Junkies asked. "Is that just a stupid idea on my part?" "I don't know," Williams answered. "I don't think it's stupid. Generally, if you have young players, that's what you do. But this guy is a special young player. We all know that. It's different...But I don't know if it's a good idea at this point to do that, because it's completely different pitching. We all know the big difference between Triple A pitching and big league pitching. It's probably more of an option to have him feel good here, get it back."
This is a reasonable answer. Bryce Harper has already proven that he has Major League talent, and Williams believes he's not going to recapture his swing facing Minor League pitching.
But in his press conference yesterday afternoon, Williams was asked again about the possibility of sending down Harper, who after a 1-for-3 night is now hitting .250/.337/.359. Williams wasn't happy.
"I will caution everybody in this room: the minute you think you can read my freaking mind, you're sorely mistaken. It pisses me off to even think about the fact that somebody would take a comment I made on the radio and infer that I am thinking one way or another. I've had it. Don't do it anymore. "Bryce Harper is one of the guys on our team, he's a very important part of our team. Just like everybody else is. "Do we understand each other? "It's not fair to the kid, it's not fair to the rest of the guys in that clubhouse, to even think about sending Bryce Harper to the minor leagues, or to cause a stir. It's unacceptable. It won't happen. Is that good enough for you?"

If "should Bryce Harper be sent to the minors?" wasn't a thing before—and it shouldn't have been—it kind of is now.
San Jose Sharks prospect Nikolay Goldobin is having a good first complete season as a pro in North America. He mainly played for the Sharks' affiliate in the AHL, the San Jose Barracuda, but he also played his first games in the NHL, getting his first goal on Oct. 17 against the New York Islanders. In this translated interview, originally appearing on the popular Russian website Sport-Express, Nikolay Goldobin talked about his debut in the NHL, working with Igor Larionov and his early move overseas.
* For the original Sport-Express article by Igor Rabiner, click here.
– You have a rather unusual resume: first Canadian junior leagues, then Finnish senior league. Was it easy to get through all this?
– No, the first steps were very hard. I left for Canada when I was 16, I didn't know any English and my parents are the most important people in my life. But they understood that it was for my good. So it wasn't a problem. Then I learned English and now I happily live alone.
– You spent one season in the MHL. Why you preferred moving overseas instead of the usual path MHL – KHL?
– It was a mutual decision with my agent, Igor Larionov. He advised me to move to Canada and did what he needed to to get me there. I couldn't refuse and moved to the OHL.
– Sarnia wasn't a top team.
– Yes, I managed to become one of the leaders of the team. It was good as I also had a lot of ice time.
http://gty.im/468852971
– How did Larionov find you?
– He has assistants in Russia and I had been noticed when I was playing in the MHL. Then we had a chat on Skype and started working together.
– Weren't you forced to stay in Russia, for example by telling you that you won't be called to the junior national team?
– No, there was nothing like that. And I played for the national team several times, even if I didn't play at the U18 WJC in Sochi. I think that the then-head coach (former NHL player Igor Kravchuk) didn't like something, but I'm not sure what.
– That season you were awarded with OHL Rookie of the Year honors.
– Yes, I had a good season, therefore I think I was going to play. But he told me that I didn't make the team.
– Did you have any idol in your childhood?
– [Sidney] Crosby and [Alex] Ovechkin. But now I want to become the best, therefore I don't have any idol.
– What is the secret of [Team Russia U20 head coach] Valeri Bragin, who is called Mr. Comeback?
– He knows how to spark his teams. Unfortunately we couldn't reach Canada, but we went 1-5 to 4-5, he therefore has some secrets.
http://gty.im/461785276
– In what way did he spark you that time?
– He talks a lot about Russia. He told us that we represent Russia and that we can't simply lose that way. That we had to go and show that we are the best. Of course I can't refer the exact words (laughs).
– That year Bragin used to walk directly on the boards to talk with players. Weren't you scared that he would fall down to the ice?
– Quite the contrary, it motivated us even more. Bragin can do things that no one else does. And that was very cool.
– You had good chemistry with Carolina Hurricanes prospect Sergei Tolchinsky, even in the junior national team. Was your duo born while playing for CSKA Moscow?
– Yes we played together some 10 years. He plays in the AHL himself and he's doing great, scoring and giving assists. I follow him and we are still in touch.
– Were you satisfied about the way you played at the 2015 WJC?
– I'm never happy about my play. I know I can do better.
– After the draft you spent one season in Finland. Was that another of Larionov's ideas?
– It was once again a decision we took together. I had two options, to spend another year in the OHL or to go play in Finland against men and gather experience. Of course I picked Europe. Closer to Russia, just one hour from Moscow. Of course you can always play better, but I think I did well, I really enjoyed that season and all the adventures.
http://gty.im/496565758
– Are your KHL rights owned by CSKA?
– Yes, but I don't want to play in the KHL now. My dream is to become a full-time NHL player.
– At the start of the season, you were called up to the main team. Was it due to Logan Couture's injury?
– I hoped to be with the team since the season's start. I did not, but then they called me because of some injuries. They sent me down, then they called me up, then down again… But I was lucky to get the chances I did.
– And you scored your first NHL goal in your second game, assisted by Joe Thornton. Were you iced in the first line right away?
– Yes, I played with Thornton and Joe Pavelski. Maybe the coaches wanted to test me while playing with the team's best players. I thought that I had to play in the second or third line and get iced against the best line of the opposition. I can't say that I was ready for it, but I had something to learn. Although it hasn't been as hard as I thought initially. This is the best league in the world. I started realizing that I can play at this level. I'm ready to do everything to get it back.
– How do you like the NHL's best beards, Thornton and Brent Burns?
– They are great! But I think that it would take me 30 years to get to something like that.
– On Nov. 6, you had an assist against the Florida Panthers. Did you ask Jaromir Jagr for an autograph?
– I really wanted to. When I was playing against him I was like “Is this true or am I dreaming?” He's the third overall scorer in the whole NHL history! But in the end I didn't ask, I thought it would have been a bit strange.
– What did your coach Peter DeBoer told you when you got sent down?
– In those cases you're going to hear the standard phrase “we'll count on you in the future.”
– What would you have preferred for the season, playing less minutes in the NHL with the Sharks or having a big role with the Barracuda?
– Of course my dream is to play in the NHL. I think that if I played with the Sharks in the lower lines, then I would have been noticed for my game and sent to the first lines. It's always happening. That's why I'd rather have played in the NHL.
– Is it a good thing that the AHL team plays in San Jose too?
– It's great. A big plus for me. I don't have to fly and if they call me to the NHL team I just need to change the doors.
– Does Evgeny Nabokov, now Sharks' development coach, help you?
– Yes, he's a great person. Having a Russian within the team is always good. If I have a question I approach him right away. He's always joking with the younger guys, and he even wears as a kid.
The photo above shows a muted double rainbow arching over a freshly cut grain crop, punctuated by intense lightning. It was snapped near Bad Mergentheim in southern Germany in the late afternoon of July 12, 2010. The camera is directed at the rainbow (antisolar point), and while the Sun has broken through in the west, the west-to-east moving thunderstorm has darkened the eastern sky and still packs a punch. Even after a seemingly innocuous thunderstorm has passed by, lightning can still pose a serious threat. It's best to stay in a protected area until you can no longer hear thunder.
Photo details: This photo is a still frame from a movie clip, made with a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera and a 24-105 mm lens. The settings were 1/30 second exposure; f/7.1; ISO of 400.
He wrote his suicide note in his own blood, as it was flowing out of him. It was addressed to me. He was apologizing for the administrative headaches that he anticipated his death would cause.
He was in his mid-30s, and I was only in my 20s, but I was his company commander, and apparently the only person he related to at work. The MPs brought me the note days later, saying this was a new one on them, but since he had not succeeded, technically no crime had occurred, so they were delivering his note. That was a strange day. I do not expect a lot of us get letters written in blood.
He had been found in time, and I'd already seen him in the hospital, so I expected it because he told me. But I had not seen the signs in time, ahead of the time, to prevent the whole process.
He was in his 40s, fit and intelligent, near the top of his class at West Point and in every military program after that. We both taught at West Point, but did not meet until Iraq. There, we both did things relating to a particular kind of force. He was upset by a letter a contractor sent calling him a fool. We went on one last mission, down into Dora to reclaim a site which would become a headquarters for a part of the Iraqi forces. The next day he and I both briefed the commanding general on our specific topics. Then he went back to his hooch, and a few hours later put his 9mm to his head. But I had not seen the signs in time, ahead of the time, to prevent him.
Want me to go on? I can. Oh, how I can. But that would be beside the point.
The point is that we are losing men and women, and we should not be. Not now, not in the 21st century. We should see these signs and step in, and me and my Army are failing so far. But then, so are you. We can work to prevent the suicides of those in uniform. But we need you, all of you, to step in when the soldier is no longer a soldier, but a "veteran."
The VA just put out new numbers. Suicides are spiking among young veterans.
Gentlemen, this is a scourge. It must be purged. We, as men, must help our fellow men and women and change this situation. So take the time and do a little research of your own. It really won't take that long, but if you have a veteran with you, especially a young combat veteran, just keep a weather eye open. Talk, learn, listen, and pay attention. It really is not hard. Better that than looking back and remembering, and dreaming of what you might have fking done differently, for the rest of your entire life. Believe me on that one friends. Believe.
Do not fail, as I have, over and over and over, to spot the signs. And then, my fellow men, have the damned courage to do something. The Veterans Crisis Hotline is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at (800)-273-8255, press 1, or here.
This will be only the first of my essays on this topic, because it is important. And if the topic is too depressing for you, well then man up.
This message is not approved by the DoD, the Army, or any unit. It damned well should be, but it isn't, because I did not ask. I can be reached, as always, at R_Bateman_LTC@hotmail.com.
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. undoubtedly knows more about China than any other presidential candidate.
After all, the 51-year-old Republican served as President Barack Obama's first U.S. ambassador to China before returning in the spring to run for president. He's also been deputy assistant secretary of commerce for Asia, U.S. Ambassador to Singapore and deputy U.S. trade representative. He speaks Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Hokkien. His ties to the region date back to 1979, when he lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, and he first visited mainland China three decades ago.
In a July 26, 2011, appearance at Dartmouth College, Huntsman made a surprising claim about China during a question-and-answer session following his speech.
When an audience member who had recently traveled to China asked Huntsman for his thoughts about the "huge imbalance" between the millions of Chinese studying English and the far fewer number of U.S. students studying Chinese, Huntsman replied: "Would you like the answer in Chinese or English? It's interesting to note that the largest English-speaking nation today, or soon to be, is China."
Huntsman went on to say he had visited Chinese universities "and I always found that they were keenly interested in English, in our political system, in our economic system, in trying to figure out what makes America so unique. In order to crack that code, they had to master English. So you found the lot of students who were very, very interested in learning English."
The same enthusiasm, he asserted, was also evident in Chinese high schools and middle schools.
Yo, it's painful enough that our blenders are made in China, but could this mean that even our slang is soon to be imported from Guangzhou?
For Huntsman's statement to be accurate, China, with a population of more than 1.3 billion, would need roughly 300 million English speakers to best the United States, which has the third-largest population in the world. That's because most, though by no means all, U.S. residents (population 309 million in the 2010 Census) speak English.
Then there's India, a former British colony with a population of 1.2 billion, second only to China. The most popular language in India is Hindi, spoken by 41 percent of the population, and there are 14 other official languages, ranging from Bengali to Sanskrit, according to the CIA Factbook. English is a "subsidiary official language" in India "but is the most important language for national, political, and commercial communication," the Factbook reported.
Asked for substantiation of China's mega-English status, Huntsman's New Hampshire spokesman, Michael Levoff, cited a a 2011 "English Proficiency Index" from EF, or Education First, a company that offers language training in more than 50 countries.
"Indeed, although it is very difficult to measure the number of people who speak English in each country because of different definitions of proficiency, the British Council estimated in 2010 that India had anywhere between 55 and 350 million English speakers while a report published by Cambridge University Press estimates that China has 250 to 350 million English learners," the EF English Proficiency Index stated. "It appears that China is poised to surpass India in the number of English speakers in the coming years, if it has not already done so."
But academic experts who follow the globalization of English said the issue of proficiency cannot be ignored. It's one thing to be an "English learner," another to be a skilled "English speaker."
Put another way, plenty of Americans took four years of high school Spanish and were "learners" at the time, not "speakers." Now they visit Cancun and can barely remember, "¿Dónde está el baño?" ("Where is the bathroom?")
David Crystal, an honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Wales-Bangor, and author of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, said by e-mail that he believes "India is still ahead of China at present," and that Huntsman's use of "or soon to be" is "the operative phrase."
Equally important, Crystal said statistics about both countries are "very much guesswork" and he noted that both India and China are cited as "low proficiency" countries in the EF Index.
"On the whole, proficiency in India is greater than in China, and English teaching measures are more solid. So I'd be distinctly suspicious of claims being made about China," Crystal wrote.
Indeed, a 2006 Cambridge University Press paper by Jian Yang of Seattle University, "Learners and Users of English in China," concluded that China had a "huge English-knowing population of 200-350 million," but that most were not "proficient bilingual users of the language."
But, as Huntsman said, interest in English is growing fast in China, and five years is a long time in that context.
Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature at University of Pennsylvania, said by e-mail that English "is widely used" by Chinese companies, that many radio and TV programs are presented in English, and that "the craze for learning English is palpable."
A 2009 forum sponsored by the British Council reported that there are approximately 50,000 English language training institutes in China, and that People's Daily in 2008 said there are about 300 million "consumers" of English language training in China, mainly between the ages of 20 and 40, with another 350 million children of school age offering a huge potential for further growth.
But again, those are learners, not necessarily speakers.
Mair said he agreed with Crystal about the quality of English in India as opposed to China, but also said there is credence to Huntsman's claim.
"Countless Indians speak the most beautiful English you can imagine, but there are few Chinese who do so," said Mair, who estimates that each country now has around 350 million English speakers.
English translations in China are sometimes so notorious that they've come to be known as "Chinglish." One often-cited sign meant to say "Be Careful Not to Slip and Fall," but it reads, "Slip and Fall Down Carefully."
Mair, who writes about such translations on UPenn's Language Log blog, recently posted about a Chinese airline's sign that meant to say "Please wait behind the one meter line" but read "Wait outside rice-flour noodle."
So are the Chinese about to eat our lunch when it comes to our native tongue? Would most Chinese with some knowledge of English really understand that last sentence?
There is some truth to Huntsman's underlying point that there is tremendous growth in English proficiency in China. But it's important to note there is a significant difference between English learners and speakers. The statistics and our interviews with experts indicate China is still far away from having the largest number of speakers. We rate his claim Half True.
The Grizzlies are gauging the trade market for soon-to-be free agents Jeff Green and Courtney Lee, reports Marc Stein of ESPN.com, who cautions that the team isn't shopping them. Rather, they're doing what they're “supposed to do” with players on expiring deals and seeing what they could get in return before they have the chance to walk away in the summer, Stein writes. Still, it appears the team has more willingness to trade Green and Lee than fellow veterans Zach Randolph and Tony Allen, whom they have no interest in sending away, according to Stein.
The 29-year-old Green, who makes $9.45MM, doesn't appear to be the most popular teammate in Memphis, where one prominent Grizzlies player “wanted to wring his neck” after a loss two weeks ago, expressing profound frustration with the combo forward, as Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal reported. Green's attitude hasn't been stellar, either, according to Tillery. His play has left much to be desired, as his 11.4 points per game are his fewest since he posted 10.5 as a rookie in 2007/08. Coach Dave Joerger recently removed him from the starting lineup.
Memphis reportedly turned away entreaties from the Timberwolves about a swap of Lee for Kevin Martin, so it doesn't appear that Lee will come cheaply. The 30-year-old who's a career 38.2% 3-point shooter started the season in a troublesome slump from behind the arc, canning just 22.0% of his treys through November, but since then, he's nailed 44.4% of them. He's seeing a $5.675MM salary this year.
Complicating matters for the Grizzlies is that they're only about $2MM shy of the luxury tax threshold. They sit fifth in the Western Conference at 27-20 following early-season questions about Joerger's future. It's not entirely clear what sort of offers they'd find most enticing in exchange for Green and Lee, though it doesn't seem the club is ready for a tear-down.
What do you think the Grizzlies would be able to get for Green and Lee? Leave a comment to give your input.
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The world's major central banks, stung by this year's $81-million heist in Bangladesh, have launched a task force to consider setting broad rules to protect the vast network of cross-border banking from cyberattacks, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.

The committee of central banks, part of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, set up the task force this summer. It has begun gathering information from members on their protections against fraud, said the sources, who requested anonymity because work had just begun.
The task force could ultimately set cybersecurity standards around inter-bank transfers that may be adopted globally. The new principles or guidance could cover responsibilities of banks that send and receive money transfers, and networks like SWIFT that transmit payment instructions in correspondent banking.
The task force also aims to consider recommending the steps each player should follow if a central bank falls short of protecting its systems from hackers, what role domestic regulators should play, and how to respond if another breach happens, the sources said.
“It's in its formative stages,” said one of the sources. “It's what needs to happen ... but it's not a fast process.” The other source said a focus of the task force will be identifying where the “breakdowns” are hidden in correspondent banking.
The BIS, which oversees the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) that launched the effort, declined to comment.
The sources said the attempted theft of nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as other cyberattacks that since came to light, helped spur the committee of central banks.
In early February, hackers breached the Bangladesh central bank's systems and peppered the Fed with payment requests via the SWIFT global money-transfer network. Some requests were filled, amounting to $81 million that disappeared mostly into Philippines casinos. A Reuters investigation found the theft happened amid missed warning signs and miscommunication between the New York Fed and Bangladesh Bank.
After months of international finger-pointing, central banks and police investigators now appear to be cooperating to try to recover the funds, find the culprits, and strengthen a banking system found to be vulnerable.
“It just shows the vulnerabilities and, with the Bangladesh example, how a lot of money can be redirected in a very short amount of time,” U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat who has urged the Group of 20 to prioritize cyber crime, said in a recent interview.
The National Bank of Belgium, which directly oversees SWIFT, has a leading role in the task force, one of the sources said.
The New York Fed, which handles some $80 billion in global money transfers each day and which is also taking part in the task force, said in June it was talking with other central banks about cybersecurity and the structure of global payments.
Belgium's central bank, the New York Fed and SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, each declined to comment.
The task force would have representatives from some of the most influential 25 central banks that make up the BIS payments committee, including the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the People's Bank of China, and the Fed. However it was unclear who was tapped to serve.
The committee, which does not include Bangladesh Bank, promotes the safety and efficiency of bank-to-bank payments and settlements. It could open consultations with outside entities as early as this year, said one of the sources, adding it could take another couple of years before anything is formalized.
Morrissey has detailed his upcoming tour dates. New shows behind his upcoming album Low in High School are set to kick off October 31 with a show at Portland, OR's Schnitzer Concert Hall and run until December 7 at Boston, MA's Orpheum Theatre. See his full itinerary here. Morrissey recently put out the first single from his new album, “Spent the Day in Bed.” In the lead-up to his previously announced shows at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, “Morrissey” was added to an L.A. freeway exit sign.
After canceling a string of dates last December, Morrissey announced his first 2017 concert with a Trump meme. After playing a couple of shows earlier this year, he abruptly exited after he lost his voice mid-performance at his Tucson, Arizona stop. He then canceled his San Antonio show to “fully recuperate.” In the lead-up to some previously announced November shows at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, “Morrissey” was added to an L.A. freeway exit sign.

If you are the type who goes to Whole Foods and spends 20 bucks on single-mill black truffle olive oil to drizzle on your portobello burgers, then dear god, stop reading now.
A few years back, documentary maker Morgan Spurlock ate McDonald's for 30 days. He gained 24 pounds, his cholesterol shot through the roof, and he experienced sexual dysfunction.
Besides, what are you doing shopping for truffle oil when the stock market is crumbling?
This story is about real food — the stuff that you can buy for a buck. If the world came to an end and you were living in a bomb shelter, this food would still be edible.
Some friends looked at me as if I had just received an assignment to be embedded with the Taliban.
Mostly it was about trying to eat a pile of prepackaged foods without getting indigestion. Or sexual dysfunction. Indigestion I can handle.
Eating only Dollarama food would be a commentary on the stock market downturn, of food banks and the need for a living wage, the globalization of the food product industry, trans fats and poverty and the rise of chronic disease. At least that's what I pitched to the editor.
Bank of Canada Gov. Mark Carney has said we have taken on too much debt as consumers are retrenching their spending habits.
If Spurlock could make an entire documentary out of eating Big Macs for 30 days, I figured I could at least spend a week solely eating at my favourite store, Dollarama. What better place to shop during a recession?
I told Madhavi, who prides herself on making an Extreme Couponer look like a flagrant spendthrift but refuses to eat dollar-store food, that no animals would be hurt in this experiment, except possibly my liver.
“Really. You're really doing what?” says a wide-eyed Moneyville Moms On Money blogger Madhavi Acharya Tom-Yew when I tell her of my experiment. “I don't think you should go through with it.”
A confession: Unlike the Star's Katie Daubs, a picky eater who gags at the taste of mustard, I have no problems eating day-old pizza or doughnuts that have been calcified into Precambrian rock by sitting around on the windowsill for too long.
For breakfast, I have been known to eat McCain's frozen coconut crème pie, bought on sale for a dollar at No Frills. Once, when filling in for Star movie critic Peter Howell, I was kicked out of the reserved seats at the theatre because no real critic would be caught dead consuming an extra large tub of buttered popcorn and a jumbo Pepsi while doing the serious job of watching a movie. (I think it was Cheaper by the Dozen 2.)
So, I can say that for most of my life, I have basically trained harder than any Navy Seal for this assignment. Minus the push-ups.
But that does not impress nutritionist and dietitian Nicole Springle, acting director of nutrition for the Cleveland Clinic Canada.
“Wow. Eating this stuff for a week is going to be a real challenge,” says Springle.
Springle says without fresh fruit and vegetables, my body will eventually start to deplete of basic vitamins and minerals such as potassium and magnesium. I will then eventually die. But maybe not in a week.
She warns me that eating my favourite green gummy bears does not count as vegetables.
“Good luck,” she says. “But you may need to detox after.”
MONDAY
The dollar store is the graveyard where brands go to die. There is Hannah Montana energizing foot scrub for a buck. Daisy Fuentes Shampoo for $2. Toy Story 3 bubble bath. You didn't know there was a Toy Story 3 did you?
The Dollarama at Woodside Square in Scarborough is your typical 10,000-square-foot behemoth. It's amazing what you can get at the dollar store. Dollarama used to be one of the few “honest” dollar stores in town where everything really was a buck. Over the last few years it's now priced items anywhere from a buck to $2. Still cheap, but not quite the bargain it used to be.
Rest assured, it is the place where you can always pick up a knitted bear sweater with a maple leaf for $1.50. The Scream Halloween mask is $2.
The food selection though has exploded over the years. The dollar store always had a five-star snack-food aisle. But now it's stocked with enough ready-to-eat meals to keep 2012 apocalypse types happy.
The variety is incredible. And there are even brand names like Snapple and E.D. Smith. But mostly it is a bunch of stuff made in Egypt and Portugal with names I've never heard of. I marvel at the miracle of the supply chain that something that could be made in Egypt can still be sold for a buck in Canada. I also wonder what the heck they put in it.
Breakfast: I am rushing in to work. Have an Insta-Coffee Cappuccino. Just add water. A surprising 160 calories for such a tiny cup. A buck for two. Yummy!
Lunch: A can of chili for a loonie. Not bad, but tastes watery. With 740 mg of sodium, it's 31 per cent of recommended daily value.
On the side I break out some Portuguese bruschetta sticks, 18 mini slices for $2. Sort of like Melba toast with “real” oregano and olive oil.
Dinner: Chow mein for two bucks? Count me in.
It's ready in three minutes and the fork is included!
Ingredients include flour, water, salt, garlic chestnuts and bamboo shoots.
The picture on the box looks great. Inside, there is a foil pouch with toppings and a plastic pouch with noodles.
The toppings look nothing like the picture. More like a salty brown gravy sludge. The noodles taste like Play Doh.
I offer it to my wife, Sharon. “Seriously, I'm going to throw up,” she says.
I guess that was a no.
I'm still hungry. I have a $2 American tuna salad with potatoes as a side. But that tiny 240-gram plastic container holds 1.9 grams of salt, or 80 per cent of the recommended daily intake. The chow mein is relatively benign in comparison with 950 milligrams or about 40 per cent of the recommended intake.
“You have to watch the sodium. That's the real killer,” says dietitian Springle.
Yeah, but it's ready in three minutes and comes with its own fork. What's not to like?
TUESDAY
Breakfast: Mini muffins, 12 for $2. This time I'm treating myself to a french vanilla cappuccino. Even comes with a stir stick. They think of everything.
Dinner: Artificially flavoured ranch and bacon pasta salad for $1.25.
The package suggests adding chicken, roast beef or ham. I throw in some canned meatballs. Not bad.
I settle in to watch Bachelor Pad. Bad reality TV and packaged food go great together. God, Jake Pavelka is a clueless tool. Vienna is a witch. I can feel my blood pressure rising. Maybe hypertension from all this salt I'm loading up on?
Note to self: Wife already wants to kill me. We haven't had a decent meal and there's still five days to go.
WEDNESDAY:
Breakfast: Skipping the coffee. This time soothing Dollarama green tea. I'm indulging in some butterfly cookies, about 18 of them for $1.25.
They're not bad, but a serving of just two cookies equals almost a quarter of my saturated fat intake at 2 grams. It also has 5 grams of trans fat.
Springle says trans fats are the devil. She suggests 2 grams max.
I forget to tell her that I have already eaten eight of them.
Lunch: Primo hearty chicken soup with 35 per cent less sodium than its previous version. That rings in at “only 26 per cent” of my recommended daily allowance. No complaints thought for $1.25.
Dinner: The $1 gravy and meatballs looks suspiciously like Alpo. However, it goes well with some decent Dollarama bread, canned corn niblets and more of that yummy bruschetta.
I put a white tablecloth on the dining room table and light some candles. I use the good china. Maybe Sharon will feel the romance.
THURSDAY:
The Dollarama in downtown Toronto's Moss Park neighbourhood is in one of the more destitute areas of the city. About a third of households are designated low income.
Here you become acutely aware that while I'm eating Dollarama food for a week, some people have no other choice. Or some are lucky if they can afford Dollarama at all.
Dylan, a 32-year-old panhandler on the sidewalk, says he sometimes goes in for a treat when he's got enough in the orange plastic beach pail he uses to solicit loose change.
“I like their biscuits and chocolate bars, but I'd rather go to Tim Hortons for real food,” he says.
I'm trying to concentrate on what he's saying, but after four days on the diet I'm feeling lethargic. I also have a hard time focusing.
I apologize to Dylan, but he seems to know what I need. A power drink from Dollarama.
“Picks you up good,” he said.
I buy something called RAGE, one for me, and one for Dylan.
That does the trick. But my cranky level is up tenfold.
Before I leave, I load Dylan up with a Dollarama care package of snacks and prepared meals.
I don't smoke, but I feel the need to bond with another diner. I reach into my pocket and give him a pack of my favourite Popeye Candy Sticks, the ones that taste like chalk and have zero nutritional value. I can only seem to find them at Dollarama.
“For the road,” I tell him.
Lunch: A tuna snack for $1.25 and a seafood salad Niçoise for $2 (why does everything sound better in French?).
Dinner: Teriyaki Sesame Noodles for $1.50. Better than the chow mein. But eating a bowl of Lego would be better than the chow mein.
FRIDAY:
A co-worker is eating a peach. The smell is intoxicating. That peach is talking to me. I could maybe take a bite when she puts it down on her desk.
Dinner: I can't remember. Something in a package. I think it was pad Thai.
Note to self: There is no such thing as good pad Thai for $2.
Sharon is eating a spinach salad. So much for team spirit. She says I'm getting cranky and moody eating all of this processed food.
“I wouldn't eat your stupid salad if you offered it to me,” I tell her.
“You're stupid,” she says.
“No, you're stupid,” I reply as I plow into my Mr. Moo Chips ‘N Cheese Ready To Eat Fun Snack.
SATURDAY:
Breakfast: Sweet Shack pancake mix for $1.50. The picture shows strawberries on top. Dollarama mixed fruit does the trick for a buck, doused in pancake syrup. The mix is made in Germany for Dollarama. It's edible, but I think the Germans definitely make better cars.
Beverage: Wild harvest berry wine cooler with 0.5 per cent alcohol for a buck. I wish I had discovered this earlier.
Dinner: It's spaghetti for a loonie, mixed with Dollarama hearty spaghetti sauce and tinned mushrooms. Thumbs up — the sauce is flavourful and the pasta is firm and a little chewy.
But despite the fibre in the noodles, my bowels are completely blocked. Springle warned me that a lack of fibre means that you can lock up at any time.
Note to Dollarama: Stock Metamucil. You'll make a killing.
SUNDAY: My last day on the Dollarama diet. I'm constipated, I have trouble concentrating, and I'm cranky.
Note to self: Must cut back on that RAGE stuff.
Breakfast: Dollarama whole wheat bread and marmalade chased down by soy milk.
Dinner: Tonight I decide to “make” a pizza for my wife as a special treat.
For a toonie I get a pizza starter kit made from “Canadian prairie wheat and filtered water” which comes complete with tomato sauce. I toss the ready-made pie in the air. I feel like I'm actually making something.
For toppings I put on some Dollarama chopped garlic, tinned mushrooms, and a $1 tin of escargot. Who would think you can get escargot for a buck? Voila. Gourmet pizza in 10 minutes.
Sharon, grimacing at a sea of $1 slugs on her pizza, bravely takes a bite: “Not bad, I think.”
Winner, winner, pizza dinner!
Dessert: Flan cake for $1.50 topped with canned peaches and mandarin oranges. A home run.
Happy note to self: I now have so many preservatives in my system that if they buried me tomorrow my corpse wouldn't age.
EPILOGUE
After a week, 21 ready-to-eat “meals” and thousands of calories later, I have learned that you can eat with variety on the Dollarama diet, and survive. There are avid shoppers who buy dollar-store food regularly because that's all they can afford. There are others who do so because they feel they're getting value.
A lot of the food is good, but some of it is plain awful.
If you're looking for bargains, other discounters such as No Frills and Price Chopper offer great dollar deals as well — Dollarama doesn't have a monopoly on value.
I am amazed at what you can get for a buck or two — but it's probably a good idea to throw in the odd fresh fruit and vegetable.
Now, for the love of god, where's that peach?
Chip flix clicks with Dollarama COO
Stephane Gonthier is one of the few people who have likely eaten more Dollarama food than I have.
His favourite item is the Chip-Flix salt and vinegar. The chief operating officer of the Montreal-based chain also likes the canned mandarin oranges and swears by the $2 risotto from Italy.
He's also visited the Ontario plant that makes the $2 pizza kit that I made for dinner.
“It's very good, I've tried it myself,” said Gonthier.
He says people are sometimes surprised at the extent of food carried by the chain. But what about the stigma associated with eating food from a dollar store?
“We are confident and happy about the quality of our products,” says Gonthier. “We have always been highly concerned with product safety and we have adopted very strict guidelines to ensure food quality.”
While Dollarama is the largest dollar-store operator in the country with close to 667 locations, Gonthier says the company has no plans to expand into a full-fledged food retailer.
So don't expect a fresh fruit or produce department anytime soon.
But as the company's stores have gotten larger, to the average 10,000-square-foot range, the food aisles have also grown and gained in popularity, said Gonthier.
What I did notice is that the dollar store cuts across all demographic levels. Gonthier says shoppers come for value — and even the wealthy like to save a buck. But I bet they still take a pass on a second purchase of the pad Thai.
Independent TD Mick Wallace has said the latest comments from the Minister for Justice in the penalty points row were made in an effort to discredit him.
In a statement this morning, the Wexford TD repeated that he was unaware of the alleged incident in which Alan Shatter claimed he had received a garda warning for using his mobile phone while driving.
Mr Shatter said last night that his remarks about Mr Wallace were made because he believed it was important that the public were in a position to assess the credibility of Mr Wallace's position.
Mr Wallace also said the minister was hugely concerned with the protection of the reputation of celebrities and judges, but appears to be less concerned about the release of data when it serves him a political purpose.
He said he intends to continue to pursue the issue in spite of the minister's repeated efforts to discredit him and to deflect attention from other serious issues.
The Wexford TD said he will be holding a press conference next week with fellow TDs Clare Daly, Joan Collins and Luke 'Ming' Flanagan.
Fianna Fáil has called on Mr Shatter to resign, while Sinn Féin questioned whether he had acted appropriately.
General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors John Redmond said it was unbecoming of the minister to put the information into the public domain.
Labour TD Kevin Humphreys has put down Dáil questions on the matter and criticised Mr Shatter's comments.
Idina Menzel, the actress who voices Elsa in Disney's "Frozen," voiced her support for the online campaign to give the Ice Queen a girlfriend in the upcoming sequel, according to Entertainment Tonight.
Stopped on the red carpet at Sunday's Billboard Music Awards, Menzel said the online campaign is "great" and that it's up to Disney to figure out the details. Either way, she says she loves the character and she'll continue to embrace her.
The #GiveElsaAGirlfriend movement started late last month when activist Alexis Isabel tweeted the hashtag at Disney. Thousands of people retweeted Isabel and the movement spread from there.
Disney hasn't given an official statement on whether or not they plan for Elsa to be a lesbian, but we do know Menzel will continue to play the role of Elsa alongside Kristen Bell as Anna and the movie won't be out before 2018.

Terry Collins said he does not expect Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom to have any pitch count or innings restrictions this season.
"Fortunately, we're not going to have to worry about innings this year," Collins said this past weekend, according to MLB.com (Jan. 18, 2016). "I think we're always going to be concerned with workload. These guys are still young and we don't want them to get hurt. We're going to be careful in Spring Training, bring them along a little slowly. I've done a lot of research of some of these teams in the past that have had young pitchers. One of the things I've learned is that you've got to be careful early in the year. If you're planning on having them pitch in October, then they have to be ready."
Zack Wheeler is expected to join the rotation in June or July as he works to return from Tommy John surgery.
"He looks tremendous," Collins said about Wheeler. "He's in St. Lucie now. He's throwing. He realizes it's going to be a couple of months before he's ready to go. That's why we got Bartolo Colon back."
The Mets starting pitchers were fourth in the National League with a 3.44 ERA last season, while leading the league with 1002 innings pitched.
"With our pitching staff, if we score a few runs, we'll have a good chance to win," Collins concluded. "We were very, very proud of the way our team played last year. We just didn't finish it off. Hopefully, we're going to get another chance."
Pence, 57, a lawyer and a former talk radio host, was not deeply involved in military affairs during his 12 years in Congress. | AP Photo Pence could undermine key Trump war argument
A year ago, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence suggested in a major speech that 2016 “could actually be the first foreign policy national election since 1980.”
Now emerging as Donald Trump's likely vice presidential pick, the Republican governor could end up undermining one of Trump's key foreign policy arguments against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton — her vote as a senator in 2002 for the Iraq War.
Story Continued Below
Just like Clinton, Pence, who represented a swath of eastern Indiana in the U.S. House from 2001 to 2013, voted for the 2002 resolution to authorize George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, now widely considered a major blunder that destabilized the region and required a huge commitment of U.S. blood and treasure.
As a congressman, Pence was a leading supporter of the war, continuing to staunchly defend it even after things went south. And some of his past statements on Iraq amount to pretty much the opposite of the views Trump is now pushing.
In 2008, he included an entire page on his congressional website devoted to defending the war, calling the capture of Saddam Hussein “a victory of incalculable value to the security and freedom of the Iraqi people.”
“By ignoring President Bush's ultimatum to leave Iraq, Saddam Hussein exhausted his final opportunity to avoid removal by force,” said Pence's website, which has since been taken down. “Military engagement became necessary to prevent Hussein from threatening the United States and its allies.”
Earlier this month, though, Trump lamented the death of the former Iraqi leader, saying that while he was a “really bad guy,” Hussein did manage to keep Iraq secure from the terrorist groups that have since taken control of wide swaths of territory.
“He killed terrorists,” Trump said of the late dictator at a rally in North Carolina. “He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over.”
“Today,” Trump added, “Iraq is Harvard for terrorism."
Trump has maintained on the campaign trail that he opposed the Iraq War from the start — an attack line that was effective against Jeb Bush and that he's now using against Clinton, despite the fact that it has since come to light that Trump said in 2002 that he supported the invasion, as FactCheck.org and other sites have pointed out.
Trump's likely pick of Pence as his running mate could make this attack line even more difficult to sustain.
Pence, 57, a lawyer and a former talk radio host, was not deeply involved in military affairs during his 12 years in Congress. He's not a veteran and didn't serve on the House Armed Services Committee. He was a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee and did travel to Iraq and Afghanistan, among other places.
In one highly publicized incident, he was part of a 2007 congressional delegation led by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to an Iraqi market. Members of Congress declared the market was safe and evidence of an improved security situation in Iraq, with Pence saying it was "like a normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime."
But they were widely mocked after The New York Times reported on the extraordinary security measures in place for the lawmakers' visit, including more than 100 soldiers, sharpshooters on rooftops and attack helicopters overhead.
Pence's disagreements with Trump on defense issues go beyond the Iraq War. In a speech last year to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Pence laid out a hawkish foreign policy vision that offers a stark contrast to Trump's more isolationist views.
Pence then decried Russia's increasingly aggressive behavior, saying a “new Iron Curtain is descending down the spine of Europe.” And he said the Pentagon budget should be "dramatically" increased.
The governor also called for reviving two weapons programs that have become emblems for the kind of military waste Trump has said should be cut.
The Army's Future Combat Systems and the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet were both scuttled early in the Obama administration. The F-22 was canceled after just 195 jets had rolled off the assembly line, far below the 750 the Air Force had originally planned to buy.
Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates' decision to scrap the F-22 was in part the result of major cost overruns.
Restarting the production line, according to a Congressional Research Service report, could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
An American held by al-Qaida for four years, and two other U.S. citizens who fought for the terror group, were killed in U.S. military strikes in January along the Afghan-Pakistan border, the U.S. government acknowledged for the first time Thursday. An Italian citizen held hostage since 2012 was also killed in one of the strikes on an al-Qaida compound.
President Obama said he has launched a full review of the military operations that led to the deaths. “We will identify the lessons we can learn from this tragedy. We will do our utmost to ensure it will not be repeated,” he said in a televised statement at the White House.

In all, seven Americans have been killed in drone strikes, six of them not directly targeted, according to NBC News.
The surprise announcement revealed that Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old U.S. aid worker who was kidnapped in Pakistan in 2011 and pleaded for his life in a video released by the group, was killed in January in a U.S. drone strike. According to a statement from White House spokesman Josh Earnest, Weinstein was killed along with Ahmed Farouq, a U.S. citizen and al-Qaida fighter. Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian humanitarian worker who was kidnapped in 2012, was also killed in that strike. A separate strike, also in January, killed Adam Gadahn, a long-sought American who worked for al-Qaida and was on the FBI's most-wanted list. Earnest said later that Gadahn was “not specifically targeted” in the strike that ultimately killed him.
“I profoundly regret what happened,” Obama said of the deaths of the hostages. “On behalf of the U.S. government I offer my deepest apologies to the families.” Obama said he spoke Wednesday with Weinstein's wife and with the prime minister of Italy. “As president and as commander in chief, I take full responsibility for all our counterterrorism operations,” the president said.
Warren Weinstein's wife, Elaine, said that the family is “devastated” by the knowledge that he won't be coming home. ”The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions,” she said in a written statement.
In December 2013, al-Qaida released a video of Warren Weinstein, looking haggard and afraid, pleading directly with Obama to negotiate his release.
Weinstein blamed Pakistan, not the U.S. for her husband's death, lamenting that “Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority.” But she also said the United States's work to recover her husband was “inconsistent and disappointing” over the course of his captivity.
“Our hearts go out to the families of Dr. Warren Weinstein, an American held by al-Qaida since 2011, and Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian national who had been an al-Qa'ida hostage since 2012. Analysis of all available information has led the Intelligence Community to judge with high confidence that the operation accidentally killed both hostages,” Earnest said in a statement.
“The operation targeted an al-Qa'ida-associated compound, where we had no reason to believe either hostage was present, located in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan. No words can fully express our regret over this terrible tragedy,” Earnest added.
During a live briefing Thursday afternoon at the White House, Earnest said the families of Weinstein and Lo Porto will be compensated. Earnest said there were significant U.S. resources aimed at finding Weinstein and rescuing him, and Obama was regularly briefed on the effort. Earnest also said that Obama “didn't specifically sign off” on the two drone strikes that led to the deaths.
A senior Defense Department official told NBC News' Richard Engel that U.S. special forces did not attempt to rescue the hostages because there wasn't enough information about their location. “There was no starting point, no idea where to recover them. Until you can get a single starting point, you can't start searching in the middle of the ocean,” the official said.
The deaths of the hostages are likely to raise serious questions about the U.S. intelligence community's role in the prosecution of counterterrorism operations and the military's use of drones. Under Obama, the use of drones in fighting the war on terror has increased many-fold, despite increased criticism from human rights groups, lawmakers and others concerned with the ethical implications of the pilotless weapons.
Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Commmittee, told msnbc's Andrea Mitchell that the strikes revealed Thursday raise serious questions about American drone strikes, adding that he has not been briefed by the Obama administration about the January strikes.
“I do think in the longer term we've got some important work that's gone undone on the Foreign Relations Committee to create the strategic, the moral, the legal framework for our use of drones going into the future.”
“We need to revisit the core question: How are they authorized, where are they appropriate and how do we deal with unitended consequences?” the senator added.
California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she and her colleagues have begun reviewing the January military operation. “We should also again review all procedures and safeguards to make sure every measure is taken to prevent the deaths of innocent civilians,” she said in a statement.
The president has tried for years to help right an intelligence agency scarred and diminished by failings that date back to the first al-Qaida strikes on U.S. soil in 2001. Successive bipartisan and independent reviews found that the CIA and other agencies had missed key markers of al-Qaida's intentions. Failings continued through the lead up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Eventually, the CIA was exposed for running secret overseas prisons, torturing suspects and destroying evidence of its actions. Obama closed many of those programs, and turned the drones program over to the military, which continued to ramp up its use. But the president has also secretly approved kill lists that include U.S. citizens who became al-Qaida leaders. Anwar al-Alawki, an American Muslim, was killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011 after the United States determined he was directing plots against the United States, including an attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner in flight.
The intelligence community has worked to improve its reputation and was championed for its role in the nighttime raid inside Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. But the CIA and the Pentagon have struggled with how to deal with U.S. citizens held hostage around the world. Three Americans have been beheaded by Islamic militants in the Middle East.
“Today's disclosures just raise new questions about the reliability and depth of the intelligence the government is relying on,” Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told msnbc. “The government literally didn't know who it was killing.”
Jaffer added that it is not clear who the U.S. was targeting in the strikes it disclosed Thursday. ”The larger point is that there's still a lot of information we don't have about who's being killed and why they're being killed,” Jaffer said.
In a separate written statement, Jaffer added, “These and other recent strikes in which civilians were killed make clear that there is a significant gap between the relatively stringent standards the government says it's using and the standards that are actually being used. It would of course be easier to assess this gap if the government routinely released information about individual drone strikes. Unfortunately, the president's stated commitment to transparency can't be squared with the secrecy that still shrouds virtually every aspect of the government's drone program.”
Mustafa Qadri, a researcher with Amnesty International and an expert on the American drone program, called Obama's public acknowledgement of the drone strikes “unprecedented.”
“This is an opportunity now for President Obama to be much more open and transparent about the drone program,” he told msnbc. “I hope it's the first of many disclosures” not just of Americans who are killed in drone strikes but “all cases where the U.S. believes it has killed civilians.”
Qadri also said many questions remain about the United States' legal basis for carrying out drone strikes, adding, “we have very serious concerns that the U.S. is not using drones in a lawful way.” Still, he said he believes Obama's announcement was a “watershed moment” that he hopes will pave the way to more disclosure. “In a way, [Obama has] broken the ice. Let's find out more.”
Gadahn, the son of a California goat herder, converted to Islam at a young age and left the United States in 1998, according to NBC News. The 36-year-old attended al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan and became a translator for the terror group. He was indicted in California for treason and supporting terrorism. Gadahn's profile rose after bin Laden's death, when it was discovered that Gadahn regularly corresponded with the late al-Qaida leader. But Gadahn was seen by some al-Qaida members as lacking religious credibility and battleground experience.
Gadahn was an associate of senior al-Qaida leader Abu Zubaydah. Zubaydah who is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was one of three al-Qaida leaders who was subject to waterboarding by the CIA.
Cameron: One time, we had an appearance. I came back [to the hotel] and I remember seeing like a mousetrap. Like one of those sticky kinds. There was a piece of candy wrapper [stuck to it]. I'm like, "Hm, I don't remember that being there." So the night I come back after SmackDown!, after we had the taping, I was just laying in the bed and all of a sudden I just see a mouse just run by and go in the bathroom. And I was so disgusted, because I was like, "Okay, that means the hotel had to have known that was there." Because there was a trap! And I was so scared after that. I moved rooms and I was scared to put my feet down [on the ground].
The Miz: I checked into a hotel that ... in the doorway, you could see [people] sleeping in the next room. And the [employees] came out, gave me the key to the room, which was like an actual key, not one of those little plastic card things that we get nowadays. I opened the door [to the room] and I didn't even want to sleep on the floor, didn't want to sleep in the bed. I didn't know where to sleep, so I slept in my car.
Titus O'Neil: The closest thing I've had, is that maybe my key doesn't work once in a while. One time my key didn't work, then I came back downstairs and they gave me a key to another room and that one didn't work. And then I find out the computer was down and they ended up putting me in a room with double beds. It was a crappy night. But I got two free nights out of it.
Goldust: I've got several, but I really shouldn't ... Okay, I'll tell you one story. It's not really a horror story. I was in Japan, and this was my first tour over there. I was there with Danny Kroffat and Doug Furnas. We were in this little bitty town in Japan -- I can't remember where it was -- but Abdullah the Butcher always sleeps with his door open. And I think it was Doug Furnas that came up with the bright idea to get me out of the room and he said, "Watch this right here, this is gonna be funny as hell." And he let the fire extinguisher go. And it was one of those that doesn't stop. And Abdullah started coughing in his room. There was white stuff all over. It was pretty cool. [Abdullah] didn't know who did it, though.
Christian: I actually had one ... It was in, I think, Biloxi, Miss., and the valet lost my rental car. I'll never forget that. I'm standing there and it's just like, "Yeah we can't find it." I'm like, "How do you lose a rental car?" Took about an hour and a half, but they finally found it. I guess they misplaced it somewhere, but it was pretty funny there for a few minutes.
Bad News Barrett: Probably the worst one was when somebody found out which hotel I was staying in and started doing very bad English accents, pretending to be related to me, trying to get into the room. Yeah, it was just a bit of a disaster.
Jim Ross: It's ranged from turning the sheets back and finding someone's ... deposit. Someone actually used the restroom in the bed and then remade the bed. And it was ... it wasn't funny. That was in [New] Jersey, I think. Then the other stuff is simple. I had a hotel room in Manchester, England, that would have been too small for Hornswoggle. I was hanging everywhere. They had a TV with a screen the size of my iPad. They had a desk, that you could work at the desk, but the room was so small, the desk didn't have room for a chair. So you had to sit on the end of the bed to reach over to your desk to do your work.
Dolph Ziggler: One time, Motel 6, but the lock had been busted off a bunch of times and it looked like they just kind of painted over it, so the door would just come right open and it was really cheap. Bad part of town, shady characters outside the window -- it's ground-floor -- doing who knows what. So I took the chair from the desk and I propped it under the door and I pushed the bed to the other side of the room and I slept sitting up with my clothes on, waiting for the door to come unjammed.
Justin Gabriel: I have a few, actually. Let's see ... the most recent one ... I don't remember the town, but I remember waking up and [I was staying in the same hotel as] Damien Sandow. He knocked on [the door to] my room in the middle of the night and he was like, "Dude, we gotta get out of here." And there was nobody checked into that hotel. And I asked the guy [working there], I was like, "Hey guy, is this hotel very popular?" And he goes, "Oh yeah, very popular. It's just out of season." It was just weird. I'm pretty sure it was haunted. Pretty sure. Empty hotel. Nobody. [Just us] and the guy at the reception.
Ricardo Rodriguez: When we run out of toilet paper! [Laughs]
WASHINGTON - Senate Republicans have blocked Democratic-backed legislation requiring organizations pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign ads to disclose their top donors and the amounts they spend.
GOP opposition prevented Democrats from getting the 60 votes needed to bring what is known as the Disclose Act to the Senate floor. The vote was 51-44.
Democrats revived the act during a presidential election campaign in which political action committees and nonprofit organizations, funded by deep-pocketed and largely anonymous contributors, are dominating the airwaves with largely negative political ads.
Another version of the Disclose Act passed the then-Democratic-controlled House in 2010 but was similarly blocked by Republicans in the Senate. Republicans cite First Amendment rights and say the bill favors unions in opposing the legislation.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused Democrats of wasting time on bills "they know won't pass but which give them a chance to make a fuss about a problem that doesn't exist and blow a kiss to the unions for good measure."
The bill, which would not have gone into effect until next January, would have required any organization that spends $10,000 or more during an election cycle to file a report within 24 hours identifying any donors who gave $10,000 or more. Current election law requires super political action committees, or PACS, to make periodic reports to the Federal Election Commission, but nonprofit groups, including social welfare organizations, labor unions and trade groups, generally do not have to reveal the sources of election-related spending.
"Perhaps Republicans want to shield the handful of billionaires willing to contribute nine figures to sway a close presidential election," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. He said this election was in danger of being bought by "17 angry, old, white men."
The White House, in a statement, said the bill was needed so Americans would "know who is attempting to influence the nation's elections." Without the bill, it said, "corporations and wealthy individuals will continue to be able to shield their donations from disclosure."
Democrats have been pushing for more disclosure since the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in the 2010 Citizens United case that overturned a decades-old law barring corporations, unions and other organizations from spending on advertising and other forms of political activity.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said super PACS and other outside groups have spent some $150 million during this election cycle, double the amount spent during the same period in 2008. Election campaigns, he said, are "now waged by shadowy political attack groups posing as social welfare organizations."
The Sunlight Foundation watchdog group said Monday that Crossroads GPS, a conservative organization formed by Republican strategist Karl Rove, has announced ad buys so far totaling $83 million while Americans for Prosperity, another conservative group founded by brothers Charles and David Koch, have bought ads worth $32 billion.
Groups such as Crossroads GPS, are classified as social welfare organizations not subject to disclosure laws as long as they spend more than half their resources toward "social welfare" purposes. But that 50 percent can go for "public education" that can be highly political in nature.
Knowing they were facing defeat, Democratic supporters announced earlier in the day that they would hold a "midnight vigil," speeches going late into the evening on the need for greater campaign transparency. "We can't let the special interests off the hook after just one round," Whitehouse said.
Monday's vote was strictly along party lines except for Reid, who changed his vote to "no" in a procedural move that allows him to bring up the legislation again on Tuesday.
Unlocking all sorts of fun stuff start happening not far into playing the new Inside Out Playset from Disney Infinity 3.0. Primarily you are treated with gorgeous concept art and the occasional imaginary bad guy, but our favorite unlock from the Inside Out Playset is without a doubt, Bing Bong's Wagon.
The first thing we did once we unlocked the wagon was hopping right into the Toy Box to test it out. Would it there be rainbows? Would there be music? Would it fly???
Unfortunately, Bing Bong's Wagon is not a flying vehicle, but no complaints from us, now we get to use it as a vehicle inside the Toy Box Speedway.
Jumping on the wagon immediately triggers an alternate soundtrack to what ever is currently playing in your Toy Box. The song wasn't anything we immediately recognized from the film, but perhaps more trained ears than ourselves might be able to pick up where it comes from (video below).
Once unlocked you can find the wagon inside the Toy Box under “Ground Vehicles”.
Here are the Toy Store details / description for Bing Bong's Wagon from the Toy Box
And to top off the overall awesomeness of this new vehicle, of course.. RAINBOWS! When you start driving the vehicle it immediately beings producing long streaming ribbons of rainbows out of each of the brooms. It makes this already great vehicle probably one of our personal favorites.
Of course we spent most of our time jumping off the side of the track to get some great photos of the Wagon with it's long rainbow trail….
So jump right into the Inside Out Playset and starting working to unlocking Bing Bong's Wagon. We apologize that we don't remember the exact feat it was that unlocked it, but we are pretty certain it was the “Shooting Star” feat (earn 8 stars).
Video
Enjoy the video of Bing Bong's Wagon in action!

This 1927 Track T “Walker Special” is a 2014 Race of Gentlemen competitor that displays some amazing craftsmanship and hot rod history. Packing a Ford V8 60 flathead and top-loader tranny from a truck, the car would look great at the local cruise, Bonneville or back on the sands in Jersey. Find it here on Jalopy Journal in Knoxville, Tennessee for $22k.
Track T's started out on dirt ovals where they quickly developed a unique look, which as seen here, translated well to the dry lakes and burgeoning hot rod scene. For this car, an original '26 or '27 Model T touring body was shortened and then narrowed by six inches. Steel was used to form the track nose, while aluminum was used for the grille insert, hood top and sides. An original Model A frame was modified to fit the body. Many original parts were included in the build, before everything was covered in period looking single stage urethane. We particularly like the Brooklands screens and sprint car style steering linkage.
Using a transverse leaf spring, the front suspension runs original '37 through '40 split wishbones and a four inch dropped and filled SuperBell axle. The rear uses '37 through '41 “Round Backs” with Juice brakes bring it to a halt. The car rolls on '39 wide five hubs, with 4.50 and 7.00-16 tires lending a nice rake. The seller notes that shackles, king pins, tie rod ends and brakes were either rebuilt or replaced.
Tradition is important at TROG, and the engine doesn't disappoint in this area. Produced by Ford from '37 through '40, the 136ci V8 60 was physically smaller than other Flathead Ford V8s, making it easier to tuck into small vehicles. Output was only 60 HP, hence the name. Never very popular with US car buyers who were used to the larger, 85 horse Ford eight, it became very popular in midget racers after WWII. This one has been bored .100 over and runs period 10:1 compression Edelbrock heads, and though the car raced with a twin carb intake, a single Ford/Holley 94 has since been fitted to make it more tractable on the street. It sounds fantastic in this video.
The tranny feeds into an open drive before heading to a “Banjo” rear with 3.54:1 gears. The seller notes that the car was built to be a finished street car, and was not thrown together. Additionally, the ad features some build pictures, but we think it looks the best salt splattered and sandy.
The easy (and nice) way to do CLI apps in Python
Thomas Stringer Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 21, 2016
There are a few ways to do the command-line app thing in Python. I've done these few ways, and some of them have their pain-points and annoyances. So I reached out to the community to find what the better way is (I hate to say “best”, as possibly there is something that is better than this).
What is a CLI?
“CLI” stands for “command line interface”. It's a type of application that is invoked through the command-line/terminal/shell/whatever. As a developer, power user, and a generally “more keyboard, less mouse” type of person, I use CLI apps all the time. And when I need to write some custom software for myself, oftentimes the CLI fits my needs. And Python is a great language to churn out a quick CLI app.
Filesystem structure
Here is my basic filesystem structure…
pycli/
├── README.md
├── install.sh
├── pycli
├── __init__.py
├── __main__.py
├── classmodule.py
└── funcmodule.py
└── setup.py
As you can see above, I name the root directory of the CLI project to be whatever I want the CLI to be called (in this example case, the CLI is called and invoked by pycli ).
CLI sub directory
As you can see, there is only a single sub directory in the root CLI folder. I name it the same as the CLI app, but in more complex CLIs you may have multiple packages. Each of the sub directories would be the containers of each package. In my simple case (and for most of my CLIs) there is only a single package, which translates to a single sub directory. In this example, it is also named pycli/ .
__init__.py
This file (empty) is there to tell Python that directory contains a package. That's it. It could be empty just to have the simple indication, or it could have actual code that will run during initialization of the package itself.
__main__.py
This is an important one. It's our entry point for the CLI, which will be indicated by our setup configuration in setup.py in the root directory. I have just some simple code here to show that “it works”.
import sys
from .classmodule import MyClass
from .funcmodule import my_function
def main():
print('in main')
args = sys.argv[1:]
print('count of args :: {}'.format(len(args)))
for arg in args:
print('passed argument :: {}'.format(arg))
my_function('hello world')
my_object = MyClass('Thomas')
my_object.say_name()
if __name__ == '__main__':
main()
All this does is import a few other modules (see below), parse args passed to the CLI, and implements those imported module members (a simple function and a simple class).
classmodule.py
An extremely simple (useless) class that is imported into __main__.py and instantiated there. Again, this is just to show the how of importing a class from a module in the same package.
class MyClass():
def __init__(self, name):
self.name = name
def say_name(self):
print('name is {}'.format(self.name))
funcmodule.py
Whereas classmodule.py shows how to define a class for __main__.py to import, funcmodule.py shows how to define a simple (useless) function that __main__.py can import and invoke.
def my_function(text_to_display):
print('text from my_function :: {}'.format(text_to_display))
setup.py
Now back out to the root directory of the CLI source code. The setup.py file is what ties it all together and tells Python how to handle it.
from setuptools import setup
setup(
name = 'pycli',
version = '0.1.0',
packages = ['pycli'],
entry_points = {
'console_scripts': [
'pycli = pycli.__main__:main'
]
})
At first glance, this may look complicated. But all we're doing here is importing the setup function from the setuptools package and calling it with a few parameters. Most of those will be self-explanatory. The packages argument is just a list that indicates all of the include packages. If you recall from above, this CLI has a single package also named pycli .
entry_points is the important part here. It's what indicates (with a string) what the runnable application will be called, and when run what exactly should be invoked. Here it says pycli = pycli.__main__:main . That might look really confusing, but here's how this translates: “the runnable will be called pycli , and when executed it will run the main function in the __main__ module which is part of the pycli package. That's it!
install.sh
The best way to install (and uninstall) your Python CLI app is to use pip (pip3 for Python 3). In the root directory of the CLI source code, running pip3 install . will install this app using setup.py as “instructions”. Likewise, running pip3 uninstall pycli will remove the app.
I decided to put this logic in a shell script so that I didn't have to always manually type out these commands (which gets very tedious when you are actively developing a CLI app). So I dump it all in a shell script.
pip3 install -e .
Now all I have to do is run install.sh to “recycle” the CLI on my machine with current source code.
Note: Thanks for all the suggestions on making this a better install script with the -e switch!
Summary
For me, CLI apps are absolutely crucial. And Python makes it a breeze to write the code for them. With this approach I've found an easy way to write these types of apps… quickly. For reference source code on a simple CLI app in Python check out the accompanying repository on GitHub.
For Najib Razak, the Malaysian prime minister beset by controversy over nearly £450 million paid into his personal bank account, the timing of a global anti-corruption conference in Kuala Lumpur next week could not be more awkward.
The embattled leader has now quietly cancelled his scheduled speech to 2,000 delegates on the opening day of the International Anti-Corruption Conference that his country is hosting.
The summit, which is organised by the Transparency International, the world's leading anti-corruption organisation, is held every two years in different locations.
By chance, it will open in Kuala Lumpur as Mr Najib's government is engulfed in allegations of corruption and financial impropriety surrounding 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a scandal-plagued state investment fund.
The prime minister has strenuously denied any wrongdoing connected to the payments into his bank account or to 1MDB, which that has amassed debts of £7 billion since he founded it in 2009.
The prospect of the prime minister addressing the conference had delighted critics who are demanding his resignation.
His office has not explained why he is now sending along a junior minister in his place.
“It's standard protocol of the International Anti-Corruption Conference to have the democratically elected head of state open the conference,” said Chris Sanders, Transparency International's spokesman.
“His appearance would have provided an opportunity for the global anti-corruption community and Malaysian civil society, and media, to question the prime minister directly at the conference about the 1MDB affair and other recent events.”
Mr Najib pulled out of the summit as tens of thousands of protestors prepare to stage anti-Najib rallies in Malaysian cities this weekend. The protests are going ahead despite threats by police to arrest organisers as the gatherings do not have permits.
The scandal swirling around 1MDB took a new twist last month when it was reported that financial investigators had found a payment of nearly £450m into Mr Najib's bank accounts.
The country's anti-corruption commission said that the money was contributed by an unnamed donor, not by 1MDB, but officials said they were still investigating.
Mr Najib's officials have said that the payment of nearly £450m, made through an Arab bank, came from a Middle East benefactor for political party use purposes before the last election. Mr Najib has denied any personal financial gain.
But the contribution of such a large sum – nearly as much as the £470m raised by Barack Obama to fight the 2012 US presidential campaign in the most expensive election in history – has only fuelled controversies.
Mahathir Mohamad, the former Malaysian prime minister who was once Mr Najob's mentor, has been among the most vocal critics questioning the donation and leading calls for his resignation.

Mr Najib has accused Mr Mahathir of leading a conspiracy to oust him. His government has also said it is the target of a plot involving Clare Rewcastle Brown, the sister-in-law of Gordon Brown, who runs Sarawak Report, a London-based anti-corruption website.
As the scandals deepened, Mr Najib sacked his deputy prime minister and other Cabinet members who did not stick to the party line and replaced key anti-corruption officials.
With his government battered at the same time by economic woes as falling oil prices have pushed the ringgit currency to a 17-year-low, there has also been a crackdown on opposition media.
Malaysia on Thursday announced that it will block websites supplying information about and encouraging participation in the the protest rallies. The home minister had earlier said that the organisers from pro-democracy group Bersih were spreading "anti-government propaganda" that damaged the country's image and hence was a threat to national stability.
Parole applicants forced to give 'closure' to crime victims in South Australian legislative reform
Updated
Prisoners on life sentences in relation to murder who refuse to reveal the location of bodies will be denied parole under new reforms passed by the South Australian Government.
Those who do achieve parole will be subjected to parole conditions for the rest of their lives, with the Parole Board "compelled" to consider electronic monitoring, including via GPS.
SA Correctional Services Minister Tony Piccolo said the changes provided a fairer process and better supported victims' families, especially those in murder cases where a body had not been found.
"If the body is not located, or in the case where there are known associates to that crime, if the prisoner does not cooperate with police to either help identify the location of the body, or the associates, they'll be ineligible for parole," he said.
"These laws are much tougher and that's designed clearly to support the families of the victims of crime, to help them get closure."
The reforms have also removed the Government's ability to veto parole board decisions on murderers and will create a new body to review parole decisions.
It marks a departure from Government intervention in judicial decisions, which became a hallmark of former premier Mike Rann and treasurer Kevin Foley in an era when the Government wielded a tough arm on law and order.
Mr Piccolo said removing political interference from the parole process was important.
"It's important that the process is seen to be fair. This process is transparent. It's fairer, and importantly [it's] certainly not a weakening of the law," he said.
The reforms passed the Legislative Council unamended and are expected to come into effect later this year.

How a power station sold for peanuts became a $730 million asset
Updated
It might rank as the deal of the century — but an appalling result for New South Wales taxpayers.
In November 2015, the NSW Government offloaded Vales Point Power Station — an old, polluting coal-fired plant on the shores of Lake Macquarie — for $1 million.
Suburban homes sell for more.
A former energy industry bureaucrat and a coal baron bought Vales Point at the fire sale price through their company, Sunset Power International.
Last week, as politicians loudly debated the latest energy plan to come out of Canberra, Sunset Power quietly released its latest financial reports — revaluing the Vales Point Power Plant at a cool $730 million.
The shareholders, who lent Sunset Power the money to buy the old power plant, pocketed nearly $40 million through a share buy-back by the now cashed-up company.
Nice work if you can get it.
Who are the lucky shareholders?
The shareholders are companies associated with Trevor St Baker, an energy industry veteran and former engineer with the NSW and Queensland electricity commissions, and Brian Flannery, a BRW rich-lister who owns a suite of mining, energy, and property assets.
For Mr St Baker, there are some wonderful synergies.
He controls more than 25 per cent of the ASX-listed ERM Power Limited, which purchases power under contract from Vales Point.
In turn, ERM has contracts to supply the NSW Government with electricity.
The changing fortunes of Vales Point Power Station is, on one level, an illustration of how Australia's energy policy chaos is creating unlikely winners and losers.
Back in 2015, the State Government considered the old coal-fired power plant near worthless: unable to compete with either cheaper brown coal-generated electricity from Victoria or the growing supply from renewable energy.
As the State Government was shopping it around for sale, the "useful life" of the Vale Point Power Station was reassessed.
Despite its technical closure date of 2029, the State Government slated it for closure in 2021 — resulting in a $371 million write-down.
When it was finally sold, after struggling to find a buyer, the then-NSW treasurer Gladys Berejiklian issued a media release which said the $1 million price tag was "above its retention value".
Selling Vales Point would rescue the taxpayer from "ongoing losses" and exposure "to significant liabilities, such as costs associated with decommissioning, estimated to be in the tens of millions", she claimed.
Two years on, how different things are — wholesale electricity prices have soared.
The changing energy landscape
Over the past year, Vale Points' owners gained $380 million from electricity sales from the power station, compared to $270 million for energy generated during its last full year of state ownership.
The closure of the Hazelwood Power Plant in Victoria has tightened the market.
Victoria's decision to subsidise the continued operation of the energy-intensive Portland Aluminium Smelter has bolstered demand.
Gas prices have soared, as much of Australia's gas gets sent offshore, making coal-fired power more competitive.
Perhaps most critically, continued uncertainty about Australia's energy policy — and the Federal Government's perceived hostility to clean energy — has curtailed the amount of new generation capacity coming onto the market.
The new owners of Vales Point Power Station say they have no intention of closing it in four years' time.
Sunset Power sees the "useful life" of the old coal-burning power plant extending to at least 2029, and possibly beyond.
That's one of the reasons for the massive hike in its book value.
Some might quibble at the $730 million valuation for the station.
One analyst we spoke to said that cost of decommissioning and rehabilitating the site of the ageing unit might be in the hundreds of millions, not tens of millions, and this did not appear to be factored in.
But the days of decommissioning could be a long way off if the Federal Government's New Energy Guarantee is enacted, forcing electricity retailers and large users to enter contracts for "dispatchable energy" from gas and coal.
Great news for Mr St Baker and Mr Flannery; it looks as if they made a shrewd bet and got the power station for a steal.
Coal's fortunes reversed
For those who believe we should be shifting away from polluting fossil-fuel sources of energy, it's not such a good outcome.
In 2015/16, it was responsible for 11.4 per cent of the large-scale electricity generation in NSW, producing nearly 7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions — a cause of global warming — in the process.
"This is a stark example of the consequences of Australia's broken energy policies," said Adam Walters, research director at Energy & Resource Insights.
"Years of chaos has led to a chronic lack of long-term planning and delayed investment in new renewable capacity.
"As a result, supply tightened so much in the wake of Hazelwood's closure that windfall profits have been delivered to highly polluting coal power stations.
"Australia's self-sabotaging approach to gas exports hasn't helped either."
Maybe the NSW Government's decision to sell the ageing asset was a little hasty.
Despite the climate science, and the Paris accord, the days of coal-fired power aren't done.

We stood on the castle ramparts, pointing our cameras at one another. There was nothing to say. Waves pounded and churned against the seawall below; the fishing boats pitched sideways as they set out beneath somber skies. A blanket of clouds stretched toward the horizon, sitting low over an ocean that looked like freshly poured cement.
The grayness of sea and sky matched our mood. Just a few minutes before, our tour group had descended the long, dimly lit passageway into the underbelly of Ghana's Cape Coast Castle, to the dungeons through which countless thousands of male slaves had once passed. The damp darkness, the memory of the evils committed in those cramped quarters, weighed heavily upon us. When we ascended again into the courtyard, the fresh sea air felt impossibly light. We circled the flagstones like gulls.
It was a sobering introduction to Ghana, whose slave-trading past has left an indelible mark on both sides of the Atlantic: helping to build the wealth of the New World while rupturing kinship ties across Africa and robbing the continent of perhaps more than 20 million of its sons and daughters. Yet while slavery is a solemn reference point for the country itself, it has become a springboard for tourists to this West African nation, who come not only to steep themselves in the sins of the past but also to explore one of the continent's most welcoming countries — a friendly, free-spirited nation blessed with more than 300 miles of tropical coastline stretching along the Gulf of Guinea.
For centuries, that same coast was a motley bazaar of forts and trading posts manned, at different points, by most of Europe's great maritime powers. Cape Coast, a roughly three-hour drive west of the capital, Accra, was the most prominent of the settlements, serving for nearly two centuries as the administrative center of Britain's Gold Coast colony. The town was built along a gently sloping hill, rising from the choppy waters over which the whitewashed walls of Cape Coast Castle stand like a gigantic tombstone.
From a distance, the castle looks forbidding, but those imposing ramparts and seaward-facing cannons were a bold bluff by the British. For most of their tenancy, the castle was poorly fortified and undermanned; despite the military bluster, wrote William St. Clair in “The Door of No Return,” Cape Coast Castle was little more than a “defended warehouse,” its storage rooms packed with rifles and gunpowder, its dungeons with the human chattel that, like the rest of the cargo, had been insured by thoughtful agents in London or Liverpool.
Descending again, we were taken to the two dungeons where women were held before being led out through the infamous Door of No Return. Outside, small boats would wait in the shallow harbor to take them to the slave ships; for most, this was the last time their feet would touch African soil. Taking those same steps ourselves, we had reached the emotional climax of the tour. But there was no time for reflection, for the scene outside was jarring: Beside the castle is Cape Coast's port, and the place was unhinged, all color and clamor, cacophonous with the cries of market women and fishermen. A forest of masts flew the flags of Ghana and Germany and Israel and Spain. The guide was trying to say something, but it was impossible to hear him over the din.
Turning back, he brought our attention to a sign posted over the entrance: “Door of Return.” The Ministry of Tourism and Diasporan Relations placed it there as a symbolic welcome to the millions of slave descendants living abroad. Many, the government hopes, will return to Ghana — whether for a visit to discover their roots or to plant those roots anew and call the country home.
In the bookshop, some thoughtful entrepreneur had put together a slender tome for such returnees: “Points to Ponder: A Travel Guide When Considering Repatriating Home to Mother Africa/Ghana to Live or to Visit.” A half-dozen copies sat on the counter, their corners sharp, their spines stiff, looking very much untouched and unpondered.
There's an oft-told story in Ghana — perhaps apocryphal, perhaps not entirely — of Richard Nixon's visit as vice president in 1957, during the newly born nation's independence celebrations. Turning to a group of revelers drunk on the emotions of the day, Nixon asked, “How does it feel to be free?”
“We wouldn't know,” came the reply. “We're from Alabama.”
In the 1950s and '60s, Ghana was at the heart of Africa's independence movement, a conflagration lit by the pan-Africanist ideology of Kwame Nkrumah, the country's first prime minister and later president. But America and African Americans played an important role in shaping the era's identity. Nkrumah was a graduate of Lincoln University, a historically black college in Pennsylvania, and his time there had provided him with a valuable schooling in life as a black man in America. Years later, in 1953, he drew a direct line between his country's independence movement and the civil rights struggle in the United States. “The eyes and ears of the world are upon you,” he said, addressing his American brethren at an assembly of the Gold Coast legislature. “Yea, our oppressed brothers throughout this vast continent of Africa and the New World are looking to you with desperate hope.”
During the independence era, many prominent African Americans — W.E.B. Du Bois, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou — visited the young Ghana, seeing in it the hope for a bold new vision of African — and black — identity. Five decades later, visiting the country in 2009, President Obama gave his steadfast support to a nation that, through years of steady economic growth and democratic governance, has been celebrated as a beacon of hope and progress on the continent.
Foreign arrivals have spiked in the two years since the president's visit; local commentators have dubbed this the “Obama effect.” For the tourism industry, though, the challenge is striking the right balance between the sobering lessons of history and the free-spirited hedonism that reigns on the country's coasts. After my tour of the castle, the heavy cotton-wool sky was almost like a physical weight on my shoulders. And yet just a few hours later, there I was, decompressing at the bar of the Oasis Beach Resort. It was an odd, disquieting feeling. A sign above the reception desk assured weekend revelers: “Bar operates till the last one drops out.” A drum troupe had begun beating out its Friday night show; sallow Peace Corps kids kicked their bare feet in the sand. If the weight of memory became too much to bear, the cheerful oblivion of a weekend beach party in Cape Coast was apparently just a few Star beers away.
Up and down the coast, between day trips to forts in varying degrees of restoration and disrepair, I was reminded of what Angelou once wrote about this country: “While the rest of the world has been improving technology, Ghana has been improving the quality of man's humanity to man.”
In the past two decades, since making the transition from military to democratic rule, Ghana has been spared the instability of many of its West African neighbors. Perhaps it is Ghanaians' easy humor and grace, the day-to-day gratitude for life's small blessings, that have helped propel this country forward and allowed it to cast such a spell over visitors. As one airport worker assured me, wheeling my baggage through the arrivals hall, “Even other Africans that come here, they say Ghana is the best.”
It was a variation on the welcome I received wherever I traveled. A few days after leaving Cape Coast, I found myself in Ampenyi, a small fishing village at the end of a dirt track off the main coast road. Walking along the beach one morning, I met a high school student, a player on the village's Freedom Stars soccer team, who guided me by the hand through dirt streets of tumbledown houses toward his home. A congenial old man wobbled out from the living room to greet us. It was the boy's father, a fisherman, an old-style paterfamilias in pressed slacks and hair long gone white from the cares of raising a family. He touched his chest lightly and took my hand between his own. “I hope you can continue coming here,” he said, with a proud tilt to his chin, as if the future wealth of nations depended on such small coins of generosity and goodwill.
On my last days in the country, I arrived in Elmina, some 10 miles west of Cape Coast, for the start of the annual Edina Bakatue harvest festival. The day marked the end of a six-week moratorium on fishing in the town's small lagoon; according to tradition, the local elders had introduced the ban as a way to allow the fish to replenish. On the waterfront, crowds gathered in the shade of billowing white pavilions; a procession of low-ranking parliamentarians and corporate spokesmen took the dais, offering platitudes. It had seemed, for much of the morning, like any one of the countless festivals I'd attended across the continent: the wildly popular Akon's songs breaking the speakers; unattended children running rampant through the crowd; corporate logos everywhere.
Suddenly the crowd began to agitate; the beating of drums and the ringing of cowbells roiled like a gathering storm. A procession of village chiefs then snaked its way through the crowd, wearing colorful robes and toga-style dresses, their necks hung with gold chains and pendants, their fingers ringed, their heads crowned with gold headdresses. It was like stepping into mythology, the chiefs and sub-chiefs and standard-bearers dressed for a coronation, the sun spangling the lagoon. Joyous voices pealed like church bells. A man beside me lifted his proud head to tell me the name of his village, buried somewhere in the hinterlands of Central Region. When I asked whether he'd seen his chief arrive for the festivities, he paused and said with great significance, “There was eye contact.”
The festival reached its climax. The paramount chief of Elmina rose, lifted the hem of his robe and slowly, solemnly waded into the lagoon. He sank a net into the murky water and hauled it into the air. (“Full of rubbish and a few fish,” laughed the man beside me.) The crowd surged forward, men and women with their camera phones poised, hoping to get a good snapshot of the chief.
It was a poignant reminder, I thought, of how history works both ways. Slavery had severed so many of the ties that had held together families and clans; but perhaps the bonds of those who remained in Ghana had become more durable, able — like the ramparts of the castles lining the coasts — to endure the steady attrition of time.
Vourlias, a freelance writer living in Johannesburg, is working on his first novel.
Taking a break from his regular duties driving Tony Stark to his various Marvel movie cameos, Jon Favreau has announced that he's working on a new VR experience about gnomes. The Jungle Book director is credited as a “creator” on Gnomes & Goblins, a new HTC Vive program from Reality One and Wevr, the studio that produced the “swimming with whales” VR experience theBlu.

Wevr is releasing a preview for Gnomes & Goblins next week via Steam, allowing inclined HTC Vive owners to take a step into Favreau's imagination and meet all the tiny, pointy-eared creatures that live there. According to the director, he's been toying with this world—which looks to be mostly made up of elaborately constructed tree forts—for years, searching for the right medium to bring it to life. Now, he says, he's found “something that feels not so much like a game and not so much cinematic, but where you have the opportunity to explore the same feelings you get while lucid dreaming.”
Favreau's lucid dream will be available to consumers (in preview form) on September 8.
This is a story of loss.
This is a story of internet camaraderie.
This is a story of triumphing over adversity and weather and forgetting to put your hat on backwards in gale force winds.
This is a story so inspiring that Disney has already optioned the rights so they can turn it into a box office smash that would rival Treasure Planet. Don't believe me? There's already a trailer!
I know, you can't wait to spend $17 to watch it in 3D can you? Before you do, I want to tell you the full story. Because the true joy of this tale is HOW my hat came home. Not via a magic wormhole like Disney is gonna say. But through simple kindness, good timing, and Twitter.
Behind the scenes of HWB-TIHJ
Saturday's game against Purdue was a tough one for me. Not because Minnesota lost, but because I lost my favorite Gophers hat (I have priorities people). I can hear you judging me already: “HOW DO YOU LOSE A HAT? YOU PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD AND YOU KEEP IT THERE UNTIL YOU TAKE IT OFF IN A PLACE THAT IS SAFE.” And you'd be right dear reader. Here is the inspiring story of how I lost my hat due to poor planning but had it returned to me through the magic of the internet.
It all started with a typical Indiana thunderstorm. The kind that shows up out of nowhere and rolls through with speed and ferocity.
For those who weren't watching this all time legendary matchup, the storm showed up at the end of the third quarter/beginning of the 4th quarter. And being a photography obsessed individual, I wanted to get a cool shot of the sunset combined with the incoming storm plus Ross-Ade under the lights. There was no time to waste, so to the top of the North Endzone stands I went, in search of perfection. The result was exactly what I hoped for:
Then, tragedy struck.
A gust of win stole my favorite Gophers hat and sent it flying over the back of the stadium! I was beside myself. At first it looked like it might land in the concourse, but instead it landed on top of the concession stands behind the North Endzone. All hope was lost. Immediately after this crushing blow, Purdue also kicked a field goal to take the lead. I could not be bothered to think about this minor detail given the loss of my friend. Then the rains came down, the game was interrupted, and we all ran to Mackey Arena to find shelter from the storm.
In that moment of darkness there was only one thing I could do. I took to Twitter to share my despair.
Also the wind stole my fave gold #Gophers hat after I shot this.
I now hate Purdue forever. https://t.co/Z3q2npEdL0 — Elite Zubaz (@GoAUpher) October 7, 2017
This tweet was retweeted by Hammer & Rails and I received a number of quality replies from Purdue fans:
Payback for Hummel — Patrick Mura (@patrickmura38) October 7, 2017
This is the sort of long held grievance I have to tip my cap to. https://t.co/QdPp5ZYVfU — Elite Zubaz (@GoAUpher) October 7, 2017
The weather gods have provided you this replacement that blew into my arms on the way to shelter. Meet me in Mackey and join the dark side. pic.twitter.com/bKRvkrqk2E — Anthony Rufatto (@1F2Ts) October 7, 2017
The levity helped, but I was still down about having to contemplate getting a new hat. (SIDE NOTE: Part of this is because there are not NEARLY enough quality gold Minnesota hats out there). And then came a moment of college football kindness that would change my week.
pics? I'll look for it — Ross McBride (@rossmcbride13) October 7, 2017
Ross is a Purdue sophomore and a cool dude. We met up outside Mackey to talk while we waited for the rain to stop and he let me know that he works on the Ross-Ade cleanup crew and would be happy to try and locate my lost lid.
I appreciated the gesture a great deal, though I expected little to come of it. Not because I thought Ross wouldn't look (I knew he would) but because how often does something like this really work out? Plus, I figured no one would give him the ladder he needed for insurance reasons (risk management folks gonna risk management).
On Sunday he let me know that he wasn't able to get access to a ladder, but that he emailed the stadium ops people about it and would update me if he heard anything. Once again, his efforts made my day and once again, I assumed that my hat was gone because what stadium ops person is going to worry about a Minnesota hat on top of a concession stand?
I went on with my week. I recounted the story with a smile to my friends in Cincy. But at no point did I really think I'd see my hat again.
/inspiring Disney score begins to play
I underestimated the power of nice people going out of there way to help out a random fan. Because yesterday I received the following DM on Twitter:
MY HAT WAS BACK! Soaking wet, a little dirty, but BACK! There is no little kid hugging a golden retriever movie moment that could ever make me feel as happy as the surprise of my hat actually getting found.
The Disney message at the heart of it all
This is why I don't ever want to let myself get too worked up over a football game. I had fun despite the frustrating loss on Saturday because of good people. I met good people at the tailgate lot, I met good people at the game, and I met GREAT people on Twitter and at Mackey Arena when I thought my hat was gone forever.
Having fun and being a good person, that's what life is about friends!
TL;DR
NICE PEOPLE ROCK AND SWEET GOLD MINNESOTA HATS ARE HARDER TO FIND THAN THEY SHOULD BE.
Fear was removed after an update.
The contents of this page no longer exist in RuneScape, and this article is kept for historical purposes.
Fear was an evil magic spell available before the evil and good magic skills were merged into one spellbook. It required three body runes and one mind rune.
Contents show]
Effect
Fear was cast on an attackable NPC to allow a player to avoid combat with that NPC. Fear had two entirely different effects, depending on the state of the target NPC:
NPC in combat
When Fear was cast on an NPC engaged in combat with the casting player, the NPC would retreat from combat, and stop being aggressive toward the casting player. This was often used as a move of desperation for players overwhelmed by the target NPC.
NPC not in combat
When Fear was cast on NPCs not engaged in combat, the spell would make the NPC "disappear." Essentially, the NPC would appear to log off, just as a player would. No bones would be left behind, and minutes later, the NPC would respawn as normal. While it is unknown whether this effect was a bug or not, many players used the spell as a joke on other players who were trying to train combat, casting fear on others' training targets. Other players used it to steal kills, much to the annoyance of others.

It's time to step my game up. I mean that seriously. I look at my CV or when I have a very honest and conversation with my old lab mate: we always come to the sobering conclusion
The writing is on the wall.
I have a demon. Writing has always been my nemesis. I know, this might sound like the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard. I'm a science blogger for goodness sake. But I have overwhelming insecurity about my writing; (sometimes it's even paralyzing). Interestingly, blogging helped me defeat that demon once before. Blogging actually helped me improve my writing. One of committee members remarked at how polished drafts of my chapters were, better than he had ever read from a student before. I was flattered. Practice does make perfect -- that and some great lab mates who read and critiqued my drafts many times before sharing them with the committee. The truth is, I really miss my old university. It was a very supportive and encouraging environment. It wasn't perfect (I didn't publish my works), but I didn't feel like the mess I am right now. My old nemesis has set up shop in my mind again - Science Writing. I mean writing up my science research. Writing up experiments to submit to journals.
I'm a postdoc, dammit. I'm at the precipice of my career. I'm at no-turning-back-now point in my career. Writing about science and research and science communication is great, but when they say publish or perish, they don't mean online publishing. They mean the meat and potatoes of science and academia.
The first step is admit you have a problem and ask for help. I reached out and I was led to Paul Silvia's How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing. The foundation of his advice is to write routinely. Schedule a time. Guard it jealously; and write. Write your thesis. Write articles. Write book chapters. Write grants. And do all those things that are needed to write, such as read necessary papers, revise drafts, confirm references. You're even allowed to write creatively on other projects. The goal is written, whether you feel like it or not. Whether you feel inspired or not. Write. Measure what you've done - word count, page count, chapters completed, revisions submitted, whatever. Metrics matter.
I'm still at the setting a viable schedule phase, but I realize the last time I needed to stay accountable for writing I stated my goals and daily progress online for the whole world to see. It worked before, so here I am again. I'm putting myself out there for all you to judge and/or encourage me. But the courage to do all of this came when I met Dr. Joan Slonczewski, scientist and science fiction writer, yesterday. She was the department seminar speaker yesterday. In addition to her talk - "Bridging Biology and the Arts and Humanities: Acid-stressed bacteria in science fiction", I had a chance to speak with her several times was truly inspired to tackle this demon once ad for all. I took her presence and her words to me during our conversations as Divine Providence.
First, on Academic Writing:
After your defense, don't delay the write-up. It only gets harder.
She wasn't necessarily talking to me, but she was. I was in a room with graduate students discussing the pros and cons of teaching/researching at a smaller college. Her words were like jab in the side. I know I am overdue for writing up and submitting my dissertation chapters for journal publication. But for some completely flaky and/or specious reason, I just haven't done it. And what it completely sad (and simultaneously infuriating) is that it is done. No extra stats to do. My committee was so damn fantastic that they advised and critiqued my papers the way journal editors would do.
So, objective #1 - Schedule a writing time. Monday - Friday mornings (for starters) writing from 9:00 am - noon. No checking email. No twitter, no phone calls. No meetings. Silvia says to carve out at least 4 hours a week writing. I need to narrow down and figure when is my best time to write and effectively eliminate distractions. This should be a good 'pilot study'.
Goal #1 - Write up and submit my dissertation chapters. I'll need to set up a major board or system for writing down my ultimate and intermediate goals and deadlines. I also need to come up with a metric system for keeping track of my progress (and sharing with you all); but this (writing it out for the blog) is how I'm getting started. I probably need to set up something akin to an editorial calendar where I can write up my writing assignments - both academic and for blog in one place, very conspicuous to me.
However, I realize I also need some carrots, too. Dr. Slonczewski also shared her entree into science fiction writing. Science inspires her imagination, and as a result she begins to see things, the world through new hypothetical lens.
All of her scifi narrative are imaginary takes on real biological phenomena of the microbes she studies. She also shared that she wrote her very first scifi book before starting graduate school. It was a lark, but she realized she loved it and continued writing throughout grad school. In fact, the writing proved beneficial. She was able to write up her thesis quickly because she was already in the practice of writing routinely. (A nod to the advice offered by Silvia and affirmation that discipline matters.) I've been saying that this postdoc experience has been a hoot. I swear, weekly lab meetings alone give me enough fodder to write plausible fiction, that I could become the next Michael Crichton. I even shared on Twitter that I think I'd like to write short stories inspired by my science experiences. So I'm going to indulge my creative writing side, too. Plus, this offers me some positive rewards.
So, I'm introducing Short-story Saturdays. Each Saturday I'll post a story that I've been ruminating on. I don't promise that it will be great or even complete; but I will post it. It's that accountability thing. I'm also hoping for some feedback so I can refine my skill, voice, etc. Deep down inside I'm hoping I can catch the attention of a publisher/benefactor who might be willing to pay me a little moolah so I can generate some revenue to get the Department of Ed off of my back.
It'll be interesting and productive ride, no matter the outcome. Thanks for joining me.

Sen. Bernie Sanders supporters were recently caught on camera beating each other up, mistaking each as Donald Trump supporters.
In the video, which was uploaded to YouTube Friday, rowdy protesters are seen getting more violent with each other, thinking the others were Trump supporters. Towards the end of the one-minute video, the crowd begins to chant “Bernie! Bernie!”
WATCH:
The fight broke out during the protest of the Trump rally at San Jose Thursday. The protesters attacked Trump supporters in other instances, pelting them with eggs, burning “Make America Great Again” hats and American flags.
San Jose police widely condemned the violence perpetrated by the protesters at a press conference Friday.
“I'm disgusted by the violent attacks yesterday that have no place in our society or our political process,” Paul Kelly, president of the San Jose Police Officers' Assn. said. The chief of police admitted there were not enough officers to cover the event, stating there were over 450 protesters in attendance and only 200 officers trying to keep the peace.
“At some point, Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign,” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, a clinton supporter, said. He later stated that he blamed Trump for holding rallies that people protest.

Hello Crowfans how are you doing? I'm doing swell thanks for asking. Recently we got to see the Templar in action. I've talked about prior so I don't have a lot to say beyond it was nice to see how directly ACE translates their plans to gameplay. Some games differ quite a bit from concept to write up to implementation but ACE has been one of the most consistent I've seen. That goes all the way back to their Kickstarter. Things will naturally change throughout testing but it's nice to feel confident that what they are telling me in updates will not be far off from what they implement.

I took a minute and hit the interweb to scour a video of the new intro and character selection. Several things are roughed in right now but it already looks like a smooth system. I was relieved to see the character customization UI pop up upon selecting a archetype. The harvesting looks fantastic. It's like smashing a piñata with a harvesting tool that reminds me of a light saber. (You know your old when the harvesting cools are exciting.)
In the biggest news of this column ACE revisited their Knight. (lol this column doesn't make ANY news) I've only briefly played the Knight but ever since the first promo it's been the character I'm most interested in. Traditionally I click with one character more than the rest. So far, the Knight is my Huckleberry. I don't know if It's because he looks like Superman or because he is shiny, probably both. Being contrarian I don't want to like him because he is so typically cool but I can't help it. Sometimes the cool thing is cool for a reason, it's that cool.
“Now, the players will be able to test our newest experiment: a single resource pool for an archetype. All the Knight's powers and skills have been updated to consume and generate stamina. We even added some new skills to reduce the amount of food it needs to consume due to its extreme use of stamina.”
One of the pleasures of backing a crowd funded game has been watching how much things change over time. (More like one of the pains of backing a crowd funded game is time.) For now, the knight runs on stamina, that might change again. It's all part of the process but that begs the question, what are we doing? Like…what is this maaannn? We read the news and speculate about what it means to the game but in the end, isn't all speculation just…pointless? Are we just passing time because that's all we can do? What if we all just said nothing until the day it launched? What is life?
Melodramatic kidding aside it's fun to speculate and it does keep the development moving a bit for those of us that ghost its progress. I'd much rather be playing a game but if I had a game to play I wouldn't be chasing crowd funders like a dog after a car. That reminds me, what if these games launch and I don't know what to do with them? What if I don't have the time to play them?!?! #firstworldproblems (Enough with the vague questions!)
“Sometimes, we can make a series of positive tweaks to an archetype in a few days! We added some fun new toys to the Knight and changed the way C powers work for everyone. I am sure we will need to tweak some values after you guys play the Knight, but this was a much-needed pass over the class's powers and (hopefully) a big step in the right direction for its playability.”
I'm glad the Knight's damage got a bump. In my brief time playing the class it felt a little under powered. Its testing so I don't worry about balance but just for playing purposes it will make him more enjoyable.
Having recently dabbled with some MOBA PVP for the first time I find myself wondering if Crowfall will end up taking the tank path that many of them seem to, that of the damage tank. Pulling aggro on human players is tricky in FPS combat. It seems like rather than work in defensive mechanics that convince people to focus the tank many games just make the tank output enough damage or annoyance to make them a problem worth focusing on.
I wonder if ACE plans any damage channeling or absorption the likes of which I last saw in WAR Online? The type where a tank had a constant friendly target and could use defensive abilities to absorb their damage. It was a cool concept at the time and I'd like to see it tied again. I guess I like my old school tanky tanks more than the MOBA kind but to each their own. I don't know what Crowfall is planning but it will be interesting to see what kind of tanking their tanks use once combat begins to set in for a launch.

Fusion TV just released an in-depth investigative documentary exposing the underbelly of the chicken industry – from the abuse and neglect forced upon animals to the unfair conditions endured by contractors to marketing claims that are misleading consumers.
The documentary is based on Craig Watts, a North Carolina contract farmer who has raised chickens for Perdue since the early 1990's, even earning recognition as a top producer. But after 20-plus years working for this company, he became so fed up with the problems he has witnessed and experienced first-hand that late last year, he broke his silence — exposing to the world the cruel and very dark secrets of the chicken industry.
With the support of Compassion in World Farming, he's allowed camera crews inside his sheds to document the miseries forced upon animals. He has spoken with media about the unfair conditions for contract farmers who are kept in near-poverty. And he's talked about the marketing on Perdue products which he says imply a level of care that “couldn't get any further from the truth.”
Craig is a whistleblower in its truest form – and he's not ready to put down that whistle anytime soon.
In fact, since Watts has spoken out, he claims he has suffered from retaliation from Perdue – with the legal representation of the Government Accountability Project, he filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor.
To capture all of this on film, Fusion explains: “We followed Craig as he wrestled with becoming a whistleblower, showed us the conditions on farms, got nationwide attention for stepping forward—and then saw how the chicken industry reacted. Here is his story.”
Fusion's full 8-part documentary, “Cock Fight: Meet the farmer blowing the whistle on Big Chicken” is available online. You can start viewing the first chapter below.
This incredibly powerful and shocking story not only sheds light on the hidden cruelties of animal agribusiness, it also offers a reminder that the most effective step we can take to protect animals is to simply leave them off our plates. Start today: TryVeg.com
President Donald Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort was indicted on 12 counts related to hiding foreign payments, including one count of "conspiracy against the United States."
Manafort's former longtime business partner, Rick Gates, also was charged in the 31 page indictment, made public on Monday. Gates and Manafort both surrendered to authorities on Monday morning.
The two men pleaded not guilty to all charges during a court appearance later Monday. A spokesman for Gates said the former lobbyist "welcomes the opportunity to confront these charges in court." A Manafort spokesman declined to comment.
In a statement, Special Counsel's Office spokesman Peter Carr said the indictment "contains 12 counts: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign [government], false and misleading [foreign lobbying disclosures], false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. The case was unsealed today after the defendants were permitted to surrender themselves to the custody of the FBI."
Multiple law enforcement sources also told NBC News there was a statute of limitations issue in play that may have helped drive the timing of the indictments, which were handed down Friday.
Following news of the indictments, a White House source told NBC News that the charges had not come as a surprise to the Trump administration. "The White House has been saying for weeks the special counsel is moving far more quickly and deliberatively than people have been reporting. The fact that the special counsel is actively performing its duties does not come as a surprise to the White House," the source said.
The indictments mark a new phase in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. They also cap off a year of escalating legal problems for Manafort and Gates, who worked with Manafort for years on many of his foreign lobbying contracts.
Obama's “just-in-time” workforce:
17 million temporary workers in America
By Nancy Hanover
15 July 2013
An early morning scene at a temporary agency [Photo: Sally Ryan for ProPublica]
A year ago, incumbent candidate Barack Obama referred to “the defining issue of our time” as “good, middle-class jobs, so people can have confidence if they work hard, they can get ahead.” Obama was hailed, in typical fashion, by the pseudo-lefts of the Nation as “arguing eloquently for public initiatives to save the middle class and revive the American dream.”
This promise of good, middle-class jobs was among Obama's most cruel and cynical pledges.
In fact, the crisis unleashed in 2008 was deliberately prosecuted by the Obama government for the purposes of transforming America's work environment.This assault on workers' standards of living was spearheaded by the administration's demand to cut autoworkers' wages in half as a precondition for the auto bailout. It has been continually worsened through the wholesale attack on federal jobs, state funding, workers' protections and most recently the sequestration.
Millions of workers are now paying the price. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco demonstrates graphically the extent to which better-paying jobs have been switched out en masse for low-wage positions, drastically increasing the working poor over the past four years.
Sixty percent of the jobs destroyed in the aftermath of the crash were “mid-range occupations, paying between $13.83 and $21.13 per hour. However, 58 percent of the jobs that have returned pay less than $13.83. The bulk of the jobs created since the recession, 1.7 million, have been in food services, retail and temporary agencies, sectors in which workers typically remain below the poverty level even working full-time.
Temporary agencies have emerged as the growth industry of the Obama administration. No other sector of the economy comes close. These jobs, the nation's most insecure and low-paying, have jumped 50 percent since the end of the recession. A full 12 percent of the American workforce, a staggering 17 million people, is now forced to depend on the uncertain and stressful world of contingency work.
ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, recently published “TempLand: Working in the New Economy”. The series of articles portrays the proliferation of the blue-collar “permatemp” in the 1990s. This phenomenon dominates in many smaller US towns where workers, even with technical training, cannot find manufacturing or warehouse work without first being directed to a temp agency. For many thousands, they spend years—even decades—as temps, even under the deceitful category of “temp to permanent.”

Author Michael Grabell documents the temp “ecosystem” in Chicago's Little Village, the largest Mexican community in the Midwest. It is a pattern replicated in poorer neighborhoods across the US.
In Little Village, a loose network of local labor contractors, raiteros, hire groups of workers, often online, and then pick them up from hiring halls, street corners or alleys and pack them into vans and buses for commutes to warehouse jobs. The raiteros have melded with temp agencies and their corporate clients: they recruit, deciding who works and who does not, and distribute paychecks, explains Grabell. “And it's the low-wage workers — not the temp agencies or their clients, corporate giants like Ty [of Beanie Baby fame] — who bear the cost. Officially, the raiteros ' fee, usually $8 a day, is for transportation. But, workers say, anyone who doesn't pay doesn't get work.
“From this crowded barrio,” the report continues, “ raiteros ferry as many as 1,000 workers a day to warehouses and factories in Chicago and its suburbs. Many of these workers end up making about $6 an hour, well below Illinois' minimum wage of $8.25 an hour, because of the fees and unpaid waiting time.
“If you complain too much, they won't take you to work anymore,” Maria Castro told ProPublica. “Like other workers, Castro said she has never been to Select Remedy, the temp agency that officially employs her. She knows Ty only as los peluches, Spanish for ‘the stuffed animals.'
“Ty is among a long list of brand-name companies that benefit from the raitero system,” the author notes. “Workers report packing products for Sony, Frito Lay, Pampered Chef, Smirnoff, Marlboro and Fresh Express, a subsidiary of Chiquita Brands where workers cut vegetables for bagged salads and fast-food restaurants like Burger King and McDonald's.”
These temp workers are contracted day to day. Grabell described the schedule that these workers endure. Typically, a worker will need to arise by 3 a.m. in order to get to the labor contracting site by 4:30 a.m. At that time, the prospective workers will get on a list and then wait to see if they are called. If so, they can be transported to the work site, to arrive by 6 a.m. Then the paid workday begins.
Select Family of Staffing Companies, Castro's employer, posted $1.8 billion in revenue last year and employs nearly 100,000 people every week, according to ProPublica's profile of the firm. Started in 1985, Select bought more than three dozen staffing firms in the 2000s and became a national chain. Its revenues skyrocketed from just over $300 million in 2002 to $1.8 billion in 2011. In 2012, Staffing Industry Analysts, a research firm, ranked Select the 10th largest temp agency in America and the fourth largest in the industrial sector. It supplies workers to Walmart warehouses, Bank of America, Toyota, Costco, Trader Joe's, General Mills, Mattel and Fisher-Price, ProPublica reports.
Temp agencies have become among the largest employers in America. Kelly Services is second in size only to Walmart. Adecco is a global Fortune 500 company placing 650,000 workers daily in 60 countries.
High concentrations of temp workers dominate cities throughout the US, including Grand Rapids, Michigan; Middlesex County, New Jersey; Memphis, Tennessee; Inland Empire, California; and Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Tens of thousands of temps are used by America's largest corporations—Walmart, Macy's, Frito-Lay, Nike, Walgreens, Del Monte. ProPublica pointed out that the list of major companies not using contingent labor would probably be shorter than those who take advantage of such “flexible” labor.
The use of temp labor has proliferated throughout the auto industry, without any significant opposition from the UAW. The practice is rarely publicized. General Motors hires contract workers at its Lake Orion plant, through Logistics Insight, for $9 an hour. In Greenville County, South Carolina, hundreds of temps are supplied to luxury automaker BMW by MAU Workforce Solutions. Willie Pearson told ProPublica that he has not seen a worker hired directly by BMW since 2005. No one “has been hired straight on. It's all been through temporary agencies,” he said. At VW's plant in Chattanooga, TN, temp company Aerotek pays autoworkers $12 per hour, the same rate of pay as Nissan's contract workers in Canton, Mississippi.
For temps, the pay is always lower and the injury rates higher. It is estimated that at least one million temp workers earn less than $25,000 a year.
Only 8 percent of temp workers in the US receive health care, compared with 56 percent of employees nationally. The states decide if additional fees can be deducted from wages, as are Castro's. Recently temp firms have successfully lobbied to change laws or regulatory interpretations in 31 states, so that workers cannot get unemployment benefits without reregistering with the temp agency.
The system is a boon to businesses. Not only are wages rock-bottom, but the system allows the host company to order workers based on how production fluctuates, while also reducing a series of business costs—from workman's compensation claims to unemployment taxes to regulatory compliance. Often temporaries are denied overtime pay. Moreover, with a series of corporate layers often involved, the arrangement provides corporate immunity from lawsuits over unsafe or abusive work environments.
ProPublica uncovered the fact that in some large factories and warehouses, the client company will use 3, 4, 5 or more different temp staffing agencies, as well as direct-hires. Companies such as Walmart have been known to switch temp agencies every six months, to limit possible liability.
It is assumed in the industry that Obamacare will result in another upswing, as businesses sidestep the provision to provide medical coverage for permanent workers. Last week, however, the Obama administration itself delayed the implementation of the provision for a year.
In January, a study “At the Company's Mercy” was released by the Center for Progressive Reform documenting the disproportionate rates of injuries and death sustained by temporary workers. Hundreds of thousands of temp workers perform the most hazardous labor in the US—largely without health care and often without recourse to workman's compensation.
The report begins citing the 2005 BP explosion at its Texas City refinery, which killed 15 workers and injured another 180. All 15 workers who were killed were contractors, as were 166 of the 180 workers who were seriously injured (92 percent). The seriously injured workers came from 13 different firms.
The study examined the rise of temporary workers in four areas, including farming, construction, warehousing and the hotel industry. “Growers are increasingly turning to farm labor contractors as a source of workers,” explained CPR, “with the percentage of workers hired through those firms increasing from 14 percent in 1993-1994 to 21 percent in 2001-2002. CPR notes, “These workers face stagnating wages that remain below federal poverty levels, unhealthy work and living conditions that do not meet basic standards, and even cases of modern day slavery.”
Temporaries in the construction industry usually perform the most dangerous jobs, such as general laborers, painters and roofers, jobs that carry significant risks of musculoskeletal injuries, falls and nail-gun injuries.
Warehousing hires hundreds of thousands of contingent workers. This industry is known for its repetitive stresses of lifting and moving goods, often resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome and nerve system damage. Warehousing and storage workers die on the job at a rate almost twice that of the average US worker.
While these types of blue-collar work are the largest segment of temp workers, many traditionally white-collar jobs are now outsourced to agencies as well. Among temp workers, 15 percent are data entry keyers, 11.5 percent are demonstrators and product promoters. There are thousands of accountants, office workers, technical employees and even doctors. Staffing Industry Analysts, an industry consortium, forecasts that spending on temporary doctors will grow 10 percent this year and next.
The explosion of the temp industry is one part of the assault on the living standards of the working class. The very notion of the right to a job—and what constitutes a job—has undergone a sea change.
A recent case of a canned-goods drive in Kalamazoo, Michigan became a notorious sign of the times—as it affected what previously was an elite section of the workforce. The food items were being collected for the part-time adjunct faculty at the local community college, many of whom qualified for food stamps.
Likewise, young people seeking to enter the job market have been forced, in the millions, to take low-paying or non-paying “internships” in another version of the destruction of jobs. According to a 2008 study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 50 percent of graduating seniors had an internship, with about half those estimated to be unpaid.
The Obama administration's policy, far from reversing the destruction of workers' rights prosecuted with such vengeance in the 1980s and 1990s, has accelerated the impoverishment of wide swaths of America. Needless to add, as corrupt supports of the capitalist profit system, the AFL-CIO and other unions have thrown their support to the process.
An FIR was registered against Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui on Sunday for allegedly assaulting a woman over a parking dispute. The actor's manager, however, denied the incident and said the police registered the complaint without verification. The rep said there was an argument but no “haathapai” took place.
The case was filed at the Versova police station in Mumbai though the actor had not been arrested till late on Sunday evening.
Arun Chavan, assistant commissioner of police, said, “We registered a case against Nawazuddin under IPC section 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty) based on the complainant's version. As of now we have not arrested any person, and are in the process of verifying the facts.”
According to the complainant, who is the granddaughter of the chairman of the society where both she and Siddiqui live, she was sitting in the society office at around 1.30 pm when a person came and tried to park his motorcycle in the society compound. Nawazuddin's bodyguards who were standing at the spot asked the person not to park his motorcycle there. The complainant said that when she heard the commotion, she came out of the office and started clicking photographs on her mobile phone. The motorcyclist left the society and at the same time Nawazuddin came down and asked the complainant not to click photographs which led to an altercation. The complainant alleged that when she refused, Nawazuddin pushed her following which she called the police.
In her complaint, the woman also pointed out that Nawazuddin had refused to accept a notice sent earlier by the society's chairman and secretary to members over complaints related to parking space. The notice was sent to Nawazuddin over him using additional parking space.

Despite repeated attempts, the actor could not be reached for a comment, but his manager, Anup Pandey, denied the charge. “It is a false case. The case has been registered without investigation. It is a society issue which has been going on for a long time,” Pandey told PTI. “There was an argument, but no hathaa-pai (exchange of physical blows) as claimed in the complaint. We will take the matters up.”
The 41-year-old actor is currently gearing up for the release of his upcoming film Raees. His last release was Manjhi -The Mountain Man.

(Reuters) - An HIV outbreak in southeastern Indiana related to abuse of intravenous prescription drugs has jumped by 24 cases in the past week, an increase attributed to offering more testing resources, state health officials said on Friday.
The outbreak centered in rural Scott County near the border with Kentucky has reached 130 cases, including 10 preliminary positive tests, up from 106 a week ago, health officials said.
Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, has been the center of the outbreak, the biggest in the state's history.
A needle exchange program started April 4 for Scott County residents has so far distributed 5,322 clean syringes to 86 people and collected 1,400 used syringes, health officials said.
Although Indiana bans needle exchanges, Governor Mike Pence has authorized a short-term program to address the outbreak by providing drug users with sterile needles.
The temporary exchange program, which aims to prevent infections from spreading through the sharing of contaminated needles, is set to expire on April 25 but could be extended if needed.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. More than 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Littleton, Colo. --
Convicted former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich walked into a federal prison in Colorado to begin a 14-year sentence for corruption on Thursday, the latest chapter in the downfall of a charismatic politician that seemed more like a bizarre reality TV show than a legal battle.
With helicopters and TV news crews broadcasting his every move, Blagojevich stepped out of a black SUV and walked into the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood in suburban Denver just before noon. Blagojevich - Illinois' second ex-governor now in prison for corruption - was convicted on 18 counts, including charges of trying to sell or trade President Barack Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat.
"I'm leaving with a heavy heart, a clear conscience and I have high, high hopes for the future," Blagojevich told reporters and well-wishers as he left his Chicago home early Thursday for his flight to Denver.
In what had become a familiar scene in the three years since his arrest, an optimistic if not defiant Blagojevich bounded down the stairs of his Chicago home through a throng of photographers and cameramen Thursday morning. Supporters were shouting encouragement.
The night before, the famously talkative Democrat - who was caught on FBI wiretaps saying the opportunity to trade an appointment to Obama's old Senate seat for campaign cash or a top job was "f- golden" - embraced the public spotlight one last time.
"While my faith in things has sometimes been challenged, I still believe this is America, this is a country that is governed by the rule of law, that the truth ultimately will prevail," Blagojevich told crowds of media and supporters, his wife standing by his side.
When he finally arrived at the prison Thursday, the spotlight went away - and he became Inmate No. 40892-424.
Under federal rules, inmates must serve at least 85 percent of their terms before becoming eligible for early release. That's nearly 12 years for Blagojevich, though his term could be reduced under a prison program.
A law graduate, he also could research his case in the prison library. He and his attorneys are appealing both the 14-year sentence and his convictions.
The 15th annual Run for Zimbabwe Orphans and Fair is scheduled noon to 4 p.m. Sunday at St. Joseph Catholic School in Mountain View.
“I'm very excited about this year's race,” said Los Altos resident Ellen Clark, the event's chief organizer and founder of the nonprofit Sustainable Living Foundation.
Megha Agarwal, a senior at St. Francis High School and race ambassador the past two years, said this year's fifth- and sixth-grade mile race is dedicated to the memory of the Rev. Eric Freed, a former St. Francis chaplain and religious studies teacher who died Jan. 1.
“He was a supporter of the Zimbabwe Run and a great friend of the Clarks,” said Clark of Freed. “He, in fact, was the presider at the wedding of my son and daughter-in-law, Will and Kristin Clark.”
This year's proceeds will benefit the 92 orphans of the Makumbi Children's Home in Zimbabwe and construction of the Sister Batsirai Cottage.
“The cottage will make a big difference in the lives of at least eight young women, ages 17 and 18, who have aged out of the orphanage,” Clark said.
According to Clark, Zimbabwe faces many challenges, including a 90 percent unemployment rate and a high poverty rate that renders young women susceptible to prostitution, sex trafficking and forced marriage.
“The Sustainable Living Foundation, in partnership with Makumbi, is trying to make a difference in this one area by empowering young women with job skills and vocational education,” she said.
In addition to races, the event includes T-shirt sales, a Zimbabwe Run Slam Poetry performance to the beat of drums, cultural booths and art exhibits.
The race entry fee is $5, free for those who cannot pay the fee.

How Do Americans Feel About The NFL Protests? It Depends On How You Ask.
The debate over NFL player protests was reignited on Sunday when Vice President Mike Pence left an Indianapolis Colts game early after a number of players on the visiting San Francisco 49ers kneeled during the national anthem. (At least one player on the team has kneeled during the anthem every week this season.) President Trump said Pence left at his request.
Polls about the protests have shown wildly different, seemingly conflicting results about where the public stands. But the polling results aren't as conflicting as they seem, and what pollsters find is heavily influenced by what the debating parties believe the protests mean.
Those poll questions basically focus on one of three frameworks:
Patriotism. Trump said his objections to the protests were about “respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem,” not about race. Free speech. Some onlookers have defended the protests as a matter of free speech, regardless of what issues that speech is meant to highlight. Race. When Colin Kaepernick first began protesting during the national anthem a little over a year ago, he said he wasn't going to show pride in a country that oppresses people of color, citing a litany of police violence against black Americans.
These three ways of looking at the protests have colored the polling. A recent CBS/YouGov poll of over 1,300 respondents asked people — regardless of whether they agreed with the protests — what NFL players were trying to do by kneeling during the national anthem. A large majority (73 percent) of respondents said the players were trying to call attention to racism, and 69 percent said players were calling attention to police violence. But 40 percent said the protests were trying to disrespect the flag, while 33 percent said the goal was to disrespect the military.
As might be expected, answers to that question, and to nearly all poll questions related to the NFL protests, are highly polarized by race and party. There are stark differences, for example, between what black and white Americans say is the protests' purpose. Among white respondents, 50 percent said players were trying to disrespect the flag. Only 11 percent of black respondents said the same. A strong majority (88 percent) of black respondents said the players were trying to call attention to unfair policing, while 67 percent of white respondents believed this was the case.
Patriotism
Let's start with polls that don't mention why NFL players are protesting and just tell respondents that players are kneeling during the national anthem in protest. These surveys tend to find that more people disapprove of the protests than approve.
According to the CBS poll, a little over half of respondents disapproved of players kneeling during the anthem, while 38 percent approved.
Similarly, in a HuffPost/YouGov poll, close to half of respondents felt the protest was inappropriate, while 36 percent thought it was appropriate.
In a separate CNN poll, when asked whether players kneeling during the anthem is the right or wrong thing, 43 percent of respondents said players were doing the right thing while 49 percent disagreed.
Without highlighting the reason for the protests, these questions either rely on the respondents' prior understanding of the situation or simply measure people's appetite for protests that use the nation's symbols. A Marist poll found that half of respondents thought failing to stand during the national anthem, regardless of why, is “disrespectful to the freedoms the anthem represents.”
And, of course, these questions tend to find people deeply split along racial lines (we'll get to the partisan splits in a moment):
Free speech
It depends somewhat on how you ask, but it turns out that despite the general resistance to the protests, a majority of Americans think players should be allowed to kneel — whether the respondents like it or not. At the least, a majority of those polled don't think NFL players should be fired for kneeling. The HuffPost/YouGov found that only 30 percent of people supported firing players who protested, and a Cato Institute survey found 38 percent support for that position, with 61 percent opposed to firing players.
Moreover, most people don't like Trump's response to the protests, in which he said NFL team owners should fire players who kneel.
This issue, of course, touches on a foundational principle of American democracy: freedom of expression. And Pew Research Center conducted a poll in February that, without mentioning the NFL protests, found that 79 percent of Americans felt that the right to conduct nonviolent protests was essential for an effective democracy and 74 percent believed in protecting the rights of those with unpopular views.
So Americans support free spech. At least in the abstract. Fifty-two percent of adults in a Marist poll and 58 percent of respondents in an Ipsos poll said professional athletes should have to stand during the anthem.
We're left with a somewhat conflicted picture, but it seems that while most people think players should have to stand during the anthem, they don't want to see players fired for failing to do so.
Race
It's not clear if pollsters would find more support for the NFL protests if polls explained what players are protesting.
A PBS NewsHour/Marist poll asked respondents if they found it respectful or disrespectful for players to kneel or lock arms during the national anthem to protest racial inequality in the U.S. The results were still divided, with 48 percent of respondents saying it was respectful and 46 percent disrespectful.
A Quinnipiac Poll conducted last October — before Trump got involved in the issue — asked respondents if they approved of athletes' sitting during the national anthem in protest of police violence against the black community. In that case, 54 percent of respondents disapproved of the protests. But 72 percent of respondents in the same poll agreed that police brutality is a problem in the U.S. and a plurality (48 percent) believed that police nationwide are generally “tougher” on black Americans than white Americans.
Other polls have found a similar split in public opinion on police violence. In 2015, an Associated Press/NORC poll found that 32 percent of Americans said police violence in the U.S. was an extremely or very serious problem, while 35 percent said it was moderately serious and 33 percent said it wasn't too serious or not a problem at all. A PRRI poll the same year found that a little over half (52 percent) of Americans feel police treat black and white Americans differently and 49 percent of Americans said incidents like the one in Ferguson, Missouri, in which police killed a black man, are part of a broader pattern, while 39 percent felt they were isolated incidents.
But if you zoom all the way out and ask whether racism is a problem generally, most Americans (58 percent) agree it's a “big problem in our society,” according to a recent poll by Pew Research Center. That's is up from 28 percent of Americans who viewed racism as a major problem in the U.S. in 2011.
On the other hand, when polls focus specifically on the Black Lives Matter movement (which started in response to police violence against African-Americans), rather than the issue of racism in general, support plummets. In a YouGov poll about Kaepernick last year, only 27 percent of respondents said they supported the movement, while 44 percent were opposed. Among black respondents, 66 percent said they approved of the movement while 52 percent of white respondents did not, with 43 percent of white respondents strongly disapproving.
So most people support NFL players kneeling when the issue is broadly defined, while simultaneously a plurality of people disapprove of Black Lives Matter.
Despite the many conflicting poll results, we can say a few things with confidence:
A plurality of Americans don't like the NFL protests — at least if they aren't told what the players' goals are. But Americans generally dislike protests involving the flag or anthem, so it's not clear how much that might affect public opinion in this case. Most Americans think racism is a problem in the abstract, but people are less likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement, which aims to stop police violence against African-Americans. Americans are broadly supportive of the importance of free speech in general, though opinions are more muddled when people are asked about kneeling during the anthem in particular.
But looking at the overall numbers obscures an important fact: Opinions on these issues are incredibly polarized by party and race. In the CBS poll, for example, 65 percent of white respondents disapproved of the protest, with 49 percent strongly disapproving, while 74 percent of black respondents approved of the protests and 50 percent strongly approved. The same poll found that 67 percent of Democrats approved while just 11 percent of Republicans felt the same way. But divides on the NFL protests mirror Americans' views on racism generally; here's what Pew found in August when it asked people whether racism is a “big problem”:
Opinions on the NFL protests change dramatically depending on which Americans are asked about them and whether the questions focus on patriotic symbols, race or free speech. But these partisan and racial divides are part of the bedrock on which this issue is playing out.
