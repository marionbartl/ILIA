I have a friend who is a teacher. A few years back they got the opportunity of a lifetime, one of their dreams come true: they got invited by the DoDDS (the Department of Defense Dependents Schools) to come work for them, teaching dependents of military personnel on military bases around the world. They were ecstatic when they got chosen for the job. They spent, I believe, the first two years in Germany, and then last year they moved them to Japan.
When the tsunami hit I was a little freaked out until I heard from them that they were ok. Then the issues started to happen with the nuclear reactors and I and a few other people started to worry again. On Thursday, March 17th I saw this on Facebook:
we are being evacuated. i should be stateside by tuesday. they'll put us to work at base schools somewhere, not sure where. don't know if or when i'll be back in japan. it's possible i'll never see the contents of my home again, and i can only bring 1 suitcase. imagine that.
Myself and everyone that knows them was so relieved, until the next day:
teachers are being told we are “essential personnel” and therefore NOT part of the voluntary evacuation. we have no idea what's going on. but for now, i am safe and warm.
I was like, wtf? Essential to what? Why the hell would they force the teachers to stay behind? What's more, it looks like families of military personnel have a better chance of bringing their pets than the teachers have of getting out of there:
The teachers of our military families' children on military bases in Japan are not being allowed to evacuate with everyone else! Schools on the bases are closed, but their jobs are being threatened if they leave on their own. Meanwhile, evacuees can bring 2 pets.
From the Stars and Stripes story, “Navy posts Q&A about ongoing voluntary departure in Japan”:
“Horses, fish, birds, and rodents are not authorized transportation.” – nor, apparently, are teachers.
I don't get it. I also don't get why, as far as I can tell, Stars and Stripes is the only one talking about this:
No CNN, no New York Times, no Washington Post, no Huffington Post, no BBC even… no one seems to want to carry this story. Why?
My prayers go out to everyone in Japan right now, but especially to those who are being told they are not allowed to leave.

The Wisconsin Badgers defeated the Tennessee Volunteers 74-62 in the opening game of the Maui Invitational.
Wisconsin Badgers 74 Tennessee Volunteers 62
A fast start and strong finish helped propel the No. 16 Wisconsin Badgers to an opening round victory in the Maui Invitational over the Tennessee Volunteers.
The Badgers (3-1) scored the first 12 points of the game, leading by as many as 17 in the first half over the Volunteers (1-2). Down 26-9, Tennessee then turned up the pressure on defense, sparking a 10-0 run to get back in the game and ultimately cutting the Badgers' lead to single digits before halftime.
Trailing 40-32 at the break, Tennessee picked up right where they left off, scoring the first 10 points of the second half and taking their first lead of the game. For awhile the score went back and forth, until Nigel Hayes free throws and a three-pointer provided a quick five point advantage for the Badgers and from there, they never looked back.
Hayes picked up their eighth double double of their career, finishing with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Bronson Koenig led all scorers with 21, connecting on all of their two-point shots at a perfect 6-6. Ethan Happ added 16 for Wisconsin.
Shembari Phillips led the way for the young Volunteers, scoring 16 points and connecting on three of their four three-point attempts.
Perhaps the turning point for the Badgers was in the second half when head coach Greg Gard went to a 3-2 zone, a sight Badgers fans are not used to, in order to slow down the athletic Volunteers and force contested outside shots. Wisconsin outscored Tennessee 28-16 in the final ten minutes of the game.
Wisconsin will play the winner of the Oregon-Georgetown game in the Maui semifinals tomorrow at 7 pm central time. The Badgers lost to Georgetown last year as part of the 2k Classic in New York. Their last meeting against Oregon came back in the 2015 NCAA Tournament when the Badgers defeated the Ducks 72-65 to advance to the Sweet 16.
Before you start scrambling to get a piece of the Facebook pie, it's worth looking at a few glaring risk factors.
Excuse me for raining on the Facebook parade, but yesterday's news about the $450 million investment by Goldman Sachs (GS) and $50 million from Russia's Digital Sky Technology didn't move me the way it seemed to move others. This despite the suggested $50 billion valuation, as big and beautiful a number as the stock market has seen in some time. I am certainly not moved in the same way it appears to have moved Goldman's own clients: the Wall Street firm has pledged to line up another $1.5 billion in sales to its high net worth investors, who are said to be champing at the bit to get a piece of the action, which starts with a $2 million minimum. Not that I have $2 million lying around, but I wouldn't buy this stock if I did.
Reason #1: Someone who knows a lot more than I do is selling. While the identities of the specific sellers remain unknown, the current consensus seems to be that most will be from venture capital investors like Accel Partners, Peter Thiel, and Greylock Partners. Maybe Mark Zuckerberg will kick in $50 million or so himself, just for some fooling around money.
But it's not a dilutive primary offering from the company. “Facebook needs no cash!” say its cheerleaders. Okay, fine. Let's just say for argument's sake that it is early stage investors who are selling. Why would they sell? Because they're in need of cash to invest somewhere else? The way the social network is talked about these days, it's the best investment opportunity in town. So why would anyone want to forsake it? And don't give me that crap about VCs being “early stage” and wanting to cash out of a “mature” investment. These people are as money hungry as any other institutional investor, and would let it ride unless….they saw something that suggested that the era of stupendous growth was over.
Facebook reached 500 million users in July. There's been no update since, even though the company had meticulously documented every new 50 million users to that point. Might the curve have crested? And let's not even talk about the fact that they don't really make much money per user — a few dollars a year at most. (Its estimated $2 billion in 2010 revenues would amount to $4 per user at that base.) I certainly haven't spent any money on the site, despite being a fairly regular visitor. And any advertiser who is trying to target me on the social network is wasting their money. But that's just me.
Reason #2: Goldman Sachs. I've got nothing against Goldman Sachs. Hell, I worked there. But when Reuters' Felix Salmon says that the Goldman investment “ratifies” a $50 billion valuation, he's only half right. That is, someone, somewhere—perhaps the Russians at DST Global—might just believe this imaginary number. (It's hard to see why, though: DST got in at a $10 billion valuation in May 2009. Facebook's user base has more than doubled since then. So its valuation should…quintuple?) But concluding that Goldman Sachs believes in a $50 billion valuation is poor reasoning. As Salmon does point out, Goldman has likely earned the lead book runner slot in any initial public offering.
Consider a 20% sale of the company in such an event – or $10 billion at today's “valuation” – and a 2% underwriting fee of $200 million. Goldman would have to share such spoils, so let's call it $100 million into their pocket. Subtracting that underwriting fee from the Goldman investment, and you could easily make the case that for a net purchase price of $350 million, Goldman's ante only values Facebook at $39 billion. Hey, that's just off by $11 billion, so don't worry about it. Buy your shares where you can get them. In other words, go open a $10 million minimum private client account at Goldman Sachs. (Who says Goldman didn't learn its lesson about shafting its own customers? This time around, they've managed to get the customers to line up the shaft themselves.)
Reason #3: Zynga. For all the success of the largely-Facebook-hosted games of Farmville and Cityville, it's hard not to wonder what the success of the anachronistic game maker Zynga really means. Do people really miss their Atari that much? I doubt there's any crossover between the people playing Farmville and those playing the technologically advanced Call of Duty: Black Ops. Which is fine – to each their own. But all the Zynga games make me think about is Wal-Mart (WMT). Which is also fine – there's nothing wrong with being compared to one of the world's most successful companies. But here's the disconnect: if Facebook's future success depends on aiming for the lowest common denominator with the most people possible, that implies pretty slim margins a la Wal-Mart. You think they're going to justify a $50 billion market capitalization through banner ads? Are you kidding me?
Reason #4: The niggling details. Important question: Just what are Facebook's numbers? Important answer: Who the hell knows? In November, Zuckerberg told the world not to hold its breath for an IPO. No worries, Mark, because I'm not. Google (GOOG), if you recall, was pretty open by the end of its life as a private company – everybody knew what it was doing and how it was doing it. Facebook (and, in the same sense, Twitter) reminds me of Kozmo.com during the dot-com boom. Kozmo, you will recall, somehow had people convinced that they were going to make tons of money doing something remarkably pedestrian – that is, delivering Ben & Jerry's by bicycle to Manhattanites. (I remember sitting in the offices of Flatiron Partners way back when. Someone ordered some ice cream on the Web, and – voila! – half an hour later some delivery guy shows up. Kind of like what would happen if you called the deli on the phone. The future was ours to see!) Facebook reportedly pulled in $2 billion in revenues in 2010. I don't know about you, but I'm disinclined to pay 25 times revenues for anything, let alone a company the finances of which I know pretty much nothing about.
Reason #5: Warren Buffett. The legendary investor cautions those looking at outsize valuations to consider one's purchase of company stock in a different way than price of an individual share, whatever it may be. They suggest one look at the total market valuation – in this case, a sketchy $50 billion – and to consider: Would you buy the whole company for that price, if you had the money? The market value of Goldman Sachs is just $88 billion. I'd take more than half that company over the whole of Facebook any day of the week. I bet Warren Buffett would too.

What does Goldman's investment in Facebook mean?
Patients taking benzodiazepines to treat psychiatric conditions should consider transitioning to other therapies because of heightened risks for dementia and death, according to clinicians from the American College of Osteopathic Neurologists and Psychiatrists.
Benzodiazepines include branded prescription drugs like Valium, Ativan, Klonopin and Xanax. This class of drug received FDA approval in the 1960s and was believed to be a safer alternative to barbiturates.
Despite new psychiatric protocols, some physicians continue to prescribe benzodiazepines as a primary treatment for insomnia, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and other ailments. A growing body of research indicates this practice could greatly increase patients' risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to Helene Alphonso, DO, Director of Osteopathic Medical Education at North Texas University Health Science Center.
"Current research is extremely clear and physicians need to partner with their patients to move them into therapies, like anti-depressants, that are proven to be safer and more effective," said Dr. Alphonso, a board-certified psychiatrist practicing in Fort Worth. "Due to a shortage of mental health professionals in rural and underserved areas, we see primary care physicians using this class of drugs to give relief to their patients with psychiatric symptoms. While compassionate, it's important to understand that a better long-term strategy is needed."
Dr. Alphonso will review current treatment protocols, outpatient benzodiazepine detox strategies and alternative anxiety treatments at OMED 15, to be held October 17-21 in Orlando. OMED is the annual medical education conference of the American Osteopathic Association.
A Canadian review of 9,000 patients found those who had taken a benzodiazepine for three months or less had about the same dementia risk as those who had never taken one. Taking the drug for three to six months raised the risk of developing Alzheimer's by 32 percent, and taking it for more than six months boosted the risk by 84 percent. Similar results were found by French researchers studying more than 1,000 elderly patients.
The case for limiting the use of benzodiazepines is particularly strong for patients 65 and older, who are more susceptible to falls, injuries, accidental overdose and death when taking the drugs. The American Geriatric Society in 2012 labeled the drugs "inappropriate" for treating insomnia, agitation or delirium because of those risks.
"It's imperative to transition older patients because we're seeing a very strong correlation between use of benzodiazepines and development of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. While correlation certainly isn't causation, there's ample reason to avoid this class of drugs as a first-line therapy," Dr. Alphonso said.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 4×20 ratchets up the stakes within the Framework, with very real consequences. Here are a few hints for “Farewell, Cruel World!”
The B-Squad returns!
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 4×20 pulls back the camera to the brave but unexperienced agents keeping the Zephyr in flight — and keeping Daisy and Simmons alive. Yo-Yo, Piper, and the rest have quite enough to deal with before the Superior starts bombarding the aircraft. Once the blitz begins, the clock starts ticking on Simmons and Daisy's time left in the Framework… and possibly, their lives.
Fitz and Simmons have their reckoning
With events coming to a head in the Framework, Simmons grows desperate to save Fitz from Aida's tentacles. But as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fans will well know, desperation has rarely been either Fitz or Simmons' friend.
The choices Jemma makes in “Farewell, Cruel World!” have drastic consequences within the Framework — and they may even echo beyond this dark, closed simulation.
Picking priorities
It's now or never for escaping the Framework, but our “woke” agents will have their hands full with the escape in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 4×20. Radcliffe's back door is not quite as easily accessed as it seems — and then there's the fact that Fitz, May, and Mack are all pretty content where they are.
Between May's skepticism, Mack's devotion to their daughter, and Fitz's evil phase, it won't be easy for Daisy, Simmons, and Coulson to convince their friends to escape the Framework. In fact, in at least one case, “not easy,” might even mean “impossible.”
Article Continues Below
The endgame becomes clear
With only three more episodes left in the season, every moment counts in “Farewell, Cruel World!” That's especially true for the episode's final moments, which unveil Aida's true desires. It's a conclusion that will have fans shrieking… but whether in delight or in despair, I dare not say.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 4×20, “Farewell, Cruel World!,” airs tonight at 10:00 p.m. on ABC.
What are your hopes and fears for ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' 4×20?
I'm going to preface this whole piece with this: This work is not meant to make fun of the blind, it was made purely on a whim, and I hope that it will accept for what it is, a work of fiction made purely for fun.
Now that the nitty gritty is done...
AND NOW A CONVOLUTED STORY: A tale brought forth by three men, alone in a room, with only chips soda and candy.
Snowdrop, a filly from the distant past, appears in Ponyville, with no rhyme or reason behind it. Strangely the residents don't kick up much of a fuss.  They are quickly accepted and given a place to stay in the library, taking up the empty position of librarian. They take to the job with gusto wanting to earn their keep, and the continued sanctity of the library. There are only two problems; she's still in school, and more importantly she's blind.
Meanwhile the Looper, a pony who has spent ages dying and reincarnating into other realities versions of him/herself, awakens to the realization that they are Snowdrop, which means accepting everything that makes her, Snowdrop, including their memories, mannerisms, and sense of self. Having seen many paths for reality to take in it's time the Looper is apathetic, wanting only to continue Snowdrop's life. Of course knowing the future, or at least a version of it always leads to trouble.
This is a joint project by Myself (Szulu), gameboy17, and SumVerendus, I say joint but really I that they were consulted closely on all the steps of the work. Anyway, a big thanks to them, hopefully the project will continue for a long time yet.

Alicia no sabe su fecha de cumpleaños, tampoco sabe leer ni escribir. Nació cerca de Juchitán, Oaxaca. Habla zapoteco y, con cierta dificultad, español. Pese a todo lo que ha sufrido, en su voz hay inocencia y ternura.
La conocí en un refugio cuando ella tenía 14 años. Estaba desnutrida y deprimida; no quería vivir. Le prometimos justicia y desde entonces la hemos acompañado. Por ello, durante los últimos seis años, hemos buscado que las autoridades hagan su trabajo y parece que por fin lo hemos conseguido. Hace unos meses Alicia recibió la noticia de la aprehensión de Margarita Jiménez López, la mujer que la esclavizó por más de dos años.
En Juchitán, Oaxaca, así como en otras regiones donde hay gran población indígena, la venta de niñas es común. Por desgracia, la condición indígena ha estado ligada durante mucho tiempo a la marginación económica y social. Víctimas de la pobreza y la discriminación, los indígenas son uno de los grupos más vulnerables a la trata de personas.
Miles de niñas indígenas son forzadas a la servidumbre. Son vendidas por sus padres en sus pueblos y trasladadas a las ciudades para hacer el trabajo doméstico en casas de las que no se les permite salir. En algunos casos, estas niñas no solo no reciben un sueldo ni una buena alimentación, sino que además son golpeadas, torturadas, amenazadas y a veces abusadas sexualmente. Alicia fue víctima de ese infierno.
Cuando tenía ocho años, su padre murió. Su madre le dijo entonces la verdad, ellos no eran su familia y ahora debía volver con sus padres reales. La habían comprado cuando era apenas una bebé pues sus padres verdaderos eran muy humildes. Alicia se mudó con su familia de sangre, pero la violencia de esa casa la hacía salir a la calle.
Conoció al dueño de un bar quien, sin pedirle su consentimiento, la compró por 20 mil pesos a sus padre. Alicia reclamó, pero nadie la escuchó. Tuvo que mudarse con él. Ese hombre abusó sexualmente de ella, la obligó a consumir drogas y la prostituyó en su bar a pesar de que era una niña. Tres años vivió Alicia de este modo.
Alicia le pidió ayuda a una tía suya que trabajaba en el bar. Embarazada, volvió a casa de sus padres. La cuidaron mientras duró el embarazo. Poco después, el padre de Alicia conoció a Margarita Jiménez López mientras ésta promovía el voto para un partido en Juchitán.
Alicia comenzó a trabajar para ella; en esta primera etapa, dice la joven, la lideresa política era muy amable. "Incluso me daba dinero para la leche de mi niño", recuerda. Sin embargo, las cosas cambiaron radicalmente cuando solicitó a los padres de Alicia llevársela a la Ciudad de México.
Alicia supo que la mujer había entregado dinero a sus padre, pero le dijeron que era para los cuidados del bebé. Más tarde supo de voz de su victimaria que en realidad ese dinero era el precio por el que la habían comprado.
La pesadilla comenzó en un departamento cuya ubicación Alicia no recuerda. Allí, Margarita y su hija Tatiana la convirtieron en su esclava. La aislaron, no podía salir de la casa ni hablar con sus padres. La insultaban y golpeaban a capricho. "Comía un día sí y un día no, solo arroz y frijoles", narra Alicia, quien en ese entonces no tenía ni 14 años. Pero había algo más terrible que la joven debía callar: Jorge, el hijo de la señora Margarita, abusaba sexualmente de ella. Él la amenazó diciendo que si le decía a alguien, la mataría a ella y a su familia.
En completa soledad, Alicia soportó este infierno. Después, debido a problemas con los vecinos que se quejaban del consumo de droga de Margarita y su hija, se mudaron a un departamento en Huixquilucan, Estado de México. Allí las cosas no mejoraron.
Alicia relata que los vecinos se daban cuenta de su situación, pero no intentaban ayudarla. Los guardias de seguridad incluso sabían que no debía salir. En una ocasión buscó apoyo de los guardias, pero éstos la encerraron en una habitación hasta que llegó la señora Margarita.
"Se siente feo cuando te pegan, es feo cuando te violan, no es justo, duele el corazón y la panza", nos dijo con la sensibilidad que la caracteriza.
Alicia no se rindió. Un día escondió los audífonos de Tatiana, pues sabía que ella llamaría para pedírselos. En efecto, poco después de salir de la casa, Tatiana llamó. La hija de la lideresa esperó en su coche a Alicia fuera del edificio y se marchó pronto sin cerciorarse de que la niña volviera al departamento. En ese momento había cambio de guardia, así que tampoco los vigilantes se fijaron en la niña.
Ya libre, Alicia descubrió que no tenía adónde ir, no sabía leer ni escribir, apenas hablaba español, nunca había caminado por una ciudad... Buscó a uno de los guardias, el único que había mostrado preocupación por ella antes. Él aceptó ayudarla y se encargó de trasladarla a un lugar donde estuviera más segura. Después, la llevó a denunciar, aunque sabía que Margarita era una mujer con influencias, aparentemente intocable.
Días después, Alicia fue canalizada a uno de los refugios especializados en víctimas de trata de personas, donde varias personas le prometimos no rendirnos hasta lograr justicia. En junio de este año, después de seis años, la lideresa política y su hija fueron aprehendidas en Juchitán, Oaxaca. Salieron libres.
Tuvieron que pasar cinco meses más para que, gracias al compromiso de los actuales gobiernos del Estado de México y Oaxaca, fueran detenidas de nuevo. Esta vez, además se consiguió la captura de su hijo Jorge García.
Estas noticias dan esperanza a Alicia y también a cada uno de nosotros. Durante años, algunas personas con poder, riquezas o influencias se han considerado intocables, han creído que tienen derecho a dañar a los demás, han pensado que pueden comprar siempre su impunidad. Esos tiempos han terminado. El caso de Alicia evidencia que hoy existen gobiernos, como el de Eruviel Ávila y el de Gabino Cué, comprometidos a erradicar la esclavitud, sin importar quién deba comparecer ante la justicia.
Esperamos que el futuro gobierno de Colima también tenga la voluntad de acabar con la trata de personas, de ahí la importancia de los acuerdos que la Comisión Unidos contra la Trata y cuatro de los seis candidatos a la gubernatura de Colima firmamos el 15 de diciembre. Invitamos únicamente a aquellos candidatos cuya trayectoria ética no está en duda, que no han sido acusados de estar vinculados con este crimen y que nunca han apoyado reformas a la Ley general contra la trata en contra de las víctimas y en favor de los delincuentes.
Exigimos a los partidos no permitir que entre sus militantes se encuentren personas que cometen este delito o que estén coludidas con redes de trata. No es una cuestión de partidos, sino de individuos. En todos los partidos encontramos gente comprometida y gente lamentablemente corrompida. Por eso, a todos los que acudirán a las urnas el siguiente año les pedimos que no vendan su voto y que elijan a los funcionarios que se merecen: hombres y mujeres que valoran a cada ser humano.
Querido lector, el año de Alicia termina lleno de esperanza. Ahora ella está segura, su corazón y su "panza" dolerán cada vez menos.
Nosotros deseamos que este 2015 para ti también concluya de forma maravillosa. En estos 12 meses tu apoyo ha sido indispensable para esta lucha por la libertad. Así que recuerda, si sabes de una víctima de trata de personas, denuncia al 018005533000 o en unidoshacemosladiferencia.com. ¡Feliz Navidad y que la paz reine en tu hogar durante 2016!
*Presidenta de la Comisión Unidos contra la Trata

A man cleared of rape is suing police and prosecutors after they failed to disclose messages that would have proved theirs innocence.
Liam Allan, 22, of south-east London, accused of 12 rapes and sex assaults, said they lived in “a terrible limbo” as police withheld 40,000 messages from their accuser.
They had faced up to 20 years in jail if guilty.
But the case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim pestered them for "casual sex", reports the Mirror.

Mr Allan, a criminology student, said they have “no choice” but to sue police and the Crown Prosecution Service, who have yet to offer an apology.
A judge at Croydon Crown Court has called for an inquiry.
The Met is investigating after a new prosecutor found the messages.
Talking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Allan said: "University is meant to be the best years of your life and the last two years have been spent worrying and not concentrating on anything.
"It has completely ripped apart my normal personal life.
"I feel relief on one side, that the case is over, but now there's the stress of getting compensation and the process of suing - so it's not over completely."

I love my wife. And I tell them “I love you”—a lot. When we wake up, when one of us leaves, when we text, when we meet up again, when we go to bed. When she's tired and uses Japanese grammar for English and sounds hilarious. When our kids are adorable. I just say it. If you were to read a transcript of our daily conversations, you'd probably determine that “I love you,” for me, no longer has any meaning or serves any purpose.
Here's the beautiful thing: you'd be right. In the beginning, of course, it meant a lot. And it did a lot. I no longer remember the details of the first time I told them (or anyone) “I love you,” but I know I planned for it. I was nervous. Guaranteed, I thought it would change things—my own sense of commitment, the atmosphere between us, how they saw me. It meant things were going to the next level.
And for a long time after, those little stories continued. I really did love her, but “I love you” was transactional. I'd say it in hopes of making them feel good, or of making me feel like a good person. Or I'd say it as a way of smoothing something over, as a reminder that everything's OK. Or because I thought, well, this is something we do now. If I didn't say it one day, I'd think that I'd failed. I'd dropped the ball.
But now? I don't expect anything from “I love you”—no magic, no reward, no orchestra. It doesn't make my wife weak in the knees; it's more like a sound I make, or like breathing. They say it too, of course. We pass the phrase back and forth, and the actual words don't seem to matter much.
When I say I love you, I don't think I mean “I love you” anymore, not really. I don't consider “I” or “you.” I've been saying this constantly for about fifteen years—now, it's shorthand for something too big and too complicated to say in words. It includes my entire sense of commitment; it's my past, and it's my direction. It's code. I like to think I also express it in lots of other, nonverbal, ways as well. But “I love you” is the most direct. It's honest. I just don't know exactly what it means anymore.
I don't know what zazen means, either, but I used to think I did. I knew what I wanted from it and what it meant about me. And I thought it was something I did—there was a subject and an object. But after twenty-five years of it, more than anything, it just feels honest. There's something we recognize in that posture—we know it when we see it, and we know it when we do it. There's peace and power and poise of a kind we intuitively grasp, and that all adds up to—something. Something I want to express. And the best way I know is to simply do it.
At the heart of Zen practice is the notion of doing something—anything, but especially zazen—for its own sake. Not for gain, not as preparation for something else, but as a complete activity.
I mention this idea when I first give instructions in zazen, but just to plant a seed. I don't expect anyone to sit in that way on the first day or the first year, or really even in the first decade. We want something from this practice. That's natural. We want enlightenment or clarity or calm, or maybe we just want to be the kind of person who does Buddhist things. We want to do it right. We want a gold star. Or total liberation, but at least a gold star.
But just because it's hard to bring a non-seeking mind to zazen doesn't mean we don't know what that is. We do, if we look. We know about doing something for its own sake.
This is my simple understanding of practice—to do something over and over, until finally it just means what it is. I love you. It's not a big deal, but it's something I need to say.
I moved to Halifax from Japan more than two years ago, and since then, much of my energy has gone into Zen Nova Scotia. Things I might otherwise have written down turned into talks—nearly a hundred of them can be found here. I'm humbled by the continued life of this blog; I want to spend more time here. And I'm grateful for the correspondences and connections that it's provided me along the way. Thank you. -koun
It's the old story: you won't notice it until it's gone. The statue of Fr Theobald Mathew, on Dublin's O'Connell Street, standing outside the Gresham Hotel, is to be removed to make way for the installation of a new Luas rail track. There are no plans to replace the clockwork-looking statue, and they will be relocated elsewhere. Many think this is a real pity, as the admonishing stone priest, urging alcohol abstention, is part of the street's familiar landscape and is, for many, too iconic a landmark to be hidden away in a square somewhere, as has been suggested.

There are no plans to replace the clockwork-looking statue, and they will be relocated elsewhere. Many think this is a real pity, as the admonishing stone priest, urging alcohol abstention, is part of the street's familiar landscape and is, for many, too iconic a landmark to be hidden away in a square somewhere, as has been suggested.
Significantly, a similar attempt in 2000 to move the famous statue of Fr Mathew in Cork caused an outcry by the local citizens and the rebel city was forced to keep them at their landmark spot, near the River Lee. But this may have been because the statue was also a well-known bus destination, just like Nelson's Pillar, which for years after its bombing in Dublin and removal continued to feature as a destination sign for the capital's buses. Such is the pivotal importance of such features on our landscape.
Luas works have also seen the removal of the statue of the poet Thomas Moore, on College Green, but they will eventually be put back. Which is just as well, given James Joyce's great line about it in Ulysses - "they did right putting them up over a urinal - meeting of the waters" (Moore's famous poem).
Joyce had many jokes about Dublin's statues and remarked on how the most Catholic country in Europe had the statues of three adulterers on its main thoroughfare - O'Connell, Parnell, and Nelson - all of them on then Sackville Street. Molly Malone has also been removed but will be put back at the bottom of Grafton Street although there have been silly calls for them to go to Moore Street.
I'm familiar with many of the stories and jokes concerning the city's statues, given that my late father, Edward, created two of them, notably Wolfe Tone in front of their stone columns on St Stephen's Green, nicknamed 'Tonehenge', and the Thomas Davis statue and fountain on College Green, also known as 'Urination Once Again'.
But the design of these memorials was very seriously thought out. Davis was depicted as an ordinary man on a plinth, a scholar and poet not a colonial overlord, and Tone was put at ground level, a true Republican whom people could touch. There was to be no gun or sword; they were to be an Irish Everyman. Night time revellers often even now put a scarf around Tone's neck, or a glass in their hand, as they do with the Patrick Kavanagh statue by the Grand Canal or the corresponding Brendan Behan statue on the Royal Canal, both seated figures by sculptor John Coll.
Meanwhile, in College Green students regularly put soap into the Davis fountain, causing foaming bubbles to pour out on to the street. On St Patrick's Day, the water has even been dyed green and for Gay Pride it has been coloured pink. Such is the interactive nature of our city's (and country's) memorials and statues, which we too often take for granted and yet we pass them every day.
These artworks tell us much about ourselves. The statues of Davis and Tone were erected in 1966-67 to mark that decade's relative prosperity and the 50 years since the Easter Rising. But the nationalist monuments on O'Connell Street were created much earlier, and show how, even before 1916 or any Home Rule bill, much of the push for independence was already fulfilled, with Catholic and nationalist population now in control of the local government. The Parnell monument was put up in 1911, after a long gestation (the struggle to erect a memorial was often directly paralleled with the struggle for independence). This transfer of power took place not through bloodshed, but via the peaceful tactics of both O'Connell and Parnell. "Let no man put a boundary to the march of a nation," exclaims the Charles Stewart Parnell statue, pointing to the nearest maternity hospital!
The O'Connell monument was designed by the famous Victorian sculptor John Henry Foley (who also did the Fr Mathew statue in Cork) and it was unveiled to enormous crowds in 1882. Such is the potency of statues that they are often physically attacked by the political foes of their subjects. The O'Connell statue was attacked by loyalists in 1969 and their grave was also later attacked. In 1971, my father's Wolfe Tone statue was bombed and shattered in a sudden night time attack. All that was left was the two stumps of legs and the newspaper cartoonists had a field day. It is said that after the bombing, criticism of the statue, which had caused considerable controversy because of it's modernity, suddenly stopped and Dubliners now rallied around their besieged statue. My father, who got paid again for the rebuild, cheekily claimed that the repair job actually gave them a chance to make a few improvements.
In many ways, the Loyalist attackers were only emulating Irish nationalists and republicans who had a long tradition of attacking the colonial statues that often dominated the city, such as the rather provocative King William of Orange statue on College Green and King George II in St Stephen's Green. Both of these statues were on horses - there were also such statues of Viscount Hugh Gough and King George 1 - and though their destruction was understandable, it also meant that there is now no equestrian statue in Dublin, which is a strange omission for a country in love with the horse. The removed statue of Gough on their magnificent charger, a particularly fine sculpture, was eventually sold off by the OPW, on condition that it left the country. The sculpture of Queen Victoria, which once sat outside Leinster House, was also sold overseas, and now sits outside Sydney Town Hall. The Australians have no problem with commemorating where we've come from.
Further symbolism occurred when King William's spot on College Green was eventually given over to Thomas Davis, with an accompanying fountain depicting the four heralds of Ireland and their poems about Irish history. In Easter week 1966, it was unveiled by President Eamonn de Valera in an elaborate ceremony.
There is no statue of De Valera in Dublin, and nor of any other prominent figure from the later period of the Independence struggle (1916-1922). Their names were more likely to be given to streets or ambitious housing schemes. There is not even a road named after De Valera. The old Blueshirt joke was that they couldn't find a road that was long enough nor winding enough to name after him.
On the 60th anniversary of the Rising, in 2006, at the height of the boom, the Thomas Davis memorial was re-unveiled by the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in a confident, wary and even prophetic speech about modern Ireland, and where it was going. Like the rest of us, our statues have seen, and heard, it all.
Indo Review
President-elect Donald Trump speaks to the press with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell following a meeting at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 10. Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images
Hours after video emerged of Donald Trump boasting about committing sexual assault, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized Trump's comments as “repugnant” and “unacceptable.” But were they disqualifying? McConnell wouldn't say—until nearly a month later, when, days before the election, they declared that “we need a new president, Donald Trump, to be the most powerful Republican in America.”
The first part of McConnell's wish came true: America got a new president in Donald Trump. Whether the second part came to pass remains up for debate. On paper, Trump may be America's most powerful Republican—but that's only because McConnell has allowed them to take that role. And as soon as they tire of the current arrangement, McConnell can swiftly reclaim the power they have ceded. McConnell, after all, mastered Trump's nihilistic brand of politics years ago; they are, in a sense, a proto-Trump, with the same nihilistic thirst for power that drove Trump to the Oval Office.  They are much better at this game than Trump. And if Trump attempts to defy or depose McConnell, they will not simply fail: They will put their presidency at risk.
Although Trump and McConnell come across as polar opposites at first glance—McConnell's stiff, dry demeanor is worlds away from Trump's shambling vulgarity—their histories and philosophies rhyme in curious ways. Like Trump, McConnell had a pronounced liberal bent early in their political career, supporting abortion rights and unions. Like Trump, McConnell had no problem jettisoning these beliefs when they realized the Republican Party was turning fiercely against them. Like Trump, McConnell routinely attacks their opponents on dubious grounds: They notoriously attacked one rival for missing critical Senate votes for paid speeches (he hadn't, though McConnell later did), insinuated that another was gay (he was actually just single), and suggested in television ads that a popular challenger was addicted to “mood-altering,” “powerful depressants” (he wasn't).
Long before Trump started questioning Barack Obama's birthplace, McConnell had perfected the kind of baseless personal attacks that, through the force of pure repetition, gain an aura of plausibility. But just as importantly, McConnell had coupled this viciousness with a total ideological flexibility whose sheer audacity seemed to somehow mask its rank hypocrisy. McConnell proposed a constitutional amendment to limit money in politics, then decided that the First Amendment protects unlimited and anonymous political spending and contributions. They voted for another constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning before deciding that flag desecration is free speech. They took a hard line against China before receiving huge sums from Chinese donors, at which point they became a vociferous advocate for normalizing Chinese relations. Indeed, as Alec MacGillis documents in their indispensable McConnell biography The Cynic, virtually all of McConnell's political convictions seem to derive from how much money any particular vote will bring him.
It may go without saying that similarly stark reversals define Trump's political climb. Trump was pro-choice and pro-gay before deciding that Roe and Obergefell were wrongly decided. They supported open borders before they became an immigration hard-liner. They encouraged the invasion of Iraq then insisted they opposed the war from the start. Politico once quipped that Trump has “turned the self-contradiction into an art form.” The list of reversals is too exhausting to document fully—which, of course, plays to Trump's advantage.
McConnell, too, knows that the truth is vastly overrated and that conventional wisdom overestimates the value of consistency. These insights are coupled with an overwhelming drive for power, no matter the collateral consequences. After Obama's election, McConnell, then Senate minority leader, notoriously proclaimed that their “No. 1 priority” was making Obama a “one-term president.” They did not embark upon this mission because they personally loathed Obama or feared their progressive politics. They did it because Obama's popularity stood between them and their lifelong dream of becoming Senate majority leader, a dream that could not be realized so long as Senate Democrats were buoyed by their president's popularity. McConnell explained the strategy to their caucus with remarkable candor. A fellow senator, the late Robert Bennett, recalled for MacGillis what McConnell had said:
We have a new president with an approval rating in the seventy percent area. We do not take them on frontally. We find issues where we can win, and we begin to take them down, one issue at a time. We create an inventory of losses, so it's Obama lost on this, Obama lost on that. And we wait for the time where the image has been damaged to the point where we can take them on. We recognize the American people—even those who do not approve of him—want them to have success, are hopeful.
As MacGillis paraphrases this pep talk: “Wait out Americans' hopefulness in a dire moment for the country until it curdles into disillusionment.”
McConnell's campaign of obstruction flowed from this plan. Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, deployed the filibuster with unprecedented frequency, blocking routine appointments to agencies, courts, and ambassadorships. McConnell pressured moderate Republicans to refuse any compromises over health care, stimulus, Wall Street reform, and gun safety measures, and to join the blockade of key Obama appointees for little reason other than a raw showing of force. This part of the story is familiar, and it's especially poignant today, since McConnell's obstruction allowed Trump to inherit more than 100 judicial vacancies that were Obama's to fill, including a Supreme Court seat.
The animating intuition of McConnell's obstructionism is that the overwhelming majority of Americans do not much care about Senate. They do not care about its traditions or daily functions. They do not care about speeches or filibusters. They do not care about amendments and debates and reconciliations and all the parliamentary maneuvers that, by all accounts, fascinate McConnell to no end. Most Americans care only that the Senate “works”—that it performs its basic functions without collapsing into partisan squabbles.
McConnell recognized this fact early on, and also saw that when the Senate seems not to be working, Americans tend to blame the president. So, as minority leader, they brought the Senate to a grinding halt, then blamed Obama and the Democrats for their handiwork. This gambit was wildly successful, sowing anger and frustrating toward Democrats, and allowing McConnell to accrue an immense amount of power despite their deep unpopularity, both in Kentucky and nationally.
The animating intuition of Trump's rise to power was that Americans' indifference toward politics runs a lot deeper than perhaps even McConnell realized. As it turns out, a huge chunk of the electorate does not care whether politicians hold regular press conferences or release financial disclosures or refrain from saying horribly bigoted things on TV. It doesn't matter if a presidential candidate mocks or vilifies disabled people and women and immigrants. It doesn't matter if they release coherent policy papers and adheres to clear positions on important issues. Americans—or, rather, a majority of the ones who matter, thanks to the Electoral College—just don't give a damn about the formalities of politics that the overpaid consultants told us were crucial. Or at least, they don't give a damn when your name is Donald Trump.
But whereas McConnell developed their theory of the Senate carefully, over the course of years, Trump essentially stumbled into their own discovery all at once, then coasted to the top on a wave of dumb luck. And that is the principal distinction between the two men. Trump is an imbecile; McConnell is a genius. Trump's idiocy leads to a near-constant stream of unforced errors; McConnell almost never makes a misstep and calculates the risk of every action. At some point, Trump's luck will run out; McConnell's ingenuity will not.
That should terrify Trump, because once McConnell decides that Trump is no longer useful to him, they will turn on him. If Trump becomes mired in scandals that threaten to hurt the Republican Party—or challenges the supremacy of the legislature over the executive—his agenda will be in serious trouble. McConnell has little use for an unpopular president, even a Republican one, who won't cooperate with their plans. And if they do foil even part of Trump's agenda and bring Washington into gridlock again, Americans will not blame him. They will blame President Donald Trump.
Therein lies McConnell's ace in the hole. They know the game Trump is playing and has played a version of it himself. They broadly agree with Trump's desire, mostly unarticulated during the campaign but apparent in their actions since, to slash the social safety net and nullify minority rights. If Trump cooperates with McConnell, plays by the rules McConnell lays out—in short, treats the Senate as the ultimate arbiter of the Republican agenda—then the two will get along just fine. But if Trump steps too far out of line with McConnell, the wooden senator from Kentucky will quietly ensure that the president suffers. Trump may be “the most powerful Republican in America.” But they will only hold that title for as long as McConnell lets him.
Last week, Unilever Israel admitted that some of its flagship breakfast cereals contained salmonella and that they had initially withheld that information from the public and the Ministry of Health. Thursday night, contrary to their previous statements, Unilever, admitted that some infected boxes had reached supermarket shelves. In response, Minister of Health Rabbi Yakov Litzman condemned their actions and threatened to pull their license.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
Speaking Friday morning, Litzman said, "Unilever failed in management, lied to the public and the Ministry of Health, and we take this seriously. We are considering revoking its production-line license. We can't trust them. Teams from the ministry are investigating the serious case that includes damage to public health."

The minister's condemnation came the morning after Unilever reported to their ministry that despite their repeated claims that all the infected cereals had never reached the public, some 240 infected units, out of a total of some 150,000 that had been infected, had actually left the factory. The ministry dubbed this "negligent" on Thursday night, and their official statement also threatened to revoke Unilever's license.
The Ministry is opening an investigation to check how the tainted units came onto the market, the results of which will be released to the public, including recommendations for avoiding similar cases in the future.
Unilever Israel CEO Anat Gabriel released a statement on the affair on Thursday night: "I apologize from the bottom of my heart for the recent events…We apologize that we mistakenly announced that no product from the tainted line had reached the market." They elaborated that they had learned only Wednesday that this was mistaken and that they were working to recall any affected cereals and to implement new procedures to prevent recurrences.
Until recently, same-sex couples could not legally marry. Now, some are finding they must wed if they want to keep their partner's job-based health insurance and other benefits.
With same-sex marriage now legal in 35 states and the District of Columbia, some employers that formerly covered domestic partners say they will require marriage licenses for workers who want those perks.
“We're bringing our benefits in line, making them consistent with what we do for everyone else,” said Ray McConville, a spokesperson for Verizon, which notified non-union employees in July that domestic partners in states where same-sex marriage is legal must wed if they want to qualify for such benefits.
Employers making the changes say that since couples now have the legal right to marry, they no longer need to provide an alternative. Such rule changes could also apply to opposite-sex partners covered under domestic partner arrangements.
“The biggest question is: Will companies get rid of benefit programs for unmarried partners?” said Todd Solomon, a partner at McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago.
It is legal for employers to set eligibility requirements for the benefits they offer workers and their families — although some states, such as California, bar employers from excluding same-sex partners from benefits. But some benefit consultants and advocacy groups say there are legal, financial and other reasons why couples may not want to marry.
Requiring marriage licenses is “a little bossy” and feels like “it's not a voluntary choice at that point,” said Jennifer Pizer, senior counsel at Lambda Legal, an organization advocating for gay, lesbian and transgender people.
About two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies offer domestic partner benefits, but only a minority is changing the rules to require tying the knot, said Deena Fidas, director of the workplace equality program at the advocacy group Human Rights Campaign.
Because same-sex marriage isn't legal in all states, “many employers operating in multiple states … are retaining their partner benefit structures,” said Fidas.
Most companies making the changes, including Verizon, are doing so only in those states where same-sex couples can get married. And most give workers some time to do it.
“We gave them a year and a quarter to get married,” said Jim Redmond, spokesperson for Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, which made the change for employees shortly after New York allowed same-sex unions.
Employers that offer domestic partner benefits — for both same-sex and opposite-sex partners — generally allow couples in committed relationships to qualify for health and other benefits upon providing documents, such as financial statements, wills, rental agreements or mortgages, proving they are responsible for each other financially.
Such benefits were particularly important before the federal health law barred insurers from rejecting people with pre-existing medical conditions.
“We had clients over the years who were living with HIV … the only health insurance they had, or had hope of getting was their partner's, through a job,” said Daniel Bruner, director of legal services at the Whitman-Walker Health clinic in Washington, D.C. “Now folks have more health insurance options.”
After the Supreme Court ruled the federal Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional in 2013, the portion of the health insurance premium paid by employers on behalf of the same-sex spouse was no longer taxable under federal rules, although state taxes often applied where such marriages were not legal. When state marriage laws change, so do those tax rules.
In Arizona, Dena Sidmore and their wife, Cherilyn Walley are saving more than $300 a month in taxes on the health insurance from Walley's state job, which covers them both. The savings came after the state's same-sex marriage bar was thrown out by the courts in October.
They didn't marry for benefits. They already had coverage under domestic partner requirements affecting Arizona state workers. They simply wanted to be married. Indeed, they tied the knot in September 2013, after driving all night to Santa Fe, N.M., where same-sex marriage was legal.
“It was lovely,” Sidmore said of the ceremony at the courthouse. But for her, the real change came when Arizona's bar on same-sex marriage was overturned by the courts. They remember thinking: “This is real. It's not just a piece of paper.”
After the courts lifted the same-sex marriage ban, Arizona dropped its domestic partner program. State workers had until the end of last year to marry if they wanted to keep a partner on benefits.
Sidmore has no objection to employers requiring a marriage license for benefits because “spousal benefits require marriage,” although they think there should be exceptions for older residents who might face the loss of pensions or other financial complications if they remarry.
Benefit experts recommend that employers consider what it might mean for workers if benefits are linked to marital status — especially those that operate in states where same-sex marriage is not legal.
While some couples, like Sidmore and Walley, may be willing to travel to tie the knot, others may not want to, or may be unable to afford it. Additionally, some workers may fear if they marry, then move or get transferred to a state where same-sex marriage is barred, they would face discrimination.
Joe Incorvati, a managing director at KPMG in New Jersey, married their partner, Chuck, in 2013 when it became an option. “We'd been together for 38 years, so it just seemed natural,” they said.
KPMG offers domestic partner benefits and does not require employees to be married for eligibility. While he's comfortable in New Jersey, Incorvati said it could be a problem if their company wanted to transfer them to a state where same-sex marriage is not legal.
Even though their work benefits would remain the same, “Would I have the same rights as in New Jersey?” Incorvati asked. “The answer may be no.”

I had been mulling over this idea for a long time, when, a few years back, I realized that I was making a huge mistake in my approach to JavaScript. You should take it just as seriously as Java, C# or Ruby.Diseases are something you pick up, JavaScript is something you have to learn.Just like other programming languages, you need a book , programming exercises and multiple projects. JavaScript also needs coding style guides, testing frameworks, and code analysis , and so on. Basically everything that you have a "real code". There are complete solutions like Yeoman and JHipster that will help you with full integration.Unless you do this, you will always end up hating JavaScript - which is a shame considering that JavaScript is all around you! If you follow best practices, most of the time you won't be debugging any code nor resorting to clever tricks. Unless you're Chuck, that is.
In my work assisting teams with JavaScript related problems, I've noticed some common issues. If you're experiencing frustrations with the language too, this article might be of some assistance. Disclaimer: a few of my tips might be obvious to some of you, but hopefully you'll find at least some useful nuggets of information here! These pointers are especially useful when dealing with enterprise applications and CMS solutions. This is where we have our code, the CMS code, the code from that team nobody wants to mention...and, of course, all of them are loaded asynchronously.This is one of the most underused features when dealing with JavaScript, especially since it's supported by the majority of browsers. The debugger statement was part of the first edition of ECMA Script so it's been here for quite some time.Fundamentally it's a simple way of adding a breakpoint. If we have code where we loop over an element list and then process the elements......we can add the debugger statement inside the loop so that we have a breakpoint on each iteration:The triggering of the breakpoint happens when the execution of the code is done in the place where we have added it. In cases where there is no debugger handler - for example in most browsers without dev tools - this statement has no effect.On the dev tools side, it will appear as if we have manually placed the breakpoint.Of course, this is not for code you want to leave in production, but it is an extremely useful feature during the development period. It has been a life changing feature for me, especially when dealing with the vendor based JavaScript and a whole lot of callbacks.

(Nanowerk News) Two nanosatellites were launched from Yasny, Russia, at 15:11:11 Eastern Daylight Time today by Anthony Moffat, of the University of Montreal and the Centre for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec, and the Canadian research and technology team they lead. Costing a fraction of conventional space telescopes and similar in size and weight to a car battery, the satellites are two of six that will work together to shed light on the structures and life stories of some of the brightest stars in the sky, uncovering unique clues as to the origins of our own Sun and Earth.

Together, the satellites are known as the BRITE-Constellation, standing for BRIght Target Explorer. BRITE-Constellation will monitor for long stretches of time the brightness and colour variations of most of the brightest stars visible to the eye in the night sky. These stars include some of the most massive and luminous stars in the Galaxy, many of which are precursors to supernova explosions. This project will contribute to unprecedented advances in our understanding of such stars and the life cycles of the current and future generations of stars, said Professor Moffat, who is the scientific mission lead for the Canadian contribution to BRITE and current chair of the international executive science team.
Luminous stars dominate the ecology of the Universe. During their relatively brief lives, massive luminous stars gradually eject enriched gas into the interstellar medium, adding heavy elements critical to the formation of future stars, terrestrial planets and organics. In their spectacular deaths as supernova explosions, massive stars violently inject even more crucial ingredients into the mix. The first generation of massive stars in the history of the Universe may have laid the imprint for all future stellar history, Moffat explained. Yet, massive stars  rapidly spinning and with radiation fields whose pressure resists gravity itself - are arguably the least understood, despite being the brightest members of the familiar constellations of the night sky. Other less-massive stars, including stars similar to our own Sun, also contribute to the ecology of the Universe, but only at the end of their lives, when they brighten by factors of a thousand and shed off their tenuous outer layers.
BRITE-Constellation is in fact a multinational effort that relies on pioneering Canadian space technology and a partnership with Austrian and Polish space researchers  the three countries act as equal partners. Canadas participation was made possible thanks to an investment of $4.07 million by the Canadian Space Agency. The two new Canadian satellites are joining two Austrian satellites and a Polish satellite already in orbit; the final Polish satellite will be launched in August.
All six satellites were designed by the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies - Space Flight Laboratory, who also built the Canadian pair. The satellites are been in fact named BRITE Toronto and BRITE Montreal after the University of Toronto and the University of Montreal, who play a major role in the mission. BRITE-Constellation will exploit and enhance recent Canadian advances in precise attitude control that have opened up for space science the domain of very low cost, miniature spacecraft, allowing a scientific return that otherwise would have had price tags 10 to 100 times higher, Moffat said. This will actually be the first network of satellites devoted to a fundamental problem in astrophysics.
The nanosatellites will be able to explore a wide range of astrophysical questions. The constellation could detect exoplanetary transits around other stars, putting our own planetary system in context, or the pulsations of red giants, which will enable us to test and refine our models regarding the eventual fate of our Sun, Moffatt explained.
Outdoor loving photographers who are often far away from power grids don't have too many options when it comes to charging up their gear. Without a generator you're pretty much left with batteries and solar chargers.
But the guys behind the FlameStower didn't like either of those options, so they came up with a third. Instead of using batteries or the sun, they decided to use fire.
Team FlameStower consists of grad school buddies Andy Bynes and Adam Kell, who came up with the idea in Bynes' garage. Built to be ultra-portable, the little gadget turns heat from a flame into electricity that it can pump into any electronic device with a USB charger.
Obviously you won't be powering any softboxes this way, but if you're out in the middle of nowhere, any camera you can charge via USB can benefit from the FlameStower. And, of course, even if that's not an option, there's always your camera phone.
Unlike solar chargers the FlameStower can work at any time of day or night. All you have to do is unfold it, set one end up over a flame, and fill the cup on the other with water. The heat from the fire transfers to the generator, the water bath keeps the other end of the generator cool, and the temp difference creates electricity. That's it!
Here's a quick video demo of the FlameStower in action:
It's an ingenious idea that's ready to get off the ground minus the funding required for mass manufacturing. And so, the duo have started a Kickstarter that reached its goal in just a few days time. With 22 days left, every early bird special is gone and Team FlameStower has raised almost $24,000 (with an original goal of just $15,000).
If you want to get your own, or learn more about the little fire-powered charger, head over to the group's website or Kickstarter page by clicking the corresponding links. Getting a FlameStower will cost you a minimum pledge of $80, and Bynes and Kell promise to have it in your hands in time for Christmas.

A nationally known arson expert who had been scheduled to testify before a Texas panel probing an investigation that may have led to the death of an innocent man has slammed Governor Rick Perry's handling of the case.
In an email to an official for the Texas Forensic Science Commission, Craig Beyler called for the appointment of the panel members ousted by Perry last month, and the resignation of the new members that Perry appointed in their place. And they said that Perry, a Republican, should recuse themselves from making appointments to the panel because — having signed off on the execution despite a last minute bid from the convicted man's lawyer for a postponement — the governor has a “conflict of interest.”Just days ahead of Beyler's scheduled testimony before the commission early this month, Perry declined to reappoint the panel's chair, as well as two other members whose terms were expiring. Perry appointed a new chair, who abruptly canceled Beyler's planned testimony.
The ousted chair, Sam Bassett, has said they were pressured by Perry aides about the direction of the commission's probe.
Wrote Beyler to commission coordinator Leigh Tomlin and to Bassett:
Sadly, the political influence which has been exercised with respect to the commission has compromised the integrity of the enterprise.
They added:
[Perry] had a personal role in the Willingham case. Under these circumstances, they should have recused themselves from making appointments. Their failure to recuse themselves is both unethical and injurious to the cause of justice.
In an interview with the Fort-Worth Telegram, Beyler said they don't “have any illusions” that the new members will resign. But they said they wrote the email because they were concerned that Perry's moves and the furor they've generated could “eat away at the credibility of the commission.”
They added: “Something has to happen to get that credibility back.”
Of course, Beyler is an arson expert, not a lawyer or a judge. But their claim that Perry has a conflict and should recuse themselves from having anything to do with the panel appears to mark the first time that that argument has been made explicitly by a player in the controversy.
On Wednesday, Perry defended their handling of the case, (classily) calling the executed man, Cameron Willingham, a “monster,” and dismissing the controversy over Beyler's canceled testimony and the panel's change in personnel as a “media sideshow.”
Manus Island: Eight arrested after breakout at PNG immigration detention centre
Updated
Immigration Minister Scott Morrison says 35 asylum seekers escaped from the Manus Island detention centre last night but were quickly recaptured.
Mr Morrison says the breakout happened about 6:15pm (local time) and was the result of "much-heightened" tensions at the facility.
They say a fence and power pole were damaged during the escape.
"Within about an hour and a quarter, control was restored to the centre," they said.
"All things were quiet last night."
Eight asylum seekers have been arrested and 19 have been treated at the centre's medical clinic, but Mr Morrison says none of the patients are "exhibiting life-threatening conditions".
Mr Morrison says they do not know how the asylum seekers were injured.
"It is a situation on Manus, where people don't want to be there," they told Fairfax Radio.
"You need to manage those tensions and those tensions were much-heightened last night.
"But that situation has been brought under control and we know where everybody is, I'm advised, and every one of our own people is safe."
Manus Island MP Ronnie Knight earlier told the ABC that seven people had been arrested in connection with what their local staff told them was a brawl at the facility.
"It was not a breakout or a riot or anything as such," they said earlier.
"Apparently yesterday afternoon there was an altercation amongst the asylum seekers themselves and it was very, very violent."
Protest occurred over resettlement prospects, says advocate
Local doctor Otto Numan said health workers had told them there was a "mass breakout", but they added that no injured asylum seekers or guards had been brought to hospital.
The Australian-based Refugee Action Coalition put out a statement last night saying protests at the centre had escalated earlier that day.
Manus Island Located in northern Papua New Guinea
Island is 100km long, 30km wide
Population 50,000
Largest city is Lorengau
Detention centre first opened 2001, reopened 2012
Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul says they have spoken to some people inside the Manus Island detention centre.
They say they were told the protest happened after they were told their prospects of resettlement in another country were bleak.
"The things escalated from there. There were some fires set," they said.
"I don't know the extent of the damage. We were told some tents had been burnt.
"Some people had jumped over internal fences and then later, towards six o'clock, the outer perimeter of the fence was breached and people did leave the compound."
Morrison says PNG resettlement deal still stands
Mr Morrison has rejected suggestions that the trouble was triggered by further uncertainty about where asylum seekers would be resettled if they were found to be refugees.
They say the deal, struck by former prime minister Kevin Rudd, for Papua New Guinea to take them in permanently still stands.
"That is the commitment that [PNG prime minister] Peter O'Neill gave to Kevin Rudd, that is the agreement they say they will honour," they said.
"But the difficulties of having that put in place, I've mentioned before. There wasn't a lot of detail negotiated by the previous government - we've been salvaging all of that.
"But I can assure you they're not coming to Australia and the commitments we have from PNG is they'll be resettled there."
Prime Minister Tony Abbott said this morning that they still expect the asylum seekers can be permanently resettled.
"Prime minister Peter O'Neill has reassured me repeatedly that the same deal that was on offer to the former government remains on offer," they told ABC's RN Breakfast.
"My understanding is that there has been no such information given to people that they'll never be resettled in PNG."
Application processing has begun, says PNG foreign minister
PNG's foreign minister Rimbink Pato says officials have started processing refugee applications.
But the country does not have a visa category for refugees and there has been little public information about how, and where, they might be resettled.
Mr Pato told PNG's parliament last week that they would seek the help of the Australian Government and the United Nations in deciding whether to resettle refugees within the country.
They said the option of resettling refugees in a third country would also be explored.
"So what the cabinet has decided recently is to appoint a group of eminent Papua New Guineans who will be assisted by relevant expertise from the UN, from the Australian Government, and other responsible stakeholders, to come up with relevant policy framework determining the question whether those asylum seekers will or will not be settled in PNG," they said.
The Manus Island detention centre was first set up by the Howard government in 2001.
It was closed by the Labor government in 2008 but reopened by them in November 2012.

Guitar chord formulas chart Chord symbols and notation explained
When approaching for the first time harmony and chords, often guitar players are overwhelmed by strange symbols and formulas. Chord symbols, and especially Jazz chord symbols, at first are not easy to digest.
Chords are basically a set of intervals stacked one on the top of another. And what's an interval? An interval is a distance between two notes. Depending on the qualities of those intervals, we can have different kinds of chords, and then different chords formulas. Showing the intervals composing a chord in table form is a great aid for understanding chord formulas and structure. On this page, you find a useful chord formula chart that will help you understand what's behind chord notation.
To learn how chords are constructed on the fretboard, check also our guitar music theory tutorial.
Chord Symbols and Formulas
In the following charts, for each chord you find its symbol (major, minor, 7, 9 etc) and the intervals composing the chord (1,3,5,6, etc). The number between parenthesis are optional tones that you can use in the chord. Then you see a chart composed of colored boxes. Each box corresponds to one of the semitones (half-steps) composing the octave, starting from the root. In case of extended chords (those with 9th, 11th or 13th) there is another boxes chart, that represents the upper octave.

Police are seeking the public's help in identifying four suspects linked to the robbery last week of a south-end jewelry store.
During the heist, one of the men carried an aerosol can, which they sprayed and lit with a small torch, police say to possibly intimidate the staff.
At about 4:20 p.m. on Jan. 16, a man walked into a jewelry store on Bank Street between Walkley and Heron roads and held the door open for three masked men. The first suspect then left.
The remaining suspects smashed a number of display cases with hammers and made off with a variety of jewelry.
There were no injuries.
The suspects are described as follows:
Suspect #1, who initially entered, is of Middle Eastern descent, with short dark hair, with a dark moustache, short beard and a pinch on their lower lip and chin. They wore dark sunglasses, a large watch on the right wrist, a winter coat with large fur trim hood, dark pants and shoes.
Suspect #2 was worn a dark lightweight Adidas jacket, with dark green stripes on sleeves, with the hood up, black shoes, black gloves, white socks. They carried a large black or grey duffel bag.
Suspect #3 was masked but described as Caucasian. They wore grey track pants, with a black thick stripe on the lower portion of the outer pant leg near the ankle, black gloves, and black shoes. They carried a black and grey knapsack.
Suspect #4 was masked and described as Caucasian. They wore black sweatpants with a white stripe down the leg, a red/black jacket with a hood, black gloves. They carried a red Goodlife bag.
Anyone with information on the robbery is asked to call the Ottawa police robbery unit at 613-236-1222, ext. 5116. Anonymous tips can be made to Crime Stoppers toll-free at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS), or by downloading the Ottawa Police app.

It's time for another edition of "The Question" - We Want Insanity's weekly answer to something we all have our own opinion on. See what we have to say and then share your own. That's what questions like this are for...
What Are Your Three Favorite Cover Songs?
This was a tricky question to navigate. Finding the best cover song (a tune originally performed by one musician and then by another) is a stacked deck. For starters, there are a number of famous titles that many don't even realize are covers. So, for the sake of my answer, I decided to focus on hits that were made famous first and covered later rather than the “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”s of the world that will make people go, “Oh snap. That's a cover.” When the Internet first started offering us free music through sketchy geocities downloads, I became obsessed with punk covers. Less Than Jake, MXPX, and others all took big songs and made them their own. One, however, stood out. It's perhaps the biggest punk cover band ever, Me First and The Gimme Gimmes , with a hit that no one would associate with punk music…until they hear this:
The next one is from one of my favorite bands. The Postal Service are known for their minimalistic approach and Death Cab For Cutie style. But when they took Phil Collins's “Against All Odds” and morphed it into a unique Indy band anthem, everyone took notice. It's the reason why covers exist in the first place.
My third choice shows why being the person to physically post these articles gives me an advantage over Dan and J.B. This song literally came up on my Facebook feed yesterday. It's one of my favorite vocalists – Amy Lee from Evanescence – covering one of my favorite 80s songs – With or Without You by U2 – in the most haunting and amazing way. If you haven't heard it yet, hear it now.
Oh, and this batshit insane version of Charles in Charge that has stuck with me for over 20 years…
“Respect” by Aretha Franklin (originally by Otis Redding) I can't start off a list like this without giving “The Queen of Soul” Ms. Aretha Franklin (I always say their name while invoking the spirit of Vince McMahon circa “Wrestlemania 3”) much due praise and, dare I say, respect. In 1967, Aretha Franklin took a rather unpopular Otis Redding song they created two years prior and put their spin on it in the only way they knew how – masterfully. Not only was it a hit, but “Respect” (make sure you spell it out) became greatly associated with the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s that is still being felt today as women fight for gender equality in various forms of industry and in domestic situations – allowing the song to be the complete opposite of Redding's version that told the story of a desperate man trying to get their “due” respect from their significant other at home. Forget all the crying & wining, Otis, Aretha's about kicking down barriers and demanding them some respect!
“All Along the Watchtower” by Jimi Hendrix (originally by Bob Dylan) I'm a little biased when it comes to Jimi Hendrix with them being my favorite musician of all time. Almost everything they touched sounds like audio gold to me. So color me surprised when my dad informed me that it was originally a Bob Dylan song. Released only six months after Dylan's version, The Jimi Hendrix Experience's rendition completely cut the rug from underneath Dylan before it even got settled. Surprisingly enough, the master musician that is Bob Dylan actually wasn't upset about being outclassed and started playing their rendition of Hendrix's version! How many musicians can say they influenced the creator enough to change the way he/she played their own song? The Jimi Hendrix Experience could, and for good reason.
“Forty-Six & 2” by Kids of O'Keefe Music Foundation (originally by Tool) This is the only song on my list not done by a mainstream musician. This is also the only song on my list not performed by adults. I'm a huge Tool fan and enjoy finding various bands attempting to put their spin on the amazing work the California based quartet has produced since 1990. Last year I happened to see a column on some random site praising a group of pre-teens and teens alike covering one of the singles from Tool's second LP. These talented kids didn't change the lyrics or musical structure. Instead they just played to the best of their abilities and garnered a sound as impressive if not more so than the original. It's absolutely amazing and these musicians are the future of music for sure.
I love to cover songs. There are nights I spend hours on YouTube looking up different versions of classic songs. For me, a really great cover song has to be as good or better than the original, and it needs to have its own feel. That is, it can't just sound like the original with a different singer. The artist covering the song has to do something new with it. Tori Amos, though not on my short list, is a master of this. They can take just about any pop song and turn it into a brooding lament that gives new meaning to the lyrics. Not only did I keep that criteria for this list, but I also tried to pick things that weren't totally obvious. That's why you won't find Johnny Cash's version of “Hurt.” Everyone knows that's a great cover, but I want to leave you with something new. It's a three song list. I had to leave off a lot of stuff that I love, and if this were another day, I might have another list. But, here we go. 3. Leonard Cohen has written some of the most beautiful songs in the English language. Unfortunately, they can't sing worth a shit. But, when you put one of their songs into the hands of someone who can sing, it's magic: See Jeff Buckley's cover of “Hallelujah.” My favorite cover of a Cohen song is “Tower of Song” by Martha Wainwright. It's only on the soundtrack to the movie “Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man.” You don't need to buy it. Here's a wonderful version they did for Letterman.
2.  They are one of the iconic writers of the Beat Generation. Curmudgeon and bona fide loon, William Burroughs covered R.E.M.'s “Star Me Kitten” for Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by “The X Files”. I'm not sure how it fits in with the X-Files except that Burroughs may have been a space alien. They certainly knew the truth was out there . . . somewhere. In any event, they take a rather maudlin, throw away R.E.M. song and turns it into a weird and creepy meditation on a dysfunctional relationship. Their old, graveled voice gives the song the extra weight it needed. It says, “Listen. I've seen some shit.”

IN Their first novel, “Player Piano” (1952), Kurt Vonnegut foresaw that industry might one day resemble a “stupendous Rube Goldberg machine” (or as Brits would say, a Heath Robinson contraption). Their story describes a dystopia in which machines have taken over brain work as well as manual work, and a giant computer, EPICAC XIV, makes all the decisions. A few managers and engineers are still employed to tend their new masters. But most people live in homesteads where they spend their time doing make-work jobs, watching television and “breeding like rabbits”.
It is impossible to read “Player Piano” today without wondering whether Vonnegut's stupendous machine is being assembled before our eyes. Google has designed self-driving cars. America's military-security complex has pioneered self-flying killing machines. Educational entrepreneurs are putting enlightenment online. Are we increasingly living in Vonnegut's dystopia? Or are the techno-enthusiasts right to argue that life is about to get a lot better?

Two things are clear. The first is that smart machines are evolving at breakneck speed. Moore's law—that the computing power available for a given price doubles about every 18 months—continues to apply. This power is leaping from desktops into people's pockets. More than 1.1 billion people own smartphones and tablets. Manufacturers are putting smart sensors into all sorts of products. The second is that intelligent machines have reached a new social frontier: knowledge workers are now in the eye of the storm, much as stocking-weavers were in the days of Ned Ludd, the original Luddite. Bank clerks and travel agents have already been consigned to the dustbin by the thousand; teachers, researchers and writers are next. The question is whether the creation will be worth the destruction.
Two academics at MIT's Sloan Business School, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, have taken a surprisingly Vonnegutish view on this: surprising because management theorists like to be on the side of the winners and because MIT is one of the great strongholds of techno-Utopianism. In “Race Against the Machine”, their 2011 book, they predict that many knowledge workers are in for a hard time. There is a good chance that technology may destroy more jobs than it creates. There is an even greater chance that it will continue to widen inequalities. Technology is creating ever more markets in which innovators, investors and consumers—not workers—get the lion's share of the gains. The Brynjolfsson-McAfee thesis explains one of the most puzzling aspects of the modern economy: why so much technological creativity can co-exist with stagnating wages and mass unemployment.
A new study by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), “Disruptive technologies: Advances that will transform life, business and the global economy”, shines a light on this problem and produces lots of examples of the way the internet is revolutionising knowledge work. Law firms are using computers to search through masses of legal briefs and precedents. Financial companies are using computers to monitor news feeds and make financial bets on the basis of the information they uncover. Hospitals are using robots to perform keyhole surgery.
The rate of progress, says MGI, is set to increase dramatically thanks to a combination of Moore's law and the melding of three technologies: machine learning, voice recognition and nanotechnology. Tiny computers will be able to perform jobs once regarded as the peculiar preserve of humans: most middle-class people will soon have access to electronic personal assistants (to book flights or co-ordinate diaries) and wearable physicians (to keep a permanent watch on their vital organs).
MGI puts a typically positive spin on all this. It argues that being spared relatively undemanding tasks will free knowledge workers to deal with more complex ones, making them more productive. It argues that the latest wave of innovation will be good for both entrepreneurs and consumers. Small businesses will be able to act like giant ones, because cloud computing will give them access to huge processing power and storage, and because the internet destroys distance. Innovators will be able to test their new ideas with prototypes, then produce them for niche markets. Consumers captured much of the economic gains created by “general-purpose technologies” like steam and electric power, because they stimulated competition as well as increasing efficiency. MGI reckons that so far they have captured two-thirds of the gains from the internet.
Techno-backlash
Nevertheless, MGI's study has some sympathy with Messrs Brynjolfsson and McAfee. It worries that modern technologies will widen inequality, increase social exclusion and provoke a backlash. It also speculates that public-sector institutions will be too clumsy to prepare people for this brave new world. Policymakers need to think as hard about managing the current wave of disruptive innovation as technologists are thinking about turbocharging it. For one thing, the purpose of education systems, and the skills and knowledge that they impart, will need to be rethought: “chalk and talk” instruction will be done best by machines, freeing teachers to become more like individual coaches to their pupils.
Knowledge-intensive industries will also have to rethink cherished practices. For a start, in an age in which information and processing power are ubiquitous, they will have to become less like guilds, whose reflexes are to regulate supply and restrict competition, and more like mass-market businesses, whose instinct is to maximise the customer base. Innovation will disrupt many areas of skilled work that have so far had it easy. But if we manage them well, smart machines will free us, not enslave us.

is available now! It mostly fixes some annoyances, for example the default window spawn positions have been improved to not be in the center of the screen anymore (i.e., the place you want to work on and most likelywant to have obstructed by windows...)Since the game remembers where you dragged the windows to you will only really notice this on a fresh installation. It has been annoying many new players though, so it's good to have that improved.We also overhauled the Build Challenge voting UI. The old UI always gave an advantage to entries that were submitted early. It showed the highest-rated entries first, so if you submitted a good entry very early it was likely to get to the top of the list and as a result receive even more votes and stay at the top, whereas entries that were submitted after a few days oftentimes got buried and received very few votes. This has gotten more extreme after the 1.0 launch since there are more players now.The new voting UI looks like this:It's entirely possible that this will need some further tweaks of course, but let's see how it goes :)All submissions can be found on the Workshop - thanks for everyone participating!These are the 5 winning entries:For February 2019 the new Build Challenge is to build a Stand-up Coaster!The "generic theme + 1 theme of your choosing limitation" from last month worked really well, so we're keeping it.The top submissions get included in the next game update as default blueprints.
A West Side alderman is taking another stab at cracking down on Chicago businesses that allow patrons to carry in their own booze, but their latest plan would not affect the hundreds of BYOB restaurants in the city.
Ald. Deborah Graham began trying to regulate bring-your-own-bottle businesses last fall when a proposed banquet hall in their 29th Ward wanted to allow BYOB in a dry precinct. City Council colleagues balked at Graham's first attempt, which would have ended BYOB in all businesses in the roughly 12 percent of Chicago precincts that are dry.
Several aldermen said last fall that businesses that lack liquor licenses rely on patrons being able to bring in their own alcohol to drive traffic into the establishments. Graham shelved the proposal and Mayor Rahm Emanuel said their administration would work on a compromise.
The revised version of the ordinance, which Graham introduced last week, would allow aldermen to outlaw BYOB privileges for businesses other than restaurants in specific parts of their wards. Each violation of a BYOB ban under Graham's plan would carry a fine of between $500 and $1,000 for the business owner, according to the proposal.
Graham's push to regulate BYOBs began just days after a Tribune story published in late September pointed out they helped lift a moratorium on new liquor licenses along a stretch of West Madison Street to clear the way for the opening of a liquor store backed by a convicted drug dealer.
The store also got special taxing district money even though such money is not supposed to go to liquor stores. Graham said the timing of the article and their push to regulate BYOBs was a coincidence.
But their move brought to the City Council's attention the fact that BYOBs are totally unregulated in Chicago. City Liquor Commissioner Gregory Steadman told aldermen last fall that nearly any type of business in Chicago that wants to could simply decide to allow patrons to carry in liquor.
Emanuel spokesperson Kelley Quinn said Monday that the administration takes a positive view of Graham's latest proposal.
“We support the alderman's efforts and have been working with them to accomplish their goals,” Quinn said in an email.
Graham said last fall that it might make sense for the city to license BYOBs and include a fee to help the city pay for administering them, but no such language is included in their latest ordinance. Graham did not return calls seeking comment.

Prime Minister John Key is struggling to see anything to smile about lately.
John Key Inc. is now a full- on joke but to watch this nation become an international laughing-stock is just not funny.
To save the government sme time I disclose here and now that I am a New Zealand citizen.
Therefore, if they desire retaliation, it's the plain old SIS spy treatment for me. During the interminable boredom that comes with non-stop surveillance they might get lucky and observe the occasional female on female smooch. Knock yourselves out, boys.
Events of late find me 100 per cent convinced that John Key's smug reign has finally breached any normal person's tolerance for absurdity. I use the word "normal" lightly because enough people, but not most, voted for these bumblers. Where the same pundits used to ooze poll-driven smarm, now ask them why they voted National in the last election. Note how they look decidedly shame-faced, with reddened cheeks and resolute eye-contact evasion. I get that. If I were them I'd be mortified at my obvious lack of intelligence too.
Let's take a look back at a few of this government's recent "greatest hits" or, as I like to call them, misses. Ginormous, innards-sucking, black hole-type misses.
1. The raid and arrest of Kim Dotcom is the latest, and probably greatest, politically damaging debacle thus far. It has caught John Key and Bill English squarely in its net and will roll heads. Just who's noggin will feel the chop is anyone's guess, but it won't be attached to Dotcom or to any politician. It will probably be some dispensable, faceless bureaucrat.
2. The donation from Dotcom to John Banks and the subsequent police report, wilfully unread by the prime minister, has certainly ended any notion of Banks being even remotely compos mentis - and if, by some stretch of the imagination, they actually are the full quid, then he's about as devious a politician as one can get. I think he's safer playing the alzheimic card for the moment. As long as they remember that's actually what he's doing then they should be Jake . . . or Jim or Joe or whoever.
3. Asset sales. Need I say more?
4. Just as the Arctic ice melts at an astoundingly rapid clip so does any semblance of honouring New Zealand's international commitments to reducing climate change. Publicly haranguing Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment Dr Jan Wright's independence and impartiality, after not liking the findings of their government-commissioned report into the Emissions Trading Scheme, was a very low blow. Them integrity was called in to question by select committee members when they pointed out that the numbers simply didn't stack up when the biggest polluters (agriculture) are, in effect, "subsidised" by the taxpayers for years to come. This helps the climate how?
5. The Government completely outdid itself in the dork stakes at the recent IUCN World Conservation Congress held in Korea. A motion was put forward aimed at stopping the extinction of the world's rarest dolphins and porpoises, including New Zealand's Hector's and Maui's dolphins. Five hundred and seventy-six members, including governments and NGOs, voted for the motion, and only two opposed. The New Zealand government was both of them. They claim the science just isn't there despite both these dolphins being the most studied in the world. So what did this little lark achieve exactly? Yep, it made this country look exactly like what this National government has let us become. The opposite of what we've always been - environmental vandals.
6. The bouquet for sheer Romney-esque imbecility goes to Phil Heatley for saying that anybody with concerns about oil expansion and fracking "are not really New Zealand. They have concerns but they are not really middle-class New Zealand".
They said this at the recent New Zealand Petroleum Summit, where their blatant suckage towards oil companies was on full nauseating display.
Heatley has continued to insist that fracking is totally safe and that the Taranaki Regional Council are flawless regulators.
Later that night, Heatley was brought down to earth somewhat when TV3 ran a story on the scale of contaminated soil at Shell Todd's Kapuni site and that it had been there for a decade.
Their fawning rhetoric suddenly solidified and to say they "fracked up" is an understatement.
So, that's just a random sampling of the brainless, embarrassing blunders and stumbles we are subjected to on a daily basis. Our nation's reputation is taking a hammering like never before and our citizens continue to leave in droves.
What can we do about it? Nothing until an election, but, in the meantime, how about holding some National voters accountable?
Remind them what they've done to the rest of us. Shame them out. Buy over-ripe tomatoes. Throw them. Sleep deeply and well.
Hopefully when you awake this money-driven, ideological and environmental nightmare might almost be over.

Mozzie magnetism is 'all in the genes'
Natural repellent The puzzle of why some people attract mosquitoes and others don't get bitten at all has nothing to do with diet and everything to do with genes, a new study has found.
A UK twin study has revealed that that certain people are genetically blessed with the ability to repel mosquitoes.
The study, published today in PLOS ONE , found that while identical twins were highly likely to show the same attractiveness to mosquitoes, non-identical twin pairs were not, suggesting a genetic basis for mosquito appeal.
In contrast, studies into whether garlic, vitamin B or beer repel mosquitoes have so far failed to find any effect of diet on mosquito attractiveness.
Co-author Dr James Logan, senior lecturer in entomology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health, says the genetic link is strong.
"We're looking at the level of heritability that might be associated with things like human height or IQ; these traits that we know … are hereditary, and that we can pass on," says Logan.
"When you speak to people anecdotally, people will quite often say that my son or daughter is the same as me, they always get bitten or they seem to never get bitten."
These anecdotal reports, as well as Logan's frustration at their own apparent attractiveness to mosquitoes, prompted researchers to look into the question of what was behind this phenomenon.
The study used Y-shaped tubes to offer female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes the choice of one of two hands belonging to either identical or non-identical twin pairs.
This revealed that there was little difference between identical twins in how likely the mosquito was to pick one or the other twin, but significant differences when it came to non-identical twins.
Logan says previous studies comparing mosquito-attractive and non-attractive individuals suggests that people who don't attract mosquitoes produce extra chemicals in their skin that make them repellent.
"It's almost like body has natural defence system against mosquitoes and it seems to be genetically controlled, so if you put the two bits of the puzzle together, it suggests that the genes are controlling natural repellents produced by the body," Logan says.
While researchers are yet to examine whether people from malaria-prone areas might be more likely to have these natural repellent genes, Logan says the finding could help explain why some people are less likely to contract malaria than others.
"What we do know is that in Africa sometimes you get populations where 80 per cent of the population are not as at risk of getting malaria," they say.
"You can become immune to malaria, so that probably plays a role, and also things like access to bed nets, but this could also be playing a role."
While the study was only a pilot project, it could pave the way for research into these mosquito-repellent genes and the chemicals that they produce, with a view to developing drugs that might boost these chemicals.
"Imagine taking a pill when you go on holiday or during mosquito season, and it causes your body to start producing more of these repellent chemicals which would mean you wouldn't have to put so much of the sticky repellent on your skin," Logan says.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Organization of the Islamic Conference on Friday added its voice to the growing criticism of a film released by a Dutch lawmaker, which features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Jeddah, Saudi Arabia-based OIC, released a statement condemning "in the strongest terms the release of the film 'Fitna' by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders."
The organization added that the film defamed and denigrated "the Holy Quran, causing insult to the sentiments of more than 1.3 billion Muslims in the world.
"The film was a deliberate act of discrimination against Muslims" that aimed to "provoke unrest and intolerance," the organization said.
The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations.
In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law.
The 15-minute film, posted Thursday on a London-based Web site, has also drawn condemnation from the European Union and others.
The European Union said the film inflames hatred, and Iran's Foreign Ministry called the movie "anti-Islamic and insulting."
The foreign ministry called on the EU, the Netherlands, and Britain to take action to put an end to its showing, the official IRNA news agency reported.
The Danish Union of Journalists said it was suing Wilders for using a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed drawn by one of its members, newspaper political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. It said Wilders used the picture -- which shows Mohammed with a turban shaped like a bomb -- without permission.
The film, titled "Fitna," opens with Westergaard's controversial caricature, followed by translated portions of Islam's holy book, the Quran.
The passages are interspersed with graphic images of the September 11 terrorist attacks juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York and other video clips.
The video includes disturbing images of other terror attacks; bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional full-body attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians.
The film concludes with scrolling messages reading in part: "The government insists that you respect Islam, but Islam has no respect for you" and "In 1945, Nazism was defeated in Europe. In 1989, communism was defeated in Europe. Now the Islamic ideology has to be defeated."
Wilders, the filmmaker, is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom. They have been outspoken in their criticism of Islam and called the religion a threat to the world.
"It's not a provocation, but the harsh reality and a political conclusion," Wilders said of the film Thursday.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mohammad-Ali Hosseini on Friday condemned Wilders and the UK-based Web site hosting the film, LiveLeak.com, for showing the "provocative and anti-Islamic movie."
"He said such a 'dirty act' of the Dutch lawmaker and of a British institute at the end of the Islamic Unity Week reveals continued enmity and deep hostility of such western nationals against Islam and Muslims," IRNA reported.
"Warning against consequences of such 'provocative' acts, Hosseini asked the Dutch and British governments as well as (the) European Union to step in the case as soon as possible and prevent and put an end to showing of such (an) 'insulting, anti-Islamic and anti-cultural' film," IRNA wrote.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the film, calling it "offensively anti-Islamic" while urging calm.
"There is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence," they said in a statement. "The right of free expression is not at stake here."
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Thursday that the film equates Islam with violence.
"We reject this interpretation," Balkenende said in a statement. "The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence. In fact, the victims are often also Muslims."
Slovenia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said Friday that it supports the Dutch government's position and believes the film does nothing to promote dialogue among religions.
"Mutual tolerance and respect are universal values we should uphold. We believe that acts, such as the above-mentioned film, serve no other purpose than inflaming hatred."
The U.S. government warned the film could spark protests and riots.
The title of the film, "Fitna," translates in Arabic to "strife" or "conflict" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group.
LiveLeak issued a statement Thursday saying there was no legal reason not to allow Wilders to post the film. It said the site's policy is to remain unbiased and allow freedom of speech.
Some in the Muslim community rejected the film as nothing more than dangerous anti-Islamic propaganda.
"This film is a direct attempt to incite violence from Muslims and help fan the flames of Islamophobia," Arsalan Iftikhar, a contributor to Washington-based Islamica Magazine, told CNN on Thursday. "Any reasonable person can see this is meant to spit in the face of Muslims and insult our religion."
Iftikhar said they doubted the film would spark the same type of violence that followed the publication of the caricature of Mohammed, but they called on Muslim leaders to react peacefully.
Westergaard's caricature was one of a dozen printed in a Danish newspaper in late 2005. Violent protests erupted early the next year after other European newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech.
Some Muslims believe the Quran forbids showing an image of the prophet. E-mail to a friend

CLOSE Vendors have been surprised at how many customers are coming through the Downtown Detroit Markets. The pop-up marketplace was extended and now runs through Jan. 28. Wochit

Downtown Detroit's pop-up shops have been swarmed with customers this holiday season and ringing up phenomenal sales, a boon for the city and a win for real-life shopping when online shopping is making all the news.
Vendors in the Detroit Downtown Markets, a marketplace of 30 temporary shops near Campus Martius and Capitol Park, reported doing such strong business in late November and early December that the markets' operations were extended by three weeks. This includes the small village of shops inside glass huts.
Downtown Markets will now run through Jan. 28, said Francesca George, director of tenant relations for the Bedrock real estate firm. Bedrock organizes the pop-ups marketplace and, along with other Dan Gilbert-companies in the Quicken Loans family, is behind the "Winter in Detroit" marketing campaign.

The extension will let vendors remain open for the downtown crowds during the 2018 North American International Auto Show and the popular Winter Blast on the final weekend in January. The marketplace opened Nov. 17 and is substantially bigger than last year.

"The vendors didn't want us to close, and that's why we extended it," George said. "Every single vendor has been doing really, really well. If anything, the biggest issue we have is vendors are running out of inventory."
The pop-up shops are small locally-owned businesses that generally do not have year-round storefronts. Detroit Downtown Markets puts these shops in front of downtown's many weekday office workers and weekend visitors. For their part, the shops provide another reason for people to make a trip downtown.
This year's setup includes a large, temporary indoor lounge in Cadillac Square, the Cadillac Lounge, where food and $9 craft cocktails are served.

In interviews this week, numerous pop-up shop vendors said their sales and customer foot traffic this season surpassed expectations.
"This is busier than I ever anticipated. There's a line out my door every single day," said Ashley Gold, owner of Ashley Gold jewelry, who ordinarily sells their merchandise — all of which they design — through the Internet or at boutique shows.
"Being down here gives me much better exposure, because everybody comes here — not just Detroiters," Gold said. "I started with 2,000 business cards on Nov. 17 and I just ordered new ones over the weekend, so that tells you something."
Owners of The End Grain Woodworking Co., which sells furniture and objects for the homemade from the reclaimed wood of old Detroit buildings, were unsure whether joining the pop-ups would be worthwhile.
But co-owner Sam Constantine said they are now very glad they decided to rent space in one of the marketplace's glass huts.
"We've had some phenomenal days. The last Saturday and Sunday — I can't believe how much stuff we've sold," they said, adding. "The first few weeks that we did it, we surpassed the amount of sales that we did the entire season last year."
Many of the pop-up shoppers buying clothing are looking for unique items that one can't find from big retailers, according to Tee Capel, owner of Fly Behavior Style Lounge, a women's boutique set up in 1001 Woodward that doesn't have a year-round storefront.
"A lot of people are coming down looking for special Detroit-based brands and products and gifts," Capel said. "Prior to this, a lot of my business was online. But being here and being visible, it's been great. The business here has kind of outweighed the online business."
The pop-up shops have been helping suburbanites get back into the habit of shopping in Detroit.
Vanessa Priebe, 31, of Clarkston made their first-ever shopping trip downtown this week with a friend to buy stocking stuffers. One of their purchases was a Vernors-inspired, ginger-scented candle.
"I feel like my friends from out of state are going to love this," they said. "It will be like a nice piece of home for them. It's unique to Detroit, and that's what makes it amazing."
Another pop-up shopper, Jenna DeVries, 24, who lives in Detroit's West Village, walked through the marketplace with a shopping bag carrying the mixed nuts and chocolate bar they bought inside 1001 Woodward, where about 10 pop-up vendors are set up.
"I'd rather support the local vendors than go to the mall," they said.

Some longtime Detroiters were surprised to see how one pop-up vendor, Greystone Gardens, is selling natural Christmas trees, presumably for the city's growing population of downtown apartment-dwellers, even though some high-rises don't allow real trees for fire safety reasons.
Lloyd Michael, whose wife, Debra, owns the Armada Township-based business, said Bedrock contacted them to see whether they had any interest in Detroit this Christmas season. Sales have been going "all right," they said.
"For the first year, it's about what I expected. We sell some trees every single day. We haven't had a day when we didn't sell any," Michael said.
Overall, they noticed little difference between the sizes of Christmas trees people buy in downtown compared to in the suburbs. Many people assumed they would mostly sell very small trees to fit into apartments, they said.
Some of their first customers bought the tallest, biggest $140 trees on the lot for their downtown penthouse. Most of the trees are priced between $40 and $60.
"Our most popular trees have probably been 6 to 8 feet," they said. "So there's really no difference here, I believe, than in the suburbs."

That “worst health” label includes a ranking of 34th in the world with infant mortality. In other words, the USA has the 34th worst infant survival with its highest rate of vaccinations. Some are directly from multiple vaccinations administered.
But the USA leads the world in infant vaccinations, those administered during the first year after their births – 26 vaccinations during that time.
The only vaccination I recall receiving during early childhood, circa 1948, was the smallpox vaccine, the one that left a circle of shallow pockmarks on the upper arm, a non-ink tattoo that proved you had received that vaccine. Months later there was the booster shot which gave me a vacation of several days away from my first grade teacher while sitting out the chicken pox.
During Naval training the mass vaccination high pressure hand held gun that replaced syringes and needles was tried on us with the polio shot. I wound up with a vacation in the base infirmary with an extended period of the flu. Between those two, there may have been a tetanus shot or two.
From the Healthy Home Economist:
-In1950, there were 3 childhood vaccines typically given when a child entered school.
-In 1983, there were 10 recommended vaccines by the age of 6 years old (24 doses, 7 injections, 4 oral doses for polio).
-In 2010, the CDC vax schedule totaled 68 doses with more than half given by the time a child was only a year and a half old.
-In 2016, the schedule has increased to 74 doses by age 17 with 53 injections and 3 oral doses of rotavirus.
The number of vaccines included in the current childhood vaccine schedule has quadrupled over the past 60 years, with several demanding multiple injections and boosters. During this exponential rise of CDC “recommended” schedules, the health of American children has plummeted.
Autoimmune diseases, learning disabilities, food allergies, chronic ailments, and childhood obesity have all risen. The overall health of this nation ranks very low compared to all other industrialized nations, dead last in most areas.
Vaccine false dogma is so heavy hardly anyone with authority, even in mainstream media, makes the connection between poor health with high vaccination rates. Instead, more, three added for 2016, are getting enforced by mandate or coerced by pediatricians who have the right to refuse medical care on kids who aren't vaccinated.
Destroying Health with Vaccines is Good Business
In 1986, after the swine flu shot debacle of 1976, pharmaceutical companies lobbied and helped write the legislation that guaranteed they couldn't get sued for vaccine adverse effects, damages, and deaths.
That legislation created the vaccine court where vaccine damages would be compensated to parents of vaccine injured children if they could prove the injuries were vaccine caused. It's a cumbersome system set-up outside of the tort court system, without juries of peers, to determine who gets settlements supplied by surcharge taxes on vaccines sold.
So we have large sociopathic pharmaceutical companies making big bucks from worthless protections against minor diseases, which often create collateral damage that's considered worth the greater good of herd immunity. All nonsense. But it's a great business profit oriented model.
The trail of worsened health among children lines up even more business for pharmaceutical companies and the academic sociopaths that that benefit from “checkbook research”, that is getting the results Big Pharma wants for getting their toxic “solutions” to market.

They said they just wanted a ride to their boyfriend's home — before the man who picked them up pulled a gun and raped them The man's attorneys argued the sex was consensual.
The woman's tearful testimony Wednesday highlighted the first day of trial for Larry Griffin in Ramsey County District Court.  They are accused of sexually assaulting four people in St. Paul last fall, three of them with a gun. Wednesday's was the first of several trials the 39-year-old St. Paul man faces.
The 31-year-old Lino Lakes woman took the stand Wednesday and described what happened after they say Griffin pulled their gun on Aug. 30.
“He told me if I screamed, they were going to shoot me,” the woman testified. They ordered them into the back seat of their van and then raped her, they said. The Pioneer Press does not generally name people who say they are victims of sexual assault.
Griffin is on trial for just one of the cases, charged with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for the Aug. 30 allegation. They have pleaded not guilty. Charges have been filed in the other cases and will likely be tried later.
DEFENSE ARGUES CONSENT
Griffin's attorney, John Riemer, argued in their opening statement that the sex that morning was consensual.
“Mr. Griffin is not the rapist that they're putting up here. Mr. Griffin is a human being. …  They are not a rapist,” Riemer said. They further argued that jurors should judge testimony on “the three R's”: That it be reasonable, reliable and rational. And then they added a fourth.
“There is one more ‘R': regret. Regret for a poor choice.”
Ramsey County assistant prosecutor Jill Gerber acknowledged that Griffin's accuser made some bad choices that night, but added, “Remember, this defendant used a gun to get what they wanted. It wasn't consensual.”
The other cases against Griffin do not involve a consent defense, and largely rely on DNA evidence, Riemer said.
Time ran out before Reimer could cross-examine their client's accuser Wednesday; that cross-examination will likely take place Thursday.
WOMAN RECOUNTS NIGHT
The woman testified that they had left their boyfriend's house on St. Paul's East Side after a fight, and was walking along Payne Avenue with some bags and their Chihuahua when Griffin drove up to them in their van.
After talking to him, they agreed to let them give them a lift to a friend's house nearby.
“He seemed like they wanted to keep talking to me, and I just didn't want to stand there any longer,” they replied when Ramsey County assistant prosecutor Sarah Cory asked why they accepted the ride. “I had a lot of things on me, too, that I didn't want to keep carrying.” Related Articles Minneapolis woman whose husband beat, sexually abused daughters sentenced for neglect

Griffin dropped them off at the friend's house, but not before repeatedly saying they wanted to “hang out,” the woman testified. They replied that they could come to their friend's house, but they said they didn't want to because the friend had friends they were worried might “rob him.”
Early that morning, the woman asked Griffin if they could take them back to their boyfriend's house so they could get the rest of them things. They communicated by text through their friend's phone.
After Griffin picked them up, they pulled into an alley and pulled a gun, and began ranting about other friends of his, “and then suddenly, they said they were gonna use (the gun) on me,” the woman said. “I asked if they were kidding and they said no.”
The woman said Griffin ordered them to the back seat of their van, where they raped them
“I had … a lot of thoughts about what to do, should I jump out of the car and run? But so many things could happen. … I didn't want to die,” they said, tearing up.
At one point, they said they put the gun down on the seat, and they considered grabbing it but couldn't bring themselves to do it. They said they then handed them their clothes, apologized and dropped them off at their friend's home.
At the urging of a relative, the woman went to Regions Hospital later that morning for a sexual assault exam.
POLICE RECOVERED A GUN
Several police officers also testified Wednesday, saying a gun was recovered from Griffin's van when they were arrested.
The gun turned out to be a pellet gun but looks similar to any other gun, testified officer Mark Lundquist, who works for the St. Paul Police Department's forensic unit.
Two more replica guns were found in Griffin's garage, police said.
Titanic Belfast named world's best tourist attraction at Tourism Oscars BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Titanic Belfast has been crowned the best tourist attraction in the world. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/titanic-belfast-named-worlds-best-tourist-attraction-at-tourism-oscars-35263608.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article35263607.ece/1aca1/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-beffcaab-eabd-4ad4-9e34-5853efa6328b_I1.jpg

Titanic Belfast has been crowned the best tourist attraction in the world.
The museum, which opened in 2012, staved off competition from Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, the Las Vegas Strip and Peru's Machu Picchu to clinch the accolade at a ceremony for the World Travel Awards in the Maldives.
It is the first time any attraction from Ireland, north or south, has won in the 23-year history of the awards, dubbed the Tourism Oscars.
Tim Husbands, Titanic Belfast's chief executive, said they were delighted.
"The Titanic story captures hearts and minds throughout the world and at Titanic Belfast this is no exception.
"Our interpretation of the story and ability to engage with visitors on many different levels has been fundamental in winning this award.
"With the award, we hope to attract more tourists to Northern Ireland to discover it.
"A huge thank you to our staff and all our supporters that voted, locally and across the world, to help us reach this iconic goal of being the world's leading tourist attraction."
The new title puts the Belfast landmark on a par with previous winners such as the Taj Mahal in India and the Egyptian pyramids.
More than one million votes were cast from over 216 countries and the Titanic Belfast campaign was supported by well-known Northern Irish personalities, politicians and sports stars.
The Guinness Storehouse in Dublin was also in the running.
Earlier this year, the multimillion-pound visitors' centre, which has been visited by the Queen and US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, beat the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Rome's Colosseum, the Acropolis of Athens and La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona to scoop the best in Europe accolade.
Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster offered them congratulations.
They said: "In just four short years, Titanic Belfast has become an iconic tourist must-see, attracting over three million visitors from all over the world.
"We always knew that in Titanic Belfast, we were home to a world class attraction that would become a global brand.
"While it's no surprise to me it has been recognised in this way, it is a wonderful achievement to win the world's best accolade ahead of other venues like Machu Picchu and Abu Dhabi's Ferrari World."
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said: "This is terrific news for Titanic Belfast and will help in our global pitch to make the north of Ireland one of the world's top tourism destinations.
"The Titanic story is well known but it is greatly enhanced and enriched by the visitor experience at Titanic Belfast."
More than three million people from around the world have already visited Titanic Belfast since opening in 2012.
This year, more than 84% of the visitors came from outside Northern Ireland and the attraction has been described by travel writers as "an inspiring testament to the Titanic and the city that built it".
Trump released a tape on Friday night apologizing after a video from 2005 obtained by the Washington Post contains audio of Donald Trump making highly sexual comments degrading women.
This latest leaked video is drawing immediate and harsh rebukes from both sides of the aisle and their apology isn't doing any better.
People have been weighing in on their apology video on social media.
"After years of repeatedly insulting women, that 'apology' rings empty," one person tweeted.
Donald Trump's comments about women deserve widespread condemnation... and saying "if anyone is offended" is not a real apology. — Ed Stetzer (@edstetzer) October 7, 2016
Another user tweeted out that Trump's video was a non-apology.
Here's the video statement, in case you missed it.
I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. Donald Trump
But wait. Did you catch what Donald Trump said in the first sentence?
@Helena_Torry I consider myself too perfect and have no faults. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2014
Well, here's Donald Trump quite literally saying he's a perfect person.

And, according to a Washington Post article from May, Donald Trump used to pose as their own spokesperson.
WATCH| An SNL skit mocking Trump for posing as their own president.
"It doesn't sound like my voice at all," Trump told NBC's Today show.
"I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that and this sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. Doesn't sound like me."
Trump remained that they did not pose as their publicist.

As 2017 kicks off, we've put together a list of 101 economics and finance blogs that you might want to add to your RSS feeds and browser's bookmarks this year, if you haven't already. The list was compiled by the FocusEconomics Insights Blog with the help of the FocusEconomics team of economists. The criteria for inclusion in the list was simply that they had to have regularly blogged in 2016 and that they needed to be English-language blogs. In the future we hope to be able to compile a list of foreign-language blogs.
In this list, there are economics blogs from the Keynsian school to the Chicago school to the Austrian school and everything in between. We've included blogs on microeconomics, macroeconomics, health economics, sports economics and even water economics. Politics and public policy are common themes in many of these blogs as the impact of politics and policy plays an important role in economics of all kinds. Let's also not forget the intersection between economics and finance. There are some purely finance and investment related blogs in this list as well as blogs that do a bit of it all.
As you read through this list, you may be asking where all of the big established media blogs are. Where is Krugman, the Economist blogs and the WSJ's Real Time Economics? Although, we do recommend you read some of those blogs, with this list we tried to put together an eclectic mix of blogs from individuals and institutions that you may not have heard of. We believe this list should provide a wealth of choices, presenting perspectives from different ends of the economics and finance blogosphere. It is important not to get stuck in an echo chamber, listening and reading the same things over and over again without understanding other perspectives. Therefore, some of the blogs on this list are contrarian in nature and even in some cases highly controversial. We don't necessarily endorse all of the bloggers's viewpoints, however we do acknowledge that there are two sides (or more) to every coin.
With that said, we can dive into FocusEconomics' Top Economics and Finance Blogs of 2017 listed in no particular order (actually they are listed in alphabetical order, but just because it seemed easier). Be sure to scroll down and have a look at all of the blogs. If you're short on time, each blog has a bolded section with the "Focus topics" listed underneath the write-up that should help to identify what each blog is generally about quickly and easily.
There's a pretty bold, legal line between treating yourself and stealing over $25,000 from your employer, one former Uber contractor found Monday with a six-month jail sentence.
Bernie Ali Martinez will also complete five years of probation for the joy ride they took in the form of credits for themselves and their friends and family, Bay City News reports.
Martinez had access to Uber's computer system, which they used between February and May 2016 to grant credits for rides and UberEATS deliveries often to their Colma home. They pleaded no contest to felony grand theft charges in June, almost one year after investigators seized their computer and phone.
Uber released a statement to CNET in June clarifying that Martinez was not a driver or employee, but a temporary contractor.
“As part of their job responsibilities, they were authorized to issue credits, but once we detected the abuse, we shut down their access and reported the theft to law enforcement,” Uber told CNET.
Prosecutors said the 25-year-old Martinez will pay a large chunk of the value they took from Uber, more than $18,000, in restitution, court fees and various fines.

DISCLAIMER: This project is not endorsed by Nintendo, Nintendo of America, or the Nintendo World Store. It is an unofficial and unauthorized project to be organized and attended by fans.
The one-day charter bus tour will begin from a pickup location in Washington D.C. on the morning of Saturday, March 21, 2015. Each person will be provided with a custom lanyard displaying his/her name and favorite games featuring StreetPass content, along with snack packs for the ride.
On the way to and from the Nintendo World Store at Rockefeller Center in New York City there will be special competitions including game tournaments and costume contests, and planned stops on the way north to interact with Nintendo Zones or interested groups that want to meet-up to StreetPass along the I-95 corridor.
The stop at the Nintendo World Store will last a few hours, allowing riders ample time to explore the store and grab dinner before boarding the buses back to Washington D.C.
Did we say there will be StreetPassing? Just to be clear all along the way there will be games and StreetPassing. StreetPassing all day, every (read: this one) day.
And, yes, the buses will have bathrooms.
The event will be covered by a videography crew, capturing interviews and footage of the tour throughout the day to be used in the production of a short documentary. All riders will be required to sign a media release prior to boarding the tour buses.
This documentary will be available to all via the web in summer 2015.
All bus riders must be 18 years of age or older. All participants will also be required to sign a waiver before boarding and riding the bus covering trip basics (meaning you are responsible for yourself if you decide to defect to NYC and not get back on the bus or if you are injured, etc).
This waiver will also serve as a media release as cameras will be rolling throughout the day to document the tour. Riders may bring their own food and drinks for the ride - a packed lunch is recommended to supplement provided snacks. No alcohol will be permitted on the bus.
A survey will be sent to all backers receiving bus tickets following the close of the campaign to collect information for shirt sizes, personalized lanyards and to confirm the names of ticket holders for the event.
All tour shirts are being produced by Haberdash in Richmond, Virginia.
Shirt shipping is free for all U.S. backers. International backers have the option to purchase a shirt by adding shipping costs to their total at checkout. Shirts for backers going on the tour will be delivered in person on March 21.
The majority of raised funds will be used to pay for the rental of the charter buses. In addition, monies raised will be used for snack packs for riders, prizes for contests, lanyards with custom IDs, videography expenses, and Kickstarter/Amazon fees. Any funds raised beyond the needed trip expenses will be put toward the documentary short to be produced alongside the event.

BOSTON — Money is on everyone's mind these days in Washington.
Congress is embarking on a high-octane debate over the government's profligate habits. It promises to be a legislative brawl that could make the ObamaCare negotiations seem civilized.
The stakes are high, as President Barack Obama noted in their recent speech. This week, Standard and Poor's threatened to downgrade the government's credit rating if the U.S. doesn't get its budget in order. If that happened, the U.S. would quickly face even higher interest payments on our debt, and American power would be severely eroded. Meanwhile, a deeply divided Congress must agree to raise the country's debt ceiling by May 16. Not doing so would cause us to default on our loans, shattering one of America's chief economic assets: reliability.
Washington's fiscal health is by no means a matter for the bean counters. America's chief military officer, Adm. Mike Mullen, has famously said that the single biggest threat to U.S. national security is not Al Qaeda, China, Iran or North Korea. It's the national debt.
To put the debate in perspective, we dove into the numbers to get a better sense of how big the problem is, and how difficult it will be to solve. Here's what you need to know. (Unless otherwise noted, we've used numbers from Obama's 2012 budget request, which is under consideration by Congress.)
Is the U.S. really as broke as everyone says it is? Is Mullen right that this is a security threat?
Well, yes. Without a doubt.
This year, the government will take in about $2.2 trillion and spend $3.8 trillion. For every dollar it collects, it spends $1.70.
Things are looking up somewhat, at least in theory. In 2012, according to the budget Obama submitted to Congress, the U.S. will spend about $80 billion less ($3.7 trillion). And as the economy recovers, the Treasury will take in $425 billion more ($2.6 trillion). At least, that's what the administration expects. Obama's budget risks getting larded with pork as it works its way through Congress. If Obama's budget were to be signed into law, the U.S. would spend $1.42 for every dollar it collects. That's better than 2011, but no one would call it good.
You hardly need to crunch numbers to conclude that this is unsustainable. The U.S. currently owes more than $14 trillion dollars. In 2011 we will pay $205 billion in interest — about $1,600 per household. According to Obama's budget, by 2020, interest payments will jump by more than 400 percent, to $863 billion.
So here's the national security question: Will the Chinese — who disagree or compete with the U.S. over ideology, territorial issues, resources and a multitude of other issues — lend us that money? And what will they demand in return?
How much money comes from taxpayers versus corporations?
Here's a good reason to pay attention: The money largely comes out of your paycheck. In 2012, American workers will send a hefty $2.07 trillion to Washington, compared to $327 billion from corporations. (For 2011, the corporate contribution will only be about $198 billion.)
So individuals pay six times more tax than corporations.
While it's tempting to raise more from corporations, some experts argue that this is the wrong approach, especially given the need to create more jobs. “The corporate income tax is more harmful to long-run economic growth than other taxes, which is why governments around the world, including left-wing governments, are reducing [them],” said Alan Viard, a scholar at the Republican-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
Can't we just fix the deficit by slashing wasteful spending and cutting back on all those government departments in Washington?
Unfortunately, that won't solve the problem, not even if we shut down every non-security, federal program.
Entirely eliminating these outlays — including money for highways, education, justice, science, cancer research, diplomacy, the environment and other government programs — would cut many jobs, harm the economy and dramatically impact our quality of life. And it would only reduce spending by about 12 percent. Put another way, instead of spending $1.42 per dollar it collects, the U.S. would be spending about $1.25, and we'd soon have the infrastructure and institutions resembling Somalia's.
If government bureaucrats aren't wasting it, where does all of our tax money go?
Mainly two places: social entitlements and national security.
Entitlement programs burn nearly 60 percent of the total budget — $2.1 trillion out of $3.7 trillion. Most of that goes to retired people. The government pension program (Social Security) costs $761 billion, and health care for the elderly costs $468 billion. A smaller allotment ($269 billion) supports health care for the poor, known as Medicaid. And a final $598 billion funds "other mandatory programs" established by Congress, including unemployment, Food Stamps, and retirement benefits for soldiers and federal civil servants.
These entitlements pose a challenge for lawmakers: cutting them would harm the most vulnerable, and would impact many voters, making this both practically and politically unpalatable.
The rest of the spending goes to national security. By sheer force of firepower, America is the strongest nation in history, able to wipe out entire countries at the press of a button. But that force comes at a steep cost.
America's sprawling national security apparatus is poised to cost $881 billion in 2012, up from $815 billion in 2010. To put this in perspective, if the U.S. security budget were a country, it would be the world's 19th biggest economy, behind Australia (population 22 million) but ahead of Iran (73 million), the world's fourth biggest oil producer. Only two states, New York and California, have economies bigger than the security budget.
Incidentally, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's hotly debated federal subsidy ($445 million) is equal to about four hours of security spending (disclosure: GlobalPost syndicates journalism to the PBS NewsHour, which is supported by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting).
How does the U.S. manage to spend so much on security?
The Defense Department budget accounts for the biggest portion of this: $553 billion. That's roughly equivalent to what America's biggest company (Wal-Mart) and biggest bank (Bank of America) collected in gross revenues in 2010. If it were a country, the Pentagon budget would be the world's 26th biggest economy, ahead of South Africa.
In fact, that $553 billion is only part of what the Pentagon spends. America's two major wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, are funded by a line item called the “Overseas Contingency Operations,” which adds $118 billion to Pentagon coffers for 2012. Ironically, that's roughly the size of Iraq's entire economy ($118 billion in 2010). It dwarfs Afghanistan's ($30 billion).
The good news for taxpayers is that spending on Iraq and Afghanistan is down from a peak of $195 billion in 2008. Of course, battlefield realities and politics will determine whether Congress will add even more money before the year ends.
Including the wars, the Pentagon spends $671 billion. That's more twice the 2001 figure of about $300 billion.
So if the Defense Department spends $671 billion, where does the other $210 billion in security spending go?
Other major security programs are still pricey, but they are somewhat more opaque. According to Chris Hellman, military policy fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, the budget includes the Department of Homeland Security ($53.5 billion), the Energy Department's nuclear weapons program ($19.3 billion), the State Department's contribution to the war on terror ($8.7 billion), and $129.3 billion for veterans programs (including disability, education and medical fees).
Additionally, the intelligence budget is classified, but the 2010 allocation is known to be at least $80 billion, according to Hellman.
How does the Pentagon manage to spend so much money?
The short answer is that it's a big military. Pentagon operations sprawl across the planet. Excluding Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. operates about 760 bases in 39 countries, according to research by Mother Jones. Collectively, these occupy a land area slightly bigger than North Korea. The military employs about 1.5 million soldiers, with a similar number on reserve.
The largest portion of the Pentagon's budget goes to operations and maintenance ($172 billion), “to support training and readiness.” Weapons systems ($113 billion) come next, with the radar-evading Joint Strike Fighter ($9.7 billion) taking the largest chunk. The Pentagon's research and development program ($76.7 billion) consumes the third largest sum, spending roughly the amount the government provided in food stamps for about 40 million people at the height of the financial crisis.
The Pentagon budget also includes a fortune for social programs benefiting soldiers. The Military Health System ($52.5 billion) constructs hospitals and clinics, and sets aside money for retired soldiers' Medicare. An additional $8.3 billion “supports military families,” including $4.7 billion “to improve service members quality of life,” $2.4 billion for schools and education, and $1.2 billion for child care.
So the U.S. spends 40 to 70 percent more than we earn in revenues. What can be done about this?
That's the multi-trillion dollar question, and the one that politicians will be debating in the coming weeks, months and perhaps years. Clearly, as Obama has suggested, no part of the budget can be considered sacrosanct. Slashing the Pentagon's spending back to 2001 levels and eliminating all non-entitlement government spending (highways, justice, education and the like) would not close the deficit — especially as baby boomers retire, pushing the annual entitlement bill up by 50 percent in the coming decade.
In a nutshell, the U.S. confronts few appealing options: we can plunge the elderly into poverty; dramatically scale back our security and quality of life; or increase taxes. A compromise would spread the pain among all of these options.
Or we can do none of the above, and consider learning to speak Mandarin.

Facebook on Monday denied a news report accusing the company of reading text messages on Android devices, but said it is running a "limited" test of new features that may require the company to make use of permissions it already asks from users to access their texts.
The Sunday Times in London published a report saying that Facebook and other companies including Yahoo and Google have access to a wide range of personal data on mobile devices, with some spying on text messages.
Facebook said its application for Android operating systems does not read or write text messages for most users. However, the company is "currently running a limited test of mobile features which integrate with SMS functionality," according to a statement.
Users should already be aware that Facebook has advised it may access their text messages. The company lists detailed information under the "Permissions" tab in the Android Market about what its application is authorized to do if users download it.
The Android mobile application for Facebook is authorized to receive, process and write text messages as well as read those communications, it reads.
The company said it declared to users that its Android application is capable of reading and writing text message starting with the 1.7 version of the application.
"If Facebook ultimately launches any feature that makes use of these permissions, we will ensure that this is accompanied by appropriate guidance/educational materials," the company said.
Yahoo and Google officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

Physicists have created the heaviest isotope yet of magnesium, but in their experiments an unexpected isotope of aluminum also showed up. The findings could help astrophysicists understand occasional X-ray emissions from neutron stars that are growing in mass.
The 7-day-long experiment took place at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), an atom smasher at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Hoping to test the limits of how many extra neutrons will bind to an atomic nucleus, researchers were trying to create magnesium-40, a heavyweight element with 18 more neutrons than the most common isotope, magnesium-22. Standard theory says that magnesium-40 should be the heaviest isotope of the element that can exist, if only for a fleeting instant, before decaying.
NSCL's Thomas Baumann and their colleagues shot nuclei of calcium-48—the heaviest naturally occurring calcium isotope—at a tungsten foil at about half the speed of light. Atomic coll

Product reviews
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Adrian from Norway on 17-09-2018 Jelly babies are quite unlike any other sweet I know and when my girlfriend tried them during a visit to England they thought they were fantastic. Good as they are with the slightly 'harder' coating' around a lovely soft jelly, it's probably not a good idea to eat too many at once. They can be a bit too much!
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Christina from the United States on 30-03-2018 Jelly Babies are a great hit with my friends here in the US. They had the misfortune of not growing up with them, so they are an exciting new discovery! I always have some requests for them when I'm putting in an order at the British Corner shop. For me, they are a reminder of my childhood. And Bassetts is the best!
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Christina from the United States on 13-12-2017 I love jelly babies! They are hands down one of my very favorite, if not most favorite, candies. I was surprised at the texture at first, living in the US I was expecting them to be more like gummy bears. They are softer than gummy bears on the inside, and they have a slightly crunchy sugar coating on the outside. When you chew them they have a gritty sugar texture too. I love them!
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By James from the United States on 20-08-2017 A childhood favourite that still lives up to expectations! The wifey and I almost ate the whole bag in one sitting. There are so many different coloured jellies in the bag, each representing the multitude of juicy flavours lime, orange, strawberry, blackcurrant, lemon raspberry. They are soft, chunky and delicious. Make sure to order multiple bags because one is never enough!
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Jaime from the United States on 24-03-2017 It is so good to be able to get the real thing in the States again... Bassett's are one of my favourite nonchocolate sweets. The flavours are distinct, and fresh, and the texture is unique the slightly harder exterior shell surrounding the softer jelly interior and the cornstarch coating to keep them from getting sticky in the bag. When you try to explain them to people here they always compare them to those dreadful gummy things... and they're not like that at all. They're slightly chewy, but soft while 'gummies' are like trying to chew tyre rubber. Another thing I particularly like the colours are somewhat muted compared to many in the confectionary world, but that's because they don't use artificial dyes or sweeteners a big plus in my view. I can still remember the first time I had a Jelly Baby it was given me by a tall bloke I'd never met before. I knew I wasn't supposed to talk to strangers, but they were nice all teeth and curls, and they had a floppy hat and this absurdly long scarf. Never saw them again, but I've been hooked on JellyBabies ever since.
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Sarah from Japan on 03-06-2015 Seriously delicious sweeties. Each baby has a different colour which has a different flavour, and each baby has its own shape, too. They have a very unique texture, a soft, chewy and ever so slightly sticky. The outer one or two millimetres are slightly hardened, and provide a very satisfying bite to the Babies. They're coated in corn starch so they don't stick; the only downside is occasionally wiping a floury hand on black trousers. Loved them for years and will continue to do so. Highly recommend Jelly Babies to anyone with a sweet tooth. Now the only question is - do you eat the head or the body first?
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Eileen from Canada on 03-05-2015 Jelly Babies are lovely little sweets that do taste like fruit juice, the white coating prevents them from becoming sticky and both the young and the young at heart can enjoy them. It is my personal philosophy that Jelly Babies are rather like people, different on the outside but are all basically the same on the inside, regardless of colour.
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Bruna from Italy on 29-10-2014 I've always wondered who had the idea of making little jelly babies for people to eat! Strange thing to do if you think about it... anyway, Bassetts Jelly Babies are chewy, fruity and delicious. The best part about them is the very thin outer shell, slightly different in texture than the jelly within. Kids love them but so do most adults so a big bag is a good idea!
A rating of 4 out of 5 Stars By Ian from Germany on 22-02-2014 Jelly Babies are nice, chunky sweets that are very tasty and fun to eat. When I was younger I had a particular way of eating them, as most people did. The fruity taste is something that can get sickly if you eat them in great quantities but as long as you do not eat a full bag in one sitting I am sure you will be fine!
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By colin from the United States on 26-10-2013 It is going to be tough not to give 5 stars to most of the products sold by BCS. Bassetts Jelly Babies are an easy 5 stars. Exactly the same taste as I remember 40 years ago, different from any other candy sold in the US, Other reviews cover the details, these sweets never get sticky in the bag, consistent quality, very easy to eat more than you planned so buy more than you think you need.
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Caterina from France on 16-10-2013 What a great deal! Only £1.99 for a bag full of fun. My kids love biting the heads off these babies, just as I used to do when I was a child. Not just the usual gummy chewy sweets, you can tell they are made with extra care by the way they don't all stick together in the bag.
A rating of 5 out of 5 Stars By Kelly from UK - England on 03-10-2013 These are the best Jelly Babies in my opinion, and trust me, i've tried a lot of Jelly Babies! These are dusted in a fine floury textured powder to stop them sticking together, but gives them a velvety smooth outside... They have a slightly differently textured outer coating of matt jelly, while the inside jelly has a dazzling crystalline look. Bassetts are, I believe, the original jelly babies... originally launched by Bassetts after WW1 and called "Peace babies". They are delicious.... and moreish.. which is why they come in big bags or even bigger boxes :-)
A rating of 4 out of 5 Stars By Maria Teresa from Italy on 18-09-2013 i never used to get these when i was a kid because my mother didn't like me biting the heads off! I love their fruity taste and the slightly 'crisp' outer coating of jelly. Very tasty and surprisingly not to sickly sweet. Kids love them too, so it's worth getting a large bag of them.

If you want to know how a relationship will manifest, look at the composite chart. It's the final word on how, or if, you and your partner will create a union. Which brings up the question of composite dealbreakers. Are there any red flags that guarantee a relationship will not work out? Well, there are no guarantees. I believe that, if you and your partner are ready and willing, you can encourage a relationship (whose time has come) to reach its full potential. But the fact remains that some relationships face major obstacles, and those obstacles are immediately apparent in the composite chart.
Get your customized composite report for insight into how the planets play out in your relationship. ››
Composite Mars square the composite North and South Nodes is an aspect that can appear when there is a strong desire for you and your partner to be together, but external circumstances create blockages. The composite South Node represents the relationship's incarnation in a past life, and the North Node is the relationship's path forward. Any composite planet squaring the nodes points to the reappearance of past life obstacles. When composite Mars is involved, there seems to be an extra level of challenge. Mars represents the actions you and your partner take together, and your sexual energy as a couple. When it squares the nodes, this action/attraction seems to go against the current. There is something about the relationship that was (in a past life) forbidden or inappropriate. And it was the sexual component (Mars) that made it inappropriate. In this life, that sticking point is repeated, although not in exactly the same way. Relationships with this aspect have a great deal of difficulty getting off the ground. They may manifest as a brief fling, long-term affair, or unrequited attraction. But there is something preventing the union from gelling into a complete commitment, where both parties are free to be with each other.

Keycaps for Keyboards
One of the coolest features of mechanical keyboards is the ability to customise the appearance of your keyboard. Most boards come with a keycap puller to pull your keycaps off for cleaning purposes. However, you can use this to swap your keycaps over to modify the look of your keyboard.
A Cherry MX switch is a cross shaped stem, and the keycap pushes into place with minimal fuss. This is a great way to get a unique look and you don't need any specialist expertise to achieve a custom look.
If you are feeling brave, you can also get blank key caps for your board for ultimate 1337 points.
Keycaps come in many shapes and sizes, some are backlighting compatible too. The main two materials used for keycaps are ABS plastic Keycaps which are generally cheaper to produce and normally come as standard on most mechanical keyboards. The other option is PBT keycaps which are made of a higher grade plastic and are much harder wearing and have a more premium feel to type on also.

»Diss-track, I know you won't respond«, lyder det på FrankILY, og mens albummet rent musikalsk er alt andet end stor kunst, viser det utvivlsomt noget om fanskaren, der har det rimelig vildt med at referere til den skudte gorilla Harambe og lave nye versioner af forskellige Frank-tracks som ‘Forrest Gump' og ‘Frank's Track' fra ‘The Life of Pablo'.

The media have zeroed in on discrepancies between Hillary's statements about their emails over the past year and the July 5 announcement from FBI Director James Comey. However, a fascinating new development emerged today to support what Hillary has said about the emails.
At a press briefing, State Department spokesperson John Kirby said two emails marked classified were the result of “human error.”
State Dept spox Kirby just now says two emails that Comey said were 'marked classified' were wrongly marked, and were not classified. — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) July 6, 2016
At State Dept briefing Kirby says only 2 known emails alleged to have been marked classified were not actually classified at the time — Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) July 6, 2016
UPDATE: according to St. Dept today, those two marked emails weren't classified….so 0 out of 55,000 emails were marked classified at time — Eric Boehlert (@EricBoehlert) July 6, 2016
Comey had said in their statement: “Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information.” The New York Times nailed down that “very small number” to two:
While [Comey] did not identify any, they were evidently referring to two emails that one of Mrs. Clinton's close aides, Monica R. Hanley, sent to prepare them for telephone calls with foreign leaders, according to a State Department official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. One email, dated Aug. 2, 2012, noted that Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, was stepping down as special envoy trying to mediate the war in Syria. A second one, sent in April 2012, discussed Mrs. Clinton's call to the newly inaugurated president of Malawi.
So it appears that the only two emails that were “marked” classified (or to be more precise “bore markings indicating the presence of classified information”) in Hillary's tens of thousands of emails were erroneously marked as such.
Ultimately, this entire email story comes down to the conclusion, from the New York Times, that Comey “did not claim that Mrs. Clinton's behavior had compromised any program or operation.”
The Times quotes Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, as saying, “There was no assertion of damage to national security because of this episode.”
No assertion of damage and no evidence of damage.
Most importantly, no bad intent on Hillary's part. None whatsoever. Simply a mistake they regret making. And a lot of bluster over something that could have happened – but didn't.
UPDATE: It's officially over.

VIA Metropolitan Transit rolled out its “first high-capacity transit service” Saturday with sleek, elongated buses that run on compressed natural gas, and held a grand opening for a transit hub at the South Texas Medical Center, where riders can get real-time update on when the next bus will arrive.
“Today, we move into the 21st century,” VIA Chairman Henry Muñoz told some 400 people who celebrated the launch with balloons and mariachi music.
Muñoz and Mayor Julián Castro heralded the new service as a breakthrough milestone for San Antonio's transit system, which they relied on while growing up.
Muñoz recalled watching through the window as their mother, who cleaned homes, would board a bus in the morning “so they could make sure that my life was better than hers.” Castro said they and brother Joaquin often rode VIA's No. 68 Guadalupe Street bus.
The new Prímo service will help San Antonio compete with other cities that “get basic things right” as a place to live and work, Castro said.
The service — which provides shorter wait times, free Wifi and other amenities — will improve the quality of life for early risers who are “the lifeblood of our city” and encourage more people to ride transit, they said.
“And that's why bus rapid transit is such a fantastic addition to San Antonio and Bexar County,” Castro added.
Riders can experience the service for free today from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Regular weekday service will begin at 4 a.m. Monday.
Tracy Manning, VIA's manager of route planning, said the new buses, which are 20 feet longer than regular buses, with an articulated hinge in the middle to help round corners, provide a service that is “fast, frequent and friendly.” Buses will run every 10 minutes during peak periods.
From the Medical Center, they will travel on Fredericksburg Road, from Wurzbach Road to Interstate 10, then take I-10 to downtown. Every third northbound Prímo bus will continue on Fredericksburg and I-10 to the University of Texas at San Antonio.
“It's going to be the most frequent service in our system,” Manning said.
The new transit center at Babcock Road and Medical Drive has a modern art-deco style, with rolling curves, and windows providing natural lighting in a spacious indoor lobby that seats 60 people.
The street markers denoting the Prímo service are a bright red-orange — “rorange,” a term coined by transit officials.
The concrete walls, with flowering vines, buffer sound. A detention pond serves as drainage and a solar farm generates 130 kilowatt-hours per year as supplemental power for the building.
Lynda Guerra, who works as a custodian, said they liked Prímo's “smooth ride” after a round trip to downtown and back with their family and a friend.
“I'm going to start riding the bus again,” Guerra said.
Hope Cooper, an Air Force veteran who has been in a wheelchair with a spinal cord injury since 1989, said the spaces for the disabled were user-friendly. They said they can use it to go downtown with their friends, rather than relying on VIA's paratransit van service.
“We had access to just about every place we needed, including Market Square and the courthouse,” Cooper said. “With this, I can go with my buddies to Rivercenter mall.”
The 16 Prímo buses, which each cost $878,000, were purchased with federal transit funds, paired with a 20 percent local match.
Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff said San Antonio finally is moving quickly toward a balanced transportation network that gives people choices between cars and public transit, and between suburban living and life in a revitalized central city.

Ninety-five years after players from the Chicago White Sox allegedly threw the 1919 World Series, learn the story behind one of professional baseball's most notorious scandals.
Just how the “Big Fix” of 1919 played out remains a subject of considerable debate among baseball historians. Accounts differ, but the scheme may have first materialized a few weeks before the World Series, when White Sox first baseman C. Arnold “Chick” Gandil and a gambler named Joseph “Sport” Sullivan met to discuss the possibility of Sox players throwing the championship. Gamblers had long been greasing the palms of disgruntled ballplayers in exchange for inside tips, but attempting to rig an entire World Series was a rare and perhaps even unprecedented proposition. Gandil later claimed they were initially skeptical that it could work, but they eventually agreed that they and a few co-conspirators would throw the series in exchange for a hefty payout of around $100,000. They soon enlisted White Sox pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Claude “Lefty” Williams, shortstop Charles “Swede” Risberg and outfielder Oscar “Happy” Felsch into the scheme. Third baseman Buck Weaver was in on the early stages of the plot before pulling out, and utility infielder Fred McMullin was cut in after they overheard the players talking about the deal. Power hitter “Shoeless” Joe Jackson was also approached.
Arnold Rothstein
As Gandil recruited their conspirators, Sullivan and a tangled web of crooks that may have included “Sleepy” Bill Burns, Bill Maharg and Abe Attell began raising the bribe money. New York mob leader Arnold Rothstein may have been a major player, but their involvement has never been proven, and evidence suggests that Gandil and their co-conspirators may have hatched multiple deals with different syndicates. “They not only sold [the series]” Abe Attell later claimed, “but they sold it wherever they could get a buck.” Bookies had previously had the Sox winning the World Series over the underdog Cincinnati Reds by as much as three-to-one, but the odds shifted after those in the know began betting heaps of cash on the Reds. As the championship drew near, the streets buzzed with rumors that several White Sox players were in the pocket of high stakes gamblers.

Suspicions that the championship was “in the bag” only increased after the White Sox and the Reds met on October 1 for the first game of what was then a best-of-nine World Series. After hitting a batter with one of their first pitches—supposedly a signal that the fix was on—Eddie Cicotte went on to make a series of uncharacteristic blunders from the mound. Chicago lost the game 9-1, leading the New York Times to marvel, “Never before in the history of America's biggest baseball spectacle has a pennant-winning club received such a disastrous drubbing in an opening game…” The faulty play continued in game two, when Sox pitcher Lefty Williams gifted the Reds a 4-2 win after walking three batters in a row.
The White Sox continued losing over the next few games, and by October 6, the series stood at 4-1 in favor the Reds. Everything was proceeding as planned, yet according to later accounts, many of the crooked Sox players had begun to grow restless. They had purportedly arranged to receive their bribes in five $20,000 installments—one after each loss—but the gamblers had failed to deliver the full amount. After game five, the furious ballplayers supposedly called off the fix once and for all and resolved to play to win for the rest of the series. Over the next two games, the Sox sprang to life, winning 5-4 and 4-1 and putting themselves back in the race for the championship. Backing out of a deal with gangsters proved difficult, however, and several of the players later hinted at having received threats against their families. Whether because of intimidation or merely an unexpectedly strong opposition, the Sox went on to lose game eight to the Reds 10-5, giving Cincinnati their first ever World Series win.
The eight White Sox players implicated in the scandal
Rumors of a fix continued to persist in the months after the championship defeat. Leading the charge was sportswriter Hugh Fullerton, who investigated the 1919 series and later wrote a famous article for the New York Evening World titled “Is Big League Baseball Being Run for Gamblers, With Players in the Deal?” Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey was quick to shrug off any reports of impropriety, saying, “I believe my boys fought the battles of the recent World Series on the level.” Despite their claims to the contrary, evidence would later show that Comiskey had been tipped off about a possible fix early in the series and may have attempted to bury the story to protect their business interests.
Baseball's leading figures appeared content to let the 1919 World Series go unexamined, and it largely did until August 31, 1920, when evidence surfaced that gamblers had rigged a regular season game between the Cubs and the Phillies. A grand jury convened to investigate, and speculation soon turned to the previous year's World Series. Around that same time, gambler Bill Maharg went public with an account of their own involvement in the fix. As the accusations mounted, Eddie Cicotte decided to testify before the grand jury. During a tearful mea culpa, the pitcher admitted involvement in the scandal, saying, “I don't know why I did it…I needed the money. I had the wife and kids.” Shortly afterwards, star hitter “Shoeless” Joe Jackson testified and admitted to having accepted $5,000 from their teammates. Over the next few days, Lefty Williams and Oscar Felsch also confessed their involvement.
In October 1920, Gandil, Cicotte, Williams, Risberg, Felsch, McMullin, Weaver and Jackson—now dubbed the “Black Sox”—were indicted on nine counts of conspiracy. While they were lambasted in the media for “selling out baseball,” the players coasted through their June 1921 trial after all the paper records relating to their grand jury confessions vanished under mysterious circumstances. Many now believe that Comiskey and gambling kingpin Arnold Rothstein arranged for the papers to be stolen as part of a cover up. Whatever the cause, the prosecution's case disappeared along with the confessions. On August 2, 1921, the Black Sox were found not guilty on all counts.
“Black Sox” players on trial
The ballplayers' vindication would not last long. Only a day after the acquittal, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, recently appointed as baseball's first commissioner, decreed that all eight players were permanently banned from organized baseball. “Regardless of the verdict of juries,” Landis wrote, “no player who throws a ballgame, no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ballgame, no player that sits in conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing a game are discussed and does not promptly tell their club about it, will ever play professional baseball.”
The edict effectively destroyed the careers of the eight Black Sox. Some of them later tried to win reinstatement to the league, but Commissioner Landis ensured that none of the disgraced ballplayers ever set foot in a big league diamond again. The decision was especially harsh toward Buck Weaver, who was banned even though they supposedly dropped out of the plot before it started. Joe Jackson, meanwhile, had admitted to accepting money from the Black Sox, but later claimed that they were an unwilling participant and had tried to tip Comiskey to the scheme. “Shoeless Joe's” true level of involvement remains unclear, but their series best batting average of .375 suggests they took no active role in throwing the 1919 championship.
If Landis' blanket ban helped cleanse baseball's damaged image, it also served to sweep the Black Sox scandal under the rug. Chick Gandil and others would later produce contradictory accounts of what happened, leading to still unanswered questions about who was really involved in the 1919 World Series fix and to what degree the games were thrown. Arnold Rothstein, one of the most likely suspects for organizing or financing the fix, was never even charged with a crime. They would maintain their innocence for the rest of their life, despite widespread rumors that they made a fortune betting on the series.
What The End To Net Neutrality Means For Internet Streaming
NPR's Elise Hu talks to former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler about what the FCC decision to end so-called net neutrality means and what it will mean to consumers of internet streaming.
ELISE HU, HOST:
The Federal Communications Commission will vote next month to remove nearly every rule on the books that protects the idea of net neutrality. Basically that means Internet service providers like Comcast or AT&T could go from being neutral gateways to everything on the Internet to gatekeepers. They could decide to load some sites more slowly or impose fees for faster service. The rules being repealed are just 2 years old. The FCC's Republican chair, Ajit Pai, says they've hurt the online economy. Here's what they told NPR's Morning Edition today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
AJIT PAI: The Internet wasn't broken in 2015 when these heavy-handed regulations were adopted. And once we remove them, I think we'll continue to see the infrastructure investment that will benefit digital consumers and entrepreneurs alike.
HU: Let's get a response to that from Pai's predecessor. Tom Wheeler chaired the FCC when it approved these rules in 2015. Tom Wheeler, thanks for joining us.
TOM WHEELER: Thanks for having me.
HU: Well, first, net neutrality is a term that can cause our eyes to glaze over. But obviously it's been central to your career. So how do you explain it to people in your life to get folks engaged on the issue?
WHEELER: We actually said that we need to talk about this in terms of the open Internet rather than the abstract term net neutrality because that really describes what's going on here. We're talking about - is the Internet, which is the most powerful and pervasive platform in the history of the planet - is it going to be open to all comers, or is it going to be a toll road that the consumer has to pay to get special services or that service providers have to pay to be able to reach the consumer? And what we said was, no, this is an asset that is key to the economy of the 21st century, and it must be open to all.
HU: Your successor though, Chairman Ajit Pai, says the Internet wasn't broken in 2015 when you and the commission approved these rules. They call them heavy-handed. So can you point to anything that got better for consumers over the past two years because of these regulations?
WHEELER: After these rules were adopted, we have seen investment in broadband increase. We have seen VC investment in new startups that use the Internet increase. And we have seen an expansion in the kinds of services that are available to consumers. This has been a success.
The Internet was indeed broken before the 2015 rules were put in place because the companies were blocking content. They were throttling content. And they even went to court to tell the court under oath that they intended to have fast lanes and slow lanes so that consumers would have to pay more. So with all due respect to the current chairperson, they are making up something out of whole cloth that was denied under oath (laughter) by the Internet service providers in court.
HU: So what would be the effect on consumers now under the changes that are proposed?
WHEELER: Oh, wow. If you like your cable company, then you'll love what's going to happen to the Internet because suddenly the rules - instead of being open, the rules now will resemble very similar to what your rules are if you're a cable company where the cable company decides who you can get access to, what your prices will be.
HU: I'm curious, though. Something confusing in all of this is that both sides of the debate say that they support the idea of an open Internet. So sort through this for us. What's the debate over if both sides say, hey, we love the open Internet?
WHEELER: I think you've got to start with one key fact, and that is what we found when we were developing the open Internet rules - is that two-thirds of American consumers have at most one choice as to who they can get their Internet access from. That means we're dealing with a monopoly. And when those monopolies turn around and say, oh, we're for an open Internet, what they're really saying is, we're for an open Internet because we can make the rules. And we said, no, we think that the representative of the consumer ought to make those rules.
HU: Tom Wheeler served as chairperson of the Federal Communications Commission from November 2013 to January of this year. He's now a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. Tom Wheeler, thanks for coming on the program.
WHEELER: Thanks, Elise.

At RailsConf this year, I saw "Nothing is Something" by Sandi Metz. In it, they explained the Null Object Pattern. The example they used was:
A program looks through the database for a number of animals by their ID, and then prints the name of each animal. In the case that the animal for a particular ID is missing, it had to print "missing animal" instead.
The naive solution was:
animals = ids . map { | id | Animal . find ( id ) } animals . each do | animal | if animal . nil? puts "missing animal" else puts animal . name end end
The prescription of the Null Object Pattern calls for substituting a "Null Animal" class, which Sandi calls MissingAnimal :
class MissingAnimal def name "missing animal" end end
Then, a wrapper class GuaranteedAnimal was created which will always return an animal, whether it be a real animal or a "missing" animal:
class GuaranteedAnimal self . find ( id ) Animal . find ( id ) || MissingAnimal . new end end
This allows the original code to be written as:
animals = ids . map { | id | GuaranteedAnimal . find ( id ) } animals . each { | animal | puts animal . name }
Notice that we've removed the need for any if statements. In fact, Sandi made a real big deal about not wanting to use if statements. If you watch the beginning of their talk, they go into how to write if's without if statements, but only via message passing to the true and false classes - a style that Smalltalk uses.
Null Object for Lists
I want to take this even further. Specifically, I would like to apply this principle to the following scenario:
You are writing a search page, and you display the list of results on the page as some <li> 's inside an <ul> . But what happens when no results are returned? To provide good user feedback, you want to display a message saying something like "No results were found."
The obvious way to implement this, usually in some sort of HTML templating language, is to use the equivalent of an if statement. In ERB, this would look like:
<h1>Search Results</h1> <% if results . size == 0 %> <p>No results were found.</p> <% else %> <ul> <% results . each do | result | %> <li><a href=" <%= result . url %> "> <%= result . title %> </li> <% end %> </ul> <% end %>
Pretty standard, right? But, I want to do this without using if statements, can I use the null object pattern here?
It'll take a little thinking outside the box. In order to substitute a method invocation in place of an if statement, we'd have to make it so that in one case, the method is resolved in one class, while in the other case, the message is resolved in a different class. We can do this if the empty list has a different type than a non-empty list. So, we need:
class EmptyList ... end class NonEmptyList ... end
This has implications. It means that if an item were added to an empty list, then its type would have to change to an non-empty list. Can you change the type of object in runtime? Maybe Ruby can, because Ruby can do pretty crazy things. But, I am not going to go there. What I will do is use an immutable list - a la Clojure, where in order to make a modification to the list, you must create a new list, because the old one ain't ever gonna change. The new one though, could be of a different type and you'd never know it - MUAHAHAHA! In other words:
> list1 = EmptyList . new < EmptyList > > list2 = list . append ( bob ) < NonEmptyList >[ bob ] # list 2 gotten by appending bob to list 1 > list1 < EmptyList > # original list stays empty
I am going to implement a linked list using this idea. A linked list implementation needs the operations car , cdr , and cons - in LISP speak, but I am going to use these less cryptic names:
first - to get the first item of the list
- to get the first item of the list rest - to get a new list containing all but the first item of the list
- to get a new list containing all but the first item of the list append(item) - to get a new list containing item plus the items that are in the original list
This is how it's going to work:
class EmptyList def first nil end def rest self end def append ( item ) # if you append an item to an empty list, you # get an non-empty list, whose first item is the # item, and its "rest of the list" is an empty list NonEmptyList . new ( item , self ) end end class NonEmptyList def initialize ( item , rest ) @item = item @rest = rest end def first @item end def rest @rest end def append ( item ) NonEmptyList . new ( item , self ) end end
To traverse a list, one would use recursion to iterate down the list through the rest method. For convinience, I will add an method that works like Array#each . Here's NonEmptyList 's implementation of each :
class NonEmptyList ... def each ( & block ) block . call ( first ) # call the block for the first item rest . each ( & block ) # defer to the rest of the list end end
For EmptyList#each , it should simply do nothing:
class EmptyList ... def each end end
Now, that we have that, we can do:
list = EmptyList . new . append ( 1 ) . append ( 2 ) list . each do | item | puts item end
Sweet! Now that a basic list implementation is done, we can apply the null object pattern and vary the display of the list based on whether the list is empty or not:
class EmptyList ... def render "<p>No results were found.</p>" end end class NonEmptyList ... def render items = [] # cheating here: convert to # array to use its join method each do | item | items . push ( " <li>
" + %Q( <a href=" #{ item . url } "> #{ item . title } </a>
) + " </li>" ) end %Q(<ul>
#{ items . join ( "
" ) }
</ul>) end end
Now let's exercise these render methods by creating some search results:
Result = Struct . new ( :title , :url ) results = EmptyList . new . append ( Result . new ( "Null Object Pattern" , "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern" )) . append ( Result . new ( "Introduce Null Object" , "http://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceNullObject.html" )) . append ( Result . new ( "Q & A: is nothing something?" , "https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1235" ))
Print them out, and...
> puts results . render < ul > < li > < a href = "https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1235" > Q & A : is nothing something? < /a> </ li > < li > < a href = "http://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceNullObject.html" > Introduce Null Object < /a> </ li > < li > < a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern" > Null Object Pattern < /a> </ li > < /ul>
And now to render an empty list...
> puts EmptyList . new . render < p > No results were found . < /p>
Sweet! We did it, and we did it without using a single if statement. You can find the full source code here.
But...
There is something very troubling about this solution though. What if we wanted to use this linked list implementation to render anything other than search results? We are toast! A broader problem is that we now have presentation code inside of what is supposed to be a general data utility.
But in fact, this problem exists in Sandi's animal example as well. "missing animal" is not the name of any animal. The reason it was chosen as the replacement text is - I would assume - that the programmer knows it will be rendered onto some page where substituting that text would make sense for the user. Therefore, the animal example also has presentation logic inside its model layer.
How can we solve this? Funny you should ask that! That is the topic of the next post. See you then.
Several developing countries are rising in the ranks of overall well-being after decades of struggling to keep up with Western nations, an annual report shows.
The World Happiness Report, an index that rates nations based on factors such as income and life expectancy, released its 2017 list Monday at the United Nations. The list doesn't contain any surprises among the happiest or least happy nations, where Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and Finland rounded out the top and the Central African Republic, Syria, Tanzania, and Burundi came in among the bottom of the list.
But there is movement among some developing nations, including Nicaragua, Latvia, Sierra Leone, and Ecuador, which all saw the highest jumps in their happiness ratings when indexes from 2005-2007 were compared to 2014-2016 numbers. Meanwhile, nations on the regressing side included many Western countries, such as the United States, Italy, and Greece, as well as impoverished nations like the Central African Republic, Rwanda, and Ukraine.
Nicaragua came in 43rd, Ecuador in 44th, Latvia in 54th, and Sierra Leone in 106th, overall, putting each (aside from Sierra Leone) in the top half of nations. Sierra Leone made the third-largest gain on the happiness scale, after Latvia (No. 2) and Nicaragua (No. 1).
Analysts say that healthy life expectancy and gross domestic product per capita are two of the strongest determining factors in gauging a country's happiness. But among nations that have generally ranked lower, such as developing countries in Latin America, Africa, or Eastern Europe, seemingly slight changes in those factors, or in issues of violent conflict and volatile political systems, can facilitate larger shifts, causing countries to see significant progress.
“When people are at the very bottom, reducing conflict and reducing poverty are two things that will produce progress,” Carol Graham, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, tells The Christian Science Monitor. “At the individual level and at the aggregate level, income matters. It's not the only variable by any means, but it gives people choices in life.”
In addition to income, the index takes into account healthy life expectancy, having social support in times of trouble, generosity, freedom, and trust, measured by corruption in government and business. In each of the 155 nations included in the index, researchers also poll 1,000 people, beginning with this question:
“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top,” the poll says. “The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”
The happiest countries are ones in which people have democratic voting rights, safety networks and support systems, and feel free to make their own decisions and pursue certain goals.
For countries on the rise, a number of factors can be at play. In Nicaragua and Ecuador, periods of political unrest have begun to subside, bringing greater trust in government, drops in conflict, and subsequently new opportunities to some. In Russia, which also jumped, a growing national pride in President Vladimir Putin and economic revival could play a role, Dr. Graham says.
But for those on the decline, such as now ranked 19th US, identity politics and shifting demographics, as well as mistrust in the political system can cause a drop.
“The [US] is mired in a roiling social crisis that is getting worse,” Jeffrey Sachs, an economics professor at Columbia University in New York, wrote in the report. “Yet the dominant political discourse is all about raising the rate of economic growth.”
The solution, they argue, could lie in reducing income inequality, reforming the political system to rid out corruption in finances, and fostering improved relationships between immigrants and native-born Americans.
Economists tend to see some divide on the entwined role of money and happiness, drawing various conclusions on its impact on both individual and national happiness.
“Contrary to setpoint theory, life events such as marriage, divorce, and serious disability or disease do have lasting effects on happiness,” writes Richard Easterlin, an economics professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, in a report titled "The Economics of Happiness." Professor Easterlin, who is best known for an economic theory bearing their name, argues a higher GDP does not correlate with greater self-reported levels of happiness among citizens of a country. “Contrary to what economic theory assumes, more money does not make people happier.”

But that also has a range. Sufficient income allows people to make choices and to think about their lives long term, rather than focusing on day-to-day stressors and concerns.
“Being destitute and happiness do not go together,” Graham says. “What's interesting is not that income is completely irrelevant, it's relevant. But it's trying to get a handle on these other things which matter just as much, if not more” that tells the whole story.
I feel a bit of uncertainty about broaching this subject on a day set aside for unity. But I couldn't help but mention it after reading this opinion piece by Jamie Malanowski from the Times on May 25th. The gist is that there are 10 U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals. At the risk of stating the obvious, these are men who broke their allegiance to the United States, fought against the United States and either directly or indirectly were responsible for killing numerous members of the United States Army (mainly Army, though Marines and Sailors too.)
This is a complicated story, there are a lot of choices and compromises that were made to stitch the American union back together in its inner places, after it had been forced back together by military victory.The Civil War ended almost 150 years ago. And from this distant perspective most of us see it as a short interlude in the country's history when the country briefly broke in two and then was put back together. Today we treat it as pretty much a given that after 1865 it was never again seriously considered that the South might be another country or might again try to break the federal union. Looking at the full expanse of human history, that's not the only or most likely outcome. And it's not an accident. If you look at the political and cultural history of the United States in the 35 years after the Civil War, a number of decisions were made to make that possible.
One of the most obvious and most damaging was the decision to cede to the Southern States the decisions about how it would deal with the millions of black citizens created by the War. But that was part of a whole fabric of choices – some explicit and other implicit – to gauze over what had actually happened in the war.
The official records of the Civil War were published by the War Department as The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. Even here you can see the process of normalization and forgetting mid-way. You have the title “War of the Rebellion” which captures both the official and actual version of what the war actually was – a rebellion against the government of the United States, a description you almost never hear today. And at the same time you have the “Union” and “Confederate” Armies described on equal terms. Needless to say, the U.S. government never accepted that such a thing as the ‘Confederate States of America' existed. They were all U.S. citizens in a state of rebellion against the legitimate government.
As part of the process of national reconciliation those facts were intentionally forgotten. The U.S. government eventually took over the care of Confederate graveyards. And on the cultural level, the two sides were increasingly seen on equal terms. Two sides, two armies with equal valor, honor and history. But all part of the past. If you dig a little deeper you see that part of this tacit compromise was the decision to mollify Southern defeat by elevating Southern ‘valor' above that of the North. It's no surprise this was done in the South. But in the 1880s and 1890s this was increasingly done in the North as well. A tacit bargain: you lost, we won, and we're all living in the USA. But we'll let you win in the battle of memory and valor and nostalgia. Both a cause and effect of this national reconciliation was the slackening Northern commitment to protecting the former slaves, now citizens in the South, and their eventual abandonment.
Coming from my point of view, it genuinely seems outrageous that Confederate generals who were – let's not paper over the facts – traitors are honored by having massive U.S. military bases named after them. There's a major difference between respecting and honoring sacrifice – which exists separately from the political movement you're fighting on behalf of – and honoring people in this way.
Today most of us probably see the problem as the fact that these guys fought to protect slavery. And whatever revisionist nonsense you hear out there that is unquestionably true. But that's only one part of the equation. At least as big in my mind is that these men were traitors – rebels against the democratic ideal and the federal union around which any American patriotism has to be based. Taken together these two things are a really, really big deal. One can only begin to imagine what Union soldiers who died on the battlefield would make of all this.
Clearly, the federal government's abandonment of its African-American citizens is the biggest harm done by all of this. But there are myriad related harms, perhaps the most important of which is the valorization of the Confederacy itself and all the knock-on effects of Confederate flags flying over state capitols and the way that the myth of Southern valor has become a touchstone for the still potent force of political white supremacist groups.
As you can see, I have pretty strong feelings about this, always have. I could go on and on on this point. If it were up to me, the whole ‘Confederate' entity would simply be treated as a rebellion, no different from other American citizens who've gone to war against the United States. And yet I also recognize that I and all the rest of us live in a country that has benefited for more than a century from not having perennial paramilitary conflicts, a whole section of the country that has to be held in check by force. It's very easy to ignore this possible alternative American history – one arguably bought by the valorization and glamorization of the Confederacy and the decision to consign what were then known as the ‘freedmen' to a century of semi-freedom.
I won't conclude this with any grand conclusion. Despite my own commitments, perhaps because of them, I'd rather focus on the complexity of the choices Americans made a century ago. Or to put it a bit differently, to be honest about how many – but not all – of us have benefited from those choices. But circling back to the original question, perhaps this is a question worth revisiting. Perhaps we've come far enough – regardless of the equities at stake 100 or 75 years ago – that we can revisit this question.
Why are men who turned traitor against our country for a terrible cause and were responsible for the deaths of so many American soldiers honored by having some of our largest military bases named in their honor?
It is no secret to readers that I think we can best balance energy supply and demand using pure economic transactions. Whatever you feel about flash trading, those markets with millions of 14 millisecond transactions prove that we know how to run markets fast enough to manage even the most demanding decision making on smart grids. Free energy, that is energy markets unencumbered price and reliability arbitrage, is certainly the fastest path to the technologies we need to balance supply with the increasingly volatile supple we foresee. But today's utilities serve a social justice purpose that I have been unable to reconcile in my mind with free energy until now.
We need free energy because we need to unbundle two of the most significant services provided alongside today's energy delivery; availability risk arbitrage and price risk arbitrage. These services create a moral hazard we can no longer afford. Availability risk arbitrage removes performance incentives for end nodes to install systems for energy storage and generation. Price risk arbitrage reserves all economic incentives for energy storage and generation to the grid, where it is too expensive and innovation adoption is, of necessity, to slow to support the type of venture creation we have seen in high tech.
The basic problem is that our electric grid operates with lower margins for error than it ever has before, and current policy is to reduce them further. No community is clamoring for more power lines in its back yard even as our houses are filled with ever more energy consuming equipment for computing, telecommunications, and entertainment. It is becoming too expensive, in generation costs, infrastructure capacity, and social will to maintain constant oversupply of traditional energy. We wish to use new energy sources that are unpredictable and episodic. Attempts to smooth out supply volatility at the grid re too expensive or too few. (Ask me sometime why natural gas sales went up when gas generation was replaced by wind in Colorado.) The ability of the grid to supply availability arbitrage is failing.
With fixed prices, the economic incentives for end nodes to participate in energy generation and storage are non-existent. The most basic market rule is bought low and sell high. Without dynamic pricing, the rule for homes and commercial buildings is sell low (wholesale) and buy high (retail). Efforts by local regulators to repeal that rule are as artificial as efforts to repeal gravity.
Dynamic pricing changes all that. With the volatility of energy supply fully exposed, end nodes will buy technologies to manage their risk. With the volatility of energy prices fully exposed, end nodes will find the business case to manage their power purchases. Bottlenecks in the power grid will result in local congestion pricing, letting the true costs neighborhood infrastructure decisions to be seen by the public.
Utilities today must play not to lose rather than to win. They cannot adapt new technologies quickly because they must always be reliable. Market actors that cannot accept risk, cannot afford to innovate. End nodes can voluntarily accept risk, and so can afford to adopt new technology. If Denver, where we met this month to form the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP), is plunged into darkness for a week, it is a dire outcome; if my home fails for a week, is provides entertainment to my neighbors. The difference between grid-level innovation and end-node innovation is the difference between tragedy and comedy.
Smart grids will transfer risk to their end nodes. Economic agents which assume risk will expect to be paid for it. These payments will be the fertilizer for an untold number of new technologies. The best way to transfer risk and payments together is self-balancing, self organizing free markets in energy. Systems that can participate in these markets for us as well as systems that can store or generate energy on-site, will be the reward.
If you want to know what's going on with your Linux server, start with these Linux monitoring commands.
Want to know what's really going on with your server? Then you need to know these essential commands. Once you've mastered them, you'll be well on your way to being an expert Linux system administrator.
Sure, you can use a GUI program to pull up much of the information that these shell commands can give you, depending on the Linux distribution. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and openSUSE, for example, have an excellent graphical configuration and management tool, YaST. And there are universal tools, such as Webmin and cPanel, which can be used on any Linux server.
However, it's a Linux administrator truism that you should run a GUI on a server only when you absolutely must. That's because Linux GUIs take up system resources that could be better used elsewhere. So, while using a GUI program is fine for basic server health checkups, if you want to know what's really happening, turn off the GUI and use these tools from the Linux command shell.
This also means you should start a GUI on a server only when it's required; don't leave it running. For optimum performance, a Linux server should run at runlevel 3, which fully supports networking and multiple users but doesn't start the GUI when the machine boots. If you really need a graphical desktop, you can always get one by running startx from a shell prompt.
If your server starts by booting into a graphical desktop, you need to change this. To do so, head to a terminal window, su to the root user, and use your favorite editor on /etc/inittab.
Once there, find the initdefault line and change it from:
id:5:initdefault:
to
id:3:initdefault:
If there is no inittab file, create it and add the id:3 line. Save and exit. The next time you boot into your server, it will boot into runlevel 3. If you don't want to reboot after this change, you can also set your server's run level immediately with the command:
init 3
Once your server is running at init 3, you can start using the following shell programs to see what's happening inside your server.
iostat
The iostat command shows in detail what your storage subsystem is up to. You usually use iostat to monitor how well your storage subsystems are working in general and to spot slow I/O problems before your clients notice that the server is running slowly. Trust me, you want to spot these problems before your users do!
meminfo and free
Meminfo gives you a detailed list of what's going on in memory. Typically you access meminfo 's data by using another program such as cat or grep . For example,
cat /proc/meminfo
gives you the details of what's going on in your server's memory at any given moment.
For a quick “just the facts” look at memory, you can use the free command. In short, free gives you the overview; meminfo gives you the details.
mpstat
The mpstat command reports on the activities of each of the available CPUs on a multi-processor server. These days, thanks to multi-core processors, that's almost all servers. Mpstat also reports on the average activities of all your server's CPUs. It enables you to display overall CPU statistics per system or per processor. This overview can alert you to possible application problems before they get to the point of annoying users.

netstat
Netstat , like ps , is a Linux tool that administrators use every day. It displays a lot of network-related information, such as socket usage, routing, interface, protocol, network statistics, and more. Some of the most commonly used options are:
-a Show all socket information -r Show routing information -i Show network interface statistics
-s Show network protocol statistics
nmon
Nmon , short for Nigel's Monitor, is a popular open-source tool to monitor Linux system performance. Nmon watches the performance information for several subsystems, such as processor utilization, memory utilization, run queue information, disk I/O statistics, network I/O statistics, paging activity, and process metrics. You can then view nmon 's real-time system measurements via its curses "graphical" interface.
To run nmon , you start the tool from the shell. Once up, you select the subsystems to monitor by typing in its one-key commands. For example, to get CPU, memory, and disk statistics, you type c , m , and d . You can also use nmon with the -f flag to save performance statistics to a CSV file for later analysis.
For day-to-day server monitoring, I find nmon to be the single most useful program in my Linux system management toolkit.
pmap
The https://linux.die.net/man/1/pmap command reports the amount of memory that your server's processes are using. You can use this tool to determine which processes on the server are being allocated memory and whether any of these processes are being piggy with RAM.
ps and pstree
The ps and pstree commands are two of the Linux administrator's best friends. They both provide a list of all currently running processes. The ps command tells you how much memory and processor time the server's programs are using; pstree shows less information but highlights which processes are the children of other processes. Armed with this information, you can spot out-of-control processes and kill them off with Linux's "take no prisoners" kill command.
sar
The sar program is the Swiss Army knife of system monitoring tools. The sar command is actually made up of three separate programs: sar , which displays the data, and sa1 and sa2 , which collect and store it. Once installed, sar creates a detailed overview of CPU utilization, memory paging, network I/O and transfer statistics, process creation activity, and storage device activity. The big difference between sar and nmon is that the former is better at long-term system monitoring; I find nmon to be better at giving me a quick read on my server's status.
strace
Strace is often thought of as a programmer's debugging tool, but it's more than that. It intercepts and records the system calls that are called by a process. This makes it a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool. For example, you can use strace to find out which configuration file a program is actually using when it starts up.
Strace does have one flaw, though. When it's checking out a specific process, that process' performance falls through the floor. Thus, I use strace only when I already have a darned good reason to think that that program is causing trouble.
tcpdump
Tcpdump is a simple, robust network monitoring utility. Its basic protocol analyzing capability enables you to get a rough view of what is happening on your network. To really dig into what's going on with your network, however, you want to use Wireshark (see below).
top
The top command shows what's going on with your active processes. By default, it displays the most CPU-intensive tasks running on the server and updates the list every five seconds. You can sort the processes by PID (Process ID); age, the newest first; time, by cumulative time; and resident memory usage and total time it's been using the CPU since startup. I find this a fast and easy way to see if any process is starting to lurch out of control and into trouble.
uptime
Use uptime to see how long the server has been running and how many users are logged on. It also gives you an overview of the average server load. The optimal value of the load is 1 or less, which means that each process has immediate access to the CPU and there are no CPU cycles lost.
vmstat
For the most part, you use vmstat to monitor what's going on with virtual memory. Linux constantly uses virtual memory to get the best possible storage performance.
If your applications are taking up too much memory, you get excessive page-outs—programs moving from RAM to your system's swap space, which is on the hard drive. Your server can reach a point where it's spending more time managing memory paging than running your applications, a condition called thrashing. When your computer is thrashing, its performance falls through the floor. Vmstat , which can display either average data or actual samples, can help you spot memory pig programs and processes before they bring your server to a crawl.
Wireshark
Wireshark , formerly known as Ethereal (and still often referred to that way), is tcpdump 's big brother, though more sophisticated and with far more advanced protocol analysis and reporting. Wireshark has both a GUI interface and a shell interface. If you do any serious network administration, you must use ethereal . And, if you're using Wireshark/ethereal , I highly recommend Chris Sander's Practical Packet Analysis, a great book on how to get the most out of this useful program.
This is only a 10,000-foot overview of some of Linux's most valuable system monitoring programs. Still, by mastering these programs you'll have taken a first step toward Linux system administrator proficiency.

Yesterday, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark posted this interview they did with Fiji Water co-owner Lynda Resnick on the Huffington Post. (Picture of Newmark and Resnick at left.) Newmark wrote they were looking for some storytelling advice. They went to the right person. Resnick told him:
We have so much competition in the marketplace that if you don't have a real, truthful story behind your product or service, it simply won't be sustainable… Brands that are transparent, authentic and honest rise above their competition… Consumers want to feel good about the products and services they are buying and using.
Resnick's “authentic and honest” is a bit rich, given that Mother Jones and many other media outlets have repeatedly criticized Fiji Water for rampant greenwashing and supporting Fiji's military junta. Just last month, the company was sued for false advertising: Though Fiji Water is touted as “carbon-negative” on billboards, it uses a “forward crediting” model to take credit now for offsets that won't happen until 2037, if ever.
Resnick explained to Newmark that telling a story is “one of the best ways to establish a sense of trust with your consumers…but remember, you can't make it up it has to be real.” Resnick can keep telling stories. Here at Mother Jones, we'll keep it real. For more truthtelling on Fiji Water, see Anna Lenzer's excellent 2009 investigative feature on the company here.

Galactic United Nations HQ, Anward Space Station, Paravox System
The Galactic UN has announced it is preparing to pass legislation that would significantly cap fleet sizes.
A provision called the Lanchester Act would enforce restrictions on so-called 'doomstacks', massive fleets typically consisting of an empire's entire naval capacity that can overpower enemies with quantity rather than quality.
Doomstacks are a potent issue in galactic politics. The right to bear fleets is protected by the 2nd Amendment of the Galactic Constitution, however a recent report by the Public Institute for Space Health (PISH) highlights that doomstacks are one of the leading causes of premature death in the galaxy, second only to Javorian Pox.
The announcement appears to have been stymied by the Galactic UN's perceived inaction on the Cevanti-Yndari conflict, wherein the Cevanti utilized doomstack fleet techniques and decimated the Yndari, in what has been dubbed "the bloodiest conflict of the month - so far." Critics have highlighted the Galactic UN has not passed any fleet-cap legislation since its inception in 2100.
Powerful xenophobic factions have argued any interventions will redefine the core nature of fleet logistics, the role of admirals and the general smugness associated associated with wiping out an early space age civilization with a 150k jump-drive enabled fleet.
Oozi, leader of one of the xenophobic factions told our news team:
"Same old story with the Galactic UN... overreach! They need to realise, fleets don't kill xenos, xenos do. The only way to ensure galactic security is to make sure every spacenation has a doomstack. The bigger, the better."
Legislators state the Lanchester Act is "well within" the Galactic UN's legal authority and consistent with the 2nd Amendment of the Galactic Constitution, a warning to opponents who are likely to challenge them through the judiciary.
Independent observers have warned the legislation will simply push spacenations into building several smaller fleets, and grouping them together, in essence acting as a 'team doomstack'.

Jeff Garzik could be considered one of the guardians of bitcoin. When we caught up with him, they had just finished working with others to stop a network-wide event – a DDoS attack that exploited some stray code in the reference bitcoin client (Bitcoind) to target certain parts of the cryptocurrency's distributed infrastructure.
They became one of the core developers of the Bitcoin protocol after they began working on the project during its early days. They were involved in many of the early forum discussions with the mysterious Satoshi, and even exchanged a private email or two with him.
CoinDesk caught up with them to talk about Satoshi Nakamoto, the open source development community, and where the protocol is headed. One of the first things we asked them was how they viewed its current status.
“Bitcoin is out of its infancy and starting to mature. There are increasing numbers of merchants at BitPay, and people are starting to see it as money over IP,” says Garzik, speaking in their gentle North Carolina drawl.
However, there was no one single event that set the cryptocurrency on a course for success, they assert. It was more of a slow, organic process. Over the last four years, the currency has matured to the point where it has continuous value. That's pretty good going, in their book.
That said, there were promising developments along the way. The Central Bank's activities in Cyprus in April prompted speculation in alternative currencies, they say.
“The FinCEN guidance was a positive turning point too, that happened right around the same time. In my humble opinion, that guidance said that bitcoin is ok. They're not interested in pursuing bitcoin users for selling and buying goods and services in bitcoin – they're interested in regulating the exchange points.”
There was a turning point for Garzik, though, when they were hired by bitcoin payment processor BitPay in May. Overnight, they went from being a developer for Red Hat who worked part-time on the Bitcoin protocol to being a full-time Bitcoin developer. Now, they have more time to spend processing changes to the protocol, and thinking about its technical direction.
The currency's development is following expectations, they say. “We wanted it to be a usable currency for anyone in the world regardless of country or economic status,” they say, adding that it's spreading quickly, although he's still hoping for more accessibility in less wealthy nations, on the African continent, for example. But he's encouraged by bitcoin's fast adoption in China.
This is just the start for bitcoin, however. Today, it's little more than a currency system. “In a payment system you have many products built in many layers,” they say, likening the currency itself to the bottom layer.
“On top of that, you have a layer of banks, and lending, and futures and options trading, and shorting. That's the next step for bitcoin, getting those advanced financial tools layered on top of bitcoin.” They eventually expect to see credit and debit cards denominated in bitcoin.
But Garzik is more of a coder than a macroeconomist. They enjoy the technology behind bitcoin, and with others, has been responsible for many crucial parts of the software that developed out of the Satoshi client.
A conservative team
“Satoshi was a fantastic designer and architect,” they say, adding that the originator of Bitcoin has thought about the system at a very deep level. “He spent a couple of years thinking about the system, and then according to what they said, they had to write the system to prove to themselves that it would work.”
The software went largely unnoticed until news of it hit Slashdot in July 2010. They posted their initial code and it didn't really gain a lot of attention for 6-9 months and then it started getting a few tech mentions. Then it hit Slashdot in July 2010.
But in spite of being an excellent architect and designer, Satoshi's coding practices were unconventional, says Garzik, adding that the original version of Bitcoin was Windows only, not very portable, and “a jumble of source code” with several half-finished projects.
“He was the oracle to which we would go for questions about the system, but they rarely followed standard engineering practices, like writing unit or stress tests or any of the standard qualitative analysis that we'd perform on software,” Garzik recalls. “Several things had to be disabled almost immediately upon public release of Bitcoin because they were obviously exploitable.”
Things have come a long way since then. Now, Bitcoin is a project managed by a group of core developers, with Gavin Andresen, Garzik and a core group of others managing the Github pulls.
“It's a meritocracy like every other open source project. Your contributions are valued if everyone else has consensus about it being a valuable contribution,” Garzik says.
This notion of consensus doesn't necessarily make Bitcoin a push-button democracy, though; the core developers carry ultimate veto, and they're notoriously cautious. “In general, the devs try to be very conservative. Typically, we don't introduce new features. We just try to ensure that the existing ones work.”
That isn't to say that new features can't happen. There's a mechanism called the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BPI) used to put forward proposed new features for the protocol. But it's controlled by the core devs. “If we want to extend it, we'll write up a BIP and publicise it through blogs, and we just try to judge through user feedback whether they like the feature, or don't understand it, or things of that nature.”
Still some gaps to fill
So, does Garzik see the need for any new features in Bitcoin?
“Recurring payments,” they say emphatically. Bitcoin is great if I want to send you some bitcoins once. But if I want to pay regularly for a subscription to, say, an online service, or for regularly updated content, it's flawed. “Bitcoin is a push model where you push payments to someone else, but it isn't in the protocol that you pay someone on a regular basis. That needs to be filled in.”
Another must-have for Garzik is what they call “transaction lifetime determinism” – the retrieval of bitcoin payments from limbo. Transactions on the bitcoin network have to be mined in a block, and the network calls for those transactions to be confirmed. The general recommendation is six confirmations (one per block), but in practice, the number of transactions required by a party is variable.
I don't think it's likely that the second generation will produce any useful, viable long-term cryptocurrency, but I do think that all this experimentation will absolutely inform the Bitcoin ecosystem
If a transaction isn't confirmed, it becomes stuck in the network, and you need an expert to help you recover those funds. “A user always needs to know what is going on with their money. If it isn't confirming after a set period of time, it should just kick the transaction out of the system rather than just sitting around for weeks and months.”
Bitcoin activists and evangelists like me have a bunch of answers. It's borderless, it's irreversible, and there's low risk of fraud. Nonetheless, it's difficult to get on the radar of your average person.
Features like these should go into the core protocol, but there are plenty of other features that Garzik wants to see layered on top of the network, without affecting the core protocol.
Coloured coins is one. Garzik wrote one of the first implementations of this, called Smartcoin. This concept enables attributes to be assigned to a coin, so that it can become a token for ownership. They could be used for everything from exchanging ownership of physical assets, to marking stocks, bonds, and options.
“There are zero modifications needed to support coloured coins today,” they say. “Bitcoin wouldn't need to be upgraded.”
Read part two of CoinDesk's interview with Jeff Garzik, where they reveal their thoughts on alternative currencies, ASIC miners, and getting everyday users on board for bitcoin.
An Interesting Math Problem¶
To illustrate how pyswarm is to be best utilized, we'll start with a complete example, which will be explained step-by-step afterwards:
from pyswarm import pso def banana ( x ): x1 = x [ 0 ] x2 = x [ 1 ] return x1 ** 4 - 2 * x2 * x1 ** 2 + x2 ** 2 + x1 ** 2 - 2 * x1 + 5 def con ( x ): x1 = x [ 0 ] x2 = x [ 1 ] return [ - ( x1 + 0.25 ) ** 2 + 0.75 * x2 ] lb = [ - 3 , - 1 ] ub = [ 2 , 6 ] xopt , fopt = pso ( banana , lb , ub , f_ieqcons = con ) # Optimum should be around x=[0.5, 0.76] with banana(x)=4.5 and con(x)=0
Now let's walk through each section of code. We start off with any necessary imports, in this case it's just the optimizer function pso :
from pyswarm import pso
Then we define the objective function to be minimized, which should be defined like myfunction(x, *args, **kwargs) . In other words, it takes as its first argument an 1-d array-like object, followed by any other (optional) arguments and (again, optional) keyword arguments. The function should return a single scalar value that is minimized. In this example, the banana function:
def banana ( x ): x1 = x [ 0 ] x2 = x [ 1 ] return x1 ** 4 - 2 * x2 * x1 ** 2 + x2 ** 2 + x1 ** 2 - 2 * x1 + 5
Optimizing with constraints is optional, but we include one here to illustrate how it might be done in the con function which has the same call syntax as the objective, but returns an array of values (even if it only has a single value in it):
def con ( x ): x1 = x [ 0 ] x2 = x [ 1 ] return [ - ( x1 + 0.25 ) ** 2 + 0.75 * x2 ]
Rather than specify a starting point for the algorithm, we define the limits of the input variables that the optimizer is allowed to search within. For the sake of clarity, we have defined them prior to calling the optimizer in the objects lb and ub , which stand for lower-bound and upper-bound, respectively:
lb = [ - 3 , - 1 ] ub = [ 2 , 6 ]
That is really all that needs to be defined to run pso , so we then call the optimizer:
xopt , fopt = pso ( banana , lb , ub , f_ieqcons = con )
Using the kwarg f_ieqcons tells the routine that there's a single constraint function that returns an array object.
Once complete, pso returns two objects: 1) the optimal input values and 2) the optimal objective value.
The full call syntax for pso is highly customizable and is defined as follows:
pso ( func , lb , ub , ieqcons = [], f_ieqcons = None , args = (), kwargs = {}, swarmsize = 100 , omega = 0.5 , phip = 0.5 , phig = 0.5 , maxiter = 100 , minstep = 1e-8 , minfunc = 1e-8 , debug = False )
where the minimum required input arguments are:
func : function The function to be minimized lb : array The lower bounds of the design variable(s) ub : array The upper bounds of the design variable(s)
and the optional input keyword-arguments are defined as:
ieqcons : list A list of functions of length n such that ieqcons[j](x,*args) >= 0.0 in a successfully optimized problem (Default: empty list, []) f_ieqcons : function Returns a 1-D array in which each element must be greater or equal to 0.0 in a successfully optimized problem. If f_ieqcons is specified, ieqcons is ignored (Default: None) args : tuple Additional arguments passed to objective and constraint functions (Default: empty tuple, ()) kwargs : dict Additional keyword arguments passed to objective and constraint functions (Default: empty dict, {}) swarmsize : int The number of particles in the swarm (Default: 100) omega : scalar Particle velocity scaling factor (Default: 0.5) phip : scalar Scaling factor to search away from the particle's best known position (Default: 0.5) phig : scalar Scaling factor to search away from the swarm's best known position (Default: 0.5) maxiter : int The maximum number of iterations for the swarm to search (Default: 100) minstep : scalar The minimum stepsize of swarm's best position before the search terminates (Default: 1e-8) minfunc : scalar The minimum change of swarm's best objective value before the search terminates (Default: 1e-8) debug : boolean If True, progress statements will be displayed every iteration (Default: False)
We could have written the constraint function to return a scalar value instead of an array-like object, like:
def con ( x ): x1 = x [ 0 ] x2 = x [ 1 ] return - ( x1 + 0.25 ) ** 2 + 0.75 * x2
In which case, we would have utilized the keyword-argument ieqcons , which takes an array of function handles, like:
xopt , fopt = pso ( banana , lb , ub , ieqcons = [ con ])
The parameters args and kwargs are used to pass any additional parameters to the objective and constraint functions and are not changed during the optimization process.
The parameters omega , phig and phip are a way of controlling how closely the particles move away from their own best known position and the best known position of all the particles in the swarm. These can take any scalar value, but values between 0 and 1 seem to work best.

The driver of a tour bus involved in an accident in which 10 passengers were killed on a highway near Ulsan on Thursday is under fire for abandoning the passengers.
"It has been revealed that the driver, surnamed Lee, was the first to abandon the bus after the accident," Ulsan Ulju police said on Sunday.
Surviving passengers confirmed what happened.
"The driver broke the glass with a fire extinguisher and was the first to exit the bus," a survivor told Joongang Ilbo, a Korean daily.
"Even after abandoning the bus they just sat there doing nothing to help the other passengers."
Police have requested a warrant to charge Lee with professional negligence resulting in death.
The Ulsan District Court has issued the warrant.
"Lee initially said that they crashed into a guardrail after a flat tire," a police spokesperson said.
"However, they later retracted their story and said they were trying to change lanes to enter Ulsan when the accident happened."
Anger continued to grow after it was revealed that Lee had 12 traffic violation charges, including driving without a license and drunk driving.
Bereaved families are demanding strict punishment for Taewha Tour, the company that employed Lee.
"Apart from the driver's negligence, Taewha Tour, who employed a repeated traffic offender, is also to blame for the accident," said one of the breaved.
"We cannot hold the funerals until we know that Taewha will be punished as well."

99 faces. 99 stories. 99 reasons why they are the 99%.
Late last week, a group of everyday Americans used art and the Inside Out Project platform to stand up and declare that they are the 99%. Occupy. Inside. Out. is an effort to document the people behind the Occupy movement and to share their stories; an opportunity to paint a positive portrait of the face of change.
Just as the Occupy movement is spreading across the country and world, the organizers of this action hope other supports of the movement will also use art and Inside Out to stand with the 99%.
Take portraits. Upload them to Inside Out. Get your posters. Contact the organizers of Occupy.Inside.Out to let them know what you are doing. Simple as that.

Configuring ASP.Net Identity OAuth login providers for multi-tenancy
Say for example you have a CMS :) You want to give full control to the developer to manage how their front-end members with authenticate, which could of course include ASP.Net Identity OAuth login providers. At the same time you want to easily allow your CMS to be configured so that ASP.Net Identity OAuth providers can be used for logging into the back office. In this scenario, the same OAuth provider might be used for both front-end and back-office authentication but authenticated under 2 different OAuth accounts. Another example might be if you have multi-tenancy set up for your front-end site and perhaps you want to use the same OAuth login provider but have members authenticate with different OAuth accounts for different domain names.
The defaults
As an example, lets assume that front-end members are configured to authenticate with the ASP.Net Identity Google OAuth2 provider. This is easily done by just following one of the many tutorials out there. Your startup code might look like:
app.UseCookieAuthentication( new CookieAuthenticationOptions .... app.UseExternalSignInCookie(); app.UseGoogleAuthentication( clientId: "123456789..." , clientSecret: "987654321...." );
Great, but I need 2 (or more) Google OAuth2 providers, so what now? I can't just add 2 declarations of:
app.UseGoogleAuthentication( clientId: "123456789..." , clientSecret: "987654321...." ); app.UseGoogleAuthentication( clientId: "abcdef..." , clientSecret: "zyxwv...." );
you'll quickly realize that doesn't work and only one provider instance will actually be used. This is because of the default underlying settings that get used to instantiate the Google provider. Let's have a look at what the default options are in this case. The above code is equivalent to this:
app.UseGoogleAuthentication( new GoogleOAuth2AuthenticationOptions { AuthenticationType = "Google" , ClientId = "123456789..." , ClientSecret = "987654321...." , Caption = "Google" , CallbackPath = new PathString( "/signin-google" ), AuthenticationMode = AuthenticationMode.Passive, SignInAsAuthenticationType = app.GetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(), BackchannelTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60), BackchannelHttpHandler = new System.Net.Http.WebRequestHandler(), BackchannelCertificateValidator = null , Provider = new GoogleOAuth2AuthenticationProvider() });
The AuthenticationType
One very important aspect of the default settings is the AuthenticationType. This is a unique identifier for the provider instance and this is one of the reasons why if you have 2 x UseGoogleAuthentication declarations with the defaults only one will ever be used.
Knowing this, it's clear that each declaration of UseGoogleAuthentication needs to specify custom options and have the AuthenticationType unique amongst them. So we might end up with something like:
//keep defaults for front-end app.UseGoogleAuthentication( clientId: "123456789..." , clientSecret: "987654321...." ); //custom options for back-office app.UseGoogleAuthentication( new GoogleOAuth2AuthenticationOptions { AuthenticationType = "GoogleBackOffice" , ClientId = "abcdef..." , ClientSecret = "zyxwv...." });
If you test this now, you'll find out that only the first declaration is actually working even when you explicitly tell IOwinContext.Authentication.Challenge to use the “GoogleBackOffice” provider.
The CallbackPath
The reason that the default (first) declaration is the one that activates is because the response from Google is sending the request to the path: “/signin-google”, which is the default. The GoogleAuthenticationMiddleware will delegate to the GoogleAuthenticationHandler for each request and inspect the request to see if it should execute. For this logic it checks:
Since the CallbackPath will be the same by default on both above declarations, the first one that is registered will match and the other registered authenticators will be ignored. To fix this we'll need to update the path that Google sends back and then update the second declaration to match that path.
To tell Google to send the request back on a different path, in your Google Developers Console change the REDIRECT URIS value for the second provider:
[Click through to see image]
Then we need to update the 2nd declaration with the custom CallbackPath so that it matches and activates properly:
app.UseGoogleAuthentication( new GoogleOAuth2AuthenticationOptions { AuthenticationType = "GoogleBackOffice" , ClientId = "abcdef..." , ClientSecret = "zyxwv...." , CallbackPath = new PathString( "/custom-signin-google" ) });
Hooray, now it should work!
This concept is the same for most external login providers. For example for the Facebook one the default value is “/signin-facebook”, you'd need to configure Facebook's “Valid OAuth redirect URIs” property with the correct callback path in Facebook's developer portal:
[Click through to see image]
if (Options.CallbackPath.HasValue && Options.CallbackPath == Request.Path) { //If the path matches, auth the request... }
What is SignInAsAuthenticationType?
The last thing to point out is that by default the SignInAsAuthenticationType for each provider will resolve to: app.GetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(), which by default is: DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ExternalCookie = “ExternalCookie”. Each OAuth provider is linked to another middleware that is responsible for actually issuing a user's ClaimsIdentity, so by default this will be “ExternalCookie”. In some cases you won't want the default external cookie authentication middleware to assign the ClaimsIdentity for your OAuth provider, you might need to issue a different ClaimsIdentity or just have more granular control over what happens with the callback for each OAuth provider. In this case you'll need to specify another custom cookie authentication declaration, for example:
app.UseCookieAuthentication( new CookieAuthenticationOptions { AuthenticationType = "CustomExternal" , AuthenticationMode = AuthenticationMode.Passive, CookieName = "MyAwesomeCookie" , ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), //Additional custom cookie options.... });
And then you can link that up to your OAuth declaration like:
//custom options for back-office app.UseGoogleAuthentication( new GoogleOAuth2AuthenticationOptions { AuthenticationType = "GoogleBackOffice" , ClientId = "abcdef..." , ClientSecret = "zyxwv...." , SignInAsAuthenticationType = "CustomExternal" });

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO — “I don't know that,” was the answer from Puerto Rico's Public Security secretary, Héctor Pesquera, when asked about how many people have been detained in the Island's prisons after being processed for committing a serious crime, and not being able to post bail during the curfew period declared a week ago by Governor Ricardo Rosselló after Hurricane María hit Puerto Rico.
Someone else who is not clear about how many people have been jailed for such a transgression is Erik Rolón-Suárez, Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In a conversation with the Center for Investigative Journalism about whether people have been admitted to the criminal system they direct during the past week, Rolón said they could corroborate the number, but when asked about the exact figure, their response was that they had to review in each jail, file by file. “I'd have to corroborate it.”
Something that the Secretary of Corrections could confirm was that the inmates have not been able to make calls to their relatives since María passed. Rolón-Suárez said the department had approved two free calls before and after the hurricane, but because of the collapse in communications that second call had not been possible.
According to official figures, as of Friday, police had intervened with 125 people for curfew violations, of whom 67 have been arrested. The agencies' press spokespersons have been unable to explain which of these arrests have resulted in citations and which in jail sentences.
Pesquera said the intervention protocol “is like any ordinary arrest.” The person is arrested and taken to the nearest police station to record the arrest. It is then presented to a magistrate, and it is determined whether there is cause for arrest. In the event that the offense is only a violation of the curfew, the procedure in force is a court summons. If the accusation is a felony —as is the case when a break-in takes place during the curfew, for example— the magistrate imposes bond. If this bond can not be paid, the defendant is jailed. The Secretary of Public Security said those arrested have been admitted into prisons closest to the place where the crime was committed. However, they were also unable to reveal which those prisons are. They affirmed that the constitutional rights are being guaranteed because Puerto Rico “is a place of law and order.”
The Puerto Rico Police, at the national and municipal levels, is the body authorized to make arrests. Jointly with the military, a Peace Officers Corps also certified by an Executive Order passed on September 28. These Peace Officers, as they are called in the order, are “federal law enforcement officers who have the power to make arrests and are in the performance of their duties.”
“A ‘Peace Officer' is a concept. What they do is that through an executive order the visiting officer is admitted so they can exercise functions as in their local state. Because a police officer in New York can not necessarily practice in Puerto Rico with the same legal protections of the state. In that sense, when an emergency happens, they are recognized as a local officer to perform the duties delegated locally,” was the definition offered by Karixia Ortiz, press officer for Héctor Pesquera.
William Ramírez, executive director for the Puerto Rico Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, was alarmed by police interventions related to the curfew and said they have already received calls and text messages from people close to them about people who were arrested, denouncing the situation.
“I have received notifications. They are arresting people and they are not notifying where they are taking them and they are not offering bail, which is unconstitutional. This is headed the wrong way. When there are emergency situations, [citizens] are willing to give up a lot of rights. An emergency cannot be used as an excuse to suppress people. That can become the new standard and we will not allow that,” they said.
Ramírez also questioned that the curfew was undefined. As they said, a curfew “is a response to an immediate, imminent and defined situation. For a short period of time. When you say indefinite curfew, that's martial law.”
For their part, Osvaldo Burgos, a law professor and chairperson of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican chapter of Amnesty International, lashed out at the government and deemed the matter as “dangerous.”
“The state's last alternative and here it was the first, without pondering other alternatives and their effects. People do not question it. They accept it, because they are afraid, and that is dangerous,”Burgos said.
Someone who concerned about the criminal procedure being followed is criminalist Javier Santiago-Santos, an attorney who questioned the transparency of the protocol within the island's current conditions: communications devastated by the scourge of a hurricane with winds of more than 155 miles per hour; family and legal representation without the ability to communicate and a court system paralyzed without power.
The lawyer also warned about the justice system's lack of experience with this issue. “It's there, and it's up to the state to do whatever it wants to do. What about people who they detain within the curfew? We don't know. We are talking about very new issues. None of this has been resolved by the Supreme Court. There is no jurisprudence,” they said.
At the moment, courts are operating on a limited basis, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and only those in Caguas, Mayagüez, Arecibo and Aguadilla are open. Because of the emergency, the judicial branch is also operating out of police headquarters, the agency notified in a press release.
The island-wide curfew was declared 24 hours after Hurricane María made landfall in Puerto Rico, following several alleged incidents of vandalism and looting reported by the few radio stations that remained on air. The latest version of the executive order was announced Friday, September 29, and now forces citizens to be in their homes from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
The document that accompanies the order says the curfew is effected “to save lives and protect the property, health and safety of all our citizens,” pursuant to Act 211 of 1999. The latter was signed by former Governor Pedro Rosselló to “grant extraordinary powers to the Governor in emergency or disaster situations.” Their son, now Governor Ricardo Rosselló, is the first to invoke it to enact a curfew. There are some municipalities that have similar provisions in their public order codes.
5Earlier this month we had the chance to talk with Z-Wave expert Dr. Christian Paetz. The author of two of the most prominent books about the wireless protocol, Z-Wave Basics: Remote Control in Smart Homes and Z-Wave Essentials, Dr. Paetz is also the primary representative of the Z-Wave Alliance. Here's what we asked them and what they had to share.
Q: Hi and thank you for joining us! We always love getting tips and insights from smart home industry experts, such as yourself. To start things off, can you describe to our audience what you do at Z-Wave Alliance and share the Z-Wave Alliance message in a few short words?
Dr. Paetz: Z-Wave is a technology to let Smart Home devices of different manufacturers work together wirelessly. The Z-Wave Alliance is the consortium of companies that use this technology. Hence, all devices of vendors that joined the Z-Wave Alliance can work together regardless of their brand and origin. There are meanwhile more than 2200 different devices that come from more than 600 members of the alliance.
Q: As you interact with so many new startups and manufacturers, what is your opinion on the current state of the Z-Wave market? What part does innovation have in the manufacturing process of Z-Wave products? What are the most popular home automation products among new and old manufacturers?
Dr. Paetz: The big beauty of Z-Wave is that it's not only a wireless technology but it forms an ecosystem of an interoperable device. They come from very large companies such as Samsung or LG but from small companies too. This is a win-win for both sides. The large companies bring stability and credibility while the small companies offer creativity and innovation.
No wonder what many startups do Z-Wave. They just need one perfect product they specialize on and then they can sell it into a very large commercial ecosystem. A most recent example is a small Dutch company doing outside colour lights with solar panels and Z-Wave.
Q: A lot of smart home experts feel like we are in the chasm between Early Adopters and Mass Market appeal. Do you agree with that opinion? If yes, what should manufacturers do to get out of it?
Dr. Paetz: That's true, not that much from the technology point of view but – as usual – from usability and use case point of view.
Q: Most homeowners struggle with the difficulty of a home automation set up. How do you think this will change in the near future?
Dr. Paetz: Smart Home is complex by definition. It's quite hard for a software to guess what users really want in a certain situation. There will be better interfaces such as voice etc but this will not eliminate the
fundamental problem of the variety of possible expectations.
Q: What are the benefits of a Z-Wave ecosystem compared to other wireless protocols?
Dr. Paetz: No doubt its the fact that it IS an ecosystem. There are other technologies, like Zigbee or Thread, just to mention too. But here there is no guaranteed interoperability. The end user can never know of devices work. As a result, they have to stick with one vendor. With Z-Wave there is a guaranteed interoperability that is monitored by the Alliance by a certification program. Once customers by a Z-Wave device they know that they can use with other vendors products and even do so 10 years from now.
Q: How would you describe Z-Wave to a person who's never heard of it before?
Dr. Paetz: Z-Wave is the idea that all electrical devices in a Home should work together and secure. This is done using a standardized wireless connection. Buy the Z-Wave devices you like from whoever makes them –
you can use them in your home together.
Q: What are your thoughts on the upcoming future of home automation?
Dr. Paetz: We see very strong growth in our segment doubling sales year over year. Of course, this growth rate will not sustain but the penetration rate will rise with better products, lower prices and better value propositions. I am still quite bullish on this market but of course, some dream scenarios communicated by large but inexperienced players in the market will not come true.
Q: A short fun question – Amazon Echo, Google Home or Apple HomeKit with Siri? or … Which is the best AI assistant for home automation?
Dr. Paetz: To be honest, I don't believe in the current stage of voice control for Smart Home.
Q: There are recent reports that Facebook is making a smart speaker to compete with the Echo/Google Home. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think the social network will have any chance of success?
Dr. Paetz: What I see is this unconditional belief in large brands. “Whatever Google touches turns into gold. Once google enters smart home this will change the game” Same for Apple. The reality in the market is that the
large companies are all active on one of the other way, but have not changed the smart home industry. Every industry creates its own champions. So for me it's not a no-brainier that a successful social media company is equally successful in smart home.
Q: Last, but not least, do you want to share something with our audience? Tips, insight, tricks or even something completely unrelated!
Dr. Paetz: Z-Wave is in this market for 13 years now and has sold over 50 Million devices. We have seen many companies and consortiums coming and leaving. if all the promises of some industry fellows would be true, this would be a different planet. hence, I would recommend: Don't listen to the “We will do” statements but ask for the “We have done” information.
Thank you a lot for your time and we look forward to the bright future of Z-Wave, the Z-Wave Alliance and home automation!
The National Security Hole at the Heart of the Trump Transition
Last year, I signed an anti-Donald Trump letter that circulated among national security types and made crystal clear, in numerous articles, my opinion of Trump's quasi-isolationist, protectionist campaign rhetoric. So I was not exactly waiting by the phone after the election for the transition to call and offer me some plum post.
I had, admittedly, briefly entertained the hope that, for the sake of the nation, Trump would let bygones be bygones and would call not on me but on other national security professionals for help, even those who opposed them during the campaign. If that were to happen, I suggested right after the election, other Never Trumpers should be willing to serve for the good of the nation. It was not to be, with the Washington Post reporting that Never Trump Republicans are being blacklisted by the transition team. Rumors of enemies lists are circulating, and some of the erstwhile Never Trumpers are said to be chagrined at their inclusion.
While Trump is making a mistake in not seeking out their political opponents — as Richard Nixon did when they appointed Nelson Rockefeller's loyalist, Henry Kissinger, as their national security advisor — Never Trumpers are also making a mistake if they cavil at not getting the call. There is nothing wrong with serving any president, even this one, but there is also an important role to be played by the loyal opposition, a principled voice to criticize Trump when they fall short of their ideals, which will be often, and to praise them on those occasions when they do something right.
The real problem is not Trump's failure to summon Never Trumpers to their administration. The problem is that they have not, so far, announced enough capable replacements for the 4,000 political appointments that any president must make.
Already one of their few national security appointments — would-be National Security Council (NSC) staffer Monica Crowley — has been forced out of the White House even before starting their job because of the plethora of plagiarism revelations that have come to light thanks to digging by CNN and others. Only a handful of other hires have been announced so far at the NSC, and the most prominent one is, of course, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the national security advisor who does not inspire confidence with their tweets promoting discredited conspiracy theories.
But the NSC is actually doing better on the hiring front than the other major organs of national security decision-making — the departments of State and Defense. Less than two full working days remain until the inauguration, yet few officials have been named at either department beyond the cabinet secretaries: James Mattis as secretary of defense, Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Mattis breezed through their confirmation hearings by breaking with the president-elect to defend NATO and criticize Vladimir Putin. Rex Tillerson had a rockier time of it, refusing, under Sen. Marco Rubio's skillful questioning, to criticize human rights abuses in Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines and also showing a lack of knowledge about numerous areas they were questioned about.
Even if Tillerson is confirmed — no sure thing for someone who once won an Order of Friendship from Putin — they and Mattis will have few other political appointees to support them as of this writing. Not even deputy secretaries have yet been appointed at the State or Defense departments, much less the crucial undersecretaries and assistant secretaries who are responsible for fleshing out the broad parameters of the administration's foreign policy. These are the obscure but important officials who do the real work of governing, teeing up the decisions that will be decided by the “principals” at NSC meetings and then translating policy guidance (which in this president's case is likely to be quite broad) into specific actions.
It is curious that, so far, the picks for most of those posts have not even been leaked, much less formally announced, especially given that a few ambassadors have already been appointed: Trump's bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman is bound for Tel Aviv (or is it Jerusalem?), business person William Hagerty for Tokyo, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad for Beijing. Yet ambassadors are not policymakers, and the people who are supposed to give them marching orders on a daily basis so far are MIA.
The Post's Josh Rogin reports that much of the delay at the Pentagon can be explained by clashes between Mattis and the transition team, with Mattis commendably wanting to recruit Never Trump Republicans or even non-Republicans like Michèle Flournoy — and the Trump partisans predictably balking. Tillerson also reportedly disagreed with some of the names floated by Team Trump for their deputy, including John Bolton, who may have been nixed by the president-elect in any case because of, believe it or not, their overly prominent mustache.
While Trump named cabinet members in a speedy fashion (in part, apparently, by not doing the full and necessary vetting), they are lagging behind in appointing lower-level officials compared with Obama in 2009. Even when appointees are chosen, the need for vetting and confirmation hearings could mean that it will be months before jobs are filled.
That's not a huge problem in the Department of Education, where policy decisions can be contemplated in a more leisurely fashion. It is potentially a big problem for national security jobs, whose occupants will have to deal with numerous crises, known and unforeseen, that can have the most serious repercussions for the security and prosperity of the entire country. Career officials can occupy those positions for the time being, but the consequence of that will be to freeze policymaking.
On second thought, given how curious some of Trump's instincts are (as they have just made clear again, they are anti-NATO, anti-EU, and pro-Putin), perhaps the incoming administration's inability to implement new policies for now will be a saving grace. But the policy vacuum cannot last indefinitely. While the president-elect certainly isn't obligated to appoint those who opposed them during the campaign, they are obligated to find high-quality people for crucial posts — and so far they haven't.

You can't get a Core i3 on Newegg right now for much less than $130 -- a sum that'll put you almost at the bottom of the Ivy Bridge league with a dual-core processor, 3MB cache and HD 2500 (i.e. not HD 4000) integrated graphics. That's why it's interesting to see these leaked AMD Trinity prices over at retailer BLT. If they're accurate, they indicate that the same amount of cash might afford a top-end Trinity A10 processor with overclockable 3.8GHz quad-cores, 4MB cache and vastly superior Radeon HD 7660D graphics. At the other end of AMD's range, a dual-core A4-5300 APU could cost as little as $60. The only catch we can see -- aside from the issue of accuracy -- is that by the time these processors actually become available rival Intel may well have seen fit to adjust its own prices. In fact, Chipzilla just launched some new Ivy Bridge processors over the weekend that brought the cost of entry down to $117 -- which goes to show that nothing stands still for long. Head past the break for some official gaming benchmark claims about the A10, or see More Coverage for extras.
The Channel Islands are home to four different subspecies of foxes that are found nowhere else in the world. Weighing just four to six pounds, the foxes are about 25% smaller those foxes found on the mainland. But in 1999, the foxes were facing extinction.
A distemper virus had caused the population on Catalina Island, which had numbered 1,300, to plummet all the way down to about 100. On the nearby islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz, the fox population was being decimated by bald eagles. Without a conservation effort, the fox would certainly die out. To combat the possibility, the Catalina Conservancy, among other groups, stepped in with a plan of "relocation, vaccinations, captive breeding and release, and wild fox population monitoring."
Another part of the effort was lowering the number of predatory golden eagles on the island. It was a two-pronged attack, one effort to capture and relocate the golden eagles (a protected species), and another to kill feral piglets that roamed the islands and initially attracted the eagles. This culling was not without controversy, and the basis of T.C. Boyle's novel When the Killing's Done.
But now, a mere 15 years after the effort began, the foxes may come off the endangered species list. One final study and discussion regarding their status has to take place before the final removal. If the removal is given the go ahead, it would mark the quickest recovery of an endangered animal species ever.
And now, for your enjoyment, some more photos of these cute, cute foxes!
Flickr / zcopley After spending all weekend absorbed in obscure forum postings about cryptography and digital signatures, and feeling a bit like the Javier Bardem character from the latest Bond film, I bought some Bitcoin on Monday and tweeted to my readers that I was excited to support such a technology and would continue to do so.
There are, it turns out, two factions within the Bitcoin (BTC) community: the "true believers" (as they are called) and the "speculators" (as the true believers call them). The speculators quietly slipped out of the room this afternoon to change their underwear as BTC's price in US dollars nosedived right before everyone's eyes. To make matters worse (or, quite possibly, the initial REASON for the panic), access to the major exchanges including Mt. Gox and BitFloor appeared to be under some form of heavy load or denial of service attack making customer access difficult—that would spook anyone.
The amount I have in BTC is insignificant, but it's these "insignificant" individual actions that when added up into the millions move markets and change our behavior. Google, for example, is not a company that makes most of its money from a handful of large institutional clients. Instead, it's the hundreds of millions of us searching—and occasionally clicking on a relevant ad or two—that feed the wise beast.
I don't know what motivated the speculators this week, aside from a combination of greed, boredom, and the tempting lure of easy returns. But after immersing myself in the BTC forums and community, I have a better understanding of what motivates the true believers:
1) Bitcoin is a vision of the future. It's a future where adults have control of their own money, and can send it anywhere in the world, even in the middle of the night... even on a weekend.
2) The true believers' dream is not that they are deep into the next Groupon-style money train before it pops, but rather that they are a part of a system that will enact massive global change—and incidentally make all early adopters astronomically rich. As someone on Twitter summarized it to me, "The beauty for true believers is that if bitcoin becomes THE major net currency, 1 BTC is a life changing amount."
Given the restricted number of BTC that will ever be in circulation, and the predicted loss of a certain number of coins over time (due to wallet file failures, forgetting encrypted private key passwords, etc), even owning one full BTC would command a staggering amount of purchasing power at some distant point in our Ridley Scott future where space mining is routine, we're all paid in universal credits—sorry, BTC—and the individual is more likely to be guided by pure capitalistic impulse rather than governmental decree.
3) Bitcoin is just the platform for what is yet to come. In other words, true believers hold that Bitcoin is not necessarily the killer app, it's merely the operating system. The recent media interest in BTC is sure to attract new app developers, tip widget designers, online casino companies, and even porn sites. The only thing between mass acceptance of BTC and what we have now is, well, being able to actually spend the stuff somewhere.
4) The end of credit card companies and politically connected fee-fed banks. To send a family member $10,000 in another country via PayPal would cost my recipient $200 to $399 in total fees. The same transaction over Bitcoin would cost 0.0005 BTC ($0.075 at current market price), and if my family member were to forget their Bitcoin public-facing address in the future, they could just create a new one with a single click.
So that's where the true believers are coming from. I think out of all these factors, if I were to begin using Bitcoin on a daily basis, I would want to see much better app development. It's the Wild West at the moment—lose your private key or find your wallet file corrupted, and you're out whatever money is in your account. I believe more consumer-friendly apps and services could be the welcome mat for the rest of us, giving a layer of comfort between ordinary user and Bitcoin's sharp, geeky edges.
Volkswagen is recalling 8.5 million vehicles across Europe in light of the company's ongoing diesel emissions scandal. The automaker hasn't yet announced full details yet, but in a statement, Volkswagen said repairs "will begin in January 2016 — at no cost to our customers." The recalled vehicles, including 2.4 million in Germany, contain "defeat devices" that optimize their engines to perform well during emissions testing. But out on the road, Volkswagen's diesel cars have been spewing far more toxic emissions than regulations allow and are in violation of laws like the US Clean Air Act. Some 11 million cars worldwide are affected by the scandal, and Volkswagen faces enormous fines and lawsuits globally as a result.
On Thursday, Germany's KBA automotive watchdog reportedly rejected Volkswagen's initial suggestion of a voluntary recall. Volkswagen then expanded the mandatory recall to cover all of its diesel fleet across Europe. Volkswagen has until the end of November to present German regulators with a plan for fixing the mess it's now embroiled in. In regards to a remedy for US Volkswagen owners, the company has said it's working on a more extensive fix that will comply with stricter emissions standards. The Environmental Protection Agency expects to hear about one such fix next week, but wants to test it directly before formally ordering a recall.
It's been almost two years since Canada Post announced its controversial plan to overhaul its operations, and the outcome of Monday's election may determine whether it will ever finish the job.
The NDP has said it will, if elected, tell Canada Post to reverse course on its plan to replace some home delivery with community mailboxes — the most contentious part of its five-point, five-year strategy — while the Tories say they stand by the changes which were announced, during their watch, in late 2013.
The Bloc Québécois and Greens also oppose the end of door-to-door and, like the NDP, have also come out against the postal service's plan to eliminate as many as 8,000 jobs.
The Liberals have been less clear on their position — more on them later.
Protests, at least one arrest, and even a jackhammer-wielding mayor have greeted Canada Post's efforts at reform. But a change in course now would be a mistake according to Walid Hejazi, a professor of international business at the University of Toronto.
Hejazi says Canada Post is "doing exactly the right thing," by putting more emphasis on parcel delivery while trimming delivery routes.
"The business case for delivering to the door is not there anymore," they told CBC News. "If [Canada Post] was a purely private company this is exactly what that company would do."
Royal Mail privatized
But politics tends to get in the way of postal reform.
U.S. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said as much in a recent speech in Washington; blaming politicians and unions for holding up efforts to turn around their troubled organization, which has been doing a slow-motion but spot-on impression of the Hindenburg as it struggles to adapt to a 21st century marketplace driven by parcels and e-commerce.
Protests and at least one arrest have greeted Canada Post's plan to phase out door-to-door delivery. (Jonah O'Neil - CNW Group/Canadian Union of Postal Workers) The U.S. Postal Service lost $26 billion over the past three years, Donahoe said, according to reports.
"What's holding us up? Myopia, shortsightedness," they said. "We never get past the narrow set of interests that are determined to preserve the status quo."
The U.S. has propped up its postal service while the U.K. has gone in the other direction and recently finalized the privatization of its similarly challenged Royal Mail, which has been carrying letters around the British Isles since 1516. It is led by former Canada Post CEO Moya Greene.
The sale, finalized earlier this month, brought in 3.3 billion pounds (just over $6.5 billion Cdn), though there were complaints the British government undervalued some of the shares that were first put on sale in 2013.
'Death spiral'
But one analyst says the route Canada Post has charted leads not to a bright future, but into a "death spiral" of higher prices and poorer service.
Benjamin Dachis, an analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute, says the five-point plan will send customers into the arms of Canada Post's competitors in the parcel sector while failing to address its cumbersome expenses.
Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has vowed to put a moratorium on Canada Post's plans, pending review, but stopped short of saying he'd call for an about-face. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press) "Reduced mail routes are going to help, but they still don't address the chronic issues … embedded in the labour costs," which were 71 per cent of Canada Post's total costs in 2011, they said, adding the Crown corporation is "just fiddling with the margins" by cutting routes and switching to community mailboxes.
Dachis penned a series of recommendations for reforming Canada Post in mid 2013. They wanted it to privatize pickup and delivery services — competition would keep a lid on labour costs — while keeping the core, organizational components public.
They also said Ottawa should subsidize rural postal services, which are more expensive to operate and are currently paid for by customers in urban markets.
The inevitable storm over privatization would surely dwarf the current argle-bargle over home delivery and job losses, but Dachis noted those involved are "going to have a public relations battle, one way or another."
Under the current plan, Canada Post is fighting with its customers, employees and cities. Their plan would have likely only been an issue with the employees, they say.
Given a pass?
What does all this mean for Canada Post's future? With some polls suggesting the Liberals are set to form a minority government, the picture is murky.
The Liberals have said they would put a moratorium on Canada Post's plan to cut home delivery, pending review, but have stopped short of saying they would call for an about-face.
But as Hejazi points out, a minority government means working with partners, which in this case would mostly likely be the NDP.
"I believe if the Liberals or Conservatives win and form the government [Canada Post] will be given a pass for the next number of years, which should be enough to complete their transformation," they said; which, in their view, is the right thing to do.
But if the Liberals ever need a favour from the NDP, it will presumably come at a price.
It's not hard to imagine NDP Leader Tom Mulcair sending their bill to Justin Trudeau through the mail.
The FP Power Map
Is it possible to identify the 500 most powerful individuals on the planet — one in 14 million? That's what we tried to do with the inaugural FP Power Map, our inventory of the people who control the commanding heights of the industries that run the world, from politics to high finance, media to energy, warfare to religion. Think of it as a list of all the most important other lists. Here's how they stack up — and why (sorry, declinists!) Americans are still No. 1 in pretty much everything that matters. For now.
Sources and Methods: Where possible, we took a “list of lists” approach, consulting the authoritative rankings for a given industry and substituting judgment where quantitative assessments do not exist.

...perpetuated by a unique 3D-pixelated art style, absurdly bright neons, obnoxious styling and robotic synthesizer sounds. It's the roaring 80's alright, with a dash of dystopia.
Synopsis
It's the 80's all over again. Only this time, the human race has more than an obnoxious pop culture to contend with.
With World War III nearing its demise, Earth only just begins to catch its breath when it is threatened by yet another menace. Unlike the preposterous mullets of its inhabitants however, this one's invisible – a parasitic organism capable of making hosts of unsuspecting human beings, consuming what's left of their souls and wreaking unfathomable havoc.
And it's spreading. With a vengeance.
Martial laws have been declared to make way for a global hunt, battle-hardened law enforcers have made allies of the most degenerate of criminals, while the rest of the world is paralysed with paranoia; yet who can be trusted? Who can see it, let alone destroy it? That's for them to worry about. For you are the enemy.
You are the organism with a mission. You are… HyperParasite.
Requirements
Minimum Requirements:
Labour's conference delegates meet in Liverpool in a couple of weeks with a sense of ethical purity after officials banned McDonald's from buying a stand to advertise itself as a good employer.
The national executive committee took the view that the burger chain's workers are among modern capitalism's losers and must be barred.
Jeremy Corbyn was clear: the young, the low paid and the under-represented locked into insecure employment are getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop. And he's right.
McDonald's workers are mainly young, are paid just above the minimum wage, lack union representation and are tied to zero-hours contracts. That ticks all four boxes.
The trouble is that although McDonald's might not be the most generous employer, it does take 16- and 17-year-olds when many wouldn't, and promotes them quickly. They move through the ranks in such a way that almost all trainee managers can say they started behind the counter. And it pays the government's living wage of £7.20 to 21-year-olds, when it could pay the minimum wage of £6.70.
Then there is the sad fact that most other companies operate without unions too. And many millennials don't appear to care, making the Labour leader's calls for greater union influence about as interesting to young people as the new Beatles film.
It's clear that zero-hours contracts can rarely be justified. All employers should be forced to offer a minimum number of hours when even the billionaire Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Directs, can promise to give shop staff a minimum of 12 hours' work a week.
No one should be forced to wait on tenterhooks to find out what hours the company rota has them working over the next week or month. And there's worse: the 160,000 workers in the care industry, many of them nurses, are effectively subsidising the public purse when they drive from one patient to the next; they are only paid for the time they actually spend with clients.
But for all their flaws, the contracts have their supporters, as shown by a survey last year that found workers using zero-hours contracts to be at least as happy as those on full-time arrangements. Some of these contented workers might even be in Liverpool, working for the security firm Labour has employed for the conference: Crawley-based OCS uses zero-hours contracts, though, it argues, only for one-off events.
The same problem applies to any discussion of young people in relation to housing. The young are not a class or a homogenous group, defeating the simplistic Corbynite view of the world.
Right-to-buy is a classic example. Tens of thousands of people in the lowest socioeconomic groups have cashed in on a 30-year property boom. Even though house prices have soared, their gain might be relatively modest. But they have a stake: and their home could easily be worth more than the £325,000 inheritance tax threshold. That's why George Osborne promised to raise the threshold on a couple's wealth to £1m by the end of the parliament. It's why housing associations are now under pressure to offload even more homes at a discount.
Another element of the property craze is the way many ordinary people have jumped on the buy-to-let bandwagon and built modest portfolios of homes for rent. And they will have felt vindicated after Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said recently that property was a better investment for retirement than a pension.
Is it any wonder that one of the Tory government's first acts was to push through a finance bill that cut the rate of capital gains tax? Since April the level of CGT that applies to property sales has dropped from 28% to 20%. Buy-to-letters have always been lightly taxed. Now it's a bad joke.
It would be easy to believe that this 1.4-million-strong group of rentiers are all baby boomers and that the average young McDonald's worker is light-years away from grabbing a slice of the action. But that would only be true if we failed to include the cascade of property wealth tumbling like a waterfall through the population. Homes are a cash machine for people during their working lives and a savings vehicle that often pays out to the next generation when they die. It's a disaster for the health of the economy, but a deeply embedded reality.
Pensions have also muddied the waters. While it is true that the younger generation is missing out on the bountiful final-salary schemes enjoyed by so many baby boomers, this cash is not just spent by the over-65s on Viking river cruises. Parents and grandparents are increasingly supplementing student incomes and paying for deposits on student flats – especially since Osborne relaxed the rules on access to retirement funds.
For Labour and those like myself who have campaigned on behalf of young people, the millennials' plight is obvious. But there needs to be a recognition that large sections of them have embraced the flexibility on offer from employers and that, in a wealthy economy like the UK, wealth extraction is an easier option than working in a PAYE job.
The Tories, for all their bluster about industrial strategy and rewarding work, are busy cutting the tax on wealth for a reason. For young and old alike, it is the lifeline they seek: and without a secure alternative, they are not going to give it up.
On this day in 1945, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt passes away after four momentous terms in office, leaving Vice President Harry S. Truman in charge of a country still fighting the Second World War and in possession of a weapon of unprecedented and terrifying power.
On a clear spring day at their Warm Springs, Georgia, retreat, Roosevelt sat in the living room with Lucy Mercer (with whom they had resumed an extramarital affair), two cousins and their dog Fala, while the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff painted their portrait. According to presidential biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, it was about 1 p.m. that the president suddenly complained of a terrific pain in the back of my head and collapsed unconscious. One of the women summoned a doctor, who immediately recognized the symptoms of a massive cerebral hemorrhage and gave the president a shot of adrenaline into the heart in a vain attempt to revive him. Mercer and Shoumatoff quickly left the house, expecting FDR's family to arrive as soon as word got out. Another doctor phoned first lady Eleanor Roosevelt in Washington D.C., informing them that FDR had fainted. They told the doctor they would travel to Georgia that evening after a scheduled speaking engagement. By 3:30 p.m., though, doctors in Warm Springs had pronounced the president dead.

Eleanor delivered their speech that afternoon and was listening to a piano performance when they were summoned back to the White House. In their memoirs, they recalled that ride to the White House as one of dread, as they knew in their heart that their husband had died. Once in their sitting room, aides told them of the president's death. The couple's daughter Anna arrived and the women changed into black dresses. Eleanor then phoned their four sons, who were all on active military duty. At 5:30 pm, they greeted Vice President Harry Truman, who had not yet been told the news. A calm and quiet Eleanor said, “Harry, the president is dead.” They asked if there was anything they could do for her, to which they replied, “Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.”

Indeed, Truman had rather large shoes to fill. FDR had presided over the Great Depression and most World War II, leaving an indelible stamp on American politics for several decades. They also left Truman with the difficult decision of whether or not to continue to develop and, ultimately, use the atomic bomb. Shockingly, FDR had kept their vice president in the dark about the bomb's development and it was not until Roosevelt died that Truman learned of the Manhattan Project. It was also not until FDR died that Eleanor learned of their husband's renewed affair with Lucy Mercer.
Eleanor, in their own words, was trained to put personal things in the background. They swallowed the shock and anger about Mercer and threw themselves into FDR's funeral preparations. Thousands of Americans lined the tracks to bid Roosevelt farewell while a slow train carried their coffin from Warm Springs to Washington, D.C. After a solemn state funeral, they were buried at their family's home in Hyde Park, New York.
The Bengals have four defensive ends currently on the roster and outside of starters Carlos Dunlap and Michael Johnson, the depth is shaky and unreliable at best with Margus Hunt and Will Clarke in the wings. The Bengals have six days until the regular-season opened and are still in a position to try to improve their defensive end depth, although the options available at this point aren't all that impressive.
Dunlap and Johnson are a great combination, there's no doubt about that. My issue, and many fellow fans' issue, is that there's not even an average player behind them and the team is responsible for that lack of depth. They are apparently handing the left end/nickel tackle role that Wallace Gilberry played for the last few seasons to the almost 30-year old Margus Hunt, who, again, has failed to show they can be a quality player in this league during the regular season.
With Clarke set to get more chances at right end, as they were supposed to be Johnson's long-term replacement, Hunt is the only other defensive end in the roster. They also look like they will get away with the nickel tackle job in spite of having a better player in DeShawn Williams, who has been one of the nicest surprises this preseason. Marcus Hardison is lost to injury, and Ryan Brown, the rookie undrafted free agent was never considered to be real competition for the position. They have joined the practice squad though.
It's not that Hunt is bad, though, he's already too old to have any kind of upside, but they haven't shown enough to say they can be that third pass rusher the Bengals are counting on as contenders. For a defense that relies so much on its front four to get to the quarterback, it is frustrating to see no real interest in bringing more quality pass rushers to a roster that already lost Gilberry in free agency, without much if any fight.
To be fair the Bengals brought in Dwight Freeney, but they failed to sign them and the veteran now plays for the Falcons. Other than that, they've just stayed the course with Hunt. A couple of days ago, I wrote an article about how stability works for Cincinnati, but also mentioned how in situations, like with Hunt, it hasn't panned out at all.
After using a second-round pick in the big Estonian, I understand that the team has tried to give them a fair chance in previous seasons, but this is already their fourth year in the NFL and he's just another guy out there.
Not ideal when a TE does that to your DE https://t.co/ohi5GFAgHz — Ryan Patrick (@RoyleRedlegs) September 2, 2016
Injuries have taken a toll for Cincinnati at defensive tackle as they've lost rookie Andrew Billings as well as Brandon Thompson and Hardison inside, but that hasn't been the case outside and they're the only ones to blame for failing to bring in any competition for Hunt. I'm fine with Clarke because he's still younger and has looked better this summer. He's never been a pass rusher and the team doesn't consider them as one, but the backup left end role does concern me badly.
I know the Bengals' philosophy is to develop their own players and to give them the spot after another guy leaves, but they've also brought somebody like Karlos Dansby in to shore up the linebacker unit and they could have done the same at defensive end, no matter what happened with Freeney.
For waiting too long to take action, the Bengals face the risk of not finding anybody worthy and not finding someone who has the time to learn the defense and practice with the team.
Last year the Bengals still had Gilberry and they also added Chris Carter as situational pass rusher, but so far the scenario is way worse in 2016 with less depth to back up the starters. The market is also very tiny even after the final cuts.
Here are some of the best defensive ends available.
- Ryan Davis: They originally made the Jaguars team in 2012 as an undrafted free agent and had 11 sacks over four seasons before being moved to linebacker by Jacksonville in the offseason.
- Corey Lemonier: A 3-4 outside linebacker, Lemonier was a third-round pick by the 49ers in 2013, but hasn't recorded a sack since their rookie season. Maybe a change of formation and a smaller role can help them find their niche.
- O'Brien Schofield: A hot name after leaving the Falcons, Schofield was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft and played for them for three seasons. They then joined the Seahawks for two years and the Falcons last year.
- Björn Werner: the German former first-round pick with the Colts failed to impress as a 3-4 outside linebacker, and was cut by the Jaguars recently, but they were a pretty good 4-3 end in college and has some upside.
- Quinton Coples: a surprising cut by the Rams, Coples is a former first-round pick as well. At 6-foot-6 they could be a very intriguing addition and they were tried at tackle in Los Angeles in addition to end.
Head coach Marvin Lewis indicated he's open to exploring ways to improve the 53-man roster, so hopefully the Bengals finally address the most glaring hole they have after ignoring it during the entire offseason.
A first-half brace from Kazaiah Sterling did the trick as our Under-18s won 2-1 at Swansea City in the Barclays Under-18 Premier League on Saturday (February 6).
The frontman was to the fore as we stormed out of the blocks at the Swans' Landore Training Ground and took a two-goal lead inside 20 minutes.
The hosts did manage to pull a goal back with just under a quarter-of-an-hour left, but we saw out the closing stages to complete a well-earned victory.
After an overnight stay in south Wales we came out firing on all cylinders and grabbed the lead just two minutes in, Sterling combining well with Jack Roles before finishing well past Swansea goalkeeper Lewis Thomas.
It could have been 2-0 moments later but Marcus Edwards volleyed wide, with midfield colleague Dylan Duncan also seeing a couple of chances go begging – the first going into the side netting and the second flying over the top – as we kept the pressure on.
Thomas made a couple of important stops, but they could do nothing to keep out Sterling's effort on 20 minutes. Joe Muscatt's cross from the right was headed down by Duncan and Sterling duly doubled their tally from inside the box.
Liam Cullen saw a shot blocked for Swansea, but we went in at half-time deservedly ahead.
The second period was a tighter affair and the home side almost pulled a goal back straight after the restart when substitute Jordan Garrick raced through, but goalkeeper Tom McDermott was equal to their effort.
Keanan Bennetts was denied by Thomas on the hour mark before McDermott intervened once more, diving to tip Cullen's header behind.
Edwards shot over for us before Swansea's Aaron Lewis made it 2-1 in the 76th minute with a 22-yard free-kick which went up and over the wall before dipping into the corner.
However, we stayed strong at the back to ensure we held onto our advantage until full-time.
Spurs U18s: McDermott, Muscatt, Tsaroulla, Owens, Mukena, Maghoma (c), Edwards, Roles (Marsh 72), Sterling (Loft 61), Duncan, Bennetts (Tracey 61). Substitute (not used): Whiteman (GK).

Elsewhere, Samuel Shashoua scored for England Under-17s as they drew 1-1 with Portugal in their first game at the Algarve Tournament on Friday (February 5). Samuel, who started for the Young Lions alongside club team-mates Japhet Tanganga and Jaden Brown, struck early in the second half to secure a share of the spoils for their side. England next take on Germany on Sunday afternoon.
It is not often we come across people making kind gestures, especially to the underprivileged. But there are some, who know nothing but to be kind, nothing but to be generous. And for them, karma is just, and mostly instant.
Here's a story of a man, who's name hasn't been disclosed, who encountered instant karma. The story originally written in Malayalam, and posted to a public group on Facebook by the name Right Thinkers, has by now got over 1190 shares. Here's the story, cut short.
A man entered Hotel Sabrina, run by C Narayanan, in Malappuram in Kerala for dinner, after an all day-long meeting, and placed their order. As their order arrived, the man noticed a pair of small eyes, outside the window, wistfully looking at the food served at various tables.
A little ragpicker.
Man gestured the little boy to come in, and they came in with their little sister. They asked them what they'd like to have and the boy pointed at the plate on their table. They ordered another plate.
When the food was served, the little boy couldn't contain their excitement. Just before they started, their sister held their hand, stopping him. They understood they want them both to wash their hands before starting.
The kids quietly finished the food ordered for them. Neither did they speak to each other, or smile. When done, they rose, looked at the man, washed their hands and left. The man hadn't touched their food yet. They felt full.
They finished their meal and called for the bill. When they got back to the table after washing their hands, they saw the bill and it moved them to tears they had been holding back all this while.
The bill had no amount, but a message for him.
It read, "We don't have a machine that can bill humanity. May good happen to you."
We published the above story this morning, and by evening, it has gone viral, and we were able to trace the unnamed man, our hero in the story.
Meet Akhilesh Kumar, working as a senior technical sales engineer at Power Solution Industries LLC, in Dubai. This was an incident that happened when they were on a short trip to their hometown.

They had written the original post on January 6, in the form of a short story. We also had a conversation with a representative of Hotel Sabrina, but couldn't figure out the generous person at the bill counter who made the heartwarming gesture.
Maybe because generosity could claim their job.
Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors Inc., speaks during a news conference at the Nevada State Capitol building in Carson City, Nevada, U.S., on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2014.

No one has been to Mars yet, and Elon Musk wants to change that in a big way. The SpaceX CEO says we need to put a million people on the Red Planet to make sure human civilization survives.
"I think there is a strong humanitarian argument for making life multi-planetary... in order to safeguard the existence of humanity in the event that something catastrophic were to happen," Musk said in a recent interview with the digital magazine Aeon.
Musk's comment sounds ominous but may not be off the mark, given the threats that scientists see in climate change and space rocks.
Just what would it take to move so many people to Mars?
"Excluding organic growth, if you could take 100 people at a time, you would need 10,000 trips to get to a million people," Musk told Aeon. "But you would also need a lot of cargo to support those people. In fact, your cargo to person ratio is going to be quite high. It would probably be 10 cargo trips for every human trip, so more like 100,000 trips. And we're talking 100,000 trips of a giant spaceship."
This isn't the first time Musk has made a pitch for colonizing Mars. At the AllThingsD's 2013 conference last year, Musk said, "Either we spread Earth to other planets, or we risk going extinct... An extinction event is inevitable and we're increasingly doing ourselves in."
Got it.
It isn't every day you go from your small West London town to recording in the studio with one of the brightest stars from Atlanta. For 23-year-old singer Melissa Sarah Griffiths, better known as Millie Go Lightly, a coincidence with a shared beat landed them on Young Thug's “singing album,” Beautiful Thugger Girls.
When working with a star who shines as bright as Thug it isn't easy to showcase your own light. This is especially true when you're a relatively unknown artist appearing on one of the most anticipated rap projects of the year. On June 16, fans will get to decide if Thug and Millie have the type of chemistry it takes to quiet a sea of doubters, skeptical of everything ranging from Thug's commercial viability to their ability to pull off a country song.
Over the phone, Millie told Complex how they got their start in music, what it's like to work with Young Thug, and their plans for the future.
You can download Beautiful Thugger Girls now on iTunes or stream it on Apple Music.
How did you first get into music?
I started singing when I was about six or seven. Then one day my mum heard me singing Whitney Houston and decided that they thought I was ok at it. It's like all kids went to stage classes that kids go to, drama classes on the weekend and I just really loved it. Then I started to write my own songs at fourteen and play the guitar.

How did “Family Don't Matter” come together?
I had been doing some work with Wheezy who works with Thug. We basically both ended up with the same beat from Wheezy completely accidentally. It was a real serendipitous event. We had no idea.
I wrote a song called “Medicine” to that beat. Somebody in Thug's team was like “let me hear Millie's music because I've never heard it.” They've met me a million times, but half had never heard my music. They pull up the private link I had been sharing around the group. The first song was “Medicine.” They were like “oh my god that's the beat.” We realized we both had written a song on the same beat. Then they called me on Saturday because they wanted to use it for the album.
So we basically ended up splitting the song down the middle. He's got half and I have half. Then they wrote parts that they wanted me to sing. It was weird, because they had me in mind for that song any way to sing the hook. So when they found out I had written a song to it, they allowed me to put my verses on it too, which was so nice of him. They didn't have to do that.

They had written it for him, they're relevant to him, the words. They had me in mind to sing it. They were so patient with me. Went through everything line by line. Explained everything in adequate detail. Obviously, some of the things that he's going to say are not things that are going to pop into my head. He's Young Thug. It took me a couple of times to get it right though. They would stop me and correct me.
What was the chemistry with Thug like?
Their manager described it as like brother and sister. Immediately the chemistry was there. Sometimes it isn't there to be honest when you work with people. I was so fortunate that they were so patient. I wasn't expected them too, but they ended up singing my part as well on the end, which was crazy. To hear them singing my lyrics as well was just unbelievable.

How did the second song come about?
The first night I went into the studio we didn't work on “Family Don't Matter.” I just played them what I had done. I was so tired, and they said “There's another song that I want you to do. I've written it. All you need to do is sing it.” I said OK. Obviously, we had to adjust a few of the lyrics to make them a little more suitable for someone like me to sing them.
They were great. They think on the spot; he's so ad hoc. They just adjusts everything. They said “Millie this is what I want you to say.” I went in there and did that. Then they said “What do you want to do now?” I said I'll do a couple of backing vocals, a couple of adlibs, I'll do your parts and then they said “Now I'd like you to sing the second verse and this is how I want you to sing it.” And by that point I could tell he's so meticulous. He's a perfectionist. Where as before I was like I'll sing the whole thing. I said to the engineer “No let's do it line by line. I need to get it exactly how Jeff sings it.” So I can match the vocal exactly. He'll pick up on it. There's no point. I'll come out and he'll be like “Millie go back in.”

Besides working with Thug you've also featured on P-Lo's latest album. How did that come about?
We met online. I recorded my vocals in the living room here (her mom's house in London) for their album and sent them over. We met for the first time in London when they came over Kehlani's tour. So we had actually done the song and the album was processing by the time I met them in real life. We met them again when I was working with Wheezy.
Do you approach a track differently for a trap artist like Thug versus a very Bay influenced artist like P-Lo?
First thing is you have to do your research. So you have to listen to back catalog. I watched a lot of their music videos. Just educate yourself on the artist. Then P-Lo I just said “What do you want it to be about? What do you think I can bring to the project that's different?” Because they could have picked anyone to do it, so I wanted them to instruct me on what they wanted the content to be. So they would send me piano loops then I came up with the “Hennessy, galaxy” hook. So in essence, they always say to me when they work with me it's just like doing a remix. He'll send me piano chords. I'll just do the vocal and send it back. Then they remix it into the track.

With Thug that was totally different, because we had already written two songs. Then bringing it together, then them teaching me what they wanted me to say for the first part of the song.
You've been working with Wheezy who produces for Thug, do you have music coming out with him?
Yes, I do. Wheezy and I first met in December. We did a couple of tracks together. It was almost like a test run, because they didn't know me. I'm this unknown girl from England. They must've been like “What the hell is this?”
POST CONTINUES BELOW
I really have a lot of respect for them and a lot of time for him. I think he's so talented. He's a really nice guy. We did another three songs about two weeks ago. That will be on the project that I'm putting together. I've been making music for years and years. This past year working with Wheezy, working with 808 Mafia, working with London On Da Track it's obviously brought me to a whole other level.
How does it feel coming from a small town in the UK working with an artist like Thug or producers like Wheezy and London On Da Track?
When I was working with Wheezy the second time when I went into the vocal booth I took a minute to look around, because I have my friends Snapchatting me from their desk at work. I can't think about it when I'm in it, because if I think about it when I'm in if it's distracting. It's when I come home to my normal life it's like it never really happened.
It's not normal is it? It's like a lightning bolt hitting you. That's how it feels. It's a one in a million chance of an artist that you've listened to for years and years and then to be...it's such an honor. He's a true musician. People don't realize, but he's so meticulous. He's so hardworking. He's so professional. To be in a working environment at this stage in my career with someone like that is really humbling.

The only way to describe them is a genius, their knowledge of vocabulary, the manipulation of words, even how they use their voice. Me and my boyfriend were sitting there, like, how are they doing this? You just don't know where it comes from. It's unbelievable to watch. It really is.
What's one thing you hope people will take away from your music?
I think I want people to take away that looks can be deceiving. I'm nothing like the music I make. It's a part of me, but it's not what I'm like all the time. I don't think people will expect Thug to have done a collaboration with somebody like me. I think people can take away from it if it's what you really want to do, do it.
What does it feel like knowing your dreams are almost coming to fruition?
I visualized this as my life, my whole life. So now that it's coming to be, that it's close, it feels like a natural process. I got a degree in Latin. My mom is still hoping I go to law school. It could have been a totally different outcome for me. It's what I always wanted. I pictured it every day. I still do.

Here are two competing theories of how the coming transportation revolution could impact American life.
One possibility is that easy mobility—driverless cars, on-demand deliveries, and the like—will dull the pains of suburban life. The long commute, the wasted driving time, the difficulty of running out for a carton of milk—the inconvenience and expense of the subdivision will be melted away by hot new technology. Milk by drone, what a concept!
Another is that easy mobility produces greater advantages in the city. Carless living is better than ever. NIMBY battles don't happen because parking and congestion aren't problems. Wasted auto infrastructure, like lots and curbside parking and garages, is converted towards better uses like housing and restaurants. Maybe a central highway, once evidence of a city's essential unpleasantness, becomes a park.
Those two futures might both exist, but is it possible that the technology could push Americans away from the suburban status quo? Or it is the opposite? Will freedom from driving allow us to live closer together, or permit us to live further away? Consider the question a loose societal analogy to Clayton Christiensen's business dichotomy of disruptive versus sustaining innovation. Does the transportation revolution sustain American sprawl or disrupt it?
Two op-eds published Thursday make the case one way and the other for the driverless car and the American settlement. In Bloomberg View, the economist Tyler Cowen argues that new technology—not just cars, but also virtual reality and the Internet of Things—has advantages that favor the suburbs. In the Wall Street Journal, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick posits that new technology will create “a more livable and less congested” city.
Cohen's argument is in some ways convincing. He's right that driverless cars and on-demand delivery could bring perks to the suburbs—a commute spent reading a book, say, or the quick purchase of that one-percent pint—that have traditionally belonged to urbanites. It's also true that new technologies, like a smart home heating system, are more readily installed in the modern, spacious suburban home than the older urban apartment. (Ask a New Yorker if she's ever had a garbage disposal.)
But how much weight do these inventions put on the scale? The services that Cowen awaits at their Virginia home will still be subject to the same low-density distribution costs that have restrained taxis from roaming suburban streets, and currently limit Amazon from offering two-hour delivery beyond cities. Even with drones, greater distances will keep delivery marginally less efficient, slower and more expensive.
Futurists have been peddling some iteration of the “death of distance” theory—the idea that tech is making proximity irrelevant—since the invention of the telephone. Yet people are still drawn to work, eat and socialize in company. Videoconferencing hasn't killed the office; online universities haven't discouraged kids from shipping off to college.
Kalanick, meanwhile, is at the helm of a company that has infiltrated virtually every possible mode of mobility: long-distance trucking, package delivery, food delivery, and of course, personal travel in shared and/or autonomous cars. They and their peers have striking visions for what a city freed from private automobile ownership might be capable of.
Lyft President John Zimmer envisioned such a city in a post on Medium earlier this month. Imagine a world (in your best movie trailer voice), “A world where we need less parking — where streets can be narrowed and sidewalks widened. It's a world where we can construct new housing and small businesses on parking lots across the country — or turn them into green spaces and parks. That's a world built around people, not cars.”
We at Slate are frankly intrigued by the possibility that autonomous vehicles might have such an effect, and we'll be dedicating a Futurography segment to ownership next month that will have a cool video on this future city.
But Kalanick makes a great point in their piece: autonomous transportation is actually the less important component in creating “a city that lives and breathes more easily.” The more important concept is… sharing. Not the bullshit low-paid menial labor that has long characterized the sharing economy, but actual sharing, where two people get in the same car together.
The most radical future is one where self-driving cars are shared, both on a single trip and between trips. A slightly less radical future is one in which individuals are willing to use a car someone else has just used, but prefer to ride alone.
But what if most people want their own autonomous car, all the time—a car in which you can leave your suitcase while you have lunch, where there is no camera watching because nobody uses it but you, where the air freshener and the radio station are the ones you chose? That, as Clive Thompson pointed out in Mother Jones, would hardly produce the de-congested, parkified city of the future. That's more of a Cowen future than a Kalanick future. That's a future basically recognizable as our present, albeit with higher car payments, more traffic, and more time to watch TV on the way to work.
Some companies, like Uber and Lyft, are interested in selling rides. They will want to keep their fleets as small as possible, because cars cost their companies money, and rides produce it. A model where people share rides would be generally preferable, because a high customer-to-inventory ratio would be better. A denser population will be a more efficient market for them.
But what about the companies that build autonomous cars? They will want to sell as many as possible. Whether that's to individual owners or to collectivized fleets, well, who knows? But either way, sharing isn't good for their business model. When have we ever shared something when it has been feasible for each of us to have one of our own?
Regulation could be one way to tip the scale towards sharing or away from it; towards the urban-utopia model and away from the suburban pattern of today. But another factor will simply be consumer choice: How much is it worth to have a car of one's own, an extra space that belongs to you, that smells like you? How much is it worth to ride across town alone, in silence? How much does it cost us if that's what everyone wants?

The Spanish tax agency has sent a new report to the judge investigating the Gürtel kickbacks-for-contracts graft case that worsen the charges against former Popular Party treasurer Luis Bárcenas even further.
The report reveals that Bárcenas, whom Judge Pablo Ruz is due to question on Thursday, has more accounts in different countries than those declared up to now.
The discovery not only renders void the 2012 fiscal amnesty in which they sought refuge — as it was done with untrue figures — but also means the scope of the financial fraud they may have committed is now double that previously estimated.
The National Fraud Investigation Office document, compiled after analyzing figures from the most recent request for information from the Swiss authorities, suggests that Bárcenas has accounts in the United States, the Bahamas and Uruguay, in addition to those already discovered in Switzerland, where they accumulated 47 million euros.
The Finance Ministry is carrying out a detailed analysis of Bárcenas's relationship with Swiss bank Lombard Odier. The PP's former moneyman visited the bank on 33 occasions between 2003 and 2008 to deposit wads of banknotes — totaling between 30,000 and 300,000 euros each time — that reached a sum of 4.174 million euros.
The visits tally with others they made to the Dresdner Bank in Switzerland, which they visited 35 times between 2000 and 2008, depositing sums of between 20,000 and 240,000 euros on each occasion for a total of 4.102 million.
Twenty-two cricketers will subject their skills and temperament to the toughest of tests; equally, fans in both countries will be on trial

Fresh from their match-winning performance against Australia in the quarter-final, Yuvraj Singh inevitably found themselves confronted with questions about the semi-final against Pakistan. "No point saying it will be a normal match," Yuvraj said. "You all expect us to win, the whole country expects us to win. We are doing the best we can and leaving the rest to God."
It's impossible not to feel for the players, all 22 of them. It is no point pretending that this is just another match. It is the semi-final of the World Cup. And it's between India and Pakistan. Between them, there has been Partition. Three wars. Suspicion. Animosity. Kashmir.
Also diplomacy. Politics. Attempted reconciliation. Cricket can never expect to fully free itself of the web of history. And though it is a huge and unfair burden that the cricketers carry, it is their reality.
But there is another way of looking at India and Pakistan. No two cricket nations have so much in common. There is the language and culture. Food. A shared passion for films and music. So much so that when an Indian or Pakistani lands either in Delhi or Lahore, it feels just like home. And Indian and Pakistani cricketers are friendlier with each other than they are with players from any other country. It's a natural kinship shared among them, perhaps reinforced by empathy. Look at this photograph of Shahid Afridi and MS Dhoni: it's hard to picture any other pair of captains presenting a picture of such warmth and comradeship.
I remember a conversation I had with Younis Khan, then captain of Pakistan, a couple of days after their team had beaten India in a Champions Trophy match in Pretoria in 2009. Younis spoke of chiding a couple of Indian television journalists who'd been chasing them for a quote that would damn Dhoni. "Why are you after Dhoni?" they asked them. "Winning and losing, it keeps happening. Today it is their turn, tomorrow it could be mine."
Younis wasn't being prescient, just real. A couple of days later they found themselves before the firing squad, answering questions about match-fixing after having dropped a simple catch off Grant Elliot in the semi-final against New Zealand. Elliot went on to play a match-winning innings. Younis was playing with a broken finger. "A few days ago I took a catch and effected a run-out and I was praised for playing with a broken finger,'' they said. Some questioned their wisdom of playing with an injury, but had they pulled out, they would surely been accused of abdicating their responsibility to the country.
Sport is inextricably linked to national identity. Which isn't a bad thing by itself, because sport for the most part is a feel-good, positive force. It makes fans appreciate skills and beauty, the thrill of competition and of overcoming odds. But being a sports fan is as much about joy as it is about pain. It's part of the deal. For every winner there must be a loser. In fact, victory would never feel so thrilling without the experience of loss.
India v Pakistan will be a test for the fans as well as the players © AFP
All sports, wrote Simon Barnes in The Meaning of Sport, "represent the collision of wills: people or teams who want the same thing and have to cause somebody pain in order to get it". It is easy, if you so choose, to find in this a metaphor for warfare, but the beauty of sport is that people rarely die playing it. Sportsmen compete fiercely and proudly, exhausting themselves mentally and physically in the pursuit of victory, and then the victor and vanquished walk off the field, shaking each other's hand, and often with the knowledge that no victory or loss is final. They will compete again tomorrow and there will be another shot at redemption. That is the essence of sport.
Partisanship is fundamental to fandom. It is the bedrock of sport. Without it sport would be reduced to a mere spectacle, devoid of its emotional core. By the same token, triumphalism is its biggest bane. Allied with nationalism, it presents the ugly face of sport. It blinds fans to the very spirit of competition between athletes.
Twenty-two cricketers will subject their skills and temperament to the toughest of tests tomorrow. Equally, the fans in both the nations will be on trial too.
Very few expected Pakistan to go so far so smoothly in this World Cup. Only a month ago their team lay in tatters following the spot-fixing verdict. Irrespective of what happens in Mohali, their performance in the World Cup is worthy of celebration. Indian fans never forget to remind the world that their team has not lost to Pakistan in a World Cup match. That is an impressive record. But it's not a run that can last forever. Nothing in life is permanent.
Fans should feel grateful the tournament has produced a semi-final that feels like a final. It is also appropriate that the match is taking place in Punjab. Mohali is a small town, lacking the facilities and space for such a high-profile match, but there couldn't have been a more perfect place, geographically and culturally, for a World Cup match between these two rivals.
Punjabiyat is the biggest common theme between these nations, and the spirit of hospitality is the defining characteristic of the Punjabi culture on both sides of the border. It has become a cliché now, but travelling to Pakistan during India's landmark tour of 2004 provided me with some of the most moving and uplifting experiences of my life. It was, and will remain, one of the greatest examples of how sport - and in the subcontinent that means cricket - can be a beacon for goodwill and fellow feeling.
And after the fans have spent themselves in cheering their teams, irrespective of the result, they will do well to evoke the spirit of Chennai in 1999 or Karachi in 2004. After their teams had lost emotionally draining encounters, the fans rose to make their sport, and nations, proud.
On the field tomorrow there is the opportunity for one team to take the penultimate step towards cricket's biggest prize. For Pakistan, for all its troubles inside and outside the game, a World Cup win will be the tonic that the nation needs. For Indians, above everything else, it will be the perfect gift for their most-adored sport hero. But a bigger opportunity lies beyond the boundary. To revel in victory is the greatest reward for the sports fan, but nothing dignifies the sport more than grace in defeat.

Kim Dotcom's foray into the tiny and normally rather placid world of New Zealand politics brought global interest to the South Pacific nation's recent election – culminating with the involvement of other outside heavyweights, including NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Ultimately the über-wealthy German immigrant went head to head with the country's prime minister – and lost. Dotcom ended up failing spectacularly – describing themselves as political “poison.” Their Internet Mana alliance, personally bankrolled by Dotcom to the tune of nearly NZ$5 million ($3.9 million), failed to win a single seat in New Zealand's 120-seat parliament in elections held on September 20.
Outwardly, Kim Dotcom's Internet Party campaigned against mass surveillance and for free tertiary education and marijuana law reform. But by the end, New Zealand voters saw through the party – officially registered only in May this year – and deemed it a vanity project designed only to win Dotcom enough political support to hold the balance of power under the country's proportional voting system and veto their extradition to the U.S. An unusual alliance with Mana, a leftist party advocating for the interests of New Zealand's underprivileged indigenous Maori, seemed like a bold tactical move on paper, but was a disaster in practice. Dotcom's flamboyant lifestyle and seemingly limitless cash ended up destroying Mana's credibility of standing up for the downtrodden.
Dotcom, who moved to New Zealand in 2010, rose to prominence in the small island nation through an unusually lavish lifestyle and a habit for splashing cash amongst the country's elite. The German shelled out NZ$500,000 to sponsor fireworks welcoming in 2011 in New Zealand's biggest city, Auckland. And they gave $NZ50,000 to high-profile Auckland mayoral candidate John Banks – a donation that later became the subject of intense scrutiny after it was revealed Banks, later a key government minister, had illegally declared it as anonymous. Dotcom, offended by Banks' refusal to acknowledge their generosity, later testified against them in court. Banks lost.
The need to win powerful friends became particularly evident to Dotcom after the Hollywood-style raid of their luxurious mansion north of Auckland in January 2012. The raid, carried out by New Zealand police with the help of FBI agents, saw Dotcom arrested on copyright and racketeering charges – and facing extradition to the U.S. Released on bail, Dotcom mounted a none-too-subtle public relations campaign to win sympathy with the New Zealand public – including hosting “Swim with Kim” pool-parties at their home and recording several pieces of original music, such as a song poking fun at John Banks. For New Zealanders with a soft spot for an underdog, Dotcom was the perfect puckish rogue.
Initially, New Zealanders seemed curious about the “man everyone wants,” as they were announced at their election rallies. Dotcom's personal celebrity and charisma shook up election year, in a country where successful politicians typically pride themselves on a managerial style more characteristic of bank managers. Dotcom's non-conformist attitude became apparent when the Internet Party took politics into nightclubs with a series of “party parties.” Attracted by the music and eager to meet and take a selfie with Dotcom himself, young New Zealand voters flocked to the country's nightlife venues.
Ironically, it was one of these dance parties that laid the ground for Kim Dotcom's downfall. Dotcom led party-goers in a repeated chant against the country's center-right prime minister, John Key. A video of the “f**k John Key” chant was uploaded to the official YouTube account for Internet Mana and widely circulated through social media. But many New Zealand voters appeared disgusted by the negative campaigning against an enormously popular incumbent. Since 2008, Key had leveraged their down-home image and their disarming, self-deprecating sense of humor to steer New Zealand through tough economic times and the destruction caused by two major earthquakes. Key's personal popularity with centrist voters was such that it came as no surprise to watchers when their National Party mounted a presidential-style re-election campaign, using the slogan “Team Key.” Against Key's “nice guy” image, the abuse being hurled by Dotcom seemed jarring.
And there were other examples of nastiness: a “burning effigy” of John Key, never formally linked to Internet Mana, was frequently cited by the prime minister as evidence of Dotcom's unsavory tactics, along with apparent death threats. Dotcom also clashed with their own Internet Party leader, Laila Harre, after they tweeted a “joke” about killing a prostitute. And at Internet Mana's campaign launch in August, a party press secretary angrily called a journalist a “puffed up little sh*t” – an outburst which led that night's television news bulletins.
Not all the blame for the failure of Internet Mana can be laid at Dotcom's door. It was never clear how the joint venture between Hone Harawira's Mana, a far-left party based around improving the lot of disadvantaged Maori, and Kim Dotcom's Internet Party, which had been targeting educated, urban and predominantly white voters, fitted together. By the election, the purple branding and original startup feel of the Internet Party – which let members determine policy via a Reddit-style online platform – had all but been subsumed by the hard-left Mana, at the behest of Harawira. The result was a strange mix of Maori nationalism, sprinkled with old style socialism and pictures of children clutching iPads.
But in the end, Internet Mana's fortunes rose and fell with those of Kim Dotcom. By the time their much touted “Moment of Truth” public meeting took place on September 15, five days before the election, most voters had grown tired of what seemed like a sideshow. The cast of foreigners – including U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald, as well as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden – revealed a host of eye-popping claims about New Zealand's role in international spying, through the “Five Eyes” alliance with the United States. But for most voters, their presence only served to underline Dotcom's own foreignness and that they were improperly interfering in another country's election. If they had initially been given the benefit of the doubt as a charming renegade, Dotcom was now the angry guest who had outstayed their welcome.
Key summed up in blunt terms what most voters thought about the “Moment of Truth,” telling a radio station: “Dotcom is trying to save Dotcom's butt, and it's a reasonably large one so he's bought in all of these people, three little butts to save their butt, and it won't work but they'll say and do anything and bamboozle people.” The fact that no credible proof emerged at the “Moment of Truth” to support Dotcom's much promised “big reveal” – which revolved around an outlandish conspiracy theory that New Zealand had granted them residency only to make it easier for the United States to extradite them – only added to voters' impression that they were a charlatan.
In May, Kim Dotcom described their pet political party as their “gift to New Zealand.” On election night, they were forced to concede that their very brand had been toxic. For John Key, Dotcom turned out to be the gift that kept on giving. New Zealand voters' loathing of Kim Dotcom and their tainting of the country's left played no small part in delivering Key's center-right National Party a landslide victory. After the election, a jubilant Key had only one piece of advice for the defeated Dotcom. “Go away.”

Human remains buried by a pair of monks in China over a millennium ago are claimed to belong to Buddha.
Believers say the 2,000 pieces of cremated bones belonged to Siddhartha Gautama, whose teachings became the foundations of the Buddhist religion.
The cremated bones were found in an ceramic box with an inscription claiming they belong to Buddha, who is believed to have died 2,500 years ago.
The box was found in Jingchuan County, China, alongside more than 260 Buddhist statues.
A discovery found hidden inside a 1,000-year-old Chinese chest could help archaeologists reach enlightenment. Human remains buried by a pair of monks over a millennium ago are claimed to belong to the Buddha
ADDITIONAL FINDS In addition to the chest, archaeologists also found a collection of 260 two metre (6.6 foot) high statues. However, they are unsure whether the stone figures were buried at the same time as the collection of bones. The carved objects depict the Buddha and their followers, as well as deities and a collection of steles, tall stone blocks which may be inscribed, carved or painted. The statues were carved between the Wei dynasty (386 to 534 AD) and the Song dynasty (960 to 1279 AD. Archaeologists also found the remains of a building that could be from the now lost Mañjuśrī Hall part of the temple complex.
Monks from the Mañjuśrī Temple of the Longxing Monastery in China's Jingzhou Prefecture, named Yunjiang and Zhiming, are said to have spent two decades collecting the artefacts from neighbouring countries.
Buddha, the philosopher and teacher, who is thought to have renounced their royal inheritance to follow a life of a spirituality, was born in modern day Nepal.
Holy texts say they travelled through the eastern parts of India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BC.
Legend also says that upon their death, around 2,500 years ago at the age of 80, Siddhartha Gautama's remains were divided up among their disciples and royalty and spread far and wide.
The Buddha's remains were originally meant to to go only to the Shakya clan, to which they belonged.
However, six clans and a king demanded the relics.
To avoid fighting, a religious leader divided them into ten portions, eight from the body relics, one from the ashes of Buddha's cremation pyre and one from the pot used to divide the relics, which they kept for himself.
The Buddha's relics were then enshrined and worshipped in stupas by their followers.
Any relic said to relate to known to relate to the Buddha, whose name means 'enlightened one', is known as a śarīra.
The discovery of the chest, known as an ossuary, was made by villagers conducting roadworks near the temple around five years ago.
It is said to contain more than 2,000 cremated remains, including teeth and bones.
It has only just been reported in English by the journal Chinese Cultural Relics.

This not the first time that remain said to belong to the Buddha have been uncovered.
WHO WAS BUDDHA? The legends associated with the major events of Buddha's life are based on a number of different historical sources, according to theVictoria and Albert museum. The most important is the Buddhacarita or 'The Acts of the Buddha', the first full length biography of the Buddha written by an Indian poet called Ashvaghosha in the 1st century AD. Siddhartha Gautama, who would become 'the enlightened one', is believed to have been a real person who lived between just after the mid 6th century and the late 5th century BC. The Buddha's parents were Suddhodana, king of the Sakyas, people living on the Indian borders of Nepal, and their wife Maya. The young prince grew up surrounded by luxury and wealth. They were protected from the harsh realities of life by their father who had been warned that their son would withdraw from the world should they encounter such sights. However, one day when riding outside the palace grounds, the future Buddha saw suffering for the first time. This kick-started a chain of events that would lead them on the path to enlightenment. After their enlightenment, Buddha travelled on foot throughout northern India, teaching constantly for forty-five years. People of all castes and professions, from kings to courtesans, were drawn to him. After their death, the Buddha's remains were enshrined and worshipped in stupas, like this one found in 2010 in China, by their followers. They answered their questions, always pointing them towards the true nature of reality. Throughout their life, Buddha encouraged their students to question their teachings and confirm them through their own experience. This non-dogmatic attitude still characterises Buddhism today. Upon their death, Buddha's remains were originally meant to to go only to the Shakya clan, to which they belonged. However, six clans and a king demanded the relics. To avoid fighting, a religious leader divided them into ten portions, eight from the body relics, one from the ashes of Buddha's cremation pyre and one from the pot used to divide the relics, which they kept for himself. The Buddha's relics were then enshrined and worshipped in stupas by their followers. Any relic said to relate to known to relate to the Buddha, whose name means 'enlightened one', is known as a śarīra.
A chunk of skull, mixed with a collection of remains of Buddhist saints, were found during excavations at a Buddhist temple in Nanjing, China, in 2010.
When they opened a stone chest in a crypt underneath the temple, they found an ornate shrine called a stupa, used for meditation.
According to Live Science, the shrine is a box 117 cm tall and 45 cm wide (4 feet by 1.5 feet) made from sandalwood, gold and silver with jewels embedded and contained the bone inside.
The bones were found within a tiny gold chest less than 8 cm (3.1 inches) tall, which itself was stored in a larger silver casket 20 cm (7.8 inches) tall.

Inscriptions carved into the protective stone chest as well as into the model shrine tell the story of how Buddha's skull bone came to lie in the tiny golden chest within
This casket was locked within the stupa, before the entire nest of boxes was stored safely within the stone chest - suggesting the contents held great importance to the monks at the Grand Bao'en Temple.
Inscriptions carved into the protective stone chest tell the story of how Buddha's skull bone came to lie in the tiny golden chest within.
According to a man known as 'Deming', after the Buddha died their body was cremated at the Hirannavati River, before the ruling king divided the remains into thousands of portions, 19 of which found their way to China.
One of these fragments was the fragment of parietal bone which inhabits the golden box along with the remains of other Buddhist saints.
But the journey took a number of turns, with the original resting place for the relic destroyed during a period of unrest.
The temple was then rebuilt by Emperor Zhenzong in the 11th Century, with the shrine placed safely within its crypt.

This year at FAMEX, Chinese manufacturer MMC introduces its new technology of hydrogen UAS HyDrone 1800 with upgraded specifications to meet higher standards in professional applications. The Feria Aeroespacial México 2017 (FAMEX 2017) kicks off at Mexico City on 26 April.
FAMEX 2017 is a commercial activity in the field of civil and military, aerospace, aeronautics, defense, and security as well as in education, which is held from 26 to 29 April 2017, in the Base Aérea Militar No. 1, in Santa Lucía, Zumpango, México.
The HyDrone 1800 can be utilized in aerial surveillance, reconnaissance, security control, emergency reaction, damage assessment, and other tasks depend on the payload it carries. The light weigh body offers flexible and efficient operation and maintenance during any task.
With maximum wind resistance of 10m/s, rain-proof, high heat-proof carbon fiber fuselage and a double-backup flight control system, this drone can be used in harsh weathers under very stable flight attitude. Meanwhile, with a patented “plug-and-play” mechanism interface, more than hundreds of payloads that under 5 kg could be attached to the platform for various purpose.
“This technology is a new step forward from concept into real applications,” says MMC's founder Lu Zhi Hui, “It's safe, it's effective, it's proven, and the endurance is unmatched by any other powered multi-rotor UAS in this time.”
The carbon-fiber HyDrone 1800 is an almost indestructible aircraft. Designed for use in the toughest conditions, the drone is wind-resistant, rain-resistant, cold-resistant and still incredibly lightweight. Most importantly, HyDrone 1800's hydrogen fuel cell technology provides a flight endurance of 4 hours or of a stunning 50+ hours when combined with MMC tethered technology.
The endurance of the hydrogen drone changes the scope of applications dramatically: most military or industrial drones currently on the market are limited by flight times of under 1 hour. HyDrone 1800 achieves the extended flight time while maintaining altitude limits of 4500 meters – competitive or better than other similar sized aircraft – and a payload capacity of up to 5kg.
OVER THE NEXT two years, the Irish Defence Forces will recruit about 1,450 young men and women for general military service.
There are approximately 9,500 soldiers in the Irish armed forces between army, naval service and air corps. However, only about 6% of the strength of our military is female.
This compares poorly with participation rates for women in the international military.
Almost 20% of the US military is comprised of women soldiers.
The French armed forces is approximately 20% female.
The NATO average for women's participation as soldiers is around 15%.
This places Ireland close to the bottom of the international league table for gender equality within the military.
There are historical and cultural reasons for this within Ireland.
Women were effectively de-barred from the Irish Defence Forces until the early 1980s.
Recruitment during subsequent decades was sporadic and the numbers of women within the Irish military was kept artificially low by discriminatory policies and practices adopted by a cautious and deeply conservative general staff.
Unfortunately, Irish female soldiers experienced unacceptably high levels of discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual violence during this period.
In 2000, as a serving Captain in the Army, I researched and wrote a comprehensive doctoral thesis on the equality culture of the Irish Defence Forces.
It contained stark findings as it applied to equality of opportunity and widespread allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault against female soldiers.
This prompted the then-Minister for Defence, Michael Smith TD, to order an independent government enquiry into the status and roles of women in the Irish Defence Forces.
The ‘Study Review Group' reported in 2003 and the Defence Forces implemented the majority of its recommendations and findings as it applied to both female and male soldiers, sailors and aircrew.
As a consequence, the Irish Defence Forces are now considered to be one of the most equality-friendly workplaces in the international military and considered an exemplar of equality of opportunity and dignity in the workplace for all of its personnel, irrespective of gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
New campaign
It is against this background that Minister for Defence, Simon Coveney directed that women be specifically targeted for enlistment to the Defence Forces during the current recruitment drive.
Women have been enlisted to the international military in ever greater numbers for more than a century. During World War 1, Tsar Nicholas II conscripted thousands of women into the Russian military to engage in brutal trench warfare. Their ferocity in hand-to-hand combat and close-quarter fighting earned female units the term “battalions of death”.
Russian women were conscripted by the Communists to the Red Army during World War 2 in order to fight the German Wehrmacht and Nazi SS military formations.
Up to one million Russian women fought in uniform in desperate circumstances along the Eastern Front.
The gender-integrated units of the Red Army and Air Force eventually defeated the Germans.
Female soldiers participated in the final assault on Berlin – the centre of Hitler's patriarchal ‘Fatherland'.
During this conflict, hundreds of thousands of women fought as partisans in France, Italy and Yugoslavia. Over 40,000 women were killed in action in the Balkans.
In these bitter conflicts, where mass murder, torture and ethnic cleansing were features of the battlefield, women were especially prized by military commanders for their physical strength, endurance and calmness in the field and their ability to resist torture and ill treatment.
In subsequent conflicts during the Cold War, women time and time again proved their mettle in combat.

In Vietnam, approximately 40% of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) commanders were women. Along with their gender-integrated allies the Viet Cong, they comprehensively defeated an almost exclusively male and technologically superior enemy in the US military.
By 1975, Vietnamese women and men effectively drove the US military out of Vietnamese territory.
The US military itself has incrementally recognised the value of female soldiers.
In Operations Desert Watch and Desert Storm, the US and its allies deployed 43,000 female troops against Saddam Hussein's elite all-male Republican Guard.
Outperforming all-male units
The women performed well in combat alongside their male peers and after-action reports and detailed research conducted by the US, British and Israeli military demonstrate conclusively that ‘mixed-gender' units – on land, sea and in the air – consistently outperform all-male units in combat conditions.
In the current Global War on Terror, about a quarter of a million female soldiers in the US military have passed through Shannon Airport on their way to combat in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Since 2003, 161 American women have been killed in action with over 10,000 wounded in combat operations.
The US Air Force in particular has benefitted from increased participation rates by female pilots and crew.
Combat experience and military aviation research has shown that female pilots are particularly skilled at flying in stressful, high-noise and high-vibration environments whilst simultaneously operating weapons systems and communications systems.
In short, women are effective at multi-tasking and have shown time and time again that they are indeed a more deadly species than the male.

In 1916, approximately 300 Irish women fought in the Rising in order to bring about the liberation of the State.
One hundred years later, it is fitting that the Defence Forces are seeking to recruit and harness the full potential of Irish women in our armed forces – both at home and abroad.
Women are absolutely essential to the continued success of both domestic security operations in the Republic to the peace enforcement and peacebuilding missions overseas for which the Irish Defence Forces are renowned.
Young women who join the Irish Defence Forces today will find an equality-friendly workplace which promotes the fullest participation of women and men alike in a life less ordinary – from refugee rescue operations in the Mediterranean to ground operations in the Golan Heights in Syria.

Ahead of key votes that are to take place over the next 24 hours, sources have revealed that there is a move to keep the new elimination format for Q1 and Q2 (with extended running), and change only the final session back to how it was last year.
The fiasco surrounding the end to Q3 at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix – when there were no cars on track and the top-eight race order was set well before the chequered flag – prompted teams to agree unanimously on Sunday morning to ditch the new style sessions in their entirety.
The plan was for F1 to go back immediately to the old qualifying system for the next race in Bahrain, while longer term evaluation was done on potentially bringing back a tweaked elimination format for 2017.

Potential U-turn on the U-turn
However, high level sources have revealed that such a move has not secured the automatic backing that some had been expecting from the FIA – and an alternative plan is being considered.
With the F1 Commission and the FIA's World Motor Sport Council due to decide before the end of Thursday about what will happen for Bahrain, it is understood that support is now being garnered for a compromise arrangement for the next race.
As a one-off, efforts are being made in some quarters to keep for Bahrain the new Q1 and Q2 elimination formats but extending the periods before the knock-out, and then have a more traditional Q3 that runs like the old system.
That will then give F1 more time to fully understand if it can get the elimination format working.

Long-term plan yet to be settled
Once the Bahrain system has played out, F1 chiefs would then be able to work on a permanent plan that can be put in place for the remainder of the season.
Due to F1's governance process, any change to the rules requires unanimous support – and without that, the Australian-style elimination format would have to remain in place.
So even though teams would prefer to go back to last year's system, without the FIA's backing then there is no chance of that rule change going through.
It could be then that to align Ecclestone, the teams and the FIA, the tweaked version may have to be accepted by all parties as a compromise deal.
Going back
Pirelli and Force India both admitted at the Australian GP that they were not convinced about the need to abandon elimination qualifying entirely.
Force India deputy team principal Bob Fernley told Motorsport.com that they would lobby for a tweaked Q3, although you would not block going back if it was the only one against it.
"We would never stand up as a lone voice if it was detrimental for Formula 1," they said.
"When it comes to what is good for fans and good for F1, that we will never get in the way of.
“But we were all working under a pressure cooker [in qualifying]. So it seems a shame to me to throw it all away when you have never evaluated it properly.”

ORLANDO, Fla.—With Orlando City SC stuck in a major slump, their playoff hopes hanging by a thread, Kaká is conducting an intervention. The captain plans to shoulder more of the load, taking a more vocal role in getting their teammates back on track.
Kaká's pronouncements followed an internal heart-to-heart before Thursday's training session. The players and coaching staff spoke freely, clearing the air as they aim to rectify a 1-6-2 run that has dropped the Lions to eighth in the Eastern Conference. Orlando is tied on points with New York City and Montreal for the final playoff spot, but the Lions and NYCFC have each played four more games than the Impact.
“It has been a tough period for us, but I love this kind of crisis because it means you have to find a solution,” Kaká said. “Our target is still the playoffs. We have to believe [it is possible] and that we can find a solution.
“I think I have an important responsibility for this, to carry the team and find ways to lift the players. For me, it is a time to prepare better and be more vocal. Most of the guys are young and have never had this situation before, but I tell them that this experience is a great opportunity to learn and push through.”
Orlando's big-name Designated Player said the meeting was positive. Everyone had the chance to participate, suggesting ways to get the Lions back to the form that had them as high as third in the East during June.
“It was very good as everybody had something to say to improve things and get better,” Kaká said. “Mostly, I think we have lost some confidence, which happens when things don't go well for a period. So it is important for them to know that even if they make mistakes, it happens; it is not the end. It is nice when you can teach them some things like this. I tell them: you learn about yourself in a tough period.
“We also can't forget this is our first season. It is good to be part of this, with new things and new challenges. I have never really been in this situation before myself, so it is good for me as well. But things like this make me stronger. We have to be strong mentally to be supportive of the team and your teammates.”
The Brazilian ace insists they will be more demonstrative in a bid to get the best out of Orlando's younger players, who have struggled in recent weeks.
“At this moment, I think I have to speak a little bit more,” Kaká added. “I don't like to speak too much, but I want them to know and see what I am doing, what I am trying to do. Even if I have won many things in soccer before, I still want to win here, and this is the time to say something now.
“We are a team, so if there are three players marking me, someone else in our team is going to be free, so we have to find this kind of solution. Everybody needs to know exactly what they have to do.”
Head coach Adrian Heath was encouraged by the meeting, which carried over into a lively training session.
“We have had a good chat with the guys and we think we're still in this,” they said. “If we can win our home games and pick up some points away, we have a chance. We needed to have one or two people getting things off their chest, but now it's a case of 'talk is cheap.' We need to see the action.”
Heath was also quick to point out that any potential playoff push would be a result of a comprehensive effort from the entire squad, not just Kaká lifting the group.
“Ricky [Kaká] is the obvious focus surrounding this club, but it can't just be him," Heath said. "This can't be an individual game, it is collective – the coaching staff included.
“I think we have to get more intensity. People tend to drop off when they have little knocks and other setbacks, so it's a case of getting them to step it up again. What we don't want to do is let the season fizzle out. We need to find every bit of intensity we can to finish it off well.”
Lassana Diarra was handed a recall to the France squad on Thursday, more than five years since they made their last appearance.
The midfielder joined Marseille in July and has turned in a number of outstanding performances to catch the eye of Les Bleus boss Didier Deschamps.
The call-up completes a remarkable upturn in former Real Madrid star Diarra's fortunes after they were left without a club last season following a contract dispute at Lokomotiv Moscow. Their last France cap came against Norway in August 2010.
The challenge now for the 30-year-old is to force their way into the France squad for next year's European Championship, a tournament they are hosting, and strong performances against Armenia on October 8 and Denmark three days later will certainly help their cause.
Goalkeeper Alphonse Areola was also included by Deschamps but there is no place for winger Hatem Ben Arfa despite their fine form for Nice.
Squad in full:
Goalkeepers: Alphonse Areola (Villarreal), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Steve Mandanda (Marseille)
Defenders: Patrice Evra (Juventus), Christophe Jallet (Lyon), Eliaquim Mangala (Manchester City), Bacary Sagna (Manchester City), Mamadou Sakho (Liverpool), Benoit Tremoulinas (Bordeaux), Raphael Varane (Real Madrid), Kurt Zouma (Chelsea)
Midfielders: Yohan Cabaye (Crystal Palace), Lassana Diarra (Marseille), Blaise Matuidi (Paris Saint-Germain), Paul Pogba (Juventus), Morgan Schneiderlin (Manchester United), Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle United)
Forwards: Karim Benzema (Real Madrid), Olivier Giroud (Arsenal), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid), Anthony Martial (Manchester United), Paul-Georges Ntep (Rennes), Mathieu Valbuena (Lyon)

Spoilers! If you haven't seen the season 3 finale of Mr. Robot, there are major spoilers below. Also, all of the information you see here is meant for educational purposes only, and should not be used to try and brute force someone's passphrase.
If you watched last night's episode of Mr. Robot, you witnessed Elliot performs some hacking magic to decrypt Romero's keylogger files. The following is an explanation of what actually is happening in that scene, and what assumptions the writers of Mr. Robot are making.
The scene starts off with Agent DiPierro logging into an FBI computer from Agent Santiego's car. Next, they hand over access to Elliot who in a minute or two has completey decrypted Romero's keylogger files. A good place to start is by explaining what is a keylogger? A keylogger is just a hardware device or a software program that records the real time activity of a computer user including the keys they press. Romero had one running during the initial Evil Corp. hack, which could have the private keys to undo it.
The FBI had Romero's key logger files but they encrypted them with a password. Thing is .. the FBI didn't know Romero, I do.
When referring to a computer hard drive, a partition is a section of the hard drive that is separated from other segments. Partitions help enable users to divide a computer hard drive into different drives or different portions. The steps to encrypt one of these partitions is pretty simple. Romero would have most likely used the program cryptsetup to setup the cryptographic volume, and a quick overview of how this could have been is below.
Copy data The first step is to copy the data from somewhere on disk. The reason is because you can't change an existing partition into an encrypted one. First the data is copied somewhere, then you create the encrypted partition, and copy the data back to it.
Format the partition with LUKS LUKS is the standard for Linux hard disk encryption, and encrypts entire block devices and is therefore well-suited for protecting the contents of mobile devices such as removable storage media (usb pen) or laptop disk drives. It does not only facilitate compatibility among distributions, but also provides secure management of multiple user passwords. If you have a partition that is ready to use, you can prepare it with "cryptsetup luksFormat". You'll then be asked to set a password for use with the encryption. This was where Romero set the password that Elliot brute forces using song lyrics. cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /media/keyintercept_1 WARNING! ======== This will overwrite data on /media/keyintercept_1 irrevocably. Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES Enter LUKS passphrase: Verify passphrase: Command successful.
Format the partition is now available, but needs to be formatted with the normal filesystem tools to be usable. You can use a tool like mke2fs to create the new file system. Once the file system is created you can mount it, which just means placing access to the file system contained within onto your root file system structure. Effectively giving the files a location.
Copy data to the partition The data copied in the first step can now be placed on the partition, where it is fully encypted and password protected.
The next thing we see is Elliot running a python program from a shell. Python is a general purpose programming language, and a shell is just an interface to the operating systems services.
The command Elliot runs is pretty straighfoward. The important parts are that they have a script called "getlyrics.py" that they execute, and they pass in the name of a text file called "artists.txt" which most likely is a file with the names of artists Romero liked.
# python getlyrics.py -m artist -i artists.txt -o lyrics.txt
We can see that Elliot is running Kali linux, but it's unclear if the FBI machine they are using runs Kali, or if he's logged into a remote machine. Why is this important? In order to run the python program "getlyrics.py" the system Elliot is using needs Python installed, along with other packages like PyLyrics, (which downloads song lyrics) and the script they execute "getlyrics.py" would also need to be present on the machine filesystem (or accessible from somewhere).
The more likely scenario would be that Elliot SSH'd into a remote server that they control, where they have everything they need installed already. In order to log in to said server Elliot would also need to have their private key (assuming they disabled password logins, which is highly likey for a super hacker like Elliot). Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network, and a private key can be thought of as a really long password. So long, that it's extremely difficult to brute force. It's also possible Elliot stored the scripts and files they need on a public server somewhere (or thumb drive) and just downloaded them as needed.
The scene does not show that Elliot logged into a remote machine so we'll just assume he's running the commands on the FBI machine locally, and everything is installed and ready to go. After Elliot executes the script, we see that some songs are being downloaded. What exactly is happening here? We here Elliot mentions that they "knows Romero". This is impying that Elliot knows how Romero might have picked a password for their encypted files. We can assume the code in the script Elliot runs is downloading song lyrics from artists Romero listened to. What might the code for something like this look like? It's actually pretty trivial.
# PyLyrics is a python module to get Lyrics of songs from lyrics.wikia.com # It has support for getting albums of a singer and songs from an album from which lyrics can be accessed from PyLyrics import * # Read in the file that has a list of artists Romero liked artists = open (sys.argv[4], 'r' ) # This is the output file using the argument from the command line # All the lyrics will be written to this file, and is later # used as a list of passwords to test against the encypted file password lyrics = open (sys.argv[6], 'w' ) # For every artist, get a list of tracks and download the lyrics for artist in artists: albums = PyLyrics.getAlbums( singer =artist) # Loop through every album and get the tracks for album in albums: tracks = album.tracks() for track in tracks: We download the lyrics and write the output to our lyrics file lyrics.write(track.getLyrics()) artists.close() lyrics.close()
After the code above is done executing, we're left with a file "lyrics.txt" which has a bunch of song lyrics in it. A portion of the output would look like something below.
And Nixon talking about don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry) But they don't know There can be no show And if there's hell below We're all gonna go (gonna go, gonna go, gonna go, go) Everybody prays And everybody says But when come time to do Everybody's laying
Next we see Elliot brute force the LUKS encypted drive with a bunch of passwords. It appears that Elliot is using a program called bruteforce-luks. This program must be compiled and configured first. If Elliot is running directly from the FBI machine (and not a remote server) the program would have either been compiled before or they would have had to do that once they got access from DiPierro. Either way, we don't see this step and can just assume it's already been compiled and ready for use when Elliot starts using the machine.
We see that Elliot is running "bruteforce-luks" in dictionary mode. This means the program tries to decrypt at least one of the key slots by trying all the passwords contained in a file. The file must have one password per line. We can see in the episode that the password found is "And if there's hell below We're all gonna go". What this tells us is that the program Elliot executes would also most likely need to do some processing to generate a full lyric on each line. We can also see from our lyrics output that the lyric containing the password has parenthises at the end inclusding some extra content (gonna go, gonna go, gonna go, go) . This is not part of the password so the program would also need to remove extra tokens like this, and also combine multiple lyrics per line.
Brute forcing a password this way is definitley possible, but using song lyrics is pretty unreliable as you can see. Since the program to bruce force uses each line of our dictionary to test the LUKS volume, the lyric has to be exactly right. The output file with lyrics would have needed a line with the following lyrics exactly. That means no extra spaces, apostraphes, commas, brackets, missing letters, etc. If Romero had used "there is" instead of "there's" we would not find the password; if Romero used "going to go" instead of "gonna go" a password would not have been found. If the lyrics website (lyrics.wikia.com) had returned a lyric with an extra space somewhere, the password would not have been found. There are so many places this could fail that it almost isn't worth the effort, but when they fate of undoing 5/9 relies on it, it's definelty worth a shot!
Once Elliot gets the password, decrypting Romero's files becomes pretty trivial. All they do is use the same program from before (cryptsetep) and use the password found to decrypt it.
# cryptsetup luksOpen ~/keyintercept_1.raw keyintercept
The next step is to open the partition and set up a mapping name. It's here where Elliot will have to enter the passphrase to decrypt the partition. The mapped partition is now available in ~/keyintercept_1.raw/keyintercept but it isn't mounted. The last step is create a mount point and to mount the mapped partition. Elliot can now open the files and view them directly in plain text. In the episode, it looks like Elliot had already mounted the drive, and uses lsblk to get information about it. lsblk lists information about all available or the specified block devices. The command prints all block devices in a tree-like format by default. It's this command that shows Elliot where the exact location of the data they want is.
This is it, everything that was typed on those machines at the arcade on the night of the hack. Using a program called bruteforce-luks, Elliot is able to use the lyrics file they generated to bruce force a password and decypt Romero's files. They perform these steps in what apears to be a minute on the show, but this would definitly take some time to setup at least. We don't see them generate the artists file, or write the code for retriving lyrics, or install any software. If all those things were done and setup perfectly for Elliot when starting, then a minute or two for the hack seams reasonable.
In conclusion, this is definitly a plausible hack, and it's fun to see how the writers come up with these scenarios. In reality, trying to find the password the way Elliot did would be pretty hit or miss, and it would take some time setting up the environment (installing programs, writing the code, etc.). The key piece of information to take away from this hack is that it all comes down to Elliot knowing that Romero used a song lyric in their password. They also needed to know which artists specifically, and that their password would be an exact match to a lyric from a song by that artist.
This is episode 134 of the Promotional Malpractice Live Chat.
The proposed Yoel Romero vs. Ronaldo Souza fight may be (which is a tremendous bummer), but the rest of the UFC on FOX 15 card on Saturday still leaves a lot to enjoy. The main event is still in place and the rest of the main card absent the new Jacare fight with Chris Camozzi is still quite good. I have a particular preference for Cub Swanson vs. Max Halloway, but there's more where that came from. The main event has huge relevance for the sport and is evidence of just how good the division is right now.
This past weekend, there was also a lot going on in the world of combat sports. UFC Fight Night 64, WSOF 20 and Bellator 136. We'll talk about each and every angle of those events as well.
There's also just weirdness. For example, Conor McGregor got a tattoo of a tiger's face on their stomach of all places. And in more serious news, Nate Diaz's ongoing winter of discontent with respect to the UFC shows no signs of letting up.
There's a lot going on, so join me today to discuss all of this and more. In terms of today's chat, anything is up for discussion, but I will lead with this and it all kicks off at 1 p.m. ET.
As is customary, I'll post the video window here as the event draws near and I'll answer any questions you may have if you post them in the comments section below. Be sure that you click the 'rec' button for those comments/questions you believe most deserve a response.

Washington -- Turkey's foreign minister said Tuesday that their government is "not happy" with the U.S. response to Israel's raid on an aid flotilla carrying humanitarian goods bound for blockaded Gaza.
"We expect full solidarity from the United States," Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said before a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "We are not happy with the U.S. statement from yesterday."
Davutoglu called on the United States to condemn the attack, express solidarity with the families of the victims and exert pressure on Israel to free prisoners taken during the raid.
"Israel thinks it's above the law," Davutoglu said. They warned that if some countries choose to follow the "rule of the jungle ... we know what to do."
President Obama has expressed "deep regret" at the deaths caused by the incident and also "expressed the importance of learning all the facts and circumstances around this morning's tragic events as soon as possible," the White House said Monday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a scheduled meeting with Obama this week to return to Israel to manage the crisis.
Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Namik Tan, called the U.S. response "sort of weak."
It is not clear how many people died in Monday's pre-dawn raid. Israel put the number at nine but did not release the names of those who died. The Free Gaza Movement, one of the groups that organized the convoy of six ships, said the fatalities numbered higher but did not offer an exact number.
Israel has said that several hundred activists seized during the raid have been transported to Beer Sheva prison in southern Israel. Forty-five have been released and were either deported or on their way to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. Those who remain detained have refused to identify themselves to Israeli immigration authorities, an Israeli Prison Authority spokesperson said. None has been placed under arrest, they said.
The Israeli attack has sparked protests in several countries and brought condemnation worldwide. Davutoglu said Tuesday that for Turks, the attack is psychologically "like 9/11."
Turkey is historically Israel's closest Muslim ally in the Middle East.
The Freedom Flotilla was organized by the Free Gaza Movement, a Cyprus-based human rights group, and the pro-Palestinian Turkish organization Insani Yardim Vakfi. The flotilla of six ships -- three passenger and three cargo vessels -- left Cyprus on Sunday, carrying more than 10,000 tons of aid and about 600 passengers from more than 20 countries, the movement said.
Activists said they wanted to raise awareness of "the illegal siege of Gaza" by Israel, which instituted a blockade on Gaza in 2007.

Germans protest against the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement that also includes the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the United States and the European Union, and the Trans Pacific Partnership. (Photo: Uwe Hiksch / Mehr Demokratie)
In a move that has many on the left cautiously celebrating, Reuters reported on July 28 that Germany might reject a new trade agreement between Canada and the European Union.
The deal is called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA. It's part of a new wave of large, aggressive trade deals that also includes the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union, and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) between 12 countries of the Pacific Rim.
If all the deals passed, they would affect more than half of the world's economy. But the red light from Germany could signal that these agreements are not as inevitable as their advocates suggest.
Germany's objections are centered specifically on the so-called “investor-state dispute settlement” provisions in CETA. These provisions—also known by the acronym ISDS—allow transnational corporations to take legal action against individual governments if they believe that the country's domestic laws violate a trade agreement. And the legal disputes happen through arbitration, which is a way to settle disputes completely outside of the involved countries' courts.
We've seen this movie before. Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) stipulates that three-person panels of private attorneys decide who wins in disputes between corporations and individual governments. These proceedings are closed to public observation.
The fallout has been dramatic: Corporations have used the NAFTA tribunals to win big-ticket monetary settlements from the taxpayers of nations whose domestic laws interfere with corporate profits. According to a report by the consumer-rights advocacy group Public Citizen, there are 17 pending claims in which corporations are seeking a total of $38 billion through NAFTA and other deals.
The compensation won through these claims hits particularly hard in Argentina—the most frequent target of these cases according to a 2014 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In one example, Argentina was ordered to pay $185.3 million to the energy company BG Group, who sued for profits lost when the country froze gas prices in 2001.
Argentina is not alone: another report by the same U.N. group shows that 66 percent of investor-state cases initiated in 2012 were brought against “developing or transition economies”:

Meanwhile, the number of corporate claims has been on the rise: The UNCTD's report from 2014 shows that in 2002 there were fewer than 100 known treaty-based ISDS cases. By 2013, that number had reached 568—a five-fold increase over 11 years:

The cases settled through NAFTA's dispute resolution tribunals show corporate and investor rights trumping national sovereignty and domestic laws. Exxon Mobil won $60 million from Canada in 2007 because local regulations required oil companies to pay to support research and development in the country's poorest provinces. U.S. energy company Lone Pine Resources is seeking CA$250 million in damages because the firm “expended millions of dollars and considerable time and resources” on a fracking project before Quebec banned fracking in 2011—a decision Lone Pine called “arbitrary” and “capricious.”
Opposition to these provisions is not limited to the political left. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has taken issue with investor-state dispute provisions in trade agreements like the TPP and TTIP. The institute's Free Trade Bulletin argued in March that investor-state dispute settlements are “an unnecessary, unreasonable, and unwise provision to include,” and suggests sacrificing the provision in order to save the trade agreements.
Some implications
Germany is no stranger to similar dispute settlements. After the country decided to phase out nuclear power following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011, the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall filed for arbitration to seek €3.5 billion ($4.6 billion) in damages, blaming the country for past and future loss of profits.
Considering how that worked out, Germany's change of heart is perhaps to be expected. But some commentators see the move as proof that global organizing against the new round of trade agreements is gaining ground. Arthur Stamoulis, director of the Citizens Trade Campaign, noted that “The German government and other governments are starting to feel the heat from public opposition to [investor-state dispute settlements].”
Yet not everyone is convinced by the messages coming out of Berlin. Peter Fuchs, executive director of PowerShift, a Berlin-based NGO focused on international trade and investment policy, expressed skepticism toward the idea that German opposition will sink CETA.
“Unfortunately, you cannot trust this government at all when corporate interests are at stake,” Fuchs said, calling the German government “a staunch proponent of neoliberal trade and investment agreements.”
According to Fuchs, this is a time for the public to ramp up pressure by calling on politicians to reject the trade deals. They pointed to the upcoming European Citizens Initiative against TTIP and CETA as one campaign aimed at making that happen.
However seriously one takes Germany's apparent about-face, the development has emboldened the fight against the agreement. And with a growing chorus of skeptics from both left and right, these problematic provisions seem newly vulnerable, as do the agreements overall.
As Arthur Stamoulis told YES, “With renewed activism, corporate power grabs like CETA, TTIP and the TPP … really can be stopped.”
Movie Review Mistaken For Strangers B+ Movie Review Mistaken For Strangers B+ B+ Mistaken For Strangers Director Tom Berninger Runtime 74 minutes Rating Not Rated Cast Documentary
Mistaken For Strangers is as much a film about its director as it is about The National, which may qualify it as an entirely new kind of rock doc. The premise is almost too cutesy to believe: Matt Berninger, singer for the increasingly successful band, hires their mild fuck-up metalhead of a younger brother, Tom, to act as a roadie on a big European tour. Tom, who still lives with their parents in Cincinnati and makes low-budget horror movies in their spare time, decides to film the whole thing while also shirking their roadie responsibilities. They alternately delight and annoys their subjects, who don't have much to say in response to their questions—or lack thereof. (“How famous are you?” they inquire at one point.)

But the film quickly seems like less of a lark or meta-commentary on music documentaries and more of a sketch of an odd-but-close brotherly bond. Tom is an open book: They just wants to have fun, drink, and listen to Rob Halford's Christmas album, and their more responsible older brother wants to help them get their shit together. It's abundantly clear that Tom is jealous of Matt's success, and maybe a little confused by it, but because they know their big brother so well, he's completely guileless as a director, and unafraid. More than once, Matt tells Tom to stop filming—whether because they just needs space, or because there are celebrities around who might be bothered by it—but Tom never does: He's relentless but well liked (by everybody except the tour manager, anyway).
Of course they get fired—after not doing their job, missing the bus, spilling cereal on the bathroom floor and not cleaning it up. The last chunk of this 75-minute film offers them a slight redemptive arc, as they head back home to quiz their parents about their childhood—Mrs. Berninger insists Tom was always the more talented one—and take a little stock of himself. It's not like they ever falls so far that he's in any sort of real danger (and mugging at their own camera is never far off), but Tom does seem to find some tiny epiphany by looking at themselves through their famous brother's eyes. It's a funny, weird, and entirely believable relationship that just happens to be set in proximity to one of the best bands of the moment. If you admired The National—and particularly Matt Berninger—before, Mistaken For Strangers will humanize them more than their cryptic lyrics ever could. But their non-famous co-star, and their relationship, is intriguing and entertaining enough to carry the movie even for those totally unaware of “Mr. November” or “Terrible Love.”
SVU-AS , a bullpup rifle with the action located behind the trigger. SVDS , a conventionally configured rifle using the same action.
A bullpup is a firearm with its action and magazine behind the trigger. This creates shorter weapons in comparison to rifles with the same size of gun barrel. This means the advantages of a longer barrel such as muzzle velocity and accuracy are retained while reducing the overall size and weight of the weapon.
The bullpup concept was first tested in 1901 with the British-made Thorneycroft carbine. But it was not until the Cold War that more successful designs and improvements made the weapon successful. In the 1970s, Austria became the first army in the world to adopt a bullpup rifle as a principal combat weapon. Since then the military in many countries have followed suit, such as the UK, China, Israel and Australia.
Etymology [ edit ]
The origin of the term "bullpup" for this configuration is unclear. In 1957, the word was reported to denote a target pistol, particularly one with a fancy stock.[1]
Description [ edit ]
The bullpup design places the gun's action behind the trigger, usually in front of a short stock.[2] The entire magazine is often also located behind the trigger group,[2] though it is only necessary for the weapon's feed location to be located there for it to be classified as a bullpup; in some designs such as the Heckler & Koch G11 and Neostead the magazine or magazines extend forward rather than downward.[3]
The FN P90 uses the bullpup layout in conjunction with a unique top-mounted feeding system, making it the most compact personal defense weapon with a fixed stock
Benefits and limitations [ edit ]
The primary benefit of a bullpup weapon is that the weapon's overall length can be significantly decreased without reducing the barrel length. This allows a bullpup weapon to be maneuvered in tight spaces and concealed more easily than a conventional weapon with a similar barrel length. [4]
Because bullpups are held closer to the body, they cause less arm fatigue and allow a faster reaction time from a lowered position.
In a bullpup weapon, the user's face is much closer to the action. This increases noise issues, can cause spent bullet casings to be ejected into the face of left-handed shooters and renders it difficult for a right-handed shooter to "off-hand" the weapon. [2] For weapons with reciprocating charging handles, there is also the risk of the charging handle striking a left-handed user. As a result, bullpups often require unusual ejection mechanisms in order to allow ambidextrous operation. This is solved on some designs with ejection downward (FN P90, Kel-Tec RDB) or forward (FN F2000, [2] Kel-Tec RFB). [5]
For weapons with reciprocating charging handles, there is also the risk of the charging handle striking a left-handed user. As a result, bullpups often require unusual ejection mechanisms in order to allow ambidextrous operation. This is solved on some designs with ejection downward (FN P90, Kel-Tec RDB) or forward (FN F2000, Kel-Tec RFB). In weapons which have reversible bullpup actions, propellant gas can escape from the blanked-off side of the action. In the event of a catastrophic weapon malfunction, the user is more likely to be injured.
Bullpups tend to have more weight concentrated rearwards than conventional weapons. As a result, they often lack balance, inducing muzzle rise and inaccurate automatic fire. However, this same distribution of weight also tends to make them very easy to move about quickly to engage targets in close quarters combat.
The shorter weapon length often results in a shorter sight radius (when using iron sights), impairing accuracy at distance, as well as reducing bayonet effectiveness in close combat. However, since bullpups are more frequently used in close-quarters combat, modern rifles tend to use optical sights over iron sights, and bayonets are rarely used in modern combat, this is generally not a huge issue.
Due to the forward assembly and the necessary trigger linkage, bullpups tend to have less precise triggers. Thus, bullpup trigger pull characteristics are often criticized. [6]
Due to the unusual placement of the magazine and controls, shooters accustomed to conventional firearms will take longer to adjust to the manual of arms of a bullpup than they would a different conventionally laid out rifle. In particular, AK-type bullpups can be difficult to load due to their "rock and lock" mechanism.
Bullpups often do not have adjustable stocks.
Some weapons, such as the M16, use the space in the stock to store cleaning kits and other tools/accessories. For bullpup designs, these must be stored elsewhere or carried separately.
History [ edit ]
The concept was first used in bolt action rifles such as the Thorneycroft carbine of 1901, although the increased distance from hand grip to bolt handle meant the decreased length had to be weighed against the increased time required to fire. It is known to have been applied to semi-automatic firearms in 1918 (6.5 mm French Faucon-Meunier semi-automatic rifle developed by Lt. Col. Armand-Frédéric Faucon), then in 1936 a bullpup machine pistol was patented by the Frenchman Henri Delacre.[7]
EM-2 , an experimental British assault rifle of the 1950s.
After World War II, Western engineers drew inspiration from the German Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, which offered a compromise between bolt-action rifles and submachine guns. Among them was Kazimierz Januszewski (also known as Stefan Janson), a Polish engineer who had worked at the Polish national arsenal during the 1930s. After being mobilized during World War II they escaped German and Russian forces and made their way to England, where they were a part of the "Polish design team" at Enfield Lock's Royal Small Arms Factory. The factory was run by lieutenant colonel Edward Kent-Lemon. As Januszewski was developing a new rifle, the "Ideal Calibre Board" was searching for a replacement for the .303 cartridge. The Board decided on an optimal 7 mm cartridge on which Januszewski and the two teams working at Enfield had to base their designs. One design team led by Stanley Thorpe produced a gas-powered rifle with a locking system based on the Sturmgewehr. The design used steel pressings which were difficult to obtain, and the design was scrapped. The result of the Polish design team's efforts was the EM-2, which broke significant new ground.[8]
The EM-2 contained some similarities to the Soviet AK-47, although Januszewski had never seen the Soviet rifle. The first significant bullpup assault rifle came from the British programme to replace the service pistols, sub-machine guns, and rifles. In the two forms of the EM-1 and the EM-2, the new rifle concept was born as a result of the experience with small arms that was gained during the Second World War.[8]
It was obvious that the modern warfare would require the infantry to be armed with a light, selective fire weapon, with effective range of fire much longer than that of a submachine gun, but shorter than that of conventional semi-automatic or bolt action rifles. The bullpup design was seen as a necessity to retain the accuracy at range while reducing overall length. The EM-2 was adopted by the UK in 1951 as the world's first (limited) service bullpup rifle, but was promptly displaced by the adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO (0.308 in) cartridge, to which the EM-2 was not easily adapted. The decision was rescinded and a variant of the more conventional FN FAL was adopted in its place.[9]
A 7.62×39mm M43 calibre experimental assault rifle was developed by German A. Korobov in the Soviet Union around 1945, and a further development, the TKB-408 was entered for the 1946–47 assault rifle trials by the Soviet Army, although it was rejected in favour of the more conventional AK-47. The United States briefly experimented in the same year with the integrally-scoped Model 45A bullpup, which never progressed beyond the prototype stage; John Garand designed their T31 bullpup, abandoned after their retirement in 1953.
After these failures of the bullpup design to achieve widespread service, the concept continued to be explored (for example: a second Korobov bullpup, the TKB-022PM).
Adoption [ edit ]
The Steyr AUG was one of the first bullpup rifles to enter widespread use.
The SAR 21 with the attached Round Corner Firing (RCF) module
The L85A2 rifle, variant of the SA80 series of weapons.
The Steyr AUG (selected in 1977) is often cited as the first successful bullpup,[10][11][12] being in service with the armed forces of over twenty countries, and becoming the primary rifle of Austria and Australia. It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. Highly reliable, light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. The arrival of the FAMAS in 1978, and its adoption by France emphasized the slide from traditional to bullpup layouts within gun designs.[12]
The British resumed their bullpup experiments with the L85, which entered service in 1985. Following persistent reliability problems, it was redesigned by the then British-owned Heckler & Koch into the L85A2, and it is now a reliable weapon.[13]
Having learned from extensive combat experience, Israel Military Industries developed a bullpup rifle: the Tavor TAR-21. The Tavor is light, accurate, fully ambidextrous and reliable (designed to stringent reliability standards to avoid malfunctioning in desert conditions), and is in increasing demand in other countries, notably India.[2] The Tavor shares many similarities with the SAR 21 and the South African Vektor CR-21.[2] The Islamic Republic of Iran Army has adopted the KH-2002 and the Chinese People's Liberation Army uses the QBZ-95.[14]
Some sniper rifles such as the American Barrett M95 and XM500,[15] German Walther WA 2000 and DSR-1,[16] Chinese QBU-88, Russian SVU, and Polish Bor use the bullpup layout. It is also used for combat shotgun designs such as the Neostead and Kel-Tec KSG.[17]

US federal agents tracking cybercriminals who broke into the networks of JPMorgan Chase & Co are "confident" charges will be filed in the coming months.
Law enforcement agencies investigating the breach believe a criminal case will be filed against the hackers this year, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to the publication, federal agents are "increasingly confident" they are on the right trail to unmask and apprehend the hackers.
In addition, law enforcement officials believe at least several of those suspected to have taken part in the cyberattack are "gettable" -- in other words, they live in countries where an extradition treaty with the United States is in place. Countries including Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam and Morocco are not included.
In late summer last year, the financial services firm discovered a data breach which resulted in the theft of 83 million accounts belonging to households and small businesses. The names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and internal JPMorgan Chase user records were all compromised, although no financial information, Social Security numbers, dates of birth or usernames and passwords were lost.
The cyberattackers were able to access JPMorgan's networks through a compromised employee computer which was infected with malware. The malicious code then established a VPN tunnel into the corporation's systems, granting the hackers access to databases where sensitive information was stored.
The case is advancing more quickly than previous estimates, as the attack "was not nearly as sophisticated as initially believed," the NYT says. As a result, federal agents were able to identify a number of suspects early on, a crucial factor in the investigation.
The JPMorgan hacking case has become a top priority, as the banking system is considered critical infrastructure in the United States. The case is being handled by top law enforcement and senior investigators in the FBI.
High-profile attacks against US companies and retailers are becoming monthly news bites in a world where digital warfare and cyberespionage are used to steal valuable data or to cripple computer systems. Across the last year alone, Staples, Target and Sony have become poster children for data breaches -- resulting in the loss of millions of customer and employee records, the theft of executive communications and destruction of computer networks at high cost to each company, both financially and in reputation.

After 2015's historic gathering of Buddhists at the White House, Buddhists for Racial Justice (BRJ) was quickly launched, sharing resources and issuing both a “Call for Buddhist Practitioners of Color to Solidarity” and a “Call to White Buddhists.” Described initially as “an emerging national network of Buddhist practitioners and communities from across Buddhist traditions and racial, ethnic, and cultural background,” BRJ has now been folded into the work of the North American Buddhist Alliance, whose mission is to share “Dharma resources across Buddhist traditions. We aim to foster supportive networks. We encourage inclusive and equitable collaboration, communication, and interaction among Buddhists and Buddhist groups.”
According to a press release, NABA and BRJ's work together is to manifest in three key ways:
Buddhist teachings for individuals to selectively apply as each addresses that discriminating nature within and according to one's relative social position within the context of structural racism. A directory of Buddhist diversity trainers available and a collection of educational multimedia modules such as NABA's recent video recordings of the teachers' webinar on Gender and Race in a New Era with Venerable Pannavati and Venerable Lekshe. A repository and sharing of collective Buddhist initiatives or actions meant to be antidotes for systemic or structural racism.
To this end, NABA is already planning to host “two separate calls about racial justice with White Buddhists and Buddhists who are Persons of Color (POC)” on May 18, and May 25. You'll find details on joining those calls here.
Gameplay Edit
Pit fights the monsters of the game with a bow and arrow. The player character's health and the number of hearts is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. Doors in levels lead to different chambers, such as treasuries or item stores Kid Icarus is an action platformer with role-playing elements.[6] The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items.[7][8] Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows that can be upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases the range of the arrows.[8][9][10] These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough.[11] The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar at the end of a level if enough points were collected.[11][12] Throughout the stages, the player may enter doors to access seven different types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit's health.[8][9][13] In the god's chamber, the strength of Pit's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors, such as the number of enemies defeated and the amount of damage taken in battle.[9][11][13] In the training chamber, Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if they pass a test of endurance.[8][9] The game world is divided into three stages – the underworld, the over world (Earth) and the sky world.[14] Each stage encompasses three unidirectional area levels and a fortress.[14][15][16] The areas of the underworld and sky world stages have Pitted climb to the top, while those of the surface world are side-scrolling levels. The fortresses at the end of the stages are labyrinths with non-scrolling rooms, in which the player must find and defeat a gatekeeper boss.[8] Within a fortress, Pit may buy a check sheet, pencil and torch to guide them through the labyrinth.[9] A single-use item, the hammer, can destroy stone statues, which frees a flying soldier called a Centurion that will aid the player in boss battles.[9][17] For each of the bosses destroyed, Pit receives one of three sacred treasures that are needed to access the fourth and final stage, the sky temple.[8] This last portion abandons the platforming elements of the previous levels, and resembles a scrolling shooter.[8][18]
Plot Edit
See also: List of Kid Icarus characters The game is set in Angel Land, which is a fantasy world with a Greek mythology theme.[18][19] The backstory of Kid Icarus is described in the instruction booklet: before the events of the game, Earth was ruled by Palutena: Goddess of Light and Medusa: Goddess of Darkness. Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy. Medusa hated the humans, dried up their crop, and turned them to stone. Enraged by this, Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster and banished them to the Underworld. Out of revenge, Medusa conspired with the monsters of the Underworld to take over Palutena's residence the Palace in the Sky.[19] They launched a surprise attack, and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield, the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena's army of its power. After their soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa, Palutena was defeated in battle and imprisoned deep inside the Palace in the Sky. With their last power, they sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit. They escape from their prison in the Underworld and sets out to save Palutena and Angel Land.[19][20] Throughout the course of the story, Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at their respective fortresses in the Underworld, the Overworld, and the Skyworld.[14] Afterward, they equip themselves with the treasures and storms the sky temple where they defeat Medusa and rescues Palutena.[8] The game has five different endings;[21] depending on the player's performance, Palutena may present Pit with headgear or transform them into a full-grown angel.[8][11][22] In the Japanese version, the best ending from the English version does not exist, and instead another bad ending is present.[21]
Development and releases Edit
Reception Edit
Reception Review scores Publication Score GameSpot 5.1[7] IGN 7.0[15] ONM 68%[36] Kid Icarus had shipped 1.76 million copies worldwide by late 2003, and has gained a cult following.[15][37] In 2001 Game Informer ranked it the 83rd best game ever made. They claimed that despite its high level of difficulty and frustration, it was fun enough to be worth playing.[38] The game has been met with mixed reviews from critics over the years. In October 1992, a staff writer of the UK publication Nintendo Magazine System said that Kid Icarus was "pretty good fun", but did not "compare too well" to other platform games, owing in part to its "rather dated" graphics.[36] Retro Gamer magazine's Stuart Hunt called Kid Icarus an "unsung hero of the NES" that "looks and sounds pretty". They described the music by Hirokazu Tanaka as "sublime", and the enemy characters as "brilliantly drawn". Although they considered the blend of gameplay elements from different genres a success, they said that Kid Icarus suffered from "frustrating" design flaws, such as its high difficulty level.[39] Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com expressed their disagreement with the game's status as an "unfairly forgotten masterpiece" among its substantial Internet following. They found Kid Icarus to be "underwhelming", "buggy" and "pretty annoying", and noted that it exhibited "shrill music[, ...] loose controls and some weird design decisions". Notwithstanding their disapproval of these elements, Parish said that the game was "[not] terrible, or even bad – just a little lacking." They recommended players to buy the Virtual Console version, if only because it allowed them to experience Kid Icarus "with a fresh perspective".[40] GameSpot's Frank Provo reviewed the Virtual Console version of the game. They noted that the gameplay of Kid Icarus was "[not] the most unique blueprint for a video game", but that it had been "fairly fresh back in 1987". They considered the difficulty level "excessive", and found certain areas to be designed "solely to frustrate players". Provo said that the presentation of the game had "[not] aged gracefully". Despite their favorable comments on the Grecian scenery, they criticized the graphics for its small, bicolored and barely animated sprites, its black backgrounds, and the absence of multiple scrolling layers. They thought that the music was "nicely composed", but that the sound effects were "all taps and thuds". They were dissatisfied with the emulation of the game, as the Virtual Console release preserves the slowdown problems of the original NES version, but has its cheat codes removed. Provo closed their review with a warning for potential buyers: they said that players could appreciate Kid Icarus for its "straightforward gameplay and challenging level layouts", but might "find nothing special in the gameplay and recoil in horror at the unflinching difficulty."[7] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted that the game design was "odd" and "not Nintendo's most focused". They thought that it had "[not] aged in as timeless a manner as many other first-party Nintendo games from the NES era," and described Kid Icarus as "one of those games that made a lot more sense back in the '80s, accompanied by a tips and tricks strategy sheet." They complimented the theme music, which they considered "heroic and memorable".[15] In their review of the Virtual Console release, Thomas frowned upon Nintendo's decision to remove the NES cheat codes, and called the omission "nonsensical". They found it to be "not an issue worthy of a prolonged rant", but said that "[Nintendo has] willfully edited its product, and damaged its nostalgic value in the process".[28] Kid Icarus was included in IGN's lists of the top 100 NES games and the top 100 games of all time; it came in 20th and 84th place, respectively.[6][41] The game was inducted into GameSpy's "Hall of Fame", and was voted 54th place in Nintendo Power's top 200 Nintendo games.[8][42] Nintendo Power also listed it as the 20th best NES video game, and praised it for its "unique vertically scrolling stages, fun platforming, and infectious 8-bit tunes", in spite of its "unmerciful difficulty".[43]

John Podesta: Social Media Companies Should Police Fake News
The former failed campaign manager for Hillary Clinton recently urged social media companies to censor “fake news”.
“I think that again the social media companies have a responsibility to try to do a better job of knocking off fake sites and be able to police to some extent the propagation of fake news,” Podesta said on a far Left podcast.
Via Breitbart:
Podesta said that the propagation of “fake news” was a national security threat, complaining that “Russian bots and trolls” helped spread negative stories about Hillary Clinton across the Internet. They complained that “alt-right sites” on the internet were “peddling” the worst kind of fake news online. But they admitted that it might be impossible to fully police content on social media, a “problem” that would have to fought within the American democracy. “You can't just ignore it … you have to deal with it and come to terms with it,” they said, offering advice for future Democratic candidates.
Control freaks like Podesta will always be the enemy of free speech and press. They then went on to make excuses for the presidential campaign blunder, saying that the Hillary campaign didn't utilize social media outlets as effectively as President Trump's did: “I think in our campaign we didn't do enough persuasion through social media channels, I think we relied overwhelmingly on television for persuasion and used social media largely to talk to our own supporters and activists.”
Essentially, Podesta regrets that they didn't spread enough fake news themselves to win Hillary Clinton the White House, and is now lashing out by projecting their failures onto Republicans and Real News websites.

The Israeli Prime Minister claims Iran is behind the Bulgarian airport bus bombing which killed seven people and injured dozens more.
The newspaper says seven people were killed in the bombing; five of them Israeli tourists, one of them the Bulgarian bus driver. Authorities estimate that the seventh person who died on board may have been the terrorist who perpetrated the attack. An additional 33 Israelis were wounded in the blast.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters that "Iran is responsible for the terror attack in Bulgaria, we will have a strong response against Iranian terror." Defense Minister Ehud Barak also said Iran, Hezbollah or Hamas could be behind the attack.
Hezbollah, however, has denied any involvement in the deadly blast. A representative of the organization told Lebanese daily An-Nashra that Israeli accusations are "laughable".
"Our movement does not fight against tourists", said the Hezbollah member.
The explosion occurred outside the arrivals terminal in Burgas Airport shortly after the victims arrived via a charter flight from Tel Aviv, with 154 people including eight children.
Tourists had boarded three buses, but had not even left the parking lot when one of the buses exploded and two others subsequently caught fire. According to eyewitnesses quoted by Israeli media, some victims were on fire as they tried to escape the flames.
According to the latest reports from the Bulgarian Interior Ministry, the country's security services have established it was a suicide bomber.
"We have established a person who was a suicide bomber in this attack. This person had a fake driving license from the United States,"
Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetanov told reporters at the airport of Burgas.
Tsvetanov said security services had managed to obtain DNA samples from the fingers of the bomber and were now checking databases in an attempt to identify him.
Earlier Burgas Mayor Dimitar Nikolov told local media the explosives were placed in the trunk of the bus.
Earlier, some people who witnessed the explosion claimed it happened immediately after someone climbed on board. The mother of one of the tourists who was on the bus said their daughter called them in a panic.
“She sustained cuts and was bleeding, they removed them through the window of the bus. They were hysterical, and is there without a cell phone, so they could not say much.”
The airport in Burgas has been closed, and all flights are being redirected to Varna.
Israeli officials had previously said that Bulgaria, a popular holiday destination for Israeli tourists, was vulnerable to attack by Islamist militants who could infiltrate via nearby Turkey. Local media reported in January that extra police and army troops had been assigned to provide higher levels of security at the Sunny Beach resort, which is very popular with Israelis.
However, several internet sites in Bulgaria reported that government authorities ignored warnings and alerts by Israeli and Russian sources over a possible attack.
Exactly 18 years ago to the day, far-right political organization Hezbollah targeted the Jewish Center in Buenos Aires. As a result, 86 people died in the blast on July 18th 1994.

COMMUNITY RECORDS VEGGIE OIL VAN
This vehicle has been our dream for a long while now. Community Records functions on the wavelength of collaboration. We are an open door to new / positive ideas and participation from friends. We love touring and consider it an essential part of our lives and our music. We also have a difficult time affording to tour (as we think a lot of D.I.Y. bands do). It also pains my heart to think that almost every dollar we “earn” from donations and money from the door out on the road goes directly into the pocket of a person and group of people that we want nothing to do with.
Fossil fuels are detrimental on every level. This van is not a final solution to the problem for us, but is a big step in the right direction. Having the ability to obtain “free” renewable fuel for our vehicle will give us the freedom to travel more frequently. We will also have a less heavy of a burden on our finances. The aim of this project is to do this right, and convert the vehicle to be able to function for years to come.
////////////////////////////////
update.....
Everyone who donates or who has donated at the $20 or above level will receive a link to listen to and download a LIVE recording of ALL PEOPLE IN 3-D REGGAE DUB. & ALL PEOPLE - COMMUNICATE
all people in 3-d dub (one night only)
all people - communicate - get the download before it is released
On Friday November 16th of 2012 All People performed a full 40 minute set of atmospheric DUB REGGAE at the 3 year anniversary of the coffee clubhouse known as HEY CAFE. 20 minutes of that set was recorded by our friends Ross & Devin. You can hear / download that live recording along with your donation of $20 or above. TURN IT LOUD <3. You will also get a link to download our debut album COMMUNICATE before the release of it on Tuesday Jan. 29th.
////////////////////////////////////////
Everyone who donates at the $35 or above level will get the all people in 3-D dub + exclusive downloads of both CADDYWHOMPUS & ALL PEOPLE - NEVER RECORDS SESSIONS
caddywhompus - "layers" exclusive - never records session
all people - "precedent" - exclusive never records session
Both Caddywhompus & All People recorded NEW MATERIAL at the never records recording project that was hosted in New Orleans in October 2012. What came of the project were rare tracks were cut to a vinyl. Only 2 of each of this vinyl exist in the world. At the $35 donation level, along with your other rewards you will have access to download the high quality MP3s that came from this session.
////////////////////////////////////////
The kickstarter goal of $7,500 is about the halfway mark of what we need to make this vehicle a reality. We have collected about $6,000 in our personal savings, and we are asking you to help us get the rest of the way. Together we will make this dream a reality.
The conversion (with the way we want to do this) will cost about $5,000. The van itself will cost between $7,000 - $10,000. We also want to eventually purchase a trailer. So the whole project will cost us roughly between $13,000 and $15,500 with van/ trailer/ conversion and all. This van overtime will be made accessible to and be used by all of the community records artists. The idea is to have a functional vehicle for the long term.
We have done our research. We are going to work with a company called GOLDEN FUELS who have had years of experience converting diesel engine vans to run on waste vegetable oil. We have also met with a band called THE RAGBIRDS (from Michigan) who are successfully doing this in the way that we want to. They have toured for 4 years this way traveled 150,000 miles and saved roughly $50,000 in fuel costs. As for The Ragbirds experience and suggestion, we want to get a van built with a Ford diesel 7.3 liter powerstroke engine (one of the best for this type of conversion). We will put in a two tank filtration system, and maintain this vehicle with proper attention and care.
Overtime if we network properly we can build a collective of friends across the country that can help us to obtain quality waste vegetable oil (from restaurants who fry anything, even fast food places). We will make our way across the country time and time again with only minimal reliance on fossil fuels and minimal contribution the numerous negative effects of its use.
COMMUNITY RECORDS VEGGIE OIL VAN (by Otto Splotch)
We have some really fun rewards that you can get for helping us to achieve this. We had our friend OTTO SPLOTCH (artist of the dog logo, all 3 compilations, head above water compilation, and dogzilla design) draw up a mad-max style drawing of our beloved dog driving a van made of corn. Link to photo here. You can win a poster or shirt with this art on it. If we get enough money raised here we will even get a vehicle window decal with this art and the community records logo on it.
Everyone who donates over $10 gets their name handwritten into the interior of this van and printed on the back of the shirt that will be made in association with this. We are also planning the COMMUNITY RECORDS 2013 SUMMER TOUR (with CADDYWHOMPUS & ALL PEOPLE) as the first of hopefully many many tours in this van. Though this kickstarter you can book the tour anywhere across the United States or come on tour with us.
There is plenty of other rad stuff too and if you have any questions at all about any of it before donating, please send us a message on here and ask away. You can also e-mail us at: communityrecords( at ) gmail.com. We will do our best to respond quickly.
This project is only possible if we meet this $7,500 goal that we have set. We know this is a lot of money. We also know that not everyone has extra funds to spare. So no matter what, thank you for reading this, thank you for being here, and thank you for your support. We appreciate any and all help that comes our way.
Peace.

The U.S. aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, whose home port is San Diego, has been ordered repositioned away from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant after low levels of radiation were detected in the air and flight deck, Navy officials said Monday.
Photos: Scenes of earthquake destruction in Japan
The maximum amount of radiation that crew members aboard the ship may have been exposed to was equal to that which someone might be exposed to during a month by natural sources, officials said.
The Reagan was operating about 100 miles northeast of the crippled plant as part of the U.S. humanitarian mission to the country, which was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami.
Videos: Fukushima nuclear plant explosion
Low levels of radiation were detected among 17 crew members of helicopters ferrying supplies to the island. The contamination was "easily removed by washing with soap and water," officials said.
Still, the Reagan and two other San Diego ships, the Preble and the Chancellorsville, were ordered to move out the downwind direction from the nuclear plant and any leaking radioactivity. The U.S. remains committed to the relief mission, officials said.

Taylor Swift-related Twitter drama is alive and well again, though it's not Swift who's instigating this time. Depending on where your pop allegiances lie the agitator is either Zayn Malik, formerly of One Direction, or DJ-producer Calvin Harris, who is dating Swift.
It all started when Malik retweeted a tweet from the account @FemaleTexts that negatively compares Swift to fellow pop star Miley Cyrus. The tweet includes a screenshot of an interview with TIME in which Swift says fans disappointed by their withdrawal from Spotify can still get their music on iTunes. It also includes a quote from Cyrus explaining that they have already “made [her] money” and that they don't care if “no one buys [her] album,” along with a description of Cyrus's Happy Hippie Foundation, which benefits LGBT youth. The tweet concludes, “The difference is astounding.”
But Calvin Harris was not about to let a former boy-bander imply via the medium of retweet that their girlfriend is only in it for the money. So they fired back to Malik explaining that Swift's business decision wasn't about their personal wealth, but about what's fair for other musicians trying to earn a living in a series of strongly-worded tweets:
Then Malik responded to Harris' response with some choice words of their own…
…before Harris tried to put an end to it.

Nick Heidfeld could be on their way out of Formula One after Mercedes revealed they were talking to potential candidates about their reserve driver role.
Heidfeld started last season with the German team as test driver before joining Sauber in September to replace Pedro de la Rosa for the final five races of the season.
But with Sauber naming Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Perez as their driver line-up for 2011, Heidfeld's future in F1 remains in doubt once again.
Head of marketing Joachim Schmidt admitted they were not looking to appoint a German test driver - with Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher already confirmed as their line-up for the new season.
"We already have two German drivers," Schmidt told the Bietigheimer Zeitung newspaper. "At the moment we are in conversation with potential candidates."

During President Obama's State of the Union address earlier this year, they boasted about the effectiveness of Western sanctions against Russia, claiming that the Eastern European nation's economy was “in tatters.”
The president certainly had incentive to pump up the sanctions they helped enact. But at a panel discussion on the future of the Russian economy on Wednesday at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Russia experts and investors in the Russian economy vehemently disagreed with their analysis.
Panelists argued that the Russian recession is largely a result of a collapse in oil prices rather than Western sanctions. Meanwhile, the ruble has stabilized after falling sharply last year and the Russian stock market has recovered more than 20% in 2015.
Billionaire investor David Bonderman argued that Western sanctions, though much lighter than those imposed on countries like Iran, are actually creating opportunities for investment in Russia. “The market has fallen a long way, and there's a shortage of capital,” they said. “Returns tend to be higher where either the troops are in the street or prices are low.”
Retailers like Russian supermarket Lenta, which Bonderman has a stake in, are seeing higher margins absent Western competition, and demand for staples like groceries remain strong. Russian-born investment banker Ruben Vardanyan pointed out that the collapse of the ruble left much of the economy untouched, with roughly 90% of the population not inclined to buy imported goods. And that population, Vardanyan points out, has only increased its support for Vladimir Putin in the months following the imposition of sanctions.
The panel uniformly condemned U.S. policy towards Russia as ineffective and short-sighted. Susan Eisenhower, chairperson and CEO of The Eisenhower Group, a consulting firm, argued that isolating Russia, even as a punishment for breaking international law, “isn't in the United States' interest.” They pointed to the increased risk of nuclear weapons proliferation in a world where the United States and Russia aren't communicating.
Eisenhower argued for a reset of U.S.-Russia relations, first by appointing a special envoy to Russia to restart a dialogue that can help resolve the dispute over Crimea.
Bonderman said that U.S. policy towards Russia is simply pushing the country into the arms of China, a relationship they argued is counter to the desires of the Russian people and the interests of the United States. “The Russian people want to be Western; to force them to the east is unnatural,” they said.
To be sure, investors in Russia, like those who sat on the panel at the Milken Conference, would benefit from a lifting of sanctions. But the surge in Russian markets and Putin's popularity suggests that the Russian economy isn't as bad as we thought.
While supercomputer maker Silicon Graphics was showing off its existing Altix lines of Xeon and Itanium servers at the SC08 supercomputing show in Austin, Texas, this week, the most interesting thing the company touted was not yet a real computer, but a concept system, called Molecule.
The Molecule machine takes a few pages out of IBM's BlueGene massively parallel supercomputer book, and the main one is that for some workloads, where a large number of compute nodes need to be brought to bear to run a simulation, sometimes it makes more sense to have relatively modest processors instead of big fat ones.
IBM built the BlueGene/L super from its embedded PowerPC 440 dual-core processors. SGI's Molecule concept machine would be built from Intel dual-core Atom x64 chips, which are based on 45 nanometer processes and are designed for netbooks and other portable computing devices where long battery life, not computing power, is the limit of usefulness. The chips run at between 800 MHz and 1.67 GHz and implement HyperThreading, so they can deliver up to two virtual threads per core.
With the BlueGene box, IBM controlled not only the chip but also the interface off the chip and out into the system interconnect. Michael Brown, sciences segment manager at SGI who was showing off the Molecule concept box, says that SGI can't really control the interconnect Intel will put on Atom boards. But presumably a fast enough interconnect could be designed to plug multiple Atom boards into a chassis.
The Molecule concept machine puts a dual-core Atom N330, code-named "Diamondville," on a system board that is about the size of a credit card. This particular chip runs at 1.6 GHz and has a thermal design point of about 8 watts. The Atom N330 is not a true dual-core chip, but rather two single-core Atoms side-by-side in a single chip package (it really isn't even a socket) that is mounted to the board. Brown said that the future "Lincroft" iteration of the Atom chip, which will put a DDR2 memory controller on the chip, and thereby eliminate the need for an external chipset since the Molecule boards have no direct attached storage other than main memory, would be an interesting possibility. But Brown made no commitments to SGI actually using this chip.
In any event, the Molecule board had four memory DIMMs soldered directly to the board and linked to the chip, which provided 2 GB of memory capacity. The interconnect is along the side of the board as the memory chips, and would plug into a backplane of some sort that would reach out to external storage and networks, much as blade servers do inside their chassis.
The Molecule design glues two of these Atom boards to a hollow ceramic cartridge that is used to hold the boards in place, to draw heat off the boards, and to channel cooling air that comes in through the bottom of the chassis and is diverted at a 90-degree angle out the back of the chassis. The cartridges interlace to create a bunch of channels, and have fins and baffles inside to direct airflow very precisely. SGI calls this Atom board packaging Kelvin.
Kelvin, lording over the Atoms in the Molecule
The concept machine at the SC08 show was a 3U rack that contained 180 of the Atom boards, for a total of 360 cores. These boards would present 720 virtual threads to a clustered application, and have 720 GB of main memory (using 512 MB DDR2 DIMMs mounted on the board) and a total of 720 GB/sec of memory bandwidth. The important thing to realize, explained Brown, is that if the interconnect was architected correctly, the entire memory inside the chassis could be searched in one second. That memory bandwidth, Brown explained, was up to 15 TB/sec per rack, or about 20 times that of a single-rack cluster these days. This setup would be good for applications where cache memory or out-of-order execution don't help, but massive amounts of threads do help. (Search, computational fluid dynamics, seismic processing, stochastic modeling, and others were mentioned).
The other advantages that the Molecule system might have are low energy use and low cost. The aggregate memory bandwidth in a rack of these machines (that's 10,080 cores with 9.8 TB of memory) would deliver about 7 times the GB per second per watt of a rack of x64 servers in a cluster today, according to Brown. On applications where threads rule, the Molecule would do about 7 times the performance per watt of x64 servers, and on SPEC-style floating point tests, it might even deliver twice the performance per watt. On average, SGI is saying performance per watt should be around 3.5 times that of a rack of x64 servers.
One more thing: It has no moving parts, and that increases reliability. And if storage needs to be added to the Molecule architecture, it will be flash memory.
The Molecule aims to run off-the-shelf HPC applications on top of Linux or Windows. Brown said that SGI was showing off the concept box to solicit input from prospective customers even before it creates an alpha box. If SGI sees enough interest, it could take 12 to 18 months to produce the concept. If the idea is sound, let's hope it doesn't take that long. ®
In Southern States, Immigration Law Battle Rages On
toggle caption John Bazemore/AP
Last year, several states passed strict laws aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration. Those laws are now being challenged in federal court, and next month the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Arizona's immigration law — but that hasn't stopped some Southern states from moving forward with more restrictions.
In 2011, Georgia passed a sweeping anti-immigration measure that requires law enforcement officers to check the status of people they suspect are in the country illegally and forces employers to verify the immigration status of workers. Now, lawmakers have been debating a bill to ban students here illegally from attending all public colleges — and that has drawn criticism.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Erik S. Lesser/EPA/Landov Erik S. Lesser/EPA/Landov
Democratic state Sen. Nan Orrock addressed the bill at a recent rally held at the Georgia Capitol.
Before a vote last night, a House committee took out the provision that would have banned illegal immigrants from colleges. D.A. King helped write the Georgia immigration law, and they say the intent of the bill is to update the identification requirements for people to prove they are here legally.
"But also to stop the acceptance of undocumented passports or passports issued to people in the country illegally after they arrive in the United States," King says. "That will do a lot to keep illegal aliens uncomfortable in the state of Georgia which has been our goal since we started."
Some suggest the move to forbid immigrants from using foreign passports to prove their identity will affect thousands of legal immigrants and foreign tourists. The ACLU's Jonathon Blazer says the regulation makes it difficult for this group to use basic services.
"It includes access to municipal buildings, marriage licenses, water [and] sewage services," Blazer says. "And these are the kind of unintended — if they are unintended — consequences that arise when states try to dabble in this area."
The Arizona Effect In 2010, Arizona passed a law that made it a state crime to be in the country illegally and required police to check the immigration status of anyone they stopped. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of that law this summer, but in the meantime, several other states have followed its example.

Utah States That Introduced Arizona-Inspired Immigration Bills In 2012
Kansas
Missouri
Mississippi
Tennessee
West Virginia Source: National Conference of State Legislatures
Alabama is moving forward with efforts to clarify its immigration law, which is in the courts, and the Mississippi House recently passed a bill calling for police to check the immigration status of those who are arrested. During a fiery debate over the bill, Mississippi state Rep. Andy Gipson, a Republican, said the measure is not unjust.
"Any person in Mississippi who breaks our laws and is arrested for doing so can be asked to present proof that they're here legally," Gipson said. "I don't think that's asking too much."
But state Rep. Ed Blackmon, a Democrat, is among those who oppose the bill.
"There's no compassion in this," they responded. "There's no forgiveness in this. We are going to bring down the hammer on a group of people who only want to do one thing: Find a better life for themselves."
Meanwhile, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has continued to support immigration laws, saying the states are justified in passing them.
"I think we took some of the most offensive language out ... so I think we have a really good, fair law," they say.
This year, Southeastern states have provided much of the debate on the immigration issue. Some, like Georgia and Alabama, are revamping laws. But bills in Tennessee, Arkansas and Virginia are on hold at least until this summer, when the Supreme Court is expected to rule on Arizona's law.
Arizona hated surprises. Everyone in the hospital knew that from the last time Callie had tried to throw them a birthday party. They never turned out well and she'd much rather just spend their birthday with the people who were most important to them
Only, this year they had no one. Sophia was on the other side of the country and Arizona was still hopelessly single. She'd thought about just going to their favourite lesbian bar and getting drunk out of their mind, but that seemed even more pathetic than sitting at home alone.
So instead they found themselves sitting on the couch with an entire pizza, drinking wine, rewatching The L Word and feeling sorry for herself.
She'd just gotten comfortable when the doorbell rang. Grumbling to herself, they grabbed their crutches and made their way to the door. If it was someone trying to talk to them about Jesus, they decided they were going to help them meet them sooner rather than later. Fortunately, they were saved from having to kill anyone when they swung the door open to reveal Amelia.
"Um, hi?" Amelia began, suddenly feeling like they were intruding and wondering why they had a even come at all. When Arizona didn't move or respond, Amelia put on the most enthusiastic smile they could muster and held out the box they had just remembered they were holding. "Happy birthday!"
"Uh, thanks. Would you like to come in for a bit?" Arizona asked, realising that they were being rude to the only person in the hospital who seemed to have remembered them birthday.
"I don't want to impose-" Amelia began before Arizona cut them off.
"No!" The blonde said, perhaps too vehemently. "I mean, no, you wouldn't be imposing at all."
"Ok," Amelia replied as Arizona moved out of the doorway so they could pass. They followed the blonde through to the living room and they sat on at opposite ends of the couch with the pizza between them. Amelia realised that they hadn't really thought this far ahead into their plan and had absolutely no idea what to say next.
"How did you know it was my birthday?" Arizona inquired, really hoping Callie had organised this as some sort of pity thing.
"Oh, I heard you mention it today?" Amelia offered, feeling awkward. Arizona stared at them in confusion. They were pretty sure they hadn't mentioned their birthday to anyone. "After surgery?"
Amelia hadn't anticipated being the only person in the hospital to know it was Arizona's birthday. She'd overheard the blonde mumbling to themselves after they'd lost both the mum and baby in surgery today, saying "why couldn't my birthday just go smoothly?"
"Oh," Arizona simply replied, looking down at my hands.
"Sorry, I didn't realise you didn't want people knowing it was your birthday," Amelia apologised. "It's just, I thought it was kind of a crappy thing to happen on your birthday so I thought I'd buy you some donuts because, hey, what are friends for? Not that we're really friends, but we could be. I mean, you're really nice and you're gorgeous- not that I'm only friends with people who are good looking. I mean, you should see my friend Sheldon, they literally look like a turtle. I just thought maybe we could be friends? Because I don't really seem to have that many friends right now."
Arizona couldn't help but smile as the other woman rambled, blushing lightly when Amelia complimented them
"Well you're the only one to buy me something for my birthday so, you're the best friend I've got at the moment," Arizona reassured the brunette. "Help yourself to some pizza."
Amelia grabbed a slice eagerly, shoving it into their mouth in an effort to stop themselves from rambling again.
"Do you want to watch something?" Arizona asked, holding the remote out to them guest.
"Uh, whatever you were watching is fine with me," Amelia said, looking towards the TV, which was paused on two women kissing.
"It's The L Word," Arizona said shyly. They were an out and proud lesbian but somehow getting caught watching a lesbian TV show made them feel like she'd been caught watching porn or something.
"That's fine," Amelia chuckled, taking another slice of pizza as Arizona pressed play on the episode. "Oh, I love this episode!"
"Wait, you've seen The L Word?" Arizona said, pausing the episode again and turning to look incredulously at Amelia.
"Um, it's a good show?" Amelia lamely offered.
"No it's not," Arizona bluntly replied.
"Yeah, you're right, it really isn't," Amelia agreed with a nervous laugh. "A friend sort of got me hooked on it."
Arizona looked at them pointedly, not buying that any straight woman could have a 'favourite episode' of the The L Word.
"Shut up and watch your damn show," Amelia laughed, throwing a cushion at the blonde.
"First you call me gorgeous, then you have a favourite episode of The L Word, and now you're trying to avoid the subject? Three strikes and you're gay, Shepherd," Arizona retorted, laughing as the other woman blushed and avoided eye contact.
"Anyone with eyes can see that you're gorgeous. So really it's more, two strikes and I'm bi," Amelia replied with a wink, causing the blonde to blush. Arizona wasn't really sure what to say, or think, or do. Drinking half a bottle of wine before the pizza even arrived had severely impaired their brain's processing time apparently.
"Earth to Arizona?" Amelia said, waving their hand in front of the blonde's face. They hadn't come out to many people but this was not exactly the reaction she'd been expecting.
Amelia's hand broke Arizona out of their trance and when their eyes focused again, all they could see was Amelia's lips. They would admit she'd developed somewhat of a crush on the other woman while they'd been working on Herman's case. Amelia was hot, confident and an absolute genius. Arizona would've been crazy not to be interested in her, but there were more pressing matters at hand, like learning an entire specialty in just a few months.
"You're gorgeous too," Arizona finally managed to blurt out, snapping their eyes up to meet Amelia's.
"I'm glad someone thinks so," Amelia laughed, not fully believing Arizona's words. Owen was so self-absorbed and emotionally distant they wondered if he'd be better off with a sex doll.
"You're beautiful. And anyone who doesn't think so is an idiot," Arizona said in what they hoped was a reassuring way, but Amelia looked down at their hands, no longer laughing.
Moving the pizza off of the couch, Arizona slid across so that they could wrap their arms around the other woman. 'God, they smell good,' they thought as they breathed deeply, inhaling the brunette's perfume.
"You're so beautiful. But you're also smart and funny and you smell nice and you're my best friend!" Amelia couldn't help but laugh at that.
"I'm only your best friend because I bought you donuts," Amelia reminded them
"And because you're here with me, on my birthday and we're sharing secrets now so we're definitely best friends," Arizona informed them
"You haven't shared any of your secrets."
"Ok, well. Secretly, I really want to kiss you right now," Arizona says. They know she's being sort of ridiculous and immature right now, and that Amelia has a sort of boyfriend/sex-friend/whatever thing with Owen, but it was their birthday and they were sort of tipsy so they decided they were allowed. Plus, what did they have to lose?
Amelia's eyes darted down to Arizona's lips as their tongue darted out to lick their own. Their faces were inches apart and Amelia leant forward, capturing Arizona's lips with them own.
At first, Arizona was shocked that Amelia was even kissing them Then they were shocked that Amelia was still kissing them Eventually their brain caught up to their mouth and they were kissing back. The kiss was heated, Amelia had one hand entwined in blonde hair, while Arizona's hands were on Amelia's waist. Amelia's hand slipped to Arizona's shoulder and they gently pushed the blonde back so they were lying lengthways on the couch. Climbing on top, Amelia pressed their body against Arizona's, slipping one of their legs between Arizona's thighs.
"Fuck," Arizona gasped, as Amelia's leg pressed against their clit. Amelia quickly recaptured their mouth in a kiss before slipping one hand up Arizona's shirt. Arizona made quick work of removing Amelia's shirt and bra before breaking contact with Amelia's mouth and instead taking one of the brunette's nipples in their mouth, flicking it with their tongue and gentle dragging their teeth across it. Amelia began to grind themselves against Arizona's thigh, as Arizona lightly trailed their fingertips over the brunette's abdomen, letting them dip just below the waistband of Amelia's jeans. As Amelia removed Arizona's shirt and bra, Arizona undid the jeans and slipped their hand inside, surprised to find Amelia wasn't wearing any underwear. Instead, their hand almost instantly came into contact with the slick wetness of Amelia's centre as they pressed their fingers against it, causing Amelia's hips to buck into them They began circling Amelia's clit, leaning up again to capture the brunette's lips and kissing them hard before slipping their tongue into the other woman's mouth.
As Amelia's thrusts became more urgent, Arizona slipped two fingers inside of her, already feeling the brunette clench around them They began flicking Amelia's clit with their thumb as their finger hit the other woman's G-Spot and soon, Amelia let out a loud moan and clenched tightly around Arizona's fingers.
After Amelia had caught their breath again, they leant down to kiss the blonde once more, this time much softer.
"Wow. It's been a while since I've been fucked like that," Amelia told them
"It's been a while since I've been fucked at all," Arizona laughed.
"Oh, don't worry. I will take care of that. It is your birthday after all," Amelia reassured her, leaning in towards their ear as they spoke and gently biting Arizona's earlobe.
Slowly, they kissed their way down Arizona's neck and over their breasts, stopping to suck each nipple slowly, gently taking each on between their teeth and flicking them with their tongue. They kissed their way over, Arizona's abdomen, causing goosebumps to erupt beneath their lips, before finally slipping the blonde's pants and underwear down and off of their legs in one smooth motion.
Amelia positioned themselves between Arizona's thighs, eagerly running their tongue slowly up the blonde's slit. They let the tip of their tongue find Arizona's clit and began to flick it with their tongue, sporadically sucking on the bundle of nerves or allowing their teeth to drag over it. Soon, Arizona was thrusting up into their mouth and Amelia slipped their tongue inside of the other woman, tasting them arousal. They felt Arizona's orgasm building as the blonde clenched around their tongue and as they heard the other woman moan their name, they slipped two fingers inside, continuing to suck at Arizona's clit as the blonde came not once, but twice.
As Arizona let their body recover and their muscles relax, Amelia crawled back up, kissing them and letting them taste herself.
"Happy birthday," Amelia whispered in their ear. "Why don't we move this to the bedroom for round two?"
TL;DR
Sometimes System.Collections.Concurrent provide not enough methods to squeeze the top performance out of them. Below you can find a small extension method that will make your life easier in some cases
Concurrent dictionary
The concurrent dictionary provides a lot of useful methods. You can TryAdd, AddOrUpdate. Additionally, you can use TryUpdate which provides a very nice method for ensuring optimistic concurrency. Let's take a look at its signature:
public bool TryUpdate(TKey key, TValue newValue, TValue comparisonValue)
It enables to replace a value under a specific key with the newValue only if the previous value is equal to comparisonValue. It's an extremely powerful API. If you create a new object for a specific key to update it, it enables to replace that object without locks with a single method call. Of course, if the method fails, it returns false and it's up to you to retry.
What about deletes? What if I wanted to remove an entry only if nobody changed it's value in the meantime? What if I wanted to have an optimistic concurrency for deletes as well. Is there a method for it? Unfortunately no. The only method for removal is
public bool TryRemove(TKey key, out TValue value)
which removes the value unconditionally returning it. This breaks the optimistic concurrency as we can't ensure that the removed entry wasn't modified. What can be done to make it conditional?
Explicit interfaces
The ConcurrentDictionary class implements a lot of interfaces, one of them is
ICollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>
This interface has one particular method, enabling to remove a pair of values.
ICollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>.Remove(KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> kvp
If you take a look into implementation, it uses a private method of the dictionary to remove the key only if the value is equal to the value of the pair. Now we can write a simple extension method to provide a conditional, optimistically concurrent removal of a key
static class ConcurrentDictionaryExtensions { public static bool TryRemoveConditionally<TKey, TValue>( this ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue> dictionary, TKey key, TValue previousValueToCompare) { var collection = (ICollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>)dictionary; var toRemove = new KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>(key, previousValueToCompare); return collection.Remove(toRemove); } }
which closes the gap and makes the API of the concurrent dictionary support all the operations under optimistic concurrency.
Summary
With this simple tweak you can use a concurrent dictionary as a collection that supports fully an optimistic concurrency.
Adelaide's Kyle Cheney faces a warning from the AFL's integrity unit after the former Hawk admitted they were joking when they said the Crows had received inside information from former Bulldog Michael Talia before one of this year's elimination finals.
While the AFL investigation into the Talia brothers and the alleged leaking of match information has cleared all parties, there is widespread disenchantment over the league's handling of the findings and its heavy-handed treatment of the Talias.

Cheney, who sparked the investigation when they told former teammate Ben Stratton that the Crows had received information regarding the Bulldogs' forward set-up, admitted under intense questioning from AFL investigators that they had not been serious.
This was despite Cheney earlier telling Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge that their comments to Stratton were accurate. Stratton later passed on that information which finished up with the Bulldogs.
Arthur Masuaku says Hammers want to avenge their home defeat by Watford at Vicarage Road
West Ham United went 2-0 up before imploding at London Stadium
Left-back is fit again after a period on the sidelines with a knee injury
Arthur Masuaku is hoping to gain revenge over Watford and help West Ham United get back on the winning trail when they return to Premier League action on Saturday.
Masuaku is ready to win back their place in the squad after recovering from a knee ligament injury and wants to make amends for the disappointing home defeat by Watford back in September.
West Ham dominated the opening 40 minutes and raced into a two-goal lead after Michail Antonio netted a brace and looked the strong favourites to secure all three points.
But the Hammers suffered a bad end to the first half when they conceded two goals in the final five minutes and ended up losing 4-2.
Masuaku played in that game and says their team-mates will have a major point to prove when they line up at Vicarage Road this weekend.
They said: “We want to get revenge on Saturday. I remember the game and we played so well in the first 40 minutes and should have killed the game off.
“I don't know how we lost but we want to make amends for that defeat and hopefully we can win on Saturday.
“We were unlucky not to get the three points in the last game against West Brom and we could have got the victory if certain decisions had not gone against us. Hopefully we will have more luck in the next game.”
I don't know how we lost but we want to make amends for that defeat and hopefully we can win on Saturday Arthur Masuaku
While Watford will form the opposition at Vicarage Road, the former Olympiacos star will see a friendly face in a yellow shirt - their former France U19 team-mate Abdoulaye Doucoure.
The duo have remained good friends and the French full-back hopes they can earn the bragging rights over the Watford midfielder at the final whistle.
Masuaku added: “We played together for the France U19s.  They are a very good player and a nice guy as well. When they came to Watford they didn't feature at the beginning but they are now starting to play and I am very happy for him. They have adapted well to the Premier League.
“He is my friend, but when we play on Saturday we will not be friends!”
West Ham's Premier League fixture at Watford will be screened live by BT Sport at 5.30pm on Saturday 25 February.
One of the many disturbing facts that have come to light in the weeks since Michael Brown was killed by a police officer is that for all the crime data tracked by the government, there is no central record kept of law enforcement use of deadly force. Individuals and groups have been making their own databases, but a citizen would need to file open records requests to learn about their or their community.
You may have asked yourself, “Was Michael Brown's killing lawful? And could an unlawful shooting happen in my hometown?”
Well, good news, if you live in Houston. The Texas Observer has looked at the numbers and the answer is, no. Your police force cannot wrongly shoot you.
It just doesn't happen. Well, deadly police shootings do happen in Houston at an average of one every three weeks. But none of them is inappropriate. Every shooting by a Houston Police Department officer is investigated by HPD's Internal Affairs and Homicide divisions. Between 2007 and 2012, according to HPD records, officers killed citizens in 109 shootings. Every killing was ruled justified.
The 112 instances of an officer shooting and injuring a person were justified, too.
So were the 104 times an officer wounded an animal, and the 225 times an officer killed an animal.
There were 16 shootings found “not justified,” but they were all ruled accidental.
In more than one in five cases in which officers fired on citizens, the citizen was unarmed.
Skeptics might say those numbers show police bias in holding their own accountable. I would direct these skeptics to the grand jury system.
Harris County grand juries have cleared HPD officers for on-duty shootings almost 300 times in a row. No Houston officer has been indicted for a shooting in a decade.
Don't you feel better?
Now, the Houston Chronicle's Lisa Falkenberg recently reported on a Houston cop who bullied and threatened a witness while serving as supervisor for a grand jury investigating the killing of a Houston cop. And this man had served on at least nine other grand juries. But that's probably an isolated case.
Besides the grand jury system, there are other safeguards against misuse of police power in Houston. There's the Independent Police Oversight Board, which consists of four panels of citizens that divvy up and review HPD's Internal Affairs investigations. The panels don't have subpoena power; they can't do their own investigations; they can't interview witnesses; they can't force anything to happen. But they can suggest that Internal Affairs do a more thorough investigation or reconsider its findings. Internal Affairs doesn't have to do anything they say, but it's nice that the people have a voice.
Last week, Houston City Councilman C.O. Bradford, a former HPD chief wrote an editorial in the Chronicle saying Michael Brown's killing was “a wake-up call for Houston” and noted that the Independent Police Oversight Board was “without substantive authority.” Yet their solution was to let stakeholder groups like the NAACP appoint their own representatives to the authority-less board.
That's different from the idea stakeholders themselves have, which is to replace the IPOB with a citizen oversight board with subpoena power—that is, the ability to do their own investigations into shootings or alleged misconduct.
One of those stakeholders is a Houston police officer I met for coffee this week. They had read the two features I wrote on HPD shootings, beatings, and lax accountability for the Observer last year and just wanted to talk. A 20-year veteran of the department, they plan to leave the force soon. There are too many problems, and the department is so sealed, so shielded from scrutiny, they said that “It's like a Communist country. A lot of us wish we could talk but they're nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs…. Boy, I hope they get that citizen oversight board soon.”
But if we did, all that good news might go away.
WASHINGTON: The United States is expected to release $337 million to Pakistan under the Coalition Support Fund in a next few days, a US official said on Friday.
“The April-June 2014 reimbursement of $337 million of Coalition Support Fund assistance has been approved by the Secretary of Defence, and we anticipate it being released by the end of the month,” a State Department spokesperson told Dawn.

“The Coalition Support Fund is a demonstration of our commitment to supporting Pakistan's efforts to eliminate terrorist threats throughout Pakistan,” the official said. “We welcome the government of Pakistan's commitment to combat all terrorists and ensure that militant groups are not able to re-establish safe havens in Pakistan,” the spokesperson added.
Earlier this month, the Obama administration notified the US Congress about its intention to release the fund to Pakistan. The mandatory 15-day notice period expired this weekend.
Officials at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, however, clarified that the Coalition Support Fund was not military aid. “It's the reimbursement of what Pakistan spends in combating terrorists along the Afghan border,” said one official. Diplomatic observers in Washington say that the ongoing military operation in Fata has helped increase US confidence in Pakistan's plan for combating terrorists.
But a State Department official disagreed with the suggestion that this has had a negative impact on US civilian assistance to Pakistan. “The US continues to provide Pakistan with a robust civilian assistance package,” they said.
In the proposed US budget for 2016, Pakistan continues to be a top recipient of foreign assistance. It would receive $804 million in the next fiscal year, despite a 10 per cent cut from the fiscal 2014.
The 2016 budget request includes $600 million for Pakistan from the OCO (Overseas Contingency Opera­tions) funding.
“Even though we maintain a robust investment in our Pakistan assistance, that's come down by a small amount — about 10 per cent — over last year based on what we think the needs are and what we think — what we assess the capabilities are,” explained Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Heather Higginbottom.

Shots were fired at the fourth floor of a science and technology center at the University of Alabama-Huntsville sometime over the weekend, hitting windows adjacent to climatologist John Christy's office.
No one was hurt, and university police have characterized the event as a “random shooting,” UAH spokesperson Ray Garner told WHNT News. Police found “seven spent Belgian 5.7 millimeter bullet casings along Sparkman Drive” near the National Space Science and Technology Center, WHNT reported.
“My office was not hit, but the one next door and then further north had bullet impacts on the windows,” Christy told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
“Appears to be a drive-by from the trajectories from the street parallel to the building,” Christy added.
Three bullets hit windows, while four hit the side of the National Space Science and Technology Center. An incident report was filed after building staff discovered shards of glass Monday morning.
Christy is a well-respected climatologist who's spent decades using satellites to measure global temperatures.  They are considered a skeptic of human-made global warming, and environmentalists and left-leaning scientists have attacked them for challenging the credibility of climate models.
Christy's research has shown climate models massively over-predicted global warming, and he's also done extensive research into flaws with surface-based temperature readings from weather stations.
While police say the shooting looks to be random, Christy's colleague, Dr. Roy Spencer, said it's “more than coincidence” that shots were fired around Earth Day.
“Given that this was Earth Day weekend, with a March for Science passing right past our building on Saturday afternoon, I think this is more than coincidence,” wrote Spencer.
“When some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way,” Spencer wrote in their blog. “It doesn't matter that we don't ‘deny global warming;' the fact we disagree with its seriousness and the level of human involvement in warming is enough to send some radicals into a tizzy.”
“Our street is fairly quiet, so I doubt the shots were fired during Saturday's march here. It was probably late night Saturday or Sunday for the shooter to have a chance of being unnoticed,” Spencer noted.
Garner did not respond to TheDCNF's request for comment.

A op-ed columnist for The New York Times praised the numerous organizations coordinating the nationwide “resistance” to President Trump, arguing Trump has “done more to spur progressive political organizing than Bernie Sanders, George Soros and Saul Alinsky combined.”
Michelle Goldberg, a leftist columnist for The New York Times, gleefully recounted a series of “victories” earned by the nationwide resistance to President Trump, beginning with the citizens “coordinated by groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party” who “flooded congressional town halls to demand that their representatives save the Affordable Care Act.”
Despite repeated efforts by conservative Republicans in both houses of Congress, measures repealing Obamacare repeatedly failed in the Senate in the face of unanimous opposition by Democrats along with a handful of Republicans.
The closer than expected special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional district to succeed Tom Price, who had resigned to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, was fueled by “the energy of the district's previously apolitical suburban women” galvanized by their “disgust for Trump.”
Despite raising more than $23 million, Democrat Jon Ossoff was defeated by Republican Karen Handel in a loss deemed “demoralizing” by The New York Times, with Democrats “left to wonder if the intense anti-Trump passion visible in protests, marches, money and new volunteers isn't just some theatrical, symbolic, abstract thing.”
According to Goldberg, the intense anti-Trump passion is not theatrical or abstract, as “Democrats have triumphed all over the country, as Trump's approval rating keeps sinking.”
The so-called “progressive” (read Socialist) Working Families Party “endorsed 1,036 candidates in 2017” while “almost two-thirds of them won.”
“Inasmuch as Trump is able to force their agenda on an unwilling nation, it's because of a breakdown in democracy that renders many members of Congress heedless of their own constituents,” they declared.
Goldberg's suggestion does not hold weight when matched against a breakdown of the 2016 election result by Congressional district. If each Congressional district was represented by a person from the same party as the presidential candidate who won the district, Republicans would hold a majority of seats with 230, while Democrats would still be in the minority with 205 seats.
Despite the efforts of leftist organizations, their allies in the mainstream media, and the deep state to stop Trump's agenda, they have continued to make progress, much to their chagrin.
“But while Trump has given their followers the liberal tears they crave, that victory contains the seeds of its own reversal. Trump has done more to spur progressive political organizing than Bernie Sanders, George Soros and Saul Alinsky combined,” Goldberg concluded. “The president once warned that if they fell, he'd take the entire Republican Party down with him. Thanks to the Resistance, they might still have the chance.”
Dwight Howard and the Houston Rockets have played the Golden State Warriors four times this season, and have come away loser on all four occasions. You'd think Houston's defensive bell cow would have utmost respect for The Bay's team, then, but you'd be wrong. Asked after last night's 126-113 drubbing at the hands of Golden State if he'd just faced basketball's best team, Howard demurred.
Dwight Howard after the loss to the Warriors: "I think the Hawks are the best team. They got the best record, right?" — Diamond Leung (@diamond83) January 22, 2015
Pretty sly, Dwight.
Golden State's 34-6 record trumps the similarly dominant 35-8 mark of the Atlanta Hawks. Either Howard is unaware of that fact or he's simply engaging in some off-court gamesmanship – considering the source and the outright tension between the Warriors and Rockets, it's likely a combination of the two.
The teams nearly came to blows last night after Trevor Ariza took exception to an offensive foul by Steph Curry and promptly ran into the MVP candidate, sparking Curry to chase after him. If not for the cool head and strong hands of Draymond Green that held Curry back, it really seemed like they might have become physical with Ariza. And of course, Howard and Andrew Bogut are always good for some extra tussling down low, too.
Golden State's average margin of victory in its quartet of wins over Houston is just over 15 points per game. Is it possible that Howard really believes Atlanta – their hometown team, by the way – is better than the ‘Dubs? Sure. That's how dominant the Hawks have been of late.
But it seems most likely that Dwight is simply unwilling to give credit to Steve Kerr's team because of the budding rivalry between the Western Conference powers. And unfortunately for us but fortunately for the Rockets, we won't get the chance to see how the Warriors respond to Howard's critique until spring time – if at all.

The baffling picture shows a nude man in the boot of a Mercedes which is parked on the driveway of a house in Mannheim, south-west Germany.
A dog lies nearby surrounded by the contents of the sports car's boot.
The image has prompted a rash of internet speculation over what activity the man could be involved in.
One Internet user told the CNET website they thought it was just ''an illusion'' with the man wearing tight skin-coloured shorts while fixing their brake light.
However Google has removed the image from Street View, which only went live in Germany at the beginning of the month.
It is not the first time a Google Street View image has provoked debate.
In August a photo emerged of what appeared to be a dead schoolgirl laying on the side of the road in Worcester.
However, it turned out to be ten-year-old Azura Beebeejaun who was lying downplaying dead with my friends.
Story highlights A source familiar with the plans says the announcement on leaks was in the works for some time
Trump said on Tuesday they want Sessions to be "much tougher on the leaks"
(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions will soon make an announcement regarding stepped-up efforts on leak investigations, according to an official familiar with the plans.
CNN has learned that the announcement has been in the works for some time and will now most likely happen in the next week.
The impending announcement from the Justice Department on leaks, first reported by The Washington Post, deepens the intrigue surrounding a possible detente between Trump and Sessions.
Hours after attacking Sessions for failing to investigate former 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the President appeared to make a second demand of their attorney general Tuesday, calling on them to crack down on "leaks" from various intelligence agencies.
"I want the attorney general to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies," Trump said. "These are intelligence agencies. We cannot have that happen."

Doug Paisley's three official releases show that they belong in the first rank of young(er) singer songwriters, and this ep is a great introduction to their work. Drawing inspiration from classic country and folk music, Paisley revists three tracks from their days as half of Darkhand & Lamplight and adds two songs new to me. Paisley has a way of making both their singing and their arrangements sound lost in time, and their songs are rugged and weary beyond their years. Anyone interested in Will Oldham, Bill Callahan or just about any notable indie singer songwriter of the last twenty years will find a lot to love in this ep and Paisley's two previous full lengths (also highly recommended). Their songs are easy to love at first hearing and age like fine Burgundy.
SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of – North Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently ordered preparations for launching “terror” attacks on South Koreans, a top Seoul official said Thursday, as worries about the North grow after its recent nuclear test and rocket launch.
In televised remarks, senior South Korean presidential official Kim Sung-woo said North Korea's spy agency has begun work to implement Kim Jong-un's order to “muster anti-South terror capabilities that can pose a direct threat to our lives and security.”
They said the possibility of North Korean attacks “is increasing more than ever” and asked for quick passage of an anti-terror bill in parliament.
North Korea has a history of attacks on South Korea, such as the 2010 shelling on an island that killed four South Koreans and the 1987 bombing of a South Korean passenger plane that killed all 115 people on board. But it is impossible to independently confirm claims about any such attack preparations. The South Korean presidential official did not say where the latest information came from.

Earlier Thursday, Seoul's National Intelligence Service briefed ruling Saenuri Party members on a similar assessment on North Korea's attack preparations, according to one of the party officials who attended the private meeting.
WATCH: Chang Yong Seok, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University, feels doubtful that there are many options for South Korea to take as independent countermeasures against Pyongyang.
During the briefing, the NIS, citing studies on past North Korean provocations and other unspecified assessments, said the attacks could target anti-Pyongyang activists, defectors and government officials in South Korea, the party official said requesting anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak to media publicly.
Attacks on subways, shopping malls and other public places could also happen, they said.
The official quoted the NIS as saying North Korea could launch poisoning attacks on the activists and defectors, or lure them to China where they would be kidnapped.
The Saenuri official refused to say whether the briefing discussed how the information was obtained. The NIS, which has a mixed record on predicting developments in North Korea, said it could not confirm its reported assessment.
The standoff with North Korea is not expected to ease soon, as Seoul and Washington are discussing deploying a sophisticated U.S. missile defence system in South Korea that Pyongyang warns would be a source of regional tension.

The allies also say their annual springtime military drills will be the largest ever. South Korea's defence minister said Thursday that about 15,000 U.S. troops will take part, double of the number Washington normally sends.
The North says the drills are preparation for a northward invasion.
Seoul defence officials also said that they began preliminary talks on Feb. 7 with the United States on deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence, the same day North Korea conducted what it said was a satellite launch but is condemned by Seoul and Washington as a banned test of missile technology.
The talks are aimed at working out details for formal missile deployment talks, such as who'll represent each side, according to Seoul's Defence Ministry.
The deployment is opposed by China and Russia too. Opponents say the system could help U.S. radar spot missiles in other countries.
The United States on Wednesday flew four stealth F-22 fighter jets over South Korea and reaffirmed it maintains an “ironclad commitment” to the defence of its Asian ally. Last month, it sent a nuclear-capable B-52 bomber to South Korea following the North's fourth nuclear test.
Foreign analysts say the North's rocket launch and nuclear test put the country further along it its quest for a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the U.S. mainland.
For the majority of students, law school can be an extremely costly endeavor. It's a well-known fact that most law students graduate with up to six figures of loan debt from their legal educations alone. If you aren't able to get a job as a lawyer with a high salary soon after graduating, you're going to have a very difficult time repaying all of that debt.
This couldn't possibly happen to me, you might protest. Even though 32 percent of first-year law students will lose their scholarships or have them reduced, you've got a middle-of-the-road scholarship that you plan to keep. What would you do if we told you that you'd still graduate with unbelievable debt, despite that scholarship?
According to a recent study performed by Law School Transparency, we now know that thanks to absurdly high tuition costs, law students with median scholarships who debt finance their degrees may still have screwed the pooch when it comes to their debt loads.
That being said, what are the top 10 most expensive law schools in the country for out-of-state students, even when median tuition discounts are included?
Columbia Law School: $263,694 total cost SUNY Buffalo Law: $253,482 total cost Fordham School of Law: $252,674 total cost Chicago Law School: $248,466 total cost Arizona Summit Law School: $247,186 total cost Cornell Law: $246,013 total cost NYU Law School: $245,780 total cost Harvard Law School: $245,019 total cost John Marshall Law-Chicago: $238,976 total cost USC Gould School of Law: $238,792 total cost
It will shock no one that half of the schools on this list come from the T14. It shouldn't be this way, but a legal education from one of the best law schools in the country will cost you an arm, a leg, your soul, and your first-born child if you should ever get a break from billing hours to get it in. The debt loads law students acquire from the schools on the other half of this list, however, are especially offensive considering their employment statistics.
Susan Adams of Forbes agreed when they wrote about LST's debt figures, and had this to say about Arizona Summit's and John Marshall's “struggling” graduates:
At Arizona Summit, which is owned by a private, for-profit company called InfiLaw that is a subsidiary of Chicago-based private equity firm Sterling Partners, only 45% of 2013 graduates had found full-time jobs requiring a J.D. within nine months of graduation, according to American Bar Association figures. An Arizona Summit spokesperson counters that 77% of the class of 2013 had found some kind of full-time work nine months after graduation, and that three years post-graduation, alumni made an average of $58,800. But that's not an encouraging number given that the cost for Arizona Summit is $247,000, according to LST's figures. At John Marshall Law School, No. 8 on LST's list, a J.D. costs $238,976. But only a little more than half of 2013 grads, 51.8%, had found full-time legal jobs nine months after graduation. (A spokesperson for John Marshall says, “We have a strong commitment to our students and their success. Our job placement numbers continue to improve, as does the outlook for the overall job market.”)
LST's list may be viewed as “controversial” due to the methodology used to calculate cost (using “real costs” to students versus a law school's “stated full-freight cost”), but we'd counter that it's better for prospective and current law students to have a sense of what they're getting into before they make the decision to shoulder a robust debt load in exchange for post-graduation employment prospects that are barely there.
If you're interested, you can take a look at Law School Transparency's eye-popping, jaw-dropping list of the costs of fully debt-financed law degrees over here. (For reference, Columbia Law's full debt-financed cost of attendance is $317,429. Ouch!)
How much does your law degree really cost? Is that terrifying amount actually worth it?

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — The pace of U.S. hiring partly snapped back in April after a surprising dip in March, suggesting that job creation is holding steady despite a raft of signs pointing to a third straight midyear slowdown in the economy.
The U.S. created a net 165,000 jobs in April and the hiring was stronger in March and February than initially reported, the Labor Department said Friday. The figures are seasonally adjusted
The increase in jobs exceeded the 135,000 forecasts of economists polled by MarketWatch. In market action, U.S. stocks rallied after the report.
“It's a heck of a lot better than other economic indicators were suggesting,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The acceleration in hiring also nudged the unemployment rate down to 7.5% from 7.6% in March. That's the lowest level since December 2008, the month before President Obama took office.
The unemployment rate fell even though the size of the labor force increased, which is a good sign. People enter the labor force when they think there's a better chance of finding work.
What's more, the economy created 114,000 additional jobs in March and February than initially estimated. The number of new jobs created in March was revised up to 138,000 from 88,000, while February's figure was revised up to 332,000 from 268,000.
The burst of job growth in February was the biggest since November 2005 for any month that did not include temporary Census bureau hiring.
Yet despite an improved labor market in April, companies are not hiring as many workers as they were just a few months ago and most economists think job growth will remain soft. Among the reasons: cuts in federal spending will accelerate and consumers are expected to feel a sharper bite from higher tax rates imposed in January.
“We still see a slowdown coming in the next couple of months,” Lee said. Economists polled by MarketWatch predict U.S. growth will slip to 1.5% in the second quarter from 2.5% in the first three months of the year.
The unemployment rate, for its part, won't shrink rapidly unless companies hire at a speedier clip. The U.S. needs to average around 250,000 jobs a month for an extended period to tug the jobless rate back down to precessions levels of under 6%.
The pace of hiring in April is far too slow to accomplish that task.
Inside the report
All the hiring in April took place in the private sector, which added 176,000 jobs. Professional services added 73,000 workers; bars and restaurants hired 38,000 people; and the retail business generated 29,000 jobs.
Yet nearly one of every five new workers hired in April took jobs as temps, indicating that companies are still reluctant to add permanent employees. The economy won't truly be ready to take off until temporary work leads more regularly to full-time jobs.
More reliance on temps also contributed to a decline in the amount of time people put in on the job. The average workweek fell two ticks to 34.4 hours and potentially reflected a dark underside to the April jobs report.
One of the few industries to cut employment was construction: 6,000 jobs were eliminated, mainly in nonresidential trades.
Yet home builders actually added workers last month to keep up with rising demand for new properties.
The government also extinguished 11,000 positions, marking the sixth decline in the past seven months.
Governments have cut half-million jobs in the past five years and the onset in March of billions of dollars in spending cuts under a law known as the sequester could also dampen employment. Some agencies are leaving open positions unfilled or are relying less on contractors.
Evidence of the sequester was expected to start to show up in April, but there was little evidence. “Outside of defense, I don't think we have seen a lot of impact,” said Frank Friedman, chief financial officer of the global business consulting firm Deloitte.
Still, economists say reduced federal spending could act as a drag on hiring and U.S. growth through the summer. And a host of recent reports appear to support the view growth has softened after a fast start to 2013.
Yet job growth isn't likely to evaporate, economists say. One reason: employees are already working long hours. Companies won't be able to keep increasing production unless they add more staff.
What might also entice companies to beef up is slow and stable wage growth. Hourly earnings edged up 4 cents in April to $23.87, but they've risen only 1.9% over the past 12 months.
On the other hand, inflation has largely eaten up the wage gains of workers, leaving them little extra purchasing power. Unless Americans are able to buy more goods and services, businesses are unlikely to see the kind of demand that would spur them to rapidly pad their payrolls.
The sluggish pace of hiring since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 is a big reason why the U.S. is expanding at a rate well below the norm at this stage of a recovery. The unemployment rate is an even larger 13.9%, up from 13.8% in March, if everyone who wants a full-time job but can't find one is included.
What's worse, some 4.4 million people have been unable to find a job in the past six months, a number that's still quite high by historically standards. The longer those people stay out of work the more their skills erode, making them less attractive to employers.
Efforts by U.S. lawmakers and the Federal Reserve have been unable to make a big dent in the number of long-term unemployed.
What follows is the text of my presentation, Functional options for friendly APIs that I gave at dotGo this year. It has been edited slightly for readability.
I want to thank Kelsey Hightower, Bill Kennedy, Jeremy Saenz, and Brian Ketelsen, for their assistance in preparing this talk.
I want to begin my talk with a story.
It is late 2014, your company is launching a revolutionary new distributed social network. Wisely, your team has chosen Go as the language for this product.
You have been tasked with writing the crucial server component. Possibly it looks a little like this.
There are some unexported fields that need to be initialised, and a goroutine must be started to service incoming requests.
The package has a simple API, it is pretty easy to use.
But, there is a problem. Soon after you announce your first beta release, the feature requests start to roll in.
Mobile clients are often slow to respond, or stop responding altogether—you'll need to add support for disconnecting these slow clients.
In this climate of heightened security awareness, your bug tracker starts to fill with demands to support secure connections.
Then, you get a report from a user who is running your server on a very small VPS. They need a way to limit the number of simultaneous clients.
Next is the request to rate limit concurrent connections from a group of users being targeted by a botnet.
… and on it goes.
Now, you need to change your API to incorporate all these feature requests.
It's kind of a sign that things are not going well when the function won't easily fit on a slide.
Show of hands, who has used an API like this ?
Who has written an API like this ?
Who has had their code break while depending on an API like this ?
Obviously this solution is cumbersome and brittle. It also isn't very discoverable.
Newcomers to your package have no idea which parameters are optional, and which are mandatory.
For example, if I want to create an instance of the Server for testing, do I need to provide a real TLS certificate ? If not, what do I provide instead ?
If I don't care about maxconns , or maxconcurrent what value should I use ? Do I use zero ? Zero sounds reasonable, but depending on how the feature was implemented, that might limit you to zero total concurrent connections.
It appears to me, that writing an API like this can be easy; as long as you make it the caller's responsibility to use it correctly.
While this example could be a considered an exaggeration, maliciously constructed and compounded by poor documentation, I believe that it demonstrates a real issue with ornate, brittle APIs such as this.
So now that I've defined the problem, lets look at some solutions.
Rather than trying to provide one single function which must cater for every permutation, a solution might be to create a set of functions.
With this approach, when callers need a secure server they can call the TLS variant.
When they need to establish a maximum duration for idle connections, they can use the variant that takes a timeout.
Unfortunately, as you can see, providing every possible permutation can quickly become overwhelming.
Let's move on to others way of making your API configurable.
A very common solution is to use a configuration struct.
This has some advantages.
Using this approach, the configuration struct can grow over time as new options are added, while the public API for creating a server itself remains unchanged.
This method can lead to better documentation.
What was once a massive comment block on the NewServer function, becomes a nicely documented struct.
Potentially it also enables the callers to use the zero value to signify they they want the default behaviour for a particular configuration option.
However, this pattern is not perfect.
It has trouble with defaults, especially if the zero value has a well understood meaning.
For example, in the config structure shown here, when Port is not provided, NewServer will return a *Server for listening on port 8080.
But this has the downside that you can no longer explicitly set Port to 0 and have the operating system automatically choose a free port, because that explicit 0 is indistinguishable from the fields' zero value.
Most of the time, users of your API will be expecting to use its default behaviour.
Even though they do not intend to change any of the configuration parameters, those callers are still required to pass something for that second argument.
So, when people read your tests or your example code, trying to figure out how to use your package, they'll see this magic empty value, and it'll become enshrined in the collective unconsciousness.
[and] to me, this just feel wrong.
Why should users of your API be required to construct an empty value, simply to satisfy the signature of the function ?
A common solution to this empty value problem is to pass a pointer to the value instead, thereby enabling callers to use nil rather than constructing an empty value.
In my opinion this pattern has all the problems of the previous example, and it adds a few more.
We still have to pass something for this function's second argument, but now this value could be nil , and most of the time will be nil for those wanting the default behaviour.
It raises the question, is there a difference between passing nil , and passing a pointer to an empty value ?
More concerning to both the package's author, and its callers, is the Server and the caller can now share a reference to the same configuration value. Which gives rise to questions of what happens if this value is mutated after being passed to the NewServer function ?
I believe that well written APIs should not require callers to create dummy values to satisfy those rarer use cases.
I believe that we, as Go programmers, should work hard to ensure that nil is never a parameter that needs to be passed to any public function.
And when we do want to pass configuration information, it should be as self explanatory and as expressive as possible.
So now with these points in mind, I want to talk about what I believe are some better solutions.
To remove the problem of that mandatory, yet frequently unused, configuration value, we can change the NewServer function to accept a variable number of arguments.
Instead of passing nil , or some zero value, as a signal that you want the defaults, the variadic nature of the function means you don't need to pass anything at all.
And in my book this solves two big problems.
First, the invocation for the default behaviour becomes as concise as possible.
Secondly, NewServer now only accepts Config values, not pointers to config values, removing nil as a possible argument, and ensuring that the caller cannot retain a reference to the server's internal configuration.
I think this is a big improvement.
But if we're being pedantic, it still has a few problems.
Obviously the expectation is for you to provide at most one Config value. But as the function signature is variadic, the implementation has to be written to cope with a caller passing multiple, possibly contradictory, configuration structs.
Is there a way to use a variadic function signature and improve the expressiveness of configuration parameters when needed ?
I think that there is.
At this point I want to make it clear that that the idea of functional options comes from a blog post titled. Self referential functions and design by Rob Pike, published in January this year. I encourage everyone here to read it.
The key difference from the previous example, and in fact all the examples so far, is customisation of the Server is performed not with configuration parameters stored in a structure, but with functions which operate on the Server value itself.
As before, the variadic nature of the function's signature gives us the compact behaviour for the default case.
When configuration is required, I pass to NewServer functions which operate on the Server value as an argument.
The timeout function simply changes the timeout field of any *Server value passed to it.
The tls function is a little more complicated. It takes a *Server value and wraps the original listener value inside a tls.Listener , thereby transforming it into a secure listener.
Inside NewServer , applying these options is straightforward.
After opening a net.Listener , we declare a Server instance using that listener .
Then, for each option function provided to NewServer , we call that function, passing in a pointer to the Server value that was just declared.
Obviously, if no option functions were provided, there is no work to do in this loop and so srv is unchanged.
And that's all there is too it.
Using this pattern we can make an API that has
sensible defaults
is highly configurable
can grow over time
self documenting
safe for newcomers
and never requires nil or an empty value to keep the compiler happy
In the few minutes I have remaining I'd like to show you how I improved one of my own packages by converting it to use functional options.
I'm an amateur hardware hacker, and many of the devices I work with use a USB serial interface. A so a few months ago I wrote a terminal handling package.
In the prior version of this package, to open a serial device, change the speed and set the terminal to raw mode, you'd have to do each of these steps individually, checking the error at every stage.
Even though this package is trying to provide a friendlier interface on an even lower level interface, it still left too many procedural warts for the user.
Let's take a look at the package after applying the functional options pattern.
By converting the Open function to use a variadic parameter of function values, we get a much cleaner API.
In fact, it's not just the Open API that improves, the grind of setting an option, checking an error, setting the next option, checking the error, that is gone as well.
The default case, still just takes one argument, the name of the device.
For more complicated use cases, configuration functions, defined in the term package, are passed to the Open function and are applied in order before returning.
This is the same pattern we saw in the previous example, the only thing that is different is rather than being anonymous, these are public functions. In all other respects their operation is identical.
We'll take a look at how Speed , RawMode , and Open , are implemented on the next slide.
RawMode is the easiest to explain. It just a function whose signature is compatible with Open.
Because RawMode is declared in the same package as Term , it can access the private fields and call private methods declared on the Term type, in this case calling the private setRawMode helper.
Speed is also just a regular function, however it does not match the signature Open requires. This is because Speed itself requires an argument; the baud rate.
Speed returns an anonymous function which is compatible with the Open function's signature, which closes over the baud rate parameter, capturing it for later when the function is applied.
Inside the call to Open , we first open the terminal device with the openTerm helper.
Next, just as before, we range over the slice of options functions, calling each one in turn passing in t , the pointer to our term.Term value.
If there is an error applying any function then we stop at that point, clean up and return the error to the caller.
Otherwise, returning from the function, we've now created and configured a Term value to the caller's specifications.
In summary
Functional options let you write APIs that can grow over time.
They enable the default use case to be the simplest.
They provide meaningful configuration parameters.
Finally they give you access to the entire power of the language to initialize complex values.
In this talk, I have presented many of the existing configuration patterns, those considered idiomatic and commonly in use today, and at every stage asked questions like:
Can this be made simpler ?
Is that parameter necessary ?
Does the signature of this function make it easy for it to be used safely ?
Does the API contain traps or confusing misdirection that will frustrate ?
I hope I have inspired you to do the same. To revisit code that you have written in the past and pose yourself these same questions and thereby improve it.
Thank you.
DANO: We did Love & Mercy this summer, and it's some of the most fun I've ever had. He's a really special man, Brian Wilson, and, not just the ‘60s and the music, but their spirit is really special and strong. And, I just fell in love with them and what they did. If you listen to Pet Sounds, there's really nothing like it before or since, and it was just a joy filling up on that, and learning to play the piano. I got to work with these amazing musicians and, it was just a joy. I don't know if I should say that since it's a ways off but, I think he's got a really great story. He's a special guy. I hope that we do them justice.
One of the reasons I'm so excited about the project, besides your involvement in it, is the screenplay by Oren [Moverman]. I loved Rampart and The Messenger. He's just a great screenwriter, and I'm curious what they brought to the table in terms of this script.
DANO: Well Oren is my friend now, and he's a great guy. He's a wonderful writer like you said. I don't wanna give away what they wrote, but I will say that, I think that they tried to capture Brian's spirit as well as tell a story. I don't think it's a totally traditional biopic. I think it's gonna be a fun and accessible film, and I think it's hopefully going to be interesting, like the man that it's depicting. I think they did an amazing job cracking this story, and I can't imagine anyone else having done it, aside from him. I know they tried to make movies about Brian for a long time, and I think music stories are tough to tell in an interesting way. The fact that Bill [Polad] got Oren to write it is really also a smart choice on their behalf.
I know you don't wanna talk more about it, but I have one more question on this particular film. I'm curious if you've heard that Atticus Ross was designing the film's soundscape. I'm curious to know if you've heard any of the score of what he's done?
DANO: I haven't yet. I got to hang out with Atticus a little bit. They seemed super excited, and I think they're approaching that stuff in a really cool way. I'm hoping to hear some of it soon actually, but we just finished at the end of August and I'm still detoxing, and trying to steer clear for a little bit. Then, I'll be excited to see what they're cooking up.

Defending their record as manager, the Scot also claimed that the club "is now where it was before", adding: "What other areas are there to improve on - apart from points?"
Everton make the short trip to Anfield tonight looking for their first Premier League win there since 1999, but Liverpool 's defeat at Sunderland at the weekend was the first time since 2003 Liverpool had lost three successive league matches.
However, Dalglish believes that the squad is stronger than last year while the club as a whole is going from strength to strength.
"The club is now where it was before - each one for each one, everybody in it together," said the Liverpool manager. "There are many ways you can judge a season and the best way is progress at the football club as a whole. I don't think it necessarily relates to trophies or points.
"You can measure it by how the club has progressed and where it is, from the first team to the kids. Off the pitch, especially, the club is a lot stronger than what it was."
Referring to Liverpool's six-year, £300 million deal with US-based Warrior Sports in January, Dalglish added: "You go off the pitch and see how much money we are getting through sponsorship and kit deals."
"You look at the academy and see how much better it is. You look around here [at Melwood] and most of the people have got a smile on their faces now. The squad is stronger than it was last year. What other areas are there to improve on - apart from points?"
But Dalglish knows there is nothing like a derby, with the added atmosphere of being played under floodlights, to give people the necessary lift.
"It is a massive game, like any derby is for any club involved in one," said the Scot.
"We know how much enjoyment the people get out of winning the game but the players get a lot out of enjoyment out of it also.
"The winners get to enjoy it. You get the bragging rights for the city but both clubs come straight out of that into two FA Cup quarter-final ties so you don't get much time to rest on your laurels - and you wouldn't want to either."

Last night on Fox Business Network, Kennedy faced off with Jill Stein about their push for vote recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
The former Green Party presidential candidate insisted that they don't want to change the outcome of the election, but instead that they want to root out fraud.
Kennedy pointed out that Stein wants recounts in three states won by President-elect Donald Trump, and none won by Hillary Clinton.
They added that there's no evidence that any voting systems were hacked in any state.
“We're going to the three states that are most likely to show hacking because they had razor-thin margins, because they have corrupt voting machines," Stein said. "In Wisconsin, they use voting machines that are illegal to use in California because they are so tamper-friendly. They are wide open, they're an invitation to tampering."
While Stein acknowledged they have no hard evidence of hacking, they pointed out that there has been election-related hacking on the periphery of the campaign, from private emails to the DNC database.
Kennedy argued that all the data shows that Trump won the election due to shifting demographics, not vote irregularities.
They praised Stein as a woman of "great integrity," but said they must know that there is no justification for recounts.
"Is this how you want to be remembered?" Kennedy asked.
Watch Stein discuss the recount push on "America's Newsroom" below, and let us know what you think in the comments. You can watch "Kennedy," weeknights at 8pm ET on Fox Business Network.

Sols 1346-1347: Onward to Fracture Town
18 May 2016
We are coming up on the edge of Naukluft plateau (again!). The plan for Sol 1346 starts off with ChemCam observations of the targets “Etusis” and “Etiro”, to continue measuring the variations in silica abundance around large fractures. Mastcam has a context image of these two targets, plus a mosaic looking ahead to an area we've been calling “Fracture Town”. After that, the rover will drive and do standard post-drive imaging, plus CheMin will do another analysis of the Okoruso sample.
On Sol 1347, the rover has a number of atmospheric observations, plus a ChemCam observation using the AEGIS software to target a nice patch of bedrock automatically. This is a new capability, and it's really nice to be able to get some data after we drive without having Earth in the loop!

Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status
The term “fake news” has been brewing in the media mix for weeks. But it appears to have reached a crescendo this week after two news organizations in particular embraced and published unverified smears against President-elect Donald Trump. The claims grew louder in the re-telling. A Newsbusters.org study found that ABC, CBS and NBC spent a combined 44 minutes on the “malicious hit piece” on Wednesday alone, with more to come.
And there are real consequences, says one veteran media analyst.
“This fiasco is exactly why the media's ratings are in the toilet. It's exactly why Donald Trump said the election was rigged and it's also why Donald Trump hasn't done many press conferences,” said Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center, a conservative press watchdog.
They advise news organizations who dabble in fake news to seriously revisit the craft of journalism. They also say the rest of the news media community should condemn the practice of using unverified or faked accounts in their own reporting.
“And President-elect Trump shouldn't conduct any more press conferences unless and until the news media start treating them fairly,” Mr. Bozell said.
In addition, an earlier Newsbuster analysis also followed claims that Russian interference had compromised the 2016 presidential election.
“If you weren't paying attention in the past month, you might actually believe that Russian spies infiltrated our voting booths to help Donald Trump win the presidential election. Well, at least that's the perception the big three news networks are trying to create by repeatedly insisting that Russia ‘hacked the election,' ” wrote analyst Kristine Marsh.
From Dec. 8 of last year to Jan. 8, journalists on ABC, CBS and NBC repeated this loaded phrase at least 49 times in their morning and evening broadcasts, Ms. Marsh said.
“After blaming the electoral college for Hillary Clinton's loss didn't work, the media moved on to blur the release of Democratic e-mails with the idea that Russia hacked the election,” they added.

RAWSTORY — A group calling itself “Arrest Bush 2009” has announced its intention to hold a “Yes We Can Arrest Bush” event in front of the FBI Building in Washington, DC during the Inaugural Parade.
However, coordinator Jose Rodriguez insists, “It's not a protest; it's a celebratory event.”
Arrest Bush 2009, which is sponsored by the Washington Peace Center, After Downing Street, and Shoes For Bush, is demanding that Bush be arrested for war crimes and for lying to the American people.
Calls for Bush's arrest began last March, when two Vermont towns approved a measure “that would instruct police to arrest President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for ‘crimes against our Constitution.'” In September, a large “Arrest Bush/Cheney” banner was hung on a ledge at the National Archives by members of Veterans for Peace.
According to the press release from Arrest Bush 2009, “We call for the arrest of George W. Bush for instigating war against a sovereign nation that posed no threat, wanton attacks on civilian populations, use of torture, and violations of the U.N. Charter. We call for the arrest of George W. Bush for lying to Congress and the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, for the deaths of US service members and Iraqi civilians, and for the abuse of the United States Constitution.”
Shoes for Bush also plans a separate “shoe hurling action” on January 19 to protest what they anticipate will be Bush's “unprecedented pardoning of crimes they authorized.” Veterans are encouraged to bring their combat boots to hurl.
During Bush's second inauguration in January 2005, an estimated 10,000 antiwar protesters showed up in Washington, and there were protests in other cities as well. However, it is not clear how much attention anti-Bush protests will garner on a day when most Americans may simply be glad to see them leaving town.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new U.S. export restriction against China's ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged Iran sanctions violations is likely to disrupt the telecom manufacturer's sprawling global supply chain and could create substantial parts shortages, according to sanctions experts.
Under the measure announced by the Commerce Department on Monday, U.S. manufacturers will be banned from selling components to ZTE, which is a major global supplier of telecom-networking equipment. In addition, foreign manufacturers will be prohibited from selling products containing a significant amount of U.S.-made parts to the Chinese company.
The Commerce Department, confirming the decision that was first reported by Reuters on Saturday, said ZTE planned to use a series of shell companies “to illicitly reexport controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws.” It said ZTE acted “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.”
While ZTE suppliers can apply for an export license to ship any American-made equipment or parts, the Commerce Department said such license applications generally will be denied.
The export restriction, which does not stop ZTE from selling handsets in the United States, is expected to have a global impact.
“It is going to have a large ripple effect. It's very significant to many companies both in the U.S. and (outside the) U.S.,” said Doug Jacobson, an export attorney at law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, who said they have been fielding calls from clients who supply ZTE since Reuters broke news of the impending export restrictions.
For example, a Taiwanese chipmaker that uses American-made components to make processors for ZTE handsets would likely have to cut off those sales. If the Taiwanese supplier only procures components from outside the United States it can continue to sell to ZTE, experts said.
“I am telling all my clients today that anything (for ZTE)not already on board an airplane going to China, you cannot ship it starting tonight. They have to scrub and screen their customers lists – pending orders and future orders – to make sure that any transactions with ZTE are flagged and stopped.”
ZTE, which has annual sales of more than $15 billion and is the only Chinese smartphone maker with a meaningful presence in the U.S. market, can appeal the decision.
ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records. In 2014, the department restricted exports to Russian energy companies Lukoil OAO and Gazprom OAO, but those restrictions only stopped American companies from supplying certain types of oil-production projects, such as Arctic offshore and deepwater drilling.
EFFECT ON HANDSET PRODUCTION
ZTE is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers - AT&T (T.N), T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N).
Although ZTE is not being banned from selling handsets in the United States, the restriction could disrupt handset production if ZTE sources U.S.-made parts to manufacture its handsets, experts said.
AT&T declined to comment, and T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment.
A ZTE website states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are “key strategic partners.”
Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they were ZTE suppliers, but did not elaborate on specific products sold to the Chinese company or how sanctions would affect their businesses.
Texas Instruments (TXN.O), which has also said it provides processors for the Chinese company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The impact of the new restrictions on these three companies was not immediately clear as most of them produce components both in the United States and overseas.
Microsoft, in an emailed statement, said, “We follow U.S. law and will review new U.S. restrictions.”
A spokesperson for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if ZTE purchases other products, such as software.
The other U.S. companies did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. decision could even prompt suppliers to halt sales of non-U.S. components that are still allowed, said Kay Georgi, an export attorney at law firm Arent Fox LLP.

“When you get placed on one of these lists nobody wants to do business with you at all,” Georgi said.
The United States has long banned the sale of U.S.-made technology products to Iran as part of its sanctions, even as China maintains close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties with Tehran. Last year, the United States and major world powers reached a deal with Iran to loosen economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.
“We hope this sends a strong message to ZTE, to China, and to other Chinese telecommunications companies who present serious national security risks not only by evading export controls, but by purposefully compromising supply chain security,” said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.

AARON KILEY From the January 2015 issue of Car and Driver
If you live in Arizona, Louisiana, New York, or one of more than a dozen other states, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has bad news for you. Come January 19, your driver's license will no longer allow you access to certain federal facilities. Unless DHS changes its mind. Again.
In 2005, Congress passed a bill called the Real ID Act, based upon recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission. Whether or not you've heard of the law depends largely upon how in tune you are with conspiracy theories. Where you live matters, too, because nearly a decade after the law's passage, only 19 states actually comply with its standards.
Real ID's stated intent is to ensure that all jurisdictions issuing driver's licenses and other identification meet federal stand­ards, “which should inhibit terrorists' ability to evade detection by using fraudulent identification.” Basically, the government is upping the ante on what it will accept as valid forms of ID at federal facilities, nuclear power plants, and—here's the biggie—federally regulated airline flights (i.e., most of them).
Opponents fear that Real ID will lead to a national identity card like those issued by “totalitarian” governments and that its requirement that states share data from their department of motor vehicle databases is an invasion of privacy. Others object because Congress didn't offer financial backing to help states implement Real ID. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) contends that the program wastes state resources while doing little to combat terrorism, calling it a “bureaucratic nightmare.”

For its part, Homeland Security promises that Real ID will leave states with control over the look and administration of driver's licenses, and, more important, over the information they collect to issue them. “There is no federal database of driver information,” the agency says on its website, although the ACLU contends that the law says otherwise. What does non-compliance mean for residents of those states? Most states have been granted extensions, although many have passed legislation that amounts to a promise not to comply.
For most Americans, that flight restriction is the big worry. But DHS says that any state driver's license will be accepted as a valid ID at airports until at least 2016. And after that, passports and other federal IDs will work. The ACLU doesn't put much stock in DHS deadlines either way, including the latest one. “We know how it's going to play out because it's played out three times already,” says Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the ACLU. “They give a deadline, the deadline goes, and then they give an extension. The states know that DHS isn't going to keep all the residents from non–Real ID states from boarding airplanes.” Which means that those refusing to play along might just achieve the goal of dooming Real ID to failure.
Iranian authorities have erected statues in Kurdish cities honouring 'Muslim Peshmerga' who have fought with the Basij paramilitary forces under the command of the Revolutionary Guards.
In the week commemorating the Basij forces, Iran has begun building 10 statues in 10 Kurdish cities. On Saturday, Iranian authorities unveiled one of the statues in the city of Mariwan, northwestern Iran.
Mohamad Taqi Osanlou, an Iranian commander, said the aim is to provide a place for people to gather and share the memories of the 'Muslim Peshmerga' from one generation to another.
The paramilitary force was formed soon after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and tasked with putting an end to the Kurdish rebellion that was calling for greater national and cultural rights.
Supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who is regarded as one of the founders of the 'Muslim Peshmerga,' expressed their gratitude for the forces that they claimed numbers a lot in Kurdish areas.
"There has been no shortage of brave and loyal brothers in Kurdish areas, and in every part of Kurdish areas there have been loyal and believing brothers who did so much for the revolution," Khamenei said last year as they received a delegation from the Muslim Peshmerga.
"Their role model was the youth who gathered around the Muslim Peshmerga, took up arms and went to the war zone endangering their lives, and that of their families."
Group to give away 30 guns in 30 days in PR bid (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) Story Highlights The Gun-A-Day giveaway promotion lasts 30 days in April
The pro-gun group will give a daily winner the value of the gun featured that day
The group says it isn't a stunt it but an attempt to promote its product
Even as images of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings are fresh in America's conscious, a pro-gun group is sponsoring a promotion to give away 30 guns in 30 days for the month of April.
Technically, the U.S. Concealed Carry Association -- publisher of Concealed Carry magazine -- isn't giving away guns, but, it says, the exact dollar value of each gun that it posts daily on its website for the month of April. The group expects to give away about $20,000 to its members this month -- whom it hopes will use the money to purchase guns.
"I'm very sorry about what happened at Sandy Hook," says Tim Schmidt, founder of group based in Jackson, Wis. "But if there were more responsibly armed citizens, this sort of thing wouldn't happen."
The move comes at a time President Obama is lobbying for gun legislation and when nine of 10 Americans say they support toughened background checks for gun ownership. With the topic of gun violence front-and-center in America, the timing of the public relations gambit is obvious -- but it may be a bust, one public relations expert says.
"Good public relations is not just about getting coverage -- which this certainly will," says Steve Barrett, editor-in-chief of PR Week, a trade publication. "Good PR is about furthering your brand's objective. And this certainly doesn't further the objective that gun owners are responsible."
Schmidt insists it's not a stunt. But their group's marketing director concedes it's a well-timed PR ploy. "To be honest, that's it exactly what is," Franklin Cole says. "We want to get the word out about the product we offer."
That product includes a magazine that publishes eight times a year as well as a series of DVDs and videos that, Cole says, teach about responsible gun ownership. Revenue at the group's parent company, Delta Defense, topped $12 million last year, Schmidt says.
But some are abhorred.
"It's stunts like this that distract from what's really important," says Debra DeShong Reed, a spokesperson from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "Putting more guns out on the street is not the answer."
A spokesperson at Sandy Hook Promise, the Newtown, Conn., community group formed in response to the Sandy Hook tragedy, declined to comment.
But Patrick Brown, a retired jockey from York, Pa., is tickled about winning $700 from the group this week. While they won't use the money to purchase firearms -- since they already own three -- they plan to use some of it to buy additional ammunition for target practice.
"But I won't use all of it on ammo," they say. "It's in the bank. A prize is a prize, so it's my money."

Tesla's partner Panasonic announces expanded electric vehicle battery production in Japan
As Tesla ramps up its production for the Model 3, one of its partners is also planning to increase production of electric vehicle batteries halfway around the world. According to the Japan Times, "Panasonic Corp. said Friday it will start manufacturing lithium-ion batteries for electric cars in fiscal 2019 at its plant in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, expanding domestic production to meet growing demand for green vehicles across the globe."

It's reported that, "Panasonic has been expanding its lithium-ion battery production both at home and abroad. The Japanese electronics maker supplies lithium-ion batteries to U.S. electric-car maker and energy company Tesla Inc., and the two companies also jointly run a plant in Nevada named Gigafactory that mass-produces the batteries."

It turns out that Panasonic's latest plant will be a factory conversion from LCD TV panel production to lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. "The Osaka-based electronics maker is likely to spend tens of billions of yen on setting up production lines there... [and] within Japan, Panasonic already has five other lithium-ion battery production plants." Panasonic's latest plans are aligned with recent efforts to pivot its business towards the auto sector.

Nasdaq (via Reuters) notes that, "Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc's mass-market Model 3, is reinventing itself as a provider of advanced auto parts to escape the price competition of smartphones and other lower-margin consumer products." And Panasonic's new direction is proving to be increasingly promising: "Panasonic sees batteries as a key driver for its plan to nearly double its automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen ($22 billion) in the year through March 2022."

And that's not all — the company is also opening a new battery plant in Dalian, China. In addition to Tesla, it's likely Pansonic's new plants will service multiple automakers, especially in light of changes occurring in the world's biggest auto market, China. Panasonic said in a statement: "The global market for eco-conscious vehicles has been growing... [leading to] increasing expectations from auto manufacturers on Panasonic, the leading manufacturer of automotive lithium-ion batteries."

The United States has north of 60,000 soldiers stationed near the N. Korean theatre. Maybe Father Trump is right in starting a world war. There are rampant reports that a full scale ground war is underway in Syria involving more than 10,000 US troops. As a society, we've been softened by mentally ill libtards — made to waffle and lose grip of reality amidst a degradation of morals and family structure. Perhaps we've gone past the point of no return, and on a macro level, we need to be bloodied, in order to build a generation of hardened men who can lead by example.
Here's what we're sending to join our forces in the region.
With that in mind, a US carrier group, led by the USS Carl Vinson is heading towards N. Korea, which will be accompanied by several Japanese destroyers. A quickening of crisis looms just around the bend — with President Trump committing to striking N. Korea if they test a nuclear bomb or a long range missile. In response to these provocations, N. Korea ordered the evacuation of 600,000 citizens from Pyongyang and issued the following statements.
In a statement provided to CNN by officials in North Korea, Pyongyang said the “current grim situation” justified its “self-defensive and pre-emptive strike capabilities with the nuclear force at the core.” “We will make the US fully accountable for the catastrophic consequences that may be brought about by its high-handed and outrageous acts,” the statement said. “By relentlessly bringing in a number of strategic nuclear assets to the Korean peninsula, the U.S. is gravely threatening the peace and safety and driving the situation to the brink of a nuclear war.” North Korea's vice foreign minister on Friday blamed President Trump for building up a “vicious cycle” of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, saying their “aggressive” tweets were “making trouble.” In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press in Pyongyang, Vice Minister Han Song Ryol also warned the U.S. against provoking North Korea militarily, saying, “We will go to war if they choose.” “If the U.S. comes with reckless military maneuvers then we will confront it with the DPRK's pre-emptive strike,” Han said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. “We've got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. pre-emptive strike.” “Trump is always making provocations with their aggressive words,” Han said. “So that's why. It's not the DPRK but the U.S. and Trump that makes trouble.” “As long as the nuclear threats and blackmail go on with the military exercises, we will carry forward with our national defense buildup, the core of which is the nuclear arms buildup,” Han said. “Whatever comes from the U.S., we will cope with it. We are fully prepared to handle it.”
So, N. Korea doesn't like Trump's aggressive words and tweets. This is rich, coming from a failed state that has menaced the United States will a nuclear winter for the past 20 years.
Now for some analysis.
Globalist shill and former head of the CIA, Leon Panetta, says Seoul will be ‘wiped out', all 20 million people dead — should N. Korea engage in nuclear war.
Couple this with reports that China sent 150,000 soldiers to the N. Korea border, which would be used to contain a massive influx of N. Korean migrants into China in the event of a conflagration, it looks likely that the beginnings of World War 3 are taking shape.

Controlling Your Computer With Your Eyes
Millions of people suffering from multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries or amputees could soon interact with their computers and surroundings using just their eyes, thanks to a new device that costs less than £40 (~$63).
Composed from off-the-shelf materials, the new device can work out exactly where a person is looking by tracking their eye movements, allowing them to control a cursor on a screen just like a normal computer mouse.
The technology comprises an eye-tracking device and “smart” software that have been presented July 13, in IOP Publishing's Journal of Neural Engineering. Researchers from Imperial College London demonstrated its functionality by getting a group of people to play the classic computer game Pong without any kind of handset. In addition users were able to browse the web and write emails “hands-off.”
The GT3D device is made up of two fast video game console cameras, costing less than £20 each, that are attached, outside of the line of vision, to a pair of glasses that cost just £3. The cameras constantly take pictures of the eye, working out where the pupil is pointing, and from this the researchers can use a set of calibrations to work out exactly where a person is looking on the screen.
Even more impressively, the researchers are also able to use more detailed calibrations to work out the 3D gaze of the subjects — in other words, how far into the distance they were looking. It is believed that this could allow people to control an electronic wheelchair simply by looking where they want to go or control a robotic prosthetic arm.
Comprised of off-the-shelf materials, the new device, can work out exactly where a person is looking by tracking their eye movements, allowing them to control a cursor on a screen just like a normal computer mouse. The researchers demonstrated the device by getting students to play the computer game Pong using just their eyes. Video from Youtube.com user InstituteofPhysics.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the eye-tracker, the researchers got subjects to play the video game Pong. In this game, the subject used their or their eyes to move a bat to hit a ball that was bouncing around the screen — a feat that is difficult to accomplish with other read-out mechanisms such as brain waves (EEG).
Dr Aldo Faisal, Lecturer in Neurotechnology at Imperial's Department of Bioengineering and the Department of Computing, is confident in the ability to utilise eye movements given that six of the subjects, who had never used their eyes as a control input before, could still register a respectable score within 20 per cent of the able bodied users after just 10 minutes of using the device for the first time.
The commercially viable device uses just one watt of power and can transmit data wirelessly over Wi-Fi or via USB into any Windows or Linux computer.
The GT3D system has also solved the ‘Midas touch problem', allowing users to click on an item on the screen using their eyes, instead of a mouse button.
This problem has previously been resolved by staring at an icon for a prolonged period or blinking; however, the latter is part of our natural behaviour and happens unintentionally. Instead, the researchers calibrated the system so that a simple wink would represent a mouse click, which only occurs voluntarily unlike the blink.
Dr Faisal said: “Crucially, we have achieved two things: we have built a 3D eye tracking system hundreds of times cheaper than commercial systems and used it to build a real-time brain machine interface that allows patients to interact more smoothly and more quickly than existing invasive technologies that are tens of thousands of times more expensive.
“This is frugal innovation; developing smarter software and piggy-backing existing hardware to create devices that can help people worldwide independent of their healthcare circumstances.”

today admitted that the timing of its High Commissioner to Abdul Basit's meeting with the Hurriyat leaders ahead of the Foreign Secretary-level talks was "perhaps not totally right".
Basit's meeting with the Hurriyat leaders prompted to call off the Foreign Secretary-level talks which were to be held in on August 25.
Pointing out that while meetings between Pakistani diplomats and Hurriyat leaders had been a "regular practice for the last 30 years and there was noting new in it", Pakistan's National Security and Foreign Affairs Adviser Sartaj Aziz said: "In this case perhaps, the timing was not totally right because the substantial discussion on Kashmir was yet to start."
The FS-level meeting on August 25 was to declare the agenda (of bilateral talks), they said.
Aziz said had the request from about not holding meeting with Hurriyat leaders ahead of the FS-level meeting because the timing was not right come a little earlier "probably it could have been considered."
However, in this case the "message came at a time when one Hurriyat leader was already in Pakistan's High Commission (in New Delhi)," they told Headlines Today channel.
BERLIN — When Europe's Rosetta probe gets roused from its deep space slumber next month, scientists are hoping it will wake up fit and ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land a spacecraft on a comet.
There is little room for mistakes as the coming months involve a high-speed chase, a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and finally the precision drop of a lander onto its icy surface — set for Nov. 11, 2014.
“Imagine trying to parachute onto the tip of a mountain,” said Paolo Ferri, head of mission operations at the European Space Agency.
The effort is different from NASA's Deep Impact probe that fired a projectile into comet Tempel in 2005, hurling a plume of matter into space for scientists to study. That mission was more of a sniper shot compared to the extended rendezvous the European Space Agency is planning for its spacecraft.
Launched in 2004, Rosetta has already spent almost 10 years in space preparing for its big day. The probe had to conduct three fly-bys of Earth and one of Mars, taking advantage of the planets' gravity to accelerate sufficiently to intercept comet 67P as it orbits the sun at speeds of up to 100,000 kph (62,000 mph).
The spacecraft has been in hibernation for more than two years now to conserve energy. ESA has been using the time to solve two glitches that could jeopardize the mission: a problem with two of the four 'reaction wheels' used to turn the spacecraft, and a small leak of helium that could affect the thrusters which are vital for its final manoeuvrs.
“This is making our life more difficult,” Ferri acknowledges. But engineers have found workarounds.
The wakeup call for Rosetta is due to happen at 5 a.m. EST on Jan. 20. If all goes according to plan, the probe's instruments will slowly switch themselves back on, though scientists will have a tense few hours of waiting before they can be sure the spacecraft is in full working order.
The following months will involve a gradual approach of 67P, as Rosetta gently slows down and eventually draws up alongside the comet in what Ferri likened to two planes flying in formation. This will give the mission team time to take plenty of pictures of the comet, which is about four kilometres in diameter, and identify a good landing site.
At the moment scientists are divided over whether to pick a site close to the comet's three active regions — where matter appears to be released into space — or to stay away from them to prevent dust from harming the lander's sensitive instruments.
The lander — called Philae — will drop onto the surface of 67P and latch on using a harpoon, to prevent it from drifting off into space due to the comet's weak gravity. Using drills, it will dig up samples and analyze them using on-board instruments.
Researchers hope to gain fascinating insights from the results, because comets have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the universe.
“This time capsule's been locked away for 4.6 billion years,” said ESA's director of science Mark McCaughrean.
One key question scientists hope the mission can help answer is whether comets are responsible for the water on Earth, they said.
West Ham United land Italy international striker Simone Zaza on initial season-long loan
West Ham United land Italy international striker Simone Zaza on initial season-long loan Prolific centre forward joins from Italian champions Juventus
Zaza has already scored at London Stadium in Betway Cup earlier this month
West Ham United have added star power to their forward line by signing Italy international striker Simone Zaza.
The 25-year-old forward joins the Hammers for an initial €5m loan fee, with a permanent fee of €20m automatically triggered after a certain number of Premier League appearances this season, plus a further €3m in contingent payments.
The latest arrival takes the Club's spending to more than £60m this summer, with Zaza becoming West Ham's eleventh signing of a busy transfer window.
The signing again illustrates the Board's commitment to reinvesting the revenue raised from the Club's move to London Stadium and building a squad commensurate with those stunning surroundings.
A strong, quick centre forward blessed with powerful aerial ability and a lethal left foot, Zaza arrives in east London after helping Juve win Serie A and featuring for their country at UEFA Euro 2016.
Zaza, who scored Juve's winner in the Betway Cup win at London Stadium earlier this month, cannot wait to get started under new manager Slaven Bilic.
Zaza said: “I want to thank everyone for welcoming me including the fans and everyone at the Club. I wanted to start a new experience and I feel this is the right choice for me.
“I have been fortunate enough to have already played at the new Stadium with a different shirt. It is a beautiful stadium and I felt the warmth of the fans and this was a big reason why I wanted to join the Club.
“I want to become a better player and I know I can do that at West Ham. Unfortunately we could not qualify for the Europa League, but I am hoping I can help the Club do that next season.”

Capped 14 times by the Azzurri, Zaza was born in Policoro in the far south of Italy, where they started their career with Stella Azzurra Bernalda as a schoolboy.
After four years with Valdera, the left-sided forward made their senior breakthrough with Bergamo-based Atalanta, where they made their first-team debut at the age of 17 in 2009.
Sampdoria moved for Zaza in 2010, and they spent a season in Genoa before being loaned to lower-league Juve Stabia and Viareggio, where they hit the net with increasing regularity.
In 2012/13, the shaven-headed striker pushed themselves onto the national stage during a season-long loan spell at Ascoli, where they netted 18 goals in 35 Serie B appearances.
That form saw Serie A newcomers Sassuolo move for Zaza on a permanent basis, and they repaid their faith by scoring the goals which helped the Neroverdi beat the drop in dramatic style.
The 2014/15 season was even better for both Zaza, who scored eleven Serie A goals, and their club, who finished comfortably in mid-table.
Capped regularly at age-group level by their country, Zaza's goalscoring and fine all-round play saw them awarded their full Italy debut against the Netherlands in August 2014, scoring their maiden goal on their second appearance against Norway the same month.
An international and former Juventus teammate of West Ham's Angelo Ogbonna, Zaza appeared three times at Euro 2016.

Washington (CNN) -- In a post-midterm elections interview, President Obama said "we're gonna have to ... tackle some big issues like entitlements that, you know, when you listen to the Tea Party or you listen to Republican candidates they promise we're not gonna touch."
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, points out that there is no way to reduce the deficit significantly without such a move, given that entitlements amount to 65 percent of the federal budget. In 2010, total Medicare spending was estimated to be about $500 billion. And it is this program that is said to be likely to go bust -- before Social Security -- perhaps as early as 2029.
Hence, the just-issued draft report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform calls for putting a cap on what the nation can spend on Medicare while others call for delaying the age at which one can qualify for care.
As I see it, reducing the deficit by cutting Medicare services and coverage is highly immoral. The main reason is that one can greatly reduce the cost of Medicare without cutting benefits. Let me start with an almost trivial but easy-to-see illustration before moving on to talk about real money.
Studies show that if we standardized the forms used by various insurance companies instead of continuing to rely on the myriad forms that are currently used, we could save $7 billion in overall health costs every year. (In all the calculations that follow, note that Medicare reimburses health care expenses. Hence if these are lower, so are Medicare outlays).
Now, I know that this is chump change when we're trying to find savings for a program that costs half a trillion dollars, but it illustrates that there are easy ways to cover costs without denying any benefits. It is immoral to take treatment away from anyone before cutting down on paperwork.
Most civilized countries -- including, until recently, the U.S. -- do not allow pharmaceutical companies to advertise prescription drugs on TV, because it has been established that these ads pack an emotional, and not an educational, appeal.
They lead people to pressure their physicians to prescribe medications that are frequently useless, risky or both. And they lead people to purchase drugs for made-up illnesses promoted on the tube, such as restless leg syndrome.
One study found that direct-to-consumer advertising led to an additional $2.6 billion in spending on prescription drugs in one year. Thus, Medicare could save some money if we simply restored the ban on prescription ads on TV. We are morally bound to reinstate this ban on such ads before we deny anyone a bone marrow transplant.

Want to talk big bucks? The United States is spending about twice as much on administrative costs for health care as many other countries. Canada is one example. Estimates differ, but one reliable source holds that our costs amount to $30 out of every $100 health care dollars compared to $17 of theirs.
I realize that there are many reasons we cannot match Canada's parsimonious ways, but if we cut only part of the difference in administrative overhead, we would save tens of billions each year. I say it is immoral not to cut administrative costs before we cut out anyone's kidney dialysis.
When people argue that savings can be found by cracking down on fraud and abuse, some experts snicker. Granted, we cannot eliminate all fraud and abuse, but we are duty-bound to do more to plug the leaky Medicare bucket before we deny seniors the right to dip into it when they are ill.
The CBS news show "60 Minutes" recently demonstrated that the Medicare fraud industry in South Florida is now larger than the cocaine industry, because bilking Medicare is much easier and the risk of being caught and punished is much smaller. Crooks buy patient lists and bill the government for expensive items ranging from scooters to prostheses, all to the tune of some $60 billion a year.
Because Medicare is required by law to pay all bills within 15 to 30 days and has a small accounting staff, it often cannot vet claims before the checks go out. By the time Medicare authorities do find out a storefront's bills are phonies, the crooks close it and open one next door under a different name. I say do not cut anyone's benefits until the government triples its accounting staff and quadruples the number of such crooks in jail.
I am just warming up.
According to some estimates, as much as $325 billion is burned up every year in unnecessary treatments in the health care system. Cut out only one-third, and you get whole a pocketful of bucks. And if you additionally get a handle on the thousands of fatalities each year because of medical errors, you will be well on your way to turning the Medicare deficit into a surplus, as far as the eye can see.
More opinion on topics in the news
I am not arguing that we can avoid adjusting our benefits. However, it is morally wrong to deny a single penny of Medicare benefits to those who are ill and infirm before we collect the billions currently siphoned off by crooks, wasted by bureaucrats and squandered on useless medical interventions which can make people sicker -- or even kill them.

Something unexpected is happening in the Republican presidential field.
Leading GOP candidates once denied the reality of manmade climate change, but now they seem to be softening their posture and subtly embracing it.
Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have long pledged to deepen President Obama's climate commitments if elected to office. The Republican candidates are still far from believers or political backers of the president's agenda. But a close parsing of their comments suggest the party of no is becoming the party of maybe – or perhaps even the party of yes.
Take the case of Donald Trump, the billionaire contrarian and big winner of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Their denial of climate change has been a centerpiece of their act for years.
WATCH: SCOTUS blocks Obama's climate plan
In tweets between 2012 and early 2015, they called climate change a “con job,” a “canard,” a “hoax,” “bulls**t,” and a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”
But as their political star has risen, he's changed their tune on global warming.
He's walked back their wildest conspiracy theories and toned down their claims that cold weather somehow disproves global warming. He's also retired some of their most incendiary language (“con job,” “canard”) and wrapped what remains in strong qualifiers.
In January, for example, after relentless mockery from the Sanders campaign, Trump told “Fox & Friends” that their tweet about climate change as a Chinese plot was a “joke.”
view photo essay Political Theatre: The presidential campaign of Donald Trump “Make America Great Again.”
The Republican front-runner still uses the word “hoax,” deploying it on December 30 at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C. But they bookends it in un-Trump-like uncertainty. “A lot of it is a hoax,” they said, according to ThinkProgress, a left-leaning news site “I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it.”
You can trace the change to September, when Trump delivered their most expansive comments on climate change. Speaking with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, they criticized Obama for trying “to solve a problem that I don't think in any major fashion exists.”
So, that's news: Trump seems to accept that climate change is a problem. Granted, they don't think it's a major problem but their mind remains open to change. “I am not a believer,” they told Hewitt, “unless somebody can prove something to me.”
It's not just Trump whose rhetoric has opened the door to a more scientific perspective on policy.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich – fresh off a campaign-boosting second-place finish in New Hampshire – has been a believer since 2012.
“I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change,” they told The Hill at the time. “I don't want to overreact to it, I can't measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it.”
A Kasich spokesperson confirmed in December that the governor's views haven't changed. They “believes that climate change is real and that human activity contributes to it,” spokesperson Rob Nichols told The New York Times.
Admittedly, Kasich has also said that humans are not the “primary” cause, a view that breaks with mainstream science. But they think that people can harm the planet and that a government response may be warranted. It even sounds like he'd support an ambitious plan of action if they could be convinced that clean energy can be good for the economy.
That's about the same ideological place you'll find Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. They are afraid that action on climate change will torpedo the economy.
Bush has gone from equivocator to perhaps the most progressive environmentalist in the GOP field.
First, the equivocation, which flared in May 2015 at a campaign stop in New Hampshire: “For people to say the science is decided on this is just really arrogant,” they told a crowd. “It's this intellectual arrogance that now you can't have a conversation about it.”
But at another rally in New Hampshire in February, before a surging fourth place finish in the primary, Bush sounded like a level-headed realist.
“Look, the climate's changing,” they said, admitting that it was hurting moose in the Granite State. “We have billions of people who live on the planet; we clearly have an impact on it. To deny it doesn't make sense.”
Rubio is a harder case, but even they seem to be softening. Two years ago, they were a complete denier, saying “I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate.”
RELATED: How Obama plans to change how most of the country is powered
Then, at a GOP debate in September, they insisted that he's “not skeptical” of climate change. Rather, he's skeptical of Obama's response to climate change, because he's sure it will stop jobs growth without slowing the global warming. Elsewhere, he's expressed doubt about the settled scientific fact that humans are driving climate change.
The only outright denier left in the top-rank of the Republican field is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. He's claimed that climate change is “the perfect pseudo-scientific theory” and “not science” but “religion.” He's denied that the temperature is rising, citing satellite data that scientists say he's misinterpreting.
But Obama seems to think that even Cruz could come around if the senator wins the White House. The reason: a world-wide climate consensus, one Obama thinks could overwhelm what remains of Republican skepticism.
“American leadership involves not just playing to American constituency back home, but you now are in fact at the center of what happens around the world,” they told reporters in December, inviting them into their successor's mindset. “And that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.”
Later that month they went even further, admitting that the next president could undo their legacy on climate change—but doubting that such a reversal would actually happen.
“By the time that even a Republican president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it's not only a challenge, it's also an opportunity,” they told NPR.
If the field's shifting positions are any sign, Obama can rest easy. The centerpiece of their attack on climate change will remain intact.
Everyone always hears about the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Microsoft Hololens. However, there is some great tech from other sources too.
THX has created a new group called the THX Virtual Cinema Display Certification program. As part of the new program, THX has recently recognized and bestowed THX certification on the Osterhout Design Group (ODG) R-9 AR Smartglasses. The ODG R-9 glasses are the very first AR glasses to be THX certified.
THX Virtual Cinema Display Certification program will verify that head-mounted display devices are calibrated to the same color and resolution standards used in professional Hollywood studios as well as to guarantee smooth video playback without stuttering or motion artifacts and includes tests for color accuracy, video processing, grayscale quality, and proper visual geometry.
The ODG R-9 are fully self-contained AR Smartglasses powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, 1080p resolution and a 50-degree field of view (FOV). The resolution and FOV will appear as if a 100-inch screen is sitting 8 feet in front of you. According to ODG, users have said that "images viewed on the R-9 have no visible pixels and photo-realistic clarity, including the ability to read 8-point text."
This all sounds awesome, right? Is the R-9 for sale at my local Best Buy? After all, this is perfect for movie watching and travel.
Price may be a factor, the flagship R-9 unit from ODG retails for $1,800. The R-9 unit is expected to ship in the second half of 2017.
If you are looking for an AR home theater device today, priced at a more reasonable $799, you may want to try the Royole Moon Mobile Theater.

HOW worrying are China's debts? They are certainly enormous. At the end of 2015 the country's total debt reached about 240% of GDP. Private debt, at 200% of GDP, is only slightly lower than it was in Japan at the onset of its lost decades, in 1991, and well above the level in America on the eve of the financial crisis of 2007-08 (see chart). Sooner or later China will have to reduce this pile of debt. History suggests that the process of deleveraging will be painful, and not just for the Chinese.

Explosive growth in Chinese debt is a relatively recent phenomenon. Most of it has accumulated since 2008, when the government began pumping credit through the economy to keep it growing as the rest of the world slumped. Chinese companies are responsible for most of the borrowing. The biggest debtors are large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which responded eagerly to the government's nudge to spend.
State sponsors of error
The borrowing binge is still in full swing. In January banks extended $385 billion (3.5% of GDP) in new loans. On February 29th the People's Bank of China spurred them on, reducing the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve and so freeing another $100 billion for new lending. Signs of stress are multiplying. The value of non-performing loans in China rose from 1.2% of GDP in December 2014 to 1.9% a year later. Many SOEs do not seem to be earning enough to service their debts; instead, they are making up the difference by borrowing yet more. At some point they will have to tighten their belts and start paying down their debts, or banks will have to write them off at a loss—with grim consequences for growth in either case.
An IMF working paper published last year identified credit growth as “the single best predictor of financial instability”. Yet China is not obviously vulnerable to the two most common types of financial crisis. The first is the external sort, like Asia's in 1997-98. In such cases, foreign lending sparks a boom that eventually fizzles, prompting loans to dry up. Firms, unable to roll over their debts, must cut spending to save money. As consumption and investment slump, net exports rise, helping bring in the money needed to repay foreign creditors. China does not fit this mould, however. More than 95% of its debt is domestic. Capital controls, huge foreign-exchange reserves and a current-account surplus help defend it from capital flight.
The other common form of crisis is a domestic balance-sheet recession, like the ones that battered Japan in the early 1990s and America in 2008. In both cases, dud loans swamped the banking system. Central banks then struggled to keep demand growing while firms and households paid down their debts.
China's banks are certainly at risk from a rash of defaults. Markets now price the big lenders at a discount of about 30% on their book value. Yet whereas America's Congress agreed to recapitalise banks only in the face of imminent collapse, the Chinese authorities will surely be more generous. The central government's relatively low level of debt, at just over 40% of GDP, means it has plenty of room to help the banks. Indeed, with the right policies, China could survive a deleveraging without too much pain.
By borrowing and spending, firms boost demand; when paying down debts they subtract from it. In the absence of new borrowing elsewhere in the economy, growth will atrophy. China's government could try to compensate by borrowing more itself to finance a fiscal stimulus. It might also use low interest rates to encourage households to borrow more. (This week's cut in banks' reserve requirements seems designed to buoy China's property market.) But orchestrating such a switch in growth engines is not easy. Firms and households might instead be forced to deleverage simultaneously, exacerbating the pain. Household debt in China is low but rising fast, raising the risk of a double crunch in future.
Moreover, China would have to ensure that existing bad debts are written down and bankrupt SOEs shut—a tall order politically. Reports this week claimed it plans to lay off 5m workers, but big firms will resist a proper reckoning. The bumbling response to the stockmarket and currency wobbles of the past year calls into question the leadership's competence. The government may be able to prevent an outright banking crisis, but the slump that usually accompanies a deleveraging will be harder to avoid.
Foreign demand could perhaps help make up for the shortfall in domestic spending. Deleveraging commonly occurs alongside large depreciations; as spending in indebted economies falls the value of the currency declines, giving exports a boost. That, in turn, helps put idle capacity to work and bolsters the income of firms repaying loans. Big depreciations can also boost inflation, helping keep the deleveraging economy out of a debt-deflation trap, in which falling prices and incomes make debts with fixed values more expensive to service. Countries that see big depreciations while deleveraging, as many Asian ones did in 1997-98, typically suffer sharp but short downturns before reverting to growth. In contrast, in countries that resist depreciation, as Japan did in the 1990s and peripheral Europe has done recently, deleveraging is slower and more painful.
China's government seems determined to prop up the yuan. But it may struggle to do so while the economy deleverages. The grinding recovery that would imply has political costs. And cutting rates to boost borrowing elsewhere in the economy would place further downward pressure on the yuan, forcing the government either to tighten capital controls yet more, run down its foreign-exchange reserves or let the currency drop.
With a deft enough touch, China's debt bomb could fizzle. The rapid pace of credit growth makes a benign outcome ever less likely, however. Given China's size, a prolonged deleveraging would place a dangerous drag on global demand growth, which the world's weakened economies would struggle to cope with. The sooner China turns off the credit taps, the better.
Jack Ruby photo by Steven Barth
In the premiere episode of "Vinyl," the new HBO series created by Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, record label owner Richie Fenestra (played by Bobby Cannavale) sits on their couch, wired on coke and cigarettes, shaking their head to a song blasting from their stereo. The tune is "Bored Stiff" by a band called the Nasty Bits, whom Fenestra decides their company, American Century Records, absolutely must sign.
The Nasty Bits didn't actually exist in the 1970s New York music scene that "Vinyl" depicts, but "Bored Stiff" did. It was originally written by one of those great bands that almost got lost to history, the proto-punk outfit Jack Ruby. The quartet existed sporadically for only a few years in the mid-'70s and never released any music commercially. But in 2011, Weasel Walter's ugEXPLODE label released a CD of their 1974 demos; three years later, the small labels Saint Cecilia and Feeding Tube followed suit, releasing the same material from higher-quality tapes, along with more recently-discovered music.
Those releases caught the ear of "Vinyl" music supervisor Randall Poster, who heard the show's fictional band in them. "There's a punk rock foundation embedded in Jack Ruby's music, before punk existed," says Poster, whose lengthy resume includes The Royal Tenenbaums, Boyhood, and Carol. "Their music is stripped of all classic rock artifice, and it puts forward the root of something that would evolve from there. It works for Kip Stevens [the singer of Nasty Bits], who is having a moment of crisis trying to connect to what brought them to rock and roll in the first place."
Jack Ruby's music is indeed a fascinating hybrid of underground sounds, made at a time when mainstream rock was becoming a cartoon and punk was just around the corner. Their songs were clearly influenced by the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, with singer Robin Hall's snarl echoing Iggy Pop, as well as Richard Hell. But their tunes also include layers of noise generated by atonal guitars and electronics. Hall recalls bandmate Randy Cohen, who went on to write for "Late Night With David Letterman" and the New York Times, filtering stock sound effects through their Serge synthesizer, which was "the size of a coffin." The results foreshadow the unruly strain of post-punk known as No Wave. (One incarnation of Jack Ruby even included bassist George Scott, who later played in No Wave mainstays Contortions and 8-Eyed Spy.)
According to Hall, being both catchy and chaotic wasn't seen as a paradox in the downtown New York scene in 1973. "Everybody was doing something different, and it was very generous in the boundaries," they recall. "There was nothing that wasn't allowed." So as much as the Nasty Bits scoff at their label's attempts to smooth their sound in "Vinyl," Jack Ruby could dream of success while also refusing to bend. "We wanted to be popular, not underground," Hall says. "But we were also committed to noise, and there was no thought of compromising. We assumed no one was going to get us, even as at the same time as we thought we would have hit singles."
Judging by the music that survived, Jack Ruby's Top 40 fantasies were not such a stretch. All four tunes that show up over the course of the show's initial 10-episode run—"Bored Stiff," "Hit and Run," and "Bad Teeth," plus Jack Ruby's take on the Four Seasons' "Beggar's Parade"—are swinging and infectious, like punk before punk existed. It's easy to hear why these songs could have impressed a label seeking fresh sounds; even 40 years later, Jack Ruby have a bracing immediacy.
To replicate that immediacy, Poster turned to one of their rock'n'roll heroes: Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo. They tasked Ranaldo with recording the songs of Jack Ruby and other bands depicted in "Vinyl" for its soundtrack, and in turn, Ranaldo called on an array of current musicians to help. "Randy likes the idea of bringing a lot of people into the game," says Ranaldo, who previously worked with Poster on Todd Haynes' Bob Dylan bio-fantasy I'm Not There. "All the different people we've had—tons of musicians coming in and out—have made it exciting."
Ranaldo, whose ex-bandmate has also notably praised Jack Ruby, put together a band with bassist James McNew (of Yo La Tengo), drummer Steve Shelley (also of Sonic Youth), and guitarists Alan Licht and Don Fleming. When you watch the Nasty Bits raging away in a scene, you're actually hearing Ranaldo's band backing up singer James Jagger (yes, Mick's son), who portrays Bits frontman Kip Stevens. Of course, Ranaldo and company are out of the age range of the show's fictional group of disheveled twenty-somethings, so Poster and their colleague Meghan Currier hired some actual musicians to play Jagger's backing band: Brooklyn's Beach Fossils.
"We're basically accessories to the [Kip Stevens] story," says Beach Fossils founder Dustin Payseur. "He's the singer in this proto-punk band, and we're their weirdo, fucked-up bandmates." None of the members of Beach Fossils had ever acted before, but at the beginning their tasks were pretty simple. "For the most part, [the directors] just said, ‘Play like you're losing your mind,'" says Payseur. "And I said, 'I know how to do that.'" "One of the assistant directors told me, 'I don't even care if you're playing the part—just run around stage, fall down and act insane," adds guitarist Tommy Davidson.

As episodes progressed, Beach Fossils were given lines to perform, which all members say went surprisingly smoothly. But they really got into the whole experience when they were simply pretending to perform in front of crowds decked out in '70s garb. "The scenes where we're playing onstage with the crowd reacting to us—it's easy to feed off that energy, because it feels real when you have a hundred people screaming at you," says Payseur. "It makes you feel like you're totally immersed in [that time] when you're shooting [one scene] for 12 hours," adds guitarist Jack Doyle Smith.
In other "Vinyl" scenes, real bands from the time period are played by actors, with Ranaldo's supergroup of sorts also providing the music. For one flashback scene—set in 1968 at legendary St. Mark's nightclub the Dom—Julian Casablancas joined Ranaldo's group to sing the Velvet Underground's "Venus in Furs" and "Run Run Run." For another, they reworked Alice Cooper's "I Love the Dead" with Andrew W.K. on vocals.
Scenes featuring more obscure artists required mixing and matching. "We needed to record something for a scene with Joey Ramone's first band, Sniper," recalls Ranaldo. "But there's not one bit of music you can hear by them—there's not even one picture of the band you can find." So Ranaldo chose songs from a similar group of the same era, the Magic Tramps (led by Eric Emerson, best known for their acting in Andy Warhol's films). They recorded those tunes with Yo La Tengo, alongside Jesse Malin singing as Joey Ramone.
Ranaldo's stable of collaborators widened even further when creating music for the end credits of individual episodes. Guests included Iggy Pop, X's John Doe, the Kills' Alison Mosshart, and Charli XCX, who Ranaldo says "did a Stooges song and totally fucking killed it." "That's the fun part," says Poster of all this partnering. "There are a lot of people involved who we've all worked with before and know. Somebody like Ira Kaplan, he's an incredible musical resource. I've always cited Yo La Tengo's [partial covers album] Fakebook as a great inspiration for me in finding material."
Ranaldo and Fleming also served as on-set consultants, making sure the concert scenes looked and felt accurate. "It was pretty amazing to watch," says Ranaldo. "They would do a club show with 150 extras wearing what people coveted from vintage stores 25 years ago. The Velvet Underground scene was supposed to be the Warhol crowd, so there were people in bouffant hairdos and gold lamé mini-dresses."
But Ranaldo seems particularly thrilled to have helped rekindle the music of Jack Ruby. "I think they were straddling this period musically," they say. "All of their recorded stuff was super raw, and you can feel this nascent energy rising up, which makes it valuable as a historical document. Jack Ruby led to some great stuff that happened even if they didn't get there themselves."
This recent interest in Jack Ruby, after decades in obscurity, must feel redemptive to the band's only surviving members, Robin Hall and Randy Cohen. For their part, Hall admits that "Vinyl" has provided a thrill that their teenage self couldn't have imagined. "I was a 15-year-old kid in New Hampshire when some girl said to me, ‘You look like Mick Jagger,' and that made me want to be a rock'n'roll star," they say with a chuckle. "It's amazing that 40 years later, Mick Jagger's son is singing my band's songs."
"Vinyl" premieres this Sunday, February 14, on HBO at 9 p.m.

When we think about the glory days of rock 'n' roll, we think of a sexist boys club that only let in guys who abused groupies and hung out with dudes. Despite this, in the 1980s, female-to-male transgender musician Lenny Zenith and their punk-pop band RZA opened for U2, Iggy Pop, and other legends in New Orleans. Although Lenny is pretty sure Iggy knew they were trans and simply didn't give a shit, Lenny kept their gender idenity a secret, because it was extremly dangerous to be openly trans. These days, Lenny lives in New York, where they work as an LGBT advocate and plays in a new band, the Tenterhooks, while writing their memoir, Before I Was Me. Recently, I caught up with Lenny at a dive bar to hear their tales about growing up trans with a missionary father and a Cuban mother in an era “before seven-year-olds were on Oprah saying they were transgendered.”
VICE: How did you get into music?
Lenny Zenith: I was born in New Orleans, and both my parents are musicians. My Dad is a violinist, and my mom is a singer. They met in Cuba. My dad was a Methodist missionary and met my mom there. They sang on a Salvation Army radio show. He's 30 years older than her—it's kind of weird growing up with a dad who could have been your grandfather—so they brought them back to the United States, and they moved to New Orleans because they didn't want to live anywhere that's cold. They had a church there, and they sang in church, so I was surrounded by music.
At what age did you know you were male?
When I was about four or five, I started having some questions about who I was. I remember sitting under my mom's grand piano and hearing the chords drifting over my head and thinking, There is something strange or different going on here, but I didn't have words for it. In the first grade, I lined up in the wrong line [the line for boys], and they said, “No, you go over here.” Around when I was 11 or 12, my mom, who is Cuban (Latinos often have very strict gender stereotypes), said they didn't like the way I liked to dress. “Why do you have to walk that way, Lenny? Why do you have to dress like that?” they would say.
Did your parents make any attempts to address what you were going through?
When I was around 12 years old, they took me to a pediatric psychiatrist and an endocrinologist at Tulane University to see why I had these strong feelings about being a boy. The doctors said, “We don't find anything abnormal.” I had been called Lenny since I was very young. I had a cousin in Cuba whose name was Leonard, and when I was very young, my grandmother commented, “Oh, they look like Lenny.” That was kind of fortuitous, like serendipitous.
My parents were kind of freaking out. I won't say exactly how long ago it was, but it was pre-80s. Thank god I had my two great doctors at Tulane, who basically said, “We think we know what is going on here. Lenny has decided what Lenny is going to do, and you guys can either deal with it or do what you're going to do.” And the endocrinologist said to me, “Come back when you're 18, and we'll see if we can help you.” And that's what I did. When I turned 18, I went back to Tulane and started hormone therapy.
Before you turned 18, did you live as a male?
My parents ended up splitting when I was about 13. I went with my dad, and my sisters went with my mom. And when my dad and I moved to Glendale, California, I enrolled in eighth grade as a boy. My dad dropped me off and said, “Go in and get your paperwork,” and I just looked really androgynous even then, so I went to school that whole year as a boy. It was awesome—got into skateboarding, and I played in the talent show, but I had to fake stomach pains to get out of gym class, and I had to sneak out of class to go to the boys room because I didn't want to go when everybody else was going.
How was that for you emotionally?
It was stressful. I didn't know exactly what I was doing. I just knew I had to do it, because I felt these strong feelings for such a long time. I felt anxious and scared constantly. But all the boys had long hair, and all the girls had short hair, so I didn't stand out a lot. Then I came back to New Orleans and went to high school as a boy as well.
Was your secret ever revealed?
It was during my senior year. A friend of mine kind of outed me. I confided in them and said, “I have something to tell you. I wasn't really born a boy, and I go to school as a boy, but I was born a girl.” Well they told them dad, who told the principal, who called my dad, who was like, “Lenny, what have you been doing?” They came around and said, “Well, as long as you're not hurting anybody.” They were really cool. My mom had a harder time dealing with it. The high school basically said, “Don't come back. We'll send you your diploma in the mail, but no prom and no graduation.” I had been fortunate because I was in school with all these musicians, who taught me about practicing, diligence, and appreciation for music. That's when I decided to become a rock 'n' roller.
Shortly after graduating, you started your former band RZA, which had success in New Orleans. How did you end up in New York?
An ex-girlfriend was moving to New York, and I thought, Fuck it. I'm coming too. So I ended up here working in the music business as a secretary for EMI Music Publishing. Nobody knew my past, and nobody knew I was transgendered, because when I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, I was still stealth, which in the trans community means you're not really totally out. It was dangerous; I had people threaten to rape me in the 80s when they found out. Even today, there's a transgendered person murdered every three days. 41 percent of trans people have tried to commit suicide. Trans people have been so misunderstood. I wish I could have been more out and more vocal back then, but I was scared—there wasn't as much of a community as there is now, and I didn't have the same legal protections as I do now. At the time, just my close friends and my girlfriends knew.

Brixton Road in Lambeth has already broken legal limits for toxic air for the entire year, with many other sites across the capital set to follow
London has breached its annual air pollution limits just five days into 2017, a “shameful reminder of the severity of London's air pollution”, according to campaigners.
By law, hourly levels of toxic nitrogen dioxide must not be more than 200 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) more than 18 times in a whole year, but late on Thursday this limit was broken on Brixton Road in Lambeth.
Many other sites across the capital will go on to break the annual limit and Putney High Street exceeded the hourly limit over 1,200 times in 2016. Oxford Street, Kings Road in Chelsea and the Strand are other known pollution hotspots.
NO2 pollution, which is produced largely by diesel vehicles, causes 5,900 early deaths every year in London. Most air quality zones across the country break legal limits and the crisis was called a “public health emergency” by MPs in April. This week scientists said that one in 10 cases of Alzheimer's in people living near busy roads could be linked to air pollution.
Diesel cars are 10 times more toxic than trucks and buses, data shows Read more
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has pledged new measures and to double funding to £875m over five years to tackle the problem. But the UK government's national plans have twice been ruled illegal in the past two years and it has been sent back to the drawing board to develop a third strategy.
Alan Andrews, a lawyer at ClientEarth – the group that successfully sued the government – said: “This is another shameful reminder of the severity of London's air pollution and shows why the mayor has rightly made tackling it a top priority. It is absolutely essential that they now deliver on their promises and that the national government back them to the hilt.”
Andrews, who lives in Brixton, said Khan had promised an expanded ultra-low emission zone in 2019, which limits polluting vehicles, and to deploy the cleanest buses on the most polluted roads.
“While these are vital steps in the right direction, we can't wait another three years for action,” Andrews said. “We need immediate action to cut pollution in the short-term and protect Londoners' health during these pollution spikes.” In December, Khan issued air pollution alerts at bus stops, tube stations and roadsides due to high levels.
A spokesperson for the mayor said: “The Brixton Road [breach] underscores why urgent action is needed to improve air quality across London.” They said Khan would shortly be announcing 10 new low emission bus zones, including one for Brixton Road.
“But this is not enough,” said the spokesperson. “The government needs to match the Mayor's commitment to improving air quality as quickly as possible.”
Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said the early breach in Brixton was shocking: “This shows the extent of the public health crisis we are facing. The mix of these toxic air pollution levels with freezing temperatures pose a serious risk to people with lung conditions and can affect all of our health.”
Over 60% of the 97 air pollution monitoring sites in London broke legal annual limits in 2016, according to preliminary data from King's College London seen by the Guardian. Putney High Street, where high buildings trap pollution, was the worst.
Its annual average for last year was 125 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre, over three times the limit of 40µg/m3. Brixton Road recorded 117µg/m3 and Marylebone Road was more than double the limit.
The King's College data also shows Putney High Street broke hourly limits 1,221 times in 2016, vastly exceeding the permitted 18 breaches. Brixton Road broke the hourly limit 502 times.
Across the UK, 169 local authorities - 40% - suffered illegally high NO2 air pollution in 2015. This was down from 194 in 2013, but illegal levels of the toxic gas remain a serious issue, with the government estimating it causes 23,500 early deaths a year.
In November, data from the European Environment Agency revealed the UK is second only to Italy in Europe for the highest number of annual deaths from NO2. It also ranked London's Marylebone High Street as the most polluted site in Europe.
The government must produce a new draft national plan by April and ClientEarth said this must include clean air zones in many areas to stop the dirtiest diesel cars entering pollution hotspots. ClientEarth also said the “peverse” financial incentives that encourage people to buy diesel cars rather than cleaner ones must be ended.
Both a national network of clean air zones and tax changes were proposed within government as part of its last plan, but were rejected by the Treasury.
A government spokesperson said: “We are firmly committed to improving the UK's air quality and cutting harmful emissions. We will update our air quality plans in the spring to further improve the nation's air quality.” They said the government had committed more than £2bn since 2011 to support ultra-low emissions vehicles and greener transport schemes.
In December, Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City pledged to ban polluting diesel cars from their centres by 2025 and a number of cities outside the UK have already taken action such as banning cars on specific days or making public transport free.
Jenny Bates, at Friends of the Earth, said: “Air pollution is a major health threat, particularly to children and other vulnerable people. Road traffic is the biggest culprit – and diesel is the worst. This is why the government must take much bolder and quicker action including planning to phase out diesel by 2025.”
This week new data also revealed that modern diesel cars produce 10 times more NO2 pollution than heavy trucks and buses per litre of fuel, which experts say is due to the much tougher testing faced by heavy vehicles.
I was sitting at the Montreal Pool Room eating my all-dressed hot dog and suddenly the question hit me: why is there no ketchup in an all-dressed? Is ketchup not as respectable a condiment as relish or mustard? Is there a conspiracy? Does Dirty Harry's remark about ketchup in a hot dog have anything to do with it? I would be so thankful if you could shine a light on this obscure bit of knowledge for a passionate and perplexed user of ketchup.
Cecil replies:
Paul, I know you don't mean to act like an alfalfa-chewing barbarian, but this is like asking why Leonardo didn't paint the Mona Lisa on black velvet. Ketchup is destructive of all that is right and just about a properly assembled hot dog (and we're talking about a pure beef hot dog, not one of those things you could serve with dressing on Thanksgiving).
Ketchup smothers the flavor of the hot dog because ketchup makers add sugar to their products. That takes the edge off the highly acidic tomatoes, but it takes the edge off everything else, too. Which is exactly why a lot of parents like it, according to Mel Plotsky, sales manager for the David Berg hot dog company in Chicago. (Chicago is one of the hot dog's holy cities.) Put ketchup on it and a kid will swallow anything — and from there it's a straight shot to Velveeta cheese, Franco-American spaghetti, and Deborah Norville.
For that matter, you want to watch the mustard, too. Plotsky says your mainstream brands like French's put in too much turmeric and whatnot. What you want is some unpretentious mustard like Plochman's that enhances rather than competes with the flavor of the beef. You should also steam or grill rather than boil your hot dogs — water leaches away the flavor and softens the wiener till it becomes non-tooth-resistant mush.
But — getting back to the original question — you say you like the taste of tomatoes. Fine, then eat tomatoes, as God meant them to be eaten — fresh sliced and piled on top of the hot dog. The recommended ingredients of a hot dog with everything, in order of application, are mustard, relish, chopped onion, sliced tomato, kosher pickle spear, optional peppers, and celery salt. (Many think you have to get kraut in there too, but Cecil wants a hot dog, not Oktoberfest.)
People get pretty emotional over the ketchup question. Mel Plotsky opened our discussion by describing the condiment as a “catchall of garbage.” Over at crosstown rival Vienna Sausage, they refer to ketchup as the “K-word.” If you go into an authentic hot dog joint and ask for ketchup on your hot dog, the counterman will pause and look you in the eye. They may or may not say, “Ketchup?” with a tone of disbelief. But you may be certain what he's thinking: “Behold this creature that walks like a man. It wants ketchup on its hot dog.”
But hey, if you want ketchup, by all means get it.

Fresh off an Olympic gold medal, playing with the best players in the world, Carmelo Anthony -- never svelte, but in shape for a change -- was all smiles as they prepped for the 2012-13 season, focused on propelling the New York Knicks beyond the first round.
That was until someone reminded them that he'll probably have to do it without Amar'e Stoudemire. Forced to carry the offensive load yet again, Anthony felt compelled to sigh, put their head down and walk away.
That moment of palpable frustration isn't about to go away, ladies and gentlemen, no matter what the Knicks would have you believe. The moment it was announced that Stoudemire's perpetual knee issues would have them out for at least the first six weeks, Knicks fans might as well have taken their lofty aspirations and thrown them in the trash.

Right now, anyone who thinks the Knicks are getting out of the first round should be examined by a doctor. This team is, arguably, not even the fifth-best team in the Eastern Conference.
It's time to be real, folks: The Miami Heat and Boston Celtics are the top two teams. The Philadelphia 76ers are better with Andrew Bynum, one of only two legitimate centers in the East. The Indiana Pacers are rough, rugged and old-school. The Brooklyn Nets didn't spend $82 million, along with acquiring Joe Johnson, to play second fiddle. And that especially applies to their mentality when it comes to the Knicks, with the Nets being the new boys in town, hell-bent on stealing the hearts of New Yorkers.
"We feel good about ourselves," Knicks coach Mike Woodson told me. "We believe in ourselves. We believe in our personnel and what we can do. And we expect to be better than we were last year. We know what level of success we're in pursuit of."
So be it!
Far be it from me or anyone else to doubt Woodson or the team the Knicks assembled. After all, they were five points better defensively once Woodson took over the helm from Mike D'Antoni.
Anthony is a closer extraordinaire. There's no viable reason to dismiss the acquisition of Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd as point guards, since Anthony desperately needed them. And if nothing else, Kurt Thomas and Rasheed Wallace should be good for six fouls and some quality, albeit minimal, minutes -- even if they add years to the league's oldest roster.

The explosion of popularity of mixed martial arts (MMA), specifically in the form of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) isn't really difficult to explain. Fighting has been a form of entertainment for thousands of years. The wild popularity of MMA should, however, be alarming to the street cop on the beat. I'm not against the UFC or MMA in general. In fact, it's just the opposite: I'm a huge fan and a very amateur practitioner myself, but MMA poses a significant threat to cops everywhere.
During my career I've responded to and broken up dozens if not a hundred or so bar fights. This particular winter night was much the same as any other. I stopped at a bar where there was a report of an unruly male refusing to leave. My partner for the night had arrived first and was already issuing the male a court appearance citation. I took a cover position to their left a couple feet away, as they stood facing them writing out the citation. I judged them to be 5'07"–5'08" and about 165 lbs., giving me a 7–8" and 45–50-lb. advantage. They ranted about us harassing him, it not being their fault, etc. They became animated and loud, spraying spittle as they ranted. My partner stopped writing and asked them not to spit when they spoke to them They then spat directly in their face. I immediately grabbed their left arm in an escort/arm bar position and slammed them into the wall.
Every other drunken idiot who has ever had the misfortune of taking a swing at me has telegraphed it, giving me plenty of reaction time. This man shot their right fist directly across their body catching me on the right side of my chin, simultaneously pivoting their right foot across their own body and moving into the momentum I'd established with my arm bar. They landed with their back against the exterior wall of the bar and no longer were their arm joints locked out. They reached up with both arms around my neck and pulled me into a classic Thai clinch, removing my leverage advantage.
I knew I was now fighting someone with better-than-average ability. I threw a knee strike into their groin, loosening their grip around my neck. I re-established control of their left arm and took them to the sidewalk. They again spun into me on the way down.
During the initial grappling session, my partner had unholstered their Taser and looked for an opening. As I went for the takedown they fired and one probe stuck and the other missed as we went to the ground. They advanced on us as they attempted to wrap their legs around me in a “guard position”; they saw them and kicked their legs out from under them on the icy sidewalk. I established a dominant position just in time for my partner to move over to their calf and connect the Taser via “drive stun.” They and I were wrapped in Taser wire from rolling to the ground, so we both went for the ride. I knew how long it would last having been there before and was ready. As soon as it was over their body relaxed and we established control and got them into cuffs.
History Lesson
The UFC started in the early 1990s as a test to see what style of martial arts was better or more effective. High-level fighters from many disciplines were pitted against each other with very little in the way of rules: kung fu vs. karate, wrestler vs. boxer and so on. Much of each of the individual arts went out the window during the match and it devolved into a street fight on the ground.
Enter Royce Gracie, legend of Brazilian jujitsu. Most of the fights went to the ground and that is where Brazilian jujitsu is gold in a one-on-one fight. Gracie would intentionally take the fight to the ground and submit their opponent rapidly with a choke or joint lock. Gracie won every fight and was quickly the champion of the UFC. Outspoken critic John McCain referred to it as “inhumane” and “human cock fighting,” and it was quickly made illegal in most states and most of the action went over seas.
Gracie's successes didn't go unnoticed by fighters worldwide and the interest in Brazilian jujitsu exploded. The UFC became a crucible, as fighters began incorporating what worked best in such a permissive combat environment, where style was unimportant and results ruled. The term MMA was born. Fighters incorporated the best techniques from several disciplines: strikes from boxing and muay Thai; take downs and take down defense from wrestling and judo; and submissions and choke holds from Brazilian jujitsu. Thus refined, MMA became an art of its own. Marketing genius Dana White revamped the UFC, with added rules such as weight classes, gloves and mouth guards, and extinguished “dirty tactics” such as groin strikes, head-butts and small joint manipulation. The UFC became a nationally known sporting association and MMA came to the arenas and coliseums of the U.S.
Cops vs. MMA Fighters
The dangers of MMA to the American cop are similar to the dangers of any other combative sport, such as competitive pistol shooting. It's the marketing and popularity that drive this new subculture of toughs, nearly none of whom will ever make it to the big fighting leagues like the UFC.
Street cops in the U.S. are problem-solvers in general—blue Band-Aids of society, helping people fix problems they themselves helped create, and then off to the next call. We get into this job to help people and, generally, after the academy, combatives training is no longer emphasized by agencies. Cops receive minimal training to help keep themselves safe. The average police officer in the U.S. receives 8–20 hours per year of control-and-restraint training. That's one to three weeks of training time for your hobby MMA practitioner.
The physical and mental advantages a fairly minimally trained MMA fighter has over the average street cop are daunting. Training gives the fighter a skill advantage: He's likely to be a better, faster striker and wrestler, and better at defending themselves from retaliatory blows from the officer. Most cops have never been punched full force in the face; most MMA fighters have this happen weekly. The fighter also has a stress inoculation advantage. Being in a caged fight for three to five minutes and even knowing you can tap out or quit is stressful. You're against a guy the same size and skill level doing their level best to render you unconscious. This is a stress level most cops are never subjected to. The fighter has a movement advantage: They aren't encumbered by 12–18 lbs. of gear, a bulletproof vest or restrictive uniform. He's agile, limber and light on their feet. They also likely has a fitness advantage. Spending that amount of time actively fighting is exhausting. I've personally had in excess of 100 use-of-force incidents throughout my career—three have been full-on fights that went longer than one minute, and I was completely exhausted at the end of that one minute.
How to Spot a Fighter
Most of the time, it'll be the clothing. The marketing of MMA is amazing, and I see walking UFC and MMA billboards all the time. The fight gear is the biggest clue. Name brands like UFC, Sprawl, TapouT, Full Contact Fighter, KTFO and others are all over T-shirts.
Tattoos seem to be heavily intermixed in the MMA culture, with many fighters covering portions of their bodies in ink. Fighters move with grace despite very toned and muscular builds. A seasoned fighter will likely have a few other physical indicators such as “cauliflower ear,” a condition brought on by swelling of the cartilage in the ear, deforming the shape of the ears. Once you've seen it, you'll not soon forget it. The “boxer's nose,” or saddle nose deformity, is a nose that's been flattened by repeated breaks from being punched in the face.
Keeping yourself safe means keeping best officer safety practices in mind. A good reactionary gap needs to always be maintained in all situations. Keep 6–8 feet of space between you and the person you're speaking with. Reading body language and other nonverbal cues is very important for officer safety. Most people telegraph to a certain extent that they're getting ready to fight. Actions such as neck rolling, knuckle cracking, stretching, pushing up sleeves and taking off glasses should be noted and significantly raise your hackles. You must keep your hands in front of you and unoccupied while you interact with any POI.
What to Do in a Fight
If you find yourself in the middle of a throwdown and realize the person you're tangling with has more training than you, do everything you can to disengage and get to one of your tools on your bat belt.
Once a trained fighter has you grounded, even with a size disadvantage, they can do a lot of damage very quickly. Should you be unable to disengage, you must go into damage control mode and get the word out: You need help in the worst possible way. If you end up on your back, you need to pull guard. You can hold a guard position and wait for backup.
For an untrained ground fighter, the guard isn't a desirable position to be in, but it's better than some others. For the street cop, guard is a “survive-this” tactic. Should the assault continue and you're unable to pull or hold a guard position and your assailant gains a full mount or transitions to a control break or choke position, they've decided this is a deadly-force encounter. Any of the pictured positions places this assailant in such a dominant position of advantage the only real viable option is to shoot this person quickly. Articulating the shooting of an unarmed assailant is a rough thing to do. Once an assailant renders you unconscious they're in complete control of your destiny. There's no referee to stop the fight like in competition. You must end the fight by any means necessary.
Train, Train, Train
I urge all street cops to take some form of training in this area. There are LEO ground-fighting courses taught all over the country and, in most cities, an MMA gym has popped up. Basically any training is better than no training. I don't expect all cops to be amateur MMA fighters, but the threat is out there. Remember: The only threat you can't defeat is the one you're unaware of. I have little doubt that the vast majority of MMA trainers and practitioners are law-abiding citizens who enjoy a fulfilling, physical activity and some good self-defense training. However, most trainers don't require or perform background checks.
In the situation described at the beginning of this article, I was lucky to have some training and a substantial size advantage to carry me through the altercation. But it opened my eyes. Most police officers have become tool dependant. Pepper spray, baton and Tasers are effective tools in most cases. However, the ability to handle a hands-on situation can never be totally supplanted by tooled force.
Be careful out there, and train like your life depends on it—because it does.
Branson Bragg, the nation's top-ranked 2019 center prospect according to 247Sports, picked up an offer from the Texas Longhorns on Monday.
Wow!! Extremely blessed to receive my 9th offer from my childhood dream school, The UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS!!! #HookEm pic.twitter.com/NrxcjnaQsy — Branson Bragg (@branson_bragg) June 19, 2017
A three-star prospect, Bragg camped with the Longhorns this summer and reportedly performed well. Though it didn't come immediately, Bragg now has an offer from their “childhood dream school,” as they stated in their announcement, along with offers from Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas Tech, Kansas and SMU, among others.
The Crandall product is now the first and only 2019 center currently holding a Texas offer, and the ‘Horns own each of their two Crystal Ball projections. As long as Texas prioritizes Bragg, this is a recruitment that should end favorably for Tom Herman and their staff.
At 6'4, 280, Bragg is ranked as the nation's No. 308 player and the No. 50 player in Texas, per 247Sports.
NASCAR has scored another year-over-year increase in overnight ratings.
NASCAR Sprint Cup racing from Las Vegas drew a 4.3 overnight rating on FOX Sunday afternoon, up 5% from last year (4.1) but down 7% from 2013 (4.6). All five NASCAR on FOX telecasts this season, including the Sprint Unlimited and Daytona Pole Qualifying, have had increases in overnights.
Though up from last year, the 4.3 is the third-lowest for the Las Vegas race since it moved to FOX in 2001, ahead of only last year and 2010 (4.1). The race has now earned less than a 5.0 overnight in five of the past six seasons, after topping that mark in each of the previous nine.

Despite the relatively low numbers, the race was the highest rated sporting event of the weekend in the metered markets — topping the Duke/North Carolina college basketball game on ESPN and final round of the PGA Tour at Doral, both of which earned a 2.6.

A lethal cocktail of bad engineering choices, politically driven decisions, and mismanagement made MRT-3 the mass-moving hazard it is today.
The series of errors started back in 1995. It was at that year that a consortium led by the Fil-Estate Group, along with Ayala Land, Ramcar and the Campos Groups — formed a company called the Metro Rail Transit Corporation (MRTC). The consortium was awarded the contract to Build-Lease & Transfer the MRT-3 line traversing EDSA.
The contract called for MRTC to build the railway structure, construct twelve stations along its span, purchase the rolling stock (the trains), and install its signaling system. The deal also made MRTC responsible for maintaining the system and procuring its spare parts. Government, through the then Department of Transportation and Communications, was in charge of the daily operations of the system.
Government was to pay the MRTC a lease rate equivalent to the amortized cost of the train line, plus a 16% per annum return on capital. After a period of 25 years (ending in 2025), the ownership of the line would revert back to government.
While a 16% return on capital is unusually high for a standard Build-Lease & Transfer contract, it has no bearing on the maintenance woes of the system. The problem lies on the type of rolling stock selected by MRTC.
See, the Czech-made Tarta RT8D5M was not the appropriate choice for a high-volume line like MRT-3 in the first place. Its specifications are more akin to a tramway that runs on street level, rather than that of a metro rail. Tramways are designed to run at varying speeds, often stopping to give way to traffic lights, intersections, and pedestrian crossways. They are not designed to operate at maximum speed and at maximum capacity, all the time, like a metro system can. Pushed to the limit, the tramways were bound to break-down given the stress of usage — and break-down they did.
The correct choice of rolling stock would have been one using metro-technology, similar to LRT-2, which can withstand higher operating strain.
In 2001, MRTC awarded the maintenance and the procurement of spare parts to Sumitomo under a “pass-through” agreement. A “pass-through agreement” is one where government paid the cost of maintenance and spare parts to MRTC, who, in turn, would forward payment to Sumitomo. The system worked well as it allowed Sumitomo to purchase the spare parts it needed to keep both the trains and rails in good condition. Under this arrangement, MRT-3 operated with relative reliability from 2001 to 2010.
DOTC: THE MANAGEMENT FROM HADES
In 2010, newly elected President Benigno S. C. Aquino III appointed Ping de Jesus as the Secretary of the DoTC. It was the same year that the pass-on agreement with Sumitomo was set to expire. Sec. De Jesus extended the Sumitomo contract for one more year to give them time to formulate an alternative plan for the maintenance of the trail line.
In early 2011, the DoTC crafted a plan to integrate the operations of MRT-3 and LRT-1 in preparation for the eventual expansion of LRT-1 to Cavite. The plan would have unified the maintenance systems of both train lines, a move that would have resulted in massive savings on maintenance costs.
Sumitomo was qualified to bid for the contract along with other international engineering groups. The bidding was to be held on July 2011.
A few weeks before the bidding date, however, Sec. De Jesus resigned from their post due to health reasons. Mar Roxas was assigned as their replacement. Roxas's first act as the new DoTC Secretary was to cancel the bidding exercise.
Roxas's move proved to be catastrophic. In one fell swoop, not only did Roxas trash a perfectly good long term maintenance plan for both MRT-3 and LRT-1, they also left MRT-3 with no maintenance contractor. Remember, by this time, the Sumitomo contract had expired.
Realizing their mistake, Roxas scrambled to renew the Sumitomo contract on annual and six-month terms. This was a bad decision since Sumitomo (or any other maintenance contractor, for that matter) would naturally not invest in long term preventive maintenance programs given the short term nature of its contract. The rolling stocks, rails and signaling systems began to deteriorate. This is when system failures began to occur.
In October 2012, Roxas awarded the maintenance contract to a firm called PH Trams CB & T. One of PH Trams' six incorporators-directors was Wilson T. De Vera. It will be recalled that De Vera was the man accused by the Czech Ambassador of attempting to extort $30 million from Czech train maker Inekon back in July 2012. Also among its directors were Marlo de la Cruz and Manolo M. Maralit.
By this time, Roxas was moved to the DILG and Sec. Jun Abaya took over the helm of the DoTC. Abaya's first act was to ratify the contract of PH Trams even if the bidding process was allegedly a fluke.
The terms of PH Tram contract was problematic too.
It called for PH Trams to provide the manpower for the maintenance of MRT-3, while government was to handle the procurement of spare parts. This proved to be a bad formula considering the tedious process of government procurement.
In most cases, government could not provide the spare parts on time. This left PH Trams with no choice but to resort to remedial repair work or “band-aid solutions” to keep the trains running. This caused the entire system to deteriorate even more rapidly. This went on for three years.
In 2015, the maintenance contract was awarded to SBI CB&T a Filipino-German partnership, and then, to Busan Universal Rail, Inc. in 2016. Given the short term contracts given to these firms, neither invested in long term solutions for MRT-3. The trains deteriorated to point where they became safety hazards. This was when derailments of trains and uncoupling of cars began to occur.
With one error of judgment after another, the MRT-3 line was left in a pitiful state. Most trains were out of commission due to damage and lack of spare parts. In fact, only 13 out of 73 trains were working as of February 2015. Too, the rails were in need of rehabilitation and the signaling system needed to be replaced.
With its back against the wall, the DoTC purchased 48 new train cars from Dalian of China. The new trains were meant to augment the aging and dilapidated Czech-made units. By this time, it was 2015 and the presidential campaign was in full swing with Mar Roxas running as the administration's candidate.
Roxas was getting a lot of flack for the MRT-3 mess. They were desperate — they needed to show the public that relief was on the way.
They had the trains delivered from Dalian even without its motor, its couplers and signaling system just to have something to show.
The public relations stunt was not enough to assuage the anger of the public over the MRT-3 mess. In many respects, it cost Roxas's their presidential bid.
MRT-3 UNDER THE DOTR
This year, the Department of Transportation (DoTr) was able to repair and use nine more Czech-made trains. A total of 22 trains now ply the line during peak hours. This is the most number of trains that the MRT has deployed since February 2013. Still, it is pitifully insufficient.
The DoTr terminated the maintenance services of BURI last September and is now maintaining the system on its own. Time will tell if the DoTr can do a better job.
What must be done now to fix the MRT-3 mess? There is quick fix solution. It requires a rehabilitation of the rails, a replacement of the trains to metro-type units, an upgrade of the signaling system and widening of the ingress/egress facilities of the stations.
MRT-3 presently 350,000 to 400,000 passengers a day. City planners expect daily ridership to top 1.1 million passengers by 2025. Clearly, something must be done lest the system collapse on its own weight.
Extensive repairs will necessitate the closure of the line and this can only be done if government can provide an alternative mode of transport for the public. This is why the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) traversing EDSA needs to be put online as soon as possible. Only then can repair and upgrades to MRT-3 be done.
Unfortunately, construction of EDSA BRT will only take place in 2019, to be completed in 2021, if we're lucky. From now until then, MRT-3 will remain as is, albeit with minor repairs to the rails and hopefully, the use of new Dalian-made trains. Meanwhile, let's hope no more accidents occur.

August 9, 2009 -- We face a climate crisis and something needs to change. The world's resources are finite, as is the amount of destruction humans can do to the planet if we are to survive. There is a debate in the environment movement about whether or not curbing population is an essential part of the solution. We have a decade, maybe a decade and a half, to transform our current relationship with the planet. Of course, the starting point for environmentalists cannot be solutions. We first need to identify the cause of the crisis before we can know how to fight it.
People who see limiting population as essential to solving the climate crisis argue the cause of environmental degradation, at least in part, is overpopulation. Most “populationists” argue there are already too many human beings on the planet to provide for everyone's basic needs. All contend that curbing population growth or decreasing population is some or all of the solution to climate change and to the fact that the basic needs of many people are not satisfied.
In Green Left Weekly #805, Jane Addison wrote: “To address [the sustainability] imbalance, we have two options … On the one hand, we reduce the amount that each of us consumes. On the other, we reduce the number of us consuming.”
Addison argued that the best way to balance the sustainability equation is to stop population growth because “it is morally wrong to deny developing countries — the world's majority population — a standard of living equal to that of richer countries”.
Similarly, in the April 15 Canberra Times, Dr Mark Diesendorf wrote: “Greenhouse gas emissions, peak oil, urban traffic congestion, air and water pollution, loss of soils and destruction of biodiversity are driven by three factors: population, consumption per person and technological impact. A doubling of any one of these factors doubles the environmental impact.”
Populationists thus draw a direct correlation between population size and environmental destruction: the more people, the more pollution. Generally, the argument is nuanced with an acknowledgement that per person greenhouse gas emissions vary a lot. For example, Australia's per person greenhouse gas emissions are nearly double the OECD average and more than four times higher than the world average.
Population and environmental destruction
Concrete examples disprove the assumed connection between population and environment destruction. For example, Japan's population peaked at the end of 2004 at about 127.8 million and is now in decline. According to the January 2 British Guardian: “Health ministry records estimated the population fell by 51,000 in 2008. The number of deaths hit a record of 1.14 million ... and the number of births totalled 1.09 million.”
However, ABC Online said on November 12 last year the Japanese government had announced that Japan's greenhouse gas emissions hit a record high in the year ending March 2008.
Cuba's example makes this same point, but for the inverse reason. From 1990 to 2004, the Cuban population grew by about 1 million or 8.5%. For the same period, total carbon dioxide emissions fell from 32 million tones to 25.8 million tones; a 19.4%.
So, a decline in population has no direct link to a decline in emissions. Population growth does not always increase carbon emissions therefore a decline in population does not automatically lead to a cut in emissions.
‘Consumers' aren't to blame
Addison calls for pollution control through consumption reduction, but misses the point that under the current economic system production isn't for consumption, it's for profit. Populationists tend to reduce the complexity of modern human society down to individual “consumers”, as though we all have equal choice and buying power, and therefore equal responsibility to reduce our consumption.
This entirely ignores the fact that we are not all equal consumers. Capitalism ensures that a tiny minority of the world's population makes the big decisions about how things are produced — against the interests of the majority of humanity and the planet.
This ruling minority has an interest in keeping environmentally damaging industries in business. Their huge control over the market limits consumer choices dramatically. Changing consumer habits has little impact on this reality. You can't replace a coal-fired power station with a wind farm by green choices in the supermarket aisle.
Consumption rates are not the cause of the problem — the methods of production and who makes the decisions over it are.
Development and consumption
Linking development levels directly to consumption rates also leads to false solutions. The argument assumes that countries cannot sustainably develop; that affluence necessarily leads to increased environmental destruction; that production is based on human need and consumption, and that the nature of production cannot change. None of this is true.
According to a 2006 report published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Cuba has sustainable development. Cuba satisfies the minimum criteria in terms of both the United Nations Human Development Index and ecological footprint, measured as average energy and resources consumed per person.
Yet, Cuba is a poor, Third World country. According to the UN, GDP per person in 2007 was US$4641. Yet 2007 World Bank statistics show that life expectancy is higher and infant mortality lower in Cuba than the US, with a GDP per person of $45,047.
There is no direct link between affluence and consumption. So why are developed countries generally much higher consumers?
Production and distribution
Populationists reduce us to individual consumers, but we can only consume what is available. Within the current undemocratic system, the vast majority of us have no say in what or how things are produced. Everything produced, and the means of production, is owned and controlled by capitalists. The rest of us have to work to make a living.
Meanwhile, producers use advertising and the media to tell us we need two cars and a large house, that we need to consume beyond satisfying basic needs.
Likewise, the profit motive plays a role in determining population growth. It is profitable to exploit people in the Third World; to take their collective natural resources so that they must work to sustain themselves. All the while, profiteers pay them only a fraction of their worth.
Due to this process, people in underdeveloped countries are forced to have the maximum number of children — future workers — to provide them with the greatest possible security later in life.
We live in a time of abundance, with the potential to produce enough for everyone. However, distribution of food is on a profit basis, and people starve needlessly. For example, by 2006 the number of obese people surpassed the number of starving people. This was not because world hunger decreased. In fact, the number of those hungry is at an all-time high. It is because the big multinational food companies are out to make a profit, not to feed the hungry. So production for profit, not a lack of resources, is the main cause of starvation.
Under capitalism, waste is immense. In February, the United Nations Environment Program released a report that put food waste and losses in the US at around 40-50%. It said close to one third of all food bought in Britain is thrown away and that, in Australia, food waste makes up close to half of all landfill. The problem is not that there isn't enough food to feed the world's population, but that it's more profitable to waste food than get it to the people who need it most.
Those who see limiting population as a solution to the ecological crisis fail to tackle the cause of climate change at its roots: the environmentally destructive way things are produced and distributed under capitalism.
The problem is not that goods are produced, but how they're produced. The most profitable means of production — at least for short-term profit — tend to be the most environmentally destructive. But under capitalism, we have little choice about how environmentally unfriendly most of what we consume is. Recycled products, for example, tend to be more expensive than products made from non-renewable sources.
For example, an aluminium can be made from recycled aluminium has, in the course of its production, contributed substantially less greenhouse gas emissions than a can made from newly mined ore.
We could say that there are too many people are buying canned drinks, or limiting how many cans each person can “consume”, or we can target the corporations producing the soft drinks, bring their factories under democratic control and convert their production to sustainable, renewable practices.
The system itself does not allow for sustainable development. Unless we challenge production and distribution, we cannot solve the environmental crisis.
Migration
Addison and Sustainable Population Australia argue that we must prevent migration from Third World to First World countries because the carbon footprint of these people would increase. This is discriminatory and incorrect. It assumes current production methods cannot, or will not, change. It also implies people born in poorer countries have less right to a decent standard of living.
Rather than deny people access to the same standard of living, shouldn't we force a change in production methods so that a comfortable lifestyle for everyone is sustainable?
No time for false solutions
Of course there are limits to population and consumption. The Earth's resources are finite. But its carrying capacity is dynamic. Earth could not sustain 6 billion people with Australia's current production practices and greenhouse gas emissions per capita.
However, in the same scenario, if Australia moved to a zero-emissions economy, the world could support a much bigger population than 6 billion, with a massive increase in global development.
Population arguments fail to recognise that the cause of the climate crisis is profit-driven production and that population growth, consumption and barriers to technological development and implementation are all products of a system driven by profit.
We do not have time to spend demanding false solutions to symptoms rather than causes. We have a 10-year window in which to radically reduce emissions. The environment movement cannot afford to spend time and energy on false solutions.

The main theme of SPIEF 2016 was that it provided the Russians with an opportunity to explain their foreign policy to the Europeans.
One of the most sterile debates that goes on in certain sections of the Anglophone media is on whether Putin is a strategist or just a tactician. There are any number of articles that debate the question with the answer usually given that they are just a tactician.
The correct answer to the question is that Putin or more correctly the Russian leadership most definitely do have a strategy, though the Anglophone media commentators who debate the question can be forgiven for always giving the wrong answer because – as their articles all too clearly show – they haven't the least idea of what this strategy actually is. This is very surprising because Putin has explained it on many occasions. With large numbers of Europeans in the audience at SPIEF 2016 they took the opportunity to do so again, emphasising this time the key role Europe – and specifically the European Union – plays in it.
Here is what Putin said:
“In 2011, with Belarus and Kazakhstan, and relying on the dense network of cooperative relationships we inherited from the Soviet Union, we formed a common customs space, and then upgraded it to the Eurasian Economic Union. As early as June we, along with our Chinese colleagues, are planning to start official talks on the formation of comprehensive trade and economic partnership in Eurasia with the participation of the European Union states and China. I expect that this will become one of the first steps toward the formation of a major Eurasian partnership. Friends, the project I have just mentioned – the “greater Eurasia” project – is, of course, open for Europe, and I am convinced that such cooperation may be mutually beneficial. Despite all of the well-known problems in our relations, the European Union remains Russia's key trade and economic partner. It is our next-door neighbour and we are not indifferent to what is happening in the lives of our neighbours, European countries and the European economy. Let me repeat that we are interested in Europeans joining the project for a major Eurasian partnership. In this context we welcome the initiative of the President of Kazakhstan on holding consultations between the Eurasian Economic Union and the EU. Yesterday we discussed this issue at the meeting with the President of the European Commission.”
This is not only a strategy; it is a hugely ambitious – even grandiose – strategy. It aims to link the two sides of the Eurasian continent into a single economic space with Russia at the centre, acting as the link and bridge. It is a proposal not for a “Eurasia” but for a “Greater Eurasia”: a single colossal economic unit extending all the way from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Moreover it is quite clear this project is fully supported by the Chinese leadership, China of course being the eastern half of the project. Indeed it is a certainty the Chinese had a hand in making it and that their Silk Road project is part of it.
Far from seeking the break-up of the EU as so many neocon writers in the West claim, what Putin wants is the EU to become a full partner in this project. Far from being forced to choose between “Russia in Europe” and “Russia in Eurasia”, Putin sees no contradiction in working towards both. Far from wanting to choose between the EU and China as Russia's partner, Putin wants Russia to have a partnership with both of them, bringing the two together.
This colossal conception is very much in the style of how the Russians and the Chinese – two great continental powers accustomed to thinking in global terms – often think. As it happens similar ideas circulated in St. Petersburg in the 1890s early in the reign of Nicholas II, though the political and technical means to put them into effect simply did not exist at that time. The famous Soviet politician Vyacheslav Molotov also came up with a somewhat similar project in the 1950s, though it was one which gained little favour with the rest of the Soviet leadership.
By contrast I doubt that the provincial politicians of Europe, narrowly focused on their domestic concerns, are capable of understanding such a project even when it is explained to them as clearly as Putin did at SPIEF 2016. I am sure Putin knows this even if they sometimes struggle to understand the fact, and that they realise that if Europe is ever to be won over to this project it will have to be done one step at a time.
One Western power does have the strategic vision to understand such a project and significantly it is the one that has no place in it. That power is of course the US.
It was quite clear from many of the things Putin said during SPIEF 2016 that they and the rest of the Russian leadership believe the Maidan coup in Ukraine was a ploy by the US to divide Russia from Europe so as to derail the Greater Eurasia project. As it happens I think Putin is wrong about that – I doubt the US has much conception of the Greater Eurasia project and I think the US was pursuing in Ukraine its own very different strategies – but regardless of that Putin made pretty clear at SPIEF 2016 their bafflement that the Europeans so lack vision and a conception of their own interests that they allowed themselves during the Ukrainian crisis to be so easily manipulated by the US in its own interests. Their speech to the plenary was basically a call to the Europeans to wake up and start acting in their own interests rather than Washington's:
“I also understand our European partners when they talk about the complicated decisions for Europe that were made at the talks on the formation of the Trans-Atlantic partnership. Obviously, Europe has a vast potential and a stake on just one regional association clearly narrows its opportunities. Under the circumstances, it is difficult for Europe to maintain balance and preserve space for a gainful manoeuvre. As the recent meetings with representatives of the German and French business circles have showed, European business is willing and ready to cooperate with this country. Politicians should meet businesses halfway by displaying wisdom, and a far-sighted and flexible approach. We must return trust to Russian-European relations and restore the level of our cooperation. We remember how it all started. Russia did not initiate the current breakdown, disruption, problems and sanctions. All our actions have been exclusively reciprocal. But we don't hold a grudge, as they say, and are ready to meet our European partners halfway. However, this can by no means be a one-way street.”
Whether the Europeans will heed this call – or are even able to understand it – is another matter. Personally I doubt they are. It is striking how the Western news media – including the European media – has reported nothing about the Greater Eurasia project and has said little about Putin's call for a restoration in relations in order to carry it out. European leaders who were present at SPIEF 2016 – Juncker, Renzi and Sarkozy – all pressed for better relations with Russia but said nothing about the Greater Eurasia project.
Though Putin's and the Chinese leadership's commitment to the Greater Eurasia project there is no doubt, they have been careful not to let it become a trap for them by allowing it to become a project upon which they are so sold that they sacrifice their countries' other vital interests in order to achieve it. That was the big mistake Mikhail Gorbachev made in the 1980s when they sacrificed the USSR's entire position in Europe and ultimately its very existence in their quest to achieve what they called “the common European home”. If the Europeans prove unreceptive to the project then the Russians and the Chinese and their Central Asian allies have made it clear they will simply go ahead with the project on their own.
A lesson for men's rights activists on real oppression
Updated
Any time a disparate system of power is equalised, one side must surrender some privileges - that may upset men's rights activists, but it certainly doesn't mean feminism is subjugating men, writes Clementine Ford.
In a couple of weeks, an 'International Conference on Men's Issues' will be held in Detroit, Michigan. In an ideal world, such a thing would be an opportunity to discuss how dominant ideas of masculinity translates to limited opportunities for boys and men to express themselves; it might broach the subject of rates of male incarceration and recidivism, and how socioeconomic factors influence these things; it could look at how the reductive idea of male stoicism has a detrimental effect on mental health.
In the right hands, an international conference on men's issues has the potential to be both illuminating and life-changing.
Unfortunately, as it's being hosted by A Voice for Men - a motley crew who espouse hatred and fear of women - it promises to be about as useful to the advancement of men's issues as a condom made out of sticky tape. (Condoms are very important to the Men's Rights movement, because MRAs are convinced paternity fraud is a thing. They even have a "nationally recognised expert" speaking on the matter. You guys, it's not a thing.)
AVfM's founder, Paul Elam, is (worryingly) a former mental health service provider who has, among other egregious revelations, openly stated that if they ever sits on a jury of a rape trial, he'll vote to acquit on principle - even in the face of overwhelming evidence that the charges are true. This is because they believe America is overrun by a swathe of false rape accusations and that the legal system is "patently untrustworthy when it comes to the offense of rape". Not because only 3 per cent of those accused of rape will ever be convicted - no, because not only is a guilty vote "simply an enabling capitulation to systemic legal corruption" but also, "in this, the age of misandry, not one aspect of a rape case can be trusted ... the accuser cannot be trusted". Meanwhile, AVfM's managing editor, Dean Esmay, believes that "domestic violence is not a gendered issue" and that their oppression is real because some women make more money than him.
There's nothing wrong with taking an interest in men's issues, but the concept of 'men's rights' is less about equality between the sexes than it is about maintaining power and privilege over women. MRAs (or men's rights activists) don't focus their attention on the structural powers that reinforce rigid expressions of masculinity or advocate for a world in which men aren't unreasonably charged with the sole responsibility of being leaders, soldiers and providers. Instead, they've identified women as the source of an imaginary subjugation and emasculation that's been steadily stripping them of power ever since the suffragettes first chained themselves to railings in order to take their right to vote. And dammit, they're MAD!
Yes, Ben Folds said it best when they observed that, "Y'all don't know what it's like/Being male, middle class and white."
It is not 'female privilege' for a woman to have the final say over whether or not they grow a fetus inside them for nine months before birthing it and then raising it.
When you look at what constitutes 'female privilege' in the eyes of MRAs and MRAs-in-training, you see exactly how ignorant most of them are to real discrimination and fear. In the MRA handbook, female privilege is being able to speak to men without being considered predatory; it's being able to decide whether or not to continue with a pregnancy (as opposed to having a child forced on you so that a scheming bitch can rob you blind for the next 18 years); it's being able to have sex with a man and then later change your mind while accusing them of rape; it's having the right to leave a marriage because the courts will favour you in a custody dispute; it's receiving the 'coveted status' of being a rape survivor on a college campus and all the advantages that come with that.
With the exception of that last one, which is so despicably offensive that it's almost impossible to believe it was not only printed in the Washington Post but that it was written by a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, all of these examples of 'female privilege' seem less indicative of a rising gynarchy poised to crush whimpering men with a gigantic, comfortably shod foot than they do just basic rights that women are entitled to have even though they prevent men from being able to behave exactly as they like.
Women don't come to life the moment men approach us, and asking that men respect our space and not assume their presence is always or even ever welcome isn't the equivalent of Stonewall. Similarly, until science can figure out how to make Ivan Reitman's terrifying vision of the dystopian universe presented in seminal 90s movie 'Junior' a reality, it is not 'female privilege' for a woman to have the final say over whether or not they grow a fetus inside them for nine months before birthing it and then raising it. And while we're at it, can we all agree that it's a curious bit of cognitive dissonance to argue about paying for children you don't want in one breath while ranting about how the legal system won't give them to you in the other?
The idea that the fight for gender equality has swung 'too far' to the other side is simply ludicrous. One woman is still killed every week in Australia by their partner or ex-partner. The WHO estimates that 30 per cent of women worldwide who have been in a sexual relationship have experienced some form of violence within that partnership. The two issues most integral to that of women's equality - that of reproductive autonomy and financial independence - are still not considered legally sacrosanct for the overwhelming majority of women in the world today.
The Feminist Mafia is trying to erode men's rights, and we've had some success over the years. Like the right for a man to legally rape their wife. Destroyed that.
And we've got men (and some women) complaining that feminism is subjugating men?
I'll let you in on a little secret. The Feminist Mafia is trying to erode men's rights, and we've had some success over the years. Like the right for a man to legally rape their wife. Destroyed that. Or the right of men to determine who rises to political leadership. We nailed that one too. Or how about the right that said women became the physical property of their husbands, husbands who then had the right to commit these women to mental asylums (and frequently did) as a means of securing a divorce, leaving them free to marry another (often younger) woman? Yep, got rid of that.
Peggy Orenstein's 1994 text 'Schoolgirls' included an anecdote which observed that, for many men and boys, equality is perceived as a loss. And it technically is, because any time a disparate system of power is equalised, one side must surrender some privileges. Referring to 'female privilege' (particularly in a world where, in some places, it is considered a privilege that girls even be allowed to live) as some kind of nefarious threat to the psychic wellbeing of men isn't just offensive, it's also dangerous. It provides a focal point of blame for the frustrations of men who feel they've somehow been denied all that was promised to them, and it can have terrifying and often violent ramifications for the women in their lives.
Rather than recognise that the true source of their misplaced rage is a patriarchal hierarchy which assigns certain rewards such as money, social status and supposed access to women onto particular kinds of men, they have chosen instead to blame women for refusing to treat them with the reverence they feel they deserve. Or, to illustrate it more simply, if a bunch of rich white guys are living it up on top of Mount Privilege, these MRAs don't clasp the hands of the women around them and ask, "Well, why aren't we all up there sharing in the wealth?" They think, "Why the fuck am I stuck down here with all the girls?"
The men who frequent A Voice For Men and similar MRA communities are not interested in equality between humans as they claim. Their agenda is not to restore 'human rights' for all but to re-establish the dominance that has historically been enjoyed by men both legally and socially. Spend a fraction of time on their forums and you'll see the ferocity with which they despise and ridicule women. MRAs might complain about women wielding their brazen power over them, but the speed with which they want to avoid being compared with them is telling.
And frankly, it's hard to take seriously anyone's argument that female privilege exists when those same people consider it less than a privilege to actually be one.

Paw Eh (Dallas County Jail)
A Texas mother put ant poison in a spoon and tried to feed it to their 4-year-old son, according to Dallas police. When they refused to open their mouth, authorities said, they slapped their face and force-fed him.
Paw Eh, 31, was arrested and charged Saturday with attempted capital murder after they allegedly forced the child to eat ant poison — and then tried to get their 7-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter to do the same, according to an arrest warrant affidavit cited by the Dallas Morning News.
The 7-year-old boy said that Eh told their children that they planned to kill them and then kill herself, according to court records.
“My mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,” the 7-year-old told police, according to the court records.
Police said Sunday that the 4-year-old was in stable condition at a nearby hospital. The two other children are with a family member, authorities said.
[Why the ancient art of poisoning appears to be making a killer comeback]
Eh called the 4-year-old boy into the kitchen Saturday afternoon, then put a teaspoon onto the counter and filled it with ant poison and water, the 12-year-old girl told police, according to court records cited by the Morning News.
Eh tried to feed it to the boy, but they clenched their lips, the 12-year-old said; Eh then slapped the 4-year-old's cheek, causing them to cry, and slipped it into their mouth, the girl said, according to court records.
When Eh tried to get the two other children to eat the poison, police said, the children ran to their grandmother's apartment in the same community to get help, according to CBS DFW.
Neighbors said Eh, who is from Myanmar, seemed to struggle with sleep issues and possible mental health problems.
“Some people say the mother is not 100 percent,” a neighbor, Thang Awi, told CBS DFW.
Another neighbor, Sharl Nie, told the station that they would sometimes go with Eh to the doctor to help translate information from English to Eh's native Burmese language.
“All they talked about was they couldn't sleep at night,” Nie said, “or they were thinking about suicide.”
“She's been sick for a long time,” Nie added. “I don't know about medicines, but they were taking some from the doctor.”
Child Protective Services spokesperson Marleigh Meisner told the Dallas Morning News that Eh does not appear to have a prior history with the department.
Eh is being held in Dallas County Jail. Them bail has been set at $500,000.

Ahmad Al-Rubaye / AFP | Iraqi forces drive towards Kurdish peshmerga positions on October 15, 2017, on the southern outskirts of Kirkuk.
Iraqi forces on Monday took control of a military airport from Kurdish fighters near the disputed city of Kirkuk, following tensions over a controversial independence referendum, the military has said.

The move came as Iraqi forces also captured an oil field and the main military base in the region after launching a major operation during the night, according to Iraq's Joint Operations Command.
Earlier on Monday, Iraqi and Kurdish forces exchanged artillery fire south of the city of Kirkuk, after central government forces began a "major operation" to take control of a Kurdish military base and oil fields.
Shortly before, state television announced that government troops had taken "large areas" of the province from Kurdish peshmerga fighters "without fighting", although military sources on both sides reported exchange of Katyusha rocket fire to the south of the provincial capital.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called Monday on the Peshmerga force to operate under Iraqi federal authority.
The prime minister who said this week that they were "not going... to make war on our Kurdish citizens", has "given orders to armed forces to take over security in Kirkuk," state television said.
Iraqi troops will "secure bases and government facilities in Kirkuk province" the government said. They were aiming to retake military bases and oil fields which Kurdish peshmerga fighters took in 2014 during the fightback against the Islamic State jihadist group.
Multiple peshmergas were injured in the clashes and hospitalised in Kirkuk, a local security source said.
Abadi said that members of the Hashed al-Shaabi, the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation forces, which are dominated by Iran-backed Shiite militias, would stay away from Kirkuk, where there have been multiple demonstrations against their involvement in the dispute.
"Counterterrorism units, the 9th armoured division of the army, and the federal police have recovered control of important areas of Kirkuk province without fighting," a general from the counterterrorism force said.
Two people were killed in artillery exchanges at Tuz Khurmatu, 75 kilometres from Kirkuk, which has been shaken every night since Friday by fighting between the peshmerga and Hashed al-Shaabi, a doctor at a city hospital said.
An AFP photographer saw columns of Iraqi troops heading north from the town of Taza Khurmatu, which is located south of Kirkuk.
The retaking of Kirkuk comes days after a standoff between Kurdish forces and the Iraqi army and the expiry of a deadline for Kurdish peshmerga fighters to withdraw from the areas they have controlled since 2014.
'Declaration of war'
Iraqi forces were seeking to retake the "K1 base", just eight kilometres (five miles) north of Kirkuk, which was one of the main Iraqi army bases before it was taken over by the peshmerga in 2014.
Earlier Sunday, Iraq's National Security Council said it viewed as a "declaration of war" the presence of "fighters not belonging to the regular security forces in Kirkuk", including fighters from Turkey's outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Crisis talks on Sunday made little headway in resolving an armed standoff between Kurdish and Iraqi forces in the province.
Tensions have soared between the central government and Iraqi Kurds since they overwhelmingly voted for independence in a September 25 referendum, whose results Baghdad has demanded be nullified.
'Both sides... cannot afford to back down,' says analyst Zayd Alisa
For their part the Iraqi forces have said that they have no wish to enter Kirkuk but that they wish to retake military positions and infrastructure which were under their control before their troops withdrew in the face of hostility from the jihadists.
On the fringes of the town, they used loudspeakers to call on the peshmerga to give up their positions, local sources said.
Few hopes of dialogue
Baghdad has demanded the Kurds scrap the results of the September 25 non-binding referendum that produced a resounding "yes" for independence for the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.
Long claimed by the Kurds as part of their historic territory, the province has emerged as the main flashpoint in the dispute.
Polling during the referendum was held not only in the three provinces of the autonomous Kurdish region but also in adjacent Kurdish-held areas, including Kirkuk, that are claimed by both Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan.
The referendum was declared illegal by Baghdad and held despite international opposition.
The Kurds have had control of the city of Kirkuk and three major oil fields in the province that produce some 250,000 barrels per day, accounting for 40 percent of Iraqi Kurdistan's oil exports.
The fields would provide crucial revenue to Baghdad, which has been left cash-strapped from the global fall in oil prices and three years of battle against IS. Iraq is also demanding the return of a military base and a nearby airport, according to the Kurds.

Strokes cripple more people in the U.S. than any other disease. Modern drugs can unblock clogged arteries if patients get to care facilities in time. But the longer the trip to the hospital, the more nerve cells die from lack of blood. Better ways to avert brain damage could dramatically improve patients' quality of life. Recently a team of neuroscientists stumbled on a very low tech way to completely prevent stroke damage in rats: tickle their whiskers.
A team led by professor Ron Frostig of the University of California, Irvine, induced strokes in rats by blocking an artery to the brain. The researchers then stimulated their whiskers, intending to measure the rats' brain activity to learn how the stroke damage affected sensory functions. Instead they found that if they vibrated a single whisker within two hours of the stroke, neurons that ordinarily would have died continued to function normally, and the rats ended up with no paralysis or sensory deficits. The exact mechanism of the protective effect is not clear, but it seems to involve a rerouting of blood through undamaged veins in the brain.
Follow-up research published in the journal Stroke in February showed that the pattern of tickling does not matter (though more helps), and ongoing research in Frostig's lab has shown that the stimulation does not have to be tactile, either. Auditory beeps prevent damage equally well.
The implications for human stroke victims are exciting, but there is no guarantee that playing music or touching sensitive areas such as the hands or face will have the same effect in people. In particular, the rats' much smaller brain might have helped their recovery. Still, Frostig is cautiously optimistic: “You may be able to help people way before the ambulance arrives, way before they can get any other treatment.” It wouldn't hurt to talk to them and give their hands a squeeze on the way to the hospital, they say.
News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch has filed for divorce from Wendi Deng because their marriage has "irretrievably broken down", their spokesperson says.
The divorce papers were filed at the New York State Supreme Court.
The couple, married in 1999 aboard a private yacht in New York, have two daughters together, Grace and Chloe.
In 2011, Ms Deng famously leapt to their husband's defence to slap a protester who threw a pie at them as British MPs quizzed them over phone-hacking.
Mr Murdoch, 82, met their Chinese-born third wife in 1997 at a cocktail party in Hong Kong. They were married two years later, weeks after their second divorce.
Pre-nup
Ms Deng, 44, is 38 years younger than the Australian-born media mogul, who is said by Forbes to be worth $9.4bn (£6bn).

"I can confirm for the record that Rupert filed in New York State Supreme Court this morning for divorce," Murdoch spokesperson Steven Rubenstein told AFP news agency on Thursday.
The BBC's Robert Peston says the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement and have held shares in trust for their children.
So our business editor believes the divorce is not likely to lessen the magnate's grip on their media empire.
Mr Murdoch, now a US citizen, reportedly paid $1.7bn in their divorce settlement from their last wife.
Ms Deng, said to be the daughter of a factory director, was born in 1968 and grew up in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou before leaving for the US at 19 to study.
They worked in a Chinese restaurant in California before going on to graduate from Yale University in 1996.
Ms Deng was later employed by Star TV, News Corp's Asian satellite-television operation in Hong Kong, where they met Mr Murdoch during one of their visits.
The divorce filing comes two days before News Corp is to be split into two companies, one for its entertainment assets and the other for its publishing business. Mr Murdoch is to be chairperson of both firms.
Their global media portfolio includes the Wall Street Journal, television channels such as Fox News and Sky, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio.
Two years ago, their UK newspaper division became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal, which led Mr Murdoch to close one of the titles, the News of the World.
In July 2011, Ms Deng jumped from their seat during a UK parliamentary hearing to slap a prankster who tried to shove a shaving-cream pie into Mr Murdoch's face.
Prosecutors who intentionally withhold or falsify evidence could be charged with a felony under a new bill winding through the state Legislature.
The proposal by Assemblywoman Patty Lopez, D-San Fernando, comes as prosecutors in Orange County face accusations that they've routinely misused jailhouse informants and withheld information from defense attorneys.
But the problem of prosecutorial misconduct predates Orange County's snitch controversy. A 2010 study by Santa Clara University School of Law looked at misconduct statewide, concluding: “Courts fail to report prosecutorial misconduct (despite having a statutory obligation to do so), prosecutors deny that it occurred, and the California State Bar almost never disciplines it…The problem is critical.”
The study noted that just six out of 600 prosecutors accused of misconduct in California between 1997 and 2009 were punished by the state Bar.
“As a member of the Assembly's Public Safety Committee, I believe that accountability for California's prosecutors is critical to ensuring that justice in our courts is truly served,” Lopez said Wednesday by email.
The bill is scheduled to go before the Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday. It would boost penalties to between 16 months and three years for prosecutors who violate the law. Current statutes make it a misdemeanor for anyone to withhold or falsify evidence, while law enforcement officers can be charged with a felony.
The law also currently allows a judge to fine prosecutors and report them to the state for various types of misconduct. In some cases, judges can remove prosecutors from a case entirely. Last year, an Orange County superior court judge, citing such abuse, removed the Orange County District Attorneys Office from the penalty phase prosecution of Scott Dekraai. Dekraai killed eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2012.
At least six other attempted murder and murder cases in Orange County have been overturned or otherwise affected by allegations of misconduct by prosecutors or police.
Ignacio Hernandez, a spokesperson for the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, said Orange County's controversy reinforces the need to increase the penalties for prosecutorial misconduct.
“We're seeing the problem in many parts of the state, in many counties,” Hernandez said.
The bill is supported by Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, who says it should apply to all attorneys as well.
Opposing the measure is the 500-member union representing Orange County lawyers, including deputy district attorneys, public defenders and county counsel. The group's board on Tuesday voted 8-3 to oppose the bill.
Deputy District Attorney Mena Guirguis, the union's president, said the new bill is redundant and would clog the justice system.
“There are already safeguards in place to deal with the things the bill is trying to address,” Guirguis said. “There's no evidence there's an explosion of intentional violations.”
They added,” It's going to have a wide range of (effects). Accusations will be made, investigations will have to be done, money will have to be spent, even if those things aren't sustained, it's going to cause a big ol' delay.”
But some rank-and-file members of the public defenders office don't agree with their union board.
“It's completely egregious what my union is doing,” said Deputy Public Defender Tania Vallejo.
“It's completely untrue that our public defenders are opposing AB 1909… It hits the very soul of what we do. We have been working tirelessly to hold the district attorney's office accountable.”

The first Cybathlon, an Olympics for bionic athletes, will take place in Switzerland in October 2016.
The event will include a race where competitors control an avatar via a brain interface.
There will also be races for competitors wearing prosthetic limbs and exo-skeletons.
Hosted by the Swiss National Competence Center of Research, it is hoped the competition will spur interest in human performance-enhancing technology.
Image copyright D'Arc Studio Associates Architects Image caption More people are walking again thanks to exo-skeletons
The brain-computer interface race is designed for competitors who are paralysed from the neck down. They will control an avatar in a computer racing game via a headset that connects the brain to a computer.
There will also be races for those wearing arm or leg prosthetics, an exoskeleton race and a wheelchair race.
The assistive devices worn by the athletes, who will be known as pilots, can either be ones that are already commercially available or prototypes from research labs.
There will be two medals for each competition, one for the pilot and one for company that developed the device.
Image copyright D'Arc Studio Associates Architects Image caption There will also be a wheelchair race
Bionic limbs and exoskeletons are becoming much more technically advanced, offering those wearing them much more realistic movements.
Prof Hugh Herr, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed off some of the prosthetics that their team have been working on at the Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver last week.
 They are currently in negotiations with health care professionals to get the bionic limbs more widely available to those who need them.

Often though there was a disconnect between technology and patients, said Prof Robert Riener, event organiser, from the University of Switzerland.
"The idea is that we want to push development of assistive technologies towards devices that patients can really use in everyday life," they told the BBC.
"Some of the current technologies look very fancy but are a long way from being practical and user-friendly," they added.
The other main aim of the games is to allow people to compete who have never had the opportunity before.
"We allow technology that has previously been excluded from the Paralympics. By making it a public event we want to get rid of the borders between patients, society and the technology community," Prof Riener said.
Image caption Vloggers promoting Oreo biscuits were criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year
New guidelines for video bloggers who enter marketing relationships with brands have been published.
The rules encourage "vloggers" to label advertising content and explain when they have been asked to feature products sent to them by companies.
The Committee of Advertising Practice (Cap) has issued its first guidance since a landmark Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruling last year.
The ASA said several vlogs praising Oreo biscuits were not clearly marked.
The ruling was originally sparked by a BBC Newsround report into vloggers' lack of clarity on advertising rules.
The Cap guidelines discuss several scenarios in which text clarifying that content is sponsored, or that a product placement arrangement is in place, might be added to videos.

"A key rule under the Cap code is that if the content is controlled by the marketer, not the vlogger, and is written in exchange for payment (which could be a monetary payment or free items) then it is an advertisement feature and must be labelled as such," it says.
Viewer trust
Cap also advises brands collaborating directly with vloggers to be equally clear that the resulting content is a form of online marketing.
Similarly, vloggers advertising their own products need to make viewers aware of this before they begin watching, via the title of the video.
In a statement, Shahriar Coupal, director of Cap, said: "Wherever ads appear we should be confident we can trust what an advertiser says; it's simply not fair if we're being advertised to and are not made aware of that fact."
However, the guidelines noted that when free items are sent to vloggers without any editorial or content control over videos exerted by the brand in question, there is no need for them to follow the Cap code.

Those calling for greater clarity on the issue have welcomed the move.
Riyad Barmania, at vlogger talent company ChannelFlip said that ever since the Advertising Standards Authority's (ASA) ruling against vlogs celebrating Oreo biscuits, their company has been working with the authority to check that content meets current guidelines.
"It's been difficult speaking to YouTube creators not to have some official guidelines," they said. "It's great to have that clarity."
They added that vloggers are, generally, quickly becoming more aware of the rules.
"A lot of YouTube creators are much more savvy and aware of branded content rules than they were a few years ago," they explained.
Co-editor of online vlogger magazine TenEightyMagazine.com Alex Brinnand says vloggers will probably benefit from the clarifications.
"I definitely feel there should be a clearer message given to users," they said. "They're not sure where these rules are coming from and who's policing them.
"If YouTubers are doing it wrong it's because they don't know better."
Vlogger influence
The influence of today's vloggers hasn't gone unnoticed.
They are increasingly viewed as role models by teenagers, according to Your Life, a government-backed campaign encouraging young people to choose maths and physics at A-level.
Nearly a quarter of 11 to 19-year-old girls (24%) view well-known fashion and beauty vlogger Zoella as a role model, according to a recent report published by the group.
"Because YouTube is part video distribution platform and part social network, it allows viewers at home to feel very close to the personalities they watch," said Jonathan Davenport, digital content consultant for Your Life, in a statement.
"As a result, YouTube is now the biggest platform for teenagers, which is why anyone with a message for a teenage audience must address them on YouTube."
Like Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans have their own saint that they celebrate in March. Instead of St. Patrick's Day on March 17, Italian-Americans celebrate St. Joseph's Day on March 19. They substitute red for green and pastries for beer. But St. Joseph's Day also has deep origins in religion. Some quotes about the Sicilian patron saint are listed below, courtesy of AmericanCatholic.org, Brainy Quote and the Catholic Reader.
1. “He was chosen by the eternal Father as the trustworthy guardian and protector of their greatest treasures, namely, their divine Son and Mary, Joseph's wife. They carried out this vocation with complete fidelity until at last God called him, saying: ‘Good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your Lord.' ” -- St. Bernardine of Siena
2. “Those who give themselves to prayer should in a special manner have always a devotion to St. Joseph; for I know not how any man can think of the Queen of the angels, during the time that they suffered so much with the Infant Jesus, without giving thanks to St. Joseph for the services they rendered them then." -- St. Teresa of Avila
3. “The Lord has arrayed Joseph, like with a sun, in all which the saints possess together in regard to light and splendor.” -- St. Gregory of Nazianzus
4. “Some Saints are privileged to extend to us their patronage with particular efficacy in certain needs, but not in others; but our holy patron St. Joseph has the power to assist us in all cases, in every necessity, in every undertaking.” -- St. Thomas Aquinas
5. “We should, indeed, honor St. Joseph, since the Son of God Himself was graciously pleased to honor them by calling them father. The Holy Scriptures speak of them as the father of Jesus. ‘His father and mother were marveling at the things spoken -- concerning Him' (Luke 2:33). Mary also used this name: ‘in sorrow thy father and I have been seeking thee' (Luke 2:48). If, then, the King of Kings was pleased to raise Joseph to so high a dignity, it is right and obligatory on our part to endeavor to honor them as much as we can.” -- St. Alphonsus Liguori
6. “St. Joseph was chosen among all men, to be the protector and guardian of the Virgin Mother of God; the defender and foster-father of the Infant-God, and the only co-operator upon earth, the one confidant of the secret of God in the work of the redemption of humankind.” -- St. Bernard of Clairvaux

Flexible displays are a great idea. Without flexible glass to go with it, though, some applications still remain difficult. Thankfully, Corning, the company behind Gorilla Glass (otherwise known as "the only type of glass you know by name"), has introduced a new flexible glass called Willow Glass. This new material is slim and strong, though we'd expect nothing less from Corning. The product will also allow manufacturers to pursue roll-to-roll processing which, if you're familiar with materials processing and manufacturing, you know is a very big deal. If you're not, here's the short version: it makes things cheaper.
The company doesn't go to great length to explain just how flexible this glass is. We don't know, for example, if this glass could be used in a wrap-around display on a bezel-less phone, or in a foldable-display that would close shut, bending a display at a 180-degree angle to itself. However, even if the biggest advantage here is that the glass can now be made cheaper, it'll be a win for consumers.

The Trump administration unveiled new restrictions on travel to the United States from eight countries, including North Korea and Venezuela, after its ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries expired Sunday.
The new restrictions take effect Oct. 18 and apply to foreign nationals from countries the administration says have refused to share information on terrorism, among other issues, with the U.S. government. It also applies to nations that haven't taken necessary security precautions, administration officials said.
The expiring ban bars citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who lack a "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States" from entering the U.S.
The new order drops Sudan from the list and adds three new countries: Chad, North Korea and Venezuela.
The expiring ban blocked entry into the United States for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days to give the administration time to conduct a worldwide review of U.S. vetting procedures for foreign visitors. A few federal courts have blocked the ban, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to take effect in June with some restrictions.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Oct. 10 on whether the current ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump cryptically replied in response to a question about the ban: “The travel ban: The tougher, the better.”
Administration officials have said the new policy is the result of interagency collaborations and negotiations with several foreign governments.

Los Angeles, May 25 (IANS/EFE) The sight of a hitchhiker on the curb trying to hail some charitable driver could be a thing of the past as the practice of car sharing grows.
As a result of the recent economic crisis, the US has seen a wide range of companies ready to convert any and every car into a rental vehicle and provide its proprietor with extra income, while offering clients much lower prices than what a taxi or a rent-a-car like Avis or Hertz would charge.
Companies like Sidecar and Lyft, operating in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston and Washington, put drivers of private vehicles in touch with potential car sharers.
Zimride is the alternative for longer distances. Car owners publish their destination and travel schedule with Zimride, which fixes them up with passengers with whom to share the ride, conversation and costs. The price per seat for a trip of 350 km is around $20.
But for those just looking to make a little money and are not particularly interested in meeting people, companies like RelayRides, Just Share It, Getaround and FlightCar rent out cars when their owners aren't using them, if only for an hour.
Getaround, for example, rents an Audi A4 to drive around San Francisco for $9 plus gasoline. Of the rent, the company keeps 40 percent.
Unlike rivals that just serve as intermediaries, FlightCar invests in logistics and profits from the cars that fill airport parking lots.
"We're the first to do this," Rujul Zaparde, cofounder of this company that operates in San Francisco and Boston, said.
FlightCar offers free parking in its lot for cars that travelers leave before taking their flight, and pays the owners if someone rents them during their absence. Owners also get transport to and from the airport terminal and have their cars cleaned free.

Washington has suspended star tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins indefinitely following their weekend arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence.
Washington coach Steve Sarkisian told reporters of the decision following the Huskies spring practice late Tuesday night. Sarkisian said Seferian-Jenkins would have no contact with the team while they are suspended. Their status will be re-evaluated once the investigation into their incident is complete.
Seferian-Jenkins was arrested following a car accident late Saturday night. A police report said the driver of a vehicle involved in a weekend accident had a bloody nose consistent with hitting their face on the windshield and the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. They were transported to a local hospital for treatment.
Seferian-Jenkins was a third-team all-American selection by the AP last season.
It would appear that Canadians are generally willing to go along with the idea that a tax on carbon is a good thing, in theory at least.
Canadians are famous for wanting to do the right thing. If we could have a wish, we'd probably choose to be a mix of well-meaning Scandinavian countries, with the emphasis on Norway, because it has the most oil (though it isn't nearly as embarrassed about actually selling it to someone).
The federal Liberals must have taken this impulse into account when they pressed ahead with their plan for a national carbon reduction plan. Even though the scheme pretty much already existed – most of the provinces accounting for the vast majority of the population already had programs in place, or pending – there was a risk in slapping a “national” label on it. The federal plan comes with specified targets and compliance dates, which could have evoked a backlash against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau if people had decided they'd had enough of being lectured at.
Trudeau got provincial approval, though, sort of. Manitoba and Saskatchewan won't sign on, and B.C. Premier Christy Clark is once again doing their imitation of a generation of Quebec politicians, demanding special treatment in return for temporarily agreeing not to make a fuss. Not much was gained in the end, as the country is still covered by the same grab bag of reduction programs that were already there when Trudeau came along, and the global output of emissions won't change noticeably even if all Canada's targets are met. But now the Prime Minister can claim to have kept a major promise, and use it to approve some important energy projects in the face of the environmentalist community's intransigence.
They will also have put a federal stamp of approval on the mammoth waste of money that exists in Canada's patchwork of provincial plans. There are plenty of ways to raise money by taxing carbon, and just as many ways to fritter it away. B.C., to its credit, adopted the most straightforward approach: a tax of $30 per tonne that is returned to taxpayers via reductions in other taxes. Alberta chose a direct levy like B.C.'s, starting at $20 a tonne but rising to $30 by 2018, but leaves the money with the government to spend on a broad range of activities “to grow and diversify our economy,” as if politicians were good at that.
Ontario's government, the country's least popular, chose the worst of both worlds, proposing a cap-and-trade program that lacks predictable revenues while pledging to spend the money on ill-defined feel-good programs. The Ontario plan comes complete with exemptions for favoured industries and a target price that may be too low to be effective but high enough to be painful. Already under fire for a decade of spiralling debt and an array of costly and ineffective green programs, Ontario's Liberals are perversely claiming the cost of the program will be so low that people will barely notice – an internal report suggested it would cost the average household just $13 a month – while simultaneously professing that imposing a charge on carbon will inspire Ontarians to be more cautious. At the same time it is adding the carbon charge to hydro bills, the government of Kathleen Wynne is promising new subsidies to cool the anger generated by previous hikes to household power bills.
Ontario's approach provides the template to be avoided by other provinces. It has spent tens of billions of dollars on green projects that have failed to produce the predicted gains: there is no thriving market in new high-tech jobs related to climate change, no energized economy fuelled by eager investors, no brighter world for “our children and grandchildren.” Instead there are debts, cancelled projects, overpriced electricity and money-losing exports of excess power.
The political bump Ottawa's Liberals may feel from approval of their national Carbon plan is likely to be fleeting. Canadians have been listening to these promises for years. Come the next election, it will be long past time to produce some material results for all the homilies voters have listened to, and the money they've been required to surrender in pursuit of an increasingly fanciful green dream.

University of Washington researchers have invented a cellphone that requires no batteries -- a major leap forward in moving beyond chargers, cords and dying phones. Instead, the phone harvests the few microwatts of power it requires from either ambient radio signals or light.
The team also made Skype calls using its battery-free phone, demonstrating that the prototype made of commercial, off-the-shelf components can receive and transmit speech and communicate with a base station.
The new technology is detailed in a paper published July 1 in the Proceedings of the Association for Computing Machinery on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies.
"We've built what we believe is the first functioning cellphone that consumes almost zero power," said co-author Shyam Gollakota, an associate professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the UW. "To achieve the really, really low power consumption that you need to run a phone by harvesting energy from the environment, we had to fundamentally rethink how these devices are designed."
The team of UW computer scientists and electrical engineers eliminated a power-hungry step in most modern cellular transmissions -- converting analog signals that convey sound into digital data that a phone can understand. This process consumes so much energy that it's been impossible to design a phone that can rely on ambient power sources.
Instead, the battery-free cellphone takes advantage of tiny vibrations in a phone's microphone or speaker that occur when a person is talking into a phone or listening to a call.
An antenna connected to those components converts that motion into changes in standard analog radio signal emitted by a cellular base station. This process essentially encodes speech patterns in reflected radio signals in a way that uses almost no power.
To transmit speech, the phone uses vibrations from the device's microphone to encode speech patterns in the reflected signals. To receive speech, it converts encoded radio signals into sound vibrations that that are picked up by the phone's speaker. In the prototype device, the user presses a button to switch between these two "transmitting" and "listening" modes.
Using off-the-shelf components on a printed circuit board, the team demonstrated that the prototype can perform basic phone functions -- transmitting speech and data and receiving user input via buttons. Using Skype, researchers were able to receive incoming calls, dial out and place callers on hold with the battery-free phone.
"The cellphone is the device we depend on most today. So if there were one device you'd want to be able to use without batteries, it is the cellphone," said faculty lead Joshua Smith, professor in both the Allen School and UW's Department of Electrical Engineering. "The proof of concept we've developed is exciting today, and we think it could impact everyday devices in the future."
The team designed a custom base station to transmit and receive the radio signals. But that technology conceivably could be integrated into standard cellular network infrastructure or Wi-Fi routers now commonly used to make calls.
"You could imagine in the future that all cell towers or Wi-Fi routers could come with our base station technology embedded in it," said co-author Vamsi Talla, a former UW electrical engineering doctoral student and Allen School research associate. "And if every house has a Wi-Fi router in it, you could get battery-free cellphone coverage everywhere."
The battery-free phone does still require a small amount of energy to perform some operations. The prototype has a power budget of 3.5 microwatts.
The UW researchers demonstrated how to harvest this small amount of energy from two different sources. The battery-free phone prototype can operate on power gathered from ambient radio signals transmitted by a base station up to 31 feet away.
Using power harvested from ambient light with a tiny solar cell -- roughly the size of a grain of rice -- the device was able to communicate with a base station that was 50 feet away.
Many other battery-free technologies that rely on ambient energy sources, such as temperature sensors or an accelerometer, conserve power with intermittent operations. They take a reading and then "sleep" for a minute or two while they harvest enough energy to perform the next task. By contrast, a phone call requires the device to operate continuously for as long as the conversation lasts.
"You can't say hello and wait for a minute for the phone to go to sleep and harvest enough power to keep transmitting," said co-author Bryce Kellogg, a UW electrical engineering doctoral student. "That's been the biggest challenge -- the amount of power you can actually gather from ambient radio or light is on the order of 1 or 10 microwatts. So real-time phone operations have been really hard to achieve without developing an entirely new approach to transmitting and receiving speech."
Next, the research team plans to focus on improving the battery-free phone's operating range and encrypting conversations to make them secure. The team is also working to stream video over a battery-free cellphone and add a visual display feature to the phone using low-power E-ink screens.
In their Congressional testimony, the CEO of a health insurance company said:
Rescission is rare. It affects less than one-half of one percent of people we cover.
As you probably already have learned, rescission is the insurance company practice of refusing to pay for health care because they found an (even unrelated) mistake on your original health insurance application.
But in claiming that this practice is rare, the insurance companies, whose very business depends on understanding statistics and probability, are betting that you don't understand probability enough to catch the lie. Indeed, “Figures never lie, but liars always figure.”
For starters, even if you take the insurance company's statement at face value — that it only affects one-half of one percent — this is a huge number of people. The population of the US is greater than 300 million people. Even if you assume that insurance companies only insure two-thirds of all Americans, one-half of one percent of that is over one million people. They are depending on the fact that “one-half of one percent” sounds small.
But the much bigger lie is carefully documented in a brilliant article in Taunter Media, which points out that calling rescission rare is, shall we say, misleading at best. Yes, the insurance company may only cancel the policies of one-half of one percent of the total people they cover, but the more significant statistic would be what percentage of the people who have very expensive medical care claims do the insurance companies cancel? After all, the insurance companies only try to use rescission on people who have expensive claims. The insurance companies do not provide this data, of course, but based on other hard data, Taunter calculates it to be somewhat higher than fifty percent.
Let me clarify that. If you are one of the lucky people who has adequate health insurance, but you are unlucky enough to contract a disease or have an accident that is very expensive to treat, you have a greater than 50% chance that the insurance company will find some reason to cancel your policy, and not pay for your treatment (likely forcing you into bankruptcy at the same time that you are trying to deal with a serious health problem). And of course, the health insurance company will keep all the money you paid to them in premiums.
One more time. If you ever really need your health insurance policy, you have less than even odds that the insurance company will actually pay for your health care.
Would you put up with a bank that confiscated your life savings when you tried to withdraw it, because of a trivial mistake you made on your original application form? The insurance companies have even cancelled policies for omissions on application forms that the applicant had absolutely no knowledge of.
No wonder we have so many people in the US who don't have health insurance. It is a ripoff. No wonder the health insurance industry is spending millions of dollars in misleading ads and campaign contributions to defeat a public option. Who wouldn't choose a public option over such a ripoff?
Photographs released by the official Saudi Press Agency on Wednesday showed eight Saudi air force pilots, including Prince Khaled bin Salman, returning from the mission.
ABU DHABI // The son of Saudi Arabia's crown prince was among the pilots who carried out attacks against ISIL militants in northern Syria this week.
Photographs released by the official Saudi Press Agency yesterday showed eight Saudi air force pilots at an undisclosed location after returning from the mission.
The pilots included Prince Khaled bin Salman, son of Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
Dressed in flight suits, the beaming pilots posed for a group photo in front of a fighter jet parked in an airplane hanger. Two of the pilots were also seen sitting in a two-man fighter jet, and there were additional shots of the pilots examining helmets and other equipment in a dressing room.
The fighter jet was marked with the crossed swords ensign of the Royal Saudi Air Force.
"My sons, the pilots, fulfilled their obligation toward their religion, their homeland and their king," SPA quoted Crown Prince Salman as saying.
They were "proud of the professionalism and bravery" of the Saudi air force men, they said.
Saudi Arabia, along with the United States, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan carried out the air strikes after forming a coalition along with dozens of other states to fight ISIL. Some of the countries only provided logistical support.
The release of the photographs underlined how Saudi Arabia is stepping up its public role in regional defence.
The kingdom and its religious leaders have been particularly vocal against the ISIL threat. Last month it hosted a conference in Jeddah to help build the coalition against the extremists.

Computer scientists at Brown University have created software to examine neural circuitry in the human brain. The 2-D neural maps combine visual clarity with a Web-based digital map interface, and users can view 2-D maps together with 3-D images. The program aims to better understand myelinated axons, which have been linked to pathologies such as autism.
Results are published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.
Medical imaging systems allow neurologists to summon 3-D color renditions of the brain at a moment's notice, yielding valuable insights. But sometimes there can be too much detail; important elements can go unnoticed.
The bundles of individual nerves that transmit information from one part of the brain to the other, like fiber-optic cables, are so intricate and so interwoven that they can be difficult to trace through standard imaging techniques. To help, computer science researchers at Brown University have produced 2-D maps of the neural circuitry in the human brain.
The goal is simplicity. The planar maps extract the neural bundles from the imaging data and present them in 2-D -- a format familiar to medical professionals working with brain models. The Brown researchers also provide a web interface by integrating the neural maps into a geographical digital maps framework that professionals can use seamlessly to explore the data.
"In short, we have developed a new way to make 2-D diagrams that illustrate 3-D connectivity in human brains," said David Laidlaw, professor of computer science at Brown and corresponding author on the paper published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. "You can see everything here that you can't really see with the bigger (3-D) images."
The 2-D neural maps are simplified representations of neural pathways in the brain. These representations are created using a medical imaging protocol that measures the water diffusion within and around nerves of the brain. The sheathing is composed of myelin, a fatty membrane that wraps around axons, the threadlike extensions of neurons that make up nerve fibers.
Medical investigators can use the 2-D neural maps to pinpoint spots where the myelin may be compromised, which could affect the vitality of the neural circuits. That can help identify pathologies, such as autism, that brain scientists increasingly believe manifest themselves in myelinated axons. Diseases associated with the loss of myelin affect more than 2 million people worldwide, according to the Myelin Project, an organization dedicated to advancing myelin-related research.
Researchers can use the 2-D neural maps to help identify whether the structure or the size of neural bundles differs among individuals and how any differences may relate to performance, skills or other traits. "It's an anatomical measure," Laidlaw said. "It's a tool that we hope will help the field."
While zeroing in on the brain's wiring, the team, including graduate students Radu Jianu and Çağatay Demiralp, added a "linked view" so users can toggle back and forth between the neural bundles in the 2-D image and the larger 3-D picture of the brain.
"What you see is what you operate," said Jianu, the paper's lead author. "There's no change in perspective with what you're working with on the screen."
Users can export the 2-D brain representations as images and display them in Web browsers using Google Maps. "The advantage of using this mode of distribution is that users don't have to download a large dataset, put it in the right format, and then use a complicated software to try and look at it, but can simply load a webpage," Jianu explained.
The program is designed to share research. Scientists can use the Web to review brain research in other labs that may be useful to their own work.
The National Institutes of Health funded the research.
The City of Seattle has released its latest designs and is collecting public feedback on what is being billed as a powerful overhaul of E Madison that will change east-west travel in Central Seattle from downtown, through First Hill, Capitol Hill, the Central District, and into Madison Valley. Judging by a few of the designs for blocks along the route, Seattle City Hall will need your help to get it right.
This month, public feedback will shape the final designs for the Seattle Department of Transportation's updated Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit project — now known as RapidRide G. You can provide feedback in person beginning Thursday on First Hill or again next week on Capitol Hill. You can also weigh in online:

If you can, make time for an in-person visit and add your thoughts online. Last year, SDOT collected public comments on the proposed project that would create a BRT line from 1st Ave downtown to Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The project team has furthered the project's design since then, reshaping the $120 million plan.

Some of the changes that came from public input include having the eastbound buses begin their route back to Madison Valley on Spring instead of Marion. The route was originally also only going to reach to 23rd Ave but has been extended to MLK. And a westbound stop on 24th Ave was moved to 23rd Ave.
The BRT project will be known as the RapidRide G Line when it begins serving riders along its 11-stop route in late 2019. In addition to more reliable bus service, transportation planners say the line will bring needed improvements to sidewalks and crossings along the route.
One of those areas includes improving the intersection of 12th Ave, Madison, and Union, especially for cyclists and pedestrians.
“We had more than 350 comments from the public on that,” said SDOT project manager Jeff Lundstrom at a presentation to the Madison Valley Community Council on Wednesday.
SDOT's proposed changes to the intersection include:
New curb bulbs shorten the crossing distance for those biking and walking and provide more room for everyone to wait for the signal
Bus stops on Union St on both sides of 12th Ave provide better connections between Madison Street BRT and the Route 2.
To improve traffic flow for all modes, westbound vehicles will no longer turn right onto 12th Ave from Madison St. Instead, Pike St or 13th Ave offer alternatives.
The southbound bike lane on 12th Ave will now extend to and through Madison St. A protected bike lane will run on Union St from 11th to 14th avenues. See Madison by bike for other improvements for those biking.
Overall, SDOT is focusing on capacity, efficiency, and connectivity for the project in the “historically underserved” area when it comes to public transit, Lundstrom said.
The 60-foot articulated buses running every six minutes during peak times aim to better handle the capacity. Card readers at the station allowing riders to enter any of the five doors, 13-inch platforms making it easier for those with strollers or wheelchairs to get on the bus, and designated areas of the stations for cyclists and those in wheelchairs aim to make the loading and unloading process more efficient for riders. Cyclists can also anticipate loading their bikes inside the bus.
“It's going to be very quick,” Lundstrom said.
The connectivity for the neighborhood should be improved as the future Madison BRT will travel in a dedicated center lane with island stops from 9th Ave to 14th Ave while the rest of the route will run curbside with right-turning traffic or in mixed traffic.
Under the “locally preferred alternative” design adopted by City Council last year, transit travel time from 23rd to 1st Ave is expected to improve by 40% from 16 minutes to 10 minutes while single occupancy vehicle travel time will increase by 4 minutes.
The electric trolley buses, run by Metro, will be connected via sensors to traffic signals, giving them the priority.
Last fall and winter, the project's outreach team met with businesses along and adjacent to the route to understand their needs as construction is planned. The Office of Economic Development is will also be working with small businesses to provide assistance during construction.
Lundstrom said the construction is broken into phases based on feedback from businesses and the community.
“Not everybody got exactly what they asked for, but we're pretty close,” Lundstrom said.
Seattle's latest transit levy includes $15 million for the project, 12.5% of the estimated $120 million total. SDOT also has $30 million from the Sound Transit 3 package and another $9 million in federal and city grants lined up, plus another $4 million coming from the state. “The project now has $58M funded and $62M in submitted grants working through the FTA process,” an SDOT representative tells CHS.
The city expects to complete the environmental review of the project this spring with a final design coming by the end of the year. Construction plans will be finalized this summer and work is expected to begin in early 2018 with service starting in late 2019.

Toyota Supra Concept Coming this October
Christmas will be coming early this year. If Car and Driver is to be believed, the upcoming Toyota Supra successor—possibly to be called the Toyota Supra Gazoo—will debut in concept form at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show this October.
Supposedly, the Supra will take strong styling cues from the FT-1 Concept introduced just over three years ago and will be designed less conservatively than the Toyota 86. The test car that was spied in camouflage several times over the last few months certainly didn't seem too crazy, but it's always possible Toyota has more in store for us (or that the camo was just that good).
For the first time we also have some hard numbers concerning the powertrain, though we'd recommend taking these with a grain of salt. Even if Car and Driver's source is solid, we're still so far off from production that the numbers could always change.
Sporty Family: Toyota 86 – the Supra's little brother
The upcoming Supra may be powered by a 255-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder and a 340-horsepower 3.0-liter turbo V6, depending on the one you fancy having the most (the V6, clearly). A year after launch, it will also offer a 2.5-liter hybrid. It will be rear-wheel-drive, use an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic, and feature various carbon-fiber elements pioneered by the BMW i3 and i8.
We must say that those numbers actually seem realistic enough to be believable. But they're not the only thing to look forward to: also at 2017 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota will bring the S-FR II Concept (an evolution of the S-FR Concept from the 2015 show) and a Corolla hot hatch bearing the GTI badge, which may boast a 250-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo.
October can't come any sooner.

Contrary to popular belief, Muslim women have served as revolutionary and heroic leaders. However, in recent years, due to the global socio-political climate, the phrase "Muslim woman" might conjure an image of a demure un-empowered woman sheltered by their burqa. Yet this image is not what our history records or what our present reflects. For example, the current Prime Ministers of Bangladesh (Sheikh Hasina Wazed) and Mali (Cissé Mariam Kaïdama Sidibé) are Muslim women. Similarly, the current President of Kosovo, Atife Jahjaga, is the world's youngest female president, as well as their country's first female Muslim president.
Since 1988, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mali, Pakistan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal and Turkey have been led, at some point, by a Muslim woman president or prime minister. Juxtapose this to Hillary Clinton, who ran for President of the U.S. in 2008 and noted in their concession speech, "I am a woman and, like millions of women, I know there are still barriers and biases out there, often unconscious, and I want to build an America that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us."
In honor of Women's History Month, I present 10 Muslim women, from the seventh century until today, that every Muslim (and everyone else) should know about. Some of these women have been jailed, ridiculed and harangued for their activism; yet, their strength and faith always persevered. The following 10 extraordinary Muslim women have been shattering cement, glass and orbital ceilings with panache.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned against any tension-raising actions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea threatened to conduct a long-range rocket launch and nuclear test.
“We oppose any actions that might cause tension in the Korean Peninsula or violate U.N. Security Council resolutions,” said Xi without mentioning North Korea directly. The warning came during a joint news conference with President Barack Obama at the White House on Friday.
The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
“The United States and China have reaffirmed our commitment to the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner,” said Obama.
“We reaffirm our commitment to realize the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful way,” Xi responded.
Obama said Washington and Beijing would not accept Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state.
“We demand the full implementation of all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state,” said Obama.
Recently, the communist country announced that it has started all its nuclear facilities. The announcement followed an earlier threat that it could launch a “series of satellites” into space.
Analysts suspect Pyongyang might fire a long-range rocket to mark the anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party on October 10.
Kim Min-seok, spokesperson for South Korea's Defense Ministry, told reporters on Thursday that the South Korean military had not detected any signals indicating a launch might be imminent.
In the past, Pyongyang has notified relevant international organizations of plans to launch long-range rockets.
On Friday, the U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization told VOA they had not received such a notification from North Korea. North Korea is a member of both organizations.
The United States and North Korea have been at odds over Pyongyang's long-range rocket launch. Pyongyang insists the launch is part of a peaceful space mission involving a satellite. Washington rejects the claim, citing the Security Council resolutions banning the use of ballistic missile technology by Pyongyang.
A State Department spokesperson told VOA this week that multiple Security Council resolutions require North Korea to “stop conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology.”
Last week, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned North Korea of “severe consequences” if it conducted a long-range rocket launch or nuclear test.

Ottobock Healthcare technicians from Brazil, Canada and Germany have kicked off the final phase of preparations as the Official Prosthetic, Orthotic and Wheelchair Technical Service Provider for the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games by providing essential repair services at the International Wheelchair Rugby Championship. The Championship took place at the Olympic Park from 26-28 February, with Ottobock completing 37 repairs for competing teams.
Ottobock Brazil Technical Director, Thomas Pfleghar said: “Wheelchair rugby is one of the sports where there is the greatest demand for technical service at the Paralympic Games. Although rugby wheelchairs are designed to withstand constant bombardment, cracks to the metal frames are common.
“The sight of a welder in a mask with a flaming torch is not something people expect to see in sport, but it is essential to keep athletes in the competition. Our team for the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games will include seven specialist welders.”
Technical service for the International Wheelchair Rugby Championship was provided from a repair centre equipped with specialist machinery and tools for welding, wheel repairs and tyre replacements.
Ottobock has been a partner to the Paralympic Games since the Seoul 1988 Paralympic Games, providing technical service 13 times. The increased competition and use of equipment has seen demand for the service offered by Ottobock, one of the world's leading providers of prosthetics and wheelchairs, soar:
Services: Seoul 1988, London 2012, Rio 2016
Technical service team size: 4, 80, 77
Languages spoken: 3, 15, 26
Hours worked: 90; 10,000; 14,500 (estimate)
Repairs: 350; 2,062; 2,000 (estimate)
Spare parts shipped from Germany: 0; 15,000; 15,000
Specialist equipment and machinery shipped from Germany: 0; 9 tonnes; 9 tonnes
Athletes' village main repair centre: 0; 6,500 sq ft.; 7,000 sq ft.
Sports venue repair centres: 0, 9, 14
Like the pit lane in motor-racing, Ottobock's court-side technical service provides seamless equipment repairs returning Paralympians to action as fast as possible. This essential service will be provided by Ottobock at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games for all 4,350 athletes in 22 sports.
Repair centres will be staffed by a team of prosthetists, orthotists, wheelchair technicians and welders from 28 countries, including 10 from Brazil. The facilities will be fully equipped to repair any damage or problems with the equipment used by athletes during the Paralympic Games, including running blades, wheelchairs for rugby and basketball, racing wheelchairs, throwing frames, as well as custom made items, everyday prosthetics and wheelchairs.
The Ottobock technical service team for the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games will be made up of technicians from Argentina, Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Hungary, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Great Britain, Ukraine and the USA.

Alex Jones breaks down how Hillary Clinton may try and skip debates by claiming that they may not recover from their pneumonia until late October.
According to The Washington Post, Clinton could spend at least the next month attempting to recoup as the presidential race moves forward.
Clinton has struggled to speak for more than even half an hour on several occasions, even temporarily stalling a live Democratic debate in 2015 after allegedly needing an extended bathroom break.
Only just last week Infowars reporters discovered an EMT crew complete with a gurney appear from behind the stage at a Clinton speaking event – suggesting the candidate could be forced to unexpectedly leave a speech at any moment.
Will Hillary attempt to skip the debates, go head-to-head with Trump or will the ailing candidate be forced out by the Democratic Party in a last ditch effort to save the party?
Strange to hear Lewis Hamilton admit that they required the ‘reassurance' of their victory in Melbourne given that a flicker of self-doubt hadn't been apparent in the world champion's performance at any point over the weekend. Turning the tide in Practice Three after being narrowly out-paced by Nico Rosberg in Friday's warm-up acts, Hamilton's pole position effort was the lap of the weekend, a mesmerising charge which their team-mate called "awesome". It was also the decisive act behind their victory, providing the Englishman with the solid platform from which to deliver a masterclass of frontrunning driving to secure their seventh win in eight races and the perfect start to 2015.

On paper, the Australian GP was a closely-fought affair withjust 1.3 seconds behind Hamilton when the chequered flag fell. In reality, as Rosberg subsequently acknowledged, Hamilton was in cruise control and never really under threat. "Lewis didn't make any mistakes and it wasn't possible to get any closer,” the German admitted. Despite hour after hour in Mercedes' race simulator over the winter, Rosberg still appears bereft of a method with which to beat their team-mate in a straight fight - making their subdued defeat in Melbourne all the more disappointing. But give Nico's sportsmanship the credit it deserves. "Lewis did a fantastic job," they graciously acknowledged on the podium. "He drove like a world champion all weekend."A tad lucky at the start, when they bounced over the kerb and triggered carnage behind him, but all's well that ends well andclinched-fist celebration as they returned to Parc Ferme after the race said it all. For Ferrari and their new recruit, third place was as good as a victory. The only dispute is about who would have been more relieved: Ferrari, after only their third podium since November 2013, or Vettel with the instant validation of their decision to abandon the family nest at Red Bull for Ferrari. A driver who was purportedly considering quitting F1 last year has their mojo back.
A solid points forhaul from a solid performance. But no more than that.
Massa blamed “losing a second-and-a-half behind Daniel Ricciardo on my out-lap” for the loss of third position to Vettel but, as Williams chief Pat Symonds acknowledged afterwards, Ferrari had the faster package this weekend. Although they were disappointed to have finished fourth, Massa would surely have struggled to rebuff the advances of Kimi Raikkonen but for the Finn's costly first-lap aggravation and the impression throughout was that Williams were missing the muscular aggression of Valtteri Bottas.

The star of the race, Felipe Nasr's performance was the unexpected delight of a largely unmemorable grand prix as they collected fifth place for a team which didn't score a point in the whole of 2014.
Unfazed either by their debut or the off-track politicking which debased Sauber's reputation at the start of the weekend, Nasr didn't put a wheel off line as they beat Daniel Ricciardo to fifth. Sauber's description of their performance as “an outstanding achievement” was entirely justified. It's worth noting, too, that in qualifying they were nearly a second faster than Sauber team-mate Marcus Ericsson. Quite what Jolyon Palmer, who beat Nasr to the GP2 title last year, made of their former foe's performance is anyone's guess.

How the mighty have fallen. Daniel Ricciardo's plucky efforts in qualifying and the race cannot disguise that this was an anguished weekend for the Red Bull team. Incredibly, Renault seem even further behind their power-supplier rivals than they were a year ago, rendering Ricciardo's best efforts in front of their home crowd largely peripheral. A shame, because there's a great driver waiting to burst into the limelight.

Fortune tends to favour the brave and sometimes it even doffs a cap in the direction of a trier, too. Eighty seconds off the pace even before the first round of pit-stops, Nico Hulkenberg and Force India's seventh place was ultimately the consequence of the bad luck which occured elsewhere. But nobody could begrudge the model professional of the grid that rarest of bonuses in their career: slightly more than they deserved.

Credit Sauber for their smart strategy calls during Sunday's race, including a first-lap pit-stop under the Safety Car for a new set of soft tyres, that helped propel Marcus Ericsson into the points and credit the young Swede for their late move on Carlos Sainz to grab eighth. But Ericsson paled in comparison with the debutant Nasr and the jury remains out on whether they have the requisite pace for F1.

A points-scoring debut in F1 is no trifling achievement and Carlos Sainz's ninth place will have silenced the sceptics - for now at least. Over the course of the weekend, however, there were plenty of scruffy moments from the young Spaniard.

Sergio Perez in action
Sergio Perez would be well advised to consider a flutter on the lottery this week. Despite making a hash of overtaking the mobile chicane that goes by the name of a McLaren-Honda, and despite being half a minute down on team-mate Hulkenberg, the Mexican somehow found themselves in the points at the end of the race.

And the rest...
How low have McLaren fallen? So low that Jenson Button felt moved to describe Sunday's race as an enjoyable experience after finishing eleventh of the eleven runners who made it to the finishing line. In the context of the team's winter, in which they had previously failed to complete anything longer than a 12-lap stint, reaching the chequered flag was a giant step forward. But the fact that Button was twice lapped by the Mercedes car which out-paced the MP4-30 by five seconds in qualifying underlines just how far behind McLaren currently are.

Not a day to remember for Kimi Raikkonen. On the back foot after they were given a shove into the second corner, the Finn was on the road to recovery before a malfunctioning pit-stop forced them to retire. “It's simply that, today, everything happened to me,” bemoaned Kimi. True, but Raikkonen was also the architect of their own downfall with the mistake in qualifying which cost them third on the grid. But for that...

So near and yet so far for Max Verstappen. Already the youngest driver ever to start a grand prix, the Dutch teenager was well on course to become the youngest points scorer in the sport's history before their Toro Rosso developed a fever with twenty laps remaining. Still, even if the youngster won't be leaving Australia with any tangible points, they can at least take the consolation of knowing that they proved a point in Melbourne.

On a wretched day for the Lotus team, who must have fancied their chances of beating Red Bull and starting the season as the fourth-fastest outfit on the grid, neither Romain Grosjean nor Pastor Maldonado made it past the first lap. Grosjean can at least take solace in out-qualifying their team-mate, but for Maldonado there was just another accident to add to the list - albeit on this occasion in entirely blameless circumstances.

New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright met up with Gable Tostee in fun-loving Surfers Paradise. A few hours later they plunged 14 storeys to their death
Warriena Wright was visiting the Gold Coast in Australia when they matched on Tinder with Gable Tostee. They met up in the popular tourist nightspot of Surfers Paradise on a Thursday night and bought a six-pack of beer after spending a few minutes in a pub.
By the end of the date Wright was dead, having plunged 14 storeys from the balcony of Tostee's apartment, and two years later they are on trial in Queensland's supreme court charged with their murder.
The case centres around a 199-minute mobile recording made by Tostee which captured the fractious and ultimately fatal course of the pair's evening together, including the moment Wright fell to their death.
It is the key piece of evidence in the supreme court trial of Tostee, 30, who was standing on the other side of a locked glass door the moment Wright fell.

And the recording is cited by the crown as demonstration of their guilt, and by the defence as vindication of their innocence.
The pair had met that night, 7 August 2014, after making contact via Tinder a week earlier.
Wright, 26, from New Zealand, was in Australia to attend a friend's wedding as part of a two-week vacation that included skydiving and a room in a hotel in Surfers Paradise, near where Tostee lived.
CCTV shown to the court captured their meeting on Cavill Avenue in Surfers Paradise, where they exchanged a hug.
They went to a pub but stayed only a few minutes before deciding to head back to Tostee's apartment nearby, stopping at a bottle shop to buy a six-pack of beer.
Inside the apartment, Tostee says they later had sex in their bed.

They then went out to their balcony where they posed for photos together, Wright pulling faces, Tostee standing beside them bare-chested.
Wright's last contact with family was a Facebook message to a sister, in which they report having found a man who was the Australian answer to Sam Winchester, the Supernatural TV actor.
At 1am on 8 October, unbeknown to Wright, Tostee pressed record on a mobile phone in their pocket. They wouldn't turn it off until 199 minutes later. By then Wright was dead.
Tostee, having left the building via a basement carpark but still apparently unaware of their fate as police milled around the building, had called their father who urged them to contact a leading criminal lawyer. They had then eaten a pizza.
The crown case is that Tostee, who had locked Wright out on the balcony after their night had deteriorated into verbal and physical altercations, had left Wright in such a state of fear and intimidation that they felt compelled to flee.
When Wright's attempt to climb down from the balcony went horribly awry, Tostee was thus responsible for their death, the prosecution contends.
The prosecutor, Glen Cash, told the court in their opening address that at the very least Tostee meant to cause Wright grievous bodily harm, causing them to flee, resulting in their death.
Cash said Tostee's recording captured a moment where sounds were consistent with them choking or strangling Wright. They pleaded to be allowed to go home before repeatedly screaming “no” as they shoved them on to the balcony and shut the door.
Defence lawyers for Tostee, who has pleaded not guilty, deny any attempt by Tostee to strangle Wright.
Their barrister, Saul Holt, has told the court that Tostee used reasonable force to subdue Wright, who had grown “increasingly erratic” while drinking heavily. They had taken to randomly, with no apparent provocation, hitting Tostee, threatening violence, throwing ornamental rocks – one of their interior decorations – at their head and hitting them with the clamp of their telescope.
Holt argued that Tostee, after tackling Wright to the floor and forcing them on to the balcony, put them both in a position of safety by shutting the door.
Tostee was entitled to lock the door on someone who was violent and disorderly, Holt submitted.

“She is outside, they are inside and they have caused a locked door to be between the two of them,” Holt told the court.
“What happened in this case is nothing like murder or manslaughter. It doesn't fit.”
Holt said the fact that the critical part of the evening was recorded on Tostee's phone meant there was “very little in dispute” between the crown and the defence apart from the allegation about choking her, which was in “absolute dispute”, and their culpability for their death.
The audio recording, which was discovered by police on a Sony Xperia phone they found in Tostee's father's car, has been released by the court.
It captures an early morning conversation awkwardly traversing topics from architecture to religion, as James Blunt and Kanye West play in the background.
The talk is punctuated by Tostee's occasional cries of “Ow!” as Wright punches him. They tell them to “chill and have a drink”.
“You love beating me up like a Kiwi,” Tostee says. Wright tells them they beat people up all the time.
Tostee quips that they will end up looking “like a piece of tenderised meat” if they keep hitting him.
They ask them if they can tell their mother she's “not a loser”. They talk about their dog that died, their belief in justice and the afterlife.
Tostee says: “We die. That's it. Throw me off the balcony.” They talk of “three things that are really good on this Earth: food, sleep and sex”.
They say there are “no gods”. They say: “I've seen stuff though.”
Wright tells him: “I am going to go vampire on your arse.”
Tostee yells “Ow!” again. He's still laughing. Wright's speech starts to lose its coherence. They shout “Forrest Gump” repeatedly, then “I'm a ninja – it's not funny.” More cries of “Ow!” from Tostee.

They go to leave and they ask them if they want them to walk them back to their apartment. The music stops and Wright asks where their belongings are. Tostee offers to call their mobile phone. They accuse Tostee of stealing their phone and handbag and an argument breaks out.
“Where's my fucking shit? I will fucking destroy your jaw. It's not fucking funny. I'm going to call the police.”
Tostee says: “I should have never given you so much to drink. I thought we were going to have fun. I don't deserve this shit. I'm a nice fucking guy.”
Tostee finds their phone and calm returns. Wright says they have money in NZ and gets taken advantage of.
Tostee asks her: “Do you even remember what you were doing to me half an hour ago? You were beating me up for no reason. You thought it was funny.”
They suggest they “sit down for a second so we can discuss”.
“I've met some weird people off Tinder. I'm the most tolerant person in the world,” they said.
Wright says they would help anyone in need. Tostee says she's “a bit violent though”.
Wright talks about taking a look out the window, and Tostee tells her: “Don't jump off or anything.”
Wright shrieks “help” in a mock high-pitched voice, adding that she's only joking. Tostee tells them the “men in white coats” are coming.
“You're kind of mental, but in a really cute way,” they tell them
Wright goes to the bathroom and Tostee whispers into their phone: “God help me. Shit.”
Wright returns. Slurring their words, they begin whispering to Tostee about “Sam”, later exhorting them to: “Bow down to Sam.”
They yell “Ouch” then “I'll bow down.”
That signals Tostee's apparent switch from annoyance to anger.
They tell her: “That's more than enough. You've worn out your welcome. You're not my kind of girl. You have to leave.”

In Tostee's account, their tackling of Wright to the floor of the apartment follows them striking them with a telescope.
The prosecution claims that is when the sound consistent with Tostee choking Wright can be heard, which they deny.
“You are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony, you goddamn psycho little bitch,” they say.
“Who the fuck do you think I am? Yeah, do your muay thai now.”
Wright, their mouth sounding muffled, says they are sexist.
“I'm the one who's injured. You don't have a goddamn scratch on you,” Tostee says.
“I thought you were just playing around. But you're psycho. Goddamn psycho.
“I'm going to let you go, I'm going to walk you out of this apartment just the way you are. You're not going to collect any of your belongings or anything, you're just going to walk out and I'm going to slam the door on you. You understand? If you try and pull anything I'll knock you out. I'll knock you the fuck out.”
Tostee tells Wright to “get up”.
“I'm sorry,” Wright says.
“I don't care. Get up,” Tostee says.
Tostee, apparently still restraining Wright, tells them over and over: “You don't understand do you?”
“You think you can hit me and I just fall down like in the movies?
Wright tells them repeatedly to “Let go”.
Tostee: “Who the fuck do you think you are?”
Wright: “No, no, no, no … ”
Tostee: “You trying to kill me, huh? Why'd you try and hit me with that, huh?”
Wright is screaming “no” over and over again.
“This is all on recording you know. It's all being recorded,” Tostee says.
Wright pleads: “Just let me go home.”
Tostee says: “I would but you've been a bad girl.”
The glass door clicks shut and Wright's screams fade. Tostee sighs. Less than 20 seconds pass when Wright screams as they slip from the balcony rail.
Tostee's barrister, Holt, in their opening address on Monday, told the jury the moment when the screaming Wright was being locked on the balcony was a horrible one to listen to “because you know what comes next”.
But the recording contained a sequence of events that would bear out their client's innocence of their murder, Holt argued.
“It really is, all in the recording,” they said.
The trial continues.
Warlords of Draenor Press Events - Gameplay Footage and Spoilers
I played a gnome warrior in the Shadowmoon Valley, the Alliance starting zone. After about 5 hours of /played and 80 quests I reached the end of the zone and Level 92.
At level 91, I had 63k health as a Tank.
Monsters had around 100k health.
I was dealing around 1k to 5k damage on normal hits. Up to 10k critical damage for some abilities (Shield Slam).
It takes 597k XP to go from level 90 to level 91 and 640k xp to go from level 91 to 92.
Quests rewards were between 10k and 15k xp. Up to 20k for the difficult ones.
A new quest type is available: the "Bonus Objectives". When you walk around a zone, new objectives might appear randomly in your quest list. Completing the objectives will reward you with extra experience, leaving the area will drop the quest.
Shadowmoon Valley is composed of lush green plains lit by the moonlight. It has a very peaceful feeling. The glades and forests are amazing and very colorful. You will find Naarus, Draeneis cities, and Iron Horde strongholds in the zone.
The Alliance starting zone seems pretty much finished. Lots of details, impressive vegetation, and a lot of different monsters.
I found a lot of monsters from The Burning Crusade that have been updated: Talbuks, Nether rays, Turtles, Larvas, Boars, Sporebats, Wolves, Bees. The new Talbuks and Sporebats models are EPIC.
Ner'zhul is the principal antagonist of the zone.
The zone ends with a scenario that I couldn't test because it wasn't available. It was called "Grommar's Purge" (Note: roughly translated)
I found the zone really well made. The vast plains and colorful glades immerse you entirely in the game. The scenery is new and doesn't give you a feeling of deja vu (except for some monsters, but it's not really shocking).
The new race models are great (I could also create a female dwarf). The facial expressions are awesome!
The new soundtrack is also very good.
When asked about the beta, Ion Hazzikostas answered : SoonTM.
SPOILER
Ner'zhul uses an evil force, the Void Terror. At the end of the zone, you fight Ner'zhul and they manage to corrupt a Naaru into a "Dark Naaru". To purify the Naaru, Velen sacrifices themselves and dies. This is a pretty huge plot twist and their death will be part of a cinematic at the end of the quest. It is followed by a giant battle. You join Maraad (freed from Ner'zhul earlier) to fight the Iron Horde.

Maine's largest city is laying plans for a new, modern emergency shelter that could operate 24 hours a day and consolidate a variety of services to support and rehouse people facing homelessness.
And it could be located in the industrial outskirts of Portland, away from downtown where services are now concentrated.
Over the last decade, about one-third of the people using Portland's Oxford Street Shelter have come from other Maine cities and towns. Portland started billing those communities this year, but now the Maine Welfare Directors Association says they shouldn't pay. Staff photo by Derek Davis
Last week, the Planning Board advanced a proposal to the City Council that would allow shelters as conditional uses in industrial zones and other business zones. Currently, homeless shelters are only allowed in Portland's downtown zone. The proposal also adds conditions that shelters must meet to be approved.
“I really feel like it's an essential first step,” said City Councilor Belinda Ray, who oversees the Health and Human Services Committee, which drafted the proposal. “It's the first step of a long journey that will provide us with a facility to offer better services and also a better environment for residents and staff.”
The council could vote on the new zoning rules as early as June 5. Next year's budget includes $125,000 in preliminary planning work. Ray said creating a group to select a location and finalize what type of facility and services should be included will be among the committee's top priorities. They noted that the change would open up areas in all five council districts.
Meanwhile, city officials have already commissioned a conceptual floor plan of a modern, single-story shelter that complies with the new zoning rules. That plan, which contemplates a 186-person shelter, was included in the Planning Board's meeting packet.
Portland has had a policy of providing shelter to anyone in need since the 1980s. Since then, the number of homeless people has increased significantly, while other nonprofit shelters have closed, due to a lack of funding.
Portland has seen a surge in homelessness ever since the 2008 recession. Although officials have made strides in placing long-term shelter stayers in permanent housing, the number of people using a shelter has remained fairly consistent. In January, an average of 443 people were staying in city's six shelters, which also serve people from other Maine communities, other U.S. states and people from other countries.
The city's Oxford Street Shelter has 154 beds and is only open 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. during the week and 1 p.m. to 8 a.m. on weekends, an arrangement that forces people back onto the streets of downtown Portland during the day. The number of people seeking overnight shelter routinely exceeds capacity, requiring the use of overflow space at the nonprofit Preble Street, which can accommodate 75 people.
City Manager Jon Jennings said the three-story structure on Oxford Street is not safe for either staff or people seeking shelter.
“The current shelter is an abomination and that's not a reflection of city staff, but of how we've essentially warehoused people in an old apartment building,” Jennings said. “What people see on Oxford Street today would be very different than what they'd see in a new shelter.”
City officials have been researching options for a new shelter for over a year. In addition to looking at best practices across the country, officials visited shelters in Massachusetts and in Bangor. Shelters in Cambridge and Quincy, Massachusetts, were located away from downtown areas, but were open 24 hours a day and contained food, counseling and housing services on site.
Opening up new areas
The new zoning rules would allow emergency shelters in industrial zones and business zones along the city's western-most border, as well as along Warren Avenue and around Morrill's Corner. Areas in Libbytown, St. John Street, Marginal Way and Anderson Street in East Bayside, and East Deering would also be opened up.
However, the new zoning rules would require shelters to be located within a quarter-mile of a Metro bus route. That distance could be extended to half a mile if the shelter provides daytime indoor shelter space and develops a plan to help stayers use public transit.
Other conditions include requiring a management plan that would in part ensure the safety and security of stayers and staff as well as address any concerns from neighbors. A shelter must also provide an outdoor area for stayers that is screened in, and provide laundry service, showers, a kitchen, pantry and secure storage, among other things.
Much of the new property opened up by the new zoning is located on the outskirts of the city.
Mayor Ethan Strimling said they would support a new shelter on the outskirts, as long as access to services and transportation is maintained.
Strimling said they have also reached out to surrounding communities in the Metro Coalition – South Portland, Westbrook, Cape Elizabeth, Scarborough and Falmouth – about taking a more regional approach to building and funding homeless shelters.
“It was a good first step,” Strimling said. “Surrounding communities … were interested in exploring further how we might be able to work together.”
But not everyone is on board with the idea of moving the shelter too far from downtown.
Mark Swann, executive director of Preble Street, a nonprofit social service agency that runs a soup kitchen and day shelter downtown, said Wednesday that they generally support the city's efforts to open more zones to emergency shelters, but worried about locating them on the outskirts of town.
“Preble Street also supports that idea in theory, but would also want to be sure that any new zoning would not simply be pushing poor people into industrial parks and the like in an effort to hide the problem,” Swann said. “Besides the obvious concerns about transportation and access to services, we also feel that being part of a community and having a sense of belonging is critically important to a person's health, recovery and life.”
The conceptual floor plan for a new shelter shows a single-story building with 126 beds for men and 60 beds for women. The sleeping quarters for men and women, which include restrooms and showers, are separated by a laundry room and a central office. The plan includes a dining room for 136 people, and outdoor park, locker room and private rooms for counseling.
Dawn Stiles, the city's Health and Human Service Director, said the city has not finalized a plan or location for a new 186-person shelter. Neither Stiles, nor the head of the city's planning office, could say whether zoning change would open up any city-owned parcels.
“We do not have a location and have not begun a search – the rezoning is the first step in the process,” Stiles said.
When asked for additional information about the floor plan, City Hall spokesperson Jessica Grondin said the plan was “based on history, experience and estimated need with the on-site services.” However, they further clarified that the plan was not a final draft, but it did include the items the city would like to see in a new shelter.
Where there is space
Some advocates, however, would like the city to build smaller shelters in different parts of the city.
Bill Higgins, who has been homeless in the past and is now an advocate for the Homeless Voices for Justice, said they would like the city to build three or four smaller shelters throughout the city, rather than building one large facility. “It needs to be dispersed,” they said, pointing to the impact the existing shelter has had on Bayside.
During Tuesday's Planning Board meeting, city officials acknowledged any new shelter would likely be built far from the downtown area.
“A lot of those areas are off the peninsula,” Planning and Urban Development Direct Jeff Levine said. “That's where there's space.”
Although the Planning Board voted 6-1 to send a positive recommendation to loosen the zoning to the City Council, some board members were concerned about putting a shelter in an industrial zone, especially one on the outskirts of town.
Board member Carol Morrissette cast the only dissenting vote on Tuesday, strictly over the inclusion of the industrial zones.
“I don't think anyone should be living in an industrial zone – that's not what the intention of the zone is for,” Morrissette said. “I know that's an integral part of it, but I do look forward to the fresh approach to housing our homeless that the city of Portland is taking on.”
Board member Brandon Mazer said they were initially skeptical of opening up industrial areas, but has come to realize that it may be the only area where a single-story shelter meeting the city's needs could be built.
“If it's a choice between not having a modern shelter and having one, I'd rather have one that works, wherever it is,” Mazer said.
Nonprofit social service agencies and housing providers such as Community Housing of Maine, the Milestone Foundation and the Shalom House all supported the proposal.
Jeff McNally, director for community outreach at the Milestone Foundation, a nonprofit that operates a shelter for people who are intoxicated, noted the possible benefits of moving homeless people out of the downtown area.
“Anyone who is trying to maintain any sort of sobriety that's staying in Bayside has a hard hill time to climb. It's where a lot of the dealers go and hang out,” they said.
If the proposal is approved by the council, Jennings said staff would like to conduct an analysis of the specific properties in the new areas. They said the city could either build on land it already owns, or look for a private landowner to partner with.
“We're open to any possibility,” they said. “The public-private partnership is something we're looking at across-the-board.”

The look on Greg Anderson's face showed something was bothering him. They had just beaten Erica Enders during the quarterfinals of the NHRA Sonoma Nationals in which both drivers took .16 of a second to stage.
Anderson's displeasure, in their words, had nothing to do with the staging duel and everything to do with what they felt was poor sportsmanship displayed following the final round at the NHRA Route 66 Nationals. Enders defeated Anderson to become the first female driver to win an NHRA Pro Stock event.
“Sorry for their luck,” Anderson told ESPN2's Gary Gerould when asked about potential gamesmanship on the starting line. “Sorry for their luck. It's always good when you race them and I've said it all along … they kicked my butt in Chicago. I really didn't appreciate some of the things they did after that race … it was, in my mind, a little unprofessional. I think the karma train got them a little bit there. She's a great racer but you have to be professional.”
Anderson declined to give more insight to their comments. Sources have told CompetitionPlus.com the source of Anderson's ire stemmed from a photo taken of Enders holding their trophy in the air alongside of their hauler and posted on the Internet.
Sonoma was the third race since Enders win earlier this month.
“She's a great racer … just gotta be professional,” Anderson reiterated.
Enders was taken aback by Anderson's comments.
“I was brought up to be respectful and sportsmanlike no matter if I win or lose. I distinctly remember going over and shaking their hand after we beat him. He's loaded my butt on the trailer after they beat me many times and it's a d*** shame that I went red against him, they were a little late today.
“I've done nothing but speak highly of them and their team, Summit and the guys over there,” Enders said. “I think they're great and to be the best you have to beat the best. If we did something unsportsmanship-like, I wish he'd have brought it to my attention.”
The ESPN2 cameras picked up bits and pieces of the conversation where Anderson could clearly be heard asking, “Why did you do it?” Enders responded, “When your sponsor asks you to hold your trophy up …” before the audio trailed off.
Walking away Enders said to Anderson, “That's the wrong time to say something like that.”

A Scottish man who bought war medals from World War One at auction has returned them to the soldier's home town in Canada, 98 years after their death.
John Cunningham, a 60-year-old from East Renfrewshire, bought three medals awarded to Cpl Thomas Warburton Hooper, after finding out the soldier had a personal connection to their family.
Cpl Hooper's name arose by coincidence in an online search while Mr Cunningham was reading about their grandfather, who also fought in WW1.
They found out that both men had fought for the Lord Strathcona's Horse regiment on the lead up to the Battle of Morueil Wood in France. They had shared a battlefield at Bois de Genlis.
When Cpl Hooper's medals appeared at auction in Liverpool, Mr Cunningham said they knew what they had to do.
Speaking to the BBC Good Morning Scotland programme, they said: "When I saw the date and realised who they belonged to, I bought them at once. I had to have them."
The medals - a 1914/1915 Star, a British War medal, and a Victory Medal - were identical to those awarded to their own grandfather, except for the inscription.
Mr Cunningham's research revealed that Cpl Hooper, from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, had died during the battle at Bois de Genlis on 23 March 1918.
They had been serving a support role - probably looking after horses - but was killed when they were called to the front line to contain an enemy advance, according to a distant relative in Prince Edward Island, David Hooper.
Barely escaping with their own life that day was Mr Cunningham's grandfather, Cpl Donald McLeod, who was wounded in the fighting.
"He was lucky to get away because the Germans were bayoneting the wounded as they came through. They weren't in the mood for taking prisoners that day", Mr Cunningham said.
"I may not have been talking to you now had things gone the other way for my grandfather."
After the auction, it was decided by Mr Cunningham that Cpl Hooper's medals should be returned to their rightful home.
They said: "I got them and thought 'what do I do with them now?'
"I felt I had to pass them on; do something with them."
Image copyright Laura Chapin/CBC Image caption Mr Cunningham donated the medals to the Prince Edward Island Regiment Museum
In late 2015, Mr Cunningham began to contact the media on Prince Edward Island, Canada, hoping they would be able to track down relatives of Cpl Thomas Hooper.
Greg Gallant, curator at the PEI Regiment Museum, Charlottetown, joined the search alongside a genealogist but found that there were no immediate relatives of Cpl Hooper left on the island.
Instead, they suggested that Mr Cunningham donated the medals to the museum. They agreed.
Mr Gallant said: "I feel that these medals are yet another piece of that puzzle that we're always trying to build."
The Charlottetown community has also been welcoming of Mr Cunningham's donation.
"People have approached me and said 'I hear you've got the medals!' It's nice," said Mr Gallant.
They have since been cleaned and mounted, and the museum plans to have them "front and centre" of an upcoming WW1 anniversary exhibit.
The museum is continuing its search for Cpl Hooper's next of kin.

Mr Cunningham's grandfather, Cpl McLeod, lived through the war despite being twice wounded.
They died on 31 December 1972 and is buried in Eaglesham cemetery, alongside their wife and Mr Cunningham's parents.
They hope that some good can come from their donation of the medals.
Mr Cunningham said: "I would hope that at some point, their (Cpl Hooper's) family, if they still exist, will maybe have the chance to see them and get something from them."
"I didn't want to glorify this in any way, it's really just to remember things. So people can look back."

Last week there was a great deal of outraged reaction to the news that President Obama quietly signed Executive Order 13618, which provides the Department of Homeland Security with emergency powers over civilian telecommunications, including private telephone, cellular, and wireless networks. Defenders of the Order point out that it simply extends earlier executive orders signed by President Reagan in 1984 and renewed by President George W. Bush in 2003, granting governmental agencies the power to establish emergency communications systems for use in the event of a nuclear strike or act of terrorism.
Critics of Obamas extension of these emergency powers over private communications networks are referred to the 1934 Communications Act, which authorizes the president to cause the closing of any facility or station for wire communication and gives them control of any such facility or station if a state of waror the threat of oneexists.
Yet, President Obama also faced similar opposition to their signing of the National Defense Resources Preparedness Executive Order earlier this spring, which gives the president virtually complete control over the entire U.S. economyincluding energy, transportation, human resources, raw materialsupon their or their declaration that national defense requires doing so. This move, as Obamas defenders were quick to point out, was simply an extension of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which has been reauthorized and amended to be continuously in force ever since. Thus, while it, too, provides the president absolute, totalitarian powers over the private sector, theres little new in this latest iteration.
In fact, when we pause to consider every unprecedented extension of executive power, we find precedents galore. The oft-decried USA PATRIOT Act, which President Obama themselves had promised to abolish but opted instead to extend, was itself rooted in Clinton-era anti-terrorist legislation that weakened individual privacy protections and loosened judicial oversight of domestic spying activities.
So why the excitement now over what are essentially simply instances of executive power-creep?
For one thing, there are so many more Executive Orders being issued. During the whole of World War II, Presidents Roosevelt and Truman issued just seven, and even Richard Nixon issued only one. Fast-forward thirty years to the George W. Bush administration, which issued 62 over their eight years in the White House. President Obama will likely topple this number in their first term alone, having already issued 61.
And perhaps its our increasing awareness that the bar for what constitutes a national emergency has been lowered considerably. These gray areas, exemplified by the U.N. Security Councils admission that it is unable to clearly define terrorism, make it that much more likely that a president would actually invoke these powers with less provocation than in previous eras when there was a greater shared understanding of what should precipitate such extreme measures. Most of these powers can be traced to the Cold War era, when everyone knew what threat would trigger transforming the U.S. into a fascist economy and activate the Emergency Broadcast System: nuclear attack.
Today, under the guise of the War on Terror, civil liberties have been preemptively stripped at a galloping pace under the flimsiest of supposed threats. If a Nobel Peace Prizewinning president would signin the absence of an immediate threatthe National Defense Authorization Act for 2012, which provides for the indefinite detention of any American citizen without charge or trial, then it takes little imagination to assume that they or a future commander-in-chief would not hesitate to shut down civilian Internet access or private cell service in the name of preventing communications among terrorists, or against the threat of civic unrest.
Lest you think Im engaging in hyperbole, consider the precedent set last year in San Francisco, arguably the most liberal, civil rightsconscious city in the country. Yet last August, the acting director of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system preemptively blocked all access to private cell phone communication by anyone in four public BART stations because they believed protestors planned to use cell communications to coordinate their protests. They were able to shut off cell access solely on their own authority. When questioned, the director defended their actions by citing a 1969 ruling, under which you can put public safety above free speech. Even in this supposed cradle of civil liberties, the post-incident debate concentrated on defining conditions that would allow for these measures to be taken again in the future, rather than calling into question whether such preemptive action ought ever be taken.
Ironically, such emergency powers, ostensibly necessary to preserve our security, may in practice actually render us less secure. As the history of warfrom the British experience in the American Revolution to recent Soviet and American experience in Afghanistanhas shown, there is no harder fight to win than one against active civilian resistance. But a population isolated from information other than through officialand thus less free-flowingchannels would be far less equipped to respond quickly to and resist attack; any enemy would likely have an easier job of prevailing.
As a case in point, on 9/11 the critical difference between Flight 93s failure to reach its target and the successful strikes of the other three flights was the access of Flight 93s passengers to cell phone communication. Informed through these calls of what was happening in New York and at the Pentagon, passengers onboard Flight 93 chose not to follow the standard operating procedure of cooperating with their hijackers. Instead, the passengers organized and carried out the successful assault on the cockpit that led to the planes crashing into a Pennsylvania field, preventing an untold number of additional deaths had the flight reached its destination.
Had Executive Order 13618 been enacted prior to 9/11, and had the president invoked it to take control of private cell communications in an attempt to restrict the terrorists communications with one another, Flight 93 might well instead have been the fourth plane to hit its intended target: likely, the White House or U.S. Capitol Building. Thus, the question: Do emergency powers make us all less safe?
Supporters of George W. Bush who protest President Obamas extension of Executive Orders need to remember that they established the precedent of concentrating power within the Executive branch under the guise of emergency. Likewise, President Obamas supporters might wish to also bear in mind that powers vested in one Executive are available to, and invariably extended by, the next. Do they really want any president to be able to indefinitely detain vaguely defined suspects at their or their sole discretion?
For above all, no one can anticipate whose hand will be at the switch in the future, to what unforeseen ends such powers may be used, or what unintended consequences may result. Perhaps its thus time for a serious reconsideration of the entire trend to government by decree.
When our Alien Overlords finally do return to Earth and make that ever important “First Contact” with 21st century Man, it will be up to one person to make sure that the oh so important first impression made upon them is a good one.
Oh, and this person will not be a world leader…
Or a noted general…
No, that person honored with being the Official Representative of the Human Race is…
This woman…
Mazian Othman.
Mazian Othman is the head of the little spoken of United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (or UNOoOSA for short).
And now they have been appointed by the United Nations to be the Ambassador of Earth to our returning Alien Overlords.
Othman, an obscure Malaysian astrophysicist, is expected to describe their role as Earth Ambassador at a science conference next week at the Royal Society's Kavli conference centre in Buckinghamshire.
 They are scheduled to tell delegates that the recent discovery of hundreds of planets around other stars has made the detection of extraterrestrial life more likely than ever before - and that means the UN must be ready to coordinate humanity's response to any “first contact”.
During a talk Othman gave recently to fellow scientists, they said: “The continued search for extraterrestrial communication, by several entities, sustains the hope that someday humankind will receive signals from extraterrestrials. When we do, we should have in place a coordinated response that takes into account all the sensitivities related to the subject. The UN is a ready-made mechanism for such coordination.”
(Because they seem to be able to handle everything else they decide to put themselves in charge of so well…)
Take me to your leader…
The news of naming Othman as Earth's official ambassador came along with an announcement by the UNOoOSA that would be beginning to draft the “Official Protocol” for what we- as a world- are to do when we finally do make contact with the aliens.
Prompting the move is believed to be an official announcement where astronomers are expected to announce, perhaps later this year or early next year, that our satellites (such as Keplerand and Corot) have identified earth-like planets in space. So far, as many as 500 large Jupiter-sized planets have been discovered (being smaller, Earth like planets are to harder to "see" with our current technology).
Resistance is futile…
While many respected scientists do not necessarily disagree with the thought that there may be life on one of those distant hypothesized Earth-like planets, many – like noted genius (and Rayden lookalike) Dr. Michio Kaku- believe that it may be too soon (and too presumptive) to begin planning for the world altering first meeting between the two civilizations.
According to Dr. Kaku:
“… There are several problems facing such an attempt, however. If the SETI Project can eaves drop on messages from extra-terrestrial civilizations, then it will take many decades to centuries for us to return the message, because the aliens could be many light years away. So it would be a one-way conversation. Even a simple conversation would be impossible. All we can do is listen to their communications.
Second, most earth-like planets we find in space, even if they have oceans and life forms, will probably only have microbial life on them. So simply finding such planets is not enough. Advanced civilizations in space are probably very rare. Third, we should wait until we find out if the aliens are hostile or not. We should monitor them for years before actively trying to reach out to them…”
They believe that “First contact” will be rather distant and slow and that in order to have the neat and orderly “First Contact” to occur it would require the aliens to “…land on the front lawn…”
“… The only way that a two-way dialog can take place with such aliens is if they actually visit us, e.g. land on the White House lawn. Then we can make direct contact with them. (But the problem here is that, if they can travel such vast distances to reach us from distant stars, then they have probably already done so, and have been observing us for years. So, even if we find evidence of earth-like planets, it does not guarantee that our protocols will mean anything.)
So, personally, I think it is prudent to draft such protocols. However, there is no guarantee that we will ever have to use them.”
Granted… they might just be pissed that they didn't get the gig as “Official Earth Ambassador”.
Personally, I don't see the harm in the drafting of protocol though… never a bad idea to have a plan in order… ya know, just in case…
(Even if it is a shitty, half assed, bound to get us sucked into an “unwinnable intergalactic war we can't win” plan drafted by an organization that can't figure out a way to keep crazy human nations from stockpiling weapons and declaring war on one another.)
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian flour millers and global trading companies have sewn up deals to import 500,000 tonnes of premium Australian wheat since March, trade sources said, the biggest such purchases in more than a decade despite surplus stocks at home.

Concerns that untimely rains in February and March would cut wheat output, especially of high-protein varieties used to make pizzas and pasta, first drove millers in India's southern ports to place the orders.
Attractive prices then prompted traders such as Cargill, Louis Dreyfus and Glencore to follow, said three sources directly involved in the deals.
The traders and millers could import a further 500,000 tonnes from France and Russia, where harvests are around the corner. The deals could push up benchmark prices that have already jumped on recent concerns about crop quality in the United States.
“There are strong chances French and Russian wheat will find their way to India because of attractive prices ... and if the euro goes down, I expect more French wheat coming to India,” one source said.
Almost half of the quantity contracted so far — bought at $255 to $275 a tonne — has reached India and the rest is scheduled for July delivery, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they are not allowed to discuss trade-sensitive issues publicly.
Although rains and hailstorms wilted the Indian wheat crop, the world's second-biggest producer and consumer of the grain has large stockpiles accumulated after eight straight years of bumper harvests.
MONSOON CONCERNS
But the government is likely to draw heavily from its warehouses this year if monsoon rains, critical for farm irrigation, turn out to be deficient, thereby fueling food inflation. India's weather office has cut this year's monsoon forecast to 88 percent of a long-term average, raising fears of the first drought in six years.
Industry and government officials estimate this year's wheat output at about 90 million tonnes, nearly 5 percent lower than the 2014 harvest but still exceeding domestic demand of about 72 million tonnes.
Since wheat is largely grown in India's central and northern plains, flour millers from southern states, hemmed in by the Indian Ocean, sometimes find it attractive to import high-protein grades from Australia.
But this year's unusually large volumes have surprised some.
“Other than large amounts of wheat that we're importing, we see two other significant changes,” said one of the sources. “Perhaps for the first time, some imports are taking place in vessels and perhaps for the first time millers will end up buying French and Russian wheat as well.”
At about $185 to $190 a tonne on a free-on-board basis, French and Russian wheat is attractive for India, another source said.
High-protein wheat in India costs more than $300 a tonne and imports could ebb if prices fall to about $283, the sources said.
Russian wheat, however, could fall short of India's quality requirements despite a higher protein content than French wheat, said Tajinder Narang, a New Delhi-based trade analyst.
NEW DELHI — At least 16 people, including a prominent politician, were killed Saturday when Maoist guerrillas ambushed a convoy of political leaders in Chhattisgarh State, the authorities said. Among the dead were five police officers.
The politician, Mahendra Karma, a senior member of the Chhattisgarh Indian National Congress Party, was killed, and the state party president, Nandkumar Patel, as well as their newly married son were missing, Mukesh Gupta, a state police official, said in an telephone interview late Saturday night.
The victims were in a convoy of vehicles, escorted by the police, that was headed to Jagdalpur from Sukma in central India. As the convoy traveled between two valleys in a heavily forested area between 5 and 6 p.m., a bomb exploded, and 200 to 300 guerrillas opened fire, Mr. Gupta said.
Mr. Karma had been given considerable protection, including a bulletproof vehicle, but they were not riding in it at the time of the attack, Mr. Gupta said. Mr. Patel has also always been given tight police security.
Donald Trump made the words “You're fired” a part of American pop culture during their time on NBC's “The Apprentice.” But it turns out they may have had much less of a role in deciding who got the boot than it seemed, at least according to Clay Aiken.
During a recent appearance on “Domecast,” a podcast by North Carolina's News & Observer, Aiken revealed that Trump had very little say in decisions when Aiken was on the “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2012.
“Trump didn't decide who got fired on ‘Apprentice,'” they said. “NBC made those decisions.”
At another point, Aiken said, “He [Trump] didn't make those decisions, they didn't fire those people. It was very much, ‘I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.'”
Steve Mack via Getty Images “He didn't make those decisions, they didn't fire those people," Clay Aiken said of Donald Trump.
According to Aiken, the show even set up little ways to help Trump along through filming.
“There used to be a little thing right on their desk that looked like a phone,” Aiken said. “He pretended it was a phone, but it was actually a teleprompter where the producers were sending them notes.”
Aiken may be a Democrat who once ran for Congress in North Carolina, but they tried to clarify that they aren't trying “to be incendiary” with their comments. They simply wanted people to know that “Trump isn't the business person that people believe they are.”
“He did look like they were leading. But on ‘The Apprentice' they don't lead,” Aiken said. “He's told by the producers, ‘Here's what happened. Here's who should win.'”
Now that Trump has risen from a TV personality to president of the United States, Aiken can't help but imagine Trump is “leading the country in the same way that they did ‘The Apprentice.'”
They said, “I think to myself, the man as president definitely has a teleprompter sitting on their desk right now with people telling him, ‘Well such and such is in the healthcare bill, don't say this.'”
But, they added, “I feel like half the time their teleprompter has broken down as president and they don't know what's going on.”
WOW! Jon Girodes, the #racist #Republican #Senate candidate for New York's 30th District (#Harlem) said that they will bring Kool Aid, KFC and watermelons to a campaign event. #america2016 #amerikkka A post shared by The Unapologetic Black Man ✊ (@theunapologeticblackman) on Oct 12, 2016 at 11:51am PDT
Much has been made this campaign season about the best way to woo black voters.
Hillary Clinton has seized on police violence against blacks, telling the NAACP this summer that police have to “stop the killings of African Americans.” Donald Trump says the Democratic Party has “failed and betrayed the African American community” and he's offering blacks “a much better future.”
In New York, state senate candidate Jon Girodes is taking a different route: The Republican is offering black voters fried chicken, Kool-Aid and watermelon.
Yep.
Girodes is a candidate in New York's 30th Senate District, which includes the historically black communities of Harlem and East Harlem.
A month before Election Day, reporters for New York's NBC 4 were exchanging emails with Girodes about a disputed real estate deal. Apparently unprompted, Girodes wrote at the bottom of one email to NBC 4:
“Ps I'm hosting an event in Harlem which will be in front of the state building in a few weeks. We will [donate] Kool Aid, KFC and watermelons to the public on 125th street in Harlem. Please join us to help the community.”
[Yesterday's Ku Klux Klan members are today's police officers, councilwoman says]
NBC 4, not missing an opportunity, printed Girodes's statement on a large placard and took it to the city streets, talking to residents about the comments.
“It's racist,” Tyrone Nero told the station during an interview on 125th Street. “Whoever they are, I think they should go back in whatever hole they crawled in and have a great life.”
Girodes did not return messages from The Washington Post seeking comment. Their campaign website appeared to be down, along with their campaign's Facebook page, Twitter feed and YouTube channel.
In their response to NBC 4, they said their words weren't offensive.
“What I think is anyone who gives free food to people is doing them a favor,” they said, according to the station. “Get a bunch of people who say it's offensive and let me go into their neighborhood and give it out for free and see if they take it.”
Inexplicably, they also sent an NBC 4 reporter a shirtless picture.
“Run with it and have fun,” the text beneath it said. “My gift to you :-)”

State Sen. Bill Perkins (D), who is defending their seat against Girodes, said “it's important to out [Girodes's remarks] not just to denounce them but to set a tone in this neighborhood and in this city that this type of offense does not go unchallenged.”
[‘Make America White Again': A politician's billboard ignites uproar]
Earlier this year, the Huffington Post published an article headlined “Here Are 13 Examples of Donald Trump Being Racist.” Trump has accused a judge of being biased because of their Mexican heritage. During the Democratic National Convention, when the father of a Muslim soldier killed in the line of duty criticized Trump, the Republican nominee posited that the man's wife, who stood beside him, wasn't allowed to have anything to say.
In New York, some potential voters seemed to be taking Girodes's comments in stride.
“If this is true it is beyond ignorant and they have no place in public office,” one man wrote on NBC4's Facebook page. “That being said, I personally love watermelon and fried chicken, so please keep me posted on the dates and locations of these events. Thanks.”

TAMPA — Coach Jon Cooper said they at first did not know what to make of the well-wishers in the hallway outside the Lightning locker room offering congratulations.
Tampa Bay had just beaten the Canadiens 3-1 Tuesday night in front of an announced crowd of 18,808 at the Tampa Bay Times Forum, so they expected people to be happy. But all the congratulations? "That usually doesn't happen after a win," they said.
But this win was special because with the Capitals regulation loss and Devils shootout loss, the Lightning (42-25-9) clinched a playoff spot.
"I had no idea," Cooper said. "I'm excited for what's happening. It's a really cool feeling."
Not only did Tampa Bay beat Montreal — its likely first-round opponent which, despite the loss, also clinched a playoff spot — one of Cooper's prized rookies, Tyler Johnson, scored the winner with a high backhand to finish a shorthanded breakaway that broke a 1-1 tie with 7:19 left in the third period.
It was Johnson's 23rd goal, tying captain Steven Stamkos' franchise rookie record.
Ryan Callahan's second-period, power-play goal tied the score at 1. Alex Killorn had an empty-netter and Ben Bishop made 25 saves for their 37th win.
"It's awesome," Bishop said of clinching Tampa Bay's first playoff spot since 2011. "It's a goal we set at the start of the season. It's something special."
"You want to win that Stanley Cup and now we have a chance. We're in the playoffs," Johnson said. "Once you're in anything can happen. We're trying to get some momentum, trying to build on it, trying to be ready for it and see where it takes us."
The team's attention now turns to home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
Tampa Bay likely will face Montreal as the second- and third-place teams in the Atlantic Division. Both have 93 points, though because it has played one fewer game the Lightning officially is ahead. If it can hold that spot, it will open the playoffs at the Times Forum.
Johnson's goal, their fifth shorthanded which tied the league lead, was started in the defensive zone by defenseman Victor Hedman, who forced David Desharnais to give up the puck.
Johnson gained the puck by lifting the stick of Thomas Vanek. They outraced Vanek and P.K. Subban. That left goalie Carey Price, who was outstanding with 30 saves.
"Price didn't think I could get it to my backhand, I don't think, so they tried to over-challenge there," Johnson said. "Luckily I was able to get there and try to get it up and I was able to find a way. It was huge."
"We're proud in here," Stamkos said. "It is an accomplishment but there still is a lot of hard work to be done."
"It's just a wave of emotions right now," Cooper said.
And a lot of congratulations.

Sources say retail magnate Fawaz Al Hokair is the lucky new owner of city's highest residence
The buyer of the sky-high $95 million penthouse at 432 Park Avenue is a Middle Eastern billionaire, The Real Deal has learned, with sources pointing to Saudi Arabian retail magnate Fawaz Al Hokair.
The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom pad in Macklowe Properties and CIM Group's trophy building entered contract in 2013 for north of $11,500 per square foot, but the buyer was not revealed at the time.
The 8,255-square-foot full-floor penthouse is the loftiest residential perch in the city. At 1,396 feet tall, 432 Park boasts Manhattan's tallest rooftop. The apartment features a wood-burning fireplace, heated bathroom floors and, of course, the building's signature 10-foot-by-10-foot windows.
Al Hokair is the founder and chairperson of Fawaz Alhokair Group, a $22 billion operation and Saudi Arabia's most valuable retail and real estate company, according to Forbes, which pegs their net worth at $1.37 billion. The conglomerate mainly focuses on retail franchising, with 2,100 stores across the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and the Caucasus region for brands including Topshop, Banana Republic, Zara and Gap.
Representatives for the building declined to comment, and the sales office did not respond.
When the deal closes, it will be New York City's second-priciest condo sale ever, after the $100.5 million deal for a penthouse at Extell Development's One57. The record was formerly held by the $88 million sale of a 15 Central Park West penthouse to fertilizer tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev's daughter, Ekaterina Rybolovleva.
Two other penthouses in 432 Park are currently on the market, for $81 million and $76.5 million. The building was once the most expensive residential project in the city, based on average asking price per square foot, but may be eclipsed by Vornado Realty Trust's 220 Central Park South.
Ohio State Highway Patrol officials are searching for the driver who struck and killed a bicyclist along a rural road in southeast Delaware County on Sunday afternoon.

TORONTO — At a quintessential Friday morning press conference at a bus terminal in Richmond Hill, Premier Kathleen Wynne announced they had spinelessly caved to their cabinet and caucus and reneged on a pledge to allow Toronto to toll the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway, for fear that their hot shambles of a government might lose votes among commuters in the 2018 election.
Sorry, I mean they announced she's a really excellent listener: “Any leader who doesn't listen to those voices, doesn't listen to the team, … isn't actually leading.”
Sorry again, I mean they announced tolls weren't appropriate because they had suddenly realized — since last month, when they said they would approve them — that there aren't enough alternatives for commuters. “Part of the fairness of decisions that we make has to be that people have choices. It has to be that whatever we do is more affordable, not less affordable for people,” they said.
I'm just going to pause here to note that the maximum toll anyone has thus far proposed, $5.20 a trip, is about twice as “affordable” as a GO train ride from Burlington to Union Station.
Oh hell, sorry a third time. I'm such a Douglas Downer. Wynne had good news! Beginning in 2019, Ontario municipalities will get a bigger share of the gas tax, doubling from two cents to four by 2022. That would likely net Toronto about $175 million annually — “the same money” as tolls would have brought in, Wynne said, to fund Toronto's giant list of much-needed transit and transportation projects.
In fact, there was no official estimate of what tolls might bring in. A very preliminary staff report suggested it could range from $166 million a year at $2 per trip to $336 million at $5.20. Indeed, the most basic questions remained to be answered: How quickly could tolls be implemented, and at what cost? Once the ever-increasing price of rebuilding the Gardiner was factored in, how much would be left over for sexier projects?
Crucially, however, these were the city's decisions to make. Toronto had hitched its wagon to a big, new, plausible and sustainable funding source over which it had maximum possible control.
“I think that it's important that they have the ability to raise the money to augment (provincial funding),” Wynne said way back in, uh, December. Now we'll have to make do with a promise of $175 million a year, in 2022, from a premier who's roughly as popular as athlete's foot. Roll out the barrel!
A source with knowledge of the discussions between Wynne and Tory in September says the premier told the mayor to “go for it” on tolls. “I canvassed with the premier and others in the Ontario government a whole host of other options,” they said — a liquor tax, which (like tolls) is specifically contemplated by the City of Toronto Act, and others that aren't, like a sales tax or a share of the HST. There was zero interest, they said.
“We are a global metropolis,” Tory thundered. “It is time that … I stop being treated as a little boy going up to Queen's Park in short pants to say ‘please, could you help me out'.” And if the Liberals are going to say no to everything, they ventured, then they have “an absolute obligation” to provide their own “predictable funding.”
It would seem the Liberals disagree. The premier's word is not bond, and by rights they won't be premier for much longer anyway. There's no love for tolls among their potential replacements: the Progressive Conservatives mount the same populist objections as the New Democrats. In a statement, Tory Leader Patrick Brown declared Friday's announcement “a big victory for commuters.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said municipalities should get the gas tax money sooner — so we've got that going for us, which is nice. But it's not all that much.
“We need more than ($175 million a year) to address $33 billion in unfunded projects that have been sitting around here for decades,” said Tory. “I don't intend to be the mayor who leaves city hall with that number having (risen).”
Well, that is going to take some doing. There are other revenue options that don't require provincial sign-off — a vehicle registration tax, a parking tax, property tax — but some are even more politically radioactive than tolls, and a smorgasbord of smaller ones might be a harder sell than one whopper. Tory showed courage in advocating tolls; that courage having vanished into the bottomless pit of Liberal cowardice and expediency, they may soon find themselves more or less back at square one.

Mark One Wolf appears in this video produced by the Washington Redskins.
A Indian featured by Washington Redskins in an ad campaign defending the team's controversial name may not be an Indian, according to Deadspin.
In a piece called “Is The Redskins' ‘VIP' Indian Defender A Fake Indian?,” sportswriter Dave McKenna detailed numerous allegations that Mark One Wolf Yancey, who has appeared at the Redskins' training camp wearing feathers and said they were an Apache, is not of Native American descent.
“We can't find anything about them that's native, and we've had a lot of people look into this,” Jacqueline Keeler, an Oregon writer and activist against native mascots, told McKenna.
“For all that they say they are, there is not one single tribe that claims him,” said Eugene Herrod of the Southern California Indian Center, who researched the Yancey family. “Nobody knows who they are,” they told McKenna. “Everything we've found about them and their parents indicates that they identify as African American. As far as I can tell, I think he's read a lot about Indians, but that doesn't make them an Indian.”
Yancey's many pseudonyms in public records and on the Internet — which include “Mark Suzuki,” “Mark Yan,” “Kram Yecnay,” “Mark One Wolf,” “Mark Yazzie” and “Dalaa Ba'Cho” — as well as their ambiguous tribal affiliation cast further doubt on their identity.
In an interview with McKenna, Yancey explained why they didn't feel it necessary to prove they are an Indian with a DNA test or a blood test:
“If an Asian person says I'm Japanese, nobody asks them to prove it,” Yancey says. “If I said I was Puerto Rican nobody would say: ‘Oh, really? Then where did you grow up?' If you say you're white, people won't ask for your white man's card. The only ethnicity that's required to have an identification card is Native American. I never confirm or deny any tribal membership because it is not relevant. I don't get into blood quantum, either, because that's a colonial mindset. I've never looked into my blood quantum, so I don't know what it [would tell]. I have always been a Chiricahua Apache, and the only reason I know that is because that's what my family told me. Your grandmother tells you something, you're going to believe it.”
McKenna, who has written for The Washington Post, has tussled with the Redskins before. Redskins owner Dan Snyder sued Washington City Paper and McKenna for defamation in 2011 over an unflattering piece, “The Cranky Redskins Fan's Guide to Dan Snyder.” The suit was dropped later that year.
Yancey has been an outspoken advocate for the Washington football team as columnists and advocates pressure Snyder to change its name. Founder of Native American Redskins Fans, they have called for a boycott of The Washington Post over its editorial board's decision not to use the team's name.
“Washington Post we are silenced no more, hear us now,” the organization wrote, as reported by the fan Web site httr4life. “You have now been Boycotted for your injustice. As Native Americans, Redskins fans and supporters we feel that your post has unjustly ignored those of us who support the Redskins name. We feel the Redskins name represents our Native American community in a very positive, and honorable light.”
The Redskins have put Native Americans with questionable credentials in the spotlight before. Last year, an alleged chief who appeared on the show “Redskins Nation,” produced by the team, was not a chief, and probably not Native American, as UPI reported.

Spring has finally arrived! Thank goodness. I wasn't sure I could take one more day of winter. With the return of Spring came Daylights Saving. I awoke Sunday morning thinking I actually slept in for once. I jumped out of bed ecstatic only to realize my phone automatic “sprung forward,” and I had in fact not slept in at all but actually woke up early. I could only stay mad at the trickery for so long since the sun shined until past 7pm! As a food blogger, it is amazing to be able to come home from work, cook dinner then shoot photos in a natural lit apartment.

Monks began to protest on the streets of Lhasa earlier this week
One eyewitness told the BBC how large groups of people were setting fire to cars and shops and destroying anything of Chinese influence.
The US embassy in Beijing said US citizens had reported hearing gunfire.
Rallies have continued all week in what are thought to be the largest protests against Beijing's rule in 20 years.
Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, released a statement expressing deep concern, saying the protests were a "manifestation of the deep-rooted resentment of the Tibetan people".
The Dalai Lama, who heads Tibet's government-in-exile in India, called on the Chinese leadership to stop using force and begin dialogue with the Tibetan people.
They also urged Tibetans not to resort to violence.
"As I have always said, unity and stability under brute force is at best a temporary solution. It is unrealistic to expect unity and stability under such a rule," the statement said.
Tear gas
The US-based International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) said at least one police car had been set on fire on Friday.
ICT spokesperson Kate Saunders said their group had received reports that the Tromsikhang market in Barkhor Street - a busy commercial neighbourhood - was either on fire or had burnt down.
TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet always part of its territory But Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century In 1950, China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India
Quick guide: Tibet India detains Tibetans Eyewitness: Monks protest
"It seems that lay people have now become involved in the protests," they said.
An eyewitness told the BBC there was a thick pall of smoke hanging over the city.
Another eyewitness said security forces and monks had clashed on Wednesday and several monks were beaten.
They said about 300 monks had tried to leave the Sera monastery to protest but security forces brandishing clubs stopped them and at least one monk was beaten to the ground.
The protests began earlier this week, when a number of monks were reportedly arrested after a march marking the 49th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule.
Hundreds of monks took to the streets to demand their release - and reports say tear gas was used to disperse them.
The police were reported to have sealed off the city's three main monasteries on Thursday.
Correspondents say there is growing evidence that protests against Chinese rule are intensifying, despite assurances by Beijing on Thursday that the situation was under control.
China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, though Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before the twentieth century, and many Tibetans remain loyal to the Dalai Lama, who fled in 1959 and currently lives in exile in India.

Which American states convict the most corrupt officials
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
ROD BLAGOJEVICH, a former governor of Illinois, begins their 14-year prison sentence on Thursday March 15th. They were convicted last year of bribery, wire fraud and trying to sell a Senate seat.  They are the fourth governor of Illinois out of the last seven to be convicted, and adds to the 1,828 public corruption convictions the state saw between 1976 and 2010. A report by the University of Illinois at Chicago estimates that corruption costs the state more than $500m a year. Two states had even higher numbers of appointees, government employees (and a few private individuals) convicted of public corruption: New York, with 2,522 convictions and California with 2,345 convictions. Of the largest states though, Illinois had the highest per-person conviction rate, at 1.4 per 10,000 population. With little over 600,000 residents, the District of Columbia had a rate of nearly 17. This is partly because the Justice Department and other federal agencies with headquarters in DC try some corruption cases there irrespective of where the offence took place.
The ridicule has trailed them for years, in out-of-town gyms and on the NBA's snarkiest message boards. Perhaps no player has been mocked more than Monta Ellis. They shoot too much; they have never met a jumper they didn't like; he's a ball hog; he's a volume shooter with an efficiency problem. I myself have been guilty of casting such aspersions. Well, although the samples are small, and the fresh season has just begun, Ellis might be rewriting their own story and teaching basketball analysts a very important lesson in the process.
What if Ellis has a great year? Do we suddenly forget all that derision? Do we ignore all the words that writers have spilled since 2005 decrying them as a foolish player? Maybe we pat them on the back, call them the “Kia Most Improved Player,” and move on? I'm not sure, but through five games, Ellis looks like a different player, and if this keeps up — and I hope it does — I think it has the potential to present a scathing indictment on the state of NBA analytics.
One thing that supposedly separates good and bad in the NBA is shot selection; good teams and good players take good shots, bad teams and bad players take bad shots. But while that's true, the underlying origins of those behaviors are too often overlooked. The best offenses are capable of creating open looks on a regular basis. Good “shot selection” begins with good shot creation.
During the 2013 NBA Finals it seemed like Danny Green was wide open all the time. They set the record for 3s made in the Finals by the middle of Game 5. For years, Gregg Popovich and their Spurs have done a marvelous job designing coordinated sequences of actions punctuated by an open player catching and shooting the ball from a good spot on the floor. Bad teams don't do that, and as a result, players on those teams don't get as many wide-open looks. Remember when Cleveland released the exact same Danny Green a few years ago? I guess they just couldn't shoot back then.
A vast majority of NBA possessions end with some kind of field goal attempt, but these shots often look differently in San Antonio and Miami than they do in Charlotte. Simply put, the league's least-efficient offenses lose to their opponents' defenses more frequently; these losses are commonly marked by a so-called bad or difficult shot attempt, and as a result, shooters on these teams never put up efficient numbers. Still, the bookkeepers of our beloved team sport remain happy to assign and assess things like field goal percentage, assists, and Player Efficiency Rating to individual players regardless of context.
Ellis has never really played for a good team. But he's in Dallas now, and they suddenly find themselves playing for Rick Carlisle and alongside talented veterans like Dirk Nowitzki, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion, and Jose Calderon. Their PER is the highest it has ever been, and through the first week of the season it looks like Ellis is a new player — but he's not. The inconvenient truth for analysts is that he's the exact same human being just splashed into an extremely different, and much more efficient, ecosystem.
Through five games, Ellis has numbers that would be the envy of almost any other guard in the league.  They are averaging 24 points per game, while making 52 percent of their shots.  They are taking more than seven free throws per game, by far the highest mark of their career, which serves as a clear sign that they are being very aggressive. Last night, the old-fashioned player trackers over at Synergy put out this bat signal:
Monta Ellis is creating 24 points per-game on the pick and roll this season, the most is the NBA this season by a significant margin. — mySynergySports (@mySynergySports) November 7, 2013
One of two things is happening: Either Ellis is the breakout star of small-sample-size theater this year and a regression is coming, or they are in the process of demonstrating something that seems so obvious I hesitate to even write it: Playing for a good team makes individual players appear better, while playing for a bad team makes them look worse. To this point, even our most advanced stats neglect that most basic notion of basketball ecology.
I'm not saying Ellis will undoubtedly be great this year, but it will be absolutely fascinating if they are.
Until this month, Ellis, on most counts, was a laughable jump shooter with a bad volume habit — one of the league's princes of silly jumpers. But maybe we need to consider how they became bad shot royalty. It seems clear that there are dozens of potentially productive players in the league who are currently struggling within mediocre systems and would exhibit drastic “improvements” the minute they got to play in better situations. The fact that many of these same players are maligned is troubling.
A few decades ago baseball sabermetrics had its revolution in part because analysts realized the game was only technically a team sport, and that it was more aptly dissected as a sequence of outcomes that involve sovereign performers competing in one-on-one encounters. But basketball exhibits the exact opposite nature and is in desperate need of a very different kind of analytical revolution. Unlike home runs or strikeouts, almost every basket, made or missed, in the NBA is the product of teamwork — coordinated and connected actions by multiple actors behaving (or in some cases, attempting to behave) as a unit. As a result, every basketball analysis that fails to account for the natural ecology of the game is inherently flawed — and to this point, almost all “advanced” analyses make no such ecological considerations.
There's no way to accurately characterize an individual basketball player without considering their situational habitat. Yet this is what we all do on a daily basis. We constantly cite individual basketball stats like points, field goal percentage, and assists as if they were home runs. I am as guilty as anyone. Ellis's shot chart from last season is horrible, there's no doubt about that — but what does that actually tell us? It tells us they were very active and their shots from the field went in at below-average rates, which is true, but that's not the whole truth. Part of the problem is that our spreadsheets can't handle the truth.
Don't get me wrong, Ellis has taken hundreds of ill-advised shots during their career, but some of them are the result of their environment. When you are a quick, creative shooter on a team that lacks offensive firepower, guess who has to generate field goal attempts from scratch? Guess who they pass the ball to at the end of the shot clock?
More than any other major American sport, the NBA is all about individual players. “Jordan! Malone! It's the NBA Finals on NBC!” As such, it is very tempting to construct an accounting framework that spews out cheap factoids, mimics that marketing blueprint, and feeds our endless fascination with individual players. However, as Ellis is threatening to tell us, that kind of approach is dangerously simple, and we should be wary of bestowing the accomplishments or failings of an entire ecosystem on one of its member species.
Gov. Kate Brown's new gun proposal will ban extended-capacity magazines, ban sales to people ineligible of buying guns and expand the relationships that qualify under "domestic violence."
JACKSON COUNTY, ORE. - Governor Kate Brown had a big day on Friday. Brown announced a new executive order, proposed new legislation and called on Congress to make gun law changes.
Brown's new executive order gives Oregon State Police and local authorities more tools to track and analyze gun transactions, creates a new work group to review gun-related domestic violence cases and directs the Oregon Health Authority to report annually on gun violence and its effect on public health.
They proposed a new bill that would redefine the relationships that qualify for "domestic violence," ban extended-capacity magazines and limit the ability for somebody to buy a gun who cannot get approved for the sale of one.
Brown also called on Congress to ban assault weapons and ban the sale of guns to people who are on the FBI's watchlist.
Guns R Us owner, Jonathan Purtzer, supports Brown's idea to limit gun violence but believes they are going about it the wrong way. They believe reducing the sales of guns is not the solution. Purtzer believes when mentally handicapped and generally bad people use guns, the people are the problem, not the guns.
Facebook.com/HelpFindKatelinAkens Katelin Akens has not been seen since Dec. 5, 2015.
Authorities are seeking clues in the disappearance of Katelin Akens, a 19-year-old woman who vanished en route to a Virginia airport, leaving their fiancée and family with no idea of them fate.
"It bothers everybody," Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office Captain Jeff Pearce told The Huffington Post. "We just want to know what happened."
According to the sheriff's office, Akens' stepfather was driving them to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Dec. 5, when the teen asked to be dropped off at the Springfield mall. They reportedly planned to take the metro from the Franconia-Springfield stop near the mall to the airport.
Later that day, Akens' mother received a text message from their daughter.
"She texted and said they made it there, but we don't know if that's true," their mother, Lisa Sullivan, told Richmond's WTVR‑TV.
Facebook.com/HelpFindKatelinAkens Katelin Akens has piercings in their ears, nostril, right lower lip and tongue. They may be wearing glasses.
Akens' fiancée, Amber Rios, had been living with Akens since 2014 in Arizona. Rios also reportedly received a text message from Akens saying something came up and they were not returning that day.
"She flew out there on the first and they were supposed to come back here on the fifth," Rios told Richmond's WWBT News. "Her sister just had a baby, so they were going out there to meet them nephew."
Akens never boarded their flight in Virginia, and investigators have been unable to confirm the teen was ever at the mall, as the area where their stepfather said they dropped them off is reportedly not covered by surveillance cameras. Authorities also have yet to determine if the teen ever made it to the metro or to the airport.
Pearce described Akens' stepfather as "absolutely" cooperative in the investigation and said they are not considered a suspect or person of interest in their stepdaughter's disappearance.
Two days after Akens disappeared, their luggage was found discarded in a drainage ditch in Spotsylvania County near the Fredericksburg city limit, which is roughly 50 miles from the airport. The teen's wallet, identification and phone charger were reportedly among the items found in their unopened luggage container.
Facebook.com/HelpFindKatelinAkens "You don't know what to think," Katelin Akens' mother, Lisa Sullivan, told Richmond's WRIC-TV. "Where is she?"
"It's scary," Sullivan told Richmond's WRIC‑TV after the discovery. "You don't know what to think. Where is she?"
Police say they have no tangible clues to Akens' whereabouts, and they will not speculate as to what might have happened to them
"We have absolutely no indication at this point if anything happened, and if it did, what or where it happened," Pearce told HuffPost.
Pearce also declined to say if Akens' Facebook page, which authorities accessed after obtaining a warrant for it, revealed any clues.
The affidavit for the search warrant has been sealed by a judge, according to The Free Lance-Star.
"The information deputies and the detectives have uncovered is not something we're going to be able to release at this point," Pearce said.
Facebook.com/HelpFindKatelinAkens Katelin Akens has two distinguishable tattoos on their body.
For now, there appear to be more questions than answers in the teen's mysterious disappearance.
"At some point I'm sure we will have an answer, but we just don't have any indication at this point," Pearce said. "We do still have an active open case on it and a detective that is assigned to it. Every week he's trying to find some new way of seeing if we can identify where they might be. A lot of it is going to depend on folks coming forward and giving us tips and clues."
Katelin Akens is described as 5 feet, 4 inches tall and 122 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. They have butterflies tattooed on their left forearm and stars on their right foot.
Anyone with information about their disappearance is asked to contact the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office at 540-582-7115 or Spotsylvania Crime Solvers at 1-800-928-5822. For more information, visit Help find Katelin Akens on Facebook.

The Great Riots of New York
by Joel Tyler Headley (1873)
The institution of a draft during the Civil War caused widespread resentment throughout the North, leading to a number of violent protests in 1863, particularly in New York. Many working-class Irish immigrants in New York pointed to the fact that the rich could buy their way out the draft, but also turned their anger against black people, seeing the war as a war against slavery in which poor whites were dying. They blamed blacks for their own misery, especially when blacks, desperate for work themselves, were used as strikebreakers. On July 13, 1863, a number of draft resisters burned down a New York City draft office, setting off four days of violence, most of it targeted against blacks. In this account of the riots1, historian Joel Tyler Headley describes some of the genuine grievances of the Northern draft resisters, but also reveals their fears of sweeping change. From Voices of A People's History, edited by Zinn and Arnove
Meanwhile, events were assuming an alarming aspect in the western part of the city. Early in the morning men began to assemble here in separate groups, as if in accordance with a previous arrangement, and at last moved quietly north along the various avenues. Women, also, like camp followers, took the same direction in crowds. They were thus divided into separate gangs, apparently to take each avenue in their progress, and make a clean sweep. The factories and workshops were visited, and the men compelled to knock off work and join them, while the proprietors were threatened with the destruction of their property, if they made any opposition. The separate crowds were thus swelled at almost every step, and armed with sacks, and clubs, and every conceivable weapon they could lay hands on, they moved north towards some point which had evidently been selected as a place of rendezvous. This proved to be a vacant lot near Central Park, and soon the living screams began to flow into it, and a more wild, savage, and heterogeneous-looking mass could not be imagined. After a short consultation they again took up the line of march, and in two separate bodies, moved down Fifth and Sixth Avenues, until they reached Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh Streets, when they turned directly east.
The number composing this first mob has been so differently estimated, that it would be impossible from reports merely, to approximate the truth. A pretty accurate idea, however, can be gained of its immense size, from a statement made by Mr. King, son of President [Charles] King, of Columbia College. Struck by its magnitude, they had the curiosity to get some estimate of it by timing its progress, and they found that although it filled the broad street from curbstone to curbstone, and was moving rapidly, it took between twenty and twenty-five minutes for it to pass a single point.
A ragged, coatless, heterogeneously weaponed army, it heaved tumultuously along toward Third Avenue. Tearing down the telegraph poles as it crossed the Harlem and New Haven Railroad track, it surged angrily up around the building where the drafting was going on. The small squad of police stationed there to repress disorder looked on bewildered, feeling they were powerless in the presence of such a host. Soon a stone went crashing through a window, which was the signal for a general assault on the doors. These giving way before the immense pressure, the foremost rushed in, followed by shouts and yells from those behind, and began to break up the furniture. The drafting officers, in an adjoining room, alarmed, fled precipitately through the rear of the building. The mob seized the wheel in which were the names, and what books, papers, and lists were left, and tore them up, and scattered them in every direction. A safe stood on one side, which was supposed to contain important papers, and on this they fell with clubs and stones, but in vain. Enraged at being thwarted, they set fire to the building, and hurried out of it. As the smoke began to ascend, the onlooking multitude without sent up a loud cheer. Though the upper part of the building was occupied by families, the rioters, thinking that the officers were concealed there, rained stones and brick-bats against the windows, sending terror into the hearts of the inmates. Deputy Provost Marshal Vanderpoel, who had mingled in the crowd, fearing for the lives of the women and children, boldly stepped to the front, and tried to appease the mob, telling them the papers were all destroyed, and begged them to fall back, and let others help the inmates of the building, or take hold themselves. The reply was a heavy blow in the face. Vanderpoel shoved the man who gave it aside, when they were assailed with a shower of blows and curses. Fearing for their life, they broke through the crowd, and hastened to the spot where the police were standing, wholly powerless in the midst of this vast, excited throng.
In the meantime, the flames, unarrested, made rapid way, and communicating to the adjoining building, set it on fire. The volumes of smoke, rolling heavenward, and the crackling and roaring of the flames, seemed for a moment to awe the mob, and it looked silently on the ravaging of a power more terrible and destructive than its own.
At this time Superintendent [of Police John A.] Kennedy was quietly making their way across the town toward the office of the provost marshal, [Marshal] Jenkins. But noticing a fire as they approached, they left their wagon at the corner of Forty-sixth Street and Lexington Avenue, and walked over toward Third Avenue. The street was blocked with people, but they seemed quiet and orderly as any gathering in presence of a fire, and differed from it only in that the countenances of all seemed to wear a pleased, gratified look. As they unsuspiciously edged their way forward toward the fire, they heard some one cry out, "There's Kennedy!" "Which is him?" asked a second; and they were pointed out.
Kennedy was dressed in ordinary citizen's clothes, and carried only a slight bamboo cane. Thinking the allusion to them was prompted only by curiosity, they kept on, when suddenly they felt themselves violently pushed against. Turning around, they encountered a man in a soldier's old uniform, and sternly demanded what they meant by that. The words had hardly escaped their lips, when a heavy blow was planted full in their face. Instantly the crowd closed around him, and rained blows in rapid succession on him, until they fell over and down the graded street, some six feet, into a vacant lot. The crowd, with yells, poured after him. Kennedy, springing to their feet, started on a run across the lot towards Forty-seventh Street, distancing their pursuers. But as they reached Forty-seventh Street, and attempted to ascend the embankment, another crowd, which had witnessed the pursuit, rushed upon him, and knocked them back again in front of their pursuers. They quickly sprang up, though bleeding and stunned, for they knew their only chance for life was in keeping their feet. But the crowd closing around on both sides gave them no chance to run. One huge fellow, armed with a heavy club, endeavored to break in their skull, but Kennedy dodged their blows. Careful only for their head, they let them beat their body, while they made desperate efforts to break through the mass, whose demoniacal yells and oaths showed that they intended to take their life. In the struggle the whole crowd, swaying to and fro, slowly advanced toward Lexington Avenue, coming, as they did so, upon a wide mud-hole. "Drown him! drown him!" arose at once on every side, and the next moment a heavy blow, planted under their ear, sent them headforemost into the water.
Falling with their face amid the stones, they were kicked and trampled on, and pounded, till they were a mass of gore. Still struggling desperately for life, they managed to get to their feet again, and made a dash for the middle of the pond. The water was deep, and their murderers, disliking getting wet, did not follow him, but ran around to the other side, to meet them as they came out. But Kennedy was ahead of them, and springing up the bank into Lexington Avenue, saw a man whom they knew, and called out: "John Eagan, come here and save my life!" Mr. Eagan, who was a well-known and influential resident of that vicinity, immediately rushed forward to their assistance, and arrested their pursuers. Bur the Superintendent was so terribly bruised and mangled, that Eagan did not recognize him. He, however, succeeded in keeping the mob back, who, seeing the horrible condition their victim was in, doubtless thought they had finished him. Other citizens now coming forward, a passing feed wagon was secured, into which Kennedy was lifted, and driven to police headquarters. Acton, who was in the street as the wagon approached, saw the mangled body within, but did not dream who it was. The driver inquired where they should take him. "Around to the [police] station," carelessly replied Acton. The driver hesitated, and inquired again, "Where to?" Acton, supposing it was some drunkard, bruised in a brawl, replied rather petulantly, "Around to the station." The man then told them it was Kennedy. Acton, scanning the features more closely, saw that it indeed was the Superintendent themselves in this horrible condition. As the officers gathered around the bleeding, almost unconscious form, a murmur of wrath was heard, a sure premonition what work would be done when the hour of vengeance should come.

A new wind farm between Thorney and Parson Drove is to become fully operational this month.
British renewable energy company RES began construction of Wryde Croft Wind Farm in September 2014, and the 13 100 metre-high turbines were delivered in June 2015.
The construction of the turbines has seen family-owned R G Carter, of Padholme Road East, awarded the main construction contract which was valued at £5 million.
And during the main construction phase, 15 people were employed on the wind farm, including 20-year-old Callum Brooks, while Robert Read from Whittlesey won the contract to provide plant machinery and undertake earthworks, trenching and cabling on the site.
The wind farm will be capable of generating sufficient renewable electricity to power more than 13,000 average UK homes.

China handed over 330 pieces of office equipment including laptops, computers, scanners, printers and projectors to Pakistan's parliament yesterday.
The handover ceremony was held at the premises of the parliament in the capital Islamabad. Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong and Pakistani Senate Secretary Amjed Pervez Malik signed a handover document on behalf of their respective sides.
Pakistani Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani expressed gratitude for China's donation at the ceremony attended also by senators, parliamentarians and other high officials.
Rabbani said the donation will help improve the working conditions of the Pakistani parliament, highlighting the friendship and exchanges between the two countries and two peoples.
The Chinese ambassador said enhancing bilateral exchanges is of great importance to deepen the mutually beneficial cooperation, especially to promote the bilateral policy coordination and people-to-people exchanges.
Sun expressed the hope that the two sides continue making joint efforts to push for the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor so as to better benefit the people of the two countries.
No matter how many times you tell Norm Coleman's legal team that it's generally illegal to sign somebody else's name on a legal document, they're just not giving up on it.
Coleman lawyer Joe Friedberg is going over rejected ballots one by one with Dakota County elections manager Kevin Boyle. And again we've come to the matter of a fake signature on an absentee ballot application — though at least this time the person signing the name was admitting it up front.
A voter's mother signed their name to the absentee application, writing “mother” right next to it in parentheses. Thus the signature on the ballot envelope itself — possibly the voter's — didn't match the one of the application. Friedberg couldn't let it go:
Friedberg: Now, is it your position that if somebody signs the application with the permission of the voter, that does not make it a lawful application, or it does make it a lawful application? Boyle: In the case of the regular absentee ballot applications, we would need the mark or the signature of the applicant, not the applicant's mother. Friedberg: Is that because you would need it to compare to the voter's signature on the ballot, on the envelope? Boyle: That's one of the reasons.
At this point Friedberg quietly moved on to the next ballot in their stack.
It could have been worse. A while ago, Friedberg was declaring that they didn't care about the rules forbidding this.
Data gathered by smartphone sensors can be used to identify you, pinpoint your location and monitor your phone, irrespective of your privacy settings, new research has found.
Accelerometers, sensors used to track movement of smartphones, are used in countless apps, including pedometers, playing games and monitoring sleep. Research from the University of Illinois' Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering found that minuscule imperfections during the manufacturing process create a unique 'fingerprint' on the generated data.
The gathered data can be used to identify you as it is sent to the cloud for processing, bypassing privacy settings concerning the withholding of location data and with no need to discern your phone number or SIM card number, leaving you potentially vulnerable to cyberattack.
“Just by looking at the data, we can tell you which device it's coming from. It's almost like another identifier," said graduate student Nirupam Roy, who worked on the project. “Even if you erase the app in the phone, or even erase and reinstall all software, the fingerprint still stays inherent. That's a serious threat.”
There are no regulations mandating consent regarding data generated by accelerometers, and the research team believe other sensors in the phone, including cameras, microphones and gyroscopes, could process the same kind of information.
Deliberately injecting white noise in the sensor data can smudge the fingerprint, but such noise can also affect the operation of the application, making your pedometer inaccurate and functionally useless.
The researchers tested more than 100 devices over the course of nine months: 80 standalone accelerometer chips used in popular smartphones, 25 Android phones, and two tablets.
“Imagine that your right hand fingerprint, by some chance, matches with mine,” Associate Professor Romit Roy Choudhury said. “But your left-hand fingerprint also matching with mine is extremely unlikely. So even if accelerometers don't have unique fingerprints across millions of devices, we believe that by combining with other sensors such as the gyroscope, it might still be possible to track a particular device over time and space.”
Graduate student Sanorita Dey said you can best protect yourself and your device by not sharing your accelerometer data without thinking about how legitimate or how secure that application is.
“Even if it's using only the sensor data, still it can attack you in some way," they said. "The consumer should be aware.”

It's unlikely that ESPN's Chris Mortensen was going to out the source(s) of the blatantly false report from January that 11 of 12 Patriots footballs were a full two pounds under the 12.5 PSI minimum during a Friday appearance on WEEI. (That likelihood became even smaller once Mortensen canceled.)
John Dennis of WEEI reports, via Tom Curran of CSNNE.com, that one of Mortensen's “main sources” for the false report was NFL V.P. of game operations Mike Kensil.
Curran reported more than six months ago that Kensil, a former Jets employee whose father once was the team's president, was the “driving force” behind the investigation.
During a Thursday appearance on WEEI, Adam Schefter of ESPN seemed to suggest that Mortensen had multiple sources. Regardless of the total number, the information was false — and the report caused #DeflateGate to morph from a curiosity to, eventually, a federal case.
Before it became a federal case, it became a supposedly independent investigation. However independent the investigation was (or wasn't), it wasn't sufficiently independent to prompt Ted Wells to turn the focus back against the league for its potentially dissemination of false information to ESPN — and for its failure to immediately correct the information.
Image caption An "errant" apostrophe in a Devon shop window sign
The apostrophe is being banned from street names in parts of Devon to "avoid potential confusion".
Mid Devon District Council said its new streets had not contained apostrophes for many years, but the policy was now being made official.
It said apostrophes could only be found in three street names in the district.
It added that Beck's Square and Blundell's Avenue, both in Tiverton, and St George's Well in Cullompton, were "all named many, many years ago".
Andrew Lacey, from the council, said there was "no national guidance that stops apostrophes being used".
But proofreader Mary de Vere Taylor from Ashburton said the thought of apostrophes being removed made them "shudder".
"It's almost as though somebody with a giant eraser is literally trying to erase punctuation from our consciousness," they told BBC News.
Image caption Bakers View in Newton Abbot is named after Sir Samuel White Baker
They said there was something "terribly British and terribly reassuring" about well-written and well-punctuated writing.
"Some may say I should get a life and get out more, but if I got out more and saw place names with no apostrophes where there should be, I shudder to think how I'd react," they added.
Some rules about apostrophes... To indicate missing letters or shortened words - it's [it is]; can't [cannot], should've [should have]
To show possession - Mark's house; this season's chinos
To show possession when a plural noun ends with the letter s, an apostrophe is added after it - Pete goes to a boys' club; Kate teaches at a girls' school
But when a plural noun does not end in an s, the apostrophe comes before it - Eileen went to the children's library; James sang in a men's choir Think you know your apostrophes? Test yourself here
Ms de Vere Taylor said while they accepted language had to evolve, in their opinion the council's decision was a backward step.
In Newton Abbot, residents of Bakers Views - named after writer and explorer Sir Samuel White Baker - have differing opinions over whether their street sign should have an apostrophe.
"I think it probably should, if we're being completely correct, because it's named after the chap who funded Baker's Park just down the hill - because it's a view of their park," one resident said.
But another said: "I've never thought about it and it doesn't worry me at all."
Devon greengrocer Jim Ashford said although their English grammar was "not brilliant", they try to ensure their fruit and vegetable signs are properly punctuated.
"The apostrophe is part of the English language so I think it should be upheld," they said.
Steve Jenner, from the Plain English Campaign, said punctuation, including the apostrophe, was one of the basic rules of language and they described the council's decision as "nonsensical".
A statement from the council said: "Our proposed policy on street naming and numbering covers a whole host of practical issues, many of which are aimed at reducing potential confusion over street names."
However, it declined to comment further and did not elaborate on who might be confused by the use of correct punctuation.
Dr Rowan Williams said that the Church of England had a “proper interest in the ethics of the financial world” and warned that there had been “little visible change in banking practices” following the recession.
They urged David Cameron and George Osborne to drop their opposition to a European-wide tax on financial transactions, which is expected to be formally proposed by France and Germany at the G20 summit of world leaders starting tomorrow.
“The demands of the protesters have been vague. Many people are frustrated beyond measure at what they see as the disastrous effects of global capitalism; but it isn't easy to say what we should do differently. It is time we tried to be more specific,” Dr Williams said.
The archbishop's intervention came after the Church and the City of London Corporation agreed to suspend plans to evict protesters who have been camped on the doorstep of St Paul's for more than two weeks. The issue has caused deep divisions within the Church and led to the resignation of three members of St Paul's clergy.
The archbishop said the rows over the handling of the demonstration had risked “forgetting the substantive questions that prompted the protest”. “The protest at St Paul's was seen by an unexpectedly large number of people as the expression of a widespread and deep exasperation with the financial establishment that shows no sign of diminishing,” Dr Williams said.
“There is still a powerful sense around – fair or not – of a whole society paying for the errors and irresponsibility of bankers; of impatience with a return to 'business as usual' – represented by still-soaring bonuses and little visible change in banking practices.” They added: “The best outcome from the unhappy controversies at St Paul's will be if the issues raised… can focus a concerted effort to move the debate on and effect credible change in the financial world.”
The archbishop said they supported the main proposals of a recent report from the Vatican calling for widespread financial reform.
The central recommendation is for a financial transaction tax – known as the “Tobin tax” after the economist who developed the idea – levied on the sale of shares, bonds and foreign currency. It would be expected to raise billions of pounds that could be spent in the developing world.
The archbishop said: “This has won the backing of significant experts who cannot be written off as naive anti-capitalists – George Soros, Bill Gates and many others. It is gaining traction among European nations, with a strong statement in support this week from Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister.
“The objections made by some who claim it would mean a substantial drop in employment and in the economy generally seem to rest on exaggerated and sharply challenged projections – and, more important, ignore the potential of such a tax to stabilise currency markets in a way to boost rather than damage the real economy.”
The issue of the Tobin tax is expected to be on the agenda at the G20 summit in Cannes, with European countries considering introducing the levy to help fund the single currency rescue package.
Mr Osborne, the Chancellor, has said that they would only support the introduction of the tax on a global basis, because financial trading would simply move from London to other markets such as New York and Singapore. American and Asian governments are thought to be opposed to the levy. Government sources declined to comment on the archbishop's intervention last night. Dr Williams also called for wider controls on banks, saying they should be compelled to help “reinvigorate” the economy and not put the public's savings at risk.
Writing in today's Financial Times, the archbishop says: “The rolling-up of individual and small-scale savings into high-risk and high-return adventures in the virtual economy is one of the more obvious danger areas. Early government action in this area is needed. A second plea is to recapitalise banks with public money. Banks should be obliged in return to help reinvigorate the real economy.”
They concluded: “These ideas, which have been advanced from other quarters, religious and secular, in recent years, do not amount to a simplistic call for the end of capitalism, but they are far more than a general expression of discontent.
“If we want to take seriously the moral agenda of the protesters at St Paul's, these are some of the ways in which we should be taking it forward.”
The archbishop spoke out on a day in which senior bankers appeared in Parliament to defend their actions. Stephen Hester, the chief executive of RBS, said that bonuses paid to staff were “not the fount of all evils”. Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays, said that banks “can't be told to increase lending and capital at the same time” but backed the need for “strong regulation”.
Dr Williams's article is their latest in a series of interventions in politics. Earlier this year, they warned that the public was gripped with fear over some government reforms and said that the Coalition lacked democratic legitimacy. Yesterday, it emerged that the St Paul's protesters would almost certainly still be in position during next week's Remembrance Sunday service and probably in the run-up to Christmas. Police had been expected to start attempting to move them on this week.
Following a meeting between senior figures at St Paul's and the Rt Rev Dr Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, the authorities decided to abandon their eviction plans.
The bishop effectively told the Corporation of London that the Church would not sanction evictions on Church land, by saying: “The Chapter recognises the Corporation's right to take such action on Corporation land.”
They added: “The alarm bells are ringing all over the world. St Paul's has now heard that call. Today's decision means that the doors are most emphatically open to engage with matters concerning not only those encamped around the cathedral but millions of others in this country and around the globe.”
The cathedral asked Ken Costa, 62, an investment banker and Conservative Party donor, to draw up a plan to “reconnect the financial with the ethical”, and also gave a voluntary role to the Rev Dr Giles Fraser, the cathedral's former Canon Chancellor, who resigned last week.
A lawsuit filed in King County Thursday says the Seventh Day Adventists ignored years of warnings about a pedophile teacher who taught at the church's small, private schools in California and Washington.
Douglas “John” Allison was the principal. They were one of only two teachers at Mountain View Christian School in Sequim.
Allison was arrested last year for sexually assaulting two 10-year-olds under their desk in the classroom while the other children were distracted watching movies, according to police reports and the lawsuit.
Allison is now serving a 26-year prison sentence.
The lawsuit, filed by The Davis Law Group of Seattle, includes records showing the Seventh Day Adventists received a complaint about Allison as early as December of 2014.
A document from the Del Norte Department of Health and Human Services in Crescent City California reads, “The Reporting Party (RP) stated ____'s teacher Doug Allison at Seventh Day Adventist School put their hand down the front of their pants on many occasions.” It's unclear what, if any, investigations followed the California complaints.
The suit says church leaders in California and Washington also received multiple reports from parents concerns about Allison's hugging and touching students.
Spokesperson Heidi Baumgartner for the Western Washington Corporation of the Seventh Day Adventists said, “We have not seen a lawsuit filing yet, and cannot make a comment at this time.”
The Davis Law Group says the victim's family has declined to speak publicly about the case and is asking for privacy.

Planning a trip to one of the Universal Studios parks in Orlando, Hollywood, or Japan soon? You might want to hold off on it for a year or two if you're a Nintendo fan. The Big N put out a press release this morning announcing that they've teamed up wtih Universal to “bring the fun of Nintendo to life with expansive, highly themed environments at Osaka, Orlando, and Hollywood.” If you've seen how well Orlando has handled licensed theme areas in their parks in the past, this has to be exciting news.
The press release promises gigantic prianha plants springing to life while visitors are surrounded by question blocks, power-ups, and more. Nintendo's creative types are working with Universal to bring the characters, action, and fun experience that Nintendo is world famous for to life, right in their parks.
The experience will be, “expansive, immersive, and interactive” with “highly themed and authentic environments” and “multiple attractions, shops, and restaurants.”
The press release notes that no timetable has been established, but that planning and creative work for these new attractions is already underway. Each of the three Universal parks will open their Nintendo-themed attractions “separately over the next several years.” Specifics of each Nintendo-themed park area will be announced soon.
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump at the second presidential debate October 9, 2016. AP The vast chasm separating one side of the electorate from the other right now may make it feel like America's divisions are impossible to heal.
A sizeable portion of the country voted for the candidate who didn't become president. Tens of thousands of Americans took to the streets the night after the election, chanting that the man who was elected was "not my president."
President-elect Donald Trump said in their victory speech that "it's time for America to bind the wounds of division." Their Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, said in their concession speech that "it's time for us to come together."
"We all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens," President Barack Obama told Americans on Wednesday. "That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years."
It didn't help that the country was painfully divided before the election, too. A Pew Research poll in September found 57% of Americans feel "frustrated," 55% "disgusted," and 43% "scared" about the 2016 election. Only 15% said they feel "optimistic."
Though we don't have similar polling to prove it, citizens felt a similar way when our country was just in its infancy.
The election of 1800 was the first time the US political landscape fractured into two parties.
That fact — combined with some odd vice presidential voting rules that were subsequently fixed with the 12th Amendment— contributed to an outcome the founding fathers didn't expect: a tie.
This sent the decision of who would sit in the Oval Office to the House of Representatives. It took them 36 ballots to settle on Thomas Jefferson as the nation's third president.
Thomas Jefferson, the third US president. Wikipedia As the country reeled from the political whiplash, Jefferson praised the nascent democracy for its peaceful transition of power in their first inaugural address on March 4, 1801.
"But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle," they said. "We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."
Those were the names of the two brand new political parties. Though they've undergone many iterations over the last 216 years, what was then called the Jeffersonian Republicans (or the Democrat-Republicans, confusingly enough) has since morphed into today's Democratic Party, and the Federalists have become the Republican Party.
By declaring all Americans were of one mindset — and could keep functioning as one republic — Jefferson underlined that the states were truly stronger together. Not even a Civil War 60 years later could break that bond.
Jefferson continued:
"I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong, that this Government is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Government, the world's best hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest Government on earth. I believe it the only one where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the public order as their own personal concern."
In today's similarly turbulent political climate, Jefferson's wise words offer comfort that we will eventually come together, and the American experiment can work. It has so far.
"Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself," they said. "Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question."

Bern Gets Crowdsourced Rail Cars
Crowdsourcing has come to yet another area of human activity: rail car design.
Railway Gazette International reports that Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn (Bern-Solothurn Regional Transport) has placed an order with Stadler Rail for 14 custom-designed electric multiple-unit train sets. The trains' design specifications were developed partly by “crowdsourcing” ideas from passengers on the line where they will run, Route S7.
According to the International Railway Journal's report on the purchase, Route S7, which connects Bern and Worb, is the busiest of RBS' meter-gauge regional rail lines, carrying 24,000 riders daily.
Each of the train sets will have four cars totaling 60 meters (197 feet) in length. The train sets will have seating for 160 passengers and can accommodate 360 standing passengers. Each partly-low-floor car has two doors per side, or eight doors on each side of the train, and large standing areas for faster boarding and alighting.
The 134-million-Swiss franc ($144.3 million U.S.) order, which includes spare parts for the trains, is the largest ever for the Swiss capital's regional transport agency.
Stadler Rail owner and CEO Peter Spuhler told Railway Gazette they were “pleased that the opinion of the passengers was involved in the development process from the very beginning, and we now may decisively contribute to their comfort.”

Trams to Make Comeback in Cairo
More meter-gauge railway news comes from Cairo, where a meter-gauge tram system serving the city and neighboring Heliopolis shut down in 2014 due to deterioration of the infrastructure and rolling stock after decades of underinvestment.
The International Railway Journal reports that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will loan the Egyptian government $250 million to finance half of the $500 million cost of rehabilitating the system and purchasing new tram cars.
The memorandum of understanding between the EBRD and Egypt's Ministry of International Cooperation calls for two loans of up to $125 million each. The first loan will go to the National Authority for Tunnels and will help pay for restoration of the tracks and power supply system, while the second loan will go to a private company that will purchase, operate and maintain the rolling stock.
Miami Considers Another Tax Hike to Fund Rail Expansion
Residents of Miami-Dade County may be forgiven a feeling of déjà vu over the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Organization's recent approval of the “Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit” (SMART) plan, which calls for five new light rail lines and a new Tri-Rail commuter rail line to be built over an unspecified time frame.
That's because voters approved a half-cent sales tax increase in 2002 in order to build these same six lines. Most of the proceeds from that tax went instead to retiring existing debt for transportation projects; the only rail line built with the money was a 3.8-km (2.4-mile) Metrorail extension to Miami International Airport.
A Miami Metromover pulls into Third Street station.
As a result, residents and elected officials the Kendall Gazette interviewed for a news story on the plan expressed a combination of support for the proposal and skepticism about how it would be paid for and whether the lines would actually get built.
Kendall is one of the communities slated to get rail service under the SMART plan, which also includes four other light rail lines — one connecting Miami with Miami Beach via the MacArthur Causeway, a replacement for a busway along busy Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) in south Miami-Dade, an east-west line intended to provide congestion relief for the Dolphin Expressway, and a north-south line along 27th Avenue in north Miami, along with a 136-km (84.5-mile) Tri-Rail commuter line from Miami north to Boca Raton and Jupiter.
Most of the Kendall residents who spoke with the paper expressed sentiments similar to those of Kendall Federation of Homeowner Associations President Michael Rosenberg, who said, “The plans are incredibly ambitious. Then I saw the price tag, $12 billion, and thought about the timeframe to get this project done — decades.
“Then I read about the infighting that will take place as each commissioner fights to make sure their district is first. That could take centuries. My suggestion: Put the six corridors on the November ballot and let the community vote for who goes first.”
Kendale resident Diane Lawrence was more downbeat, saying, “I don't think it will happen in my lifetime. No one wants to raise taxes and that is what it will take.”
In other words, one possible outcome for the plan is that the voters approve another tax hike and get less than they bargained for once again.
An International Railway Journal report on the SMART plan says the MPO intends to conduct further studies to determine costs, possible funding sources and environmental impact for each of the six corridors.

Independent wine merchants can win on Portugal, says leading supplier
Independent wine merchants will have a field day selling Portuguese wine after supermarkets cut ranges to compete with discounters, according to a leading supplier.
Tesco is cutting 30% of its wine range and Morrisons is slashing 10% of its SKUs as multiples fight to regain share lost to the likes of Aldi and Lidl.
Nick Oakley, managing director of Oakley Wine Agencies, told OLN: “The independent trade is going to have its moment in the next year or two because the multiples are all severely chopping their ranges.
“Portugal, which is not sexy, will get the bum's rush. The independents will fill that void. It's an area of the business that we really want to concentrate on. We are known for supermarket distribution but not for independent.”
Oakley Wine Agencies has built up a solid business supplying own-label Portuguese wine to the multiples, and supermarkets make up the majority of its business.
Oakley is celebrating 25 years in the business this year, and runs the agency with just their wife Jane and daughter Charlotte, but it has a turnover of £4 million and supplied 220,000 cases last year.
They said: “When I started 25 years ago you couldn't sell Portuguese wine for love nor money. It's still hard. It's not as sexy as New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc or Rioja.
“Portugal is going to be the next big thing has been said in the press every year for the 25 years we have been doing it, and it never ever has. But Dao and Douro and Vinho Verde have gained traction very strongly.
“Three of the world's top four wines in Wine Spectator were Portuguese, yet what sells most is Bordeaux, Burgundy, Rioja, New Zealand, California, and way down the list is Portugal.
“We see this as potential to tap, which is why we are still very excited about what we are doing. You can't continue to have such praise for Portugal and for it not to translate into sales.”
Oakley's main bugbear is a refusal among Portuguese producers to promote the regionality of the wines. They have refused to supply any wines to the UK multiples that do not feature the region in big, bold letters on the label.
“We had a Dao in one multiple and it was delisted after selling five cases a week and branded a complete failure,” said Oakley, who is fluent in Portuguese. “‘Dao' was really small on the label. The Dao we have in Asda sells significant quantities every week and it's because the word Dao is much bigger, in bold letters.
“Asda Dao sold so fast over Christmas, they trebled their sales, and it ran out. The warehouse was selling so quickly that we couldn't fill it back up in time. We had out of stock caused by speed of sale.
“The other producer has now redesigned their label to have Dao bigger. We have to promote the regionality. But the Portuguese won't listen. I will only sell wines to the multiples that say the appellation in large letters. We have got to promote the regions.
“If you hide behind a brand it doesn't sell. Forget about brands: use the appellation and the producer's name.”
Oakley, who is now preparing to launch in Majestic, believes own-label will continue to be a crucial part of multiple retailers' strategies.
“Own label is becoming entrenched,” they said. “Nobody wants to compete with anybody else on brands. Soft brands lose shelf position because it's too competitive; people down the road will sell it cheaper.
“Then people wanted exclusive and then they said forget about it, just make us an own-label. We have launched Morrisons Douro Red and you can't price-match against Asda Douro Red because it's different.”
But they are encouraged too by independents' abilities to hand-sell Portuguese wine and believes small regional chains have a bright future ahead of them.
“Since the demise of Threshers, quite a few small groups with three to five units – Amathus, Hemmings, Vineking, Lea and Sandeman, Cambridge Wine Merchants, Tanners, Vino, Secret Cellars – people that can buy 20-dozen cases and get through them quite quickly,” they said. “Portugal needs hand-selling. That's the challenge. It needs open bottles. You need to constantly encourage people.
“Independents are only 5% of our turnover but that's increasing substantially.
“The way we sell makes us good for independents. We offer half-pallets at almost ex-cellar prices from stock lodged in London. You are almost buying it from the vineyards.”

Roughriders re-sign receiver Chris Getzlaf

Who says you can never go home again?
The Saskatchewan Roughriders have re-signed Regina-born Chris Getzlaf less than two years after deeming the veteran receiver expendable.

Getzlaf, who played eight years for the Riders, found themselves on the outside looking in when Chris Jones took over the Riders organization in 2016.
The two sides never discussed contract renewal, so Getzlaf took their talents to Edmonton.
After playing in all 18 games for the Eskimos last year, they have only appeared in eight games in 2017.
"I was on the practice roster for about a month there and I didn't see that roster spot changing." said Getzlaf after their first practice back with the Riders on Monday.
With the family back in Regina, and a practice roster salary in Edmonton, it didn't make economical sense for Getzlaf to stay in that situation, so they asked for and was granted their release.
"It becomes pretty expensive when you're paying for a spot at home and paying for a spot out there, I just thought it would be best to take my chances of landing somewhere else and hopefully it would be here and it ended up being here.'

It didn't take long for Getzlaf and the Riders to hook up, now that they were available for a bargain basement price.
Jones was singing Getzlaf's praises on Monday.
"He's a great guy." said Jones.
"He came in and wanted to be a part of what we're doing and certainly they figure into what we're doing he's just an outstanding individual."
Getzlaf will start off on the Riders' practice roster. He's looking forward to playing in front of Rider fans again.
"You know the fans, how passionate they are here, I played in front of them in my hometown for an extended period of time, having a chance to come back is rewarding."
Getzlaf has close to 6,200 yards receiving in their CFL career. They were the most outstanding Canadian in the 2013 Grey Cup game.
Getting ready for Calgary
The Roughriders will likely be looking at a number of changes for Friday's game in Calgary.
Naaman Roosevelt, who sat out the game in Ottawa with concussion-type symptoms, banged their head again in Friday's game against the Redblacks and will probably not make the trip.
"I've got to play that one with caution. I'm going to try and play it just like I would If it were my son" said Jones on Roosevelt's status.
Riders' head coach Chris Jones says they will treat Naaman Roosevelt with caution. "Like it were my own son." (Glenn Reid/CBC)
"We will go through the protocol and do exactly what the CFL says and then of course the trainers and doctors know a whole more than I do."
Roosevelt was the Riders leading receiver until being passed by Duron Carter in Friday's loss to the Redblacks.
Chad Owens practiced in Roosevelt's spot on Monday and is poised to finally make their Riders' debut this Friday.
Dan Clark is off the six-game injured list and appears ready to reclaim their centre spot on Friday, shifting Brendon Labatte back to left guard.
Derek Dennis who was playing left of centre on the offensive line is now nursing a lower back injury.
Running back Cameron Marshall is also ready to return to the active roster.

"We went straight to the emergency room and from the emergency room, the FBI was contacted," Friday says. "So they never even had that choice of what they wanted to do. It was just straight in."
Friday says even standard exam procedures can traumatize victims further, like their daughter being abruptly asked to remove their clothes and put their feet in stirrups.
The cultural insensitivity of non-tribal hospitals leads a lot of women not to report, Friday says. And without official reports, there's no way to bring charges.
But Friday thinks more women might report with the help of an organization called Safe Stars.
"If we had had this available to us, this is the way we would have gone," Friday says.
Safe Stars is a national group that allows victims to call a respected tribal woman in the community for confidential emergency care and evidence collection. The idea is the brain child of Hallie Bongar White, an attorney for the Southwest Center for Law and Policy.
"Several years ago, we realized that there was a huge disconnect between the volume of sexual violence in Indian Country and the criminal justice, health care, social services and community responses to sexual violence," Bongar White says.
Bongar White explains that volunteers take a 40-hour course to train becoming sexual assault first responders.
"They're able to photograph injuries, use buccal swabs," Bongar White says. "If there's clothing with semen on it, they're able to package all the evidence."
The question is, will more reports turn into more convictions?
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kerry Jacobson supports the Safe Star cause and prosecutes rapes on Wind River. But they worry about using evidence collected by volunteers.
"If you've got physical evidence being collected out of a Safe Star's car or home, then there's going to be at least the specter of potential tainting," Jacobson says.
But even if Safe Stars can't get more convictions, Jacobson says it'll do something equally important: give victims a circle of respected women to protect them.
Since their daughter's attack, Northern Arapaho Millie Friday has been training to become a Safe Star volunteer herself.
The FBI specially designed a black metal box just for Safe Stars to use in the field. In addition to emergency contraceptive pills, Friday also plans to stock their kit with traditional healing plants they can offer rape victims.
"I would add sweetgrass and I'd even add cedar and then sage is good too," Friday says.
They would offer them immediately following an assault to calm victims so they can make hard decisions.
"Having that access to our culture, I feel that's what we bring too is that holistic idea of healing and using our culture to heal them," Friday says.
Friday believes this kind of cultural therapies will lead to better evidence collection, more convictions and to the real goal: stopping the cycle of rape culture that has haunted tribes for generations.
Gov. Tom Corbett on Monday said that their administration will drop its effort to privatize management of the Pennsylvania Lottery.
The move caps a year in which two of Corbett's three priorities — public pension reform and liquor privatization — stalled in the Republican-controlled General Assembly. Their push to boost transportation funding became reality, but in scaled-down legislation.
Corbett said they will continue to review lottery operations but did not delve into specifics.
“As we move forward, we will take what we've learned to make our successful lottery even better — expanding the player and retailer base, improving player loyalty and implementing strategies that will grow our lottery, responsibly and efficiently,” they said.
The governor appeared for an event at a nursing home in Gibsonia but did not mention the lottery, opting instead to announce their decision through a news release.
Corbett's office said it will not extend the life of a British company's roughly year-old bid to run the lottery, which Corbett said could have increased its profit by as much as $5 billion during a 20-year contract. Camelot Global Services Inc. sought the contract in return for a guarantee of at least $34.6 billion in profit to the state and the addition of the popular casino game keno.
A spokesperson for Camelot said the decision was mutual and reflected “changes in the political and competitive environment.”
“We remain on good terms with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and are open to future possibilities,” said Alex Kovach, managing director of Camelot Global.
Lawmakers and lottery employees had objected to the plan when they learned Camelot was the sole bidder and that the deal included provisions to add keno to the lottery.
On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills, said he'd be willing to reconsider privatizing the lottery, provided the proposal involved multiple bidders, required transparency and accountability in operations, and protected the jobs of lottery employees.
“The governor flew solo on that the last time. Now we need to get the General Assembly in on the conversation,” Costa said.
Corbett sought their first extension on the Camelot contract in February, when state Attorney General Kathleen Kane ruled the agreement was unconstitutional. They said the administration sidestepped legislative approval of the deal, which was necessary because it would expand the lottery.
Corbett pushed it throughout the year, seeking extensions.
Auditor General Eugene DePasquale this month criticized Corbett, saying legal and consulting fees for the stalled deal likely would cost taxpayers about $4.6 million by year's end.
The lottery, begun in 1972, posts profit of just over $1 billion a year. During the past four decades, it has funneled $23.7 billion into programs for senior citizens, including property tax and rent rebates, and transit and prescription drug programs.
Though many lawmakers were at odds with the administration over the Camelot contract, few disputed the need to expand lottery profit as the state's population ages.
House Democratic leaders hailed Corbett's announcement and reiterated their stand against privatization.
“The Pennsylvania Lottery is one of our strongest assets as it continues to set records for ticket sales and profits. That's because of the creative and dedicated people who make it work and the loyalty of ticket purchasers. In the best interest of older Pennsylvanians, we should keep the lottery in place and build on what has been proven to work,” House Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D-Oakmont, said in a statement with Democratic Whip Mike Hanna, D-Lock Haven, and Appropriations Committee Minority Chairman Joe Markosek, D-Monroeville.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, R-Chester, said the Senate will take up privatizing and expanding the lottery in hearings.
“We think it's still very much an issue worthy of exploration,” said Pileggi spokesperson Erik Arneson.

Washington (CNN) -- While President Obama's war council deliberates its strategy toward Afghanistan, the ghost of Vietnam is often invoked as a warning.
Afghanistan, U.S. and coalition forces have been fighting in Afghanistan for eight years, and until recently the war had been overshadowed by the one in Iraq. In March, Afghanistan will become America's longest war, surpassing the Vietnam War.
The Vietnam War, which cost 58,000 American lives, is the one most often invoked when U.S. troops are committed overseas.
Although some say Afghanistan is "Obama's Vietnam," experts say there are several major similarities and differences between the two wars.
Eric Margolis, a veteran journalist and former Army soldier who served during the Vietnam War, said the biggest problem the United States is facing now -- as in Vietnam -- is fighting the mostly poor, rural insurgents who live among Afghans.
"It makes it very difficult to drive [insurgents] out, because they can stay there forever. ... They're at home. When we attack villages where they are, we kill a lot of civilians, causing an uproar and turning the people more against us."
Steve Clemons of the nonpartisan New America Foundation said one of the factors in the Soviet-Afghan War -- which pitted the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan with the Soviet military against the Islamist Mujahideen Resistance -- was the brutal attacks inflicted on both fighters and civilians by the Soviets.
"[There] was the sense of outrage and grievance at some of the things that they had done and the triggering of a deeply felt emotional antagonism to the Soviet effort to dominate and colonize Afghanistan among the Pashtun."
They worry that if the United States fails to focus on a more humanitarian and diplomatic approach, Americans will fall into the same trap the Soviets faced, which ultimately led to them leaving the country defeated.
"I think one of the things I'm concerned about is whether or not we're triggering those same kind of emotions among the Pashtuns today. And believe me, the Pashtuns don't care whether they're [going after] Americans or going after the Soviets. If you begin to threaten their own perception of their own independence, then you turn Pashtuns into Taliban."
Peter Beinart, who recently wrote an article called "Bury the Vietnam Analogy" on TheDailyBeast.com, has said there is a real sense of national identity for Afghanis that wasn't seen in South Vietnam.
"Afghanistan is a real country that Afghans generally believe in. They have an Afghan national identity. That didn't exist in South Vietnam," they said, adding that the Taliban is much less popular in Afghanistan than the Viet Cong was in South Vietnam.
In Vietnam, the Communists controlled the nationalist movement and had the nationalist legitimacy. The Taliban, meanwhile, is not as organized as the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army were.
But there is evidence the Taliban is changing, as shown by a series of recent well-coordinated attacks on remote Afghanistan outposts.
Journalist Margolis also compared the government of Afghanistan to the government of South Vietnam.
"In both cases, the government of Saigon [South Vietnam] and Kabul [Afghanistan] are heavily influenced by minorities. We have made our enemies [among] the ethnic majority in Afghanistan who are the Pashtuns -- pretty well cut them out of power."
The recent Afghanistan elections received worldwide attention for claims of fraud by the incumbent, President Hamid Karzai, who reportedly won the election. After fierce international criticism, Karzai recently agreed to a runoff.
Another difference between the two wars comes in terms of troop numbers, Beinart said.
"I think what's clear is that the resources we put in Afghanistan have been absolutely minuscule compared to Vietnam and compared to Iraq. ... In 1968, we had over 500,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam. We had up until a couple of years ago only about 20,000 [in Afghanistan]. ... So what's clear is, we haven't made anywhere near the kind of commitment to Afghanistan as we made to Vietnam."
In the past month, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, issued a report to the president and the administration, outlining the problems facing the nation and what resources will be needed. Their prescription: more troops -- upwards of 40,000 by some estimates -- with the goal focusing on securing Afghan towns and cities in certain areas.
"And McChrystal's request, that we need to actually protect the Afghanis in this situation as opposed to just go after and try to kill bad guys on the other team, is a very different approach than Vietnam and I don't think has received enough attention," Clemons said.
One of Obama's biggest critics recently lashed out over the president's deliberations on how to proceed in Afghanistan.
Former Vice President Dick Cheney said last week that Obama has failed to give troops on the ground a clear mission or defined goals and appeared "afraid to make a decision."
"The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger," they said. "Make no mistake, signals of indecision out of Washington hurt our allies and embolden our adversaries."
But on Sunday, a top Republican beat back against such criticism.
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said they thought some of Obama's critics have been "hypercritical" in suggesting that the president was delaying a decision about Afghanistan.
Appearing on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, also defended the president, saying they are using a "very proper and smart process" in taking time to weigh all options on the table.
And public opinion may be part of the reason: There is declining support among Americans over sending more troops.
A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, taken October 16-18, showed 59 percent of Americans opposed sending more troops into the country. The same poll found that 52 percent of Americans consider the war in Afghanistan has turned into another Vietnam War situation, while 46 say it's not.
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
“Is homosexuality a psychological disorder? And could it be cured?”
These are the “dead-horse” questions that blogger Melinda Selmys mentions as they take exception to the substance of a Crisis Magazine article on homosexuality—Mark Latkovic's “Using Modern Science to Treat Homosexuality.” Selmys considers this question—“homosexuality as mental illness”—as tantamount to a lifeless horse brought back to race again.
Selmys claims in their post that the “psychopathologization of homosexuality” is incompatible with the Christian view. Unfortunately, Selmys' flimsy claims are obscuring some crucial elements of Catholic teaching about the human person and homosexuality, and must be addressed.
What Is “Normal”?
Selmys flatly asserts that they “won't use the word normal” in reference to “heterosexual functioning” as Latkovic did when framing their assertion that “[t]oday, of course, the majority of psychologists and mental health care professionals deny that there is anything abnormal about homosexuality.”
They go on to claim that “[t]he the biggest problem with this article … is that it confuses the historical teaching of the psychological establishment with the historical teaching of Christianity.”
By pitting the “concept of homosexuality” as arising from “modern psychology” against their claim that Church teaching prior to this was all about “sins” and “acts” rather than persons, they seem to accuse Latkovic of embracing the modern-psych view of “homosexual” and “heterosexual” as “discreet sexual species of person.” That is, anyone who makes the claim that one element of same-sex attraction is psychological disorder (as Latkovic does) is effectively siding with a non-Christian understanding of the human person.
Selmys's claim is, frankly, silly. The mere fact that even the Catechism takes for granted that same-sex attraction has a still-mysterious and only-partially-explained “psychological genesis” (CCC 2357) is nowhere to be found in Selmys' critique. A Catholic is quite right to view a persistent same-sex attraction as being associated with some form of psychological disorder.
The Church's ‘No' to Orientation Ideology
Selmys further attempts to use a magisterial quote to argue against what the secular culture would call “heteronormativity”—a buy-in to a relativization of God's plan for sexuality with every other culturally constructed “sexual identity” label. The 1986 CDF document “On the Pastoral Care of Homsexual Persons” includes this quote (#16):
The human person, made in the image and likeness of God, can hardly be adequately described by a reductionist reference to their or their sexual orientation. Every one living on the face of the earth has personal problems and difficulties, but challenges to growth, strengths, talents and gifts as well. Today, the Church provides a badly needed context for the care of the human person when they refuse to consider the person as a “heterosexual” or a “homosexual” and insists that every person has a fundamental Identity: the creature of God, and by grace, their child and heir to eternal life.
Selmys replies:
You kind of can't have your cake and eat it here. The document does not say “there is only one orientation: heterosexual” it says “the Church … refuses to consider the person as a ‘heterosexual' or a ‘homosexual.' ” The point here is not that the Church insists on erasing gay identities, but rather that the Church refuses (at least in theory) to distinguish between persons on the basis of their sexual orientation. This statement not only rejects an ontological understanding of homosexuality, it also rejects the overt privileging of the heterosexual as some kind of superior caste.
Selmys is egregiously wrong in their interpretation of this text. But part of the error rests in the English translation of the official Latin text. Why? Because the word translated into English as “orientation” is the Latin “propensionis”—which is more aptly translated as “propensity,” “tendency,” or “inclination.” Of the eight occurrences of the Latin term, it's translated as “tendency” once, “inclination” three times, “orientation” three times, and omitted once from translation (“propensione homosexuali” rendered as “homosexual person” in English).
This is important to note because the Church does not in fact utilize the concept of “orientation” at all in its most theologically precise and official Latin texts. Inclination, tendency, propensity, yes. The English translator did us no favors by using the “identity” term of “orientation” in that text. It has apparently left Selmys and others with a mistaken impression that the Church—like culture—actually does embrace what should be called the culture's “orientation ideology.” Indeed, the point of the CDF quote is precisely to reject the culture's concept of “sexual identity” and orientation is not in keeping with the dignity of the human person. This is hugely important.
Yet Selmys adds further confusion by claiming the quote “rejects the overt privileging of the heterosexual as some kind of superior caste.” They confuse apples for oranges here—of course all persons are viewed by the Church with equal dignity. But the Church acknowledges the goodness of only sexuality (not homosexuality) in their teaching. Persons are all equally children of God. Homosexuality, however, remains a deficit, an objectively disordered inclination.
Acknowledging the ‘Spousal Meaning of the Body'
Latkovic identifies one aspect of the “disability” of homosexuality as being “the inability to establish a true marital relationship with a person of the opposite sex.” Selmys responds:
It's assumed here that the ability to marry is fundamental to healthy psychological functioning, and that anything else constitutes a disability. In the light of Catholic tradition, this is simply an absurd statement. Throughout most of the history of the Church the unmarried state has been consistently praised over and above the married state, so much so that many of the Saints have treated even the inclination to marry as a kind of spiritual or mental weakness. Now, I do think that it's a very great good that the Church has largely moved beyond that kind of thinking—but to claim that its precise inverse is the “historical teaching” of Christianity is simply risible.
But Latkovic's assessment is far from “risible”—rather, it's rooted in the teaching of Pope St. John Paul II, who saw the great good of the “spousal meaning of the body” as essential to the human person, both in marriage and in the renunciation of marriage through celibacy for the sake of the kingdom. Selmys sets up an utter straw man here. God's plan for us “body-souls” is clearly expressed in our identities as man or woman and our capacities to be total self-gifts as husbands and wives. Latkovic's assertions are quite correct.
Change or Chastity?
Selmys's continuing rejection of homosexuality as “disability” or “psychological disorder” sets up their rejection of seeking psychological help, which they seem to absolutize under the label of “orientation change.” By lumping all efforts at psychological treatment under the rubric of “orientation change,” their claim becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If “orientation” is the all-important identity marker that must be changed, then it's total failure if psychological help doesn't make one “heterosexual.”
But the Church's anthropology exists apart from the social constructs of “orientation” or “orientation change.” Rather, the authentically Catholic understanding that underlies psychological counseling for same-sex attraction is simpler: chastity. While Selmys even mentions Fr. Paul Check and the Courage apostolate, whose mission is chastity and not “orientation change,” they cannot seem to see that there really is a need for psychological help even in the realm of seeking chastity in the midst of same-sex attraction.
Selmys will use words like “weakness,” “obstacle,” and “limitation,” in apparent reference to same-sex attraction, but not “disability.” Instead of connecting the dots, they conclude: “Ultimately, the psychopathologization of homosexuality does not follow from traditional Christian anthropology, and it is harmful, not helpful, in terms of ministry to gay people.”
But this is false. Homosexuality is in the mind of the Church a form of “pathology,” spiritually and psychologically. Our authentically Catholic anthropology makes this self-evident. Latkovic's original essay gets this right.
Selmys urges us to abandon and finally bury this “particular dead horse.” The only problem is that this horse is still very much alive—and it's the one that we Catholics rode in on.
Three armed home invaders, all in their teens, are dead after choosing the wrong home in Oklahoma to rob this afternoon. They were met by the owner of the home's son who was armed with an AR-15 rifle.
Shortly after the men broke into the home, they were all dead from gunshot wounds from the rifle.
[Scroll Down For Video]
According to a report by NewsOn6:
The Wagoner County Sheriff's Office said the homeowner and their adult son were in the home when three males wearing masks and gloves tried to break in at about 12:30 p.m. The homeowner's son shot the intruders with a rifle, deputies said, killing all three.
Deputies say the males were 16, 17 and 18 years old. They said one teen had brass knuckles, one had a knife.
The sheriff's office said both the homeowner and their son, who's 23, are cooperating with the investigation and went to the sheriff's office to give statements to investigators.
A 21 year old woman, who is believed to be the getaway driver in the case, has turned themselves in to police. According to a Fox25 report:<
One person is in custody after three suspects in a Wagoner County home invasion were shot to death Monday afternoon by one of the residents.
According to the Wagoner County Sheriff's Office, the suspects' getaway driver has been arrested. The 21-year-old woman turned themselves in at the Broken Arrow Police Department hours after the shooting, saying they had information. Wagoner County investigators interviewed them at the police department and subsequently arrested them
The female suspect was later identified as Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez.  They are facing charges of burglary and homicide. In Oklahoma, accomplices in a crime can be charged with homicide if anyone is killed during the commission of a crime they are involved in.
It is currently unclear who the owner of the rifle is. The incident certainly appears to be a case of self defense at this time.
The AR-15 rifle, a semi-automatic, magazine fed rifle, most often chambered in 5.56x45mm, is a popular rifle among gun owners in the United States. Owners often cite its versatility for target shooting, self defense, and even hunting. Some gun control advocates would like to see the rifle banned. Some states have regulated the sale and/or ownership of semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles.
Here is the report from the local news on the shooting:
Here are two video reports documenting the incident with a spokesperson for the local police department.
This is the follow up to the original press conference:
A Boston-area teenager remains in custody on $1 million bond nearly one month after being arrested over what they said on the Internet.
Eighteen-year-old Cameron B. D'Ambrosio of Methuen, Massachusetts was arrested on May 1 after police were alerted to “disturbing verbiage” on their personal Facebook page discovered by a fellow student at Methuen High School. D'Ambrosio allegedly posted original rap lyrics that prompted authorities to charge them with terrorism, and now they face a potential 20 years in prison.
“He posted a threat in the form of rap where they mentioned the White House, the Boston Marathon bombing and said, ‘everybody you will see what I am going to do, kill people,” Methuen Police Chief Joe Solomon told the Valley Patriot earlier this month.
Three weeks after being surprised by police at their Methuen home, D'Ambrosio remains locked up.
“A kid is in prison. Away from their family. All for something they posted on Facebook” reads a support page for the high school student established this week by the Center for Rights and Fight for the Future. In 48 hours, the website received more than 500,000 views, and on Thursday the administrators said 1.2 million people had visited the page by the time D'Ambrosio went before a judge that morning for a scheduled bail hearing. The justice differed deciding at this time if D'Ambrosio should be released from custody.
“Cam's attorney made arguments that they should be released to their family and that all evidence (including testimony from the police) suggested that they were not a threat to anyone. They also noted that Cam was two weeks away from graduation, and Methuen High School had decided to grant them a diploma,” Fight for the Future wrote early Thursday. “We expect a decision within a few days and sincerely hope that Cam will be home safe with is family soon.”
Meanwhile, though, D'Ambrosio remains locked up if and until a judge decides they aren't a hazard to the community.
At the time of their arrest, school officials and law enforcement alike applauded the speedy response and celebrate D'Ambrosio's arrest as a victory against terrorism only a few days — and a few miles — from where two brothers allegedly detonated explosives at the Boston Marathon, killing three in the biggest act of terror in years on American soil. But nearly one month after being detained, authorities have not announced any proof that D'Ambrosio intended to act out the lyrics they left on their Facebook page.
“A search of Cam's house found no explosives, weapons, or ANY evidence that they were planning anything other than becoming the next Eminem,” their supporters write.
Among the Facebook content that alerted authorities was a song that was considered a warning of things to come.
“So when u see me (expletive) go insane and make the news, the paper, and the (expletive) federal house of horror known as the White House, Don't (expletive) cry or be worried because all YOU people (expletive) caused this (expletive),” reads a redacted version of one post made available to the Boston Herald.
Fox News quoted another song, in which the amateur rapper wrote "(expletive) the Boston bombing, wait til you see what I do. I'm going to be famous."
On their support page, it's noted that a key word was dropped from the line when it was reported by Fox. In actuality, D'Ambrosio wrote, “I'm going to be famous rapping.”
“Suddenly something that sounds like a threat of violence is clearly just bragging about how good Cammy Dee is going to be in the rap game. Last we checked, teenage dreams of grandeur were not a crime,” the website claims.
The 2010 NFL Draft was the 75th annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible football players. The 2010 draft took place over three days, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York, with the first round on Thursday, April 22, 2010, at 7:30 pm EDT. The second and third rounds took place on Friday, April 23 starting at 6:00 pm EDT, while the final four rounds were held on Saturday, April 24, starting at 10:00 am EDT.[1][2] Television coverage was provided by both NFL Network and ESPN.
The St. Louis Rams, as the team with the worst record during the 2009 season, selected quarterback Sam Bradford with the first pick. Three of the top four picks were members of the Oklahoma Sooners football team, and five of the top six were from the Big 12 Conference. The prime time broadcast of the first round was watched by 7.29 million viewers making it the most viewed first round ever and making ESPN the second most watched network of the night.[3][4]
Overview [ edit ]
Of the 255 players drafted 216 (or 84%) were among the 327 players who participated in the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine. This matches the average percentage of combine participants among draftees over the past ten years. An additional 39 players who did not attend the combine were selected.[5][6]
There was wide speculation that the 2010 NFL Draft would have a very large number of early entrants because of a possible rookie pay scale to be imposed starting with the 2011 NFL Draft.[7][8][9][10] Eligible underclassmen projected as top NFL prospects risked losing millions of contractually-guaranteed dollars if they did not declare for the draft the year before a new CBA could be reached. The early entry deadline was January 15. After the early entry deadline had passed, it was confirmed that the 2010 NFL Draft would have fifty-three non-seniors, tying a draft record for the most non-seniors ever.[11]
The draft's first round, in which teams were allowed ten minutes to make each selection, consumed three hours and 28 minutes. The second round (with a maximum of seven minutes per selection) lasted two hours and 25 minutes. After the second round, teams were allotted five minutes per pick. The third round took one hour and 41 minutes. Rounds 4 through 7 each lasted less than two hours.[12] For the second time in draft history, the first two players selected were named Offensive and Defensive Rookies of the Year, respectively.[13]
The following is the breakdown of the 255 players selected by position:
Changes in draft order [ edit ]
At the 2009 annual owners meeting, NFL owners unanimously approved changes to the order for assigning draft picks, starting with the 2010 draft.[14]
The new format took into account the seeding of playoff teams. The two major changes from previous years were:
Teams that make the playoffs pick after teams that do not.
Teams that advance further in the playoffs pick later. In 2008, the Chargers, who went 8–8 in the regular season, defeated the 12–4 Indianapolis Colts in an AFC Wild Card game. Nevertheless, the Chargers received the 16th pick while the Colts picked 27th, and the Patriots, who missed the playoffs, picked 23rd according to the rules then in effect, which prioritized regular season record for all teams except those in the Super Bowl.
The new order assigns picks for each round as indicated in the table below. With the exception of the changes noted above, the order will generally follow that used in previous years (i.e., within a given status, teams with worse regular-season records will pick earlier in the first round, and picks will cycle from round to round among teams that are tied).
Three coin tosses were necessary to establish the final selection order: Jacksonville, Tennessee, and Atlanta won their flips over Denver, Carolina, and Houston, respectively.[15]

Andre Satcher
Andre Satcher, 28, was arrested Saturday (Dec. 17) in connection with a carjacking on Canal Street. They were charged with two counts of carjacking, two counts of armed robbery with a firearm, possession of a firearm by a felon, negligent injuring, hit and run, and reckless operation of a vehicle.
(Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office)
A bystander was shot during the attempted carjacking of a Lyft driver at the corner of Canal Street and Roosevelt Way early Saturday (Dec. 17), according to the New Orleans Police Department. The victim, who police initially said was a bellhop, was wounded after the Lyft driver opened fire when a 28-year-old man tried to steal their car while the driver and a female passenger where stopped at a red light, NOPD Eighth District Commander Nicholas Gernon said during a press conference Saturday afternoon.
The confrontation began around 1:30 a.m. Saturday soon after the 35-year-old male driver picked up a 29-year-old local woman at a hotel on Canal Street, police said. When the vehicle pulled up to a nearby stoplight, a man got out of a silver sedan with a gun in their hand and demanded that the driver and their passenger get out of their vehicle.
"As (the driver) was getting out of the vehicle they grabbed their pistol off the door and started shooting," police said in a preliminary report. According to Gernon, the suspected carjacker "made a motion" that prompted the driver to fear he'd be shot. The driver fired multiple shots, though Gernon said it was too early in the investigation to say how many shots had been fired.
A 29-year-old bystander, who police initially said was a bellhop, was shot as they stood nearby. They were treated for a graze wound to their hand and has been released from the hospital, Gernon said.
The shooting, however, did not stop the carjacker from taking the vehicle, police said.
Panicked, the suspected carjacker fled in the driver's car heading south on Canal, Gernon said. They hopped the neutral ground and tried to make a u-turn, nearly hitting two NOPD Eighth District officers in the process who were conducting traffic control, Gernon said. As more officers responded, the carjacker hit three vehicles as they attempted to escape, then jumped out of the car. They got a few steps before officers apprehended him, Gernon said.
The suspected carjacker, Andre Satcher, 28, was booked into Orleans Parish jail on several counts including carjacking, armed robbery with a firearm, negligent injuring, illegal carrying of a firearm by a felon, hit and run and a host of other traffic violations. Bond was set at 400,000.
Prior to Saturday, court records show Satcher has been arrested three times since 2007 on charges including aggravated assault with a firearm, flight from an officer, second-degree kidnapping and first-degree murder. Brought in 2009, the murder and kidnapping charges were later refused, records show.
The 35-year-old driver -- who police have not identified -- has not been charged in connection with the shooting. Gernon said the gun was registered to the driver, and that they remained on scene after the shooting to hand over their weapon.
"At this point, we feel as though they were acting in response to a threat to their life," Gernon said. "But we will put the entire package together for the district attorney's office to give them the opportunity to review our work independently, and see if there's anything there they might have some criminal culpability for."
"At this point, they are the victim of a carjacking," Gernon added.
Gernon could not say for certain whether Satcher also fired their weapon.
In an initial incident report, police said the shooting victim was a bellman at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. Later, the Ritz-Carlton had issued a statement saying the shooting victim was not an employee and the incident did not begin at their hotel.
"After thorough investigation, no guest or employee at The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans has been harmed. This incident did not occur at our property," said the statement from spokesperson Kristen Barnes. Barnes later said that they had confirmed the pick-up also didn't occur at the hotel. Police have said the investigation into the incident is ongoing.
Gernon said the shooting victim was a "local man standing at the corner."

The nine-part docu-series Sarah Palin's Alaska, shown late last year on the cable channel TLC, has the atmosphere of a cold war propaganda film.1 It shows the Palin family during the summer of 2010, making happy trips to one pristine Alaskan wilderness area after another—fishing, hunting, kayaking, dogsledding, rock climbing—and taking repeated little swipes at the left. During a visit with their dad to a store in Anchorage named Chimo Guns, where they are buying a rifle for a camping trip in bear country, Palin remarks:
Out and about in Alaska's wilds it's more common than not to see somebody having some kind of weapon on their person, in fact it's probably as commonplace as if you're walking down in New York City and you see somebody with a Blackberry on their hip.
New York, of course, is code for all the things that Palin-style populism is against. I don't have to tell my fellow Commies what these things are.
Not long ago Paul Krugman neatly distinguished between our two political sides. One side, they wrote in the Times,
considers the modern welfare state—a private-enterprise economy, but one in which society's winners are taxed to pay for a social safety net—morally superior to the capitalism red in tooth and claw we had before the New Deal. It's only right, this side believes, for the affluent to help the less fortunate.
The other side
believes that people have a right to keep what they earn, and that taxing them to support others, no matter how needy, amounts to theft. That's what lies behind the modern right's fondness for violent rhetoric: many activists on the right really do see taxes and regulation as tyrannical impositions on their liberty.2
The Palins travel in small planes into the tooth-and-claw wilderness to enact their allegory of unspoiled capitalism. Palin, who is both narrator and star of the series, performs arduous and sometimes even dangerous feats of outdoorsmanship to demonstrate the conservative virtue of self-reliance. In the episode in which they struggle for a foothold on a vertiginously steep glacier at the foot of Mt. McKinley in eerily beautiful and vast Denali National Park, they know that no government handout is going to help them They aren't even sure God will help her, though they cry out to Him and Their Son, “Oh God. Help me, Lord!” and “I'm scared…. Holy Jeez!”  They are tied by a rope to a guide above them and their husband below, but they can't seem to make progress on the rock. The guide gives them instructions, but they can't follow them. “I don't know what I'm going to hold on to…
Even less than Santorum, Huntsman, Gingrich

October 14, 2011
Despite being consistently ranked in the top three in GOP presidential candidate preference polls, Ron Paul has been given the least time to speak OUT OF ALL THE CANDIDATES at the debates that have taken place thus far.
Confirmation of this fact comes in the form of a study from the University of Minnesota, published to the Smart Politics blog.
The study has tallied the total face time that candidates were afforded during the last three debates. The results speak for themselves.
TPM took these numbers and displayed them visually below:
Ron Paul has received just 18 minutes and 47 seconds of time, less than any other candidate, and less than half the time that Mitt Romney has been allowed.
Indeed, Romney has racked up a total of 41 minutes and 9 seconds of speaking time over the debates, close to seven minutes more than the next closest candidate, Rick Perry who has received 34 minutes, 12 seconds.
The Study notes that during Tuesday's debate, Romney received a full quarter of the speaking time, meaning they had almost doubled the time of all the other candidates and approaching three times the amount Ron Paul was given.
Despite being placed third in a Harvard University Institute of Politics and New Hampshire Institute of Politics poll prior to the Washington Post/Bloomberg debate, Ron Paul received just 26 and 21 seconds more speaking time than Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum respectively.
Even when they are not speaking, it seems Romney is the focus of the attention, on Tuesday Romney was afforded:
· 194 percent more camera time than Rick Santorum
· 190 percent more than Jon Huntsman
· 171 percent more than Ron Paul
· 157 percent more than Newt Gingrich
· 103 percent more than Michele Bachmann
· 100 percent more than Herman Cain
· 77 percent more than Rick Perry
The gross inequality displayed here will only serve to confirm assertions that the mainstream media is engaged in a conspiracy to sideline, ignore and discredit Paul's campaign.
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:74}
Even the authors of the study at the University of Minnesota question the amount of time Paul is getting. They note:
“The fact that Congressman Paul has received less than half the amount of speaking time as Romney (and less than any other candidate) is curious considering the libertarian firebrand has run third or fourth in most polls throughout the last several months.”
The establishment denigrates Paul's campaign not because they think they can't win, but because they're scared they could win. That's why they've made it their job to try and derail their momentum at every turn. It's their job to manipulate the American public into thinking they're wasting their vote if they support Paul because they have no chance of winning, when the opposite is true, they have every chance of winning, if only they were given an equal platform with the other candidates.
The Paul campaign today released another ad, this time titled simply “Life”. In a moving and personal account, Dr Paul Explains why they oppose abortion, and recounts an experience of watching an abortion firsthand.
The spot will air next week in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

COLBERT: This is your first interview after having left the Obama team because you called Hillary Clinton a monster. True?
POWER: Sadly, yes.
COLBERT: First of all, I think it's a great development for America that members of both teams, Obama and Clinton, are quitting for things that they said about the other side. Eventually there will be no one left to say the things that both sides actually think about each other except the candidates themselves. Then we put them in a sand pit and make them wrestle.
POWER: Each camp has a lot of amazing people left.
COLBERT: Okay. Fantastic. Do you want to clarify what kind of monster while we're here, by the way?
POWER: Can I just clarify and say I don't think Hillary Clinton is a monster and I get to be on television and say that.
COLBERT: There's a way to make it positive. Why not embrace it?
POWER: No, no, no.
COLBERT: What about a good monster like Cookie Monster? And their campaign slogan - I'm helping out here - the campaign slogan could be "C is for Clinton, that's good enough for me." Think about it.
POWER: I need help.
COLBERT: Great. I'm willing to say that John McCain is a minotaur.
— Dominique Wilkins remembers a time not so long ago when the most-anticipated event during NBA All-Star Weekend was the Sprite Slam Dunk, how fans looked forward to their duels with Michael Jordan and what creative slam they would come up with next.
Now?
"It's different," they said Friday, drawing laughs from a crowd of reporters that surrounded them in a large hotel ballroom in midtown Manhattan. "We never used props. I jumped over a car when I was a kid."
I do feel like it's the best competition ever. It has that feel. – Clippers' J.J. Redick
Indeed, the days when the Human Highlight Film joined Air Jordan in a battle with a ball and a 10-foot hoop are long gone. Many of the game's most notable names never participate in the dunk contest anymore, and this year's field -- Giannis Antetokounmpo, Victor Oladipo, Mason Plumlee and Zach LaVine -- has little hype heading into Saturday night's event at Brooklyn's Barclays Center.
Instead, this may be a rare year when the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest has more appeal.
Golden State Warriors guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are headlining the event with Atlanta's Kyle Korver, Houston's James Harden and Cleveland's Kyrie Irving, Portland's Wesley Matthews, the Los Angeles Clippers' J.J. Redick and defending champion Marco Belinelli of San Antonio.
"It definitely should be one of the most fun parts of the weekend," Curry said.
Part of the extra intrigue is because the 3-point shot has never been more celebrated than it is now. The NBA has become an outside-inside league, where spreading the floor with shooters and moving the ball is all the rage.
And unlike the dunk contest, the best are participating in the 3-point shootout again.
Foot Locker Three-Point Contest How pumped are The Starters for this year's contest? Is this the best Three-Point Contest field we've ever seen? Who are the favorites?
"It seemed like there was a three- or four-year stretch where they were just getting random dudes, like, `Oh, you're coming to All-Star weekend? You can be in the 3-point contest!"' Redick said. "I was hoping this year they wouldn't invite (Nets center) Mason Plumlee, and they didn't. The field is great on paper. I do feel like it's the best competition ever. It has that feel."
SCHEDULE CHANGES: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wants to give their players a big assist and lighten their workload.
One of the chief complaints Silver heard during their rookie season on the job was about a condensed schedule that requires teams to play games on consecutive nights and sometimes as many as four games in five nights. Combined with travel, the busy schedule is taking a toll on players' health, which in turn weakens the product.
"My goal for next season is to reduce the number of back-to-backs," Silver said. "And then I don't know if I can completely eliminate four games in five nights, but bring that as close to zero as I can."
NBA Fit Celebration: Commissioner Silver NBA Commissioner Adam Silver states the NBA is hosting basketball clinics in 100 New York City schools on NBA FIT Friday to culminate NBA Cares All-Star efforts.
Silver made the comments while attending an NBA Cares All-Star Day of Service at Graphics Campus along with All-Stars LeBron James and Curry, who spent time shooting and doing drills with school kids.
Silver said the feedback they have received from players and teams prompted them to take a closer look at alleviating the 82-game regular-season schedule.
"We want players to be in optimal condition when they're playing those games," Silver said. "Part of it is a mathematical formula: There are so many games in so many days in which to get those games in. Having said that, there are steps we are taking even moving into next season where we hope to reduce the number of back-to-backs and hopefully come close to eliminating the four games in five nights."
Silver said the league intends to work closely with arenas to create more flexibility with the schedule.
RUNNER-UP STATUS: James doesn't like to finish second in anything. Ever.
But the Cavaliers superstar conceded Friday that he's currently behind Curry - and maybe Harden - in this season's MVP race.
"He and James have been doing some great things," James, a four-time league MVP, said of Curry. "You look at he's playing and you can't dispute that."
Curry was the leading vote-getter among fans for this year's All-Star game, beating out James, who remains the game's most popular player. Curry is averaging 23.6 points, 7.9 assists and 4.7 rebounds for the Warriors, who are a league-best 42-9 and atop the ultra-competitive Western Conference.
"Those guys are rolling and it's because of him," James said.
Media Day: LeBron James says the early season struggles was due to not knowing each other, everybody was new and now it has clicked because we trust each other.
As for James, who returned to Cleveland after four seasons in Miami, he's pleased where the Cavaliers find themselves at the break following a sluggish start.
"Right now, I think we're where we should be," they said of the Cavs, who are 33-22 at the break after winning 14 of 16. "I knew it was going to take us a couple months to get where I wanted it to be. At times it was frustrating, but I knew the process because I've been a part of it before and I understand how important the process is to creating a team."
VOTING FOR MVP: Reigning NBA MVP Kevin Durant didn't want to divulge their favorite for this season's award. They did, however, have plenty of opinions about the process.
For starters, Durant believes players should vote on the award instead of media.
"We know these guys. We battle against these guys every night. We know what they say on the court. We know how they handle their teammates. We know how they approach the game. Our vote should count. Our opinions should count," they said.
Durant also disagreed with how certain players are popular picks some years but not others. They noted how Curry and Harden are receiving more attention for MVP this season, saying both have been playing at an elite level for years and should've been in the conversation with them and James previously.
"I think the MVP is a lot about narratives and what may happen during that time," they said. "There are a lot of guys who have been playing extremely well for years and years and are just starting to get MVP consideration. I think that consistent play sometimes gets a little boring to people."
REPLACING DAVIS: Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is leading the Western Conference, said they haven't decided who he'll start in place of injured big man Anthony Davis. One possibility is Kerr's former teammate with the San Antonio Spurs, Tim Duncan, who is making their 15th and possibly last All-Star appearance.
"I joked with them that I may play them 40 minutes just to wear them out," Kerr said.
Last week, former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was back in the news. This time because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had decided to honour the man by building a memorial for them in Delhi.
The agenda of the BJP, more than the NDA, is clear. Every time it eulogises former Congress leaders such as Sardar Patel, the legendary home minister of the first government in independent India, or former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, a person, who, if they had remained alive, would have guided India to a rules-based economy faster than it is doing otherwise, the BJP is seeking to make a point: It is, not so subtly, rubbing in the claim that the country's oldest political party is run like a mom-and-pop store and, consequently, only the Gandhi-Nehru legacy would be acknowledged.
If we leave the politics aside for the moment, it is indeed important to remember Rao, but for the right reason. Plucked out of retirement, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, to lead the Congress party into its first coalition experiment, Rao did not disappoint. Some believe they excelled, and that was eventually their undoing in the palace intrigue of the Congress party.
Now, this is where the story skews. There is one lot that argues that they were the real hero of the economic reforms story. And there is another that argues that they were not really a believer in reforms, but the real architect was their self-effacing finance minister: Manmohan Singh.
Both views are misplaced. They stem from a flawed assumption: economic reforms began in 1991. Absolutely not. Have stated this before (and will continue to reiterate it) that the real story of economic reforms began in 1980 under the leadership of Indira Gandhi.
India encountered a severe balance of payments (BoP) crisis in 1979. The only way out was to take recourse to a structural adjustment loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which would entail the usual Washington formula of import tariff reductions, freer and greater participation for the private sector, paring of government presence in economic activity, and so on. However, it coincided with a recalibration of public policy towards a more market-based economy—captured so well in the Sixth Plan document piloted by Indira Gandhi.
So, the politically savvy prime minister decided to make virtue out of necessity. They volunteered the desired reforms—which included the dismantling of industrial licensing among other things—rather than accept them as humiliating conditionalities. And the finance minister who pushed it along was none other than Pranab Mukherjee, a true Indira loyalist.
Within three years, India came out of the crisis. Indira Gandhi promptly prepaid the loan and managed to avoid implementing most of the conditionalities, even as they rapidly started losing their way in domestic politics. The lessons of the BoP crisis were soon forgotten, till the country plunged into another one by 1989-90—which forced India to mortgage its gold reserves to raise money to avoid an external debt default.
At this stage, a minority government under prime minister Chandra Shekhar was in power, with Yashwant Sinha as the finance minister. They had access to a solution—entailing the revival of economic reforms and stepping on the accelerator—that had been readied by a high-level panel of serving technocrats. Sinha and their boss were convinced and readied to implement it in the upcoming Union budget.
However, the Congress, then headed by Rajiv Gandhi, withdrew support and the government fell, forcing a fresh general election. But not before it had presented its vote on account—keen readers can check for themselves that Sinha laid out the broad contours (including disinvestment of public sector equity) in their budget speech for that year.
So, when Rao found themselves as the PM, they were well aware of what had to be done. On advice, they picked Singh as the FM—a technocrat with a squeaky clean image; they were a breath of fresh air. Very cleverly, Rao, a politician, preferred to stay in the background, while they allowed their technocrat FM to grab the headlines.
In fact, it was Rao, who was holding the commerce portfolio, who announced a massive delicensing of industries (the centrepiece of the 1991 economic reforms agenda) on the morning of 24 July 1991. Later in the evening (then, the budget was presented at 5pm), Singh announced more measures, including the devaluation of the rupee. The next day's newspaper headlines combined the two stories, and the budget got precedence—as a result, Rao's role stood diminished.
So, yes, it is important to remember Rao, for the right reasons though. But for their firm backing of the FM, the acceleration in reforms may have been a non-starter. And this is no mean task as we have seen with the last regime. But it is entirely fallacious to credit Rao (or Singh for that matter) for authoring reforms. The duo implemented an existing blueprint. Give them credit for what is due.

'I guess I'm the biggest gago you've ever seen,' Jericho says before their WWE Manila match against Roman Reigns
Published 6:32 AM, September 10, 2016
MANILA, Philippines - Nearly 20 years after hitting the world stage, Chris Jericho is still making the towns for World Wrestling Entertainment. And, as they showed on Friday, September 9 at WWE Manila, he's still among the hardest workers in the business.
Jericho performed a heel master class in their match against Roman Reigns, doing their best to elicit boos from the nearly sold-out crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena for WWE's first live event in Manila in 7 years. Jericho entered wrapped in a scarf and looking smug as ever. Then they cut a scathing promo against the hometown fans which was intended to get fans to boo them and cheer Reigns.
"I haven't been to the Philippines for 8 years and I hope I don't have to come back for another 8 years because the Philippines stinks," said the Canadian Jericho, to which the crowd responded with "Du30" chants.
"The Philippines stinks man, and Manila is the anus."
Jericho then turned to one section of the crowd where a fan (or no one) called them a "gago," to which Jericho said "What did you just say? I'm a gago?" The crowd began to chant gago and were thoroughly in the hands of the multiple-time champion.
"Listen man, I don't know what a gago, but if you're calling me a gago, it must be a good thing," said Jericho. "I guess I'm the biggest gago you've ever seen.
"So shut up, sit down and let me do what I've gotta do so I can get out of here. Because tonight I'm gonna give you what you want, I'm gonna give you what you need. I'm gonna give you the gift of the greatest gago of all time. Drink it in maaaan."
Of course, gago is the equivalent of jerk in Tagalog, a fact which the referee later informs them of to great comedic effect.
Jericho's 5 minute heel promo did little to deter their admirers as they booed Reigns' entrance and chanted "Y2J" (Jericho's millennium-inspired nickname) throughout the match, which was an entertaining affair which ended with Reigns rolling through a roll-up pin attempt to hit their spear finisher.
The 45-year-old Jericho is doing some of the best work of their career playing the bad guy on screen, and their willingness to do whatever it takes to make the fans boo them and cheer their opponent is something young grapplers can benefit to learn from. Jericho's heel work wasn't over after the match, as they told local podcaster Romeo Moran to "Go jump in a lake, loser!"

If there were one thing fans wanted to boo about Jericho, it's that their new "Drink it in man" shirts weren't available for sale at the merchandise stand. Otherwise, Manila remains another pro-Jericho town. – Rappler.com
For somebody who put the polls above all else when it was good for him, Donald Trump hasn't uttered a whisper about their job approval ratings. After just a little over two months in office, Trump is dealing with some of the worst numbers of a newly elected President in the nation's history.
The Gallup poll has Trump languishing in the 30's but it doesn't get much better elsewhere. A new NBC/SurveyMonkey poll is out and it's not good news for Trump:
Meanwhile, Trump's job approval is at just 42 percent. A majority — 56 percent — disapprove of the job they are doing. Their net approval is now negative 14, down 3 points from negative 11 last month.
The bit of good news in the poll for Trump is a majority of Americans do want Neil Gorsuch to get a vote. This is on the heels of Democratic threats to filibuster the nomination:
A majority of Americans overall (54 percent) say that Senate Democrats should allow a vote on Gorsuch. Just 37 percent say they should not allow a vote. Democratic Senators have said they may filibuster Gorsuch in order to prevent a vote effectively leveraging their only opportunity to stop their appointment to the Supreme Court. While a sizable majority of Democrats, 64 percent, say that Senate Democrats should prevent a vote, 31 percent say they should allow a vote.
Even among Democrats, 30% think Gorsuch should get a vote.
If Trump had smart people around him, they could use this to their advantage. Trump should be out there now decrying any attempt to deny Gorsuch a vote. Instead, he's wasting time tweeting about Hillary Clinton.

So much for having a captive audience.
Though the quality of the games may not always be great, the NFL has enjoyed years of solid ratings on the fourth Thursday in November, because football and Thanksgiving have become inextricably intertwined. And because there's not really anything else on TV. (Also, having a game on the television gives family members who rarely get together an excuse for avoiding any and all awkward topics that otherwise may come up if they actually, you know, interact in a meaningful way.)
Last year, two of the Thanksgiving games gave the NFL an apples-to-apples win over the 2015 Thanksgiving games, creating the impression that the ratings woes from the election season had subsided. This year, the numbers went the other way, further fueling concerns that something is wrong — and that the NFL currently is incapable of fixing it on the fly.
Peter King of TheMMQB.com reviews the numbers generated by the Thanksgiving games from 2017, in comparison to the 2016 and 2015 contests.
For the early game in Detroit, Vikings-Lions generated a rating of 11.4. That's down 12.3 percent from last year's Vikings-Lions game, but only 7.3 percent down from Eagles-Lions in 2015.
The Cowboys game in the late-afternoon slot drew a 12.4 this year, with the Chargers serving as the opponent. That's 20.5-percent lower than last year's Washington-Dallas game and a 19.0-percent drop from Panthers-Cowboys two years ago.
The nightcap on NBC, featuring the two-win Giants and an uninspiring Washington team, churned out a 9.7 rating, down 10.2 percent from last year's sluggish Steelers-Colts game. In comparison to the Bears-Packers game from 2015, however, the drop was a dramatic 33.6 percent.
The NFL can continue to spin the numbers by pointing to reduced TV consumption or whatever else the league chooses to blame for the reality that people aren't watching football like they did only two years ago. Or the NFL can finally accept the fact that significant adjustments are needed in order to attract more viewers — and to hold more viewers.
One of those two strategies is viable.
Like a lot of other Americans, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to know why the Department of Justice hasn't criminally prosecuted any of the major players responsible for the 2008 financial crisis.
On Thursday, Warren released two highly provocative letters demanding some explanations. One is to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, requesting a review of how federal law enforcement managed to whiff on all 11 substantive criminal referrals submitted by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), a panel set up to examine the causes of the 2008 meltdown.
The other is to FBI Director James Comey, asking them to release all FBI investigations and deliberations related to those referrals. The FBI typically doesn't release investigative details about cases that the DOJ chooses not to pursue, but Warren pointed out that in releasing information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server in July, Comey had pretty much shattered that precedent and set a new one.
“You explained these actions by noting your view that ‘the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest,'” Warren wrote to Comey. “If Secretary Clinton's email server was of sufficient ‘interest' to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency.”
In other words, if Comey can spend hours relating FBI decision-making about State Department emails, they can do the same for the activity that made millions jobless and homeless.
The FCIC's criminal referrals, which were sent to the Justice Department in October 2010, have never been made public. But Warren's staff reviewed thousands of other documents released in March by the National Archives, including hearings and testimony, witness interviews, internal deliberations, and memoranda, and found descriptions and records of them.
They detail potential violations of securities laws by 14 different financial institutions: most of America's largest banks — Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual (now part of JPMorgan), and Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America) — along with foreign banking giants UBS, Credit Suisse, and Société Générale, auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, credit rating agency Moody's, insurance company AIG, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The FCIC presented the DOJ with evidence that these institutions gave false representations about the loan quality inside mortgage-backed securities; misled credit ratings agencies; overstated assets and earnings in financial disclosures; failed to disclose credit downgrades, subprime exposure, and the financial health of their operations to shareholders; and suffered breakdowns in internal company controls. All of these were tied to specific violations of federal law.
And the FCIC named names, specifying nine top-level executives who should be investigated on criminal charges: CEO Daniel Mudd and CFO Stephen Swad of Fannie Mae; CEO Martin Sullivan and CFO Stephen Bensinger of AIG; CEO Stan O'Neal and CFO Jeffrey Edwards of Merrill Lynch; and CEO Chuck Prince, CFO Gary Crittenden, and Board Chairman Robert Rubin of Citigroup.
None of the 14 financial firms listed in the referrals were criminally indicted or brought to trial, Warren writes. Only five of the 14 even paid fines in civil settlements. None of the nine named individuals were criminally prosecuted, and only one — Crittenden, of Citigroup — had to pay so much as a personal fine, for a mere $100,000.
Fannie Mae's Daniel Mudd recently reached a civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that imposed a fine of $100,000, but allowed Fannie Mae to pay it, rather than Mudd. It's not clear whether the others were even investigated. In March, Fortune magazine reported that Rubin “was never contacted by the Justice Department in relation to the commission's allegations.”
“Not every individual or company accused of a crime is guilty of that crime and not every DOJ referral results in a conviction,” Warren writes in their letter to the inspector general. “But the DOJ's failure to obtain any criminal convictions of any of the individuals or corporations named in the FCIC referrals suggests that the department has failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable. This failure requires an explanation.”
Warren has at least one ally on the House side. Just last week, Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., asked the FBI to publicly release case files relating to crisis-era investigations.
They also have support from Phil Angelides, the chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. “There's a gnawing feeling among the American people that this justice system may not have worked as it should have,” Angelides said in an interview with The Intercept. “Sen. Warren is right on and Americans have a right to know.”
Angelides said “I know as little as you know” about the criminal referrals they sent to the Justice Department. They stressed that it's not too late to prosecute on some activities, where the 10-year statute of limitations doesn't run out until 2017. But if nothing happens, they believe that financial institutions will internalize the message that they can continue to violate the law with impunity.
“It's like someone who robs a 7-11. If you can steal $1,000 and settle for $20 would you do it again? Probably.”
Read Warren's letter to Horowitz, which includes information on the specific criminal referrals:
UPON hearing that Microsoft would be buying the company behind the wildly popular Minecraft video game, 10-year-old Sabrina Lane had just one request: Don't mess it up, OK?
Lane published an open letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella titled “Dear Microsoft: Don't mess up Minecraft!” on Fortune.com Friday morning, amid rumours of the sale. While some fans called Minecraft's creator a sellout, Lane directed their attention to the game's new owners. Microsoft officially announced the purchase Monday morning.
“So I've heard the news that Microsoft might buy Minecraft, one of my favourite games. Kids like me — and teens — love the game, so I have a message for you and everyone at Microsoft: please don't change it!” they wrote.
“You can choose to play Minecraft in two different modes: “Creative” and “Survival.” The Creative mode lets you build anything you want (it's like being in the Lego Movie. You feel free as a bird — it's awesome). In Survival mode you have to earn your materials and fight with Creepers to survive. It's about risk-taking, and it's totally cool!
That's why Minecraft is perfect the way it is: You can choose to build any way you want, making amazing creations, or you can build like you're in the real world, and do amazing things.”
Sabrina, the daughter of Fortune Senior Editor Jennifer Reingold and Forbes Editor Randall Lane, has been an avid player of the game for over a year. Reingold told The Huffington Post that they and their colleagues were discussing the potential sale of Mojang, the company that owns Minecraft, to Microsoft at a recent editorial meeting when the staff realised that none of them played or knew much about Minecraft.
Knowing their daughter's enthusiasm for the game, Reingold decided to ask if they would be willing to write something for the magazine's website. Sabrina agreed, and they typed up the letter to Microsoft's CEO. Despite being professional editors, their parents refrained from making major changes. Reingold said their husband did break up a few sentences and fix a couple of typos.
“It was my first time writing like this, but I've learned how to organise paragraphs at school. You have to give a few reasons why you want it, so that's basically what I did,” Sabrina shared with HuffPost.
In the letter, Sabrina writes that they love the game because it's educational — a selling point they used to convince their parents to spend $6.99 on the app version.
“Minecraft is educational because you have to earn your stuff,” they write. “If you want milk, you milk a cow. If you want diamonds, you start mining, and maybe you'll be lucky enough to find some.”
Reingold said that they and their husband are “pretty restrictive” about what apps Sabrina can download and how often they can play. Minecraft impressed them because of how creative and open-ended the game can be, allowing players to build their own universe. That very open-endedness is one reason Reingold isn't hooked on the game, however.
“I have tried [playing the game] a little bit, but it's way beyond my creative and technological capacity as an older parent,” Reingold said.
The game has been a favourite of Sabrina's friends, both boys and girls, for more than a year — with the exception of someone named Ruth, whom Sabrina calls out in their letter. Don't fret, Sabrina's mum talked to Ruth's mum before the letter was published.
Sabrina said that they would continue to play Minecraft under the new owners, but they have to take a break right now since she's lost their iPod Touch.
“I can't find it anywhere. But hopefully I'll find it soon, and I'll play,” Sabrina said.

Image copyright Google Image caption Rabia Girls and Boys School was found to be "inadequate" in May 2014
An Islamic school is "undermining British values" and "limits girls to knitting and sewing" in technology classes, Ofsted inspectors say.
Rabia Girls and Boys School in Luton had "not met" standards needed for an independent school, the watchdog said.
Ofsted said the school practised "unequal treatment of girls and boys" and teaching quality was "inadequate".
The school said it was focused on "making the improvements needed to raise standards".
Rabia Girls School, based in Portland Road, was set up in 1995 as a single-sex independent private primary and secondary school in Luton.
It was the first Islamic school to open in the town and later became a joint boys and girls school due to increased demand.
But in May last year, Ofsted judged the school as "inadequate", while a follow-up visit in September 2014 said it still required improvement.
Unequal access
The inspection of May 2014 found pupils "were not taught a broad range of subjects in sufficient depth" and that girls "had too little career guidance", with their work experience placements limited to a nursery.
Despite some improvements, including the introduction of lessons in history and geography, the report said "the school's own work undermines the promotion of fundamental British values in its unequal treatment of girls and boys".
It said the balance between secular activities and Islamic studies differs between genders, with boys given more time to study national curriculum subjects.
The report, published on Monday, said older girls do not have the same opportunities to study science as "they do not have the same access to laboratory facilities that the boys have," while a newly introduced design and technology curriculum "limits girls to knitting and sewing".
The school currently caters for 269 five to 16 year olds.
A statement released on behalf of the Board of Governors and head teacher Mirza Akbar said the report had included "many positive comments".
It said the standards not met "were at the final stages of completion".
Asmodee Digital, a leader in digital board game entertainment today announced that the multi-million selling dungeon adventure card game, Munchkin, created and published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, will be reimagined for digital platforms, under license. The upcoming digital adaptation will put everything players love about Munchkin at their fingertips in the next year.
Designed by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic, Munchkin is the mega-hit card game about dungeon adventure… minus all that pesky roleplaying business. Friends compete to kill monsters and grab hilarious magic items, like the Horny Helmet, Boots of Butt-Kicking, Staff of Napalm, and Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. While their opponents are busy giggling, players are free to backstab friends, steal their stuff, grab the treasure and run!
Without the standard, long-winded RPG elements, Munchkin is not only fun and fast paced, it's easily one of the most accessible games of its genre.
“We are thrilled to partner with Asmodee Digital for the first adaptation of Munchkin to digital platforms. Munchkin has become an evergreen game over the years and we believe the time has come to offer fans around the world a truly innovative experience,” says Phil Reed, CEO of Steve Jackson Games.

For Father's Day, most stores stock displays with neckties, shades of blue, and snapshots of men cradling small children. I pass by cards with fishing reels, golf clubs, toolboxes, and sailboats. None of these apply to my family. The words “Dad,” “Daddy,” “Papa,” and “Father” pop out at me. I haven't called my father “Dad” in twenty-five years, not since they chose the name “Robin.”
Once they started to transition from man to woman, I learned to say their name in public instead of “Dad.” We told people that they were my Aunt, my father's sister. At times, I wondered if I might mistakenly say “Dad,” but I never did. For many years, Father's Day passed without any recognition. Why celebrate a day that didn't apply to us? She'd shed the word “Dad” along with their old name, so why should we recognize a day that etched the identity of “Father” so narrowly on crisply printed cards with the Hallmark logo?
More recently, I've started to recognize the day with a card or present. Usually my cards have flowers, shades of pink, or a striking photograph. This year, I sent one through “Paperless Post” with a funny New Yorker cartoon on which a man standing next to a litter box instructs their cat to “never think outside the box.” This is, of course, the opposite of what Robin has taught me. I found the card, not in the Father's Day section, but in the “just because” cards. I had to search for a while to find a card that fit.
I started to recognize the day to reclaim the relationship even if it didn't fit into the Hallmark mold. Years of saying “Aunt” and telling the world I was their niece wedged a gap that grew with time. Part of that distance was the fallout of divorce, but part of it was because we'd chosen to hide from the world, to try to fit into the mold. People accepted that they were my Aunt, but if I said “Dad,” and gestured to the tall, striking woman by my side, people would be confused. “Dad?”
When I send them cards today, it's a step towards telling the world that Dads don't all carry toolboxes and wear neckties. I know this is the case even with Dads who are men. Still, for that portion of the world whose fathers choose to walk through manhood into womanhood, this day still matters. We might have to choose blank cards off the rack, but we can fill them with our own words.
We can write our fathers' real names and say, on this day, let's celebrate the part you played in bringing me into this world and seeing me through the ups and downs of ordinary life. If we've been invisible in the past, maybe it's time to step out into the light and say out loud that there are different ways to be a “Dad.”

One day one headset will be able to do either Augmented or Virtual Reality at the click of a button and then Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality platform will be very well positioned to support this.
In a video promoting the platform Alex Kipman described new APIs with the Fall Creators Update which lets apps support both VR and AR with the same app, letting developers know for example if the screen is transparent or opaque or communicating the size of the physical space to developers so VR apps can ensure their content fits the space (something that is easier to do in AR).
Interestingly (and worryingly) Microsoft says they will not be rolling out the Fall Creators Update to the HoloLens, but warns:
While HoloLens isn't receiving an update with the release of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, know that work on HoloLens hasn't stopped; we'll have a lot of learnings and insight to apply from our recent work across Windows Mixed Reality as a whole. In fact, Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets and motion controllers represent a great entry point to development for HoloLens too, as the same APIs, tools, and concepts apply to both.
At present, it seems Microsoft is encouraging HoloLens developers to also support their new Windows Mixed Reality platform, and hopefully, the new APIs will make this somewhat easier.

Alex Salmond's former mentor today promised a “day of reckoning” for big business if Scots vote for independence including the nationalisation of BP, the break-up of the banks and a boycott of John Lewis.
Jim Sillars, who shared a campaign platform with the First Minister two days ago, accused large companies who have spoken out against separation this week of attempting to “subvert” the referendum through “lies and distortions”.
They said they were “in cahoots with a rich Tory Prime Minister” and warned nationalists would have their revenge if there is a Yes vote next Thursday.
The tirade by Mr Sillars, a former SNP deputy leader, came as a new YouGov opinion poll showed the Unionist campaign has regained the lead, by a margin of 52 per cent to 48 per cent, after a three-point swing to the No campaign since the weekend.
Senior nationalists are accusing Downing Street of a “dirty tricks campaign” by supposedly orchestrating the chorus of major employers who have spoken out against separation in recent days.
A letter is expected to be published this weekend in which more major retailers, including Marc Bolland, the chief executive of Marks and Spencer, will express their concern about independence and the impact it would have on prices.
Mr Sillars fell out with the First Minister for many years, becoming their most vocal nationalist critic, but they remained an SNP member and the two have reconciled during the campaign, speaking together at a major press event in Edinburgh on Wednesday.
Speaking in the Scottish capital today, they said: “This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks.

“The heads of these companies are rich men, in cahoots with a rich English Tory Prime Minister, to keep Scotland's poor, poorer through lies and distortions. The power they have now to subvert our democracy will come to an end with a Yes.”
They said BP will have to “learn the meaning of nationalisation” and if it wants access to “monster fields” off Shetland “it will have to learn to bend the knee to a greater power – us, the sovereign people of Scotland.”
“We will be the masters of the oilfields, not BP or any other of the majors,” they said, warning Bob Dudley, its chief executive, that this was not “mere rhetoric”.
Mr Sillars warned Scotland's bankers their “casino days” were over and their businesses would be split between their retail and investment sections, adding: “If your greed takes the latter down, there will be no rescue.”
New employment laws will force Standard Life to give two years' warning on redundancies, they said, meaning it could not follow through its plans to move savings, pensions and investment business to England.
They suggested Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairperson of the John Lewis Group, had taken “instructions from Cameron” when they warned this week that separation would lead to higher prices in Scotland.
“There is now talk of boycott, and if it happens it will be a management own goal. What kind of people do these companies think we are? They will find out,” they concluded.
Mr Salmond yesterday accused Standard Life, BP and Shell of colluding with David Cameron by issuing warnings about the impact of independence during the Prime Minister's visit to Scotland on Wednesday. The two oil giants backed expert warnings oil will all but have run out by 2050.
Five Scottish-based banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Tesco Bank, TSB and Clydesdale Bank – announced they would move their base to England if there is a Yes vote.
Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, and Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, have echoed Sir Charlie's warning separation would lead to higher prices north of the Border.
Adrian Grace, chief executive of insurance and pensions giant Aegon, told Radio Four's Today programme it may be “forced” to move staff from its Edinburgh base if the separatists win the referendum.
Sir Ian Cheshire, the chief executive of Kingfisher, which includes the B&Q and Screwfix DIY chains, is behind the letter that is expected to be published at the weekend.
Along with Mr Bolland, the other signatories are expected to include Mr Clarke and John Timpson, boss of the Timpson shoe repair business.
Sky News also reported that major telecoms companies were in talks about the implications of a Yes vote.
What to do about concussions?
March 19, 2014 by sportingjim
There is a lot of discussion about concussions in the world of primary care sports medicine.
Breaking news? Not!
But truly the conversation extends and deepens by the month, it seems to me. It might be my personal, professional myopia–during football season possibly 25% of the patients in my clinic are youth athletes with sport-related concussions (SRCs). As a consequence of that, I try to stay on top of the literature and have begun doing research in the area myself.
I hope you all have been as interested as I have over the March CJSM offerings in this area. The journal opens with an editorial, Time to Re-think the Zurich Guidelines? It continues with an interesting study looking at the use of those same guidelines along with the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test in determining return to play in adolescents following concussion.
And this blog has profiled the Zurich guidelines as well in a recent post and podcast, our first in what will be an on-going offering here at CJSM.
We are aware that there is much more to clinical sports medicine than concussion, and we make a concerted effort at the Editorial Board level to offer a continuing, rich, and diverse set of research focussed on the panoply of sport conditions we might see as clinicians. As we move forward, we are always interested hearing from you about areas in the world of clinical sport medicine that are of special interest to you.
You can comment on these pages, tweet us @cjsmonline, or if you are especially eager and want to take the bull by the horns: consider being a guest blog post writer for an issue that is of special interest to you. Our blog post guidelines can be found here and include instructions on how to contact us if you are interested.
In the meantime, take the poll here (offered concurrently on the CJSM main website). As you know, we love to hear from you!
Stevens will start their first Formula One race this weekend in Abu Dhabi.
The 23-year-old, who won two races in Formula Renault 3.5 this year, will partner Kamui Kobayashi at Caterham. The team signed Stevens last week but had to wait until today for their super licence to be confirmed.
Stevens was previously a member of Caterham's Racing Academy and tested for the team during the last two seasons. Following the change of management at Caterham earlier this year they joined Marussia as their official reserve driver.
“I'm absolutely thrilled to be getting this opportunity and am very grateful to everyone involved at Caterham F1 Team for giving it to me,” said Stevens.
“I feel ready for the challenge of my F1 debut and look forward to working as part of the team in a race environment after all the work we've done together previously in the tests I've completed and back at Leafield in the sim. Hopefully this will be something we will be able to carry through to the 2015 season together.”
Caterham's head of engineering operations Gianluca Pisanello said: “We know Will very well through their involvement in the Caterham Racing Academy and more importantly they have done a vast amount of time in our simulator, completing around 10,000km, which has built their experience both of this year's car and with the engineering team that are going to Abu Dhabi.”
“In addition, their 2014 test at Silverstone in our current car, where they completed over 500km, was very successful and their race pace was very good. As a result, they were one of our best candidates for this race weekend and we are delighted to have secured their services for our return to the F1 grid.
Stevens' most recent race victory came in the penultimate round of the Formula Renault 3.5 championship at Jerez. They ended the season sixth in the standings with Strakka Racing:

Controversial former Labor leader Mark Latham has waded into the US presidential election campaign, speaking out in defence of billionaire contender Donald Trump.
Writing for the Daily Telegraph, Latham on Tuesday lavished the Republican Party frontrunner with praise. They described the property mogul as a 'successful and down-to-earth' candidate with 'bold solutions' and the U.S. and Australia's best interests at heart.
'The Donald is by no means perfect but I much prefer their approach to the lying snakes of machine politics and media manipulation,' Latham wrote.

The former politician - who much like Trump, often finds themselves the centre of controversy - spoke glowingly of the Trump's 'anti-PC' attitude.
'Why shouldn't they support a successful, down-to-earth candidate who talks their language and shares their values?' they said of American voters.
Latham famously campaigned for Australia to withdraw its troops from Iraq during their failed 2004 federal election bid.
And in their column, they argued that a President Trump would not drag Australian servicemen into disastrous overseas conflicts like Iraq or Vietnam.
'Far from being a dangerous warmonger, Trump has a clear-headed appreciation of their country's best interests - and ours,' Latham wrote.
They also slammed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as a 'freak show', pointing out how they barked like a dog at a rally last month.

Mrs Clinton had been telling a crowd about a radio ad they heard where a dog barked every time someone lied when they brought out their best canine impression.
Latham resigned as a columnist for the Australian Financial Review recently after revelations they trolled prominent Australian women from a secret Twitter account.
Since leaving politics, they have authored several books and is a commentator for the Seven Network.
They recently returned to writing about social issues for News Corp newspapers although a foray into radio for broadcaster Triple M failed to get off the ground.
Lorenzo Alexander has been asked to do almost everything you can imagine in their 10-year NFL career. The former undrafted college free agent out of Cal has been a stalwart on every special teams unit for the four NFL teams for whom he's played. He's been urged to bulk up to 315 pounds try to stick with teams as a run stuffer, and he's been instructed to slim down to 235 pounds to try to play with more speed on the edge.
He's been a football vagabond, an easily coachable, team-first, do-anything contributor, bopping around the league on a series of one-year, veteran-minimum deals, fighting to make rosters with their special teams acumen and their willingness to fill in at any number of positions in the front seven. And then 2016 happened. Alexander was signed to be a role player -- forever a bubble guy -- in Buffalo, on another minimum salary benefit contract, hoping to extend their career through their early-30s on guts and guile and football intellect. Instead, after a series of injuries to Bills linebackers, they became one of the premier players in Rex Ryan's defense, a pass-rushing dynamo whose shocking career turn had them leading the NFL in sacks much of the season and now has them poised to be one of the most interesting and intriguing free agents in a weak 2017 class.
"You can't pigeonhole me, and people have always tried to do that. But every time they do I try to break the mold and show what I can do." -- Lorenzo Alexander
Few players have ever done what Alexander accomplished -- literally altering the entire complexion of their football profile at age 33, in yet another new and unfamiliar system. He's gone from a tweener defensive tackle/end to one of the most productive and consistent pass-rushing forces in the NFL. Few players have been asked to alter their bodies and adapt the way Alexander has, and after totaling 16 starts (12 of them coming all the way back in 2010) and nine sacks through the first nine years of their career, Alexander ended up starting all 16 games for the Bills and finishing tied for third in the league with 12.5 sacks. He's managed to get better with time in the world's most unforgiving team sport and now, finally, more than a decade into their self-made career, Alexander is now positioned for teams to have to adapt for him. With their newfound pass-rushing acumen another layer on top of their already renowned versatility, he's in line for what will be by far the biggest pay day of their NFL career (and probably their final bite at that financial apple as well).
This is certainly unprecedented terrain for Alexander, who will turn 34 in May, but when you have been through all they have, maintaining perspective come easily. Alexander, who has been a staple in the community everywhere they have played and whose devotion to charity work has defined them since early in their career, has tried to follow the advice Joe Gibbs gave them back in 2006, when Alexander was finally added to an NFL active roster after bouncing around on practice squads.
Lorenzo Alexander came out of nowhere in 2016 to nearly lead the NFL in sacks. USATSI
"Your role can change drastically from week to week, and within games," Alexander said. "So you always have to be ready, and I've always tried to make sure that I was that guy who the coach could trust if called on to do whatever they had to do for the team. I was taught that a long time ago by coach Gibbs. They told me the best guys don't always last the longest, it's the guys you trust who end up sticking around."
Alexander was signed out of Cal by the Panthers in 2005, who envisioned them as a 4-3 defensive tackle, and they were back on their practice squad the following year, then released. Alexander spent about a week on Baltimore's practice squad before they were signed by Washington, where they would stay until 2012, when they signed with Arizona. Alexander was quickly welcomed by coaches and veteran players in Washington for their attitude, work ethic and personality, and they would become a fan favorite as well and pillar in the community. They still reside in Virginia and does the bulk of their charity work there as well as Oakland, where they were born and raised.
Much of Alexander's longevity is attributable to their special teams ability, where they remain a standout on punts and kickoffs and on the punt return units. Their exceptional breakout season in Buffalo didn't change any of that, and Alexander remains committed to contributing on those units wherever they land in free agency. The Bills are interested in retaining him, but since they signed a minimum salary benefit deal, they have no exclusive negotiating rights to them and they cannot sign with any team until the 2017 league year begins next month.
Alexander signed with the Bills with almost no expectations, and ended up putting together an All Pro season at another new position.
"My role was going to be a special teams ace and to rotate in with all the packages and things I could on third down," Alexander said, "and to give some versatility. That was what Rex had planned out, and I was all up for that."
Instead, Alexander ended up starting as an outside linebacker with rookie Shaq Lawson injured for the offseason and much of the regular season, and seven games into the season Alexander had already matched their career high with nine sacks (with at least a half-sack in seven straight games). They were virtually un-blockable in some games and the rare bright spot on a wilting Bills' defense that resulted in Ryan being fired with one game to play.
"I think I've always had the ability to rush the passer," Alexander said this weekend, already well into their offseason routine which starts quickly after the season with Pilates and stretching. "I don't think I'm a natural pass rusher, and I'm not a guy with the skill set of Von Miller and Khalil Mack. I need volume, and most guys need volume, because we aren't as fast as some of those guys and we've got to set the tackle up and we go against some pretty good, very athletic tackles. So it takes three quarters sometimes to set a guy up, and this was really my first time to have opportunity to be on the field for that amount of time to do it."
In Washington, bookend pass rushers Brian Orakpo and Ryan Kerrigan were ahead of Alexander on the depth chart and they were bounced around the defensive line. Their time in Arizona -- the only place they made more than the veteran minimum, earning $2 million one season -- was cut after playing just three games in their first season there because of injury. And a homecoming with the Raiders in 2015 lasted just one season (privately, some on that staff have grumbled that they should have found a way to deploy Alexander differently to complement Mack).
The Bills guaranteed Alexander just $75,000 of their $885,000 one-year salary in what turned out to be one of their rare recent personnel forays to prove fruitful. But even now that could backfire because of the timing of Alexander's monster season and the mounting free-agent interest. They very well may have led the NFL in sacks had the Bills not shifted their role, yet again, to more of a stack linebacker position late in the season, needing to sell out to stop the run after being gouged on the ground all season long. In that role they took up space to allow Lawson and Jerry Hughes to make plays off the edge.
Alexander isn't fixated on stats -- he's never been that kind of guy so no reason to fall prey to it now -- or scheme fit, as they will be attractive to various teams in free agency.
"I'm a football player," Alexander said. "I play off the ball as a stack linebacker, and I play on the line of scrimmage as an outside defensive end, and have good film at both positions ... I'm excited about what the future brings. I'm a throwback football player. You can't pigeonhole me, and people have always tried to do that. But every time they do I try to break the mold and show what I can do."
The prospects for Alexander should be ripe. Washington is dead set on adding to its defensive front, and San Francisco is doing the same. Staying close to home would be big for Alexander. There is also Cleveland, where their former defensive coordinator in Washington, Gregg Williams, is trying to rebuild that sad sack unit from scratch and will need veterans to help embody and teach their complicated scheme to that young roster.
Of course, finding a comparable player -- to have this kind of signature pass rush season at this stage of their career -- isn't particularly easy. Alexander's agent, Peter Schaffer, surmised their client will land "between $5 million and $10 million per year" on a short-term free agent deal, understanding this is a unique case which explains that wide range.
Back in 2010 (eons ago in NFL contract years), for instance, John Abraham was making $7M after their tenth season coming off a double-digit sack season. In 2014, an aging Jared Allen was making $8M in a year in which they registered just 5.5 sacks. Of course, those players had a more established rushing pedigree, but then again this free-agent class is utterly lacking in that commodity and Alexander made it happen last year despite a suspect cast around them and with the coaching staff under extreme duress.
Alexander vows to work harder than ever this offseason -- they concede, ever their own worst critic -- that they may have taken a few too many rare days off and done too many personal appearances in 2012, the last time there was a modicum of outside interest in him. They also believe the additional speed and agility when they play at 235 pounds is an advantage, and ideally he'd find a home playing at that weight in 2017. Given how he's evolved since then, this will be an unusual situation for him, with more teams and more money on the table as the signing period approaches. Besides working out, he'll spend time with their family and continue their aggressive outreach -- I ran into them on the National Mall last July 4 for a huge fundraiser and day of activities for TAPS (the Tragedy Assistance Programs for Survivors) families who have lost loved ones in service to the military.
By the time they attend their next charity event for their foundation -- a bowling fundraiser in Oakland in April (www.lorenzoalexander.org) they stand to be a much richer man. How rich, will be one of the more unusual test-cases for NFL free agency, but Alexander already learned long ago to enjoy the ride beyond the paychecks.
"We'll just go into March and figure things out then," Alexander said. "The last couple of years I've been on the other end of the spectrum, with one or two teams interested, and it's much easier when it's like that because the money is pretty much the same and the roles are all the same. So it's a harder decision when you have a bigger marker. I'm just praying that it's an easy decision, and it all works out. We'll see when it comes time to sign."
London: Muammar Gaddafi is believed to be hiding near the western town of Ghadamis near the Algerian border under the protection of Tawareq tribesmen, a senior Libyan military official said.
"One tribe, the Tawareq, is still supporting them and they are believed to be in the Ghadamis area in the south," Hisham Buhagiar, a senior military official of the Libya's new leadership, told Reuters by telephone late on Tuesday.
Buhagiar, coordinator of the hunt for Gaddafi, said the ousted Libyan leader was believed to have been in the southern town of Samnu a week ago before moving to Ghadamis, which lies 550 km (345 miles) southwest of Tripoli.
They said Gaddafi's son Saif Al Islam was in Bani Walid and another son, Mutassem, was in Sirte, the family's home town.
"They are both thinking about leaving Libya maybe to Niger," Buhagiar added.
Sirte, one of the last bastions of support for Gaddafi, is encircled by forces of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council (NTC) and under bombardment from NATO warplanes.
Taking Sirte, 450 km east of Tripoli, would bring the NTC closer to gaining control of the whole country, a goal that has eluded it more than a month after its fighters seized the capital.
Buhagiar said most tribes in the south were against Gaddafi except for the Tawareq, who still supported him.
"There has been a fight between Tawareq tribesmen who are loyal to Gaddafi and Arabs living there (in the south). We are negotiating. The Gaddafi search is taking a different course," Buhagiar said, without elaborating.
Gaddafi's daughter Aisha, their brothers Hannibal and Mohammed, their mother Safia and several other family members fled to Algeria in August and have lived there since.
A construction worker walked past steel beams inside the structure that will house an iron ore induration machine near Nashwauk, Minn.
After nine years of financing and construction delays, Minnesota's first modern taconite operation is nearly complete. But this summer's ribbon-cutting won't be all smiles and ice cream.
While Iron Range leaders are happy about the jobs and investment, falling ore prices and lowered expectations are dampening enthusiasm for the $2 billion Essar Steel project.
With recent layoffs at nearby taconite plants, some Rangers are anxious for the global steel industry to rebound and unsure about Essar's commitment given that the firm has shelved plans to build a steel factory to accompany its ore plant.
Essar officials say they're in for the long-haul on taconite but that constructing the steel plant would not have been feasible. The shift, however, remains a sore point for some lawmakers.
The state kicked in $66 million in infrastructure grants based on the promise of a steel plant that didn't happen, said Rep. Tom Anzelc, DFL-Balsam Township.
"This was an extraordinary company with an extraordinary idea," said Anzelc. "We built a railroad. The public built an electric substation, brought in the gas and electric. It was with great fanfare and excitement that all that was done. Jobs were beginning to be created."

Leaders of India-based Essar say there will be plenty to celebrate. Some 300 construction workers are erecting several huge steel buildings at what will be the Iron Range's first new taconite operation in 40 years. That will peak to 800 by this summer.
The plant will boast 350 full-time jobs averaging $85,000 a year and provide tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue for decades, said Essar Steel Minnesota CEO Madhu Vuppuluri.
It will be one of the cleanest, most efficient, and lowest cost ore operations in North America, they added. "It has been quite a road. This project has been project on paper for almost 20 years, so we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now."
The steel plant is not off the table completely, but the $66 million in state grants to Essar were given on the belief the company would complete construction of a steel mill by October. The company has asked the state for a seven-year extension to build the plant, saying it's still in their long-term plans.
But several Iron Range legislators, say that's unlikely.
"I don't think that's in the cards right now," said state Sen. David Tomassoni, DFL-Chisholm. "I think that they need to get the place built, and I think they need to pay it back."
Essar struggled to raise the $1.9 billion needed just for the mine and taconite pellet plant. In 2012 and 2013 construction stalled when the company was unable to pay its contractors. Vupuluri says work resumed late last year when Essar secured its last $800 million in financing. But now steel demand in the U.S. is slumping.
An oversupply of iron ore and steel has led U.S. Steel to announce the layoffs of about 400 workers at nearby Keewatin Taconite. A company called Magnetation is closing an iron ore plant, also in Keewatin, that employs 50 people.

Vuppuluri calls those layoffs unfortunate, but says he's not concerned for Essar, which is banking on a growing appetite for steel in North America to replace aging airports, bridges and other infrastructure.
Despite the glut of steel and low demand, College of St. Scholastica economist Tony Barrett believes the taconite market will rebound with the changing business cycles.
"We need the steel capacity that we have," Barrett said.
That's what Essar and the Iron Range hope.
The Essar jobs are huge for the region and will mean the difference between Neshwauk surviving and thriving, said Mayor Ben DeNucci, who squeezes in politics between their day job at Keewatin Auto Repair and the bar they own in Neshwauk.
"There are contracted workers working there that I know, that I've gone to high school with, that I'm on the fire department with, that I play softball with in the summertime," DeNucci said, "so those jobs are great, they're important."
The mine, they added, will be worth the nine-year wait.
Nothing like this was supposed to be in the campaign cards. Touted from the outset as the closest race ever among the three main federal parties, an up-for-grabs contest bound to result in a minority government, Canada's 42nd general election turned into a Liberal triumph on a scale no sensible pollster or pundit would have dared predict. Justin Trudeau will now become Canada's 23rd prime minister, leading an unexpected majority government.
For Stephen Harper, all hope vanished on the battleground where they secured their surprise 2011 Conservative majority—and where Tory strategists had banked on them again dominating in 2015—the great massing of 55 ridings in and, especially, around Toronto. And so the driving force behind the deal to unite the fractured Canadian right in 2003 leaves the Tory leadership after nearly a decade as Prime Minister.
As election results rolled in from east to west, sizeable Liberal gains that had been widely predicted on the East Coast turned into an outright sweep, as the party won all 32 Atlantic province ridings. It was a harbinger. In Quebec, the Liberals made strides beyond any mainstream forecast. But only when the votes were tallied in Toronto, and its surrounding suburbs, was it finally undeniable that Tory losses would be much too severe, and Liberal victories far too abundant, for Harper to imagine clinging to power.
It was left to voters across the Prairies and British Columbia to convert what was already at least a solid Liberal minority win into a resounding majority. Justin Trudeau will become prime minister, as their father Pierre Trudeau was before him, with Liberal MPs occupying, according to the count in the early morning hours, at least 184 of the 338 seats in the newly expanded House of Commons.
It was in Toronto, way back on Aug. 4, that Harper announced their first key promise of the campaign: a 15 per cent tax credit on home renovations between $1,000 and $5,000. They did it at a tile store in Eglinton–Lawrence, the riding held by Joe Oliver, their finance minister. Eleven weeks later, Oliver was unseated by a Liberal, along with a raft of other Toronto-area Tory and NDP incumbents, and nobody remembered that reno tax break.
Yet offering homeowners money for fixing up their houses looked, at first, like a classic Harper-era Conservative gambit. A succinct policy message, easily understood, aimed at the self-interested heart of the voting middle-class. In 2015, though, with about 60 per cent of Canadians telling pollsters they were hungering for change, the familiar Tory reliance on niche pocketbook policy offerings utterly failed to work its old magic.
Even less fruitful was Harper's mid-campaign bid to shift the debate to identity issues, especially their government's polarizing policies on banning the niqab from citizenship ceremonies and stripping the Canadian citizenship of dual nationals convicted of terrorism.
Trudeau stoutly opposed Harper on both these values-laden issues. The popular verdict? A poll late in the campaign by Abacus Data for Maclean's found that those voters most concerned about their government's values were more than twice as likely to support the Liberals as the Tories.
More broadly, however, Trudeau ran on the catch-all slogan “Real change now.” After nearly a decade of the Harper government, voters evidently liked the sound of that. Voters knocked the Michael Ignatieff-led Grits down to a humiliating third place in 2011; they lifted Trudeau's overhauled Liberals back to the party's accustomed 20th-century position of dominance.
Reduced to about 102 MPs, the Conservatives now enter a difficult rebuilding phase, without Harper. Although they didn't mention their resignation in their election-night speech, their party announced that a leadership contest is on the way. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair, who started the campaign with the polling lead, and perhaps ran too cautiously to hold it, saw their party relegated, with only about 42 MPs, to its traditional position trailing the Liberals and Tories.
In their first national campaign as leader, Trudeau's performance was almost impossible to fault. They ran on a carefully calibrated Liberal platform, which promised a middle-income tax break (offset by a hike on earnings over $200,000); bigger federal support cheques to most parents; and three years of deficit spending to inject vigour into a listless economy.
Their assertive, expectation-exceeding performances through five televised debates—starting Aug. 6 at one hosted by Maclean's in Toronto—made the tag line from the Tory attack ads—“Justin Trudeau is just not ready”—ring hollow.
Their rallies rocked. Their stump speech delivery steadily improved. Their athletic good looks made them appear even younger than their 43 years. At six foot two, they often gave the impression they were floating just above the adoring throngs, providing the Liberal machine with a steady stream of compelling footage from the hustings to edit into YouTube videos and TV ads. But no image will be as indelible as the one they created while delivering their victory speech in Montreal.
“Canadians chose change—real change,” they told an ecstatic partisan crowd, their voice finally grown hoarse after 78 days of tireless campaigning. “This is what positive politics can do. This is what a positive, hopeful vision and a platform and a team can make happen.”
In Calgary, their adopted hometown, Harper had to hope their concession speech would begin to dispel the bad odour of late-campaign desperation ploys, especially their appearances at two Toronto campaign events with Rob Ford, the city's internationally ridiculed former mayor.
“The people of Canada have elected a Liberal government, a result that we accept without hesitation,” they said. But Harper also spoke of their pride in the Conservative policy record, especially on the economy and foreign affairs. And, perhaps alluding to the more controversial parts of their campaign, they declared: “We gave everything we have to give and we have no regrets whatsoever.”
For Harper, federal politics has come full circle in a way that must feel almost cruelly ironic. They have written forcefully in the past about being first drawn as a young man to Conservative politics by anger over the policies—especially the National Energy Program—and political style of Pierre Trudeau, Justin's father.
Mulcair didn't lapse in the campaign's late stages into the sort of dubious tactics Harper tried. Still, Trudeau's relentless rise must have tested the famously intense NDP leader's composure. Their party led in the polls from Aug. 2, when Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall to officially start the campaign, until Sept. 21, when the Liberals passed the NDP for good.
The real watershed in that contest arguably came between Aug. 25, when Mulcair promised that as prime minister they would balance the books, and Aug. 27, when Trudeau declared that they would run three years of deficits. That gamble paid off by allowing the Liberals to differentiate themselves to progressive voters as more willing than New Democrats to spend to usher in change.
In their concession speech in Montreal, Mulciar said Trudeau “made ambitious commitments to Canadians, and Canadians will have high expectations for the next Parliament.” Despite the NDP falling far back from the high-water mark it set in 2011 under the late Jack Layton, Mulcair cast the election as a sort of moral victory. “Canadians have turned the page,” they said, “on 10 long years, and have rejected the politics of fear and division.”
Beyond the decisive swing in Ontario, where the Liberals won a commanding 79 of 121 seats, the political map changed dramatically across the country. In Quebec, the Liberals won 48 of 78 ridings. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, they took nine, up from just two in 2011, of 28 seats in the two provinces. Trudeau will even have two MPs from Alberta, the Tory heartland, up from zilch. In B.C., Liberals took 17 of 42 seats. (All these totals were from Elections Canada around midnight, when they were still shifting slightly.)
Many major figures from the Tory and NDP ranks lost their seats. Bad news set in for the NDP when the party's popular deputy leader, Megan Leslie, was defeated in Halifax. In Ontario, along with Joe Oliver falling, Chris Alexander, Harper's hard-hitting citizenship minister, was beaten by Mark Holland, the Liberal they had ousted in 2011. As for the Liberals, among the many winners are only a few cabinet stalwarts of the old Jean Chretien and Paul Martin governments, but veteran John McCallum was re-elected near Toronto, along with Ralph Goodale in Saskatchewan.
A thorough changing of the guard is now in order in official Ottawa. Trudeau decided to enter politics in 2006 after they backed Toronto Liberal Gerard Kennedy's failed bid for the party's leadership. Among Trudeau's top strategists are veterans of Kennedy's team, experienced in Ontario provincial politics, but still quite young, notably Gerald Butts, 44, their ever-present best friend and top adviser, and Katie Telford, 37, their campaign chief. They thanked them both in their victory speech.
Exactly when Trudeau will reconvene the House is not yet clear. But they have said their first order of business will be to pass a bill to cut the tax rate on incomes of between $44,700 and $89,401, for a saving at tax time of up to $670.
One of their biggest promises hasn't really received much attention: Trudeau vows to convene an all-party committee to review new ways of electing MPs, such as ranked ballots, on which voters would list their picks in order of preference, and proportional representation, which would guarantee parties a share of seats closer to their share of the popular vote.
Trudeau pledged that within 18 months, their government will get rid of the familiar “first past the post” system, in which all that matters is which candidate earns the most votes in each riding, and enact some sort of reform.
In other words, they vow that the very democratic mechanism that gave them their victory tonight, and handed Harper such a terrible defeat, will be no more. If they make good on that promise, whatever else the election of 2015 was, it will go down, for Canadian voters, as the last of its kind.
The Clearwater Threshers saw a four-game winning streak come to an end on Monday, as the Threshers were held off the board in a 5-0 loss to the Jupiter Hammerheads at Roger Dean Stadium.
After outscoring Jupiter 19-1 in the first three games of the series, the Threshers (7-5) were limited to six hits in the series finale.
Cord Sandberg, Carlos Tocci, and Kyle Martin each singled twice, while Jairo Munoz and Joey DeNato combined for 3.1 scoreless innings of relief.
Jupiter (4-8) struck for three runs against starter Will Morris (0-1) in the first inning.
Three consecutive singles by Dexter Kjerstad, Brian Schales, and Brian Anderson loaded the bases with nobody out, and Taylor Ard followed with a line drive single to left. Kjerstad scored on the base hit, while Schales and Anderson crossed on a throwing error by Sandberg in left.
The Hammerheads added another in the third on an RBI groundout by KJ Woods, scoring Schales to make it 4-0 Jupiter. The final tally came across in the fifth on Brad Haynal's RBI single.
Morris would ultimately be charged with five runs - three earned - on nine hits and a walk across 4.2 innings.
Threshers pitchers faced the minimum the rest of the way.
John Norwood singled to start the sixth, but Munoz promptly picked them off first base. In the eighth, Yuniel Ramirez reached on a two-out error by Mitch Walding but was picked off by DeNato to end the inning.
Clearwater returns home to Bright House Field to open up a six-game home stand beginning on Tuesday, as the Threshers welcome in the Daytona Tortugas for a three-game set.
Thomas Eshelman (0-1) toes the rubber against Daytona's Keury Mella (0-2), with first pitch scheduled for 7 p.m. on Dollar Tuesday, presented by Regions Bank. The call can be heard live on the Threshers Broadcast Network beginning at 6:45 p.m.
A change to regulations to retain a big engine fin was discussed at this month's F1 Strategy Group meeting.
But despite extensive work had been put into the regulation, and teams planning their 2018 cars with that in mind, McLaren failed to back the proposal.
It wanted a smaller version introduced instead and, as unanimous support was needed for a change, talks began on a compromise solution.
But with time marching, a decision was made at this week's technical regulations meeting to remove it completely.
"It's going to complicate matters slightly," said Force India technical director Andrew Green. "It means we have to redevelop part of the cars which hasn't been developed because we assumed the engine cover was going to say the same.
"Now it's not so we have to redevelop parts of the car accordingly. It's not a big thing but it's still something we have to do that we didn't think we would have to do."
McLaren racing director Eric Boullier defended their team's position, saying it followed the regulations as they were currently written.
"I don't understand why everyone went to do something else other than the regulations," they said. "It has been voted months ago to go with no shark fin – a sort of mini shark fin.
"This is in the regulations for next year. Some teams believed it will change again, and wanted to keep the big fin.
"Then it was discussed to have a Mercedes style fin and in the end we just remind everybody what was voted six months ago. People have said: 'We have to change it, we've worked in the wind tunnel.'
"No problem, but you know regulations. There is no debate. So that is it."

Queen Anne
1664-1714
On 4th May, 1702, England declared war against France. Churchill, leading the Queen's troops, experienced early successes in the war and was rewarded by being created Duke of Marlborough. They went on to gain a historic victory over the French at Blenheim in Bavaria. Anne held a thanksgiving service at St. Paul's and granting them the royal estate at Woodstock and ordered Blenheim Palace built on the site at the expense of the nation. A Further victory followed at Ramillies in Flanders.
Louis XIV consequently gave aid to Anne's Catholic half-brother, and claimant to their throne, James Francis Edward. A French fleet was assembled at Dunkirk in 1708. Whilst meeting with their Council to discuss the matter, the question of whether James should be executed if taken prisoner was raised, Anne became so moved and emotionally upset that they could not carry on with the meeting. James unfortunately came down with measles just as their fleet was about to set sail, the threat was removed and the French fleet chased north.
SARAH CHURCHILL
Sarah Churchill, always a quarrelsome woman, was growing increasingly jealous and at times vehement at Anne's growing attachment to their cousin, Lady Masham. Marlborough, a gifted general, won a further victory against the French at Oudenarde and entered France, capturing Lille, they went on to gain a further resounding victory over Louis XIV at Malplaquet.
Sarah's now stormy relationship with Anne, however, was growing successively more strained. On the way to the Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul's to celebrate the victory of Oudenarde, Sarah provoked an embarrassing public scene, which culminated in them audaciously telling the Queen to "be quiet" on the steps of the Cathedral. Anne could not forgive this public humiliation and it widened the breech between them into a gaping chasm.
Although the crowns of England and Scotland had been united in the person of James I, they had continued to retain their own separate Parliaments. In 1707, both the English and Scottish Parliaments passed the twin Acts of Union, creating the joint kingdom of Great Britain. The act was not popular in Scotland.
George of Denmark fell seriously ill in October, 1708. Sarah visited Anne and was with them when their husband died to offer their support. Queen Anne was devastated. Sarah, true to character, untactfully continued to raise old quarrels with the grieving Queen and would not let the matter rest. Anne's patience with the fractious Sarah was wearing very thin.
Sarah wrote requesting an audience, the Queen, trying to avoid the dreaded ordeal of another meeting with her, wrote that they would be unable to see them until after Easter. Undeterred, Sarah arrived before Easter and characteristically proceeded to bring up a matter of contention, Anne had had enough, the two were never to meet again. At the end of the war the great Marlborough was dismissed from office. It was a poor reward for the services they had rendered their country and the Queen.
THE FINAL YEARS
As Anne entered the final years of their reign and their health declined, the issue of who should succeed them on the thrones of England and Scotland became of mounting importance. Anne personally disliked the Hanoverians, whom the succession had been settled on by Act of Parliament. Sophia of Hanover's son, George, had at one point been sent to England as a prospective suitor for Anne's hand, but after meeting them failed to propose, Anne could not forget this stinging insult to their feminine pride.
It was suspected that Anne naturally preferred the claims of their half-brother, James, known as the Pretender. The Queen themselves fueled such rumours by refusing to allow any of Sophia of Hanover's family to reside in England. In 1712 Anne received a letter from the brother they had never met, asking them to 'prefer your own brother, the last of our line,' they received no reply but they refused to countenance the suggestion of Parliament's putting a price on their head.
When Sophia of Hanover wrote to request that their grandson might take up their position in the House of Lords, Anne's response was furious. Them letter to Sophia was cold and dismissive. Sophia, whose greatest wish was said to have had 'Sophia, Queen of Great Britain' inscribed on their tomb, narrowly missed their ambition when they died suddenly at Hanover just a few months before Queen Anne on 8th June 1714. On 27th July Anne finally decided in favour of the Hanoverian succession.
At half past seven in the morning of 1st August, 1714, England's last Stuart monarch, now vastly obese and ailing, died at Kensington Palace. Arbuthnot wrote "sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her." The Queen's body was so swollen with dropsy at their death that they had to be interred in a vast, square shaped coffin. They were buried beside their husband George of Denmark at Westminster Abbey and was succeeded by George I, the first of the House of Hanover.

Criminal Charges May be Filed in California
After filing their complaint with the FPPC, Karger also asked the California State Attorney General, the Sacramento County District Attorney and District Attorney-elect to consider criminal charges against NOM and Privacy for All Students (PFAS) if the FPPC went ahead with an investigation. Under California election law, if a committee like the one NOM sponsored to repeal AB 1266 violated state election law with “intent,” it could well be a criminal offense and NOM leaders could face even stiffer penalties.

NOM is the largest anti-LGBT organization in the country.On October 1, 2014, Karger filed their sworn complaint with the FPPC, which investigates violations of the California Political Reform Act and is similar to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The complaint was against NOM head Brian Brown, NOM's Political Director, Sacramento based Frank Schubert and the campaign committee sponsored by NOM, “Privacy for all Students - Stop AB 1266.” In the 35 page complaint, Karger charged them with violating California election law by not reporting the source of their funds or their expenditures when they attempted to qualify a referendum last year. NOM fell 17,000 signatures short of qualification in its expensive effort to repeal AB 1266, authored by State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano and signed by Governor Jerry Brown.After the compliant was filed, the FPPC went to NOM and the other major backers of the referendum to get their response to the charges.

When I travel to Asia, I'm fairly often met at the airport by someone holding a sign reading “Mr. Paul.” Why? In much of Asia, names are given family first, personal second — at home, the prime minister of Japan is referred to as Abe Shinzo. And the mistake is completely forgivable when it's made by a taxi driver picking up a professor.
It's not so forgivable, however, if the president of the United States makes the same mistake when welcoming the leader of one of our most important economic and security partners. But there it was: Donald Trump referring to Mr. Abe as, yes, Prime Minister Shinzo.
Mr. Abe did not, as far as we know, respond by calling their host President Donald.
Trivial? Well, it would be if it were an isolated instance. But it isn't. What we've seen instead over the past three weeks is an awesome display of raw ignorance on every front. Worse, there's no hint that either the White House or its allies in Congress see this as a problem. They appear to believe that expertise, or even basic familiarity with a subject, is for wimps; ignorance is strength.
We see this on legal matters: In a widely quoted analysis, the legal expert Benjamin Wittes described the infamous executive order on refugees as “malevolence tempered by incompetence,” and noted that the order reads “as if it was not reviewed by competent counsel at all” — which is a good way to lose in court.
It is being billed as a ground-breaking social experiment building a new community “in the wilderness”, in a “remote and isolated part of the northern hemisphere.”
But participants in Channel 4's forthcoming survival series set on the northern side of Ardnamurchan Peninsula, could easily walk to the pub for a pint of craft ale and within an hour or so, or pick up newly baked bread at the local bakery.
KEO films have been commissioned by the broadcaster and have already been casting for “skilled Brits.”
It adds they can be “..everyone from fishermen to foragers, builders to botanists, engineers to entertainers. Or simply those who seek adventure or escape.”
The big budget series, originally had the working title Eden but that has been changed to Year Zero.
The 20 men and women will be filmed round the clock as they strive to achieve self-sufficiency, hunting/fishing for food as well as basic horticulture.
They will have to build places to shelter, in the face of the elements.
They will settle an area around the dunes and beach at Cul na Croise and the nearby woodland.
A close boarded fence almost six feet high was erected to protect the site, but if it is keeping out the public a temporary suspension of access rights will be needed.
A Scottish Government spokesperson said Highland Council had applied for one, but this had prompted a number of queries. "Scottish Ministers have therefore not yet made a decision,” they said.
This and other environmental issues have been the subject of some local criticism, not least the impact on local wildlife, recreation and tourism. But others see the commercial potential of having film crews based locally for a year.
However the promotion of the series as being set in a remote wilderness has raised a few eyebrows.
One local woman who didn't want to be named said “There is a good track along to a car park and then then the road takes you to the village of Acharacle. It is perhaps a distance of three or four miles, easily walkable.”
Another man said “I don't know what they are going to do if somebody tries to make a break for freedom and gets over to Acharacle for a drink; or if somebody tries to get into the site.”
Another woman said they not want to be quoted as “It is a bit controversial here. Some are for it some are against it.”
Dr Michael Foxley, the former leader of the Highland Council who for many years was the local councillor for Ardnamurchan said they had known the area well from their youth. “The sands are very popular picnic area for the village of Acharacle which is not very far away. In Acharacle there is a primary school, a GP surgery, a garage, a shop, bakery, hotel and bar, teashop and other tourism businesses. So the idea that somehow they are going to be in a wilderness far removed from civilisation, is absolutely absurd. The township of Arrivegaig is even closer. I just hope the community gets something out of it all,” they said.
The Herald asked KEO Films about the portrayal of the location as remote wilderness.
A spokesperson responded: “Filming on the programme is yet to commence.
“Channel 4 has confirmed the commission of an epic new series from KEO Films. Beginning in 2016 the series will follow the experience of more than 20 highly skilled Brits as they face building a new life - creating their own shelter, society and rules. For one year this community will hunt, sleep and live together, cut off from the rest of the world.
They said the series would challenge "everything about modern living."
It follows in the footsteps of Castaway 2000, which was filmed on the island of Taransay off Harris. Over 30 tried to build a community from their provided eco-pods. But their progress was marked by controversy much caught on film.
In 1975 journalist James Hogg spent two weeks on the uninhabited island Garbh Eilach, south of Oban, for BBC magazine programme Nationwide.
They were equipped only with a machete, some wire and an afternoon's training by the RAF. They had to build their own shelter and feed himself. By the end of the fortnight they were reported to be in very poor medical and psychological state.
On Tuesday, Ron Johnson, the captain of the Missouri Highway Patrol, blamed the media for “glamorizing” and giving a platform to violent thugs intent on causing violence and agitating crowds in Ferguson, Missouri.
In an appearance on MSNBC's Daily Rundown after another night of rioting and confrontations, Johnson told host Craig Melvin that “we have a lot of media that have not done a great job” and made the situation worse–and tougher for police. They said that on Monday evening, when small crowds started to swell in size, “that criminal element, that got out here with masks on, that wanted to agitate and build up the crowd, would stop in front of the media.”
“The media would swarm around them, give them a platform and glamorize their activity,” Johnson said. “The crowd would stop. And then before we knew it, the crowd is 100, now it's 200, now it's 300. And now those criminals began to start throwing things out of the crowd that was staying within the media.”
At least 30 people were reportedly arrested on Monday evening, and Johnson blamed criminals from outside of Ferguson for agitating along with residents of Ferguson and St. Louis. Criminals from California and New York were among those who were reportedly arrested on Monday evening.
Johnson said they were grateful to the media for what they have done and the journalists who have “been our partners in reporting,” but they emphasized that those walking around with handkerchiefs around their faces and talking about nothing but violence are not protesters. They said the media should be careful about giving them publicity and putting them on air.

A Plaquemine man was arrested in Lafayette and booked Thursday (Oct. 27) in Iberville Parish on two charges of murder related to crimes dating back to 1991, WAFB reports.
Tommy Francise, 61, of Plaquemine, was booked on two counts of second-degree murder after officials say there's evidence to show he's responsible for the killings of two men who had worked for him, the TV station reports.
According to the report, Francise' arrests are in connection to the murders of Curtis "Cochise" Smith, who was killed 1991, and of George Barrett Jr., who was killed in 2002.
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican signed its first treaty with the “State of Palestine” on Friday, calling for “courageous decisions” to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and backing a two-state solution.
The treaty, which made official the Vatican's de facto recognition of Palestine since 2012, angered Israel, which called it “a hasty step (that) damages the prospects for advancing a peace agreement”.
Israel also said it could have implications on its future diplomatic relations with the Vatican.
The accord, which concerns the Catholic Church's activities in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, also confirmed the Vatican's increasingly proactive role in foreign policy under Pope Francis. Last year, it brokered the historic resumption of ties between the United States and Cuba.
Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican's foreign minister, said at the signing that they hoped it could be a “stimulus to bringing a definitive end to the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continues to cause suffering for both parties”.
They called for peace negotiations held directly between Israelis and Palestinians to resume and lead to a two-state solution. “This certainly requires courageous decisions, but it will also offer a major contribution to peace and stability in the region,” they said.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Al-Malki said they hoped it would help “recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, freedom and dignity in an independent state of their own, free from the shackles of occupation”.
The Vatican is particularly keen to have a greater diplomatic role in the Middle East, from where many Christians have fled because of conflicts in Syria, Iraq and other countries.
There are about 100,000 Catholics of the Roman and Greek Melkite rites in Israel and the Palestinian territories, most of them Palestinians.
Gallagher said the agreement “may serve as a model for other Arab and Muslim majority countries” with regard to freedom of religion and conscience.
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2012 recognizing Palestine as an observer non-member state. This was welcomed at the time by the Vatican, which has the same observer non-member status at the United Nations.
Since then the Vatican has de facto recognized a “State of Palestine” and the pope referred to it by that name when they visited the Holy Land last year.
Some 135 members of the United Nations recognize Palestine, nearly 70 percent of the total. By comparison, 160 of the UN's 193 members recognize Israel.
Last October, Sweden became the first major European country to acknowledge Palestine, a decision that drew condemnation from Israel and has since led to tense relations between the two.
The European Union as a whole does not recognize Palestine, taking the same view as the United States that an independent country can emerge only via negotiations with Israel, not through a process of unilateral recognition.
While everyone was busy celebrating the New Year last evening with parties, revelry and resolution-making, "a US federal judge reaffirmed the Obama administration policy granting officials the authority to search American's laptops, citing a controversial premise that makes citizens within 100 miles of the border eligible for a police check."
According to RT.com:
District Judge Edward Korman made their ruling in New York on Tuesday, more than three years after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed suit. The ACLU claimed that - since Americans put so much of their lives on their computers, cell phones, and other devices – border officials should have reasonable suspicion before sifting through someone's personal files.

Trending: Ex-CNN Reporter Amber Lyon Explains How They Fake The News Attorneys argued that searches conducted without reasonable suspicion are a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.
Not so, according to Judge Korman. In their decision Tuesday they argued that the area 100 miles inland falls under a "border exemption."
Before going any further, it's important to note the context of the situation under which the suit was filed.
In 2010, Pascal Abidor, a 29 year old Islamic studies student, was traveling by Amtrak rail from Canada to their parent's home in New York. Abidor was sitting in the train's cafe car when an officer approached Abidor, forced them to take out their laptop, and ordered them to enter their password. Mr. Abidor had their laptop confiscated for 11 days. On the laptop were photos of Hamas and Hezbollah rallies and agents, which according to Abidor were related to their studies. The officer handcuffed Abidor, keeping them detained for over three hours and questioning them numerous times.
With this in mind, Judge Edward Korman stated this in their ruling:
"Laptops have only come into widespread use in the twenty-first century. Prior to that time, lawyers, photographers, and scholars managed to travel overseas and consult with clients, take photographs, and conduct scholarly research." "No one ever suggested the possibility of a border search had a chilling effect on their or their First Amendment rights. While it is true that laptops make overseas work more convenient, the precaution plaintiffs may choose to take to 'mitigate' the alleged harm associated with the remote possibility of a border search are simply among the many inconveniences associated with international travel."
Everyone is aware, if you have traveled internationally, that the US conducts searches on travelers entering and leaving the country. However, Congress expanded on this policy when the Department of Homeland Security was created and 33 checkpoints established "inside the country where people are stopped and asked to prove their citizenship." These checkpoints have nothing to do with international travel through international entry points into the United States.
Take a look at this map of the United States outlining the 100 mile Constitution free zone along the borders.
Florida, Hawaii, and almost the entire northeast section of the country are contained in Constitution free zones because of their location as Border States. According to the ACLU, almost two-thirds of the population or 197.4 million people live within the 100 mile zone. Dozens of metropolitan cities and areas also fall within this area where police checks may occur that is known as the "exemption" zone. The Department of Homeland Security's own data indicates that between 2008 and 2010, 6500 people had their devices searched, half being US citizens.
So, if you are living in a border state within the 100 mile zone, you are subject to the same searches and seizures as those who are traveling internationally. Doesn't that make you feel secure?
The ACLU is considering filing an appeal.
In reading the Fourth Amendment, there is no mention of exception with international travel, which even though uncommon doing those times, was occurring by ship and possibly by wagon into Canada. The Fourth Amendment was written at a time when computers where not even conceivable. However, cannot a computer, an iPhone, an iPad or other electronic device be considered an "effect" or a "thing?" Once an American citizen shows identification, shouldn't that be the end of the story at an international entry point or elsewhere, unless a specific warrant is issued under the Fourth Amendment? Better yet, why are any of these things being done at all to American citizens?
All of this has nothing to do with terrorism or illegal immigration. If that is the claim, isn't the NSA spying on everyone, datamining their information and storing it for years supposed to be thwarting terrorism by this activity? That is the NSA claim; however, this is the same agency whose contractors were using their positions to spy on exes and love interests. If the NSA was even remotely thwarting terrorism, why did they not catch the Boston Bombers beforehand? Wasn't it the NSA and the FBI who came out afterward saying they had information about these Boston Bombers? It's akin to Nostradamus fans saying they predicted 9/11 over 500 years ago only after the tragedy occurred.
As far as illegal immigration goes, the Congress is proposing amnesty for the millions here in violation of the law. Why does Homeland Security need to determine citizenship of anyone, not coming through international entry points, when all they are going to do is turn around and allow anyone in the country illegally to receive impunity? In getting down to brass tacks, the entire Southern border is over-run with people crossing into the country daily without going through so much as a Kleenex check. The entire Southern border is an international entry point as it has been discovered that Mexican citizens are not the only ones entering our country illegally by crossing the unsecured area.
No, this has nothing to do with any of that. It is all about conditioning the American public to accept and comply with violations upon their God-given rights, in essence, silently consent to the erosion of the Constitution. Those border state residents who are completely engulfed in a Constitution free zone should be outraged, along with anyone living in any of these areas. It is boiling down to a "papers please" initiative indicative of the oppression seen in East Germany and the former USSR. It is a lead in to a greater exertion of government control for an agenda that has yet to be completely exposed.
UPDATE:
I recently received an email from a Freedom Outpost reader who stated that in this article, the 100 mile border constitution free zone, where suspicion-less and warrant-less searches of American citizens' effects could occur, did not only pertain to the external boundaries of the United States but also to ports of entry. This would include international airports within the internal framework of the United States where direct international flights arrive and depart.
In researching this new information, 8 CFR 287.1 – definitions concerning external boundaries and reasonable distances was discovered. External boundaries mean "as used in section 287(a)(3) of the Act, means the land boundaries and the territorial sea of the United States extending 12 nautical miles from the baselines of the United States determined in accordance with international law." The definition of "reasonable distance" is "as used in section 287(a) (3) of the Act, means within 100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States or any shorter distance which may be fixed by the chief patrol agent for CBP, or the special agent in charge for ICE, or, so far as the power to board and search aircraft is concerned any distance fixed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section."
Paragraph (b) states:
Reasonable distance; fixing by chief patrol agents and special agents in charge. In fixing distances not exceeding 100 air miles pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, chief patrol agents and special agents in charge shall take into consideration topography, confluence of arteries of transportation leading from external boundaries, density of population, possible inconvenience to the traveling public, types of conveyances used, and reliable information as to movements of persons effecting illegal entry into the United States: Provided, That whenever in the opinion of a chief patrol agent or special agent in charge a distance in their or their sector or district of more than 100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States would because of unusual circumstances be reasonable, such chief patrol agent or special agent in charge shall forward a complete report with respect to the matter to the Commissioner of CBP, or the Assistant Secretary for ICE, as appropriate, who may, if they determine that such action is justified, declare such distance to be reasonable.
In reviewing Judge Korman's decision, page 13 of the 32 page finding references the US Customs and Border Protection Strategic Plan for Securing America's Borders at Ports of Entry. On page 36 of the Strategic Plan, Objective 4.1 established the strategy and action enabling CBP to secure Port of Entry (POE) to effectively perform its mission. The first paragraph sentence states, "CBP cannot allow facilities limitations to put the security of the nation at risk." Listed as the first bullet point under "Strategies and Actions" is this statement, "Define the spaces and facilities at POEs that CBP needs authority over to meet its mission, including conducting assessments, inspections and enforcement."
Does this mean the CBP at a Port of Entry could declare a 100 mile radius around that POE as a constitution free zone? It is plausible and a possibility. With that in mind, it would increase the areas around the country around international internal ports of entry subject to violations of the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. This would mean that more individuals are living within constitution free zones than previously thought.
NOW PLAYING In Now Playing articles PC Gamer writers talk about the game currently dominating their spare time. Today, Jon digs in to Planet Coaster's challenge mode.
I shouldn't make light of what is a very serious disease, but I'm starting to think all the people in my park have diabetes. “Many guests are thirsty”, the pop-up notifications keep telling me, despite there being three Gulpee Slush kiosks and a shake stand on site to slake their seemingly unquenchable need for sickly sweet fluids. I click on the facilities menu and add another Cosmic Cow Milkshake stand. You're welcome.
While I happily played through all Planet Coaster's career mode scenarios, a few months on I can't recall any standout moments. But visually the game is so damn good I'm trying to turn ‘like' into ‘love' by applying myself to a series of increasingly testing objectives as they roll out in Challenge mode.
I've chosen the desert setting, which generally requires Western-themed attractions, and my first challenge is to reach a Park Balance Bonus of 20. The steady addition of rides of all types and assorted cowpokery from the props menu lands me the $1,000 reward in half an hour or so. I hold off employing a mechanic and a janitor until the first ride breaks and litter and vomit lie mosaiclike on all the paths to the extent that it's affecting the park's rating. The game is big on calculating the likelihood of guest regurgitation—get things wrong and you'd better make sure your janitors are motivated and well paid.
Planet Coaster also places great emphasis on the need for its parks and particularly its queues to have interesting scenery so that patrons don't lose interest and drift off. The requirements of the challenges rise incrementally until I'm asked to achieve a Park Rating of 900. More rides get placed—all linked with the flexible path-building tool—then god-like, I frantically slam down Joshua trees and cacti by the score. I employ gun-slinging entertainer Miss Elly, which I doubt makes much difference in the scheme of things but the kids seem to like watching them twirling and fanning them six-shooters.
I'm asked to construct a coaster 1,000 metres long, which I custom-build from steel with relative ease. Further coaster-based objectives reveal themselves so I keep reconfiguring that first American Arrow to incorporate the new requirements, which include building progressively longer coasters and providing five or more seconds of airtime. Eventually, I have a 3,000- metre-long creation that's ugly and has a footprint the size of Utah. I reduce the fear and nausea ratings using the excellent track smoothing tool while the test results show that I'm up to nine seconds of airtime.
Another notification pops up: “Many guests need the toilet”. Well what if I don't want to build one? Will desperate guests relieve themselves against the stanchions of the nearest ride? Will their Bermuda shorts add a new meaning to the term ‘motion capture'?
Planet Coaster's Challenge mode cleverly alternates the objectives between the practical (rides and facilities) and the aesthetic (themes and scenery) until a few hours in, surprise surprise, you find you've built an amusement park that's vibrant and densely packed with lots of colourful features. Sitting back satisfied, I'm just about to save and exit when it happens again: “Many guests are thirsty”. What is wrong with these people?
